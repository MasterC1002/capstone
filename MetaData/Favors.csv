1355846772.0,1520wd,[Request]I am deaf and I would like a video of my late Grandfather captioned.  I can't understand what he is saying and I would really like to.,Whoa_Bundy,995,144,206,"I've had this video for years where he did an interview for the Canadian legion and talks about his experiences during WW2.  However two things prevented me from watching it.  Youth and I'm deaf. 

He was alive and I was 17 when I got a copy of it.  I'm now 32 and he has since passed away.  I watched the video and teared up just seeing him but I can't understand what he is saying.  I would love for this to be captioned.  

The video is 38 minutes and I know this can be very time consuming.   

If anyone has a suggestion for a website that I can pay to have this done

Most sites I've found will send you the transcript but I would like someone to encode the captioning on the video itself.  I have it in .MP4 format and its about 470MB.

Thanks for looking

**EDIT** - Wow
).  I'm not sure how we can work out who transcribes which part. 


Thanks again for the offers.  I can't wait to follow the video while reading the transcript.  

**EDIT 2** - I've gotten an offer from someone who is willing to encode the captions in the video itself and get it back to me.* 

**EDIT 3** - I don't want anyone give up their time if someone else has already completed it so as soon as I get either a transcript or a video with the captions included

**EDIT 8 - (Wed, transcription services, medical transcriptionist, and accessibility at Google.

So I believe what I have to do now is get ahold of the transcript file and possibly upload it to YouTube.  I was told that if I upload the transcript to YouTube  - without timecodes - and YouTube will use speech recognition technology to automatically align the text of the transcript with what it hears in the video

I also have replied to the professionals in the field and waiting to see the outcomes of those.

**EDIT 9 - (Thursday, let me know it was ready.  I sent the video and transcript file to a professional captionist who graciously offered his services for free.  He will be encoding the video for me and then I'll upload it to YouTube with the captions.  I may have to re-send him the transcript files since there has been a few clarifications and edits recently.  I'll update when the video is online. 

I've tried to refrain from reading just the transcripts because I really want to the full impact of watching his facial expressions and body language as I read what he is saying on the screen.  I did give in and read maybe the first 5 minutes and I've already learned so much.  

I just want to say that if you have Grandparents still around

**EDIT 10 - (Thurs, and on my hard drive.  Still working on getting in up onto YouTube and the transcript uploaded too.  I tried last night but it got stuck in the ""processing"" part.  Wouldn't finalize the upload.  

**EDIT 11 - (Fri

I think this is going to be my final edit.  Or maybe just one more after I submit the video to YouTube with the captions forced/burned in instead of using YouTubes transcribe.  Just an idea.

Basically, but I am by no means a poor person. When he initially made his offer to lend me the money

There was some talk about paying the loan forward in /r/favors or donating it to charity. It's been over 6 months, I would have paid him with my first paycheck. I don't blame alltriophagy for this confusion, the blame falls on me for not following-up and being certain. What can I say, relocating 2000 miles from home takes a lot of time and energy, and I just spaced. For that I apologize.

 Now, I comment a lot and get A LOT of replies every day. Sometimes I just don't have time to check them all and they go unnoticed. If it was via email, I don't use my paypal email for my main personal account, so I definitely wouldn't have seen them there. I was not failing to respond to him on purpose, I genuinely did not know he had messaged me. 

That all being said, I can deal with. Hell, I can even deal with my name being dragged through the mud. What I cannot deal with, is my elderly mother being harassed on a daily basis for something that is a simple misunderstanding. I mean, he called me out, I addressed it and agreed to rectify it, and yet my mother still had her phone unplugged because some asshole tracked down my real name and somehow came up with her phone number. He/they have been calling her every day, she has had to unplug her phone from the wall. Do you know what that means, that's fucked. 

All I can say is that this has been a huge eye-opener. I'm not a scammer, I annoy the shit out of them constantly telling them what they're missing by not joining. I participate in all the secret santas, have helped out other Redditors in need in /r/favors, and have even let a Redditor down on his luck sleep on my couch for 2 weeks. But now, that faith and love I had has been tarnished with this ugly blemish. I'll most likely have to delete my account, since there is obviously enough personal info to track down my mother somewhere in it and I don't have the time to go through years of comments, and I most definitely won't be involving myself in /r/favors anymore. 

I know this means absolutely nothing on the internet, and she doesn't deserve this. 


P.S. I just want to point out that I in no way blame allotriophagy for any of the other issues that have stemmed from this. He has been nothing but a gentleman when we have spoken

Dear Honorable Judge

I not only acknowledge the atrocious mistake that I’ve made, an action that in and of itself could be considered a crime.  My sentence will be one that, no matter how lenient or severe, I believe I will be serving for the rest of my life.

I understand and respect that you have a job to do and by no means, but also the human being that committed it.  The crime that was committed was not done with malicious intent, in fact it was not even committed with the intent of profit.  It was done with the sincere interest of helping a friend in danger. I am an Honors student at The Art Institute, one of the most respected art conservatories in the country.  I have written a Children’s Book, whose proceeds go to a charity that benefits the disabled.  I am a tutor for a Catholic School Child that suffers from a learning disability called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, who is willing to testify to the inspiring progress made under my tutelage.  I direct product strategy at an exciting new tech startup that aims at revolutionizing the way people interact with their computers.  But above all this, I am a dedicated father of a beautiful 6 year old boy.

I am 30 years old.  I am at an age where most citizens are are either laying down or building upon the foundations by which they will live the rest of their lives.  My biggest fear throughout this ordeal is that this mistake will throw me in a hole from which I won’t be able to climb out.  

I don’t consider myself, should you show leniency in this matter under condition that if I was ever even caught jaywalking again, I’d get life in prison, I’d sign it without a single hesitation.
	
This is the human being that you are sentencing today. I beg your leniency


That's all I've got so far.  It's really hard for me to write about myself... so please

1283727172.0,d9z1m,"[MOD] /r/Favors is going back to being about ""favors.""  If what you need is money, a handout or large-scale welfare, head over to /r/assistance.",kleinbl00,256,40, I thank you.  In addition

Well, letting a few in became quite a force multiplier; we saw a jump in posts from people who weren't so much asking for a ""favor"" as they were asking for ""money.""  Hell, I got a half-dozen PMs from people directly asking *me* for help.  And that, to me, is not what this subreddit is about.

I've spent some time thinking about what

###A ""Favor"" is something you ask of a peer.

As in, so can you send me one?""  or ""I've got a bunch of old DVDs that aren't doing anything; I'd love it if someone sent me stuff they didn't need so that's what I'm going to do.""  ""Favors"" are the reason this subreddit exists.

###A ""Boon"" is something a supplicant asks of a superior.

As in, please help me out, I'm happy to prove that I'm totally broke.""

""Proving I'm totally broke"" is undignified.  I don't think it should be about ""worthyness.""  I think it should be about peers helping peers and when requests become huge like that

So from now on, determine to be a ""favor"" are getting punted to /r/Assistance.  [this /r/assistance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/d56cn/you_may_have_noticed_the_emergence_of_rassistance/)  Yeah, that's the one.  They've got qgyh2 and RedGPZ moderating over there now, though, so I trust 'em.

Thanks for helping in this grand social experiment

1307720419.0,hwg2u,Cheer up a 103 year old man!,kinderdoc,243,39,105,"Hi Reddit

 He is a retired electrical engineer who loves baseball, taught 3 generations of children how to ride bicycles and drive, has an encyclopedic memory of classic movies and is still quick with the one liners and puns. It breaks my heart that I can't be there with him more often and don't know how much time he has left. He has kept up with technology but not to the point where he can email, mostly since he never learned to type, but has a digital camera and printer that he uses to good effect, and thinks touchscreen technology is fascinating. (I submit this information to put in context his mental state. He's not doddering Grandpa Simpson, he's still very much a viable mentally sharp person). I thought about doing an AMA, and it wouldn't be very efficient. 

If anyone wants to send him a card, but obviously doesn't drive anymore and I know he feels very trapped and bored. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it! It's hard thinking of appropriate gifts for a housebound centenarian. PM me for his address if you're interested.    



   

**Edit 3** Sending him some pictures from where you are, it's the only downside to digital photography as far as he's concerned. Cheap, creative and heartfelt, the best kind of gift!    

**Edit 4** Postcards are a great idea too!

**A little backstory:** My great-grandma raised me when I was little while my mom was working a full-time job and earning her degree. So

She was completely self-sufficient her entire life until about three years ago. At 92, drove her own car and could still pull weeds in the yard. Then shortly after Christmas, my mom found her face-down on the floor of her bedroom after having suffered a stroke.

She's been in a nursing home for almost three years now, but no longer knows who I am when I go to see her. She will talk about me in front of me, as though I were a complete stranger. And it absolutely breaks my heart.

[EDIT] Did I mention the house is in the [Google Fibre region?](https://fiber.google.com/cities/kcmo/#header=signup-eligible&amp;street_address=3418+Bellefontaine+Ave&amp;unit_number=&amp;city=Kansas+City&amp;state=MO&amp;zip_code=64128-1952&amp;addr_class=1&amp;addr_id=knssmo09738093&amp;addr_state=MO&amp;estimate_date=Fall+2013&amp;address_status=2&amp;fiberhood=knssmoopnf06&amp;addr_latlng=39.0636561567

Hi Reddit!
So I want to be perfectly honest about all of this and I will be as detailed as possible. The house it not a fancy one [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3418-Bellefontaine-Ave-Kansas-City-MO-64128/2333805_zpid/) and I have never even been there. I live in Sweden my self and bought it as a stupid kid in 2008 as an investment.

I wasn´t scammed, I own the house, have never been there, there is probably someone living there (squatter) and I have no idea about any propertytaxes or anything. I fucked up big time and this house is more of a headache than an asset and I want to get rid of it. So I thought why not give it to someone more deserving than me?

As you can tell I need help giving it away and I hope someone will be able to assist me in this.

[EDIT]
I have realized that this house will have a bunch of propertytaxes built up so this ""gift"" might not be for anyone. I would love to help and pay the taxes but I don´t have that kind of money. So again, but I know that there are redditors out there or someone you know that this would be a perfect possibility for. Give me your best shot! Oh, and please check out [the game I am trying to make with two friends](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1153540957/the-ring-first-journey)
/EDIT

So give me your suggestions and let´s find someone a house before christmas!
I figured that maybe reddit will allow me to lift forward my first iOS game project thingy kickstarter event and hopefully get a boost. It would really mean a lot to me. The game is a action-version of the old ""buzzer game"" you used to play on carnivals where you have a metalring that you drag along a metal wire without touching.

So

During that time I was getting to know a girl really well and I was very interested in her but we were not yet dating. We had become good friends over the past year or so and were hanging out with a group of friends. We have this ongoing argument/joke which would be hard to explain but it involves proving that the other person has ""a heart of gold."" So during one of our fake arguments I seize the opportunity to drop the Tanzania ""friend."" I say ""I bet you

Fast forward 5 months and her and I are a month into our relationship and I pick her up for a date when she turns to me, started the car and simply said ""Oh what did it say?"" and she read it. To which I replied ""Yup, thats true. See I told you so."" and just kept driving like normal. She was completely dumbfounded. I could tell she was confused because she knows me and that I set this up somehow but didnt know how I pulled it off. She said ""Wow, you're the most awesome boyfriend ever!"" and I felt like a million dollars.

**Humans evaluate your reports.**  Nothing happens to a ""reported link"" or ""reported comment"" until I

**Clicking the ""Report"" button is the equivalent of drawing the ref's attention to a foul play.**  The ref may not give you your foul

It would honestly be a big, if you clicked that button more often.  If you wanted to go the extra mile, you could even message the moderators - we aren't omniscient, we aren't omnipresent and this is a community-run community, even if only three of us wear striped shirts.

Do me a favor.  ~~Click ""report"" on this submission.  Do it now.~~^2  I'll tell you to stop at some point

The system *does* work and we'd love your help in keeping it going.  Thanks for everything

 - your friendly neighborhood moderator

That is the link to the original post.  I am sorry I haven't updated sooner
Here is the letter I printed out on vellum from santa:

My Dearest *X*
The bright eyed little elf (that I believe you call cabby) who resides in your home  brought me your letter.  Oh how I thought and thought about your wishes and how I could grant them best.  You see, they need you and people like you to remain human.  Animals require protection and care, and you my darling *X* are just the type of human that they look to for those very things.  The kings and Queens of the beasts were flattered by your desire to become one of them.  So much so that they did something I have never seen before!  Each of the Kings and Queens of the Council of Beasts put a bit of their spirits into a special container just for you. Their hope is that when you find yourself in need of a little something to help in your journey through life, that you will look to the bit of spirit that they gave to you for guidance.   I had my elves make you a special necklace that can hold just enough of the animal spirits to guide you through your journey.  Place a tiny bit of whatever animal spirit you require into the pendant and wear it as long as you need the aide of that animals spirit.  My animal friends and I are very proud of you *X*.  Your kindness to humans and animals alike is a big part of making your second wish come true.  World peace is something that can only happen when people like you go out into the world and  spread peace and love to all who inhabit this earth.  

Forever your friend
Saint Nicholas

I got called up after twenty or so people that the judge didn't seem to like and I was pretty afraid I'd caught him on a bad day. He told me I was charged with the sale of a controlled species and then turned to the District Attorney for the deal and the DA said

At this point the judge looked at the citation and read it for a moment, ""I didn't even know that was illegal?!?!?"" At which point the whole story came out while he laughed and the whole rest of the court people (DA, secretary lady, bailiff, other people on the docket) started laughing. He looked to the DA to get a new deal and the DA said, ""$150 and court costs."" 

This is where it got funny. The judge actually gave the, and I only have to pay court costs assuming I don't re-offend in the next two years.

**Your Business and Target Audience**

* What is the exact business name as you would like it to appear?

* What do you do? What's your industry

* What are 3 things you want to express to your target audience?

**The Logo**

* What type of logo are you looking for? Text-only, etc.?

* Are there examples of logos that you really like? What about ones that you dislike?

* What colors would you like to be incorporated? What colors do you want to avoid? Should the number of colors be limited

* Great typefaces (fonts) can really make a logo shine, what budget should we keep in mind?

*  Are there any specific elements you'd like included? (ex: any specific shapes or motifs)

*  If you would like an image used in your logo

*  Any other preferences we should know about?

**The Files**

*Raster images (JPG, and others) are made out of pixels, or tiny dots. If you resize a raster image too dramatically, these pixels become distorted and the image doesn’t look too pretty. They are fine to use, but you'll often need to generate a new raster image for each necessary size if you want to keep the file size down and preserve the logo's integrity and quality. Vector images (AI, EPS, SVG, on the other hand, it is a good practice to acquire both a vector and raster format for your logo.*

* Are you able to open vector files? Check to see if you have programs like Adobe Illustrator

*  If you have a specific use for the logo in mind

*  If you have a specific use for the logo in mind

As a gentle reminder, wait a week or two.  We try really hard to keep this place interesting and as fascinated as you are by your WOW clan, the rest of us likely aren't.

If somebody would be nice enough to let us stay in their vacation home, I'd be more than happy to pay for a cleaning company to come in and clean after we leave.  We're not dirty by any means, but I would assume that this would be a normal step taken after a person rents a vacation home.

He kept touching my lower abs and it was still pretty sore. He touched my appendix. And it was pretty sore. He didn't like the grunting noise I made. So I was sent to get blood test, and told me I was to go straight to the ER. When I went to the ER I was given this liquid to drink, and proceeded to take cat scan. All the test proved true, And I had my appendix removed. What went from me driving myself to a normal checkup turned into me staying the night and getting surgery. Now I'm in pain ugh.

I got cards from several of the states and many foreign countries, Afghanistan, the UK, Mexico and Canada (I'm sure I'm forgetting a few).

1280257943.0,cuc7n,"[request] Please help better define ""Blogspam.""",kleinbl00,94,15,59,"So I've long had a bone to pick with /r/pics because they favor relinking to Imgur rather than linking to the site that hosts the picture - in theory

Part of the problem was the whole [RobInGallup/Saydrah dustup](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7yf2/by_request_dear_saydrah_love_rob_in_gallup/c0lesd5) basically illustrated the dangers of calling something ""blogspam"" when it isn't and how sensitive the issue is - and part of the problem is that ""blogspam"" is *really poorly defined right now.*

So based on discussion in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cu6h6/reddit_vs_digg/c0vbaa8) I'm hypothesizing that if Reddit in general had a less nebulous understanding of what Blogspam *is* we might have better luck keeping it in check without simply offloading everything onto Imgur... [A habit not without controversy.](http://www.brentcsutoras.com/2010/02/08/imgur-stolen-content-social-medias-double-standard/)

So I contributed this:

 -  Whether ""the average person, taken as a whole, is more about drawing pageviews for monetization by the submitter than it is about providing the community with entertainment

 -  Whether the link contains

 - Whether the link

      I want to say thank you to the favors community for embracing this offer so much, and I will admit it's alot bigger than I initially anticipated and as warned did take up most of the time. I do not know for certain if I will continue to list after I finish. While many of you accepted my offer some had me do the work and then never looked at it, or responded when I emailed you letting you know I had finished it. This makes me a bit hesitant to continue, but if I continue the projects or do this again in the future I will definitely know how to manage it better. But above all I do want to state how grateful I am to everyone who helped.


The time has come for me to give a bit back to a community whom has given so much to me over the last few months. I am a Graphic Designer whom has worked for a large corporation part and full time since 2008. However I am finally planning to break free and go freelance full time in about 6 weeks. The advantage of this is that I've learned alot of the years

That being said I want to spend 30 days of the next 6 weeks giving back to reddit. For this reason I will be offering up my talents, and once completed pick up three more. You can make requests as large or small as you would like, but keep in mind that the longer the project the less time others will be able to get.

So what's the catch? Just give me the okay to post the finished product on my portfolio. That's pretty much it. I specialize in print media advertisements and branding. Think business cards

**Quick Update since I've gotten a couple emails about this** I specialize in print media and branding

**Another Update** I apologize if I am not responding immediately to your emails. I am still in the office and am doing these projects in my free time. I will respond to all questions when I am at home at 4pm PST

04:00 PST: As promised I am at my home office working away. Alright so here's the thing. This has gotten way more responses than I anticipated and I am very grateful! This is going to make for some strong work

One other thing I wanted to add is that requests should be sent to BlackSkullDesigns@Gmail.com if you have a long explanation or additional details you want to add. This is also a faster way of getting ahold of me as I have now linked this email to my phone.

The last thing I want to say is thank you to all of you. I was timid about doing this thinking no one would respond and here I would have a site up and running with little over a dozen 3 - 4 year old projects posted. This community truly appreciates it's artists and as someone whom spent many years living off ramen you have no idea how much I appreciate seeing this kind of out pour.

Alright redditors were up to 10 projects. I will PM you when it's your turn. Until I finish these I will not be taking on any additional work. 

*I will keep updating the list with redditors whom send me requests via email. But please note I do not produce

UPDATE I am getting started on the projects and will mark them on the list as 'Done' once completed. I have officially locked myself away in the office! Also a very big welcome to the kind redditor whom gifted me with reddit gold. 

08AUG2011 - I had to stay in ill today folks. Regretfully not much progress was made. Check back tomorrow.

10AUG2011 - I am back up and running! The cold tried to kick my ass but it failed. More projects published tonight and more replies to emails.
Thank you to everyone for being patient.

21AUG2011 - I am still working through the projects! I've come to the conclusion that instead of trying to get all of these projects crammed into 30 consecutive days I will continue to work on them until I have worked for 30 total days. Look for more projects to be posted soon!

1314088122.0,jriet,"[Request] Longshot: Can anyone in San Jose, CA, help me get my bike frame back? It's not stolen, a douchebag bus driver forced me to abandon it.",cralledode,7, and he went and got the frame for me this morning

Faith in humanity: restored. Thanks so much to those who offered to help, free of charge.

x-post from /r/bayarea, so that's why I cross-posted it.

**tl;dr: After spending the week finding the perfect bike frame for my new project bike, BART, VTA 180X, and VTA Light Rail over two connections, for &gt;60miles, I had to leave it in San Jose. The operator of the very last HWY17 Express, which would take me for the final 30 miles of my 90 mile trip, and forced me to abandon it at Diridon Station at 10:45PM. Can anybody in San Jose get it

I can't afford a car, and it needs a lot of maintenance. I also use it for camping and groceries, but I don't need a touring bike to get to work, which is less than a mile away.

So, but the town is just too small, and there aren't enough bikes laying around for an available one to fit my needs.

This weekend, for a graduation party. I got a little cash from relatives, and lo and behold, the one day I'm in the Bay Area, I find a frame that fits me, that is well within my budget, and in the style I was looking for. I cancelled my plans for the day

The seller was a 30-something African American dude, but it turns out this guy lives in a really nice neighborhood, so I went to meet him. He rolled up in a lexus and stepped out wearing a tasteful suit. He shook my hand firmly and told me about how he needs the frame out of his back yard. He wanted to fix it up, but realized he didn't have the time to pull it off.

I gave him my email address and told him I'd send him an imgur album with the full restoration

I took the bike on the AC Transit bus, and I was going to fix it.

I took it on BART

On the VTA bus from Fremont to San Jose, for decades, he made extra money by going around San Jose with his pickup truck and getting bikes out of the trash for restoration. He runs a locksmith business, and apparently he had his son ask all their customers, after closing the deal, if they had any bikes laying around in their back yard that they wanted to get rid of. He said he focused mainly on old Schwinns, and he named his son something like ""Shaun

Apparently, unlike the 181X, didn't go to Diridon station, but only to the Great Mall. His girlfriend gave me a VTA Day Pass for free, so that I didn't have to pay for the light rail. She also gave me her boyfriend's phone number so I could call him for any Schwinn parts I needed for the project.

**EDIT: Giving me his phone number wound up getting me the bike back. YAY!**

This whole confusion led me to missing the 2nd-to-last Highway 17 bus to Santa Cruz

Finally, and when I boarded with the frame slung over my shoulder, the driver said, ""I can't let you take that on the bus. It's got sharp edges.""

(This is from memory

I said

He goes: ""Not in here.""

Me: ""But this is the _last bus._""

Him: ""I know. Lock it up and drive back for it.""

Me: ""I don't have a lock

Him: ""Well

Me: ""There are like 6 other people on here

Him: ""I'M NOT ARGUING ABOUT THIS.""

After that, but he yelled the same thing at them.

Eventually

http://soundcloud.com/jbosecke/sets/reddit-1

Edit: You guys are crazy in a good way. I'm still working on your ideas but I won't be uploading them tonight because there is too much noise interference. Come back and check the post occasionally even if I've written you a song. There's guaranteed to be some interesting songs based on some of these ideas and I need the soundcloud views like redditors need their karma. I will get to your idea I promise it just might take a week or so.

Edit #2: Filled up my hour of soundcloud upload time (primary goal achieved) now trying to obtain funds to get a premium account to continue. Also I have weapons grade flu and severely underestimate the dark side of my exam study which is a lot more than I thought I had to do. So my focus is that till the 8th then I'll see how many more requests I can knock off. 

I assume most people have left so if you read this and send me an reddit-mail it means you still frequent the page and are waiting patiently for your song to be made. I will endeavor to make yours a priority but I'm still planning to write them all so I'll keep you posted.

ORIGINAL POST 11/4

I am an English teacher in a Korean elementary school. I started [postcrossing](http://www.postcrossing.com) recently and I love it! 

I was able to get a small budget from my school and after a rough start (had to go all the way to Seoul to get postcards and raided multiple local post offices of their stamps)

**The thing is the other grades (3rd and 4th) found out and they're sad that they aren't getting postcards as well!** =(

***

**So my request is this:** send me a postcard that I can give to my 3rd and 4th grade students. 

*The World and Geography* is slotted for the first two weeks of December and if I could get enough postcards for each student (40 students total) it would be amazing. I'm hoping to integrate it into the lesson.

Postcards clearly displaying the name of your country or city is fantastic. Landscapes, native animals, plants, the national flag etc are greatly welcomed.

Anything else that you think the kids would like that has some tie or relationship to your country and/or culture is really appreciated. 

(They're also fans of baseball

Students learn the alphabet in public school in third grade here but most have been in English academies for a while. I have a range of English levels here so if you just say hello that's fine. Feel free to introduce yourself simply. 


For example

 
* Hi

* I like ____.

* My favorite ___.

or a little something about your family, the weather, favorite food, your hobbies, the postcard, etc. The simpler the better. 

Also **print clearly** as they cannot read cursive.



PM me and I will give you the school address

and feel free to send multiples if you feel so inclined :)

Thanks in advance everyone! I will now attempt to bribe you with [pictures of some of my students.](http://splentastic.imgur.com/little_mites)

1270527644.0,bmy8t,Desperately looking for any job in Seattle.,,89,13,26,"Hi Reddit

I'm an 18 year old in Seattle desperately looking for a job. I'm hoping some Redditor will be able to help out a fellow Redditor and gain a hard working employee in the process.

A bit about me:

I am about to complete my second year of college and receive my associates degree. I went to college two years early with the Running Start program and am so glad I did. I love computers (building, etc) and just generally enjoy people. Most people see me as a very positive guy.

Work experience:

I worked summers full time (40 hr. weeks) with Wright Runstad and Co from when I was 14 to 16. I did everything from cleaning air ducts to picking up cigarette butts to simple mechanical repairs and maintenance in buildings in downtown Seattle and Redmond City Hall (for one summer.)

The summer of my 17th year (and on into the school year) I was employed by Goodman Real Estate. I was lucky enough to net a position on the IT team and I spent the next eight months repairing computers, the IT budget got cut by more than 60% last month and my position was one of the casualties.

I'm willing to do anything, wash dishes. I desperately need to pay for college in the upcoming years. I even took night classes so I could work more, but alas, the layoff was unforeseen. 

Please someone send an application my way! I've been pounding the pavement for about a month now.

One of our good friends who is no longer around once played a song for my brother that we cannot find anywhere.  It was a version of Between the Wars (originally by Billy Bragg I believe) but sang on a 1998 radio show live appearance (I think from what I can gather) by Daniel Grieves from The Watchmen.

I cannot find this anywhere and want to use the song in his wedding in some fashion (maybe a thinking of you from those who cant be there etc..).

I admit I am not a super computer dude that can research this type of thing nor do I know how to get songs for free or by anything other then iTunes (as I always just pay since I am too dumb to get any other way).

If I somehow get for free or at little cost (I am willing to pay and would rather pay so I know someone is getting their dues) I would very much like to make a donation in the name of whom ever helps me on Reddit.

Yesterday


Out of that

I took that idea, so hopefully it could make it to 24 different places. I will then develop the pictures and post them online for everyone to see.

I was thinking I will include some paper so the person can put their location and email address down so we can map out everywhere the camera has been on its journey. Maybe people taking the picture can hold up a sign with the City and Date.  Hopefully the people involved will take a unique pic or something other then their balls or living room and we will get some cool results.

I am just asking for people who might be interested in participating in this project. You would have to pay to ship the camera to the next person. I haven't got the details organized yet


EDIT:

Wow! I'm glad so many people wanna be a part of this. Keep putting your name down and I will send out more then 1 camera. I am going to buy a Reddit Alien USB out of the Reddit store to send with one of the cameras so we have something to put in the picture. I only have enough money to buy 1

Also if there is anyone out there from Asia, please join in. I would like to have the cameras travel to every major continent and as many countries as possible if we can work it out.

Thanks again for the interest and if you still want in



EDIT 2:

Ok everyone. I am going to send out as many disposable cameras as it takes to try to involve everybody who wants in on this. It is going to take me a few days to get everyone's information sorted out and try to put together groups. I will post an update later on this week with more information and hopefully have a few groups made up so everyone can check and make sure they are on one of the list.

Thanks again for participating in this. Hopefully this will turn out to be a success.

I am an elementary school librarian. I want -- I *need* -- your old childhood books. Shabby condition is fine; as long as pages aren't falling out all over the place

Here's a bit about the students I serve and why I am resorting to begging for your charity:

~650 children, either. I have no budget for purchasing new books, and my own resources limit me to the odd bargain bin pickups each month. Our school is also just 10 years old, and the library was only opened to students a little under two years ago. So, while the student body has grown exponentially, the library grows ... well, extremely slowly. It is dominated by books that are very low-interest for these kids.

Based off of what I hear kids asking for on a daily basis

- Choose Your Own Adventure

- Encyclopedia Brown, though!)

- Where's Waldo?

- Origami

- Books on Michael Jackson or the Beatles. For real.

- Anything by Roald Dahl 'cause I've made damn sure these kids love him

- Any Mike Lupica or other sports-related 'boy' novels

All I can really offer in return for your generosity is a thank you letter from the kid(s) who have been asking for these books. For Choose Your Own Adventure donations

Please

And certainly

You will be getting a hat like one of these: 

http://www.flickr.com/photos/liztrim/sets/72157627862051872/

(Try to ignore my derp faces)

In whatever colors you like. Your hat may be made with bulky yarn like in the photos, I will usually choose bulky because I can turn out hats at a higher rate). All yarn I use will be comfortable and of good quality. Nobody likes an itchy hat! 


Here is one I just finished for a Reddit user (this is using worsted weight yarn as opposed to bulky): http://imgur.com/xQTC8


My first happy recipient!
http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ldkk4/why_i_love_reddit_thanks_to_thesavorytrim/


I will basically be doing hats in the order that best suits me and the supplies I have. I typically buy yarn every two weeks, but some people necessitate a trip to the yarn store.


For people requesting strange patterns/beard hats/things other than basic beanies - I will be happy to attempt your requests, you offer to pay me a chunk of money, in which case I will bump you up since that money funds the yarn for other hats! 


//EDIT AGAIN// - I am closing up the queue for now. I will reopen when I am finished with the orders I already have. I am overjoyed by the positive response!

I will transfer some of that old film you have laying around. I usually transfer old home movies. You should see the faces of some people light up when they see those old images again. I like doing it and I feel like I would like to do a random act of kindness for someone who may not be able to afford to transfer there old film. So hit me up. I do film and video transfer as a business here in Portland Oregon. I've been doing it for about 10 years now. If you do something nice for someone else and tell me about it

EDIT: I will transfer it to DVD or mp4 if you want to edit it yourself!

EDIT: So generally I charge .15 per foot for the transfer process. I'm offering this for free because i want to do something nice for someone else who could not do it on their own.
The process i use is pretty awesome in terms of results. I do telecine

--

In short

The idea is simple:

* redditor agrees.
* I send her/him one word (or more if willing).
* he/she writes/prints it down on paper
* redditor sends me the video (should not take long to make
* I edit them all together

You can hide your face behind the paper, places, lights, voices... into one video.

The project is purely for fun

For more information

Thank you!

*Pour les français qui me connaissent : merci de ne pas griller la surprise ! :)*

**EDIT 1**

* The original video contains 365 words (one for each day of the year). Depending on the response
* I'd like to put the result online by January 31st. So ideally receive all participations by Friday 27th

**EDIT 2**

Thank you gals &amp; guys for the amazing response! So far **~~82~~ ~~84~~ 91 redditors** have agreed to film themselves saying a word or two. This is great, and do not hesitate to have more people signed up!

**EDIT 3**

**~~92~~ 93 redditors!** I'm going to let Reddit go into SOPA mode for a day

**EDIT 4**

**98 redditors** as of latest count! I'm sorry if you're waiting for me to send the words out

**EDIT 5** on 2012-01-21

Everyone should have received at least a couple words by now. There is some overlap with words: nearly each participant share her/his words with a couple others

* take the better rendition (audibility
* have an insurance against redditors who would forget about the project and not do their words :)

I'm already receiving videos. Hope to receive all yours soon! Thank you!

**EDIT 6** on 2012-01-30

After a few days of receiving only a dozen of words, many providing both their main words and their two bonus words, giving me the opportunity to choose the best renditions. Thanks!

I started making the final list last Saturday, and had a lot of fun thanks to the many contributions.

If you haven't done your words yet and still want to be part of the project, I'll do them myself.

I'll probably post the final video in one last edit of this post

Here's where we're at for the list. I figure I'll do my best to do a painting a day (roughly). You can receive a digital file, please help me with the shipping. I am not working these days, so that's why I'm offering this... so that I can paint every day, and have an assignment. I'll post the paintings as I make them. I'm going to stop at 30 requests. Once I've finished them, if people are happy with the work, or I don't go batshit insane, we'll do this again.

",tejmin,12, I recently got a job with Sprint. They offer a nice employee discount.  Just before summer, you get to pay a nice Early Termination Fee

Essentially with major wireless providers, and the other $400 throughout the rest of the contract. I've paid $300 of that ($200 deposit, 5 months built into the plan @ $20 a month). 

Here's the deal: I'm looking to do a [Change of Responsibility](http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-2513) on my current plan. If you do one of these, and be eligible for their service. You will need to have a new number activated, as I'm taking my number with me. [According to this,](http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3361) that fee potentially may be waived, and if they do charge $35 for a new number, I'll split it with you. 

I'm paying $88 bucks a month currently, through Samsung's proprietary Kies software. It's pretty tight. The phone itself is damn near perfect condition, as I take care of my electronics. I've got the box with the manual, and the charger as well. 


I'm looking for someone in the Denver area to do this with, and I can be assured that the phone is wiped. No offense, I just don't want you calling up my peoples.  T-Mobile has great service that I've experienced. I live in Arvada and work in the Tech Center. The only troubles I have are when I'm in a building, however I'm nearly always connected to WIFI when I'm inside. I want to wait until I receive my Sprint phone, which should arrive to me in less than a week.

Galaxy S II, 1.97Gb system/internal memory, 11.25Gb storage memory, Black. Bodyglove case (white with gray accents). 

18 months on a T-Mobile Contract. Currently, unlimited data (2 Gb on 4G speed, the rest on Edge network speed). It currently costs me 88 bucks a month. 

You don't have to pay that pesky $200 deposit on a phone.

I'm out of projects

Edit: Any recent platform. Well

Edit 2:

Current List of projects:

1. ~~00spool: Fraction Converter. Finished.~~
2. TrollyG-Yo: Automagical credits removal from a series of videos.
3. DriftingMemes: Simple ticket tracking system. Probably gonna use Django.
4. lskalt: Simple IRC bot that plays a card game.
5. ~~silent_p: 500x500 pixel random color image creation.~~ Completed by Scalawag.
6. kenkopin: Awesome settings manager and reverter for Windows. 
7. The_Art_God: EXIF recursive image renamer.
8. glowinthedark: Theatre seat reservation system.

Edit 3: The_Art_God isn't responding to my PM

Edit 4: I couldn't help myself. Sorry, and it's turning out the simplest.

I can't promise a time frame on any of these

Edit 5: Since many of those who request projects aren't still around

    00spools fraction converter: 
    Pretty simple. Take the input txt file, take the first argument of that result as a string, and take the fraction as a string.split('/'), cast the two results as floats, convert back to a string, return that, concatenate it
    
    The_Art_God's EXIF recursive renamer:
    Not as easy. I think I'll take an os.walk through each subdirectory from the path provided, partition that with a space delimiter. Take the partition[0] and do partition[0].split('/"") and use the year, month, date format to assign the appropriate file prefix, do a simple ""'mv %s %s' % (file,date_fix+os.path(file))"" or something similar *nix platforms, 'rename' with similar arguments on windows. 
    
    TrollyG-Yo's Automagical credits:
    Simple enough. Read a directory's XML file, just very dependent on platform specific paths. cfgparser will be necessary if I want it to be cross platform.
    
    DriftingMemes ticket tracking:
    Django. Ten minutes
    
    lskalt's IRC card bot:
    Man, but maintaining the socket connection while simultaneously syncing two users together is surprisingly hard. File locks are in order. Still need to figure out command system, and develop the class for the unique deck. What a fucked up game.
    
    silent_p's random image generator:
    ~~Generating a random image isn't hard
    
    kenkopin's amazing idea:
    Sweet motherfucker I'm so down for this. I think I have the reg keys here:
    
    Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
        
        &gt;  Value: Hidden (hidden file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value: HideFileExt !(Show exts)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 0 = Show
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value:  ShowSuperHidden (OS file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value:  ShowSuperHidden (OS file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value: SuperHidden (Toggle for superhidden attr.)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Enable
        


    
    So the key is backing up the  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\, 1, 0), initializing a non-intrusive reg restore on startup from the backed-up reg file (probably do a full reg-back too, jic), deleting the built python binaries from that startup file, and keeping those reg backups in a hidden folder.

1318906195.0,lfvkj,"[MOD] Hey /r/favor-ites, your mod team has re-written the rules, and now's your chance to chip in before we finalize them.  ",Anomander,67,26, as well as an exploration of proposed changes.

The rules that govern /r/favors have been in place for over a year. We feel it is time to revisit these rules in the interest of better serving our community. The current rules value the health of /r/favors first

**You, nor will any potential changes be more or less likely to be implemented based on upvotes or downvotes. The modship of /r/favors was elected by popular vote with the mandate to operate it in the common interest. We will entertain persuasive arguments but will not take any suggestion into consideration based purely on its point total.

**How we moderate /r/favors**

The overwhelming majority of the work performed by the /r/favors mods involves interacting with the filter. More often than not, the moderation team is not always going to remove a post, particularly if it has points and comments, but this is not a guarantee of immunity for popular but rule-breaking posts. *We recognize that this is a less-than-ideal system* but we also recognize that Reddit offers a less-than-ideal architecture for dealing with the problem. Realistically speaking, it's the best we can do.

A post is judged on many criteria. These criteria are different for requests and offers. Offers are granted more latitude - someone offering to draw something, it gets through. While holding relatively strict criteria to people who want things seems reasonable to prevent abuse, we have no reason to prevent someone from giving something away. *Posts that are looking for trades or sales are held to the [REQUEST] standards, because the recipient is asked to risk something of their own*.

**Requests are judged by the following criteria:**    

 * **Is it financial?** The community has repeatedly asked that we keep all ""panhandling"" requests out, donations, ""good causes"" and any and all ""a-thons."" Our readership enjoys being generous, but loathes assessing whether someone is worthy of their generosity - therefore, that task falls to the moderators. As we have the exact same tools to judge trustworthiness as you do, we refuse to do so. *Since we can't judge who is ""worthy"" and who is not, we do not judge at all*.    
 * **Is it art?** The community has repeatedly chosen to disallow all forms of ""please draw me a thing."" This extends to logos, picture coloring and design services of any kind. We permitted requests such as this for a weekend over a year ago and within 72 hours ""draw me a thing"" requests dominated the front page. We serve the community - and while the thing you want drawn is of keen interest to you, it is of near-zero interest to the community.    
 * **Is it voting?** /r/favors is not interested in rigging contests, adding followers, or any sort of attention exchange to be a ""favor"" per se.    
 * **Is it a referral?** Referrals
 * **Is the title honest?** A good example of a dishonest post is one titled ""[OFFER] Free Webdesign\*"" with ""\*if you sign up for my hosting service"" in the body. Posts that suggest one thing in the title and something else entirely in the content are removed. We contact the OP in marginal cases and suggest they try again with greater clarity.    

 * **Obvious ""joke"" posts get removed.** ""[REQUEST]: Harem, at least led to some really amusing conversations. 
* **Posts not containing a concrete favor or offer get pulled.** ""[Request] I has a sad, here's my steam ID""). 
 * **We also judge posts by the account posting them.** /r/favors exists as a place for redditors to do and ask for awesome stuff from each other. We require a clear demonstration that an account is a redditor first

 **Exemptions are never granted.** We're not judging you as a poster

**Changes we'd like to propose**  

 * **No ""buy me a NEW game"" requests.** Reddit has /r/gameswap, however, the ""new"" aspect of this request: Moderator Anomander has given away CD keys to most of his old, now unplayed, games here to folks requesting them. We propose that only games over four years old are legit to request, because the long-average update/expansion cycle is three years long. A four-year-old game is more likely to be sitting unplayed somewhere than Minecraft is.    
 * **Prices offered in trades/work for hire arrangments must be in the title.** ""Am willing to pay"" seems to have become ""I'll pay if you ask
 * **No ditch-digging?** Requests for others to perform tasks that require no skill, you're looking for free labor. This includes vectorization of images, etc.    

**Changes we are willing to implement:** Anything suggested below, individual redditors third. Further, /r/favors is a representative democracy: you elected us as moderators to perform the tasks and enact the changes we feel are essential to its management. If you have ideas that are not implemented, we invite you to run for election when nominations open next.

  Sincerely
Anomander, TheDashingPrince, Steve93, PanickedThumb (moderators, /r/favors, 2011)

I like the shows on channels such as Discovery, build and improve new, cool stuff.  I often end up wishing so much that I could have been like them.

Sometimes when I am really sad

I have a private mail box at one of those mailbox store places.  Maybe PM me for my physical address... or ask me for my email address if you have something nice that can be sent by email.

Im going to prune some info out of here that is no longer necessary.
Im trying to get him to send me something here so you all can see he was found. Will update in/when he does.

I also have offered to give the 'finder' a 'reward' for finding him.
Im not going to post the 'finders' name unless they want me to.

Anyhow, i hope.


I originally posted this in Reddit Detectives but that subreddit is more or less dead and was told this might be the next best place to try

So

Now, although my memory is hazy, that i called that house 5 years ago or so and concluded it was not him. Although, not sure on his middle name so i cant be sure the one i found online is the same one. 

 Anyhow, but they don't.

A Facebook page would even be better.

Anyhow

Last i visited him he lived in Elyria Ohio. This was way back in the day. Im guessing maybe 1995 or so.

I went to school with him at Linwood Middle School, at least in NJ. If he did it would of been North Brunswick Township High, NJ. But I don't think he did, or if he did, certainly only his freshman year.

His Grandfather was/is B Kane.

His father owned some business (CPA?) on Livingston ave in New Brunswick NJ. Again

He should be around my age. Im pretty sure he was the class after me (i was in 8th

He was married at least once.

Anyhow

(deleted out story)

I assumed he would contact me at some point. He never did.

I really think the guy is dead. I don't see why he would avoid me even if he was ashamed of what he did. Unless maybe he lost my contact info but with Facebook and Myspace coming into the scene in the past years its not all that hard to find me.

And if for some weird reason someone knows the guy

Oh

Anyhow

*edit :If this doesn't pan out that someone can help me here


More info: i was hesitant to talk about his Grandfather but it does have names. so...

[His Grandfather](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1024.html): He is survived by his wife, Deborah Majeski of New Jersey; a sister, Doris Atlas of New York; a grandson, Matthew Alderman, and, of course, Batman, the Joker

As you can see his Grandfather was the creator of Batman. I got to talk to the guy. A highlight of my life. He asked me if i thought Dick Tracy would do well in the theater. This was right after the 1st batman with Keaton was released. He seemed concerned it would do better than Batman. He then sent me a hand drawn pic of Batman and Robin.

I'm going to get working on some resumes.  I've got this great one about


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ORIGINAL POST:  I posted my resume (http://imgur.com/a/xjsPI#HPabm) in a thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f5gcl/iama_person_who_has_hired_a_lot_of_people_if_you/) and everyone was very kind about my resume.  

It was a huge boost to my self esteem and I'm proud to say that 24 hours after making this resume

I am offering to do somebody else's resume as a token of gratitude to Reddit.  Originally

I'm dedicating Saturday (tomorrow) to resumes.


EDIT 1:  Good Morning Reddit!  It's 9:06AM on an overcast Saturday morning here in lovely Melbourne Australia!  I literally JUST woke up and am lying naked in bed with my laptop.  Upon opening Reddit today I found that I had ten times the karma that I had last night and was terrified that this post had gone frontpage.  fortunately

So here's the problem:  I obviously can't do every body's resume.  I'm not even sure I can do all the resumes that really need it (dude who wrote me because he loves his DAD and wants to help him get a job and his life back...  yeah. um  I think I got something in my eye).

So there's going to have to be a way to select the winner's of my favour.  

Or....   

OR!   

Or there's going to have to be a lot more of me's.  Does anybody know of a community of designers on Reddit that might be feeling generous?  Designers dislike doing free work (we get asked to do it A LOT) but maybe today can be a fun day of designing resumes.  We should also ask copywriters to get in on this.  And proof readers!  

SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO:  I'm going to shower, some black liquorice gum and some munchies.  I'm going to come back here and pick a resume to start working on.  I'm swamped with orangereds so I think I'll make a gmail account to talk to the people I am helping.  DO NOT SEND YOUR EMAIL'S TO MY ACTUAL GMAIL PLEASE.  I've still got interview requests coming in there and I don't need a ton of traffic.

I love you all and I'll see you in a little bit.  It's going to be a great day,False,,t5_2re6a,True,,,t3_f6eyb

1306341050.0,hjw0f,[request] Wheelchair accessible van for father's day weekend (NY/LI Area),JaneBriefcase,50,3,20,"Hey Reddit

My dad's family has a yearly reunion on Father's day weekend that's not too far from where we live on Long Island. I'm trying to work out a way to get him there to see our family.  He's been able to get into our car for previous events but this past winter has been really hard on him (he has PPMS - Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis) and he can no longer get into/out of a smaller car or transfer in and out of a scooter.   Since this might be the last year that he can get out for any extended period of time

I know there's an option to rent vans--we've done that in the past--but we just can't afford it this year. My fiance and I had my dad move in with us a couple years ago and the one apartment rental we found that could fit his chair and allow him to live a semi-normal life eats a good portion of our monthly income. We did try a while back to save for a van and give my dad a little semblance of freedom but something always comes up and drains the ability right out of savings (woo timing belt!). We really are only able to get him out of the house for an event like this once or maybe twice per year and last time we got him into our car it came with great physical exhaustion (for him).

I would be willing to provide delicious baked goods and my eternal gratitude as well as proof of insurance and a clean driving record. I'm also no stranger to physical labor and would be willing to do almost anything--like scanning all of your old family photos or painting that back room you just can't get to...anything.  

Some details of the proposed trip: It's not that long of a drive (~40 minutes) and I have experience driving large RVs

So

Please, can you fly it by me? A bad survey makes all collected data meaningless.

Think about it. In exchange

-----------------

**Top 5 Mistakes Made in Surveys**

1. Unclear meanings
&gt;* **You** know what it means. Will everyone else know what it means? Probably not!
&gt; * Ask yourself, just head over to youtube.com and look at a few comments.
&gt; * This includes: poor lead-in (the sentences before your actual question)
2. Non-exhaustive answer choices
&gt; * e.g. ""0-10,000; 16,000-20,000"". Leaves out 10,500
&gt; * versus ""0-10,000; 15,000-20,000"". This has 10,000 and 15,000 twice. I wouldn't know which one to check!
&gt; * or ""male
&gt; * This also includes assuming that everyone engages in some kind of task or buys some certain item. **Don't ever assume anything!** Because you *will* get the bisexual transgender Austrian from Madagascar who's never been on the internet before taking the survey.
3. Poor design/layout
&gt; * People read from top to bottom. If your definitions are below the answer boxes
&gt; * Are the divisions between questions clear?
&gt; * Is it clear where they're supposed to answer and how?
4. Questions don't match answers
&gt; * e.g. ""How often?"" when answers are ""5
&gt; * This may include: insufficient units
&gt; * Try to answer every question with each possible answer to it - does it makes sense? Is that how you could see yourself answering that question?
&gt; * **Always** explain how your scale works. ""On a scale of 1-10"" isn't enough! Sometimes 1 is best
&gt; * On the same note
5. Trying to keep it short at the expense of clarity
&gt; * What does ""male or female?"" or ""sex?"" mean? Just say it: ""What is your gender?"" People will be angrier the more time they spend wondering what you're asking

1261244089.0,agj8q,The OFFICIAL r/Favors FAQ,kleinbl00,56,10,19,"Hi there.  It'd be neat if you had some familiarity with this brief bit o'text prior to posting in /r/Favors.  Right now, healthy place it looks like it should be.

**1) What's a ""favor?""**

 - [The Oracle](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Afavor&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) defines a favor as ""an act of gracious kindness.""  /r/Favors

**2) What other resources are there to ask for or grant a favor?**

 - Well, we'll ban it.  There's Freecycle, too, for those of you more interested in altruism.  If it's ""stuff"" you seek, Craigslist or Freecycle are the way to go.

**3) That's not a favor

 - [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelp) average-sized subreddit.  Yeah

**4) What about relationship advice?**

- [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/) Four times the eyeballs

**5) Could you listen to my song...?**

 - Sure

**6)...critique my poetry...?**

 - Again

**7)...send me letters/emails/IMs/smoke signals?**

 - Yes

**8) So you're just trying to drive everyone away.  Got it.**

 - Hardly!  Consider this just another favor - you're likely to get the best response from a group of people focused on freecycling/relationship advice/music making/whatever.  If you look

**9) Whatever.  So why has my post about composing petrarchan sonnets been banned?  Huh?  Riddle me that

 - It hasn't.  Some posts go to purgatory where they sit for a couple hours.  Then they automagically emerge, I promise, just be patient.  *No Patience?*  See over there on the right, where it says ""MODERATORS"" and has three names?  Read a little further - see that `""message the moderators""`in little tiny text?  **CLICK ON THAT.**  Vwa.

**10) Well

 - Damn skippy.  Torrent request swaps go in the **Official Invite Swap Thread, however, I didn't ban you - I just refused to rescue your post from purgatory.  Post in the official thread like everyone else. **Bear in mind that most private trackers frown on giving out invites to people you don't know.**  If they ban you for what you do on here, don't cry to me about it.  Your argument is with THEIR terms of service, not mine.

**11) I hate your color scheme.**

 - And I hate your shoes.  Way to be passive-aggressive.

**12) Why are you talking to yourself?**

 - I ask myself that every day.

1319410754.0,lmgtz,"[MOD] /r/Favors' Official Rules, October 23, 2011",Anomander,63,25, the health of the Reddit community second and the satisfaction of the individual redder third. Any changes to these rules will reflect these same core values. The modship of /r/favors was elected by popular vote with the mandate to operate it in the common interest. 

**How we moderate /r/favors**

The overwhelming majority of the work performed by the /r/favors mods involves interacting with the filter. More often than not, the moderation team is not always going to remove a post, particularly if it has points and comments, but this is not a guarantee of immunity for popular but rule-breaking posts. *We recognize that this is a less-than-ideal system* but we also recognize that Reddit offers a less-than-ideal architecture for dealing with the problem. Realistically speaking, it's the best we can do.  If you are curious why we do not set rules and allow user voting to care for the health of the frontpage, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lfvkj/mod_hey_rfavorites_your_mod_team_has_rewritten/c2sduse) is a lengthy and detailed explanation using art requests as a specific example.  

A post is judged on many criteria. These criteria are different for requests and offers. Offers are granted more latitude - someone offering to draw something, it gets through. While holding relatively strict criteria to people who want things seems reasonable to prevent abuse, we have no reason to prevent someone from giving something away. *Posts that are looking for trades or sales are held to the [REQUEST] standards, because the recipient is asked to risk something of their own*.

**Please tag posts appropriately.**  The team doesn't necessarily ban un-tagged posts

**Requests are judged by the following criteria:**    

 * **No financial requests.** The community has repeatedly asked that we keep all ""panhandling"" requests out, donations, ""good causes"" and any and all ""a-thons."" Our readership enjoys being generous, but loathes assessing whether someone is worthy of their generosity - therefore, that task falls to the moderators. As we have the exact same tools to judge trustworthiness as you do, we refuse to do so. *Since we can't judge who is ""worthy"" and who is not, we do not judge at all*.  This rule includes requests for gifts, knick-knacks
 * **We do not do custom art or design work on request.** The community has repeatedly chosen to disallow all forms of ""please draw me a thing."" This extends to logos, picture coloring, video editing, and design services of any kind. We recommend [/r/picrequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests) instead.  The team permitted requests such as this for a weekend over a year ago and within 72 hours ""draw me a thing"" requests dominated the front page. We serve the community - and while the thing you want drawn is of keen interest to you, it is of near-zero interest to the community.  This does not exclude offers of custom art of design, and the /r/favors community strongly encourages such posts.  Logos for *thriving* reddit communities are the only art request not banned under this rule.    
 * **We do not pad your numbers.** /r/favors is not interested in rigging contests, adding followers, Facebook ""likes,"" Google+ ""+1""s, or any sort of attention exchange to be a ""favor"" per se.

1364243803.0,1azuqr,[offer] Will build a free responsive website for your restaurant.,Hannachomp,51,8,7,"**About me:**
 
*Design:* I'm a graphic designer in my final semester at a design school. Last summer, feel free to pm me.

*Coding:* I self taught myself html/css about 7 years ago. I can add limited javascript to the website. If you want something a little more fancy

*Illustration:* I also have a background in illustration. So if you wanted a more illustrative website


**Why I'm offering this for free:** 

For the last half of this semester one of my projects is to create a responsive website for a restaurant. I figured I might as well see if anyone wants to work with me to create a real one. That way I can both help someone who needs a website and create something that lives in the real world.

**Who you should be:** 

Someone who owns a small restaurant. 

You can have a website already or have none at all. 

In the next few months you weren't already planning on contacting someone for a new website or any website in general or you were just planning on letting your sister's high school kid who knows some html to make it. *I don't want this job to take away from another designer.*

You aren't in a hurry. This will be probably be done in early May.

Willing to keep in contact with me. So I can create something that will work with both of us. 

Own some sort of digital camera or knows someone with a camera or have nice large photographs I can use for the website.

**What this will be:**

A website that will be responsive restaurant website. It'll be simple and up to par with many websites already out there: with history about me/landing page/menu/location etc. I will not implement an online ordering system. This will be built completely from scratch. It will not be template based

I can help you get a domain name and such if you need me to and help implement it. Or I can just give you all the files for you to do it yourself. I will help you change small things on the website in the beginning until you get use to it. I will not completely revamp the website later.

If you do not have any branding (logos/colours/etc) we can work together to build something simple. However, if you didn't have any branding, I will help you change it later after my original placeholder brand.

If you do not keep in contact with me I'll still move on with the project. If you do not provide me with photos I will just use stock images. If you do not provide me with examples of what you're expecting

If the finished product is not up to your satisfaction you do not need to actually use the website. However

The design and development will be completely free. I will *not* put ""Made by Hannachomp"" or something similar on the site. I do not expect anything from you except constant feedback and information and you can later use the website as you wish. 

The only thing I will be doing is linking to your site from my portfolio.

I will not pay for your domain and hosting.

I'm only making one site. It won't be a first come first serve basis. I want to work with someone who will be able to work with me.

What I’m proposing is that somebody let me shadow them at their place of work for a day. I’ll expect no compensation; the experience will be my reward. If you build houses for a living, honest work so if your profession requires a rake or shovel I’d be more than happy to pitch in.

Somebody is going to say: “why don’t you just volunteer for a day?” I love volunteer work but what I’m looking for is something entirely different. Maybe it’ll inspire me to seek a new career. Maybe it will give me some insight into what’s involved in other professions. I’m sure I’ll gain new respect for whatever it is I end up doing.

In return, sorting through materials our guys require, pricing those materials out and purchasing them. That’s it. Well that and a bunch of other stuff. If that sounds exciting to you, I’m sorry. Still, you’d be more than welcome to spend a day with me. I’m sure you'll walk away having learned something.

I’m serious. This is something I’d really like to do. Maybe there are others who might be interested in trying this out as well. Even if it doesn’t pan out for me I’d love to hear if it worked out for somebody else. Consider it something like a “Bring a Redditor to Work Day”. If this post goes nowhere I'll try reposting early next week.

**tl;dr:** I’d like to shadow somebody at their place of work for a day and offer them the same opportunity in return. I’m just looking for some new experiences and a way to break the monotony of my day-to-day life.

Also also note that resizing the pictures is usually inevitable, resize it to ~512x512 so that it looks good to you before submitting; however, I can usually take care of that.

I get at least a few calls a week while I'm at work saying she pressed the button because she fell, or couldn't get out of bed. I've also noticed this problem has hit her thinking ability as well, I'm losing my mother very slowly. But it's not even me I'm worried about

So what I'm turning to Reddit for is, is always talking about him, and watching his series ""Person of Interest"". One of her friends who is a good artist even painted an oil painting of him that she has in her room. I'm wondering if you guys could help me perhaps get in contact with Jim somehow, and maybe have him sign something for her, or even write her a short letter somehow.

I own and run [VlexoFree](http://vlexofree.com). Its a free web hosting service that has two plans to choose from. *Personal 300* which offers 300MB of space and 5GB of bandwidth; this plan is usually for small personal sites/projects. And *Expert 2000* which offers 2GB of space and 20GB of bandwidth; a nice plan for big or business sites.

The server currently supports:

* [PHP 5.2](http://vlexofree.com/info.php) (I like the keep this up to date but 5.3 gives the server problems ATM)
* MySQL 5.1 (with MySQLi)
* PostgreSQL
* Python
* Perl
* CGI
* Ruby on Rails

Sadly theres a requirement for both the plans (sorry!). For the Personal 300 plan I require a linkback on all displayed pages. For the Expert 2000 plan I require the same as the personal plan plus an ad. Nothing is forced on your pages and you can choose where you want to put everything. If you're wondering why I do this

As requested by a current member of my site there is an ad-free plan for $5/month if you want it (SSH if you ask for it with this plan too).

I'm a very transparent person so if you're wondering what I get from VlexoFree here it is. I make about $6 a month from co.cc referrals

I think thats everything you need to know.. Feel free to sign up.

Note: I don't run VlexoFree for profit (can you even have profit for free hosting?); I run it to give people who don't have money the opportunity to have a website.

1268425273.0,bcog4,[Request] Someone loan me four grand for a period of one month?,Mr_E,66,29,60,"I'm sure this requires explanation, and to be with him in what we imagined would be his last couple years. He passed in late august of 2008.

I'm currently a student, I'm between jobs with a prospect for working with UVA, I'm in school which I'm paying for with copious loans, and can barely afford to support myself and the wife. She recently posted an AMA about writing papers, and reddit has been kind with more than a few requests.
My dad, who I'm currently living with, sadly, has lost her god damn mind and declared bankruptcy on the majority of bills my father left her with. She decided she required said land, and sold it to other family we have, and has pretty much squandered all of it on bullshit. The remainder is 4 grand which should arrive here in a month, and it's mine

Here's the issue. My mother is insane (a story for another time), and so I've taken it upon myself to speak with said family. The money is being pulled together, but I'm in need of it now as I've found a small studio apartment in the country for ridiculously modest rent (350 instead of ~600) as well as a couple cars that fit my price range. I currently need a car to actually take the jobs that I've gotten offers for, but said mother has pretty much sucked the family dry of any money and asking anyone else for a loan is impossible because of this. She lives off of disability, and cash from her father, in a house my grandmother owns, and respects absolutely nothing.
I'm sure a lot of you still aren't compelled to open your wallets for me. Thats fine. I'm not a Haiti victim, a job, and out on my own again.

TL;DR I need a loan of 4, in full, in exactly 1 month. I am not asking for donations. There are far more needy people out there. I just need a loan and feel thats already a considerable request.

I'd rather they not go to waste since most people enjoy flipping through them, PM me your address and I'll mail them.  Like I say I have about 30 or 40 left, first come first serve.  However, I will prioritize anyone who thinks they can put one of these into the right hands, or can get me more exposure than sitting on a coffee table.

 - *The spam filter for /r/Favors is legandarily aggressive  because  asking for favors tends to stink of Internet scammer-hood.  Don't be dissuaded; we spend a fair amount of time picking posts off its teeth.  If you don't see your post show up within an hour or so

**What's a ""favor?""**

 - [The Oracle](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Afavor&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) defines a favor as ""an act of gracious kindness.""  /r/Favors, non-monetary assistance, either asked or offered, between peers.**""     What you're looking for might be better handled elsewhere, as listed here and as listed in the sidebar.

**What other resources are there to ask for or grant a favor?**

 - Well, we'll ban it.  There's Freecycle, too, for those of you more interested in altruism.  If it's ""stuff"" you seek, Craigslist or Freecycle are the way to go.

**I want to give/get help with my/your homework!**

 - [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelp) average-sized subreddit.  Yeah

**Could you listen to my song...?**

 - Sure

**...critique my poetry...?**

 - Again

**...proofread my resume/letter of intent/novel/grocery list/manifesto...?**

 - Again

**...send me letters/emails/IMs/smoke signals?**

 - Yes

**Draw me a picture of [x] riding/fucking/serenading/flaying a [y]?**

 - No.  Requests for drawings will be banned.  *Offers for drawings will be upvoted.*  There's nothing you need so badly you can't wait a few days for someone to offer to draw you anything.  If there is

**Respond to my survey?**

 - Probably.  The general mood of the subreddit can best be gaged [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bn977/request_discussion_about_click_me_fill_out_my/)  Also keep in mind [/r/SurveyJerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/SurveyJerk/ ""which is small

**Pay my rent/keep my heat on/buy my [Z] on eBay so I can afford gas money?**

 - ...yeah, actually, this was just the latest"") and when we let requests such as these through, they tend to degrade the discussion in the entire subreddit.  *So no, we're not going to let you ask in /r/Favors.*  Great news, though!  ***[/r/Assistance is just the place you need!](/r/Assistance)***


**So you're just trying to drive everyone away.  Got it.**

 - Hardly!  Consider this just another favor - you're likely to get the best response from a group of people focused on freecycling/relationship advice/music making/whatever.  If you look

**Whatever.  So why has my post about composing petrarchan sonnets in response to LOLcats pix been banned?  Huh?  Riddle me that

 - Because lotsa stuff gets banned by the filter.  We'll get to it when we clean out the ModQ, just be patient.  *No Patience?*  See over there on the right, where it says ""MODERATORS"" and has three names?  Read a little further - see that `""message the moderators""`in little tiny text?  **CLICK ON THAT.**  Vwa.

**But this post or that post or the other post is totally NOT what I consider to be a favor!  In fact

 - Then please *REPORT IT.*  Reported links and posts show up in the mod queue, at the very least, consider your opinion.

**Well

 - Damn skippy.  Torrent request swaps go in [**r/Trackers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers) plainly visible in the sidebar and elsewhere in this wall'o'text. 

**And what about my Dropbox/Google Voice/Starcraft 2/whatever request?**

 - If it's a serial, or anything else related to software and referrals, it goes in [**The Invite Thread.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bw9bl/the_official_rfavors_invite_swap_thread_now/)

It's time for more changes to how /r/favors goes.

After a two-year run with Klein's experimental model of democratic moderation

Why?

Because as much as it saddens me to say it

Two and a half years on, mail, and picks up the slack as needed. (Thank you guys. Seriously. &lt;3)

No rancor towards the removed or past team members

Holding elections did not find us more qualified mods than we might've found by more organic means

Sadly, our community, and the relationship between those two and the mod team. We want the mod team to be the best to this community and for this community that we can make it, and we don't feel that re-training a new team once or twice a year is the best way to do that - but if there's no changeover in elections, there's no point in holding them.

So where to from here?

We are going to return to a more aggressively policed mod list, with folks chosen for our belief in their work ethic, their familiarity with the /r/favors community and its values, and their ability to mesh well with the existing team.

As a result

We're pleased to welcome /u/zomboi to the team, r/seattle and r/gossip under his belt, and is looking to expand his responsibilities and contributions to the larger Reddit community. He is someone Kleinbl00 is familiar with and vouches for - which is enough for me and hopefully for the /r/favors community as well.

And, and I've always felt he and his vision for this community are what drive us to be the place we are - it hasn't felt quite right since he stepped back. I'm very excited to get him back openly and publicly participating in the community and it's continued growth and development.

So, and will have a fantastic New Year, and hope that you will continue to stick around and be the true lifeblood of this community. We the team will endeavor to be available within this thread for any questions or feedback you may have, and as ever, don't hesitate to message the mod team or PM individual mods as you feel necessary.

I don't regret any of it &amp; I know each person really appreciated it, but I can't keep doing this.

If you know anyone that is looking and is trustworthy, please contact me for more information. I'll have pictures when my mom sends them over.
The pets are as follows: Pet Type: Cat Name: Smokey Breed: Tabby Age: Unknown (Adult &gt;4 years) Sex: Male Weight: 20lbs +/- Coloring: Short hair, and healthy. He's an indoor/outdoor cat. He is good with my mom's dog and other cats.
Pet Type: Cat Name: Kitty (I know it's not great) Breed: Calico Age: Unknown (Adult &gt;4 years) Sex: Female Weight: 13lbs +/- Coloring: Long hair, white Temperament: Caring, somewhat skittish Note: Taken in by my mom from another home. Tends to latch on to a single person, relatively low maintenance, tolerates cats and dogs without issues
This pet is a tentative listing (she's trying everything she can to keep at least one and she chose the puppy) Pet Type: Dog Name: Sydney Breed: Australian Sheep Dog Age: Unknown (Adult &gt;4 years) Sex: Female Weight: 20lbs +/- Coloring: Long hair, white, white/blue eyes Temperament: Caring, lapdog, very sweet and happy Note: Good with pretty much everyone, not sure about small children. She is a house dog that goes outside to go to the bathroom. She loves going for a ride in the car too. I'm fuzzy on the details, but she used to live on a large ranch-like property with other larger dogs and that apparently wasn't going well.

She was a stay at home wife who didn't work and signed the married filing jointly paperwork that he never sent in (although he told her he did).

Please help a fellow Redditor out with a server to SSH tunnel through!",renzacari,33,2,28,"I've ended up volunteering at a school in a somewhat remote part of China until May next year. This is a good thing and a cool experience.

Sadly.. I've also discovered how bad the Great Firewall of China is. I have trouble going to many web sites including ones we consider pretty basic in the U.S like Facebook. It's hard to keep in touch with friends and family without it.

Granted I'm not one of those people who 'can't survive' without Facebook. :) If only it were Facebook though then it would be fine. But I'm finding that it's literally thousands perhaps millions of sites that are blocked.

I found that with my old web host (I had a few blogs) that I could SSH tunnel with my web hosting account. I guess I was lucky though because I found out that most web hosts don't even allow this 'feature'. I tried contacting HostGator and some other web hosts to inquire about SSH tunneling if I were to set-up an account. They all said NO.

There are VPN services which charge a foot and a leg per month. Really though and to be completely honest I just want to be able to access a few blocked web sites. I promise not to do anything traffic intensive or anything illegal.
My goal is to access the web sites that I'm used to (like Facebook) without having to use a web proxy with pop-ups going all over the place.

Yes.. I know about Hotspot Shield.. but I find their pop-ups and spam impossible to block even with AdBlock enabled on Chrome. Note: I don't use AdBlock for Reddit. I love this site and read it everyday.

So I promise not to do anything bad. I just want to get back to normal online life and keep in touch with my friends back in the states. Please send me a message if you have a web server in the U.S and can help. Cheers!

1271491419.0,bs7bb,[Request] Can anybody help a struggling person out?,clairmontster,54,23,57,"WALL OF TEXT:  TL;DR: Received help from redditors


I'm a very poor student with no parental support.  I started school a few years late because of neither parent qualifying as cosigners for my loans and none of my cousins

I had a sharp pain in my side back in february so severe that it forced an ER visit.  Turned out to be peritonitis and they stopped it before I had to get surgery, went on with life.  I then developed really serious pains in early march and went to the ER again.  The difference between the visits: no insurance the second time.  I couldn't afford to pay 800 bucks to renew it for a year at the time.  Also, it wasn't peritonitis the second time, it was pancreatitis.  Topping the cake was that my kidneys, bladder, stomach and urinary tract were infected.  I knew it would be beyond expensive, but there's nothing I can do about that.  I barely have 20 bucks to my name at any given time and cannot even pay my regular bills when they are due; so I figured that it would be alright to tack on another reason to lose sleep every night.

My school schedule keeps me from being able to have any job of substance.  I'm taking 20 credits this semester, which then turns around into another class at 7PM.  Tuesdays and thursdays, I have a class at 10 AM, noon, 2pm and 6pm.  No employer that is hiring is willing to flex their hours to meet my schedule.  

To make money

I'm behind two months on rent (1050 total) and can't afford next week's march electric bill deadline (90 bucks).  I cut my internet and cell phone off in february since I could not forsee myself paying for them (a friend decided to pay for a prepaid phone for me, desktop, furniture and a large amount of clothes to supplement my bills.  I have nothing left to get rid of to make a quick desperation buck; all I own now is my cheap 60 dollar laptop, a set of clothes, a school bag and my pillow.  My student loans' fine print has forced me to start paying them back which is sapping another 220 a month.  Finally, my ER bill from march came in today.  I owe 5322.60.  Now that 800 for insurance doesn't seem so bad, but doesn't change the fact that I couldn't/can't afford it.

If I give up eight credits and drop to 12 (the bare minimum for full time), but it's nearly the end of the semester and I'm banking on a 4.0 which will set my cum. GPA to 3.5, which is required by my major for graduating.

I don't know what to ask for, it's three pounds of peas, but they will run out.  Second, can anybody help me find a way to knock out that 5322.60 medical bill?  I can probably work something out with my landlord to keep getting kicked out, and can probably set up a payment plan with my power company to keep the lights on another day, but there's nothing I know of that I can do to make that 5000 change to something easier to swallow.

without doubt fed time is better. we don't call it club-fed for nothing, softball field, pool tables, lot's of tv rooms with cable and 42"" tv's. this place is pretty laid back, compared to some of the units i was in at state prison.

look

-Locked up
-Gangland
-Scared Straight
and any of the other stupid ass reality shows.... prison is nowhere near none of that shit. people don't stab you or try to rape you for no fucking reason. i was in state, not realizing they're not out in the freeworld.

your jokes were funny, they think they're out there in their own home and they won't even ask they'll just change the channel! you can't beat them up though cuz they already have one foot in the grave.




--------------


i have hundreds of prison stories dude

some of the funniest things i've heard around this place include gems like these:

-""fuck! i forgot my loofa!"" (heard in the shower)

-""i'm almost done with my quilt

-""this is not the right shade of pink

-""out in the freeworld i owned both a mercedes and a benz"" ""isn't that the same thing?"" ""NO IT ISN'T YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW"" (stupid black people talking)

-""i think my wife is cheating on me"" ""why do you say that?"" ""i called the house and my kid said: mommy my other daddy is calling"" (at the phone center)

-""you think this is kosher?"" (porkchops for dinner

this week we're watching that Alex Cross movie
ever since i came here i've developed some guilty pleasures...i secretly grab my celli's mp3 and listen to all his pop music while i read vampire novels designed for 16 yr old girls.  i need to get out!

tell your sister that she needs to read the Vampire Academy novels, but tell her not to even read the back of the book cuz it gives a lot away. i liked these more than i liked the Twilight ones.

Law is by far



-----
there is no limit to the amount of pictures i can get...i can only get them in batches of 25 per envelope. otherwise they get sent back. no frontal nudity, Hustler or penthouse type publications :( if you do send me a magazine, send me the WWE magazine....no one gets that mag here. and you should start watching it again. The Rock is WWE champ and Cena is gonna fight him for the title on Wrestlemania, CM Punk pulled a bitch move and gets to fight the Undertaker. he thinks he can beat the undertaker's 20-0 streak at wrestlemania. my favorite wrestler right now is Ryback, i want to get that big O_O

i get the money in my books and i can go to store and buy shit, ke$ha and taylor swift in my head. the mp3 is 75 bucks, and each song is a either .85 cents to 1.05 depending on popularity i guess. they sell other stuff on the store, food, clothing items and shit like that.

Those will be mailed out individually.

**Placement instructions **  
===========
please read this before attempting to place your sticker

* Surface: The surface must be smooth, glass. The stickers  will stick to porous materials, but not as well  .
* The temperature of the surface is important: it needs to be at least room temperature. anything colder will significantly reduce the sticking power of the adhesive.  
* Cleaning is important. Clean twice with windex , if possible, once more with rubbing alcohol to remove all residues.   
* Peel back the backing (the opaque sheet). The sticker should remain
* place your sticker flatly
* using a credit card or equivalent
* grab one of the corner from the transfer paper
* If some of the sticker peels off with the transfer paper, and try lifting from a different angle.   
* If you have a big surface

Hi! About 11 days ago ago I asked redditors from a number of subreddits (e.g., 91 responses are not enough to generate adequate statistical power for the statistical tests that I am using. As such, I'm hoping that I can collect more responses today to reach my goal of at least 200 responses. 

The following is an edited version of my original post that includes important information to consider prior to participating in the study:

Hi! I'm currently collecting data to use primarily to complete my dissertation, how old are you? No information that could be used to identify any person will be collected.

In accordance with my university's procedures concerning the ethical treatment of human subjects

Not a favorite was stirring

The requests were hung by the new queue with care

In hopes that some upvoter soon would be there;

The posters were nestled all snug at their desks

While visions of Christmas cards danced in their asks;

It's mods all up in /r/aww and /r/breaddit;

Had just settled down for a winter's reddit

When up in the Spam queue arose such a clatter

I checked the filter find out the matter.

Away to the spam queue I flew like a flash

Swung the banhammer

The mail requests well exceeded the snow

Did little but crush small posts far below

When

But a wonderful favorite

With a generous offer

I knew right then it must become the norm.

More precious than bacon

And he whistled

""No more requests! Only offers

""Now, sulky card seeker!

Come one, don't be a sneaker!

To the top of the page! to the top of /r/all!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
