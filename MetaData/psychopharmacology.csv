I have also suffered from depression for a number of years which is where my interest in this field stems from. 2 years ago I was placed on citalopram and stayed on the drug for approximately one year. The drug didn't really work for me and I actually found it a bit to stimulatory for my needs. So my GP prescribed me mirtazapine which was great at first but after about 6-7 months I felt the drug completely and utterly ""poop out"" on me. I felt it made me become utterly apathetic and anhedonic. I decided to withdraw and become drug free but I've never really felt that that the apathy and anhedonia has cleared up.
From my limited understanding and research I believe that the semi-long term use of these anti-depressants has caused some sort of dopamine down-regulation in my brain which happened during the tail end of my treatment with mirtazapine. I believe that this lack of dopamine may be causing my issues with apathy and anhedonia. 

I was just wondering whether there are any drugs available that are tailored to the treatment of apathy and anhedonia. I've researched a few drugs with dopaminergic agonistic action such as bupropion/wellbutrin but I'm a little bit tentative about chatting to my GP about being prescribed them as I understand that agonism of dopamine receptors can lead to psychotic like reactions in some patients. 

basically I believe I've made a lot of scientific assumptions above based on my limited knowledge of neurochemistry and I have a few questions if anyone has a spare moment 

1. Is it possible for long-term use of anti-depressants to cause some sort of reduction in the levels of dopamine in the brain?

2. Is a lack of dopamine thought to be one of the general causes of apathy and anhedonia?

3. Are there any medications known to be particularly useful in the treatment of apathy and anhedonia?

I appreciate the time taken for you to read this and perhaps help me out with my search for information.

It's been a while since I've seen any discussion or articles regarding the use of Ketamine to treat the depressive swing of Bipolar patients

Here are the sort of reports I have seen:

[Ketamine lifts mood quickly in bipolar disorder](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/03/us-ketamine-bipolar-idUSTRE6725J820100803)

[Ketamine is magic drug for depression](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7953967/Ketamine-is-magic-drug-for-depression.html)

Now before the discussion gets started

It's worth noting that most threads on Reddit about the anti-depressant features of Ketamine are flooded with people talking about the recreational side of the drug

If someone does happen to remember the thread and can find it

I'm Bipolar Type II and currently take Valproate Acid (Depakote) as treatment

I am interested in trying low dosage Ketamine to help combat my depression, to help me out in such a way. However as it's speculated that it's because Ketamine is an NMDA Receptor Antagonist that it has a mood-lifting effect, alternatively there are a couple of NMDA Antagonists that I can get a hold of.

Laughing Gas and DXM are both NMDA Receptor Antagonists like Ketamine

---

So my questions are:

Does anyone have experience with Ketamine and depression?

Does anyone have experience with Laughing Gas/DXM and depression?

Does anyone know if the different NMDA antagonists work in the same way

&gt; [Lithium modulates desensitization of the glutamate receptor

and particularly this snippet;

&gt; Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization. Specifically
aniracetam,
but has synergistic effects with lithium on wild-type receptors.


If you read further into the paper, and offer a open question on, is the ramifications of this synergism. The GluR3 receptor subunit itself is pretty mysterious, considering from what I gather, it's pretty hard to create ligands that differentiate with a high enough affinity to discern the result of modulation over a different subunit. From what I gather from a variety of sources, GluR3 affects/modulates seizures, anxiety, and resting respiration. ([Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18312590))

Taking what is generally accepted about lithium and aniracetam

* disrupts circadian rhythm regulation
* antidepressant
* anxiolytic
* neuroprotective

Source on ampakine traits [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1527-3458.2002.tb00216.x/abstract), I don't think a source is necessary for the rest. Disruption of natural circadian rhythm is generally correlated as being a positive effect on Bipolar Disorder by lithium, in case you were not familiar- and of course, just because the two share the same effects, does not mean they have the same mechanism of action.

Much of this could be considered extrapolation and guesswork- but I've been approved the combination of lithium and aniracetam by my PDOC and I am genuinely curious what underlying effects this might induce. I'm just using it to treat cognitive impairments from lithium

This is a long read but I believe it may be of some interest to those who are curious about the properties of serotonin synthesis.

I have BPD II (w/ Ultra Ultra Rapid Cycling) as well as ADHD and a host of other nasty mental conditions, ultra ultra rapid cycling is the actual clinical term for those who cycle from extreme moods from hour to hour. 

Lithium is the gold standard for preventing these mood swings, and the weekly blood tests aren't much fun either. You don't go on Lithium unless you absolutely have to. Being a drug nerd, I sought to study the pharmacology with my neuropsych doc, who is also a researcher in the field of neuroplasticity. She agrees that it is best to be informed of whatever you are imbibing. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_pharmacology) a brief rundown of the pharmacological properties of lithium for those unfamiliar.

Okay. Enough preface. [Lithium induces a notable increase in serotonin synthesis](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/178/2/325.short)- a property I believe only a handful of drugs share. Now, and B vitamins increase serotonin synthesis because they are the elements necessary to actually create serotonin- but Lithium actually increases the *rate* at which the serotonin is synthesized (for sourcing, check the above article). Because 5-HTP, etc. are simply the building blocks, how much they can help has an upper limit defined by how much your body still needs- therefore, you can't take a gram of 5-HTP and expect to cure treatment-resistant depression.

Again
&gt; The calculation indicated that lithium increased the synthesis rate of brain serotonin by about 80%. Moreover

Okay, an addition of 5-HTP is much more potent for people on lithium. Combine this with the fact that many people on psychotropic medications may not be taking in a healthy diet necessary to maintain a healthy mood, 5-HTP can be the difference in curing treatment resistant depression.

This combination has one pitfall- combination of 5-HTP and Lithium can induce serotonin syndrome due to excess concentrations of serotonin. However, patients seeking this sort of therapy must monitor their mood immediately after initiating treatment and cancel administration of 5-HTP if hypermanic symptoms occur.


This combination is most notable because unlike antidepressants

On a personal and unsourced note, and while I still have an occasional down day, I finally feel free to conduct my life without the constant fear of a sudden, unexplained drop in mood. I did have hypomania (mild mania) on the first couple days of treatment, but it disappeared fairly quickly and hasn't become a problem since.

**Most notably, mild euphoria**. It was much stronger at first but it has persisted without fail since initiation of treatment. It is much like the afterglow of a psychedelic or the upswing following prolonged steady SSRI treatment- a subtle sense of fulfillment and a perceptible, almost body-high. It feels natural and is not accompanied with any negative side effects, though my dreams have gotten quite interesting and I have constant closed-eyed visuals/ mild rainbow vision.

1347672147.0,zwnog,Is there any danger to mixing an anticholinergic (e.g. Benadryl or Dramamine) with a nootropic stack containing a choline supplement? (X-Post from /r/nootropics),IThrowShoes,20,5,2,"Greetings

I pieced together a few supplements to create a nootropic stack. This cocktail consists of piracetam

However, namely in the struggle between the choline supplement and the anticholinergic. I have never had an issue with either of the anticholinergics in the past, but I have never actually tried one in conjunction with a choline supplement. I don't plan on taking my stack with an anticholinergic every day, only on the rare occasions I need it.

Is this concern valid? Thanks in advance!

Here's where my research has led me:

&gt;[Ketamine] initially blocks a protein on brain neurons, it is not known if the drug’s rapid antidepressant effects are a direct result of this blockage or of downstream effects triggered by the blockage

(http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2012/nimh-03.htm)

So it seems that blocking NMDA is what helps alleviate depression.

&gt;S-(+)-ketamine has greater affinity than R-(−)-ketamine at phencyclidine binding sites on the NMDA receptor.

(http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/2/59.full)


So this means that s-isomer ketamine blocks NMDA more

Do any of you know of anything that would contradict this theory? Do any of you think that science may not yet truly know how this all works

Before I researched any of this, when you use s-isomer ketamine, it is more potent, so you need less, and maybe you need more of any kind of ketamine in your system for antidepressive efffects, and that could explain why he thought it was less antidepressive?

I'm focusing mainly on DAT (dopamine active transporter).
A bunch of sources, making it pump dopamine out of the cytosol back into the synapse. Most other articles that I found cite that same article and build off of it. I’m not arguing the validity of this claim. However, all the articles regarding this inversion treat it as the primary/only effect of AMPH on DAT. My book makes no mention of the following alternative.
The other mechanism of amphetamine on DAT I found is the transport of DAT from the membrane back into the cytosol (2) which, nor can it pump any dopamine from the cytosol out of the neuron. There’s a significant correlation (r = 0.75) between the movement of DAT into the cytosol and the inhibition of dopamine reuptake. There are fewer articles in support of this though one of them (3) offers photographic evidence. 
Both mechanisms together do a better job of explaining amphetamine’s effects on dopamine reuptake than either one individually.

So

Sidenote: I’m aware that amphetamine also affects other neurotransmitters in similar ways

I couldn't handle the side effects as it sent me into a state of psychosis of sorts and whenever I missed a dose by just an hour I would get these *horrible* brain zaps! 

I finally got to see a psychiatrist who took me off Effexor and to help with the discontinuation syndrome I was put on Prozac, just not as bad as coming off Effexor.

But it's been so long since I have been on any of those medications and to this day I have still been getting these brain zaps randomly throughout my days (sometimes they gets spaced by a week or so).

I was wondering if anyone here might have some insight into the question of **why am I still having brain zaps**?

As opposed to many antidepressants (eg SSRIs)

Now, paradoxical serotonin effects, or some influence on BDNF. IIRC, it's been established that agomelatine's antidepressant effects are independent of its sleep-health-promoting effects (which are well-supported).

I immediately when into SSRI withdrawl the day I switched to Viibryd.  I expected this for a few days until my body got used to Viibryd but didn’t expect that severe of symptoms considering that they’re both SSRIs and in the past I haven’t had that many problems switching from one to another.  

SSRI withdrawal symptoms for me have included very frequent brain zaps, irritability, etc.  After 5 days I went up to 20mg of Viibryd in an effort to curb my SSRI withdrawal symptoms.  It helped somewhat, but then the side effects of Viibryd kicked into high gear.  Bad nausea (up to gagging/near vomiting a few times), frequent bowel movements (not diarrhea but close), insomnia, waking up during sleeping

The brain zaps coming off the Lexapro have been particularly bad

I’ve been on Viibryd for 9 days

I should have researched more on this before switching as IMHO doctors don’t have a clue as to what they’re doing ½ of the time.  I believe the Lexapro should have been tapered down to 15 mg for a week or two and then to 10 mg for a couple of weeks before switching and ramping up the Viibryd.  The SSRI withdrawal combined with the nasty side effects of Viibryd is the worst I’ve ever experienced in 10 years of SSRIs.

It’s much too early to tell if the switch will be worth it.  I’m hoping that Viibryd will provide better relief for my depression.

For anyone thinking of taking Viibryd

My apologies if this is rambling... I can’t even begin to tell if it is or not in my current condition.  The main point is to educate yourself on Viibryd as it seems to be quite a bit different than other SSRIs on the market.


UPDATE:  A day later and I'm feeling a bit better.  I stuck with the Viibryd since I wasn't quite as bad and felt I could continue.  Much less of the brain zaps and numbness, jittery.  But these went away and I'm dealing.  Hopefully another week and I'll be feeling more myself.

I can see why this med can be used off-label for premature ejaculation!
But anyway this is massively affecting my sexual life. Not only does it make it hard for me to climax but it also massively reduces my sensation. This means that I really can't feel much down there. It makes me not perform as well sexually but also demotivates me from carrying on.
The women I've been with become extremely frustrated and start to think that it's a problem with them rather than me.

I was looking at an adjuncticative medication called buproprion but I understand than in the UK it is only available for smoking cessation.

First, that I'm not depressed. I'm a mess. Drinking is so horrible, but what could be worse?

Constantly being messed up on the medication that's what.

This is not a finish line. I'm not going to submit this until it's through. I taken excessively large dose of an antipsychotic. Although it is half the maximum dose

What are some of the real consequences of taking medication? Life is important. Nothing seems important when you're on the medication. I'm afraid it when I get off the medication my life will be over. I'm afraid I've taken the wrong steps towards recovery needless to say with the medication but as well as the decisions that I made while on the medication. So the problem is that you don't view things is important so you let them go when you're on the medication. When you're on the medication you don't need these things. The similarity to drugs is terrifying. It is honestly like I am on a drug at all times.

I've been taking medication for four years. The medication is an antipsychotic. I would like to repeat I'm not depressed.

Why have I been on the medication for so long? Well, I think about how sad it makes me that I've been wasting my time trying to do these things. I've actually spent much of my time much too happy or avoiding my real problems, which are mostly social in nature.

I want to say again that I'm not depressed.

I do have insomnia however. I have medication for insomnia. I also seem to have some small level of anxiety, I still am completely miserable. Or at the least it would appear that way. But I'm not depressed.

I can't experience pleasure and it's not because I'm schizophrenic. I cannot experience pleasure because of medication. When I get off the medication I don't feel anxiety because I'm schizophrenic. I feel anxiety because I'm having withdrawals from the medication. The kind of problems I have when I'm off the medication are a result of me being on the medication for so long at such high dose. The medication seems to suspend my headspace in a kind of out of control mania which I rely on to avoid my real problems which the medication doesn't solve. I can't confirm that withdrawals are involved with medication I take however I do know that with pharmaceutical drugs nearly every one that is psychotropic has withdrawals and this medication is psychotropic.

&gt;Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that is currently used as a smoking cessation aid. Bupropion interferes with monoamine reuptake and is potentially neurotoxic, c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) within 1 h, which later declined to baseline levels. However, bupropion failed to splice X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. Bupropion caused mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activated caspases 9, 8, and 3 in a time-dependent manner. The reduction in cell viability was significantly inhibited by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Bupropion also induced the mRNA expression of the death receptors DR4 (TRAILR1) and DR5 (TRAILR2). However, our data indicate that bupropion activates caspase 3 through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and activation of JNK

What does this mean exactly? If one were to take bupropion for over 10 years
