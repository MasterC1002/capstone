1352916604.0,136wyw,Trends in Engineering Student Resumes - Top Mistakes After Reading 100+,,462,76,178,"A few weeks ago our group of engineering recruiters threw up a thread where we were accepting and reviewing engineering student resumes. [Check it out over here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/119sce/need_help_on_your_resume/) We ended up reviewing hundreds of resumes

#1. Perhaps the most interesting one is that well-formatted resumes almost always belonged to students with a lower GPA. Students with higher GPAs (3.5+) almost always had badly formatted resumes. My guess is that students with lower GPAs focus on presentation value to make up for the weaker GPA. There is good news for them - it works! The presentation value matters more than you think it would. Having a bad resume is like not wearing a suit to an interview. When we have to sort through resumes quickly, we might as well choose the guy who has a nicer resume. After all, it looks like he put more work into his job hunt.

This trend seems like a really strange thing to us overall. You work hard and pay big money for an education to get an awesome job. If you have a 3.8

#2. After staring at a stack of resumes, but if you want to get the scoop faster, [subscribe to our newsletter!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com)

#3. About half of the resumes submitted did not have a GPA attached. People who expressed concern that their GPA was low didn't actually have extremely horrible GPAs. Most people who said they were low were in the ~2.7 range, you are automatically disqualifying yourselves from some good job opportunities.

If your GPA is not listed we know you are hiding something. Instead of making us work to call you or interview you about your GPA to make sure you are a good fit

If you are still nervous

Listing your GPA

#4. A decent number of people put pictures in their resumes. We have seen pictures of people's faces, pictures of application icons, and more. It looks funny! Having your face stare up at me will grab my attention, but in a bad way. Keep your resume picture free. It looks clean and professional that way.

#5. For descriptors,000 with your accomplishments? These are things that we are most interested in.

A real common one is that people like to put is their senior design projects on their resumes. Instead of speaking about what *you* did on that senior design project

#6. Although it's good to be specific on descriptors, but do not lose us in the finer details!

#7. We were surprised at how many people have had industry experience in terms of internships and co-ops, and you are a cashier presently at school, then do not list cashier first on your resume! The internship from ExxonMobil is much more impressive and should be listed first.

So make sure your best experiences are up top. Recruiters who are in a massive hurry might not read the bottom halves of your resumes.

Let us know what you think and post any questions on anything - resumes, whatever.

Do you want an engineering recruiter to critique your resume? We can – it’s what we do.

We just released our first service and are offering a promotion to get the buzz going. We will look at your resume and offer personalized advice for $4.99 until November 21st. After that

Any other

**tl;dr** Write down your GPA. Format matters. No graphics. Talk about what *you* did. Be specific on your descriptions but don't get too technical. Put the good stuff at the top of your resume.

[EDIT] Thanks for the great response everyone! It looks like we answered everyone's questions. Feel free to PM this Reddit account or email us at talk@cockrellcareeradvice.com if you want to touch base.",,t5_2sh0b,1353078349.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/

---

There have been some number of posts on r/EngineeringStudents providing or requesting study/cheat sheets for various topics and courses.  I did my best to go through old posts and put them all in one dropbox folder for everyone's benefit:

* [/r/EngineeringStudents study sheets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/prq54ou3asfln3y/lg6BmxdZU7)

They are organized by general topics.  Organization is likely to change as more guides are added.

Also

* [Andy Friedman's Physics/Math/Astronomy Cheat Sheets](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~afriedman/CheatSheetsIndex.html)

---

If you have any of your own that you'd like to contribute

My personal recommendation on use of these is to not have them replace any cheat sheets you need for your own exams

Sorry for not attributing all the authors

    All word is completed for this testing cycle.

    The students were strung out on stimulants ingested
    gotten from baristas from who they requested.
    We study so much
    The last time we had a decent meal

    Projects were rushed and barely finished on time;
    the fact that there are exams should be considered a crime.
    Too many units were taken this quarter
    Professors scheduled exams in the worst possible order.

    Not the first time this happened
    I still look forward to when this will all be in the past.
    Such is the life when you take engineering
    Call me crazy

    Now the library is crowded for another all nighter
    I remember the days where I only solved voltage dividers.
    This is the final push
    Then off to spring break

I did my BS EE at UT Dallas. Graduated Spring 2012. So its all fairly recent. I also have a psych minor, I believe I have a lot of the syllabi in there as well to help you reference similarities. I did my best to take the ""right"" profs, but I slipped here or there. Generally you want to take the ones I did.  

I hope this helps you.  
  
PS: I have a lot of finals reviews and stuff in there (in some cases the finals themselves).

Keep in mind that I am a mechanical engineering student


*  What kind of computer devices would you recommend, desktop, tablet?

     This is something that is going to vary substantially, but few (if any) engineering software packages run on them, and no FEA (again, we'll talk about this later) packages are mac compatible as far as I can tell. 

    In addition, they don't have to be large, but just having two of them makes all the difference) and a higher end (by higher end I don't mean latest generation by any means, just something that's come out in the last ~4 years and can play most modern games on decent settings).

    This combination lets me do schoolwork at school

     In terms of tablets, I wish I had a tablet for my last career fair to show off a video of a computer simulation I made of a [soda can being crushed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqs_J0zsf68).  I would never suggest a new student purchase a tablet to assist with their academic studies.  

* Textbooks

    First thing first, digital or hard copy?

    Where digital books work:  GE papers where you have to read one book source and write a report on a topic.  An example, used the PC kindle reader, used the find tool and found every instance of ""France"" in the book.  I was able to put together a very thorough outline and despite my paper being 2 pages short of the ""minimum length"", I got an A with a comment ""excellent analysis"", as it was so thorough.  I saved myself a crap ton of time, by doing this and would recommend using e-books in this regard.

    Where digital books don't work:  Engineering books just don't translate into digital versions well.  Often in my engineering books I'm flipping through chapters very quickly trying to find a specific chart/graph or something to that effect, but that's the end of that.  Also, many engineering exams are open book, and that will be hard to justify use of your laptop/tablet during an exam.

    Always buy books used if they're at all cheaper than the new books.  Rarely should you buy from your college bookstore, I have always [resold them back to amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sell-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2205237011).  I often sell back my engineering books and purchase an older edition of the same book (if there is a substantial price difference).  There is no reason to have the latest edition of a textbook on your shelf after you've taken the course.  Also, you might be able to use an older edition textbook during the course, this will vary from course to course based on how the professor runs his class.

* Software Packages

    A lot of this will be more useful once you've given your .edu email address.  For the purposes of this guide

   * [Sign up for dropbox](http://db.tt/PWFSnWVk).  The link posted is a referral link, you will get a double referral bonus, so every time you refer someone to use dropbox, instead of getting 250MB, you'll get 500MB.  

    * [Learn LaTeX](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/) if you want to make your work stand out from the rest.  [Here are a bunch of useful links](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/j2326/getting_started_with_LaTeX) regarding LaTeX.  A popular Windows LaTeX client is [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/).  If you hand in work/reports using LaTeX

    * MatLab must be had.  While it's impossible to just say ""install and learn how to use matlab"", you will use MatLab there as well.  Some classes will require you use it more than others, but never, ever, shy away from it.  

    * SolidWorks is a damn near requirement for Mechanical Engineers.  [Here is a link to their facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/solidworks).  I linked the facebook group because they periodically give away a educational software licenses

    * AutoCAD Inventor is the AutoDesk alterantive to SolidWorks.  I've used it a little because I had to for a course, and [it can be downloaded here](http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=download_center). 

    * Some students also use [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/)

    * Microsoft Office 2007/2010 cannot be avoided.  Yes there are other alternatives, you're going to want your Word Processor to match everyone else.  Learn the advanced features of Word and Excel.  In Word, learn how to reference stuff, and otherwise build your ""Works Cited"" page, Table of Contents automatically.  

    * For collaborative projects where people must work on documents simultaneously

    Now that I've discussed software, or any digital work of yours.  When you get close to graduation, you may want to built a portfolio showcasing your past work.  Always save everything.  I've had companies ask me for writing samples on a somewhat specific topic.  ""Sure no problem, here is a copy of my heat transfer design project write up"".  


Community college transfers, electricity and magnetism, programming and materials background than my classmates that were at the University from freshman year.  You will be competitive, however the roles of the professors will change drastically.  Be prepared to teach yourself more often than you're accustomed to (this goes for Freshman students as well), which is not necessarily a bad thing, however be aware of the change of the role.  

The other thing that I need to recommend is to not worry about studying ahead before a course begins.  The best thing you can do to prepare for your University courses is to go to school relaxed and well rested.

General Tips:  

1.  Apply to tons of places early
2.  Use your school's job resources, and just giving the resources to connect with employers.  It's much easier to get a job while still in college than out of college.
3.  Run your resume and cover letters off friends or family who are good at that kind of stuff.  Pay attention to details.  I bounced my resume off at least 5 people and went through at least 20 revisions since I first worked it up.
4.  Use ACTION WORDS on your resume and make it sound like you did great stuff, it allowed me to meet a lot of great people, and I was able to see a whole'nother side of the business which was great for my development because my other internships were heavily engineering based.""  but it worked for the 3 interviewers who asked about it.  I also talked about how it helped develop my report writing and stuff like that (in addition to other things).  In reality I wrote 1 real report, 1 stupid report, went on a few trips with the office, and slept in my office all day otherwise.  My resume essentially goes: Education, Experience, Knowledge.  
5.  Get as many interviews as you can BEFORE the big one that you really want.  After your first two interview, but better than screwing up when it really matters.
6.  Spend time designing your resume.  I actually built mine in Illustrator with the help of my girlfriend and I think it definitely helps show pride in your work over a shitty Word template.  Word actually has decent templates now that will probably work too.  (I may edit it and send it to anyone interested if there's enough interest).
7.  Job fairs suck

Interviewing Tips:  Look [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cxpq8/what_are_the_dos_and_donts_of_a_job_interview/c9kyssy) for more info because this post helped me immensely.

1. Dress well. I see so many engineers dressed like slobs with clothes that don't fit or are all wrinkled.  I would be very hesitant to hire them if I were doing the hiring, black slacks, and dress shoes.  Make sure your pants are well fitting, and worn correctly. Seriously, this is a huge first impression and you don't want to look like a slob.  Don't wear loud stuff like red shirts. It really just looks weird.  
2.  Learn about the company, and touch on why you were happy to hear the answer they gave or why that is great for you.  The questions aren't to waste time, they are to show yourself off and allow you to understand the position and company.  Look to the next point to see where many of your questions/answers should in some way point.  
3.  Write down questions you have, NOW CONVINCE YOURSELF.  Remember the list and read it to yourself because you are the shit going in and you need to convey that.  You are the best person to sell yourself and the only person to sell yourself.  **They are looking for someone who can do the job (easy), is going to work hard, stay with the company, and be a good fit with the employees.**  All your answers and questions should essentially lead back to proving this to them.  
2.  Make eye contact, and say it in the thank you and goodbye with a solid handshake.  
3.  Ask them how their day has going
4.  Try to be relaxed and have fun.  Yeah, you should be getting as many interviews as you can early to work it off.  Sorry.  
5.  Be ready with great things to say about your past experiences.  Write them down and remember them.  Always positive
6.  Talk to someone on the phone or something before going for the interview
7.  You should have some situations in mind for times when you were the leader (Think of a random group project where you acted as the coordinator and be ready to discuss it)

I hope you guys find these helpful because I spent a lot of time on this post!  I really dont mean to sound like a know-it-all; its all basically things that HELPED ME PERSONALLY overcome what was a huge stress in my life.

The most helpful thing for me was to make a notebook and write down why you are a great person, etc and convincing myself of it.

No matter what your major

Everything today is moving towards simulation due to it's increase in ability to reflect what will happen in the real world, chemist, civil, geologist, etc, you will eventually need to learn some kind of programming language in order to complete your job.

My advice is to start early instead of waiting until you are a few years into your degree and find that you are behind the curve in a class because you don't know how to simulate your experiment in MATLAB

Almost all colleges should offer an introduction to programming class(es)

This is only one person's advice

**Before the Interview**

Well one of the toughest parts is over with. You have landed an interview! By preparing yourself

If you haven't already

* Printed résumé (Ensure there is enough copies for all recruiters)
* Transcript (Whether unofficial or official
* Notepad/Portfolio (For notes if necessary)
* Business Cards 
* Project Work (Haven't personally done this

Also find out about the dress code of the interview. I have had a recruiter call and tell me whatever I am wearing is fine

* [About: Dress Code Help](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/interviewattire/a/interviewdress.htm)

If you can find out the recruiter's name before hand

Find out as much as you can about the company, what they are looking for.

And finally

* [Lifehacker: Standing out from Other Applicants](http://lifehacker.com/5993471/stand-out-from-other-job-applicants-by-bringing-extra-materials-to-the-interview)
* [Lifehacker: Highlighting Intangibles to Sell Yourself](http://lifehacker.com/5993918/highlight-intangibles-in-your-job-interview-based-on-the-jobs-listed-duties)
* [Lifehacker: Ask an Expert about the Job Search Process](http://lifehacker.com/5993164/ask-an-expert-all-about-the-job-search-process)

**During the Interview**

Check in at the location you are interviewing at least 15 minutes prior to the interview starts. 15 minutes has been good for me so far, so if you can bring some printed material or have notes to review during your waiting time, that would pass the time.

When you meet the recruiter do your best to make a great first impression

**Interview Questions**

Whether you are in a face to face interview or a phone interview

You can find some great questions and response ideas and thoughts here: 
* [Lifehacker: Post College Survival Guide](http://lifehacker.com/the-post-college-survival-guide-509417753)

I have had 2 interviews which have utilized the ""STAR"" method of behavioral interviews. Situation or Task
* [STAR Method](http://www.stuaffrs.wayne.edu/resources/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf)

**Phone Interviews**

While a phone interview is in no way less important than a face to face interview

With a phone interview you can also have some questions pre-answered. I find a few questions I expect and then come up with short key words that will remind me and write them down on a notecard. Then when I am approached with that question

**After the Interview**

Make sure to thank the recruiter, I always compose a nice thank you email to the recruiter. It still keeps you in their memory, and some of the recruiters that I interviewed with would have made their initial cuts and decisions before they received the card in the mail. 

If you do receive an offer

If you have not yet received an offer or a no

If you decline the offer

* [Lifehacker: How to Accept/Decline Job Offers](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-accept-and-decline-job-offers-498466080)


**Other Stuff**

* Ensure that your social media does not harm you in any way. You can control what you are tagged in in Facebook
* Would you hire you? Think about it. If you were interviewing yourself
* Be honest
* If you are crazy about a company


**Summary**

There is no right or wrong formula to interviewing. If your school has mock interviews to practice that could be worthwhile if you are unsure as to what expect.

Your friends and others at school may be a resource too if they have interviewed with the company in the past.

Confidence sells.

**Best of Luck!**

The average Marquette engineering student takes 134 credits. That’s 134 times 16 weeks (in a semester) which equals 2, which brings us to a total of 5,360 hours spent on our degree. Standard starting salary without a college degree is $26,000, while average starting salary for an engineer is $62,000.  This equates to either a $6.72 pay raise every hour that is spent on homework or a $16.79 pay raise for every hour in class. There’s no job on the planet where you can get pay raises that often!

Good advice for those wondering how they're going to make it through the semester.,annie-adderall,128,26,28,"""**How do I motivate myself to get through the burn at the end of a semester of engineering?**

Burn everything.

Now I'm not saying burn down the building. It stems from my analogy of what engineering school is like.

You are the conductor of an old school steam train. Trying to get from point A (beginning of semester) to point B (the last final). The train is your life.

You start out, trouble. The first hill (Midterms Round 1) looms up in front of the train, you panic. Throwing as much coal as you can onto the fire you pay no attention to how much there is. You keep telling yourself ""I just need over this hill, just need over this hill. It's all that matters right now so I need to use as much as is needed."" Finally, disaster is averted and the train is cruising down the other side of the hill.

But the downhill is much shorter than the uphill and another hill (Midterms Round 2) is no longer ""way in the distance"". It's getting closer. Looking back in the coal car you see that you are through over half of it. Panicking you run through all the cars looking for more coal. There is none there. Every car holds your posessions, your family. Everything you've put time into up until this moment is on the train.

You realize that if you don't get to point B

You hit the hill while you were busy reflecting and spending some moments with friends and family. The train has already lost momentum

In a flash

Thinking it's over

So you go through the cars and gather everything that you cannot live without. Your immediate family. Your best friend. Your girlfriend. Your sanity. Everything else gets left on the passenger cars. Aquaintances, your hobbies, your pride and your hopes. With a sigh of regret and a twinge of pain, you disconnect the passenger cars, leaving the dead weight that was your life behind.

The light train builds up some steam with the little fuel it has left and you prepare to hit the hill. You hit the hill. Burn everything. The carpet

You tell your family you'll see them later and kick them off.

You hope your best friend understands as you throw him out the back of the train (anything for that extra push).

You kiss your girlfriend goodbye and tell her you'll meet her there.

Finally

You get to point B. You recover as much as you can. Hell even your sanity is still alive. But it's not quite the same...it twitches occasionally and sometimes stares off into the distance

And that

Dismantle your life for every scrap of motivation and work ethic you can. The valuable things will survive.""",,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pt0zd/found_this_gem_on_rengineering_over_a_year_ago/

I recently completed my first year of engineering school.

I feel an immense amount of fear -- there's really no other word for it -- when I contemplate going into engineering as a professional after I've earned my degree. This is partly because I feel like my peers are more gifted than me in a lot of ways -- I've had my struggles in my first year classes and it takes more effort for me to retain and truly understand concepts than them. 

Dedicating myself to learning the sciences has humbled me quite a bit -- I feel like there's too much information to absorb and learn. I truly feel like I know absolutely nothing about anything in my field, don't get me wrong, but I don't know where to begin learning everything I'll need to learn in order to be a good engineer. I desperately want to learn more about my field ('cause materials are so fucking awesome), but I don't know where to start. I fear that everything that I'd try to read would go way over my head and I wouldn't understand it at all because I only have a basic grasp of math/chem/physics. 

I've always been a self-starter and I've loved learning about just about anything, simply because I love problem-solving and playing with things in the lab. 

Putting those two things together

TL;DR I feel like I'm inferior to my peers and I don't know nearly as much as I'd like to about my field (materials) but I'm afraid that I wouldn't understand anything I'd read. Therefore

1) Does anyone else have this fear?

2) Any suggestions about how to get more involved in my field this summer and beyond?",,t5_2sh0b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wlh1g/anyone_else_feel_like_theyll_never_be_a_good/

Well every fucking question was extremly vague and you had to do a massive iteration using one of god knows how many equations. It was set up as difficulty as possible... It was way beyond the difficulty level in any of the homework problems or class problems (or textbook problems). I almost started bawling my eyes out 1/2 way through the test, it's not offered again until next Spring so if I fail I won't be able to take 2 classes next semester I'm enrolled in (since it's a pre-req). WHY DO THEY MAKE THIS SO FUCKING HARD, at least offer classes in the summer once in a while so every absurdly hard class doesn't set you back 500 years. Why couldn't maybe just 1 problem be an iteration and the 2 other ones be basic ones like the homework problems? Most regular majors tend to have classes every semester or during the summer... even MechE and Electrical at my school offers fucking summer classes if you fuck up, it's like my program is designed to swallow you into school for ever and ever.

Then again, I'm 23 and won't be able to graduate until at least 2015 (which would be pushed back to 2016 if I failed HT AGAIN). And what's sad is I'm probably 36 credits away from graduating (assuming I fail HT and pass all my other classes this semester). sigh",,False,,t5_2sh0b,1366671772.0,,

I just got an F on an exam today and it's demolishing my motivation to continue on.  It's also making me re-evaluate whether I'm studying the correct way or not.

My problem isn't about sacrificing my social life or whatsoever.  I don't have too much of a problem spending 9am all the way till midnight on a Saturday doing work

The way I study is to read the text from the beginning of the chapter til the end, I'm HEAVILY behind in all my classes, despite the HOURS I'm putting in.

Something is not adding up.

I read many other posts out there

I need a better way to manage my time.  I've been scheduling my time in excel sheets; however I find that I always fail to follow it and always need more time then the amount I allotted myself.  I understand we're all different learners... but I'd still love to hear how you guys manage to stay on top of things.  

I have many side projects I wish to work on and would also appreciate an hour or two of just playing video games once in a while.  However all my time is spend towards school work... and I'm not even doing well.  

Any response and insight is greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys.

EDIT

Quick link to how I write notes.

Thanks for all the helpful comments.  I'd like to include a detailed description of my study habits so you guys can better understand what I'm doing.

For Linear Algebra, when things got deeper, for instance when we had to figure out how to ""shear transform"" simple figures and answer questions like ""Is T 'onto' or 'one-to-one'?"", I realized ""Holy shit, we're skipping over huge amounts of material. And I'm sure you guys realize that Transformations are a huge part of the concept.

What I did to remedy the situation? KhanAcademy. Watched about 20+ videos on Saturday as well as doing the homework and reading the textbook content. This took the whole Saturday. Not kidding
I'd watch a video and take notes

For a class like Physics
For classes like Material Science and Introduction to Digital Logic Design

My current situation? Currently heavily behind in every one of my classes and I don't have time to do my same normal note takings. This leads to the fact of me not understanding the material as well as I wish, so I would read the textbook in frenzy (no notetaking, only skimming).

You know, I'm in a shitstorm. I also attend a school that works on Tri-Mesters (10 week quarters instead of semesters), so that definitely makes things a lot worse.

First

And descriptors are deceptively easy. There is only one mistake can be made with descriptors: focusing purely on macroscopic responsibilities rather than writing about real results and exactly what you

Be specific when writing your descriptors. Amazing descriptors will say exactly what you did. Do not talk in big terms of what your team or project worked on. As an example, but what does it tell an employer about the candidate? What part did you design? What new information has an employer learned about you? The answers to these questions are weak.

A stronger descriptor might read

A good idea to keep in mind is that your reader should be able to visualize parts of your work based on the descriptors. If a visual image cannot come to mind

We can go one step further. Employers love to see the results of your hard work. Big questions to keep in mind are:

* Did I earn recognition for my work? (Awards, publications)
* Did I save the company money or time?
* Did I develop new skills?
* Can I quantify any success?
* Can I show experience as opposed to telling it?

Using the same senior design example, but you did it better than anyone else.

Here are some other examples:

For a research experience, “Awarded a $1000 research grant by the university” (recognition, quantify), “Used MATLAB to simulate bacterial growth” (skills).

For work experience, show not tell), “Streamlined plant risk management inspections by designing a more efficient inspection process” (save time), “Tested equipment to increase flue gas desulfurization by 30%” (quantify).

For extracurriculars,000 for breast cancer research” (money, quantify), “Recruited 25 new students to the organization” (quantify), “Elected Vice President for the year 2011” (recognition, leadership skill).

Here are some descriptors from actual resumes that we would consider poor: “Supported engineering staff” (tells us nothing meaningful that the job title hasn’t already told us), “Developed new methods and procedures to improve quality” (what kind of methods and procedures and improved by how much?), “Excellent computer proficiency” (be specific, what programs or languages do you know?).

tl;dr:

* Be specific and results-oriented with your descriptors.
* Ask yourself if you learned any new skills
* For group projects

If you like what you read

If you have questions let us know. We’re here to help. Just reply to this reddit thread or email at talk@cockrellcareeradvice.com

If I could do it over again, and chosen a city that I would like to live.  Then I would have applied for an operator or maintenance mechanic position.  



Operators in most Petro/Chemical plants make up to $120k/yr with overtime and the work is usually very simple: sitting at a DCS control board, etc.  Mechanics are doing things like changing out valves, fixing pumps, checking lubrication, repairing leaks, and much more.  Both of these roles would provide you with the best experience you could ever ask for - experience that would make you a top-notch engineer.  Also, most companies dont even require their operators to have a college degree, you do get several days off in between shift swings.  If you are willing to put in the hours, and you will develop an intimate relationship with the other operators and the equipment of your plant



After a year or so of operations or working as a mechanic, who are the people that truly get shit done in a plant.  The salaried management would already respect me because of the safety and monetary impacts I had on the operations of my unit (something any of us would be capable of doing being an engineer in a blue collar role).  



And the best part.  I also will have $50, booze and strippers if thats your thing).  And I can pretty much guarantee that that new engineering salary will be more than the $60k you would have gotten right out of school. 



If someone had told me to do this a year a go I would have jumped on it.  Especially with the job market being so cut-throat right now for engineers.  Work hard for a year



Apologies for the changing I/You subject of the paragraphs.  You know what I mean.

There is a girl in one of my engineering classes and I have a HUGE crush on her. I'm daydreaming about this girl 24X7. The problem is that we're both electrical engineering majors and will probably have a shit load of classes together so I don't want to ask her out and make it awkward.

Now that the first midterm has been returned

1) Your overall grade reflects both the exam and the homework. 

2) If you drop the course now,000 to pass ME242, could you do it? 

3) ALL students can pass ME242 if they put in enough time (albeit some students need more time than others). Ask yourself if you can find another hour everyday to study by giving up something else (again,000 to study instead of watch TV or hang out with friends, could you do it?).

4) If you really don't think you can pass, etc.) or bad (if you don't like my teaching style or think I'm harder than the other professors).

5) You may be like many students and just cannot find enough time to work, etc. If this is the case, you may have taken on too many responsibilities. In this case, dropping is probably the best course of action - but don't delude yourself into thinking you can still graduate in 4 (or even 5) years. The fact that you are very busy this semester is not likely to change in the future.

6) Last day to drop a class is next Friday (March 23rd).

Background about me:

Spent 4 years at community college programs in Drafting and in Machine Tools so yeah I have 2 AAS Degrees. Currently working towards a BS in Mechanical Engineering Tech as it's less time for me to finish than BSME. I've used... Paper, Solidworks '06-'09, CATIA V5, UG NX 7.5, ProE 4.0, and MasterCAM (9-X4). Out of those software packages the one's I've used really extensively are AutoCAD (Modeling, Drawing), Surfacing, Routing

TL

What am I telling you?

I see at least once every 3 days a post entitled something like ""I want to learn AutoCAD (Solidworks, Matlab)."" Lately it seems every time I just slam my head on the desk. The only answer you are going to find is that you just need to use the software. I cannot teach you AutoCAD just so that you learn AutoCAD. I remember taking ""Intro to AutoCAD"" which was something like 8 hours a week lab time plus homework. At the end I could competently use AutoCAD but then as I got further into classes in GD&amp;T, Tool &amp; Die Design, and others I still had to go back and look up things I didn't know. I built familiarity through using the software. There is no golden book for any software that can really teach you that package as well as you sitting at a computer and using the software.

Also remember that some of these software packages have so many modules that it's nearly insane to try to learn that software. Like if someone said ""Teach me UG."" I know absolutely nothing about ship-building so there's a few modules in there I wouldn't have the slightest idea how to utilize. For a non-electrical guy what about the CircuitWorks package in Solidworks... useless.

So what's my advice?

If you want to learn a software start using it. Ask yourself what you want to do with that software such as do you want to model a stamping die

The thing is that software in the engineering world is so vast in it's capability anymore that learning with just the intent to learn will lead to nothing. You need to know what you want to do with the software. Learn how to do that task.

As a final word I'm going to say if you are unable to designate what you want to DO with a software then maybe learning the software isn't the best use of your time and you should back up a bit.

The fun of summer has ended and another term is looming dark over our heads. Maybe summer wasn’t so fun for you and you decided to take courses to try and make up for goofing around your freshman year. Maybe (if you are like me) you needed to retake a course so that you could move on.  Maybe
Well, get the fuck out.  This pretty much goes for anything you do in life. If you don’t love what you do, find something to do that you love. Life is too expensive to waste doing shit you hate.  


For those of you that are still here, then welcome to my world.  If you are in a position where you are wondering if you should give up that dream, DON’T. Make your school force you out. Even then, see if there is a way around them forcing you out. Did you fail physics three times and are facing removal from your engineering program? Find out if there is a community college that you can transfer in to, knock out the physics (or whatever classes you can) and get back into your primary school and get back on track. Not only will you be able to move on, but you will save some cash for classes as well.  Are you on the verge of failing out? Fuck a social life, study…study…study. Get tutoring, do something so that you can stay in your program.

My point here is, make the sacrifice and GET IT DONE. If you quit, you will always look back and wonder “what if”.  And that is a shitty position to be in….

Thus began my journey back to school. 

I had wanted to go back the last year I was in Austin but between money, I never did. In the Winter of 2010 I was admitted to the hospital and spent the next 5 days there recovering from what I later found out is Crohn's disease. My parents being supportive of me and wanting to help me succeed allowed me to move back in with them and paid for my tuition at San Antonio College (SAC). 

For the next 2 years, and Calculus I/II once (at university). My favorite class at SAC was the intro to engineering course, taught by a professor from eastern Europe who looked and sounded like the old man in despicable me and had no tolerance for excuses. His class convinced me that I do want to be an engineer and that I will not stop until I have the degree.

I have not taken a traditional path in the slightest and I believe this is what worked for me. If you asked me in high school what I wanted to go to school for I would have said Doctor or Businessman, now I know it is because I was not applying myself fully.

Some members of this group will freeze up and admit that they don't know how to do it any other way.  This is a big complaint I have with my school--too many of the instructors show little shortcuts that allow translation into scalar operators.  It gives the students the impression that vectors were something invented by mathematicians just for the hell of it

Other students tell me that they should do ""whatever's easier"", I argue that they may get their homework done with less thought if they make these conversions, but they're missing out on the big picture...

Without accepting vector phenomena as such, is an operation that has very big physical implications, and can tell us a lot about a phenomenon.  Taking a cross product tell us things that ""ABsinΦ"" never will.  I see people use ABsinΦ, and then they can't even tell me which direction the cross product points.  This is no surprise, since they just performed a scalar operation.

So, the entire physical world does not reduce down to one-dimensional phenomena.  If you want to understand it and make predictions, you need to use the language that accurately represents it.  Once you start doing this, you will begin to realize what these operations actually do, and your understanding WILL propagate through all your courses.  You're going to be using a calculator anyway, so it's not like you need to worry about heavily involved arithmetic.  Speak the right language, and you will begin to understand things much better.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/smwvz/my_one_piece_of_advice_to_beginning_engineering/

For those curious, citations, tables, graphs, and diagrams. The project was a FEED study of utilizing micro-algae as a carbon sink for a coal-fired power plant. There was the technical side of designing a pilot scale and performing a techno-economic analysis. Plus a biological side where algae strains were selected based on the area's environment.

 I went into college at 16 and during high school I had this delusion that I was going to become an astronaut so I decided to go into an Integrated Master's in Aerospace Engineering. I started disliking it and getting mediocre results but everyone around me kept advising ""Don't worry! The early years are mostly weed out courses and generic stuff! The fun comes later!"". Well the ""fun"" never came and I was stuck in this damn course since I didn't want to graduate at 30 (and yet ended up taking 8 years to complete a 5 year degree). 

I tried getting internships but no one accepted me, etc, without going into any sort of necessary depth to actually CREATE something (this university while the best in my country is also infamously theoretical, leading to the common joke that all their engineering degrees are actually math degrees). 

Meanwhile, I feel like I haven't learned enough to do anything useful and by the time I get anywhere, I'm probably too old (the field is notoriously biased towards the young).

I feel like I ruined my life and want some honest advice on what's my best bet (even if it includes stuff like ""Go work as a janitor"" or something).

3. State what you have tried already
4. Don't give any deadlines for responses.  Even if you don't get a response in time before the assignment is due

And finally, but if there's a way to help out in the long run, that's more beneficial.

That should be all.  I think it's all pretty fair.

**About the university**

Aalborg University focuses on Problem Based Learning and group work. This means that every semester starts with forming groups between 7 and 2 persons

**About myself**

In denmark it is considered the norm to take both a bachelors and a masters, where I'm currently on my 2nd ( or 8th) semester.

**The common semester**

Each semester consists of 3 courses and a project. Most courses are pass-fail and all exams are open book

The projects are group projects and should fill about half the time each semester. They are graded and are usually the only grade you get for a semester. They often involve contact with a company

We have a fall and spring semester. The fall semester lasts from 1st of September untill the 22nd of December. Then there's a winterbreak until January where the exams are carried out. The spring semester then starts the 1st of February and lasts untill late May

**Courses**

Each lecture usually takes 4 hours - 2 hours of lecture

There is no turn-in homework

There are usually no office hours for professors - rather students are encouraged to swing by the professors office any time and ask questions if they have any. If the professors aren't there we usually just write them an email or check by later.

**Projects**

There's always atleast one professor assigned to a given student group

Every student group have their own room with blackboards, so they can leave their stuff there. This stuff usually include a fridge, a microwave, a coffee machine and extra monitors for their laptops.

The students are expected to analyze the problem they have chosen and to write up a requirementspecification. They are then to apply the knowledge they gain through their courses to their project. That means that all knowledge learned in courses usually becomes immidiately applied. This also gives a huge incentive to show up for courses

The projectwork is usually treated more as work, on a normal day. There's usually a supervisor meeting scheduled around once pr week.

**Tuition** 

As education is completely paid by the government in Denmark

**Housing**

There are very few classical dorms available. Most students live in their own apartments. There are however special students appartments available, internet etc.)

**TL;DR**: Few courses

Wow. That wasn't short at all.

1368958699.0,1emi7p,Studying Engineering in germany. A Quick report.,3l3s3,47,11,40,"Hi guys!
I thought i'd take a couple of minutes to give you a rough idea what it's like to study engineering in germany

**General:**
I study chemE with focus on biotechnology at one of the [TU9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU9). I am currently in my sixth semester working on my Bachelor's thesis. I'm an active member of the students council and help other students with whatever they need to be successful in their studies.
**Edit:** In Germany it is absolutely uncommon not to get a master's degree. We had the ""Diplom"" before and as that took about 5 years

**Semester times:**
We have two semesters a year. Wintersemester from October through March


**Lectures:**
We have approximately 6 different lectures per semester. Some of them come with extra classes where a TA shows how to solve problems and/or tutoring where you can solve problems yourself in small groups. Generally it is good advice to go to lectures and take exams in the order designed by the school. There are hardly any classes where attending is mandatory. Nearly all lectures are taught in german only. (There is a mechE program completely in english tough


**Exams:**
Very unlike what I read here very often about a designated 'finals week' our exams are spread out over the entire time of the semester where there are no lectures. (I have had as little as a friday+weekend entirely free time after my second semester, there are hardly any students that would pass the exams with significantly less time (they are frickin hard). Most exams are closed book closed notes but with formula sheets+ calculator. (Eg thermodynamics I + II closed book, closed notes, calc, formula sheet; higher mathematics i + II + III: lecturescript including notes + one published mathematical piece of literature + formula book + no calculator).


**Tuition:**
There is no tuition at most public universities. There is a relatively small administration fee (about 250€ per semester).


**Housing:**
There are dormrooms for as little as 150€ a month (9 m^2


**Personal remarks:**
I am currently looking for an Internship abroad; unfortunately I want to intern during the winter. That makes it somewhat harder...


**TL;DR:**
Studying engineering in germany is quite different.

If anyone has any questions

* Hopefully I'm not too late for this one, this will be your major talking point. Make sure it's a project that you are interested in. Do good work and maintain a professional but also personal relationship with your company contact. Many people get job offers through this. This is especially important if you have a less than desirable GPA. They won't care about your GPA if you demonstrated your can produce good work. Even if they can't offer something you have added someone to your network.


* This one is obvious, to give you a talking point. This will also allow you to speak about any other location you are interested in.


* Start skimming job postings now. This is extremely helpful. See what types of opportunities are out there. For example, aeronautics, HVAC, testing, manufacturing and the list goes on. Once you see exactly what's out there, research and decide types are best suited for you. Then, look at the common qualifications associated and use the remainder of your year building towards them. For example, take a production engineering class your last semester and gain a working knowledge of any program commonly listed in job postings. This will go miles.


* Start seriously applying right before your final semester. Like anything


* I personally recommend using engineerjobs.com as my main job search tool. It compiles searches from multiple job hunting sites. Craigslist is my #2. Nobody thinks of getting an engineering job on craigslist, and your resume goes straight to the correct person.


* Develop a somewhat personal relationship with a couple professors. You don't have to kiss ass or work as their research assistant

* If you have any sort of connections

* Update/Improve your cover letter/resume every few weeks. Just like doing a tough problem

* One more thing. Go back and skim any labs or projects that you have done in your Jr and Sr year just to jog your memory on what you actually did. Every once in awhile an interviewer will ask you about your experience with something. A lot of times you can use your experience with a simple lab or project to talk about. They eat that shit up. It's what got me an on site interview with the job I recently got. 


Cold calling/emailing random companies didn't seem to help. In my experience 90% don't answer and the other 10% turned me down

How helpful is the extra 4 years of getting a PhD? 

UCSD has this thing where you can get your master's a year after getting your undergrad degree. Is that worth it? Benefit is less time needed.

I wanted to update you all that I will start making posts this month! I aim for one post/video a day. I plan to briefly review topics on the general portion of the exam and to focus on how to solve problems using your calculator. The calculators permitted on the exam are very powerful and can solve nearly every problem on the exam (e.g. quick linear regression for thermo problems, stat functions, etc.)
  
The calculator I will be using is the Ti-36X Pro.  
  
I will make posts here, FE tutoring can be community driven and posts can be consolidated in one subreddit.
  
Let me know what you think and if you have any questions or suggestions regarding the first review post.
  
Until then, how to review stored values, and how this small function can change your life!

I feel like I was lied to about how my education would open doors. I feel like I was actively deceived about prospects for new grads. I was told if I did well I would have employers fighting over me. Nobody told me I *had* to have a co-op to do anything more than stack soup cans on shelves. Nobody told me I *had* to take the FE exam to be competitive. Nobody told me I *had* to go suck some professor’s dick to get network “contacts.” The “contacts” I do have won't respond

I feel trapped, as I see all of my peers advance leaps and bounds ahead of me in every way. Every day, as I wade through hundreds of so called “entry level” openings, I feel like I am inches away from bawling my eyes out. I am smart, I am driven, the work I do is *damn good*, and I don't stop until it is the very best I can do. I want to be the guy that kicks ass at work, to prove myself. And yet nobody will give me the time of day. 

If I apply online, why I didn't pick up a co-op (I needed to graduate asap to help out the family), why I didn't have a job at any point in my life (dying mother = no money; no money = no car;  no car = no job). I feel each step of my life was a choice, weighed and selected in logical steps, doing the best with the situation I had. But it doesn't work. I wont beg; I don’t want to be given a job based on some sob story about the kid and his dead mom. I want to be recognized as a good candidate based on my credentials.

And this is the worst part: Nobody coerced me into graduating in 4 years instead of 5 or 6. Nobody coerced me into trying to save my money and not taking the FE exam. Nobody coerced me into taking classes and labs when all the ASME/ASHRAE/Other meetings were being held. Nobody coerced me into focusing on my studies instead of picking up a job. I have nobody to blame but myself, my optimism, my self worth into cinders.

Please, and a large pool of candidates. I want to *earn* what I get. I know all of this, and I bust my ass for hours each day looking for jobs, and following up on those I can. But, shit, I graduated BSME with honors from a tippy-top-tier engineering school, with relevant extracurricular, and I get nothing. I see all these posts about how folks are finding their dream jobs. I see each and every one of my friends get their jobs

So here is my question

1357716236.0,168kqn,[tip] You don't calculate your GPA. Your school does.,glassgoat,36,9,35,"I see this topic come up a lot in this sub-reddit


With little exception

Some of you may be wondering ""But I want to list my major GPA, because they are the ones that know what courses to include. If they don't help you, sucks, you list the GPA that is on your transcript.

This brings me to the one exception: For some odd reason, because you don't have any other option.

Aside from that one exception, so your GPA on your resume better either be one that exists on your transcript, or one that you can say ""I worked with my school to calculate this more relevant figure."" (Even then, it sounds a little weak, doesn't it?) If they care about your grades, the worst thing you can say is, ""I decided which of my courses were most related

Note that while a lot of companies look for above 3.0/4.0, you have a 2.7). 

If a cut-off is hard

**tl;dr:** Your school calculates your GPA. If you need absolutely need a GPA for in-major or selective courses, it won't matter what you say your GPA is, it will matter what you school says your GPA is. 

edit: a good second exception from [u/yojfullness](http://reddit.com/u/yojfullness): If your school only provides GPA on a certain scale (say, 4.0).

The material is fascinating and I love learning all there is to learn about the physics side, but the prospect of actually working as an engineer fills me with dread.  I thought I would love this career path, and I'm resenting it already.  

I'm struggling with depression and anxiety.  A day of classes leaves me completely unable to handle anything else stressful; you see how this would cause problems.  I hate it, something practical that I can do with my hands.

J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited

Thank you so much for your time

(3.22) of Sec. 3.7 values of *T* (See Sample 8.3 200 pages back) can be substituted into Eq. (5.32a) and Eq. (7.333b) of section (Alpha Foxtrot 9.7).  This will yield values of J and i, and thus (Fig. 74.234^2 )

In conclusion Eq. (8.1) remains valid, thus X and Ybar, respectively, when theta is sufficiently small, and element is at the neutral surface (Eq. 5.4!), can be given by (I+*j*) x (*i*+**J**)/(C*c).""
