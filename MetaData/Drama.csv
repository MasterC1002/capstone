They also forced you to sign a TOS which disallows refunds.


Someone starts a [petition to remove on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/828925849084337399/) with over a thousand comments in it.

That's the important part to understanding these idiots. The real drama pops up in the actual pastebin logs, peer-reviewed scientific proof of TRPs claims. You can imagine how that went down.

This was a much shorter chat

&gt;Schadenfreude: ok, and I'm just wondering if this is really how redpill views rape: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1bma3e/i_found_rtheredpill_s_position_on_rape_surely/
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: I swear I'm not trolling by asking that
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: If you attack a stranger
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: OK
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: You'll have to be more specific.
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: well
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: what about date rape? You take a girl out
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: There are a few problems with that question.
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 1.) Unless I'm holding a gun to her head
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 2.) Her ""not being into it sober"" is such an ambiguous statement it is nearly impossible to define.
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 3.) The definition of rape should never change based on her feelings

This one was less drama-y

What you have there is a screen taken from a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bowyb/random_beta_comment_of_the_day_4413/c98nxum?context=3) that caused a bit of a shit-storm dustup on Men's Rights

You might also notice that Redpill has a mirror sub, that they even get the occasional TRPer, such as [EccentricDuck](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/19bouq/its_a_joke_sub_right/c8mxt0w), or the time Roe decided to do a [mini-AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1bauul/hi_im_one_of_the_red_pillers_that_youre_mocking/).

*OK

I'd like to see us all come together and really appreciate just how insane and stupid some people can be. This post may not have contained the most absurd drama, I encourage you all to enjoy the links, and when you see one of these sub-human shitpiles start defending their positions, feel free to link it here, in your local /r/drama.

How to begin? 

One of your moderators it seems has been co-mingling and aiding SRS in ridding Reddit of users that SRS elite members have deemed ""undesirable"" (see: SRSsucks/Anti-SRS members). 

A private subreddit, and harass Reddit users that they have deemed racist, misogynists and generally anti-SRS for the purpose of eventually getting them shadowbanned (oh and it works).

 And guess what? 

[One of your mods has been helping them the entire time](http://i.imgur.com/259bfEh.png). 
Please note the user being followed by your own mod

It doesn't stop at just one person though

&gt;I have gone above and beyond to send you folks the names

&gt;I'll continue supplying you with names.

Note that lovely plural. 

It doesn't stop merely at him aiding them to rid Reddit of Anti-srs/SRSsucks members

For more about the ""4chan stuff"" [see here and note that 4chan has had an anti-srs movement for months](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1a8nct/recap_pol_has_declared_war_on_srs/). Heard about it? No? Wondering why? 

**implications**:

The most obvious is that one of your mods is aiding SRS to stifle anti-srs rhetoric

The less obvious is that the same mod who is aiding SRS to rid the site of your own community is the same mod [""leaking"" entire pages (seemingly unabaited) from private SRS spaces](http://www.reddit.com/r/himisphere). Are you beginning to wonder why the leaks from SRShome are *less than entertaining*?

And of course

So in short

It looks to us

Which

Enjoy going the way of /r/antisrs

It seems that that post never got out of the spam filter before being removed. Then another thread (posted in comments btw twasi) was successfully posted

Edit: Good news everyone! They re-approved the thread.

But then locked the comments so only the mods could whine in it

I was just enjoying the private popcorn, so I pledged to take him down in mod mail. I wish I had more screens about this but I got demodded then. This led to public leaks, which made me look like the bad guy since only the private sub guys knew Lefto was the initial leak:

- TPS post with  more leaks: [Private sub of SRSsucks finds out LeftoNhahe is part of a SRS group. The mods want to keep him as a mole

Surprisingly the SRSsucks mods didn't remove him after they banned me for leaking and creating meta drama, well most of them..

So basically a pretty big thing went down in BattleGround Europe

- Antwerp is the biggest city in the game

- Axis have pushed the allied frontline all the way back to Antwerp, it can take hours, days, weeks to capture a town sometimes)

- Antwerp is the largest city in the game and therefore the hardest to cap

- Axis attacked the city and capped all but 2 CPs within the city

- An allied player by the name of 'DOC' who also happens to be an administrator decides to take down the server for maintenance with just a 10 minute warning

- The server is reset and the town is completely reset and is in allied control again

- Many axis high-command (experienced vets who have been playing for years) desert their post and leave the game forever

- The rest of the axis playerbase decide to give the map to the allies

- DOC starts banning people who speak out against the decision and the player base begins to decline and drama starts between allied and axis players.

- CRS (the devs) are being criticized left and right.

1374705894.0,1izlpa,[BREAKING] r/Drama mods take it too far. Drama and dissent are being censored.,Oligopetalous,59,23,75,"Hello /r/drama. There's something happening in *your own* subreddit that I thought you would like to know about. I just hope someone

It would appear that the mods of /r/drama have decided that they no longer agree with the upvote/downvote system which Reddit relies on. They have also gone to great lengths to silence dissenting opinion. How

Now, or even terse. 

So how, let me explain:

Earlier today

**Exhibit A: [The Post That Should Not Be](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1iu6jj/gossipso_reese_ridley_wanted_a_mod_spot_in/).**

This post is terrible. Like

Now, useless post make it to the front page? Nepotism, perhaps? Maybe a little bit of self-loathing? It doesn't matter though; without proof, all of this is just conjecture. 

But wait...

**EXHIBIT B: [Censorstart (aka the beginning of Censorship)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1izb9b/looking_for_some_interesting_new_drama_too_bad/)**

This is a thread I submitted earlier (at around ~8PM PST [I don't really live in that timezone (or do I?) but I'm not going to give those who would be affected by this information the chance to dox me.]). Did you happen to see it? Probably not.

Because it was deleted immediately after being posted

/u/MallardlyUpset (no witchunting)

Why? I followed all the rules. I used NP to stop vote brigading. I wasn't directly involved in the drama

Unless someone has a horse in this race that they don't know want us to know about. 

Oh

**Exhibit C: The mods will remove this post before you even get a chance to upvote it.**

Now

And the answer is yes. You *can* do something about it. I propose we created a new subreddit, blatantly censoring *our* drama. 

Just my two cents. Be careful out there guys. The censor ship will find you and sink you. ",self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1izlpa/breaking_rdrama_mods_take_it_too_far_drama_and/

This is the BODY text in case it gets removed immediately:

I'm just someone who was friendly with him and offered him to write a final post in case he got banned because he was fearing that. He himself sent me most of the info I will post here. 

Using a throwaway TOR account because I don't want to get involved.

The direct reason why he got banned: http://i.imgur.com/YgwqmAN.png - he made 4 comments in a SRD linked /r/news thread which the mods immediately removed. This was the comment he spammed: http://i.imgur.com/F2MBhab.png


Other reasons why he could have been banned:

- Making a lot of alts

- Having contact with /u/Youregonnaloveme who is also IP banned from reddit: http://imgur.com/k8ehZDP (Read from bottom to top)

- Sending PMs to several mod mails like /r/srdbroke

- Responding to a Daily Dot journalist Fernando Alfonso his PM: http://i.imgur.com/7IC7OKj.png  (he PMed a bunch of NSFW mods asking them if there was something going on around reddit) and trading information with him: http://i.imgur.com/gQgZxY4.png (read from bottom to top)

- Sending harassive PMs to mod mail like in r/news which got him banned in the first place: http://i.imgur.com/fZThR8a.png

- Wasting the admins time because people were reporting him and complaining about him all the time. Someone reported him for asking for CP for example: http://i.imgur.com/WghMutB.png

- Several cases of Doxxing: sharing a meme of a SRSer during doxxtober and also posting Laurelais penis with googly eyes photoshopped on it

- He got the crazy idea to start PMing shadowbanned users via MOD QUEUE and explain to them why they could have been shadow banned. He made /r/redditwatchdog and asked /u/Deimorz for feedback before he would make it public but Deimorz never responded and the other admins simply banned the sub once he got banned. There was a list there with all the possible bans and all the reasons why. Users would check the list first before they sent a PM to the admins asking about why they got banned.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Definition of things so far for newcomers**

As an explanation for newcomers

Shadowbanning is when you get banned for actually fucking up one of Reddit's few absolute rules: No spamming, posting CP, or really pissing off the admins. Or something. I don't know what the fifth rule is but I'm fairly sure that's how PIMA got destroyed a few months ago. 

Vote-gaming is when people use artificial means to get karma, but based on other means. There's a few websites that show how to catch reddit's interest so you can boost your website/ product, so I'm pretty sure that's a reason this rule is in place. 

Vote-gaming can be achieved by using bots, the like. As what likely happened here, all those power-users got caught funking around on the same askreddit thread, which according to Anal Queen was coordinated by someone else. 

What's a power user/ karmawhore, and has a large amount of karma from submitting and posting a lot. People like /u/syncretic are power users, modding a lot of stuff, posting a lot of stuff. 

Karmawhores are people that post a lot of shit for the sake of karma, so people will always upvote/ comment with them a lot. 

As a result, ran out (Trapped in reddit), or just ignored (apostolate. I hope. )

There are some very minor rule changes to our sub

Trolls will be banned. We don't need trolls in here fucking our discourse up with their *boring* **everything**. If you are here to simply troll

Users of **excessive** slurs - not cute. If the only shit they can talk consists of mindless slurrage

The mods will be handing out [warnings](http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/wsg/image/1339/22/1339225284605.gif) before any ban

**This does not mean** /r/Drama is a ""safe space

So, and not a [dick](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/239/112/29e.jpg). It's not super hard to figure out, and if you have any questions about our new rules, please feel free to ask. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention!

If all you can talk about is SRSsucks, we will so make fun of you for not having a life, or for having anything interesting to say, so keep that Reddit-centric political bullshit out of our sub. Thanks.

This is an effort to continue documenting Laurelai's sociopathy and general unbalanced mental state. In a recent popular thread in /r/anonymous...

- It begins in a spectacular melodramatic fashion where Laurelai claims that [an srser saved my life ( literally)](http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7je1ij)

- A hypocritical stament is made where she has the audacity to tell someone to [""lol get a life""](http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7jjaku) after just admitting to have been given a new lease on one. I gift her Reddit Gold for this comment after being stupefied at her lack of irony and self-awareness.

- Decide to publicy [call her out](http://i.imgur.com/EYNVq.png) on this. 

- The post is deleted shortly thereafter.

Laurelai didn't appreciate me calling her out in front of Anonymous

So I take it to /r/anonymous modmail to get to the bottom of this. 

- She completely takes the defensive position and starts spouting lies by [claiming I'm an SRDer](http://i.imgur.com/Aaj24.png) and that [I'm an invader](http://i.imgur.com/izjkU.png) when I've been a lurker in anon and have been following them for quite a while now.

- Bottom-mod FVAnon [chimes in](http://i.imgur.com/10mSO.png), that Anonymous is into Misandry"" with a [childish image](http://i.imgur.com/i6pPz.gif) of ScarJo from The Avengers

- [Further reinforcing](http://i.imgur.com/Q3XOC.png) that /r/anonymous is part of SRS/The Fempire with the image macro [""Ceterum Censeo Reddit Delendam Esse""](http://i3.minus.com/jswZu4dVVmalL.jpg)

- [Further lobbing an accusation of hypocrisy](http://i.imgur.com/Co8yk.png) is met with a [childish anim](http://i.minus.com/ibxo9BNVYxQgks.gif) where she implicitly states she does not care. She seems honestly comfortable and OK with being perceived as a hypocrite.

- Continuing her pattern of evasion

- Further taunting by asking [If I am mad](http://i.minus.com/iP3qeuHMYmHEI.gif) ?

- [I decide to wrap things up](http://i.imgur.com/Tmb2v.png) as there is just no getting through to someone like her.
   
So

Absolutely shameful. 

I expected better from Anonymous

Anon was supposed to destroy the Sith. Not join them.

Hopefully some of you are familiar with my anti-Gawker blog
 
* Uncovering the identity of Gawker writer Mobutu Sese Seko.

* Investigating whether Gawker swept a child porn controversy under the rug by firing one of their writers.
* Exposing Timothy Burke as a liar when he tried to use a sockpuppet account here on Reddit.
* Cataloging 218 Reddit accounts which I suspect were created by Gawker to spam their own links.

And I have a hunch--just a hunch--that Timothy Burke might be omitting some info regarding the whole Manti Te'o fake girlfriend hoax.  I don't trust that guy one bit.  I base that on past experience.

EDIT 2:  FIVE STRAIGHT HOURS researching some football player I don't even know

EDIT 3:  I found a bunch of tweets that Te'o sent out immediately after Lennay died.  He even signed into her account at one point to send a farewell message to her followers--he signed it Manti
(Not really.  Unless you're from TMZ.  They just printed a very helpful story.)

EDIT 4:  By the way

EDIT 5:  I'm not sure exactly what I was searching for, a message board for Notre Dame fanatics:

tl;dr: I found something on imgur via a friend outside of Reddit. I posted it to /r/gaming after changing the URL to a gallery because the initial URL wasn't working with RES properly and it instantly became a highly upvoted thread. Shortly after this

/u/utterpedant received great sympathy for my travesty of a repost and earned himself over a year's worth of Reddit Gold and plenty of comment karma. I on the other hand


But who cares about internet points? The problem actually revolved around the more personal aspect of things. During the onslaught of my comment history, and even some went as far as doxxing me to retrieve my Facebook information. I am not sure if this is the end of the doxxing, but I sincerely hope nothing further generates from this. I became one of the most witch-hunted person on Reddit, to the point where people were threatening me in PMs, both with insults and with releasing personal information to the masses.


Then there was a personal aspect of messages sent through Reddit. There were too many to list

etc, I'm surprised people got this worked up about it:

All in all, and whilst my intentions weren't malicious, I can see why the original creator would be upset. I can only offer my condolences. However, I think that going this far as to completely destroy someone's browsing activity (I will probably have to create another account), then taking it to extremes and digging up my personal information. That's too far.

Some stuff I'd like to warn you about... Stuff you should and shouldn't do

**1. Don't be an idiot**

If you say nonsense like that incel doesn't exist there's no point for me to reply. I'll just block you.


**2. Don't be a TAC member** 

TAC are The Atheist Cult

http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/quo-vadis-atheism/

http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/cult-of-therapy-a-dangerous-death-cult-created-by-tac/

It's easy to recognize a TAC member - stupidity, misandry, feminism, lack of any logic, nauseating political correctness etc.

I will not reply to juliewashere because she's a known TAC member. I would rather debate chimps than TAC members.

**3. This is an AMA. Ask questions.**

I want questions

**4. IT'S NOT MY JOB TO EDUCATE YOU** 

I will not reply to idiots who say incel is about sex


I will post these links **here and nowhere else**

What are incel and love-shyness?

Programs for treating incel/love-shyness  http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/867-2/


**5. DON'T BE NONCEL NORMATIVE**

This is slightly trickier because I have yet to make an article on this but not hard at all.

**See things I have to go through/have done in the past not through your eyes of a noncel but through eyes of somebody who has been suffering from incel about 10 years

Now

**6. DON'T POST THREATS**

People who threaten me with dox/police/eternal damnation will be blocked

User EEssentia proposes...
&gt;
&gt;- Collect all heart containers and heart pieces.
&gt;- Collect all upgrades that are not shown in the menu.
&gt;- Collect all 100 Golden Skulltullas.
&gt;- Having each slot in the menu [including inside dungeons] filled with the best possible item that can fit inside that slot [that means collecting the best upgrades
&gt;- Item duplication glitch may not be used.
&gt;- No RBA to acquire not-yet collected items
&gt;- Finish the game! 

What really threw the users of the thread into a kerfuffle was the amount of heart pieces the user should get. (For the record, is 20. An extra quarter heart piece is available, but does not lead to an extra heart.) User *Slowking* suggests...

&gt; That seems to exceed 100% somewhat and gets again into ""defining every little item seperately""-territory

&gt; You need to get 20 hearts. If you use the gerudo heart piece is your thing

But then conflict about the number of heart pieces comes up, the original game developers did not intend for you to do this.

&gt; Should a 100% run collect the Gerudo heart piece that is only accessible as a child? 

...

&gt; &gt;But the question I had, because it's awesome

&gt;Game Shark should never

...

&gt; Maybe because it was relevant to the discussion of 'How do we define 100% for OoT?' - as in 'If you can get more than 20 hearts using glitches

Soon

&gt; If we would start duping hearts I guess we would have to start duping Skulltulas since you can get 255 of them. And oh lord would that be boring to watch. Why dont we just stay inside the boundaries the game originaly gave us?

And that's all the drama thus far.

**Second, free of bigotry and fun. Any undenied privilege will be met with a swift ban. No sexism, ableism, ageism, gingerism, bronyism, commentkarmaism, and cat-owner supremacy is no longer welcome here. Please take this shit to a more lightly-moderated space

/r/Drama's main goal is to cater to off-site drama first and foremost. This means open season on anything dramatic from anywhere on the internet. The caveat with this is that Reddit drama is also welcome

**Dox**. What is and is not dox is decided solely by the admins

**Moderation**. Moderation here will be very loose. As long as a link isn't going to get the admins angry, downvote them, refute them, whatever. The mods here are **not** the morality police. 

**Gossip**. Gossip is awesome. We adore gossip. If you have some juicy gossip, that shit is hilarious. 

**Lolcows**. If you discover someone who is pure internet entertainment, and non-reddit affiliated forum users are okay as long as there are no *real life names*. Facebooks/Twitters should be screenshotted and have all names removed, unless they are a celebrity. 

**Brigades**. Try really super hard to not brigade because it's bad mkay. 

**Rumors**. See Gossip. Same story.

**Other stuff**. Tags

But really! We have had an influx of new users, because super important things are needing to be said!

r/Drama is a drama sub that caters to all forms of drama, to the comment sections of IMDB, we take it all, and we love it. If there is a comment section, there is drama, and we want you to post it here!

While also catering to off-site drama, and general shittery that occurs on Reddit. So feel free to post whatever! 

**Tags:** 
We have them! As a sub that includes offsite drama

[Facebook] / [Twitter] / [Tumblr] / [LOL] (for general drama

Gossip Tags: The gossip tag is for general information, and faux pas that, while not uber dramatic, are of interest to those who keep up with topics of that subject matter - not to mention the meta! A lot of meta happenings on Reddit are considered gossip, and we encourage users to post them!

Rumor tags: We don't really know. It was just funny at the time, just provide context. In the past, rumor tags have been used as ""call-out"" posts to specific users, and that's fabulous, so go wild. 

**Reminder:** Tags used for self posts will change pretty colors! Oh em gee, and provide any context you feel is necessary, just posting the link is great too. 

If your drama is from a website that does not have a tag

**Flairs:** Get one! If you don't like our flairs, we are more than happy to oblige (just nothing pornographic plez).

**IRC:** We have one! It's in our sidebar, pop in and say hi!

**Moderation:** This subreddit is lightly moderated, users are allowed to say anything they want. Just don't be too awful, your karma score will not be happy with you in the morning.

Context: GBFans is a ghostbusters fansite, uniforms, and anything else you can think of (seriously, give the build section a look). People make absolutely astonishing, often screen-accurate replicas of props from the films, cartoon, game

Recasting is basically bootlegging parts made by someone else, and claiming their work as your own (recast parts are usually quite inferior to the original, too). 

The linked forum post is about a pretty notorious recaster named VideoBob. The tl;dr is that a couple of years ago, he's known for making some pretty wild claims, like that he's getting a prop making show on the Discovery Channel, or an exclusive deal with Sony.

As most of you will recall, Reddit CEO, stepped in to clarify the rules surrounding doxxing. [This](http://imgur.com/7oWt3) is a screenshot of the submission by Yishan. He clearly states:

&gt;1. We will ban doxxing posted to reddit.
&gt;2. We will ban links to pages elsewhere which are trivially or primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing (e.g. wikis or blogs primarily including dox).

&gt;**TL;DR: We stand for freedom of speech. We will uphold existing rules against posting dox on reddit. But the reality is those rules end at our platform

This, now we have an example of a similar case, only from the other side of this little gender studies battle. This time, however, the article is removed immediately. No pretense of free speech or removing instances of it being impractical. This time, ""there's no grey line here"".

[This](http://i.imgur.com/8pUzR.png?1) is the conversation I've been having with bitcrunch so far. I am particularly concerned with the apparent unwillingness to give us any firm rules on this matter. Yishan made ""Reddit's"" stance very clear. I have explained that to bitcrunch

In other words, may decide what is considered ""trivial"", or ""primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing"". Yet, inexplicably, the Gawker article did not fall under this definition. [Here's another example](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/15d5rg/big_red_high_school_football_team_raped_girl/).

Apparently John is the only one now that knows how to create this stuff, and goes around carefully giving a cabal of a couple hundred trusted users in Belize a form of this cut with Excedrin, to prevent them from doing too much and raping all the country animals.  He originally posts asking how he can do this process more efficiently, then when users ask how to make this stuff, he posts 3 different versions of how to go about synthesizing it. 

Except only John and his apparent alts can make this magical stuff. Several other users try and fail. [On page 11](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page11)

On [page 12](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page12) is where he is first accused of astroturfing for Am-Hi-Co by lineartransform. This continues on for the rest of the thread. I still don't know if he was actually astroturfing, but if this is astroturfing it makes it readily apparent it is a MDPV derivative, so it doesn't make much sense to me why he would astroturf this product in that manner. 

Regardless

However

&gt; same IP address, live close to each other and magically get the same ""Tan"" product.

in-between is 30 pages of back and forth between users convinced this is a troll, or convinced it somehow will or has worked. Eventually at page 41 the thread is pulled by mods, who still have no idea what is going on. The most likely explanation to me is that John was on a year long MDPV bender and completely lost his mind, convinced he could synth this magical form of MDPV. ",,False,self,1353354999.0,t3_13425c

The initial report of this [caused a bit of a kerfuffle here in r/BJJ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/169kwv/very_disturbing_high_level_bjj_players_caught_on/).

Shortly after that news broke, [was himself involved in a gang rape case over twenty years ago](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/1/10/3856994/team-lloyd-irvin-rape-case). Irvin was acquitted, claiming he had a limp dick and thus couldn't join in, but others who took part in the act were found guilty.

Irvin, and [set up a web site](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/1/11/3864948/mma-bjj-ufc-lloyd-irvin-purchases-lloydirvinrape-marketing) called [LloydIrvinRape.com](http://LloydIrvinRape.com), to promote his upcoming rape prevention seminar (the promotional material has since been removed). To prove to the world that he was doing this out of the goodness of his heart and not as an attempt to push links to these rape cases down the page of web search results, he also [issued a press release via PR Web](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/1/prweb10307266.htm) further promoting his seminar.  Naturally, this all [generated more internet drama](http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=forum.posts&amp;thread=2115573&amp;forum=1&amp;page=1&amp;pc=79), including [a bit on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/16dsg2/well_i_think_im_done_with_all_things_lloyd_irvin/).

These moves by Irvin upset another name in the BJJ community, but had remained silent, wanting to give Irvin ""a fair chance"". But Irvin's actions pushed Jones over the edge, and he set up his own SEO counterattack site, [LloydIrvinRapeExposed.com](http://LloydIrvinRapeExposed.com).

On Friday, and causing a tiny bit of drama in the comments.

And in the latest round of drama surrounding the case, posted a small rant online, defending Irvin.

-----  
On Saturday Nights, but the actual bingo part isn't important at all. What happened after the run started it all.  

RunnerGuy is a big fan of FrankerZ (an e-mote of a dog that has become wildly popular to spam and is associated with ""hype""), and the streamer who is being raided becomes the ""conductor"" who picks the next person for the raid. Runnerguy would direct the train to Twitch users, most of whom were SRL (SpeedRunsLive, a community of speed runners who stream their games live and participate in many races) people and knew about it, in order to see their reactions. Eventually, the train was beginning to run out of SRL people to link to (RunnerGuy wanted to find people who *didn't* know about the FrankerZ train, in order to get a better ""LOL WTF"" reaction), but others were unaffiliated with speed running at all. This is where the problem began.  

Twitch user Crumps2 (a non-speedrunner, and had set-up an anti-spam bot to monitor Crumps2's chat. The bot, however, enacted an incredibly large number of bans so quickly (because the FrankerZ spam came so quickly and in large numbers) that it itself was IP banned for ironically ""spamming"" the chat. Subscriber mode was turned on in the chat, and Crumps2 and Itaku were both visibly angry. Itaku allegedly said that he was going to go through the chat logs and IP ban any user who participated in the spam raid (later clarified by another admin named George that only ASCII art spammers would be banned). Itaku and Crumps2 allegedly used a few slurs against the people from the FrankerZ train in their rage, and Crumps2 laughed at the raid by telling them it was only going to raise his viewer count to the point where he could apply for Twitch partner. The combination of the bans, alleged use of slurs, and many took to RunnerGuy's (now empty

Now it gets even crazier. A lot of mud was slinged around, and tells people to report Itaku ON STREAM. The admin named George shows up and turns on subscriber mode on Pie's stream to have a direct conversation with him as well as the other SRL runners on Pie's chat. I'll try and sum up the arguments both sides made here:  

FrankerZ Train/Speed Runners:

1) IP banning was a disproportionate reaction to the FrankerZ train.  
2) FrankerZ train was friendly
3) FrankerZ train exposes viewers to new streamers.  

Crumps2/Itaku:  

1) It was unnecessary spam
2) Caused chat servers to slow down
3) Raiders broke the streamer's chat rules.  

Both sides kept to their own chats

Looking for a place to vent without fucking up other subreddits with my stupid bullshit. Here's what happened:

Old friend from highschool.  I took him in rent free when he called me up crying one day.  He was scared he would be killed.  Apparently he was squatting in a house in an urban area with a bunch of other people and they got violent with him.

Fast forward six months to the present.  He's living in my living room.  He's a hoarder.  Unclean.  Smokes weed and sleeps constantly.  Kind of crazy, started yelling at me.  I told him not to do this, and demanded an apology, told him I wouldn't leave the living room, which is technically his room, until he calmed down talked to me.  I was also concerned because the dude was suicidal, and I had had to take his prescription medicine away from him.  I wasn't sure what state of mind he was in, and long story short I broke his nose.  I offered to take him to the hospital but he was still being completely irrational and abusive.  He took the bus.  He's there now

The core of all of it is sad - vulnerable people were sexually abused

The drama comes from the way the abuse allegations were revealed.  This is complicated

**1) Jimmy Saville OBE (now dead).**

Jimmy Saville was a popular radio DJ and TV personality.  ""Jim'll Fix It"" was a much loved tv show.  He did a lot of work for charity.  When he died the BBC had a set of commemorative programmes about him.

There had been long running rumours in the industry that Saville had been an unpleasant man, ""NewsNight"") had investigated, and came to the conclusion that he was a child abuser.  That programme was not shown; BBC bosses cancelled it.  

Some time later another programme on the competing ITV network did their own investigation into Saville.  They decided he was a serial abuser.

(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9580096/Jimmy-Savile-Questions-about-why-BBC-dropped-Newsnight-investigation.html)

(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9577087/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-ITV-goes-where-BBC-fears-to-tread.html)

Here's where a lot of drama explodes - why the hell didn't anyone say anything?  Why were the victims ignored? How much did the BBC know? (BBC have a yearly charity drive called ""Children in Need""; they banned Saville from any involvement because they didn't like the allegations.) etc etc.

The BBC then do a programme (using their flagship documentary ""Panorama"") about what went wrong at ""Newsnight"".  

More victims come forward.

More stories are heard.

It turns out that this man was evil and he abused very many people over very many years.  He may be one of the UK's most prolific sex offenders.

Bizarrely this radio and tv personality was invited into a high security psychiatric hospital

So far it's all pretty shitty for the BBC - many people lost their jobs.

**2) North Wales Children's Homes**

And then there's some separate allegations about abuse in Children's home in Wales.  These were serious allegations and nothing much was done and there was an investigation at the time

A victim says he was abused by (at the time) a senior tory politician

Turns out that when the victim was originally interviewed by police

Twitter is abuzz - who is this politician?  A name is found.

The Prime Minister appears on a breakfast TV show

Very great harm is done to this man

That innocent man is now going after people who tweeted or re-tweeted his name.  Regular people are being asked to pay £5 to a children's charity.  Celebs will be asked to pay much more.  The BBC has already had to pay £187

But hey, consistent moderating decisions but hey, it's *something*. 

While all this was going on, where this mod started verbally abusing me in modmail when I tried to find out why one of my submissions has been removed. 

I, if a mod is acting like a five year old, I won't come down to their level). I complained to grozzle about the abuse in modmail (and obvious bias of one of the mods) and he said that modmail verbal abuse is apparently acceptable, that a mod shouldn't treat a polite subscriber as a human being. So now, as I tried to explain how illogical *that* was, the other two mods of the sub apparently got mad that they had to perform their mod duties (answer modmail) and now consider me a troll, even though all I've tried to do is have a polite conversation about one or two of my removed submissions in /awwnime. They've also somehow convinced some of the regulars in the sub that I'm a troll as well

SickLaxBro is one of a handful of players that have started playing there, SickLaxBro managed to kill Tigrr, who was in full iron armor at the time, with his bare fists, and this prowess for PvP will become relevant later on.

Fast forward a week or so and things are going fine, it seemed that SickLaxBro's farm was lava griefed by Paradox (once again the admin of the server) and Tigrr. SickLaxBro, for some odd reason angered by the destruction of his wheat, vows vengeance and, over the course of the next 3 hours, goes about killing and griefing (from my count, he killed every member of Ft.

~~LH is currently none too happy about his shadow ban for something ""that was not dox""~~ and in a flurry of rage and tin foil hats

**Removed post text**:

&gt;I have been with LeftoNhahe in private modmail for a while. Some other users from this sub are in there too. Very recently we had a minor leak: /u/LeftonHahe [3] admitted that he is in Game of Dolls and HarrietPotter is a good friend of him in real life. He said he was the leaker.
His opinion on this is: 'I am a good mod, he's playing buddy with people like /u/Laurelai [-30][4] in a private sub. He's been friends with HarrietPotter before he even was made mod. Look at the age of his account. I won't leak modmail conversation, but believe me if I say this: a lot of other people in there were and still are pissed off at him. They lost /r/antisrs[5] over bullshit like this, I myself wasn't there at the time so I couldn't give my opinion, I just enjoyed the popcorn.
The reason why I got banned: we were having fun with /u/lolsail [+2][6] . I found a picture of him that he posted in /r/mildlyinteresting[7] . He said he was okay if I posted a link to it, he made it to be doxx by stating that he wants it removed from reddit. So I did. I removed every picture of user /u/lolsail [+2][10] , even though he thought it was funny: Okay, I actually laughed at that one.
Reddibots still has the old screen containing the links to the pictures. What funny was: he even posted a 'better' picture of him where we could see his Edward Scissorhands haircut (I'm not kidding). He was perfectly fine with everything at the time. We were having a laugh. He even thanked me in PM. Now this is where it comes together. I know /u/LeftoNhahe [11] is in /r/gameofdolls[12] , but we both know you aren't and they will never give you juicy information. You are being played by harrietpotter because you're gullible, someone in modmail even compared you with an Aspie (not me this time, but it was funny as hell). The reason for his friendship with her: 'I was feeling very bad at a time in my life when broke up with a girl. HarrietPotter was there for me. She was very supportive and I like her as a friend. We even watch youtube together over skype.'
Guess who else is in /r/gameofdolls[13] ? /u/Lolsail [14] . Not only him but a lot of people you don't want to be associated with:
/u/cojoco [+2][15]
/u/Laurelai [-30][16]
/u/anguilax [17] (HarrietPotter)
/u/brucemo [18] (aSRS mod under different nick)
etc.
People in modmail asked /u/LeftoNhahe [19] to make a screenshot of all the mods and regulars there. He didn't do it. But he's a good mole right?
TL;DR: /u/lolsail [+2][20] and /u/LeftoNhahe [21] are in /r/gameofdolls[22] together with some despicable people like /u/Laurelai [-30][23] and /u/HarrietPotter [24] . I have reason to believe that they massively reported me and /u/ss2james [25] to the admins over something that wasn't even doxx.

Edit 2 : Spaceball deleted the comment. For those that don't have unedit reddit it said 

&gt;This is all conveniently set up to make me look like an asshole, you heard that right, a fucking trivia channel) AS A JOKE which is (was) the only irc channel I had ops in. BipolarBear0 was wasted tonight (which he admitted) and didn't like my joke so he went on a childish rampage and caused what you see. When I kickbanned him (once again, as a joke) he got so raging mad that he removed my flags in that channel and stopped talking to me, like a petulant child. So there's your drama. Talk to him, because lord knows, he won't talk to me anymore. This is so funny.

He also replied to u/nidderfaddit with the following 

&gt;I need to clear something up. I was not crying about +v. Somehow, when do I get my v"" and it was totally a joke because +v means absolutely nothing in irc. So Bear gave me +v and I was like ""hey, you know what, I don't want v unless &lt;this other guy&gt; gets v because I think he's cool. This was all just normal irc joking but then people started accusing me of taking +v too seriously and when I defended myself I was accused of taking everything too seriously and before you knew it, you had drunk irc ops acting like douches and making me look bad because they didn't get jokes. Guys, I was kidding. And when I said I was kidding everyone said ""NO WAY YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE"" and I never recovered. I'm still confused. *edit and I think BipolarBear0 doesn't like me anymore because I spent a couple of minutes telling the channel how much of a fucking drunk douche he was being, which is true and I don't take it back. He admitted he was wasted on Jameson and that always makes for bad moderating but whatever

1353041006.0,13a7j1,Tumblr Male vs. Female Privilege Drama.  Featuring several Tumblrs over a four month period!,moraigeanta,6,2,4,"So

The Tumblr battle begins four months ago when opposing Tumblrs [All About Male Privilege](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com) and [this is female privilege](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com) come into existence.  The opposing forces will be referred to as AMP and TMP respectively because I am lazy.  Both blogs are submission based

AMP kicks off with a positively received [first post](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/26573746446/male-privilege-1#notes).  TMP, attracting 187 notes and confusion over whether the blog is serious or not.  

TMP quickly gains both [fans](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27019815604/im-a-girl-and-honestly-when-i-see-people-talking) and [enemies](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27021884958/your-mother-is-ashamed), with most of its early detractors [angry about the WNBA](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/26662225435/i-forgot-that-when-only-3-000-people-show-up-to-watch).  Both continue to receive a fair amount of fan/hate mail up to the present day.

AMP and TMP finally cross paths with [this post about feminism](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27261315282/actually)
