Please feel free to ask me anything.

But first

There have been a lot of stories flying around about why I am shadow-banned and the simple, along with their actual pictures. I wanted Redditors to be extra careful so that no harm ever comes to them in real life.

I then logged into my Gmail yesterday where the Admin /u/Dacvak had a conversation with me. This is the full

Full screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/rz41P.png

The reason why Dacvak shadow banned me is because 'I created drama within 24 hours' and that is all. I was banned minutes after that conversation ended.

Dacvak

&gt; ""There are actually a lot of rules that we (the admins) recently found out when we investigated his (PIMA's) account that he had broken. The most recent one was creating a subreddit that disregarded the rules of reddit regarding sexualizing teens/minors

There are three things to say about this (the last one being the absolute most important). Firstly

&gt; ""The most recent one was creating a subreddit that disregarded the rules of reddit regarding sexualizing teens/minors

This is a complete lie. I was not creating any subreddit that disregarded the rules and Dacvak's lie is obvious. If I was allegedly creating a Reddit that sexualised minors

Then would I still have my account if I HAD been active in moderating the posts? 

But of course

And secondly

Alot of you will remember a subreddit called /r/Xsmall that was banned by the Admins because CP was being posted and there was only one moderator for the subreddit. [The saga can be read here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/wnxj2/rxsmall_has_been_incorrectly_banned/)

This moderator was /u/baconfan... who still has his account.

By that logic, and nor should it, because this is all fiction by Dacvak.

And now, regarding this comment by Dacvak:

&gt; ""There are actually a lot of rules that we (the admins) recently found out when we investigated his (PIMA's) account that he had broken.""

Really?

Funny

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/G6lBJ.png

Amazing how things change in the matter of a few days

No doubt you are going to say these screenshots are edited too, please select a Redditor who is respected and trustworthy...

**AND I WILL GIVE THEM THE PASSWORD TO MY GMAIL ACCOUNT SO THEY CAN VERIFY THE TRUTH OF THESE CHAT RECORDS**

I really do not care what happens to me, but when the community manager himself is openly distorting the truth just to cover his own tracks, then... well, what is there to say?

And to other Redditors I ask you this much

PLEASE STAY SAFE WHEN POSTING ON NSFW SUBREDDITS.

You have all heard about what has happened, and even, in some cases, if your comments are spun out of context and deliberately misinterpreted.

I couldn't give a damn about my account and being shadow-banned. But I DO give a damn about peoples safety

Again... I am happy to hand over the password to a respected Redditor who can verify the chats I had with Dacvak.",,t5_2v33w,1350139705.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11eydk/i_am_potato_in_my_anus_shadowbanned_by_the_lying/

I definitely *do* know how to make bots because I made this one and it's been running smoothly for 10 months as of today (it went live Jan 1st

qkme_transcriber is a bot that posts transcriptions of Quickmeme.com links ([like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1268vy/my_girlfriend_says_im_too_shy_online/c6si2eg?context=3)).

The bot has a [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/comments/o426k/faq_for_the_qkme_transcriber_bot/) and a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/qkme_transcriber/).

Admins are saying I accepted payment from a spammer named poweromania and that I never reported it. Unfortunately for them

The thing that I think stinks about this is that the admins have taken multiple hours out of their days to take punitive action against me and other mods for completely false accusations and simply won't take any time to remove illegal or questionable material that I report to them. 

Over the last few months I have reported multiple instances of illegal or questionable material to the admins and they have simply ignored all of my messages. They also refuse to remove the URLs as you can see here: http://i.imgur.com/s7bn9.png

Admins are the only ones who can *delete* those URLs, Reddit admin cannot be bothered to take 5 extra seconds to delete this link and protect children that are being abused. They would rather punish myself and my 2 co-mods and accuse us of something we absolutely never did. 

I have to step away for a few minutes but please ask any questions and I will respond when I return.

I hate flounces and long goodbyes, and I have registered /u/PreviouslySaydrah in case I want to pop in verifiably as myself and comment if people mention me or something. It's just time to move on from this account and go back to enjoying Reddit as a source of interesting links and a place to occasionally comment if I have something of value to say. I have some alts that I used in the past that I'll probably pick up again. It's really more enjoyable just being a Redditor than being a recognizable name here. Maybe I'll start doing the thing where you delete your account every six months. I don't really know--I just know I've been thinking for a long time about this and I came to the conclusion that it's time to make a change. The VA incident did influence me, but only by a couple months--I was originally planning to do this on 12/12/12, just for giggles.

Hey guys, The Ohio State University Marching Band.

Some Proof: http://i.imgur.com/bD8Pe.jpg
These are just the parts of my uniform I had within easy reach. There are quite a few more that aren't pictured.

Although this last halftime in the Nebraska game was among the best shows we've ever done, though the music is hard to hear. In any case, it's definitely worth looking up some of our other shows: while some may have stood out, they've all been excellent.

The band actually has a social media clause, I don't really expect that to be a problem.

Enough about me. The comments I've seen all over the web about this show and about us have shown me that there are a whole lot of misconceptions about the show and about marching band in general(including our band). 
TL;DR Ask me anything about the show, video games and basically anything else. I'll be back around noon to start answering any questions you guys have, and I'll be here basically as long as you ask me questions; we have practice off for today.

I deleted my main account in protest of recent actions by the admins, starting with ""Gawkergate"" and leading to the recent shadowbanning of Scopolamina, AMAA.",168,"I'd like to begin by sharing some personal details about my life outside of reddit. My name is Sean, she spent a lot of time with her mother

I teach an after-school and summer program for predominantly low-income K-8th grade student, but it has completely changed my outlook on life and I absolutely love it. I have learned so much about early childhood development and specifically how children learn and how wording things a certain way or in a certain tone of voice can have a dramatic effect on how a child understands what you are trying to teach them that I feel I am even a better father as a result. I feel like I am actually making the world a better place one child at a time and it's the first time in my life that I actually feel satisfied with myself at the end of the work day. I'm often amazed I ended up in this position, considering that I come from a conservative Christian household and my father loathed teachers and psychologists because he believed they were indoctrinating the population with ""the liberal agenda."" I was fed a steady stream of Fox News growing up, and as a result I was a good little republican just like the rest of my family. It seems strange to distinctly remember feeling that liberal politicians were actually *evil* and literally doing the work of the Devil. My father actually believes that Obama is the antichrist... I'm not joking.

My experience on reddit has changed my political beliefs dramatically, I realize how dangerous corporate influence in politics can be. I'm not extremely outspoken politically or active in local politics at all, but I do vote regularly, and I am grateful for Obamacare, considering my wife and I are currently living without insurance and I haven't been to a regular doctor in years (I go to a low-cost local clinic when I am sick). Thankfully my daughter qualifies for free health insurance from the state, or I would be forced to quit the job I love and get a higher-paying job, and since I don't have a college degree, unskilled manual labor, I mean, full-time job

I would like to go back to school and pursue a career in education. I would like to be a middle school science teacher, if my workload allows.

My dream job would be working in social media or an online university, higher education will be entirely free and available to everyone. I could never relocate out of state, though, so I think pursuing a teaching career at a nearby local school is my best option. Both my family and my wife's family live within 30 minutes driving distance, and while I am not particularly close with my family (I'm definitely closer with my sister and my grandmother than I am with my father or my uncle, for example), my wife is completely inseparable from hers. She has a large family and we have family get-togethers very frequently, and they all absolutely love Kylie

Well, so here's some additional information about my online activity over the years:

* [Here is a link to my stattit.com profile.](http://stattit.com/user/syncretic/)
* [Here is a link to my karmawhores.net page.](http://www.karmawhores.net/user/syncretic)
* [Here is a link to my hubski 'hub'
* [Here is a link to my Flickr profile.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/syncretic) Not relevant to reddit

* [Here is a link to every submission that mentioned me in /r/SubredditDrama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=syncretic&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)

I have an account on several private bittorrent trackers, depending on how aggressively the individual trackers prohibit mentioning them elsewhere on the internet. My username on all of them is ""syncretic,"" though, so if you're involved in the private tracker community, it's not hard to find me. I'm on most of the big ones.

When I was a teenager I was heavily involved with the ""warez scene"" on Efnet and Linknet. This was during 2000-2004, really bloomed during the peak of Napster, and then when Napster got shut down I was really hungry for more free music online, which lead me to dcc servers on efnet irc, which put me in contact with people who were actively involved in the larger mp3 scene groups. I started out making ""Tuesday runs,"" which basically involved waking up early on a Tuesday and buying some new album from some new or obscure band, you know, and I have access to more now than I could have ever imagined during my stint in the irc scene. The cloud really is the future of online media.

Let's see

That about sums it up, my involvement with private torrent trackers (although I still won't mention any tracker names, just basic info about private trackers in general), and my experience in social media, specifically moderating large subreddits, creating new communities and my decision to delete my account in protest to recent admin actions (and inactions) and use hubski as my preferred link aggregator. I reserve the right to ignore questions about my personal life, but feel free to ask anyway, but I do prefer to leave my real life separate from my online life, my family,

If you've ever tried to learn how to play guitar on the internet

When I first signed on with Expert Village (before they got bought out by Demand Media), we survived the how-to market boom and bust and have been working on a project called HowToPlayAnySong  for the last few years. Which, of course, is why I'm here.

We've been working our hot little asses off at HTPAS  and we're pretty excited about our fresh re-launch. We've worked with a lot of talented people and been through some ups and downs so we're proud to go live again. Check it out
My areas of expertise are obviously guitar, and music culture, but I'd love to hear your thoughts and discussions on internet marketing, internet culture, content farms, how lame the internet how-to industry is, and online education.

I made most of those gifs. Not all of them. They were made with a really awesome gif editor that I found a long time ago and now don't remember what it was now that I know how to ~pirate full versions of stuff~.

This was before the social networking boom- pictures on profiles were still fairly uncommon. I entered a relationship under the Punkboy alias with a very troubled girl. She was morose and suicidal. Our relationship lasted for a year or two
My second ""catfishing"" incident happened in my first year of high school. Feeling confused by the new social pool, I was exposed. Luckily, I was already transferring into a different school.
The most recent incident is my worst yet. I began to log onto a lesbian chat site after taking a hiatus from college. I used pictures of a girl that I knew. She was attractive but not enough to cause suspicion. I made up fantastical lies- I was a drug dealer, with ""popular"" users. I became a popular member, with a reputation for shit talking and ""fucking over bitches."" I soon created yet another profile. Again, a picture of a girl I knew vaguely, attractive but not alarmingly so. She quickly became known as the Internet ""slut"". Nicknamed the ""Phonebone Queen"". I developed her personality even more- she had a child, she was abused, she was an ex-stripper, I killed her off
Anyway, because on the surface I am extremely social and outgoing. I was somewhat of a legend at my college. I have plenty of friends. I am gay, with plenty of prospects. I am known for being ""hilarious"". I am overweight, but good-looking. I am intelligent. I don't understand why I do the things that I do. I don't understand why I ""catfish"". I have turned this over in my mind endlessly. My own theory is that I have too much time on my hands, too little stimulation, and an imagination that runs rampant. I enjoyed weaving storylines, creating and playing characters. I enjoyed the drama, arguments
I've also thought about the term ""Catfish"" quite a bit. I know the term was inspired by a quote from the movie: 
""They used to tank cod from Alaska all the way to China. They’d keep them in vats in the ship. By the time the codfish reached China, they keep you thinking, they keep you fresh. And I thank god for the catfish because we would be droll, boring and dull if we didn't have somebody nipping at our fin.""
But I don't agree with that definition. I think it's a great term with a rather stupid explanation.  I don't see us ""Catfish"" as prodding any sort of growth or quick thought along. 
We ""Catfish"" are indeed predators
Species of catfish are primarily bottom-feeders and scavengers. Their existence falls better in line with the online Catfish.
Online Catfish are scavengers. We take the pieces of different lives to form our own stories. We accept the hollow imitation of life and love that we have created. We are content to live in the dead skin of another.
We are cloaked by murky waters. If you're lucky enough to pull us out

One interesting experience: I did Disney's VMK obsessively for a while, I really don't recall any kinds of stalkerish activities. 

Starting early 2010, mainly /b/. In May 2010, I started drawfagging under the name ""Rin"" (which is where my username now is derived from). I was there when multiple drawfags were banned for no reason, myself being one of them. ...Though I've honestly backed out on that community due to 1) drama that I ended up fueling and 2) lack of motivation. Also a broken tablet replaced by a shitty tablet. That would do it. I still keep in touch with some of them via tumblr and Facebook, though. 

Since then, I've taken a hiatus on regular usage of tumblr due to how shitty the community is. 

Nowadays I haven't been doing much, Sociology, and Communications. So I have a lot to say about different online communities, now that I know how to approach them with an unbiased point of view, and with often first-hand experience and engagement. 

I also play Dota 2 and Guns of Icarus Online on a regular basis. I consider myself an egalitarian-based/cyber-/post-structural/intersectionalist feminist. (In other words, and study feminism in the context of the Internet and computer science.)

I've recently started making mainly gaming videos that aren't the generic call of duty montages with dubstep in the background or overdone minecraft bollocks

A lot of people have said to me that I deserve a lot more popularity than I get and this AMA totally isn't a publicity stunt at all... ppssshhhhttt.
