It's used to reverse engineer executables and according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_pro) there is a plugin which can decompile c/c++ executables. This is the free version. I'm not really sure which features are missing or if they are important. Probably depends on what you want to do.

These xrays would be much more useful to the vet if he could email them around to specialists

There is no technical support for this machine


I've had a few attempts now of trying to decode the image formats

* Each xray taken has several files associated; DBU, STS, HIS, IMG, MSK, PRL and RED
* Only three files look like images with any amount of data: IMG
* The MSK looks like a bit mask
* The IMG is a thumbnail of the full resolution image. It is a plain greyscale bitmap. A basic header with dimensions and 8 bits per pixel.
* The PYR is the unknown format, but couldn't figure it out enough to convert into an actual image.


Here are the source image sets:

* Set 1: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/AGFA_REDDIT_SET_1.rar (3MB)
* Set 2: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/AGFA_REDDIT_SET_2.rar (24MB), entirely white image)


I'm hoping Reddit will be able to help me figure out the format of the PYR's. They don't look compressed
Sorry for the long post below


---
This is what I know of the **AGFA header**

* 32 bytes of ascii header format identifier. Always ""AGFA MEDICAL IMAGING #0001"".
* 4 bytes of ascii filetype identifier. Can be ""IMG""
* 4 byte integer
* 4 byte integer
* 4 byte integer
* 4 byte integer
* 4 byte integer


**IMG file format:**

* After the basic header
* Converter cpp code: http://jebus.geek.nz/xray/img2png.cpp


**PYR file format:**

The PYR header has 3 more 'blocks' in it than the IMG

    unknown_1 = 5
    unknown_2 = 5 (header blocks?)
    data_content = 4
    width = 2040
    height = 2570
    unknown_3 = 274
    unknown_4 = 274
    unknown_5 = 843
    unknown_6 = 3358
    unknown_7 = 3
    unknown_8 = 13
    triplet_1_1 = (pointer)0x42AA2F73 = (int)1118449523
    ??? = (float) ???
    triplet_1_2 = 0x416c34bb = (int)1097610427
    triplet_1_3 = 0x40D92B78 = (int)1087974264
    triplet_2_1 = 0x3F477121 = (int)1061646625
    triplet_2_2 = 0x3F30B659 = (int)1060157017
    triplet_2_3 = 0x3f0a3715 = (int)1057634069
    unknown_9 = 0x4012F1AA = (int)1074983338

I can calculate some values from this:

    width*height = 5
    actual_filesize(disk) = 4
    actual_filesize-pixel_count = 372 = non_data_size
    header_size = 320
    null_footer = 52 bytes
    header_size+null_footer = 372 = non_data_size

In all PYR images of size 2570x2040

    0x140 to 0x35a0e = 219
    0x35a0e to 0x445acc = 4
    style1 and style2 are multiple of 16
    style1 seems to be 16 bit aligned

PYR files of pixel size 2570x2040 are 4375KB

I just GPLed a project of mine I've been working on for a while now named rdis. This is a binary analysis tool for linux. It is in a semi-form of completion

[Website](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/) - [Screenshot](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/ss18nov2012.png) - [Github](https://github.com/endeav0r/rdis)

Rdis does not *currently* debug executables. I'll comment more on that if there's interest.

While rdis currently supports ELF/PE 32/64-bit x86

Reachable functions (I'm betting someone will ask) are functions which rdis believes are currently reachable. I implemented this after disassembling Go binaries which statically link their standard libraries and provide symbols for each function. Instead of searching through every function in the binary

*My main goal behind releasing rdis is feedback. Please let me know what you think (post-runtime). Consider it a transaction

**Other notes:**

* Click on an instruction in the graph and hit semi-colon. You are now typing a comment for that instruction. Return ends the comment input.

* Click on a node/vertex in the graph. Hit 'p'. Predecessor nodes/vertices are highlighted.

* The first window you are looking at when running rdis accepts lua. Incomplete lua documentation available [here](http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/lua.html) . Rdis will look for and run ~/.rdis.lua each time you load an executable.

* You won't be able to save executable loaded with a lua loader. This will have to wait until I find a way to package the lua code used to load the executable in with the saved rdis state.

* Rdis saves its state in JSON

* From the hex view,"" to tell rdis to recursively disassemble from that byte. This is also available from instructions in the graph.

* Call graphs for functions are available from the menu on right clicking a function in the function view.

* References are built at runtime by map/reducing over the graphs holding instructions. c: is for constant, so this information is only complete for the independent instruction in which the address was found.

* Rdis is threaded. Your cores will help. It also makes healthy use of memory. The beefier your machine

*I've added some basic documentation to the rdis site which covers most of the details above: http://rainbowsandpwnies.com/rdis/docs.html*",,t5_2qmd0,1356625240.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/158xy8/rdis_a_binary_analysis_tool_for_linux/

If so

I believe what's needed are many more people teaching trainings in person, and results in the education of many more people. If you're a person who already knows the material, becoming an instructor should be a snap. All you need are class materials, and a venue. Finding venues is up to the instructors, but now there is a place that lesson plans and class materials can be stored:

www.OpenSecurityTraining.info

This site is meant to act as a repository for class material that have been used in computer security classes at least a day long. The material must be released under an open license to allow the most possible instructors to utilize and adapt the material. It can then be used by new instructors as-is

But we need more content, please consider contributing it. And if you're one of the people who already knows a great deal of the material currently posted there, please start thinking about how you could take the material and start teaching others in person, at your job, at conferences, or elsewhere. For more about why you should contribute, and why you should teach

It is not common that I find these so I've never had the opportunity to really dive deeply into one. Hopefully someone finds some interest. Thank you!

`bp` is used like this in calculations `WORD PTR [bp+0x0]`.

**Please correct my following assumptions:**

 * The `cmp sp

 * I assume that DOS loads the binary and places the *command line arguments* behind the code segment? Maybe at `0x00000052` is `argc` and beginning with `0x0000005d` is `argv[]`?

 * I assume that DOS makes a data segment available for the code at `0x00000152` which can be used to read and write data.

 * This is an instruction in the code `lods ax

I thought CreateRemoteThread() works pretty much all the time, no matter what.

What I'm exactly trying to do is injecting a DLL in a hooked CreateProcess function. I know Detours offers CreateProcessWithDll

So I'm stuck with homemade solutions. Googling suggested using WaitForInputIdle() for GUI processes to make it work

My current approach: CreateProcess(CREATE_SUSPENDED), I suspend the main thread, inject my DLL, restore the OEP and call ResumeThread. In theory this works, but for one reason or another, UPX-notepad wins again.

Any ideas?

Edit: I feel stupid, find out the OEP, write EB FE and let it run. This enables Windows to do its initialization. A generous Sleep(1000) later, the process should be looping as fast as it can. I then inject a LoadLibrary into the running process, suspend the thread, restore the OEP, call FlushInstructionCase() on it so there are no cache-related errors and then I resume the thread,,True,t3_fhyzh

If you're looking for a new job in kernel programming

If you want marketing cheese about our competitive salaries, I've got that.

And here's some of the job

* Triage and analyze binary code to determine its functionality and purpose

* Perform dynamic and static analysis of malicious binaries to determine its characteristics

* Learn new platforms

* Automate the analysis of malicious code

* Develop new malicious code analysis and detection tools.

But really

1347154390.0,zkzae,Help parsing raw binary data from magnetic credit card strip?,IanCormac,36,8,16,"I recently got one of those nifty Square credit card readers for iPhone (they're free) that allow you to use your iDevice as a credit card point of sale device. What's great is that these devices are super simple; just a coil and a resistor that go to the iPhone's microphone line. The movement of the credit card induces a current in the coil

Now, it's easy to see the binary data. I wrote some sweet code that automatically detects the ""bitrate"" (which can change depending on swipe speed) and converts the audio data to binary, as well as some other nifty stuff. As far as I can tell, my code works very well. The results correspond with what I see in audacity. There is only minimal error in between swipes (which would probably be fixed by error checking algorithms in a real reader, or maybe more complex sampling algorithms)

Even when I swipe different cards and do a visual diff of the results

What I noticed was that the similarities in the data from different cards occur in multiples of 7 bits. This leads me to believe that I am reading track 1 of the card, some are odd. Track 1 is supposed to be odd parity. I tried shifting all 7-bit values by 1-6 bits (in case I dropped some bits somewhere), but this still didn't make it proper parity.

I also tried searching for individual letters (from my name), I also tried shifting all 7-bit values. Also tried flipping byte order, polarity, etc. but with no success.

So

**I think I'm getting accurate binary data from a credit card

Anyone have any advice or experience?

Also

**EDIT: Looks like the square readers might have recently been given built-in encryption hardware. Thanks for the tip torvold. I will take a look into that.**
It looks like there is some juicy microcontroller business going on in the Square readers now

The encryption being used doesn't seem to be very strong (extremely low or no cascade effect

**EDIT 2/3: I am making some good headway with the audio port protocol. I've figured out the encoding scheme, with what may be a randomly generated password. Every time I swipe the card there are a few small sections of data and one big section of data that is different. There are also a few sections that stay the same for any given card, so I know I'm reading it correctly. Anyway, it looks like some card details are sent cleartext, some encrypted. Figuring out the encryption is on the todo list.**",,False,t5_2qmd0,True

Don't get me wrong, how to bypass ASLR or maybe DEP etc. The thing is, these are technical details and I've probably read 400 papers on how to overwrite the return address in the numerous exploitation papers/tutorials but this is not what I'm interested in. I've done reverse engineering and understand how BO and the rest of the usual suspects work, but I don't know how to do anything with my knowledge.

Is there anything that might go into detail regarding the actual workflow? I've read others sometimes grep sources for something, maybe some paper/video of another beginner that explains how he found an actual vulnerablity (maybe wrote a fuzzer)?

My try at an analogy: It seems like everyone is teaching me how to build a motorcycle, this is what matters and I'm having a hard time applying all the theoretical things I know.

Maybe someone has some links to hook me up

I had to manually set my `vm.mmap_min_addr` to 0 using `sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0` and I tried to figure out kernel symbol information using root privileges.

    $ sudo grep prepare_kernel /proc/kallsyms
    c10761f0 T prepare_kernel_cred

    $ sudo grep commit_creds /proc/kallsyms
    c1075f80 T commit_creds

Now I have a couple of questions at this point: -

 1. `rasm2 -a x86 ""call 0xc10761f0""` gives me ""e8eb6107c1"". Why is it not ""e8f06107c1""? The case is similar with the address for commit_creds.
 2. When I wrote the exploit I noted that using ""e8eb6107c1"" always ended up jumping to ""prepare_kernel_cred+5"", why is it that I dont have to adjust the address of `commit_creds`

I considered asking this at SO but then couldnt find an 'exploit' tag

We live in Portugal and our town has it's own bus system and they use RFID for the tickets (magnetic tickets were replaced recently).

Our plan is to understand how this system works

Right now we're at information gathering stage and we need to learn everything we can before we jump right into it.

**Information about the tickets**

- Rechargeable (if we need more rides they recharge the ticket

**What we want**

- Read and decrypt the information (all the ticket content
- Modify the information on the ticket (add more trips
- Clone a ticket

**What we need to know**

- How can we detect the ticket frequency?
- How to know the tag (Mifare
- Ignoring the frequency, etc...)
- After we got the frequency

Hope you guys can give me some information


**PICS! (behind light)**

As you can see


------------------------------ **EDIT** ------------------------------

Good news everyone! So we found out that my town's bus system publishes a monthly magazine and in one of them they explain how the system works!

**Protocol:** ISO 14443B

**Frequency:** 13.56MHz

Tag: It might be Calypso............ :(

They have two types of tickets: a personal ticket

**Under the Hood**

* PoS: There are stores across the city where we can acquire and recharge the tickets.

* Inside the bus: there's also a PoS working the same way as the stores. The on board ticketing system connects with the geo location system to acquire data about all the tickets inside that specific bus. The information acquired on board is automatically collected, operational, statistics...). Using the same communication method, information about rates, users etc.. is sent to the on-board system.

* Central System: system with high availability (24x7). The database contains all the necessary information for operational, auditing, maintenance management, complaint management and fraud management. ",,False,,1341528380.0,t3_w0frc

* *how do you pick your target?*

Reward programs such as [ZDI](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/) and [EIP](https://www.exodusintel.com/eip/) are not clearly stating as to what products to aim for. Surely we can deduce a bit from the published advisories

I see two flavours of targets:

* Browsers and their addons/extensions (such as Flash/Shockwave)
* Others

Especially the latter category is huge. Without any evidence and just based on gut feeling I feel that programs such as MS Word/Excel/PDF readers are targeted by allot of researchers. I'd rather go for some less known products

* *which ones?*
* *Am I seeing monsters under the bed by thinking the odds of submitting a duplicate bug in those big programs is high?*
* *How often did you experience this?* 


**Slightly unrelated to the original question**

Anyone followed one of these courses/workshops and willing to share their experience? What was your entry level knowledge wise? What did you learn/gain most from it?

Just got around to looking at the docs again and it looks like the picoChip baseband processor is based on the ARM 926EJ-S processor

I've tested the resistance from Vss to various JTAG I/Os and this [photo](http://i.imgur.com/fljbN.jpg) is my guess of the JTAG pins.  The resistance information was based on the presentation by Gerrit van der Bij

&gt; •JTAG only has one output pin.
&gt; 
&gt; –The TDO pin: when JTAG is inactive
&gt; 
&gt; –The resistance of the driver transistors when they are NOT driven is very large (&gt;10MΩ) to both power supply and ground.
&gt; 
&gt; •JTAG has 3 ""interesting"" input pins.
&gt; 
&gt; –To prevent drifting voltages on these pins

It looks like a PCB pads for a regular 14-pin header socket found on some ARM-based boards.

Gonna get some newer USB JTAG connector to see if this is correct.  The [Segger J-Link EDU](http://www.segger.com/cms/j-link-edu.html) seems cool and is [pretty cheap](http://www.segger-us.com/jlinkjtagemulator.htm)

Two visible screws on the bottom

Once you're in, all giving out TTL voltages. I couldn't have done it without the help from [this tutorial over at dev/ttys/0](http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/).

So the pins in order from RJ45 connector to the LEDs are [VCC, Gnd].

I hooked up a cheap $9 UART I got off of eBay, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits... seems standard. Anyhow, I logged my putty connection and was excited to get some output: http://pastebin.com/ScQ1YaP6

Now, and you would see the change in voltage on the multimeter. However, after a point in time the tx line will just stay at a constant 1.625v (This could be off, I forget where I write things). So this lead me to test two.

Test two was the putty-paste test, and loaded my clipboard with ""paste!\n"", with the \n not being literal of course. So I plugged in the modem and to my hearts content I right clicked that putty window, pasting input as quick as I could. What I found was input is allowed after 

    line 135: Freeing init memory: 76K

until the ending line.

I tried running processes

    echo `cat /etc/passwd &gt; /dev/tts/0` &gt;&gt; /etc/scripts/z_arris_check.sh

I've tried, my adventure (this is my first adventure with embedded device RE-ing), and hopefully I can get some feedback or insight where to head next.

Long story short

I'm the creator of the persistent COH1 mod Europe In Ruins. I'm trying to get started porting it to COH2.  I have no interest in Steam achievements.

I have opened the EXE in Hopper.app and found an Misc_IsDevMode offset that is set to 0.  Changed it to 1 and patched the EXE. But it doesn't seem to do anything. Trying to attach a debugger is caught by the Sega DRM DLL and it's using more sophisticated methods than IsDebuggerPresent.

You can run mods without -dev if you package them.  I've also done this but there is some sort of CRC checks because my changes are read and I can see them in 1v1 skirmish vs AI

1371086775.0,1g8kzc,HDD Firmware: Where to Start,Habstinat,26,5,17,"    
As the owner of a Lemote Yeeloong and an ardent free software supporter, contrary to what most might think, I've discovered that even the Yeeloong isn't completely free, although it's still the closest thing we've got to it as of yet. There are two components which still contain nonfree firmware on the Yeeloong:

0. The embedded controller
0. The HDD (320GB SATA).

At least there's a start for the embedded controller

After asking around a little, and not a single person has made any notable attempt to replace their hard drive's firmware with a custom-hacked-up-version of their own firmware. The effects of designing a free software HDD firmware replacement will not only be ethical, though; others have thought of a few pragmatic consequences:

* Prevent problems like [this firmware bug
* Make data forensics easier by providing more detailed debug commands

I'm sure there are other practical benefits as well; you can think them up yourself. 

So what I'd like to do is reverse engineer current HDD firmwares to develop a free (as in freedom) replacement firmware for HDDs (and maybe also SSDs). The craziest part: Going into this

My question is explained in the title of this post -- Where do I start? Here's a brief description of my technical background so far:

* I own the ""The C Programming Language"" by Kerninghan and Richie (2nd edition) and I've read through and understand the basic core of C
* I know the basics of GNU/Linux (Debian and Arch-based).
* I once tried to learn MIPS assembly via a Wikibook

For those that don't know

Am I correct in assuming that my first step would be building or buying an [RS232-to-TTL adapter](https://sites.google.com/site/seagatefix/) and testing out sending commands to my hard drive? Does anyone here know any information about the role of firmware on an HDD? What exactly does firmware need to do, and decompiling firmware updates from WD's website; what machine language would you suppose they would be written in? Not x86, right? Has anyone had any similar experience and advice to share? 

I'm only a sophomore in highschool

Here are some random statistics on the HDD in the Yeeloong

1342993938.0,wzezk,Help with Getting into the RE Industry,Chuuy,23,3,27,"I'm a 17 year old who is attending Bradley University next semester as a computer science major. I slowly started programming and reverse engineering on my own time about five years ago and I have learned that I have a true passion for these activities. However

The problem is that I have no idea how to get myself into that industry. Unlike programming in which programmers are literally everywhere, but as you can imagine, these applications are rare and have high requirements. I simply do not know how to find an internship or entry-level job that can give me experience with reverse engineering.

Another problem is that I am not sure how to display my reverse engineering abilities. I have had a couple of programming jobs in the past and while I am sure that experience will help me find any type of job, a few viruses, a few applications, and a few crackmes. Apart from reverse engineering viruses, I do not believe any of the things that I have reverse engineered can be looked at as professional because my activities can be viewed as immoral or even illegal. Everything I have reverse engineered was primarily to learn and to practice something I enjoy doing, but also because I wanted to hack/crack an application or because I wanted to satisfy my curiosity. If programmers want to have something truly professional on their resume, they can always contribute to open source or start a project that can help people. I was wondering if there was something similar that a reverse engineer could do.

I was wondering if a professional within the industry could give a young reverse engineer some advice. Thanks for reading

We're a small consulting company based in Baltimore, don't discount it yet.  Send me an e-mail if your only hold-up is Baltimore.

The job is quite diverse.  Over the last year, some binary mobile application audits, a few source audits (C/C++/C#/Python) and 2 web app audits.  The ability to get into and understand an unknown codebase quickly is useful.  We also do some vulnerability discovery stuff, if you're into that.  The company was started by a Johns Hopkins professor and his students, so there is a focus on research and learning -- you will have some time each week to dedicate to research and publishing your work is encouraged.  A large majority of the jobs we get are interesting enough and weird enough to hold my fleeting attention.          

Feel free to send me an e-mail and we can discuss ISE further:
dion@securityevaluators.com
I'll also respond to comments on this thread.     

Much of the work we've done recently has been ""embedded"".  Lots of ARM, and other weirder things in the past.  As an excuse to learn more about the Atari 2600, I created a crack-me to help you figure out if you'd like the kind of work we do.  It also lets you work on something that isn't locked into your preferred platform (unless you're some kind of weirdo).

The challenge can be found here:

Yeah, the first four bytes of which is typically a pointer to the unicode string, or just some garbage bytes. About +0x24 into the structure is a DWORD that has the string length, and zero is a valid value for it (which is why that pointer can have garbage in it I guess). I am pretty certain that this structure is a C++ STL string (it's using the MSVR100 runtime). 

So here's the question:

We are a fully-funded startup building a web-based service for analyzing and searching code. You will be in charge of building a large

This is not yet another project to mine social networks to create ads! Some of the capabilities you will implement are:

* Nearest-neighbor search in high dimension (or knowing how to avoid this by projecting to a lower dimension)
* Classifying code by various metrics
* Map/reduce deconstruction of complex queries
* Distributed computing design, load balancing 

**Requirements**

Exceptional at:

* Python or Ruby
* C/C++
* Unix programming (Linux and/or FreeBSD)
* Working independently to solve problems

Good working understanding of:

* MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Key/value stores
* Cluster management and Unix admin (Fabric and Chef)
* Compilers

Strong interest in:

* Low-level computing (assembly language, intermediate languages)
* Using the right algorithm and implementation for the right problem. Knowing how to do profiling and basic statistics to make that choice.
* Machine learning: clustering
* Distributed systems and fault-tolerant computing (BigTable, and similar designs)
* At least one assembly language (x86 preferred)

We're only interested in people who produce working code and deploy it. This is not a research position involving modeling and R. We're a fast-paced company -- if you run into a problem

The software is here: http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/4/69446ACF-E625-4CCF-8F56-58B589934CD3/Xbox360_64Eng.exe and the exe I'm most interested in is XboxStat.exe - it responds to the guide button being pressed.

The function may also be hidden in one of the xinput*.dll files
