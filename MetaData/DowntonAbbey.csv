Wonderful. It was good fun but I did have to go read about the evolution of formal dress to fully appreciate it:

1356563086.0,15hm82,Question regarding this situation... [SPOILERS GALORE],Mrs_Damon,67,7,84,"By that I mean the Dan Stevens situation.

I've read a few articles but I am confused whether it was Dan Steven's *own* decision to leave Downton or if Matthew's fate was already destined. I'm curious because I want to know if I should be angry at Dan Stevens or Julian Fellows. 

If it was by Dan's own virtue to leave, starring in different movies and all that jazz... However, would it have *killed* him to stay aboard and maybe not appear in a few episodes? I'm not sure about you guys, but Sybil's death is still fresh in my mind [thankful for shirtless Branson :)] and now there's Matthew to deal with? In all honesty, half of the reason why I watched this show was because of the Mary/Matthew relationship [and Sybil but...] and even Matthew as a character because he had his witty moments and bumbling-ness that was entertaining. But to think that he could just wittle away all of his work because he was maybe getting tired of DA or something just makes me sad that he wouldn't think of owing it to the viewers that pined for his character &amp; Mary to get together. If this was the case, then he should've stayed with Lavinia and saved me the party I threw of her death! Granted, he doesn't *owe* it to the viewers however I would think he would have SOME appreciation for the die-hard Team Servants.

/end of rant. It's *not* what Sybil would've wanted. 

**tl;dr** what the frig

[Conspiracy Theory Alert]

Here's what I'm thinking that would tie up some loose ends presented in this episode.  Here are the facts that we know:

-Branson was thinking about leaving for Liverpool.

-The baby's christening is going to be a big deal.

-Cora said she would support Branson and the baby... given Sybil's last wishes, importantly, may not accept... especially when we consider his character.)

-Matthew may be infertile (furthermore the fact that the doctor got Sybil's condition wrong means


So, I feel like he's going to go running back to Ireland (perhaps even with the baby).  I expect that he'll be arrested, found guilty, and executed (maybe this will happen in the same episode that Bates is freed???).  The baby will of course come back to Downton.  NOW, at this point Matthew will find out for certain that he's infertile.  Why shouldn't he and Mary then adopt the child?

I find I'm having Downton Withdrawal Syndrome. During the day I find myself wishing I could hear Mrs. Patmore's folksy, you angel - he's a stern old grouch!). I suppose I sort of miss the elegantly restrained yet crisp barbs that Carson aims at Thomas or Mrs. O'Brien at table in the servants' hall. 

Everybody upstairs except the deliciously devilish DC can go hang as far as I'm concerned but sometimes I suppose I'd like to hear some of Robert's confident command. But really it's Mrs. Patmore and Daisy I mostly want to soak up

It reminds me of reading the early books in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I just wanted to go be in Emond's Field and soak up simple daily life in the village. I wanted to live there for real. I wanted someone to rap me on the knuckles for trying to steal a pie off a window sill, wanted to walk to town leading a donkey pulling a cart of produce, wanted to hear the clang of Master Luhhan's hammer at the forge, wanted to see people bargaining with a trader for thread and needles or examining a horse for sale, etc. I didn't want to go be part of the flashy stuff like magic or palaces or battles or monsters. I wanted the simple stuff of daily life in a humble village.

Likewise I want to be hanging out at the counter down in the kitchen as Mrs. Patmore gesticulates with her long wooden spoon and bustles about overseeing meal prep, as the place buzzes like a hive with a dozen people hurrying about their tasks.

For me

On the one hand they can feel small and unworthy compared to the upstairsers, apologize for sitting in the lord's presence as they almost pass out.

Being American and living in the present day, the exaggerated notion of the reality of blue blood betterness. So, using my own context as my lens, I'm sympathetic to the little people, and the real-life historical counterparts they represent, and sort of root for them to stand up and realize they're as good as anyone. I get wistful about people I never met in an era I never experienced. 

I love love loved it when Ygritte the Wildling (or whatever her Downton maid name was) escaped a life of service and became a secretary. The pluck and courage she showed by getting that typewriter and doing the correspondence course, that transition from ""I can't, I'm no good, I'm not worthy, I could never,"" to ""I can do this, I'm good."" Ohhhh. That's universal as a story theme and is one we can all identify with fundamentally in our own context

I imagine it's a bit of an ego stroke for me, and how their perspectives must have changed as the era of service and aristocracy faded away. Maybe they felt evolved and liberated and better off, like how Americans imagine Russians had to have felt after the fall of the USSR. Or maybe they felt wistful for the old ways, like many older Russians say they actually feel about the Soviet period. Either way - go, little people, go! You're the good ones! 

**tldr** - I love the little people

My girlfriend has been stubborn about catching up and I just need to know what others think about this:

Does anyone else think Mrs. Hughes is still dying and merely concealing it to avoid being coddled? The three things that peak my suspicion are:

* The way she watched Mr. Carson singing when he heard the good news but turned away quickly
* She seems mellowed out; she seems to be at almost a weird place between melancholia and euphoria.
* The way the toaster sort of made her come across as young and progressive like someone really living the end of their days to their fullest.

This is obviously a reference to the character of [Mr. Toad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Toad) in Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel *[The Wind in the Willows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows)*. But is it a reference to the novel (published several years before WWI broke out

In 1929 a theatre in London produced a play by AA Milne (author of *Winnie the Pooh*) entitled *[Toad of Toad Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_of_Toad_Hall)*. Is the elder Lady Grantham referring to a play that was produced eleven years after the armistice?
