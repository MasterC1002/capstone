**Background:** [This is my first aya experience 2 years prior](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91566), I assumed that 12/12/12 would be another significant day to trip. I was correct.

I fasted for 30 hours before drinking the aya, 12/12/12. In our room, there happened to be 12 people present, including the shaman and his wife, 12 for 12/12/12 ;) There were many blankets, a puke bucket for each person, and Jesus held the space well, to bring the spirit of mother Earth into the room. At this point

Jesus starts to sing, his voice suddenly changes as if he's possessed. All of a sudden I have a flashback to burning man, when my voice was possessed by something that sounded very similar. [I wrote a post about this earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/11vcqx/insectoid_aliens_wtf/). Why an indigenous shaman of the rainforest, who had probably left the jungle for the first time less than a decade ago, was making digeridoo noises associated with shamans of Asia and Africa, blows my mind. No explanation. Anyways, this is when I began to trip...

I felt the presence of Mama Aya; I could even see her. She appeared as a woman, and said she knows the human soul better than any other plant/spirit on the Earth. She started to send me vibes of love and reassurance that everything would be okay. And then I felt this vibration throughout my body, most intense in my hands.  I saw these snakes begin to wrap around my body, my arms, and then my legs. I felt like I was being twisted in impossible directions, and it was very uncomfortable. All of a sudden this chill went through my body, and it felt like every cell in my body was being squeezed of all it's juices, once the aya left my intestines

Surrounding me were the DMT elves, and I think I knew what it was they wanted me to do. On 11/11/11, I actually did it, which is to become the God-head, our 'birthright' as it felt. Anyways, I didn't become the God-head this time, but that's okay. The entities began showing me these objects which looked like faberge eggs. I don't know why they were showing me these objects, I hatched out of an egg as I became the god-head, felt very light, with my eyes closed

At this point I felt like royalty, being worshiped by these beings, who were telling me that I was the king of kings, and that my accomplishment on 11/11/11 was the most significant event in human history. They were basically worshiping me, and letting me know that there is a kingdom in heaven, and I am the king. I remained skeptical of this, as I always do when entities worship me or try to seduce me in visions. So I began to do yoga, and I would see visions of amplification. I realized that every physical position I make, like karma into the world. I would put my hands together in namaste,6 copies of it. 

I asked, trying healing work on myself (I've never done this). Eventually I came up to my right side, which had been hurting for some time. What I saw was a crying baby, made of darkness. I ask, ""why is this fetus here, is it supposed to be?"" I am told, ""no, and I sacrifice it, the contents of it's dark body enter my stomach. At this point, long after I'm done tripping

I see this vision where I'm lying on an alter, but I start having trouble breathing, and it feels like how I felt when I awakened my kundalini on 11/11/11. It's hard to describe, but it's a very uncomfortable process where you have this energy that you need to release. It starts at the base of the spine, and then it builds up into throat, and you want to scream! This time, once I release this energy, and I'm just in awe of this beauty. And I see this crystal in the center of the Earth, that look like crystals or balls also. I started to act as 'ambassador of Earth' and started communicating with these entities. There was no direct verbal communication, no communication. It was cool.

So, like brown and goopy. I think it's supposed to look like a crystal, but I see shards of light popping out of the goop, like popcorn, or trees above a canopy. And this goop is sticky, so whoever is popped out, brings up everyone else around them. I think this is a visual representation of our 'awakening', but once a certain number of individuals reach a level of awakening

I have a sense of control of my experience at this point. So, and I was very disappointed because I wanted to learn from them, but I'm not in the right mindstate to remember my dreams that well). Crazy enough, they actually came. There were 9 of them. They began to show me my past life in Asia, they say I was a Buddha in my past life (or something, it's very confusing). I see visions of mountains and trees in Asia. They start teaching me lessons in really interesting ways, like through trickery (pretending to sleep, testing me and whatnot). They say I'm young in this incarnation? Then I'm shown the importance of strict Asian discipline (because it kind of annoys me, there are greater purposes for our individual lives. How over generations our actions have an affect on the collective consciousness, but the dream of humanity over the course of thousands of years.

I realized how powerful our physical bodies are, that is fucking powerful. And then baby spirits began to play in the fauna of my gut, like it's a field and they're on a playground. And then I remember the agreement. In exchange for healing, entities/energies are allowed to exist within my physical body. They're like babies, getting used to the experience of physicality. There is a lot of power associated with our physical selves, and without us, there isn't really much of a purpose to the nonphysical realm

So after the experience was over (I'm not tripping), the Grandma Spirit, Pachamama, was very happy with our ceremony. She sent each of us a hummingbird, which apparently is very significant within the Peruvian culture. Jesus also said that ""I (drpotatoe) was a powerful Asian warrior in my past life."" That blew my mind. Keep in mind Jesus comes from a tribal culture, and warrior can mean a lot of different things. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this. You guys are awesome, probably hard to believe

1327922956.0,p2wbu,A very simple and easy to follow Ayahuasca brewing technique,josificus,64,2,27,"**Things needed:**

*For 1 dose of ayahuasca* 

* 5-10 grams of Mimosa Hostilis root bark 
* 2 - 5 grams of Syrian Rue seed matter 
* 1 empty tea bags
* 1 stainless steel or ceramic pots
* Vinegar 
* empty gel capsules

**How it’s done:**

**Step 1** 
The mimosa hostilis root bark is pulverized and shredded into a stringy/powdery consistency
This is done by either using a coffee grinder
If you are brewing for multiple people it is not necessary to brew the rootbark across individual pots

**Step 2**
The stainless steel pot is then filled with roughly about 400ml of water and 4 tablespoons of vinegar. The root bark should be submerged into the water and brought to a slow simmer

Once most of the water in the pot has evaporated

**Step 3**
Before the water has simmered down to about ¾ of the way down, egg whites should be added to help eradicate the purge, they will soak up the tannins but not the DMT. The egg whites should then be sieved out of the water once they have hardened and solidified , this step will reduce nausea in leaps and bounds and will chance the Ayahuasca from the consistency of a foul sludge to the consistency of milk.  

**Step 4 ** 
Syrian rue seed matter can be prepared in the same way as the root bark if preferred but the easiest way to prepare Syrian rue is to simply stuff it into empty gel capsules.
If the gel cap technique is used

**Step 5**
This takes practice.

**Dosage onset and Duration:**
*Threshold:* 5g 
*Light:* 5 – 7g
*Moderate:* 7 – 10g
*Strong:* 10g +
(Dosage for the mimosa hostilis root bark)

*Onset:* 20 minutes – 4 hours 
*Duration:* 2 – 6 hours 
*Normal After Effects:* up to 8 hours

**Consumption**
The Syrian rue

**Precautions**
Syrian rue is an RIMA meaning dietary restrictions can be largely ignored as syrian rue does not contain an MIAO
Although RIMAs are generally safer than MAOIs

1367948295.0,1dvgvb,Things I've learned from the psychedelic experience:,Huck13b3rryF1nn,64,7,68,"* Regarding the psychedelic experience itself

* This moment of existence is so important if for no other reason that everything is presently stable and one can relax and soak it all in
 
* It's okay to stop listening to music sometimes.  

* It's okay to listen to music when it would seem 'inappropriate' to (like in a beautiful natural wonder

* Input:Output.  If you want to get more from your input

* Marijuana isn't really meant to get 'fucked up' on.  It's just to help you relax / provide fresh perspective.

* Sitting indian-style with your head tilted naturally towards the sun at high noon tends to lead to temporary nirvana

* Nirvana is a fleeting state that must always be fought for to maintain.  it comes and goes and maybe even sticks around if you want it to.

* While our brains are programmed to depression, you can totally deprogram yourself despite what academia and logic may suggest, but it's very difficult to do.  Mind &gt; Matter.

* Every moment, every interaction -- everything is potentially psychedelic if you are open to it and 'stereotypically psychedelic culture', if anything, is limiting many from really breaking through to some radical new opinions (i.e. until you see where waka flocka flame, the beatles and beethoven are all coming from, you still have a lot to learn)

* Nothing is so good that it is above you.  All culture is ultimately guidance.  High-end culture

* To change behavior, the faster the behavior will change -- but even small obstacles will, over time, be too cumbersome to continously overcome.  (example of small obstacle -- feeling guilt)

* Give up Fast Food.  Try to eat fruits and vegetables when-ever possible and you'll naturally start to eat healthier.

* Everything living around you feels as real as you feel -- this includes insects and animals and people alike.

* We all tap into the same place for information and the notion that some people can 'claim' they 'discovered' this information first is absurd.  Innovation comes in waves because it's only ever one source anyone is pulling from.

* In my opinion

* No one

* To have true balance it can be necessary to engage in self-indulgence, just to see if you can still remember how to get back on.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,1367948822.0,cubensis,

==================
TL;DR First time Smoking DMT. Found doorway &amp; had to choose whether to enter. I did. Broke through. It took me to meet another ""being"" (description below). One of them approached me &amp; draped ""rose petals of energy"" across me &amp; clearly said ""It's OK

The search was over, a crystal/wax type substance with a yellow tinge. After excitedly making a ""half decent"" bulb vape my friend arrived. We sit on the floor surrounded by cushions to ensure everything is comfortable, the ambient music of Shpongle plays softly in the background while we carefully weigh two 50-60mg doses and loaded one into the vape. We were all set, the time had come for our maiden voyage - destination unknown!

We spend a few minutes meditating, upon breathing out I begin to hear a high pitched humming, by the time I'm halfway through my second toke reality is fractalizing away into complex patterns &amp; bright colours. I can't see the vape through all these colors but as requested my friend puts the tube in my mouth &amp; encourages a final breath, I take a small 3rd hit and quickly fall into what looked to him like a trance state. Things get very intense from here on but I will do my best to explain what followed.

The start of the trip is hardest to explain. The come on is so quick and intense that I didn't have much time to take in what was happening, I eventually did ""let go"" and almost immediately I was ""dropped"" into another ""level"" &amp; the humming stopped. 

My consciousness was dumped in front of a large glowing arch which opened into another tunnel. There was nothing else at this level no colors, that nobody else could make this choice for me nor would it be forced upon me. It was a very calming, relaxing &amp; a probably rare feeling of control over this crazy new DMT world. The choice I was presented with was simple. I could either pass through the doorway to ""the other side"" or I could stay here &amp; play in the colours before returning home. Almost instinctively I began to turn away from the purple doorway but gladly had a feeling that this isn't right, that I should be going through the door. As soon as this thought crossed my mind I was immediately pulled into the doorway &amp; began another light speed ascent into the unknown.

This is where things get really weird. I am again ""dropped"" into a new world, it was not a huge opened space &amp; the sketched lines seemed to keep things ""enclosed"". I could make out what seemed almost like a table in the ""corner of the room"" - it was almost like I had entered someone house, I could feel a strong presence that someone was home. Once I began to look around I could vaguely see other ""beings"" across the room, they didn't pay much attention to me at first but soon a “female being"" came forward and approached me, she was indescribably beautiful. She had a very oblong head shape but no face or internal components – just the beautiful &amp; well defined outline of her body with 2 legs &amp; 2 arms. She was almost 2D, I couldn't see much depth to her &amp; everything was frontal view even though she moved through the room &amp; turned multiple times she seemed to have no back or sides that I could make out. Her body was like a ""rainbow aura"", like someone had traced the outline of her body with a bright greeny blue colour and then traced inside the trace lines with other bright colours. I clearly remember that she had 2 bright red things on her head that looked like ""rose petals of energy"" (for a poor description). I keep referring to ""her"" because her body was like a females except I can't recall there being any outlines around the breast area just a curvy waist &amp; very feminine feeling presence

She smiled at me for a minute and approached closer &amp; closer until she was standing, Welcome!"". After she had finished her little ""welcoming ceremony"", she smiled warmly at me &amp; slowly began to leave the room. I didn't want her to leave &amp; asked her to come back. She did turn around and acknowledged my request but only very briefly as she gave me one last mischievous smile &amp; departed for the final time.

The trip was mostly over now. I kept my eyes closed for what must have been another 10 minutes. At first

The weirdest part of this experience is that you are completely sane through the entire trip

I'll also try to attach some of my primitive illustrations for both the trip visuals and the metaphysical ideas, so this won't be just a boring pile of text.

Experience Entry #1 2.3.2012

Dose/Preparation: 12 g Mimosa Hostilis root bark (powdered) was lightly boiled during 3 hours in acidic water

Set &amp; Setting: The S&amp;S was probably the most perfect I could ever achieve. During the day I didn't eat anything and I cleaned my whole apartment, I turned off all lights and lit up an incense stick and some candles around my bed. I was ready to leave this world.

Ingestion: The Syrian Rue liquid was taken first, probably due to knowing what to expect.

The Beginning of the Journey: (Insanity

For about an hour I just lay in my bed, so the memories were all hazy. I've smoked DMT a few times recently though, but in my experience it's kinda different, and a bit too short to get any real insight from. So at the end of the hour there was this sort of calming and mystical feeling of all my motor and visual functions, I assumed this to be the Syrian Rue at play. After the hour things started to get a bit weird and my thoughts with them. There was some kind of an anxious phase at this point, and I started to think whether this was a good idea after all, maybe it's gonna be too intense, maybe this

After a while I just came to the conclusion what the hell, it feels like you're going insane. First your train of thought starts to break down, then the sentences start to get messed up, then the words themselves start to become gibberish. Finally your thoughts seem something like this: ""Fzgprrq nbqz... B&amp;fstw fds£hgg?? Z#pr@&amp;w!!!!"", while at the same time there's some really WEIRD imagery flashing before your eyes with a fast pace. In a way it's like you're unlearning everything you've ever learned, so you're like a baby who hasn't learned any languages or anything yet.

The next part, very sinister. The loud noises are hard to describe, they're not actual sounds and they're different each time, but it's like really loud bangs, and each of them disintegrate a part of your ego and body and apartment. You can actually FEEL the concept of ""death"" in each bang. Even if you can't think in languages anymore, you have a primitive form of thoughts that feels a bit like this: "" BANG Aaaaah shit!! Oh shit.. I can't take it anymore.. I don't wanna die.... When is the next bang gonna come.. When is it gonnaaa comeeee.... ... ... Oh, I guess it's not-- BANG AAAAHHHhhhh!!!"".

The frequency of the bangs also increases with time, then you can join us. Just hang in there you big baby!"". I think the reason why it seems like a confusing feeling is that we're not used to thinking about death as something positive. But after it's over it becomes so clear to you that death is one of the most positive forces in the universe.

At this point things become really hard to explain or remember,,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,True

Please discuss. ,March_of_the_ENTropy,46,5,28,"I'm largely non-theistic in nature but last weekend I had my word rocked. I bought some capped syrian rue from a vendor there and usued my personal stash of dmt for blast off. I didn't feel anything after the first 3 hits
My friend was concerned that I was going to hurt myself so he made me wait while he grabbed his coat to come with me. I approached where i could see the burning boars head from the front of the caravan in the woods and walked in on a strange ritual that disappeared when my tripsitter approached and morphed back into trees and a low burning campfire. I had lost them. 

After some time of looking around (had climbed the whole mountain the day before so I knew how huge the area was) i couldnt find them and decided to go give purging a shot as the nausea grew. I walked up a different part of the hill past a large ornate black gate...that turned into thorns when i touched it and walked up a hill to a beautiful marble bench that was actually a fallen log. About this time I began losing my mind. Every 5-10 minute or so i would lapse into a state of total unreality where i could see things pouring out of the forest after me. some on war-horses, i had one of the sprites as in the caravan approach me and try to talk to me. She didn't say words but i could tell she was trying to talk to me and couldn't. Eventually she realized i was to dumb to hold conversation on her level and left. I felt absolutely crushed. the worst and most painful form of rejection one can feel. I started crying and the forest was back with a vengeance. I finally ended up dry-heaving my final dry-heave and had no more energy to keep throwing up. I rinsed my mouth out in a stream (didnt swallow because i'd just puke it back up) and walked back to the main stage and every shadow was a teenaged-mid20something humaniod entity chilling in the bushes. I was initially EXTREMELY embarrassed for having lost my shit and chanting and all that infront of them, so i quickened my pace and ran into the gate that was previously thorns. I swung it open (it is NOW a gate...it wasn't the next day when I revisited) and brushed bast it only to be stopped by a limb trying to trip me and a big long pointy thorn at my neck. I had clearly overstayed my welcome. 

I saw more things including other caravans, some had presence and they interacted with me.

Shapes form, shaving lines; stars and stripes of lesser known variants.  Quadrants collide and equally divide with a total loss of identity, yet remaining the same, fresh smorgasbords of prisms of spatial deformity. Miscellaneous homogeneous landscapes spanning eras of time, one forgetting the other. Lights shines around the corners, leaking in from the hazed backing of sight, a murky reminder of an alternative world waiting on the other side. 

Tangible swirls of uniform color fades as shapes cascade against each other, motion weld in occurrence. Limbs sprawl and grab at the edges of the universe, tugging at the fabric of reality, nevertheless trapped by the boundaries of limit.

People bash to and fro as they swarm from assorted clusters of buildings and domiciles

Individuality streams from seams of littered fabric as they are live and return to the tapestry of life. Live and breathe, your parents, government officials, what makes their existence any different than yours. You are all part of the same inevitable reality of perception, spinning on a rock within a prism of the universe.

This leaves you to wonder

Leave the phantom hourglass that is life and see for yourself what lies in the parallel darkness.

Color interacts with surrounding light, cordial reflected light bouncing off other objects; what you see may not be what you perceive. The nature of existence is reliant on the ability to perceive physical objects. All things and experiences are impermanent within your own conditioned phenomena.   

Everything is in a constant flux, which leaves you to the connection of your mind. Your mind is filled with bad abstraction. Tangents that go off into nowhere, bad habits of repeating yourself and deja vu. The locus of your being is the communicative event of the language that you use. What you feel, what you think and do comprise your own reality, yet the reality in your mind is formed by the mere awareness of conscious thought. Language shapes the thought process into questioning the inexhaustible meaning of being; you project self as your body, your hands, your legs, anger, so whats to say matter is just another facade of reality? You can reproduce matter on the television

You're a product of genes and adopted stance. You are a idea-replicator producing itself in a new host. You are the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs. A tangible mass of protein strings. An out of body experience. A phantom in the shade.

The ability to find contentment in experience and not material goods has directly influenced the direction of my life since beginning to use psychedelics. The possibility that religious doctrines all in some way focus on reforming the value system in order to gain enlightenment is also a concept that I have come to understand. In my experience religions often have this concept at their original beginning  but that later in the religions life this is usually buried under doctrine that is put in place to control the followers of that religion. For instance this can be seen in the Catholic church and how they restricted the coping of the Bible in any language other than latin to prevent the lower classes from being able to read the Bible themselves and thus allowing the church to create and impress its own value system on society at large.
The most useful property of entheogens (particularly psychedelics) is that they inhibit the ""cultural"" filter that is a natural development of the human psyche for survival in a larger society

First off

I dropped my first 2 hits of the LSD at 3:07pm. Didn't feel effects after 30 min. so I immediately ate 2 more and then waited until i finally felt something at 4:30. I decided that I wanted a more intense experience than I assumed I would have after feeling the come up of the current dose

After I took my last doses, but everything was trailing and seemed like there was a massive fog obscuring my vision at times. 

As time went on, and I'm lucky enough to have a really wonderful backyard filled with redwood trees, ferns and all sorts of lush greenery. The colors of things were so amazingly pronounced, and I, of course, felt a massive connection with them. They danced and moved as I stood in awe of the moving canvass in front of my eyes. The hallucinations had started and they were very lucid. 

That continued until around 10pm where the effects of the LSD were waning. I was still listening to music and smoking with my friends at the house, you know the onset is immediate. When I snorted this 2C-E under the influence of the acid tabs, it was so much more defined and prounounced. It turned my slow warbling fracal vision into a precise sharply tuned array of different moving fractals. 

Another hour passes and the MDA is kicking in and I feel my head come out of the extreme mind fuck of the acid and become more grounded, I took a look at my cement floor. Amazingly intricate geometric patterns moving like cogs in a finely tuned watch. Everything morphed into another working cog in this mechanical geometric persian rug pattern, and it went on for hours, it was breath taking. Some designs would linger longer than others and become somewhat burned in my field of vision, only to fade away in a slow morph of neon colors. 

at around 1am my 2 friends bid me a farewell, the visuals had ramped up, and the music was sounding better than ever.

I kept listening to music and trying to keep my eyes open for the vivid OEV's i was receiving. At around 530am I realized it was time for sleep

The circumstances with some personal issues between friends was the only thing that made the experience slightly less than stellar

It started when I began to really appreciate psychedelics. Once I realised it wasn't all about rainbow slinkys and glow sticks (although these activities are essential sometimes) I started to prefer using nature for my trips. I was comfortable tripping by myself and would happily just chill in the back garden or anywhere where I know I'm unlikely to be disturbed. 

This one occasion I went on a break with my cousin (who is twice my age and has done his share of trips) who has a little caravan by the beach. It was getting dark but I was still keen to stay up where as my cousin was ready for sleep. I dropped some mushrooms (not loads) and went down to the beach. I just lay there and listened to the sea going backwards and forwards while staring at a full canopy of stars. There was some large palm-like trees just behind me and I could see their leaves above me if I looked back. 

It was one of the nicest little trips I had and as I listened to the rolling sea and rattling leaves above my head while watching the stars I was in massive awe of all the beauty surrounding me. I watched the sky and from nowhere this orange orb slowly went across the sky. If I had held a cent out at arms reach

About 2 weeks later I was back at my house with my friend and we decided to drop some acid. We lay on sun loungers as the sun went down and I reluctantly told him about seeing a UFO recently. It was met with a bit of an awkward silence and lack of interest so I left it at that and we continued chatting until we were tripping heavily. I lay there again, it's f*cking UFOs"" (seriously) as we jumped around in disbelief. My friend is a massive sceptic with things like that (I didn't blame him) but that made it all more believable for me. Even after, under his breath, he still admits he saw something he has never seen before.


Nearly finished....

About a year or something after this I had another session at my house (with different friends). By then I was well in to the idea that aliens may exist and visit earth bla bla. We had some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds but stayed inside since it was winter. It got to about 10am and everyone had crashed apart from me and one friend who was still 10 miles high and making some typical profound observations on dog the bounty hunter. I had stopped tripping and was only staying up to keep him company and keep any demons at bay. He eventually came down a bit and was comfortable going home

I woke up later that afternoon to missed calls and a txt from him saying he had just seen UFOs while sitting outside his house! I spoke to him later and he was convinced that while was talking a breather before going in to his house

This is obviously terribly flawed since we are talking about seeing a phenomenon whilst hallucinating. However from being around sceptical people and witnessing them I feel strongly inclined to believe that what I have seen

It has told me in my human form I am going to die soon and that it has to happen because it has to happen.

My first 'learning' trip was a while back, the words ""just drugs"" are thrown around and the experience is brushed away and forgotten. 

The next time I tripped

Every trip has been like this. A continuation... telling me all the knowledge as if to prepare me for something.

The last time I did LSD was a month or so ago.  I felt like I was dying, trying to burst through that other side of light, but something went wrong and the process didn't complete. I felt like half my body was droopy...I felt half decomposed or something... I felt stuck in two different dimensions. I was told that this might not work and we'll just have to try again next time. ... I was so confused. Try what?

My boyfriend and I planned to do LSD together two days from now; and meditate, etc, but today I just suddenly decided I wanted to smoke Salvia.

I smoked salvia, it was simply a 'lets get down to business' feeling. I was asked where my boyfriend was.  I felt like me but NOT me, like an awake me, like an ""oh shit..right- this."" sort of feeling.

(9:00 PM) As I was winding down I just lounged naked (lace patterns on my skin!) in my computer chair

After a few tries, through the walls I could see hulking tentacle creatures reaching up to the sky, all made of advanced machinery and coexisting with life outside. It was all very ""War of the Worlds"" or something. 

(10:40 PM) I hoped the vision wouldn't fade but eventually it did and I was left with a few basic patterns before I eventually fell asleep at the end of the trip. I woke up the next morning feeling well-rested with no negative effects.

My friend guided me through some meditation. He knew not where he lead but started talking. I wasn't really listening to his words but rather formed this picture in head. I could see the big bang and could see all the events in time that lead to this moment. I could see the earth being formed and life starting on it. I could see the millions of years of evolution that formed life. I could see animals and early humans growing in harmony and with that I could see magic mushrooms also growing in harmony even potentially helping these apes grow into conscience beings. I could see all the events that had to take place to get my body and spirit to this point in time and space. Then all the sudden I could see all the connections at once. I could see that my body was only a piece of this universe and a way for it to know itself. I felt a pulling as the veil was lifted and I was it. I was the universe experience itself. I was the universal consensus without time or form but was just everything all at once. It saw god and it was myself. It was pure love and beauty and also very bright.


The knowing only happened for a moment in normal reality but I yelled with joy and laughed out loud. I knew and it was funny. Cosmetically funny because I realized I was always this and some part of me knew but the part that is me had forgotten. The feeling of joy was overwhelming and I smiled and knew.


After shouting at joy about knowing enlightenment I could already see the ego coming back and that experience happening in the past. I was a little sad but realized I could go back and it was my turn to be the teacher. I started a guided meditation describing what I had seen the last time. This resulted in the divine knowing again which was just as amazing.

I don’t know where to begin

Here are some of the main highlights:

&gt;“Life is a self-organizing, interconnected, open thermodynamic network of component parts existing in a complex regime in the phase transition between order and chaos as a plant, animal, microbe or fungus.”

&gt;I have argued that network phenomena are at the heart of several if not all major transitions of life. While the specifics differ, natural selection will spread it through the population.

&gt;If each transition mounts a barrier to reversing itself, most physicists hold that there is no arrow of time and at the fundamental level, time is reversible. However, non-biological chemical reaction networks can be sensitive to the direction of time too (Ricard, 2010). Is it then possible that the macroscopic arrow of time that pervades human experience is related to irreversibility associated with network behavior?

&gt;What is the expected impact of a new transition, various new networks have emerged and transitions occurred. A recent and perhaps most revolutionizing network in terms of human experience is the internet. As the complexity of the internet increases, is it possible to live through a phase transition such that the internet acquires some form of intelligence or consciousness, a possibility already raised by Barabási (2002)? ~~Also, consciousness is certainly an emergent phenomenon arising from the neural network connectivity of the brain.~~ Could the human species undergo yet another phase transition?

&gt;Evolutionary changes sometimes occur via symbiosis, a new organism with unexpected potentials emerges. A salient example is the symbiotic development of the eukaryotic cell by the fusion of different bacteria. Since eventually the eukaryotic cells were able to spread through the world, we might wonder whether fusion of computers with humans or symbiosis of robotics, genetics and artificial intelligence can lead to the emergence of a new self-replicating species capable of evolution and spreading through the Earth and perhaps even replacing humanity.

This work is crucial because it supports many of the ideas presented by **Terence McKenna**. I have spent the last 4 years listening to the [psychedelic salon](http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/). If you have not done so already

Another must read for all psychonauts is [this essay](http://www.realitysandwich.com/physicalism_false_view_world) by **Peter Meyer**

Here are some of the highlights:

&gt;If, even to molecules and atoms) then the existence of conscious beings such as ourselves is not a total mystery. But if a physicalist allows the possibility that physical reality is inherently conscious (which idea most physicalists would reject) then the way is open to the idea that there is some reality beyond physical reality (that is, beyond the existence of atoms, subatomic particles and electromagnetic radiation), and to move in this direction is to abandon physicalism.

&gt;Science is not incompatible with the spiritual view if by science is understood a quest for knowledge of what is real. If there is a non-physical reality then a true scientist will wish to know about it. Modern natural scientists often assume that physicalism is true

&gt;There are three positions which a philosopher can take with regard to hyperspace and the DMT entities: 
1.	Hyperspace is no more real than the space experienced in dreams
2.	Hyperspace is real and is not part of physical space; thus its inhabitants are non-physical. 
3.	Hyperspace is real and is fundamentally of the same stuff as the physical world; both are physical but are experienced in very different ways. 

&gt;Actually it is impossible for anyone who has not experienced Level III of the DMT experience to imagine it, except to discuss its philosophical implications based on the reports of those others who actually know what they are talking about.

&gt;Galileo pioneered the foundation of physics upon observation, Cesare Cremonini and Giulio Libri, refused even to look through Galileo's telescope. Similarly, most if not all contemporary philosophers refuse to look through the lens provided by psychedelic substances so as to perceive a reality which physicalists deny exists (just as the philosophers of Galileo's time denied the existence of the moons of Jupiter). Observations resulting from the use of DMT absolutely refute the conventional physicalist view of the world, but at present this is known only by a relatively small number people - who are the true gnostics of this age.

Jung is also somebody who I would look into. Specifically his Red Book

Somewhat related to Jung is a medium named [Bashar](http://bashar.org/). There is seriously some profound shit within his talks. Thank you to whoever posted this here. Whether or not he is actually a medium  is irrelevant

I'm looking for people who are enthusiastic and willing to participate in this type of philosophic discussion. It is our duty to analyze and expound upon these works. Please save these links
Does anybody have any suggestions?

1341027267.0,vttoc,Trip Report: 26mg Psilocetin,vivasativa,30,4,7,"I am amazed at how much planning I had put into this experience and then how much of that planning went right out the window. 

I assumed my experience today would go much like my last experience on 25mg and so I spent time during the week creating a playlist of music that went on for several hours. This did come in handy for the come up. I also spent the day completing a large list of errands which upon completion I would treat myself to a much anticipated journey into...? I would also like to mention I intentionally did not eat after midnight and up to the time of ingesting which was around 4pm today. 

The come up was familiar. It's onset was quick. I had some idea of what was coming so instead of lying in my bed and waiting like before I casually went about my leisure activities. When I was clearly hallucinating I put on my playlist which started with The Allman Brothers *Jessica*. I found it to be not quite relaxing

For whatever reason the first hour or so was ridiculously intense and not like I remembered it to be. Constant OEVs and CEVs. There were eyeballs. There were mouths with big white teeth, and safe. I wish I could describe what I saw when I closed my eyes because it was fantastic. It's almost too soon to be thinking about it, but I feel very compelled to write this report while it's still fresh. The last bits of my come up are hazy. I do remember going in and out of my room, on and off my bed, and all around inside and outside the home in pure tryptamine goodness. 

Here is where memories start to form and can recall actual events. I have a 20 minute track of The Dead's *Dark Star* which absolutely hit the spot. The entirety of that track was amazing and I was somewhat saddened by it ending and transitioning into Tool's *Forty Six &amp; 2*. Though it was this track that led me into one of the most in control psychedelic states I have experienced in some time. This is my third experience with 4-aco and it was about this time that I felt as if I had almost conquered it. I was in a blissful state of control and yet going with the flow. This is when I ""discovered"" my sunny backyard

Outside was a wonderland of beauty. 4-aco and summer afternoons are like bread and butter. I found myself lying on the ground next to my pool beholding the blue sky and whips of clouds. It was magical. The majority of my psych experiences have been at night. This daytime trip was magnificent. I was silent for hours just watching the sky. This is where I felt the most irony as I had put together a playlist of all this music and I ended up experiencing so much more outside in silence

Bit by bit I started to experiment with the pool. A few fingers here

The brain agitates the experience of perception by its energy.

And it also preserves its energy according to the laws of thermodynamics (*).

Meaning its energy is not disappeared by agitating perception.

Meaning its energy is either reflected

It cannot be merely reflected

Does perception perform reactions to the stimuli?

The phenomenon of order emerges from somewhere, else there could be no organisation of body, no cohesion of action and reaction in energy.

And it is perceived.

Order must be able to change

The changing of energy, else that order could not be agitated to change.

This changing of energy must therefore be connected to both the experience of perception and the phenomenon of order.

Meaning the experience of perception is affected by the phenomenon of order.

Meaning order in energy exists in tandem with its disorder and change.

TL;DR Started at the circus

It all begins on the couch at a mates place, the bubbles begin to form and the smoke slowly rises to eventually fill the bulb. I had already decided that I would encourage myself to remain in this world with my eyes open for as long as possible both to inhale as much as I physically could and also to see what this world looks like fractalized, although I quickly realized that keeping one’s eyes open after the second-third large exhalation is much easier said than done. By the time the third breath left my lungs &amp; although my eyes were wide open the entire room, the bulb &amp; my friends were merging &amp; reforming, shaking &amp; breaking in a mix of colorful patterns and fractals. One final large breath &amp; from here on there was no fighting it. It had begun, the moment my eyes &amp; mind slipped out of consciousness I had arrived and it was beautiful, the most beautiful circus you had ever seen... DiMiTry's Circus.

I was not here long but I remember it clearly. It was like the side alley of the circus filled with many interesting rides &amp; shows that I had no comprehension of, some sort of keeper, a protector or guard of sorts and as the legs collapsed in towards me I was scooped up in one giant hugging motion and sucked up ""inside itself"". I found myself in a house that was very ""normal"", considering. There were rooms &amp; each room had a purpose. I was first brought into what felt like a bathroom of sorts. It had a half height wall in the middle of the room and I could clearly see a few entities in this room, they all seemed to have giddy childlike demeanors &amp; were much smaller than the last entity I encountered in my first breakthrough (http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/udejg/its_ok_welcome_my_first_dmt_experience/).  

The eldest (but still very young) painted my face with a purple wand of sorts, it was like he was scared but had built up the courage to play with me intensely for just a brief moment - poking, tickling &amp; laughing with a childlike giddiness before quickly running back to hide again. Like many small children do with new dogs. As I slowly began to drift out of this room I spotted another entity who was just standing there, he was a black entity with brightly colored facial features, much older than the others but did not seem too adult - it was like he was the older brother looking out for his young siblings while they play with their new pet, me. He seemed happy but did not interact at all.

I was taken through the house

Perhaps these entities were similar to the elves that so many describe. They were small, no waist &amp; a more rounded head.

1326577779.0,oh7jq,A truly enlightening trip; I'd like to share parts of it with you beautiful people,thechiefmaster,29,1,23,"This is what I wrote down in the throes of it last night (posted to r/psychonaut): 

i have arrived. the clarity! the beauty! i understand. i am enlightened. i have experienced what ive been in search of. i will never not know anymore. and that's terrifying and amazing at the same time. wow. just wow. im glad and thankful and intimidated at my responsibility at what's ahead. and overwhelmed at what to do with it haha. but i know it will be okay. great even. amazed. im just amazed right now. i know how to handle so many things in my life now. 




This is from my log today:

I felt like I finally made it. I had moments where I was like holy shit. I am “all knowing” -- not that I know everything or even close to it but that I understand everything to a higher degree, like where their behavior comes from. I feel like I don’t need to actually study psychology anymore haha. I'm being serious though, I no longer need to push for arbitrary causes of behavior because it's like I can just feel where things stem from in terms of the things people say, they way the behave. This higher consciousness felt like like I was coasting on a wave; it felt clear and calm but rushing still at the same time, like a river of energy circulating in a higher awareness around the world. I just all of the sudden knew how I should proceed in interacting with everyone that is significant in my life. I could feel who was also up there, or who has the potential to understand, be “touched” with enlightenment. 

I could see why people are the way they are. Even people who bother me and I don’t feel like are good people

I still don’t know what I want to do with my life but I have more potential and can touch more of the world than just being a professional student because that's something I'm good at. I don’t have to get a corporate job or anything, which is what I have always been passionate about, and make a difference.  I remember thinking about okay, what’s mine? What’s my passion and what do I want to do with the opportunities I have? I will not be happy or satisfied in life just coasting. I want to make a difference not for the sake of making a difference, or to feel proud of myself, or anything. I want people to be better off, plain and simple. I have never felt more large scale empathy and love.

On that note: I wanted to tell [significant people in my life, true. It was hard to deal with the emotions. And that’s why I wanted to tell someone, because it was almost too much, too intense for me to be bearing alone, I wanted to give some of the emotion to someone else to carry, but I knew that if I just did it, handle it

I was going through life so blind. That's an extreme statement, how to be good people"" I had really funny visions of myself on a best selling book like a  self improvement one hahah and was really turned off by the idea of profiting off of it. I also pictured myself like as a minister of a “church” which mostly tickled me because of the idea of preaching something that you can only find for yourself.

""All of this is very easy to understand. Fear is the first natural enemy a man must overcome on his path to knowledge. Besides

""A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war, with respect, and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it will live to regret the steps.""

""He (Don Juan) said fears are natural; that all of us experience them and there is nothing we can do about it. But on the other hand, or without knowledge.""

Don Juan explained that there are four natural enemies of a man: fear, and old age. A man must defeat all four in order to be a man of knowledge. The following is a short excerpt on the topic of fear as the first natural enemy.

""What will happen to the man if he runs away in fear?""
""Nothing will happen to him except that he will never learn. He will never become a man of knowledge. He will perhaps be a bully, he will be a defeated man. His first enemy will have put and end to his cravings.""
""And what can he do to overcome fear?""
""The answer is very simple. He must not run away. He must defy his fear, and the next. He must be fully afraid, and yet he must not stop. That is the rule! and a moment will come when his first enemy retreats. The man begins to feel sure of himself. His intent becomes stronger. Learning is no longer a terrifying take. When this joyful moment comes, the man can say without hesitation that he has defeated his first natural enemy.""

1371165031.0,1gavoz,DMT: Connectedness of all Things,oaueo,26,1,14,"The first time I did DMT, and my friend bought a gram and met up later that night just around sunset. We decided to smoke it at my friend’s house where there was a lot of forested area. It was also at the end of a dead-end road

We sat outside first behind the car

My second dose I smoked after sunset with my friend. We shared a set of earbuds to listen to music and dosed together. I was careful not to burn the DMT. After the second hit, the grass turned into a maze with small balls moving in unison to the music as well. The experience was over in a few minutes, but left me breathless. I was incredibly humbled by the experience, as if I had seen “beyond the veil”.

My third dose was the greatest of them all (for that night). My friend, and his friend lined up facing the trees and smoked the remaining DMT. We passed the bowl around a handful of times until we could no longer take it. There was no music for this trip. We simultaneously tripped and seemed to have extremely similar visuals. At one point we fell back on the grass and looked up at the night sky. My friend stated that the stars “looked like they were hanging down on strings”. Suddenly the stars were so close we could touch them, almost manipulate them. I felt the grass and dirt beneath me and looked over my friends. It was such an incredible feeling. I felt like I could feel the entire cosmos, the human experience, and all that was the Earth all that once. It was very powerful and has stuck with me throughout the years.

These three experiences all happened in one night with about 30 minutes to an hour in between for contemplation, and foolishly dosed in a bad location. This lead to a terrible trip, that lead to an unexpected ego-death dose. It was horrible and I have not used DMT since.

That being said, but DMT really humbled me and put psychedelics in perspective. There is only so much you can prepare for a trip and no one is really fully prepared for the different experiences they will have tripping, even on the same substance.

* All matter is merely energy. (E=MC2)
* We live in a Mind over Matter universe: Our will and even simply our conscious observation is what creates the universe
* Mind stems from Consciousness
* We are all One Consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
* The universe is mathematics and can be explained through geometry
* 'God' exists as that One Consciousness (also mathematically as Phi)
* 'God' is everything: including nature, the New World Order, and You and me.
* There is no Good and Evil
* Lucifer
* The universe is split into a male/female
* All Emotions stem from two: Love (female) and Fear (male)
* Conflict only arises from a lack of understanding
* Humans are the 'son of god' and have incredible
* The purpose of life is to EXIST! TO LIVE HAPPY AND FREE. To enjoy life

For those wondering

Experience Time Line:
The main effects lasted a total of 9 hours
Mental state was clear until 1.5 hours into the experience when the visuals developed further only to spring to life the un-natural world inside my home.
It might be described as riding a single very large wave and turning out the backside moments before it crashes on the shoreline -if you are familiar with surfing. If you are familiar with psychedelic mushrooms then you know that the mushroom experience comes in waves -building and receding in strength

Details:
Music kick-started the experience
The music is called ""Are you shpongled"" by Shpongle. It is a perfect complement to the mushroom state.
Come-up was extremely quick
The visuals could be described as fun and mushroom-like until the peak of the experience when they began to take a new form. The visuals now held meaning and represented some memory long forgotten of a world forged in respect for earth and her plants. 
An out-of-body experience occurred during the peak of effects, but no way to really tell) 5 minutes, during which time my body started to shut down. It did not believe it had reason to remain functioning as it did not detect a spirit within. in effect, I witnessed myself --dying right before my eyes. An experience I don't particularly want to repeat, but will not be forgotten. During the time I spent outside of my body I (tried to) speak to entities that revealed themselves to me. The entities I spoke with did not speak english or any language that I recognized as modern. I remember saying ""I don't know what you are, but can we be friends?"". It was so amazingly strange for myself, I usually can keep grounded even in the most intense of situations.

Summary:
It was absolutely amazing, but my body was clearly shaking (almost seizing level)   from the new found energy that is common for me during high doses of any psychedelic substance. Heart rate was elevated more than I would have liked, but that is effectively normal in any dose. 

After Thoughts
A recurring visual hallucination and something I remembering seeing when out of body... Also rabbits are very sensitive to psychedelics when compared to rats and humans. I was noting that I am much more sensitive to mind altering effects than most people.
It was, which means that all my previous reports described oevs  (possibly otherwise, but not likely) It is a very stimulating experience until the peak is over when the body begins to relax as soon as the mind allows.

Here is what I did when I finally grew the nuts to believe in my pursuits and my intuition and take a dive by myself. I had a long-running affection for 2c-e and a growing taste for ketamine as a boost out of the body
I took 30mg of 2c-e at my favourite outdoor sanctuary. perfect setting: I know the area, smoking a little bit of cannabis to ground myself, trying not to think about much except for how beautiful my surroundings are, how sweet the fruit i had to eat was, and how good it is to be alive and at peace. 

Once i felt my first real surge of 2c-e flavor (reaching a ++) I got comfortable, but instead of seeing the physical form I usually can, I was merely aware of this blue energy flowing throughout the tree and the water and all the plants around me. I got uncomfortable and felt like settling, and upon sitting up i felt that i wasn't that dissociated and did another bump, about half as big as the last. I lay down, covered my eyes, and this is where shit got REAL

I went into a vision i can't remember. all I can remember is the conclusion and that it made UTTER sense. the conclusion was the possibility of using mushrooms as part of a cure for my dad's depression/my family's long-running emotional dysfunctions

I settled down from this (the vision itself was very brief) and lay down for another dive. This time the visions were far deeper

I saw masses of suffering, forever repressed and abused by the power of fear, deceit, evil, Satan, the accuser.. Also the unity of all of these negative ideas became very evident to me, a thought I've been entertaining for some time. In so many ways, and how they can unknowingly become beacons of this hell
And then I got sick. 

I had to get it out. it felt okay, crawling, and my soul couldn't take it any more

the grinding hell and chaos was too much, and sat up. 

Here i envisioned this phenomenon that felt very real philosophically. I call it the gaping maw of the void, and very mathematically chaotic--a state of pure disorder, lack of consciousness, intelligence, divinity, whatever you want to call it ;)
This felt all very very revealing and resounding. I began to eat more fruit, how there is no harm in the transaction and both parties involved benefit from either nutrition or spreading of seed, to the violence of warfare, of slavery

It all became, just as the heavens where none suffer and all relationships are mutually beneficial exist, and that this is a natural and infinite cycle whose eternal significance (karma) is a force to be reckoned with. 

Here ends the shamanistic part of the trip. The rest of my day was spent whimsically boarding about and thinking about the implications of my vision earlier regarding my family

I felt like I'd been turned inside out and rubbed against mother earth until nothing was left but my brilliant golden soul. I had reason to laugh without reason for days

1326386941.0,oe2l5,A few questions that have been on my mind lately...,misterrager,27,4,9,"Budding psychonaut with a couple mind blowing acid trips under his belt with a few questions.

1. This feeling of Oneness...surely that isn't the ""end-game scenario"" if you get what I mean. That can't be all it is, nothing is expected of you, etc. Is there any more to this existence, to this reality? I always entertained the notion when I was younger that reality, rather than being neutral or good, may be evil. That this reality may be a cruel experiment or something of the sort. Do you believe that this reality is, at the highest level, mine may be a little vague.

2. I still can't get over the absurdity of existence. I wake up every morning and I think ""oh shit

3. I've come to the conclusion of this: lets assume the worst case scenario possible and say that this reality is indeed a cruel experiment. There's no use crying over the fact that we're in a cruel experiment, you make me live this shitty life for all of eternity, well just out of spite I'm gonna have fun and just fucking embrace the chaos"". How's that line of thinking?

4. Sometimes I go through periods of pretty harsh anxiety and I try to soothe myself by saying ""it's okay, I ask you, why do many psychonauts see the ""big picture"" as Oneness and positive when it could simply be layers of delusion and deceit?

5. ""The only thing that we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us"" What are you doing with the time given to you?

6. The thing that would help me the most from this post is a way to deal with the ""oh shit"" factor of existence/consciousness itself and the feelings of anxiety and absurdity that it brings with it.

7. Many psychonauts tend to be good people or tend to want to be good people. They care about spreading good vibes, and this entire existence thing is just an elaborate way to entertain myself, then surely I can do whatever the fuck I want and although spreading love may seem ""noble"", could that not be construed as just another layer of ego?

I found this a very interesting statement

I would like to invite everyone to put up examples of cognitive dissonance between science models and mystic models

Now, and for me, an anomaly is the most interesting thing there is. It's the place where the model does not fit what is observed and measured, where the explanations break down, and the reason it is exciting is that it's the place where new discoveries, revolutions of understanding, become possible.

Here's an example of an anomaly I love (altho I solved this one long ago):

People will say, no experiencer, there is no separation between subject and object, there is only the underlying unity."". I'm sure many of us have either heard this kind of thing, or had some variation of the experience.

The anomaly should be obvious - if there is no subject or object, to talk about it afterwards? Do those who do talk about it afterwards, if it was truly unified, not care that they are lying about it by describing it in non-unified words? Why does the experience end if it is unified? And so on and so forth - the more you look at the experience, the more anomalies appear - but the core anomaly, the first order anomaly, remains - if there is no experiencer

3:55am (3:55 after initial dose)

dose: 25-30mg 4-HO-MET

So for a few weeks I'd been planning out a good trip. I attempted to weigh out about 21mg of 4-HO-MET, being the idiot I am, said “Eh, this looks like about 20mg” and swallowed it down. 

I walked to the library where my sitter was, and like a lot of trip reports I read, I felt like I was in a big rainbow world. I had strange body load, not completely uncomfortable but a bit agitating at times (though it started out euphoric). I experienced a fair amount of dissociation, at times forgetting who I was and where I was and seeing myself and imagining myself as another person (my friend, oddly enough). At some point, something in me said “GET FOOD AND DRINK” and I went to the vending machines downstairs. I tried to swipe my credit card, but I ran into yet another friend (who is the psychedelic type and has had a lot of experience tripping) and he sat and talked with me about my experience for awhile which calmed me down and gave me some good vibes. Eventually he left and I went back to my sitter and lied down and opened myself up to the experience...

Everything was incredible. Closed eye visuals of fractal towers and fantastic patterns. Purple, loss of dimensions. I couldn't make sense of the ceiling! Colors were everywhere, the world was a rainbow kaleidoscope full of wondrous and whimsical patterns. My body was filled with the most extreme emotions from intense fear and dread to pure ecstasy.

Their appearance is a sort of combination of Lego duplo

**Encountering the Lego People**

Suddenly I found myself in a vastly different place than where Sally had just placed me. It had appeared to me that I was now a part of a different family than my 3D biological one. This family consisted of myself, as the scenario which just took place before I ended up at this place. This was as if I was seeing who I really was in true reality. This family, which I was a part of, was from another galaxy altogether (whether it was in this dimension/universe or one parallel to it was not clear). Every one of us looked kind of inorganic in nature. What I mean by this is that we all looked plastic to a certain extent. We looked more plastic than we did biological...more inorganic than organic. The colours were very pronounced, such as a blue was an extremely vibrant sort of blue, red was an extremely vivid red, and so on. My parents in this different reality explained that it was my actual life and family and that me, have been given a mission to go to the planet earth

There were several of us coming to earth and I had to reassure one of them who felt quite sad about leaving her home and family in this other galaxy/universe. Anyway, which was a 'yes'. I also asked quizzingly, if they were my real parents and that was my true life, what about the vision from my previous salvia trip when I thought it was a past life experience from the late 18th century (it appeared that I was about to duel somebody based on our differences in opinion about something in the articles of confederation if I remember correctly)? The one who was supposedly my father asked ""Don't you remember that you were an outside observer in that vision?"" Indeed, as I recalled it, it did seem like I was an outside observer to the whole event. He them proceeded to tell me that it was not a past life memory of myself, but a look into a small part of history from a unique 3rd person perspective. I believe he was hinting that I was able to see this event that occurred over 200 years ago by accessing the what Ervin Laszlo calls the Akashic Field (A-Field for short).

On the come up, this time a man's voice, but I have no memory of what he actually said. I was told later that the whole time I was hearing these voices and seeing these visuals I was mumbling to myself.  
 
I went inside and sat down on the couch. I have to note here so that it makes sense that I was wearing [this](http://i.imgur.com/cmKTI.png) shirt the whole trip. After we went inside, on wood backgrounds...soon after entire faces were forming everywhere. I could look at the wall behind the television and I could see my own face like I was looking into a camera that's image was being projected 10Xs larger onto the wall. The faces changed, there were all different shapes and sizes, different racial backgrounds. I then laid back on the couch and continually thought in my head ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" after seeing a few more faces, I heard an older woman's voice say in a very hushed tone my name. I said simply replied back ""Yes?"" and she said my name again. I then saw her eyes, nose, and mouth. I was so taken back and for some reason felt love run through my entire body, but I kept reassuring them I was fine
 
My friends went outside to smoke a cigarette so I figured I would see what else I could get out of closed eye visuals while still continually thinking about about reaching out to anything that would listen to me telepathically. After about 2 minutes I saw two faces of what looked like South American shamans. The faces appeared in almost an etching from a grid of green lines. They appeared, except the entire body and face was made of green triangles that were moving the entire time... then I noticed the face changed into my own, except it was like a vision of me if I actually got into shape like I am trying to do now. The ""other"" me locked eyes with me but did not say anything. He slowly started to turn his back to me and once he did he kept looking over his shoulder at me and smiling at me. I kept thinking ""PLEASE SPEAK TO ME!! Please help me achieve this! What do I need to do?"" but he would not say anything, only smile and nod his head at me. I stood up and walked outside to my friend and explained what I had just seen.  
 
After this we all gathered inside and had a silly time. My friend and me wrestled on the floor while giggling like we were 9 year olds who had just seen pro wrestling for the first time in our life. While he went to the bathroom

Btw call GOD what ever you personally name it in this. 

I have had enough experiences that I come to embrace the void within. I have been on a journey to understand that which can not be understood and I come to a place where I need some friendly advice by the few who can not only understand  but feel in every aspect the meanings being the words even if they fail to describe. 


I have passed through the gateless gate of self (but I still know nothing of me of course :) always learning in the abyss of mind). With the help of Salvia and using Cannabis as a lubricant in meditation I have been able to pick apart myself little by little and have come to love me for everything I am(good, the world being you too. That is why love is so important. my perspective runs deep and this is where I need help. There are two sides to the question. 


The First side

I have come to realize that inorder to continue on in my self exploration I have to embrace my godhood yes? This is where I am lost in the abyss of my mind because we are taught that those who say they are god are delusional.... The WORLD Tells you that fact and of course you are the world....  I was an athiest from the moment I first knew about religion. For 25 years God could not exist and then I come to find I am god in this realm

The second side.

Since I was a kid I was always able to ""trance"" myself out and it is only recently that I learned that is what I was doing as a kid. I was always  outside, in our realms we are Gods are we not? We dream like lions.... So then the reverse must be true about our god self, Gods dream like sheep. Its part of understanding eachother within. Then your existence is gods trance(what ever it can be called) yes? you are a thought of god. You are of course still yourself in everyway you are and that you must realize too is beautiful. 

So the point.... 

I am god... I am you... you are me... we are everything....  thoughts of ""something"" within that can not be named.... this being understood we also dream and daydream and let our minds wander for specific reasons. They are messages we give to ourselves (even the most insignificant thought carries a message from your higher self in someway) and as in every ""trance"" the symbols in every existence are OUR own.  Do you see where I am going? Where I am trying to say where my perspective is starting to go? I feel at the edge of waking up to something very big and small at the same time but once I wake this will never be the same. This is where love is important as well. 

Would you or did you or could you?  who ever you are or will be and are not would you continue thinking this way or think you are delusional?

After weeks of reading on the subject my biggest question was: How much should I take for my first time and also experience strong effects? I decided 30mg would do it

Not positive that I was *not* allergic

With my Pink Floyd playlist going (first Dark Side, but restlessness. Halfway through Dark Side of the Moon I noticed the wall next to my bed appeared to be reflecting pale green light. The slight texture on the walls began to move. After this it became increasingly less gradual. *Us &amp; Them* began to play and I felt as though I broke through a membrane of some kind. On the other side of this membrane my room was warm and happy. I couldn't help but smile. My initial focus was on the wall next to my bed. There was a tall lamp with an orange shade shining light on the wall. The wall was a mixture of colors. Green, orange, and blue. I was less focused on the music at this point, although it provided a nice atmosphere for what I was experiencing. I kept going under my blanket and letting the orange light from the lamp shine through it. It was like being in a womb of pulsating patterns. Very small and detailed patterns. Hard to describe. Very much like a mix of a paisley pattern and fractals. All moving and pulsating. I got lost under the blanket and was in complete and total awe of what I was experiencing. This next part is where things get hazy.

Pink Floyd's The Wall started to play. It was joyous. I would go into deep trances of thought, but sad and also full of love and happiness as I felt so much love for my family. When I would ""come to"" I would examine my room and sing along with the music. That was very personal. It was like hearing the album for the first time all over again with a much deeper understanding of the lyrics. Several times I had to turn the volume up loud and bask in the sights and sounds, usually singing along. As I laid in bed the trances became longer and longer. I would come to and hear the music, but have no grasp on what point in the album I had come to. No matter how confused I was by this I could do nothing about it. I could only remain where I was and continue my journey through my thoughts. I began to wonder how long I had been writhing on my bed twisting through my head in seas of closed and open eyed visuals. 

Once I had gotten well into the second disc of *The Wall* I was more conscious of my surroundings in that I was looking around and stuff, dizziness. I happened to get a text from my sister saying, ""Sup."" I called her immediately, but she didn't answer. I sent her a text saying I loved her with a :). I called her again and she answered. At the time I knew why I called her, but was embarrassed and ashamed. I felt foolish for taking as much as I did and not being able to go it alone. I didn't expect to get to this level and I wanted her to come over. Side not: She knew I had this stuff and is somewhat familiar with drugs. She expressed her distaste for my decision and expressed she was worried I would hut myself or someone else under the influence of this drug. ""I hear stuff like that all the time."" she said. So she actually texted me that moment to say she wanted to be there with me when I tried it and was in the process of responding to my text when I called her. She answered and I told her I wanted her to come over. When she asked why I wasn't sure what to say so I didn't say anything. I was afraid to tell her I was in the throws of a powerful psychedelic. I didn't want her to be ashamed or angry. I took a moment trying to find the right words which ended up being the wrong words. I told her not to be mad at me, not to freak out, and that if she wanted to come over to not do so in an alarming manner. She took my being hesitant and short with words as me trying to hide something. She asked if my dad was okay and where was dad. I told he was where he always is that time of night, tired of me using drugs

I sat in my backyard waiting for her to arrive which seemed to take forever. The distant sounds from the highway took on strange tones. As I gazed into the sky I was captivated by one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.

My sister arrived and even though I was looking directly at her her entire face looked distorted and melted. We had a small heart to heart where we shared our feelings with each other. She expressed how having not done any psychedelics before she had no point of reference and could not seem to forget the horror stories she had heard on television. She was scared, finishing with Shine On You Crazy Diamond parts VI-IX. It lulled me into a trance and I spent the rest of the night with my lamp turned off and in total silence. I don't know how long I continued tripping before I finally fell asleep. Constantly journeying through my thoughts and consciousness behind my closed eyes.

I woke up around 7am and was back to baseline. I took a quick stroll through the house to check on my sister and my dad and then went back to sleep.

TL;DR I had my first experience with 4-AcO-DMT, even at that dose as long as I was with another tripper or a sitter. I am definitely going to try again in a couple weeks at a lower dose. ",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,geoball,
1328526131.0,pd1tj,Consciousness and its origins.,Thalamos,22,2,15,"Just came up with this theory

Consciousness was around long before humans. It inhabited ancient animals, it guided this promising new species (that, crucially, had the processing power to possibly accept a larger portion of it than plants or animals) through the transmission of knowledge via psychoactives/altered mind states of which plants to eat, animals to/ways to hunt, which led to the concept of animal and plant spirits. 

After a time it was able to in some small part temporarily sequester parts of itself off in order to inhabit these new meat bodies with their easier way of imprinting on reality via physical means as opposed to directly. 

Over time this newly endowed species became more and more organised and started to lose some of its ancient traits (pack mentality/communication =telepathy

A guide was needed and was answered by the concept of ""God"", Soddom &amp; Gommorah, seas parting, the plagues of egypt etc. 
After the manifestation of Jesus Christ (imbued with some of these powers and an active knowledge of his origins)

More and more people were born, as a human being born without consciousness could no longer survive. So now the parasite is no longer, and a symbiotic relationship has been formed. As world population exploded, the limits of consciousness were pushed to their boundaries with so many brains draining it, magic/druidism/shamanism; forms of traditional manipulation of reality and attempted interaction with the original consciousness stopped being practiced, in the way of the aforementioned telepathy. 

This would explain for the universal oneness among a host of other fascinating phenomena that come out when on psychedelics (telepathy once more!), then his moral direction is able to be divinated, albeit a very alien way of impressing it- this consciousness would not be polluted by flesh or psyche).",,False,self,t5_2szsa,,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/pd1tj/consciousness_and_its_origins/

 Mathematics is the reason behind the perceived ""oneness"" with the universe. This ""oneness"" can be captured in concrete terms with a minor understanding of gravity, but it is an effect nonetheless. This is chaos theory.

The laws of physics are defined as such only if they remain consistent at every place in the universe. Another way to put this is that no matter which way you manipulate the universe, and I really think you should approach this subject and dissertations on it with a heavy grain of salt and a strong dose of skepticism. You will see people's ideas that could have only been the result of a little confusion and a lot of tryptamines; ""mathematical equations"" that read, couldn't make this up, (exi)=(st). No joke, don't get slippery on me, friends, we can make progress but we don't have the time for quackery. I will include a personal favorite list in a suggested order as an introduction to fractals. The math is not hard, and a high school education would be more than enough for it to make sense.

Dosage Range:

5 – 12mg plugged
5 – 20mg smoked plus unknown mg resin hits
10 – 15mg oral

Now I find it important to add that I was not measuring my dosages because I do not own a milligram scale. This is extremely dangerous and I do not recommend anyone do what I did


Comments:


-(6mg, laughs, and extreme relaxation. Food tastes awesome and the drug doesn’t inhibit my appetite. I sleep well around the 9 hour mark. Throughout the night I also smoke repeated doses of synthetic cannabinoid 5f-ur-144.

 
-(8mg plugged, about 20 min after the smoked dose. Anxiety and body load take over, with lots of nausea. I end up puking around the 45 min mark. After puking, I feel much better and the MDMA-ish “rolling” feeling takes over with markedly more trippiness. Empathy is mild, but there, and I spend the night mostly in good spirits. I also smoke several doses of 5f-ur-144 throughout the night. Sleep comes easily after about 8 hours after the oral dose.

 
-(2, resin hit dose): Intense dysphoria and panic reaction only a few minutes after exhaling the hit. I am sure I did too much immediately. Little to no visuals, and almost no psychedelia to be found. Body high feels like strobing pulses which begin at my heart and reach to my extremities. They are extremely uncomfortable. Doom thoughts of having a seizure and/or heart attack take over and I find it impossible to calm myself down. Heart rate is noticeably high. Effects ease after 10 minutes or so and I fall asleep feeling exhausted and drained. Muscle contractions and involuntary movement was prevelant until sleep. Lots of “oh god” moments where I’m definitely out of control and freaking out. Plugged doses were at the 0 minute mark and the 4 hour mark. Smoked doses were throughout the night, but the last resin hit was around the 8 hour mark. I also used 5f-ur-144 throughout the night.

 
-Other notable experiences: I experienced another mild OD occuring after plugging a 10 – 12mg dose and smoing throughout the night with 5f-ur-144. After a resin hit

So
I'm watching the walls breathe, so there a lot of people watching the race and a lot of runners, and there were a TON of sail boats on the water, by now my shrooms are in full affect. We sit right on the waters edge in quiet and just watch the water and all the different visuals we are getting.
Since we had quite a few shrooms we both start to get a little uncomfortable outside so we decide to go back. We cannot ride a board at this point lol, but I'm obviously still able to compose myself. Everything looked like I was watching a movie, like there were no dimensions. I'm staring at the ground and I see typical repeating patterns, the same pile of rocks with each step, so it felt like I was getting nowhere. We get back, and my trip is going HARDCORE. Closed eye visuals, I saw a lot of stuff lol. Crazy scenes were playing out in my mind. I was literally watching a claymation movie in my mind, these dolls were popping in and out of the ground, my entire life, not that it matters
I sleep on the couch at L's, sit around for about an hour and a half, and decide to take a tab of acid (again, around 9:30).
20 minutes later this trip sinks in while I'm in my living room. Everything looks kind of kaleidoscopic, and then I go home and start drawing and painting in my sketchbook for the first time in years. It felt so great to create something so beautiful, it seemed like my true artistic abilities were coming out.
I realize at this point I want to take up art again and let it build. Now, and I take my third one. I feel so amazed by everything, everything is so beautiful, I literally cannot contain myself. We go on a walk with our friend D (he took a tab too) and we just walk around and look at everything and talk about whatever comes to mind. We get back to my apartment around 7ish, and we watch some simpsons and paint and draw and make more art. We are all having the best times of our lives. I go in my room and meditate for about 15 minutes. I am just sitting there, thinking about how I feel like a completely new person, like I died on saturday and I was reborn with all of my past fears and inhibitions and insecurities all behind me. I just start crying on my bed about how much I love myself and who I am and how I am going to be happy now. After that, I finally go to bed around 3
I am so happy today, I am so grateful for my experience. I feel like my third eye is open, like I found true happiness, and my purpose in life is to make myself happy before trying to please others.

I plan on making a tea out of probably 18 inches. I plan on throwing away the core but I was wondering if I should keep the white tissue

I also plan on ingesting 3 Datura seeds and some Harmaline.

Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.


10:57AM:
Today's the day, which I tried to get only the green skin, but still had some white tissue left on. The foot long section was the entire cactus, with the core. I blended each piece after cutting them up along with water, then filtered it. At the beginning I tried to add more water and blended again after I filtered the first part, but the blender only blended the bottom so for the rest I only filtered it once. (Squeezing the water pulp in a cloth) After I got all the liquid separated from the pulp I tried to boil it, but keeping the temp below 170, I'm gonna jump in the shower and get in the right head space

I've had only a tangerine and half an apple and I'm going to try to stay away from eating until into the trip.
I tried to identify the cactus to make sure it was San Pedro this morning but I wasn't able to tell if it is Trichocereus pachanoi or Trichocereus pachanot (PC San Pedro)

11:14AM:
I threw back 200mg of Harmaline and chased it down with water. My first step on the journey. I'm going to wait 30 minutes before I start drinking.

11:45:
Cheers! I've put on some light psyambiet and have taken my first sip and at first was not that bad, unpleasent taste for a couple seconds. It isn't exactly horrible, but I can't see how someone could just chug this much down. I've started to feel 'different' right before I stated to drink it. I'm definitely feeling some head oriented effects, but they must be placebo or just from getting into this set and setting. I'm going to try to drink the rest by throwing a straw down the back of my throat and passing my tongue.

11:51
Getting up to walk around definitely enhances this weird head space. Some light disorientation is definitely there, but I felt fine before. No visual effects or thought changes, so it must just be one of the most powerful placebos I have ever felt. Not really sure to worry or to give in. Back to drinking. 

Maybe it's just the SP settling in my stomach, minus the thoughts. 

Thought I was going to throw up, kinda waving back and forth, left and right. But when I stop it also stops. I'm hearing buzzing from electronics more than usual. Not sure how much I'm going to drink. Happy thoughts.

12:07: Threw up

Got a rough road ahead

1:41PM: I went to go lay on the couch and rest when I threw up again. I feel asleep

2:34PM: I slept some more and I'm feeling better. Walking around makes it all more uncomfortable. I'm just laying down for now and am just going to chill for the rest of the day

For now on, unless they're hidden beneath the sickness. I drank about half a glass, and I think there was about one - 1 1/2 glasses worth left, but I can't bare to look at the pitcher of urine like mescaline. 

3:56PM: Feeling better, or if it was just the nausea of the San Pedro, I can't see how you can enjoy the trip while the first half is with nausea. If I ever do this again, I'm definitely going to cut out the white tissue and have some datura seeds with it.

I sat down on my bed, every vibration in my body, as if it’s connection with the mind was finally felt and my self felt whole again, harmonized, aligned with the rest of the universe, without a worry.

There was still an idea of self-awareness, the loss of any egocentric taught. No need to think about myself, there is a oneness, a structure, like a puzzle, where every particle fits in perfectly. My mind was just part of this realm, harmonized with all other matter in this specific place in space-time. Body sensations were incredible and seemingly intertwined with the ecstatic mind set.

The universe is felt subjectively, it is a specific point whereas all sensory inputs are great and the mind is opened to its fullest, thereby harmonizing the physical and the mental world, bridging the last gap between the body and the “soul”. It's an experience to be lived, as the idea comes from deep within your head, not from the physical realm.

I do believe now that perfection exists, and it can be achieved in any ""chemical"" state. Once it is realized/discovered, it's a place that, with practice, can be reached no matter the situation. Once harmony is achieved, that you understand your inner self and your outer self align, along with the rest of the universe,,True,t3_oqneu

I'm someone who deals with chronic pain and a severe mood disorder. I've been hospitalized 3 times for suicidal ideation and for an attempt over the course of a year.

It has only recently dawned on me that when I procured some psilocybin from a friend (a half oz for free - so awesome of him) that I could really use a trip and hopefully use it to my advantage. 

I have read many studies on how psilocybin affects mood disorders and PTSD in a positive way so I decided to give it a shot. I have been warned not to use mushrooms when you are depressed but it is in my humble opinion that if I am ready to make the ultimate self sacrifice then why not go for a trip

I've only had 1 trip so far but am planning on the second one soon. I took just 1 gram on an empty stomach. I experienced a wide range of emotions

The next day and for the next two months was... me again. My ""old"" self. I haven't felt so happy just because in so many years! As I suspected my *pain diminished* as well. Before the trip I was at a level 7 pain

1371202406.0,1gbuu3,Help me understand a really intense LSD trip,sulphuricacid,18,3,9,"I have dropped acid a few times before but 2 nights ago I took the biggest hit so far - 300ug. I have never hallucinated so intensely.
So visually all I could see were these really fast moving streams of multicoloured lights. Which didn't have a source or end, trees and open sky).  Actually, I realised that the only way I could see my surroundings is by looking for this particular kind of distortion that 'real' objects produced on this moving streams of electro-ish lights. 
Auditory hallucination - I could only hear sounds in loop
The weirdest part was that I felt a constant light right above my head (I couldn't figure out if it was emanating from me or if it was just sitting there). If I concentrated on it too much then my entire body would be sort of pulled upwards - my shoulders were pulled upwards till it hurt, life energy or something was being pulled upwards and outwards as well. I resisted this though as it was so unpleasant and uncontrollable.  
This is all the stuff happening outside, was at another level altogether. I saw really intense tracers. So at one point after constantly moving my hand towards and away from my face (remember the whole time I can only 'see' things because they are distorting the light stream in a particular way) and after some contemplation I remember remarking 'I can see the time-space continuum'. 
I also write a bunch of stuff down - still trying to understand all of it. 
Some of it (unedited) is - 
""There is no meaning there is only the making of""
""No thought process is static. There is no singe idea everything moves in streams of information and our senses can only perceive one way of it existing and the way it communicates with each other. But each of the senses are at the end dimensionless.
""The act of communicating is just you deciding what is real.""
""All of us are just products of a package of dynamic information
The greatest fallacy - is to think that you can actually understand another's place - situationally, it is your perception of reality (for example it really smells right now) what others think of you, what they think of themselves, and how this complexity of information is what we are trying to make sense of at the end of the day. ""

Everyone should be able to exist in a form that allows them to make sense of their surroundings. 
Everything that you feel right now is a process of a multitude of information flowing in a direction
And our existence is a signature which is constantly moving, since you are at the same time, constantly being changed by it and constantly changing it, but it is at the same time unique as it is a culmination of information around you perceived in those manners 
Eternity is all around. But the attempt to understand it reduces it constantly. 
Communication is how we determine our position in existence

Why acid makes sense – it is a state of existence that allows you to choose what perceptions you think are important for your reality at that point in space and time (so for example this requires verification because the only way you can make sense of things is based on whether other people are perceiving similar things in similar ways?)
The fallacies (?) – universality (more in terms of generalizations) and importance
The problem – why are we nodes of interpretation sent out into the universe to make sense of things in a particular way (which we can say is determined by identifiers such as gender, or genetics (which seems the most probable but I don’t really know why right now), .
We will always look for meaning and a source and an end. 
What didn't make sense – needs. Everyone clearly has them
What really didn't make sense – self doubt

You perpetually move forward, look back to see the long years of your life, then look forward and know what is waiting for you. Days become weeks become months become years becoming and going til they all slide by as if they had somewhere to be. They wait for no one, especially you, as the hands keep on turning and the tide keeps on rolling in. Where does the time go, where were you when it was here? 

Time goes nowhere you haven't been. It sits, content with its unwavering stare. Meanwhile you divide it up, marking it left and right, figuring out how to spend it. You sell it like a commodity and then wait for it when you have no more left. You breathe it in and spit it out when you've used it up, taking it for granted. It doesn't care though, because what are you, to it? Just another short lived fly

Is time alive? Can time think and feel? What does it mean to truly live? Can you see it, if they have no meaning? Can you even know what time is?

Time is every moment you've ever lived up to now – everything you've ever done or said, the wrinkles on your hand. Time is August 30th, 1984 when U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery takes off on its maiden voyage. Time is the Gregorian calender, the hourglass, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. 

Time is the frame of everything around us

The time you have is a blessing.

The time you've lost is a curse.

You live to die and die to live, growing mentally. You expand and develop, teaming with an aura of sentience in everything you do. You stabilize, your actions become habits and your habits become your life, unfolding in unavoidable circumstance. You wait, bracing yourself for the inevitable collapse of your own ruin. You die, decaying physically, shrinking into the creases of your skin

It's the supposed time limit which makes life so precious. Life without death isn't life at all. This value of life creates a value of self

The world is spinning. You look up and see everyone else, the footsteps taking you to and from the corners of living. At one point these people tried to live, now they just try to survive. You realize that time stops for no one. We're swarmed by a wave of bullshit, dictating what can and cannot be, surrounded by an endless pressure to conform. Cut your hair short, put on makeup, take your pills

And all this time

Someone at my school got hit by a fucking car. Someone I knew overdosed alone in their apartment. Someone I met took a bullet in the chest in Afghanistan and never came back. Someone I saw hung themselves out of desperation. Someone's Grandfather just died

Their family

and here we are, listening to music, pissed over something so trivial but right now it seems so important. Time is the devourer of all things, it flies and ends unexpectedly, even though it continues on without you. Life is the time you hold closest to you. Your life makes up this time through the will of the surface values of your conscious mind. Live your life, live your time, live your mind, eat,,False

1343637192.0,xdte9,(X-post psychonaut) POLL: Personality percentages of this subreddit using the MBTI scale.,,14,1,44,"Hello

- **Introverted/extroverted**

Almost all of the psychonauts I have met that have used the MBTI scale are introverts.
We should take into account how the computer attracts introverts so we should expect almost all poll takers to be introverted

&gt;  *Extraverted Characteristics*

&gt; - Act first

&gt; - Feel deprived when cutoff from interaction with the outside world

&gt; - Usually open to and motivated by outside world of people and things

&gt; - Enjoy wide variety and change in people relationships


&gt;  *Introverted Characteristics*

&gt; - Think/reflect first

&gt; - Regularly require an amount of ""private time"" to recharge batteries

&gt; - Motivated internally

&gt; -  Prefer one-to-one communication and relationships


- **Intuitive/Sensing**

I am not sure about this one
I am interested in the results here.


&gt; *Sensing Characteristics*

&gt; - Mentally live in the Now

&gt; - Using common sense and creating practical solutions is automatic-instinctual

&gt; - Memory recall is rich in detail of facts and past events

&gt; - Best improvise from past experience

&gt; - Like clear and concrete information; dislike guessing when facts are ""fuzzy""

&gt;  *Intuitive Characteristics*

&gt; - Mentally live in the Future

&gt; - Using imagination and creating/inventing new possibilities is automatic-instinctual

&gt; - Memory recall emphasizes patterns

&gt; - Best improvise from theoretical understanding

&gt; - Comfortable with ambiguous


- **Thinking/Feeling**

More commonly we see thinking psychonauts


&gt;  *Thinking Characteristics*

&gt; - Instinctively search for facts and logic in a decision situation.

&gt; - Naturally notices tasks and work to be accomplished.

&gt; - Easily able to provide an objective and critical analysis.

&gt; - Accept conflict as a natural

&gt; *Feeling Characteristics*

&gt; - nstinctively employ personal feelings and impact on people in decision situations

&gt; - Naturally sensitive to people needs and reactions.

&gt; - Naturally seek consensus and popular opinions.

&gt; - Unsettled by conflict; have almost a toxic reaction to disharmony.


- **Perceiving/Judging**

Perceiving people are more likely to ""go with the flow"" ""live in the moment"" however we see many Judgers interested in looking at how personality works and finding their own ways to  be interested in the mind.
This one can be a mix bag and I am not sure if either one will be out numbered significantly.

&gt;  *Perceiving Characteristics*

&gt; - Comfortable moving into action without a plan; plan on-the-go.

&gt; - Like to multitask

&gt; - Naturally tolerant of time pressure; work best close to the deadlines.

&gt; - Instinctively avoid commitments which interfere with flexibility

&gt;  *Judging Characteristics*

&gt; - Plan many of the details in advance before moving into action.

&gt; - Focus on task-related action; complete meaningful segments before moving on.

&gt; - Work best and avoid stress when able to keep ahead of deadlines.

&gt; - Naturally use targets

I strongly believe that I suffered from nerve damage due to the things I did to myself

I had a fabulous experience with acid that cured a cocaine addiction, what we can also deduce is that we are interconnected. Sometimes I feel so close to the others around me that it hurts. I was a very isolated child, and I'm still very withdrawn. I'm more and more open and positive each day, though it can be very taxing letting people know that you don't want to deal with negativity. The Buddhist principle of the ocean of suffering is pervasive at times, though there is an ocean of amazing bliss as well. I try my best to generate positive thoughts and ideas, although my family at times seems irreparably negative and a bad influence. It can be difficult to transition thoughts that were once negative In the context of a flawed perception and correct them when you've thought about them and seethed and lamented for years. Memories conjured by faces. That sort of thing.

Let me put it a different way: I'm new to this. I had to go get my driver's license the other day, fortunately, no tickets, no arrests. I just drive sort of recklessly but it's getting easier. It's just that the residual effects of tripping have caused me to have time dilation like a mofo, and I get honked at when the light turns green, or I go when the other side turns green. I know there are blinders on the perpendicular street signals for a reason; I find it challenging not to try and beat the system, and get my ass handed to me for not implementing the plan correctly. On the other hand, and by no means am I an aggressive driver (On a straightaway I may gun it but I've mastered the inertia of letting up on the accelerator so as to chill out at 5 over). May make some people nervous blasting rap music or whatever. It's just interesting that the thing that is affected the most is my driving.

Do you see? It can really be a challenge to relate to people. I run into certain people who I effortless can lock eyes with without feeling nervous. The other social graces that go along with participating in society are still rough around the edges

It was lightly drizzling outside

I am greeted by two of my buddies, nervously shaking for what I was anticipating. My friend, B, could see I was nervous. We spent the next twenty minutes discussing my anxieties and my expectations. I knew what I wanted to get out of the experience, and I knew WHY I wanted these things. I wanted to see some sort of objectivity; I felt as though I was drifting from my core, and needed some sort of knowledge that would assist me in becoming a better person. I had recently begun feeling more distant from family, and was beginning to have a sort of existential crisis. I was an atheist and had no belief or disbelief in any deity or afterlife, so I decided to do some inward exploring. This is where DMT came into the picture. 

My friend B knew how to extract DMT from Mimosa hostilis root-bark powder, I did research on the substance and read experience reports. I wanted to go into this as over prepared as possible. Little did I know, it would not matter how much I knew about it, it would still be just as intense and flabbergasting. 

Back to the side of the bed: my friend B asks if I am ready. I tell him I'm as ready as I think I'll ever be. He puts a very small cannabis bud at the bottom of the bowl, and he puts the lighter near the crystals. He is very careful not to burn anything, just melt and vaporize. I fill up the pipe, and inhale. The taste and smell are ancient. The plastic-like taste runs through my whole body. As alien as this is to me, I take another hit. This particular hit kicked things up a few notches: objects became more vibrant, matter was lightly pulsating, and this electronic hum in the air became significantly louder than normal. I had to take about 20 seconds to let it marinade. As I sit there, and B withdrew to give me room to lay down. The electronic hum became even more loud, made me want to undo what I did. But I quickly forgot about my feelings, reds

My mindscape revealed itself to me to be related to matter, have interactions with beings. It was still not something a first-timer can mentally prepare for. These self-tessellating patterns began morphing into hominid shapes. Three beings appeared out of the infinity, what felt like right in front of me. In retrospect, it was INSIDE of me. They still retained several qualities of my mindscape: they were still tessellated next to eachother (even though they seemed to be of a higher dimension), and their “faces” were taking the form of something my mind could understand. I still remember their original forms: wide and happy grins, pitch black eyes, short bodies made of a seemingly unknown energy to me. But this original form soon became replaced with what my mind could make sense of: family. I saw my mothers face, and my uncles face. They were, trying to sooth me and let me know everything was alright. 

Once I came to peace with my experience, I instantly remembered that I had inhaled DMT. My sober mind started to rise, and I could see things very clearly. I was shaking with excitement, and was rushing through my previous 5 minutes so I could remember as much as I could. I started analyzing every feeling I had during my “trip”, and tried to make sense of everything. As alien as the experience felt WHILE it was happening, I could not shake the sense of familiarity once I came back. It felt like I had been there before, a long

I had come to a few conclusions about my experience at the time, when I inhaled DMT I was reprogramming my brain to use different energy as input: energy coming from within instead of from the outside world. In my opinion, the beings I interacted with were a constuct of the human psyche, possibly ancient. This would also explain why almost everyone who experiences DMT has contact with some sort of sapient entity. 

This is where I will wrap up my experience in a nutshell: beginning of spring, went over my goals in my head (wanting to become more aware and connected with things that matter), took 3 large hits in a time span of a few minutes, objects morphed and folded, colors became more intense, déjà vu became more frequent, free will dissolved, nervousness inevitably subsided, realized how loving and awesome my family is, the weather being promising

1354904302.0,14ge0r,Developing higher dimensional consciousness through archetypes and subjective mythos.,tr0798,11,2,3,"**Assumption 1: Anything that can be imagined exists somewhere in the infinite (or near infinite) universes of the multiverse.** (If there are an infinite number of universes, etc.) exist in at least one of the infinite universes.) 



**Assumption 2: Higher dimensional information can be encoded into a lower dimensional substrate.** (Holographic plates are an example of this principle at work



**Assumption 3: The brain can be such a substrate





**Myth as archetypal maps for subjective understanding of one’s own neural connections (experienced as the landscape of mind).**
   

The human brain is hard-wired to work with myth – archetypal maps by which the internal landscape of mind can be navigated. When a psychonaut, or other explorer of the inner world begins to work with myth, the archetypal characters and places are crude and undeveloped – not much can be understood or predicted using such simplistic mappings. As the explorer begins to create more elaborate details, interconnecting different elements of their mythos, their brain correspondingly becomes more interconnected. Myth becomes the language by which the internal world of the subconscious can engage in dialogue with the conscious mind, with archetypal imagery as the words, and events occurring within the mythos as the syntactical/grammatical contextualization. Archetypal characters and places become the means by which the explorer identifies and maps neural circuits of different parts of the brain, the overall story is the aggregate of all neural circuits and connections that have so far been mapped. 




**Archetypal/mythos mapping as encoding of higher dimensional geometries into the 3d neural substrate.**


Holographic plates store information in such a way that the information of the whole plate is equally represented in each part, if you cut a holographic plate in half, each half can still construct the entire image intact, though with less detail. The brain exhibits a similar property in that if large sections of the brain are destroyed, or become disconnected from each other, memories can still be retrieved, though with less detail. It could be said that a 4d spacetime image of events are stored into a 3d neural substrate; in other words, it is as if each neuron has an “address book” for each other neuron that was activated during a particular experience. The memory is retrieved as the activation of a neuron’s “address book” for that particular experience. Thus


As the mythos develops, and are 4d informational encodings onto the 3d neural substrate. Extrapolating from what is known about holograms, it could be understood that higher dimensional information is encoded into a lower dimensional substrate by the interconnection of all points on the lower dimensional substrate to each other. Just as an archetypal image itself is an “address book“ of the different neurons involved in encoding the image, so would events in a mythos be an “address book” of the archetypal “address books”. In other words, the individual events in the explorer’s subjective mythos are the extension of neural holography into the next higher dimension, 5d. The overall story arc of individual events in the mythos would correspond to a 6d “address book” of 5d encoded information, and so on. 




**Inner mapping becomes outer mapping.**

As the higher dimensional interconnections of the holographic neural network increase in density and number, allowing for exploring other universes in the multiverse or even gaining information from the 3/4d universe in which an explorer’s body resides that would normally be inaccessible (for example, a person in 2d flatland would be amazed by how a 3d person standing above him could tell him what is outside the walls of the 2d flatlander’s rooms). Thus, when a shaman consults the “spirits” (archetypal images) for information about where a lost item is, divining the future, or some other prophetic act, the shaman is utilizing higher dimensional interconnections and schema about the world to gain information from the 3/4d world. 


In some sense, theatre, film, etc. all can be conceived of as higher dimensional perceptions of other universes in the multiverse, with the information brought back to this universe. So, I propose that stories such as “Star Wars” actually did exist a long time ago, in a galaxy far, and can request information from other hyperspatial


Bringing it back full circle, they are imagining things. But as the imaginings become more elaborate and interconnected, they begin to touch something real, as the explorer truly does peer with his/her own consciousness into other universes.

**Trip Plans:**

Originally I had planned on ingesting everything in my vehicle then get out to hike a specific section of the Appalachian Trail til I got to an elevated clearing where I could setup camp and ride the spiral... with no trip sitter.

Instead


**Setting:**

* My house
* Roommate is at work
* Some traffic noise from road in front of house
* Some train rumbling and occasional whistle from the tracks near the house
* Minor noise from Neighbors moving in


**The Trip:**


*Note: I had fasted for 18 hrs and I was not focused on any single thing for my trip which I think was a mistake*


  I drank the Rue Tea at 11:40 am on Sat and waited till 12 noon to take the encapsulated DMT. For the first 1.5 hours(12-1:30pm) I was sitting at my desktop doing things online but all I could feel was the body load from the Rue I decided to lay down and put on some music.
 

 I put on [Tapha Niang](http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS499US499&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=tapha+niang&amp;sugexp=chrome
By 2pm I was having intense CEVs(Closed Eye Visuals) that eventually escalated to OEVs(Open eye Visuals). 
 

 From 2pm - 4:30 is a blur I do know the peak happened around 3:15 and lasted to 4:20 where the trip was as intense and other worldly as vaporized DMT. 
  

The theme of my trip mainly consisted of the idea of the individual and our place in the universe. I remember having a mini freak out about not being able to be self sufficient in the event that the planet Earth decided to reject humans (like our body's rejecting transplants after surgery). It was a crazy idea
 

 Around 4pm when I got off my bed and moved around a little my brains personal link to the body was just not there. The hand I was seeing was just a hand
 

 It occurred to me about 40 minutes later when I was more me
  

I started to come down around 4:30pm but the visuals didn't leave till about 5:20pm and I was back to normal at 5:45pm.


**Notes:**

* The trip was very visual
* I now understand why a lot of rituals are performed or go into the night. The visuals are much more vivid in the dark.
* I did not experience a purge and the nausea was very minor. I account this to the time I spent with the Rue preparation.
* Next time I will definitely use more DMT,False,self,t5_2szsa,1352137628.0,,interconnect,t3_12ocof

1356860580.0,15o2tq,First psychedelic experience! 4-HO-MET,M_G,10,0,6,"I had never done any drugs before tonight, in hopes that it might alleviate my depression. So someone I know was able to acquire a good 100mg of 4-HO-MET  after I told them about it

I took about 13mg (orally) first, and I noticed that the colors were more beautiful than I'd seen before! I noticed all the colors that form the rainbow were present, which was a recurring theme throughout the trip. We went inside after a bit and turned on some Blue Angel Lounge and watched the last Lord of the Rings movie (everything looked very distorted, Elrond and Aragorn's eyes and foreheads looked bulgy and pulsating and had a green hue to them), which was FUCKING AMAZING! I really noticed how pretty the movie was as I was watching it. After this, we went back outside and the sun was starting to set. We were looking at clouds in the sky and I started seeing the geometric shapes in the sky; triangles in the sky, squares in the clouds, where we played with a ball python. I held it for some time and felt like he became part of me, very euphoric and interesting. Noticed the patterns in the stars, there was a clear feeling of ""doneness""

In retrospect, but that it was helping me to see things that I had just never taken the time to see or hear before. I felt extremely close to nature and gained some valuable insights about myself, and I feel motivated to change some of my ways for the better and to live life more. All in all, fantastic. I would definitely try 4-HO-MET again.

**Good effects:**

* Patterns
* Color/sense enhancement
* Heightened sense of awareness
* Ego loss
* Expansion of thought/consciousness
* Feeling of closeness to nature
* Breathing
* Melting
* Mild/faint open eye visuals (runes on totems and double helixes in the sky)
* Euphoria
* Excitement
* Lightness in body

**Neutral Effects:**

* Dreamlike and childlike sense of reality
* Distorted sense of time
* Dilated pupils
* Mild hypoglycemia (I am a type 1 diabetic)
* Hunger

**Negative Effects:**

* Thirst and mild dehydration
* Some muscle tension
* Loss of balance (was actually kind of fun)

We clear landmass by inadvertently killing alot of the weed growth around the paths we walk allowing sufficient sunlight penetration to the ground. Furthermore the dead weeds i could immagine would be great for extra bacterial growth to help cultivate the process.

If my observations are correct then its a wonderful coincidence that mushrooms would have a high growth potential wherever animals and humans 'graze' as multiple walks along the same paths would need to be undertaken in order to sufficiently clear the shrubbery growth along the ground.

One time a foul intoxicating alien force got bypass The Royal Guard of The Blood-Brain Barrier, The Mad Memetic Demon-Prince Of Self Mutilation, who appears to have been lying dormant within our Royal Temple, disguised as Macabre Curiosity, never much liked but granted a seat at the Royal High Council nevertheless, and as soon as the Demon was unleashed, it hazed our brave musculoskeletal troops into driving Sharp Objects into the lines of our own border guard. It took a few days before our safety mechanisms (most notably the No Pain Protocol) would activate and vanquish the foul demon-prince from the Royal Throne Room, terminate the wantonly spreading illegal immigrants which got into our midsts when the border guard was compromised, but in our dreams we can still sometimes see the rivers of blood... We have now caged the demon


Another horror story from our past was in the horrible bloody age of Anorexia, all for the Lich-King’s vain amusement and blatant disregard for the well beings of his subjects. For months we let this alien aesthetic ruin our peace and disrupt The Homeostasis. It is thanks to our determined behavioral guerilla warfare experts in the Binge Eating regiment which were able to thwart the evil Lich-King’s plans, so that our Sanity Corps had enough time to plan their attack and eventually drive out the alien influences from the True Royal Gallery Of Beauty and from The Holiest Throne Room Of The Brain itself...


Those, for we have now achieved a sense of Unity like no before. We are many and one. We all trust each other, and have figured out a way to differentiate friend from foe. It has allowed us to prosper beyond all our imaginations. Every day now we are basking in abundant nutrients, in just the right temperature, enjoying the safety and comfort of a well exercised modern army, and generally just feeling well.


It is in this abundance that we have found the time to direct our studies to the more esoteric subjects of Herbalism, to name a few. It is our belief that a lot of good can be gained from these technologies, and already we have found new levels of feeling healthy with these technologies. It is with health that we can acquire ever more health.


Which brings us to the purpose of this message:


I, The Most Enlightened And All-Loving Protector of The Body, on behalf of my subjects, collectively known as The Sovereign Body Of Yuka (in finnish: *Jukan Itsenäinen Keho*, or *Jukka*), also known as The Head *Lärvi*, The Torso *Pötsi*, The Hand *Kohtuus*, would wish to enter in an exchange of technological knowledge, who are not intent on consuming us or our resources. Do you know how to live forever


PS: Conversely, you gonna have to deal with the all of us! We are strong! Do not fuck with us! BOOYAH!

now that I've seen/experienced transcendental one-ness

and had what i can only assume was ego death as i felt no cares, now what? i know i am you and you are me and god is one and we are e for wee reach oneness, enter the void and begin gain, ready to argue with ones self instead of moving on, again...such is Penn and teller explaining the universes funniest joke, Siegfried and Roy, Jesus and Judas, etc, ignore him.""

the big thing now is...who do i share the knowledge with? i have all the answers, that also legitimately wants to help people, because i don't have the teeth or  charisma for it.


so when you know what i know, we all hold these truths to be self evident and they are, to ourselves, but not other's because the awareness is only 60% out of [1-0] or only 250 degrees on an oven set to 500, etc.   i hope you can understand the ways in which i mean this with using such fractional thought patterns.

so my question is........if i' you and your me and we are all the universe experiencing itself subjectively is it the job of the googolplox's of me's in different universes  throughout all of not history to just be the stoner, everyone going yeah yeah yeah, and then lightening up, while still ignoring the stoned guy? is that the lot in the circular circuit that is the improbability drive of the shuttle holding all of earths dna, running  scenario after scenario to see if we could ever repopulate and not wreck shit like we did before....and if so/not why wont anyone listen to anyone who wants to help? why is it always the enxt big fuck up in charge, the next big bomb dropper, the next big war....what the actual fuck guys? we're in 2012 now, i've seen an oil catastrophe that nobody talks about anyore. i see people being killed for no reason for some reason for a good reason and for shit reasons...why can't we all just get along?

To begin with, and have been using drugs for a little over three years- psychedelics for two of them. I have tried a handful of prescriptions, plenty of weed, mushrooms, lsd, MDMA, n, 4 HO-MET, and a handful of other drugs I can't remember off the top of my head. Usually 1.75 grams of cubensis don't push me to this level. Yesterday
It was an overcast, I am going to replace my name with A. My two closest companions J and D were with me, D (also J's girlfriend) had come into town a couple of days ago (Thursday night actually) to see J (my roommate). We had all planned originally on going to J's home and take mushrooms in the woods, but various circumstances kept us from leaving. D tripped on Friday by herself (her first trip!) and J and I trip sat. Watching her discover all of the things that I love about Mushroom made my inhibitions about tripping melt away. When the the next day dawned warm enough to go outside, and strangely quiet for our part of town, I decided it was high time to commune and go home. I asked J if he wanted to join me- he said yes. After a quick thank you to the spirit, I ate around 1.25 g of mushrooms, I filled out this month's rent check, letters and writing in general. By the time the check was in the envelope, I was soaked to the bone
Rain drunk from apple blossoms tasted sweet. We arrived home, feeling the strands of reality reaching down into me and flowing into the earth. I picked dandelions. I sat down for a good while on the stairs, watching CEV's go by. I moved to the deck. I placed the dandelions in puddles so they could drink, and sat down among them, and let myself go again.
I began chanting, celebrating the earth and the loss of my self- I was just the universe, awareness, doing many things. Another of my roommates came out and talked to me for a while, gave me a couple hits of white widow, which sent me deeper into relaxing no-self. He went back inside after what seemed like an hour (I'm sure it was much shorter).
I followed him after another ten minutes or so. I went to the bathroom and stripped off my wet clothes, it stared back. I could see all of the things that were attached to it, this thing that called itself ""A"". It was so weird, so lanky and squishy and clunky and organic and beautiful- it put so much work into itself! So much! ""I"" loved it just because it looked so lonely, but tried so, so hard to be good. Its eyes made me cry, they had so much feeling in them. The tears came out of it, leaving A to itself.
To the bedroom. The body awareness possessed suddenly gained womanly curves- feminine energy poured through, it suddenly fell back into this male, ginger shell. So much for that- but a beautiful experience! It left the bedroom, and piloted the body into the bedroom of J, where J and D were cuddling, and happy to smoke some hash oil that I provided. J and I compared notes so far- he asked me if I had found my name, I said I learned that I don't need a name. He said, maybe not, man."" Ha! Day. Time. What a joke. The A delusion was receding again. Good. More time to be. It piloted the body over to the desk and slumped in J's chair. Closing the eyes produced wonderful thought processes. The mushroom and awareness took a walk through the mind that it normally inhabits and calls A. We looked around at the dreary mess. The mushroom turned to leave, the belly laugh of the cosmos. I planted some flowers next to the entrance of the mind-house. They looked like sea plants
After a good several minutes, something larger was going to be necessary. A was pushed aside. A partition was created. A bubble formed in my head- ""give it Tikal"" - and it filled with another awareness, another, older self. A was taken aback. Calming A, Tikal explored. Terrifyingly intelligent and wise, every action and statement, every movement was both the most serious and thought out thing, less merciful. This made awareness quickly grab A again, in a partially expressed form. And then there's... ""me"", and to throw out what is unnecessary. Though this is not truly/fully Tikal

         While watching Brave, manages to prove to her mother that she's been wrong her whole life, and embrace rather than resist awakening.  5 Year Engagement caught my empathy by putting myself in the place of the male protagonist - thus simulating my life if I had acted the way in which the male protagonist did.  His behavior resulted in an engagement to a woman he loved being delayed due to educational aspirations separating them by radically reducing the amount of time they were able to spend together.  While the male protagonist un-realizingly (yet sub-consciously aware; at least when I walked in his shoes) started giving up on the relationship, leading to him not worrying about doing things for her, not taking care of himself, and overall just emotionally neglecting his fiancee during the small amount of time they found together, they started growing a great deal apart.  This emotional separation naturally lead to both members of the couple seeking an activity or subject to fill the created gap.  The replacement for the male protagonist seemed to be becoming a sort of partial hippie/out-cast, the female fiancee ended up kissing another person who ended up spending more time with her due to educational obglications.  Explaining other one would take too much time .. here's an OVERVIEW

The bottom line to the bottom part of above message is saying act on instinct and emotion - don't overthink to try and fit into an accepted pattern.  If your pattern it outside of the norm, thanks to experience, now being that love is supreme.  And because it's supreme, take it VERY seriously rather than being stubborn and not compromising in the name of sacred love.  This love has done nothing but improve my life since I've accepted it into my heart rather than somehow fearing it.

1329302166.0,pqk27,My bad trip,bad--trip,4,1,1,"If this is the wrong subreddit (is there a right one?) let me know and I’ll post it there instead.

I smoke weed quite occasionally, relaxed, slower breathing etc. I ‘ve only had one other bad trip, but it was a party, with a heavy amount of drinking and a very untrustworthy joint, which I always assumed was tainted with something else.  In decades this was my only other bad trip.  I typed it out when I sobered up to remember it clearly in the future, to share and also as physical proof of it happening.  Even after this I may smoke again, maybe partial joints

It’s also interesting to note

Sorry it’s a mess of gibberish, but here’s what I’ve written so far:

To start 

Incredibly bad trip.  Went from laughing fit and fun watching Beavis and Butthead to suddenly realizing how high I was.  Decided to stop watching Beavis and Butthead, and who I actually was.  Went through hours of existential identify crisis trying to remember who I was and what was real.  The 'trips' got shorter and shorter as I'd touch or feel something (such as the bed, my arm etc) and suddenly become aware that, that was my physical self and the previous trip was in my head.  Until each trip lasted seconds and each was interrupted by realization of each trip being a trip and that my real self was outside of it.  The more it occurred, the more 'under layers' of the trips I felt, a trip-within-a-trip-within-a-trip, infinite nested trips, but short term memory constantly disappearing, sometimes in different houses I’ve lived in, maybe I was in a coma

Am I in hell being punished?  is this infinite, was each trip an entire lifetime, were the lifetimes real?  was I reliving my life each time just for the trip to realize it was fake and come out of it, only to relive it again at a lower level?  Why would I be in hell?  What deserved hell?  Did I do something bad?  What am I capable of, did I do that?  Am I being punished for something I did in my actual life, that I can no longer remember?  Where do these memories of my past come from, are they real or an implant to experience for the horror?

I was scared to interact with people in the physical world in case I made it aware I was tripping, or to pee, how many times have I already left my room?  where all the times trips, or did I actually go?

I felt like for each second passing I had an infinite number of trips, and in the real world seconds are padded with trips.  Maybe that's what 'time' is, you live but in each nanosecond that passes, you trip exponentially, something to occupy your mind in the idle times? but you forget each trip and so you can live a normal life unaware.  But now  am aware, did something with the system break?  did the weed break the padding so it all bleeds together?

I ended up losing most conscious ability, no wait this is real life, no this is...I pleaded quietly to myself if anyone in the physical word was near me, maybe someone putting me through this torture, could they finish, kill me, let it end
Maybe I’m alone and no one can help.  Someone would check on me eventually?  maybe in the physical world there’s no one but me.  

Maybe each trip is a parallel universe, or dimensions I’m spawning, maybe the dimensions /galaxies have life in them, maybe I’m spawning life, maybe I'm god, what if this was what god was? a conscious mind of pure creation creating life and destroying it as each trip is realized to be a trip.  Is that what God is?  wait that's what I'm doing, so yeah I am God.  It's horrible, the pillow, maybe if I keep feeling I can wake out of it, uncomfortable

This went on for hours, many times. The clock was now in a position I normally didn’t leave it in,  but I remember the time ranging between 12am and 4am, forwards and backwards.  I accidentally knocked something off my wardrobe and that was on the floor, so I knew that trip was real too. I left myself a note on my laptop, of ""worst trip of my life. infinite galaxies within each other. can’t stop"" so I know that I’d be conscious through all of that after all.  There's also lots of things I know weren’t real, days at school I hallucinated while thinking I’d just woken up at that point and all my life from then was a trip.  But Beavis and Butthead was paused where I left it, an appointment

Anyone who has fainted can probably attest to how bizarre it feels when you come to. I always to hear my surroundings before I can see

the first time it happened I remember feeling like I might have died, the sun was setting and the sky looked golden, just fucking beautiful, it was such a brief feeling but I felt so much positive energy it was amazing.

1332294200.0,r628u,The Mayan Journey: What I Learned About Myself Within A Species,SegaGenocide,4,2,1,"	I didn’t think it could be real – the concept of a journey. We all fantasized about that; about Odysseus and the lands he got to see. And even though he was separated from his love
	We set up basecamp at the falls. Our shirts stuck to our back like we were the first humans to feel heat. It would be a trek of firsts. The gorges in front of us radiated a teal blue I’ve never seen before and it wasn’t long before we found ourselves in the water. I know this is my perspective - my life, and it made us feel human. It made us feel like we were surviving. Not defending but learning to live through social contact and treating nature as an equal. Not many people know how to do that.
	We found a ledge on the top of the first waterfall that overlooked both the dive pools and the bare rock bustling with water. I pre-rolled a few joints for these serene moments so we were really feeling good. Eventually our trip would start and we would enter the ravine
	It’s difficult to present to you a perfect image of the beauty we saw those few hours – sometimes words feel awkward attempting to describe a view that catches breaths at sight. You’ll never have been me at that specific moment so it seems pointless to describe it to you. Nevertheless
	We could’ve been travelers stopping through in the 19th century from the whisper of rumors a few towns over, we could’ve been college students frustrated at time’s rigid structure and the way it prevents us from experiencing the emotions of every traveler ever to scale these waterfalls, condensed into a single frame and burst of time and life. I kind of hope they all would feel the way I did.
	I felt a personal connection with all those travelers and the people yet to laugh like a child in this natural water park. I’d like to think everyone would feel as happy as me – so in a way when I say “we”
	The stream was isolated by two steep hills of dark rock
At the beginning of our journey we didn’t even know the phenomenon awaiting us. We were content at the bottom of the stream, increasing in beauty at every literal bend to the point it almost seemed surreal. And while those waterfalls are all still pushing and manipulating water as if through some magical force, I like to think it only existed for that one day. Maybe I’m hoping it becomes a symbol for every miracle I see in life, for the selfless social contact that can bring us love at a base, simple, human level, for the idea of a heaven and it’s many waterfalls.
	Was I overwhelmed by beauty to the point it struck a chord inside me that resonated with the idea of a higher power until we were both shaking so out of controllably in control? Or was it the neurotransmitters in my brain creating synaptic connections on this drug I’ve never seen before? I’d like to think both ideas could co-exist. I’d like to believe truths aren’t restricted to the manner they were gained or the outcomes they push towards. 
	It’s interesting the barriers we put up when we define worth by how many objects we have. When everyone releases his or her muscles to hold the overwhelmingly dense truth of simplicity we can work together. It’s survival not on an individual level but a species level and it all starts with how small we are. How small, people, bugs, and the minor inconveniences we face as a result of another person’s misdoing or moment of uncertainty.
	We accepted this fairly early as we cut down anything that caused more deceit than bare truth. We tried to just go with the trip as we examined the lifestyle of fish brushing against our legs but some realizations required quiet reflection on a note pad – so we could enjoy these insights later. Our first entry was “time is a biological function of the expectancy of death.” The second entry consisted only of “underwater dinosaur land.”
	Once we appreciate simplicity, a commune is made without words or agreements.
	Maybe it’s where I lack but my level of comfort had not yet expanded enough to include a dozen people. I could have done maybe six at the time but since that was not an option
	We had to turn back eventually but I knew deep down in my heart if we kept going we would never hit a road. We lost the initial awe from nature so the walk back down strengthened previous ideas we struggled with earlier.
	It wasn’t about beauty anymore. I was so focused on trying to comprehend the meaning behind the beauty in random ion deposits in rocks; I didn’t know what to do when the rock broke in two. You had just finishing up sharing a revelation you had – they were often person when on our search to find our niche in the universe – and so I felt it necessary to share half the rock with you. I could’ve had two rocks to learn from, isn’t it? Their minds think like us but deep down we know no one else can feel like us.
	And while that may feel lonely, which somehow shows more wisdom through longevity than we do. Maybe we could learn from it.
The rock that helped me find myself was much smaller in two

1366184015.0,1cir0o,Helping a Friend Trip His Way Out of Alcoholism (With LSD-25) - Your Insight/Anecdotes Are Encouraged [X-Post to r/drugs &amp; r/LSD],dolandolanbillsyall,2,2,3,"I have read a few places that LSD has at a time been tested successfully to reduce alcoholism. After watching my friend attempt to drink himself to death I began to become inquisitive about this study and the possibility of such a thing helping. My friend drinks a few cans of steel reserve a day and hasn't had more than a few sober days in the past month. When I met him several years back he wasn't even drinking due to issues with his pancreas.

So I chat with him from time to time about stopping drinking or at least slowing it down, and he seems to be down. He just doesn't want to do it alone. He's definitely taken LSD in the past and used to be a meth addict, so the idea wouldn't be all that new to him.

I'm sure he would be uncomfortable if his drinking was the main discussion of our trip

While I'm usually a solitary tripper, but the sheer street cost of those substances compared to what you can find on The Road seems a bit disheartening. (I doubt A street level dealer is selling pure acid for 15 a hit.) Even given the fact that I may be new to the experience, I am not new to psychedelics and can certainly handle myself.

TL;DR: I have a friend who is an alcoholic and is only getting worse. He seems to be okay justifying his alcoholism

So given these facts I have a few underlying questions:

1) How much do you think would bean appropriate dosage for him given the circumstances. I probably can't get him to take more than 3 (300-450 ug)

2) Do you think this idea of getting him to reflect on his past is a bad thing?

3) How do you think the best way to broach the subject is during the peak?

4) Do you think this is even a good idea?

5) Should I go into it thinking it has the potential to even work? Or should I just go into it with a mindset of having fun and just see where it goes from there?

6) He probably wants to have a few beers that day

7) What about weed? I don't smoke anymore

That's $14 a gram if you do the math and that seems like a lot. Is SWIM wrong to think that this is a bit of a rip off? Are there other people you know of in this area or even in the US in general who find it much easier or is this typical?

Of course I think it has a lot to do with your ""connections"" and social circle, 5-MEO-DMT) I'd be so happy to find people who would make a fair trade, you know?
