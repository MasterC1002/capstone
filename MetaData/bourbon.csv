Dear Ambassador
 
Since we announced our decision last week to reduce the alcohol content (ABV) of Maker’s Mark in response to supply constraints

You spoke. We listened. And we’re sincerely sorry we let you down.

So effective immediately

The unanticipated dramatic growth rate of Maker’s Mark is a good problem to have

Your trust, so special.

We’ll set about getting back to bottling the handcrafted bourbon that our father/grandfather

As always

As of late it has become glaringly obvious that this subreddit is turning into an unproductive circle jerking cesspool.  The quality of content posted here has greatly declined, I'm using this to show the decline in mentality around here.  A quality review that I (and plenty of others) have taken time to write and create falls to the wayside while a picture of a bottle, a screenshot of Alton Brown, or one more regurgitated article about Maker's Mark is celebrated.  

I like this subreddit, copy the ones over at /r/scotch [but adapt them to this sub],) that will only allow quality original content **and enforce that users abide by these rules**.  Look at how many of default subreddits are filled with asinine comments, memes, and discussion about the same topics over and over.  That's what I feel like this sub is travelling on the path of, and I would hate for that to happen.  I believe that creating and enforcing such a set of rules would realign the user base towards submitting quality OC.

I understand I might be a bit harsh with this critique, /r/bourbon, I hope that some of you will feel the same way as me, and want this place to maintain its dignity and continue to grow; mods, I hope that you'll truly consider what I've said here, and whether you agree with me or not, at least consider some type of quality control.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/18ropc/message_to_the_community_help_save_rbourbon/

Some magazine called it ""whiskey of the year"" or something.

I drank almost the whole thing tonight with friends, I didn't review it, I didn't take pics, none of that.  Because when it all boils down, fuck it, whiskey is about drinking it with friends, new and old.

It was fantastic, and who I enjoyed it with may be better than an arbitrary score or review I give it.

Whiskey is for drinking, there will always be another bottle of something else.

I would like to make a few remarks about what I want from this community and what I encourage/discourage.

I highly encourage reviews. They are the lifeblood of whiskey discussion, please, upvote every review you encounter, including the post and the comment. And as a reviewer, don’t forget to archive! Remember, every first reviewer is entitled to flair AKA your favorite American whiskey, so please let me know in the comments if you have reviewed in the past and would like some flair.

I will be going through the archive over these few days and determining who is worthy of the flag. The way our review system works is, you will receive another piece, and so on until 50 reviews where you will receive a full American flag, a token that you are well acquainted with bourbon, rye and other American whiskey, which can be seen by all within the community. Remember: ALL American whiskey is welcome. However, you cannot receive these unless you archive! If you do not archive, please start archiving your reviews. If you don’t know how to review or archive

I highly discourage bottle porn on this sub. There is a separate subreddit entitled /r/whiskyporn where you can post all your bottle porn, some comments about the whiskey: where you bought it, why you bought it, how it tastes, and so forth can go a long way for promoting discussion in this subreddit.

If you expect anything from the future from me, as in any democracy, (cuz ‘MERICA) vote wisely.

Last but not least, please let me know in the comments and I will help you out. Till then, see you around.

/u/jbl7979 suggested the light-heavy and sweet-spicy as a beginning x and y axis for a bourbon flavor map.  I captured that along with some suggested examples in the attached diagram.

(/u/texacer suggested different axis: rye, and low / no rye bourbon - but I couldn't figure out which were opposites.  I also think there is a win to keeping the grain names out of things if light-heavy and sweet-spicy work.)

Soooo

1. Which other whiskeys should be on the map?  Looks like the scotch Malt Map has 77 listings.  That means about 8 bottles per square (for the little 9 box grid attached).

2. Where on the flavor map do they belong?

So on to to a solution. I went to a bar sometime ago that had ice that was not only perfect cubes, known as Kold Draft, mists water UP into a metal mold that is below freezing. Why does this work? Because this allows the ice to form more slowly and, thus, nearly eliminate the trapped air. So aside from this, how do we get perfect ice that doesn't melt immediately? How can we force it to freeze slowly? By putting water in an cooler and putting the cooler in the freezer! The insulated cooler prevents the ice from freezing to quickly. I recently tried this technique in a standard igloo playmate cooler (the 30 can variety). I poured about 2 gallons of water into the cooler, filling it about 4 inches, I removed it and started to chip at it only to find that it was half frozen. That's how significantly the cooler slows the process. The ice that was formed was perfectly clear. I chiseled some usable pieces that were about 1.5"" cubed, I'll take a knife

If anyone wants to find out more about it

TL;DR: Put water in a cooler

Edit: This has spurred quite the discussion.  I also came across the method that involves boiling water, always works. Yes, you end up with a giant block of ice, but that's ok with me. Someone mentioned just putting an ice cube tray in the cooler... I don't think that will work (if I remember my reading correctly), but if someone wants to try it and report back, go for it.  I like the massive chunk of ice. I don't know why, it's just fun to play with.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1ebifn/a_better_way_to_make_ice/

I guess you could say I'm learning to walk before I run

So, I've decided to try all the bottom shelf hooch, regardless of branding, review them here, and choose my favorite. 

**My criteria**

The reviewed must be all of the following:

* American whiskey. Absolutely no exceptions
* Available at a local liquor store in Alabama
* Must not be blended, or in any way altered with in accordance with the definition of American Whiskey.


**How the hooch will be reviewed**

I will ""judge"" the whiskey on its ability in 3 categories:

* Neat
* On the rocks
* In a sazerac or whiskey sour

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/g0UJBx5)

I bought this along with the Jeffersons Reserve and 10 year Rye for $100 as a package deal, distilled and bottled.

Batch No. 203 Bottle No. 0997

41.14% ABV

Appearance: Lighter than your average bourbon. I'd say its a solid amber.

Nose (neat): Vanilla forward

Taste (neat): First thing I get is apples. Pecan, but enough spice and heat. I wouldn't call it ""hot"" though.

Body: Unexpectedly oily.

Finish: smooth and peppery

Conclusions: Weak nose and lackluster finish hurt this one. It was more unimpressive than off though and I enjoyed it enough. This is a bourbon I will be able to fully enjoy without lamenting the fact that it will be gone if I keep drinking it! Lovely bottle my picture doesn't do justice to. Can't wait to try the Reserve and long for the day I can find a bottle of the Select.

Happy Presidents Day!

It is located in the sidebar and has over 1800 whisky reviews in it

If you write a review

This is for reddit submitted reviews only

**[""where is the submission form?""](http://i.imgur.com/vT7UX.png)**

The archive has been getting pretty vast over the last year and we would love all the bourbonit reviews to be included in it. 

It is also sortable in case you didn't know.  If you click on VIEW and change it to LIST mode

When you write your first review you can request text flair of the bottle you love the most.  I am considering similar level flair that /r/scotch uses

My sales rep for this area called me Friday night letting me know that PVW won't be coming in on the delivery trucks. The sales reps actually have to hand deliver every bottle of winkle they have. The reason why is that quantities are so small that any 1 bottle is unreplacable. So basically if a bottle was shorted off of the stores order ""Tough luck you won't get that bottle"".


So my salesman hand delivered every store in that town their PVW on friday night. Saturday afternoon 1 man drove to every store and bought every bottle at every store (everyone they would sell him). Who was this guy? He was another liquor store owner from another state. That tells us that this guy is able to pay state/local tax + full mark-up/gouging and then resale them and still make a profit..... Another salesman for the other sales route here said that there was a person following him to each and every store trying to buy every bottle of PVW as he was dropping it off. This is a part of why it is so hard to get.

I'm not 100% this is true. But my sales rep told me that Old Rip Van Winkle produced only 7

Still a lurker, but one night, I grabbed my fifth of Maker's Mark and tried to do my own internal review on a pad of paper.

* Color: Pretty much the color of... whisky.
* Nose: Smells like whisky.
* Palate: Tastes like... you know... bourbon.
* Finish: Umm... like I just drank bourbon.
* Overall: I *like* it!

I obviously had a ways to go. When I finally got the courage to log in and actively participate in the discussion, but with the preferences and tendencies of the poster in mind. The open and accepting atmosphere almost made me forget I was on reddit.

My biggest takeaway of /r/bourbon: **conversation &gt; karma**

Sure, maybe a few, but they stay pretty quiet. This community helps each other, encourages each other, and is always willing to share knowledge, experience, and opinions. That's a damn fine group of people if you ask me. So thank you all for making me feel welcome and removing any reservations I had about asking silly questions. Cheers!

Is it a good deal?  Read on!

**Kirkland Signature Bourbon 7 year.  $20 1L bottle** 51.5% abv (103 proof)

Enjoyed neat in a glenfarcias glass

**Color**: Amber-orange.  Quite attractive looking actually.  

**Nose**:  vanilla everywhere.  Like vanilla extract aged in charred oak barrels.  Dark fruit

**Taste**:  Sour and strong.  Intense burn.  Toasted bread and raw wood

**Finish**: pretty decent.  Caramel notes and oddly sweet given the harshness of the initial taste.  All moisture stripped from mouth but warm and pleasant

Not terribly complex but intense and satisfying at the price point.  If I was going to pick a paint-stripper bourbon I wouldn't choose this one but as a drinking bourbon at $20 for a liter this is legitimately not bad.  Certainly not a special occasion bourbon or something you break out for fine company

**Here's the long answer:**

According to the [Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, Subchapter A, Part 5, Subpart C, Section 5.22, Subsection B, Paragraph 1, ""'Bourbon whisky', or 'rye malt whisky' is whisky [sic] produced at not exceeding 160° proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn, or malted rye grain

Interestingly enough, by US law, only applies to Whiskies made for US Consumption, not exported Whiskies. 

However, and defines Bourbon as a product that ""has been manufactured in the United States in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States governing the manufacture of Bourbon Whiskey"" and Tennessee Whiskey as ""a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee."" So while Bourbon may be made anywhere in the USA, Tennessee Whiskey is defined as Bourbon made in Tennessee.

Canadian Liquor laws ([C.R.C.,_c._870/page-56.html#h-53)) do not separately define Bourbon from Whiskey, only that its a ""potable alcoholic distillate"" made from a ""mash of cereal grain or cereal grain products,"" though they still follow the NAFTA regulation, so don't worry, Canuks, you're still getting real

EU Liquor laws ([Regulation (EC) No 936/2009](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:264:0005:01:EN:HTML))  made explicit

Was actually disappointed with Blantons. That can be the trouble with a single barrell

Time to see if a Bourbon could match my favorite Scotches.

For the previous two days, the importance of Kentucky's climate in helping move the bourbon in and out of the barrel staves.  We got discussions about whether metal or wooden walls were better, whether the distance between ricks changed the airflow through the building - this was geeking out on a scale I had never imagined.  :D

...and then we went to Woodford.  They send most of their stuff to Louisville, this struck me as cheating; using a manufacturing process to circumvent all the careful consideration, the risk, and the attention to co-mingling that the traditional distilleries go through to produce quality product. At the same time, though, it seems like a smart way to try to ensure that a quality product goes into the bottles; Woodford has always struck me as one of the most polished bourbons, and I'm guessing this aging technique has something to do with it.

It's the only tour where I came away nonplussed.  My wife

This is also my first review. I've never cared to do a review before... Until I tasted this and had to share the experience. I obtained a sample through /r/ScotchSwap. That may prove to be a mistake as this is now

Prepared neat. 

**Color:** Darker and deeper than most bourbons I've had. Looks like good southern sweet tea.  

**Nose:** Initially some floral notes. No burn?!?!? At this proof? Second and third sniff. Honey and something else sweet... light fruity notes. Very nice. Best aroma therapy ever.

**Palate:** Everything bourbon should be. Beautiful sweetness. Honey and something else... figs? Slowly fading into caramel. The complexity is a masterwork. Yet its somehow... dare I say it? Smooth. A perfect balance of oak, tropical sun, baby laughter, a first kiss and nirvana. 

**Finish:** Long lasting warmth with various spices exploding over the tongue. A bit of good pipe tobacco smoke flavor. Totally relaxed body just taking it in... feeling like I need to lite up a smoke. The taste of tears start to make it to my mouth as I realize this was just a sample.

Van Winkles would be yearly/special editions as with all the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection.  They do qualify in the $50+ category.

Standard Offering is something that is not a special edition or yearly offering

High Rye bourbons for purposes of this would be anything over roughly 15% rye in the mashbill.  This includes: Woodford, Four Roses, Bulleit, Old Grand Dad, and Basil Hayden.  

Additional Finishing would be any 2nd barrel aging, Woodford Double Oak, Maker's 46, etc.

* and about 5 mL of 1988 Old Grand Dad dusty thewonkyprofessor sent me!

Those are basically all my open bottles.  The next step is to let this concoction mingle for about 2 weeks

As ralfy said

Now I understand a true solera involves the aging process and sharing portions from old barrels with new barrels

I can't wait to give it a go when I open/buy a new bottle in a few weeks.  I'll report back on my findings.  Anyone else have experience?  Maybe I shouldn't have mingled my ryes with bourbons?  maybe I should add my scotches and start seperate bottles for each style?

&gt;“Our [water] is drawn from deep under the distillery…so pure and perfect for whisky making we do nothing to it whatsoever… we use only the finest, well seasoned, and toasted to perfection, matures and softens the spirit.  This marriage of fine oak and whisky imparts a palate to the whisky bringing out vanilla, caramel honey… You are certain to find even more.  This Defiant young single malt already stands strong!  Time will make it even better.”

[Bottle Image](http://imgur.com/N1WyUke)


**Name:** Defiant American Single Malt Whisky

**Color:** Light copper

**Nose:** Alcohol

**Taste:** Alcohol

**Finish:** Alcohol burn

The last line on the company’s website really stands out to me now after I’ve tasted it; this is definitely a young whisky.  I didn’t see any age information on the website other than the “young” reference, and because I had to plunk down $55 for my first taste.  But even at only 82 proof, I found it hard to sip due because it tastes more like a “white dog” or “moonshine” type of whiskey.

I’ve actually enjoyed the legally available version of Popcorn Sutton’s Tennessee White Whiskey.  When I bought it for around $30 (1.75L) I knew it was an unaged spirit and I pretty much knew what to expect.  I’ve also had (but did not enjoy) the Buffalo Trace White Dog, and I paid more than I would have had I known.  So my review score is somewhat negatively biased because of the price, but shame on me for not researching more before buying it on a whim.  While I can say that the color is nice, the taste was the biggest turn off for me.  I did detect some complexity in the nose and on the palate, but I didn’t pick up on the caramel or vanilla.  Maybe I was just pissed.  This defiantly (see what I did there?) needs some decent aging.  I think it has potential and I’m certain it will improve over time.  I really want to like this, and I’ll give it another try in a few years, but defiantly (again!) in a bar next time.

**Score:** 60/100 (but still better than vodka IMO)

After doing a little internet research, but I still could not finish the entire glass.  It then sat in my basement for about a month before I decided to give it another go.  This time I decided to go all out and just pour about a shot of it straight into my glass, and drink it as is.  Although I took the wrong approach of trying to finish it in one gulp, I actually found that I liked it much more than I remembered.  I poured another glass, a little bit more this time, and sipped it while watching tv.  It was starting to grow on me.  A few days later I poured another glass and I was hooked.  I did a little more research online and discovered that drinking it from the bottle to the glass to my mouth was called drinking it neat.  The further I got through the bottle the more I realized that this is what drinking bourbon was about; the aroma, the different flavors

As the bottle was approaching its end, the BT seemed to go down easier for me and the bottle only lasted me about 2 weeks (I only drink about 3-4 nights a week).  The BT made me realize that there was more out there to bourbon and that they all were not the same.  To me the BT was rich, smooth and complex while still being very sweet.  Towards the end of this bottle was when I discovered /r/bourbon and started lurking and learning what I could.  That brings me to this week. 

When I finished the BT I decided to pick up something to expand my knowledge of the flavors of bourbon.  I grabbed a bottle of Bulleit Bourbon.  Immediately after drinking it I started to understand what I liked about bourbon.  The Bulleit to me had much of the same flavor as BT, and the BB has a good amount of flavor to it, but has a spice that my tongue loves.  Of the three, the Bulleit is probably my favorite, with the Buffalo Trace a close second.  I like Maker's Mark, but in comparison I do not enjoy it as much as the other two I have tried.

So finally, what other bourbons should I try to learn more about what I like and don't like.  Secondly, how do I go about learning what different flavors are in a whisk(e)y?  I can pick out the woody barrel flavor, the sweetness, and the spice as separate flavors, but how do I go about learning to taste cinnamon, clove, tobacco

TL;DR I have garnered an affection for bourbon over the past 3 or 4 months in the progression of Maker's Mark -&gt; Buffalo Trace -&gt; Bulleit Bourbon.  I enjoy drinking it neat

I got some very conflicting timetables from various sources. Ultimately

I did only single ingredient infusions because I wanted to understand how particular fruits, the raspberry, blackberry and vanilla turned out to be winners; the habanero, dried longan and ginger were losers. The habanero and ginger were just too overpowering, probably because I left them in there for 19 days. The dried longan was weird. The tamarind, persimmon and, surprisingly, were themselves a bit overwhelmed by the WT101. I'll do some actual ingredient mixing next time.

1367345295.0,1dfbg6,OK. Non-Review OC: The effects of Wood on Bourbon,hebephrenic,25,3,29,"**Using all of the info provided thus far

When bourbon is aged in its required charred oak barrels, and evaporation occurs. All three are important, which is why just putting the stuff in a small barrel (as many start-ups do) or mixing it with wood chips does not result in good whiskey as oak flavors are extracted, but little else occurs. (Thanks to my fellow reddit users, especially the flavor chemist, “Flavorless” for expanding this. I have also heavily relied on the text and references from the excellent blog whisky science)  

**Charred Oak Extracts**  
All bourbon and straight rye whiskies are aged in new, they form a lot of the aromas that we associated with caramel, bread, burnt sugar, beer, coffee etc. This burning process has made a lot of new chemical species that are released through smoke, but after the charring is done some compounds remain in the charred wood.   

Some of the compounds related to flavor are as follows:  
Hemicellulose is broken down by heat of charring and time to furfural (nutty aromas), caramel aromas), maltol (malty aromas) and cyclotene (maple, caramel, licorice).  
Lignins are polymers (long and chain-like molecules) that in the case of oak lignins, spice or floral notes. Most notably, though, are the vanillins, which lend the characteristic vanilla flavor to bourbon.  
Lactones occur in a number of conformations and impart coconut-vanilla aromas or a more incense-like aroma; I love the latter when I come across it.  

In addition to imparting beneficial flavors to the spirit, while others are extracted into it.  

**Native Wood Extracts/Reactions**  

Beneath the Char layer of the barrel, this contributes flavors and aromas that one would expect from dry wood, specifically oak. Oak from different areas and of different species may contribute different flavors.  In wine this is why American oak (much more vanilla) is very different than French oak (spicy as well as dill-like flavors). For the whiskey to extract compounds from the native wood, the liquor needs to first pass through the char layer. It is a slow process for the spirit to diffuse through the char layer, and again a slow one for it to extract native wood flavor compounds.     
Most of these compounds are actually bound to polymers (such as the lignins above) that do not readily extract into the spirit, which must then diffuse back through the char layer (which may filer out other compounds, see below).  
As the spirit slumbers away in the wood, including the humidity and temperature of the warehouse as well as the temperature shifts that occur; the more dramatic the temperature changes are, the greater the transit of the spirit in and out of the wood will be. The tightness of the oak grain and the species of oak can also affect this (though American whiskey uses alsmost exclusively the Quercus alba species).  

**Other Reactions**  

In addition to extraction of the charred oak flavors there are other

The important thing about all of these factors is that they take time. The extracted flavors (lactones, so it is not unreasonable to expect years or even decades worth of continued flavor evolution from a barrel of spirit, accounting for the increasing complexity of extra-aged whiskies.  

**Evaporation**  

In addition to imparting wood flavors, dry environments (high warehouse floors), more water is lost, leading to higher proof spirits (like Stagg); lower floors and higher humidity lead to more alcohol loss (e.g. barrel-strength Four Roses at near 100 proof). Either way, the flavors are concentrated. This typically leads to a more intense spirit, and also one that is significantly more expensive (by our math an 18 year-old barrel will have lost 60% of its original volume)!  

So, the truly special whiskeys make it through many years of concentration and chemical reactions that lead to much more complex complements if volatile chemicals and thus more complex aromas and flavors. That said, it is actually an art to produce such whiskies, as there is a reasonably high risk that too much time in a barrel can lead to whisky that is just too ""woody.""

1325743865.0,o3msh,How I taste/review whisk(e)y,RustyPipes,25,3,24,"This is by no means an instructional

Prep:  I will purposely keep a clean palate all day, smokes, green peppers, or anything else that deadens or clings to my palate.  I will generally review about an hour after eating, to not be super full, but not hungry.  I find a room with no other smells going on, no candles, no smelly cat smells.

Glasswear: I always and only use a [Glencairn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Glencairn_Whisky_Glass.jpg/170px-Glencairn_Whisky_Glass.jpg) or [Copita](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Copita-of-amontillado.jpg).  The concentrated nose is perfect for tasting spirits and I cannot stress enough how much of a difference these glasses make.

How I taste: Neat, so, will only review it neat.  I have been known to put 1 small ice cube in a dram of Booker's from time to time, but it's rare.  I do not by any means think this is the ""proper"" or ""correct"" way to drink whiskey, it's just how I like to do it.  Some would like it watered down a bit, especially cask strength offerings.

Reviewing: I cover the color, and finish.  

* Color: This is the most fun

* Nose: I smell with my mouth closed from the rim of the glass and from 2"" away.  I do the same with my mouth open from the rim

* Taste: I sip a little, and swallow.  Next one is a bigger sip, then suck all the air of out of my mouth and press my tongue up against the roof of my mouth for a few seconds.  Then just finish my dram normally, a sip at a time.  Taking notes the whole time.

* Finish: I record along the way

I revisit all categories as I drink

I am not afraid to say what I taste, it was there dammit.

Ratings: For scotch I break it down into:

* Taste: 75 points
* Value: 15 points
* Uniqueness: 5 points
* Would I Buy Again?: 5 points

Bourbon:

* Taste: 80 points
* Value: 15 points
* Would I Buy Again?: 5 points

I threw ""uniqueness"" out of my bourbon ratings

Words and flavors:  Bourbon is pretty tied to grain build, Vanilla, Caramel, Toffee, Rye, Wood, and Char. It's just different levels of that, fruit

I read other reviews and tasting notes the company has as I drink.  Seeing if I can pick out the same flavors.  Binnys.com will often list a quick review with notes.  Also, drink something like Macallan Cask Strength and it will help you find sherry in other scotch.  Try breaking down other things, like, Dr. Pepper.  23 flavors? Try to find them.  Same with gin, there are 12 in Beefeater, how many can you taste?

**Eagle Rare 101

**Color**:  Cherry oak

**Nose**: Instant ""old.""  I don't know how else to describe it.  There's a strong floral vanilla note.  Musty dust and old wood bookcase.  Creamy sweetness pokes through towards the end with toffee, wet cork?  Wow.

I usually get strong browned apple and apple cider from anything with a hint of rye, but it's non-existent in this dram.  Honestly, this is a new experience for me in whiskey.  It brings me back to my great-grandmothers camp in New Hampshire, and especially my great-grandfather's study with the dark wood and musty bookshelves.

1343787008.0,xhey0,Incredible Luck for a Maker's Mark Ambassador,7son75,27,4,11,"Sometime in the last decade, had a son

Earlier this year, I was hooked again. My passion for bourbon quickly turned into an obsession. I read as many reviews as I could find, sampled as many releases as I could get my hands on, and read the history of just about every Kentucky distillery that ever existed.

At some point, there was a barrel with my name on it. Without knowing what year I joined, I had no idea if I'd missed my chance at my batch. My wife and I had already been planning a September trip to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. I *had* to know what was going on with my barrel before making the trek down.

I figured it was a stretch, serendipity was on my side.

So, my trip just got a *whole* lot more special!
