Confucius says: If you sit by the river long enough

**ORLY? WTF?**

This ""quote"" appears on [various articles](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1225153), but it's originally a really a badass misinterpretation by some Chinese illiterate fucktards.

Confucius originally [said](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Analects#Part_9)


    子        在 川    上   曰，  逝者        如    斯夫，不舍      昼   夜
    Confucius on river side says: the past    like  this  no matter day night
                                  the time             
                                  the previous
                                  the passing things
    
So basically Confucius said: 

    The time is passing like a river running day and light

The fucked up part is the interpretation of 逝者, or the past *time*. Confucius never meant to say *enemy corpse* by any context.

This is a perfect example of how translation can go horribly wrong.

I have several. Here are my favorites:
Summer of 2010, to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Only foreigner in the whole carriage, of course. I exchange a few pleasantries in broken Russian with the older Kyrgyz ladies who sit across me, but being curious, they pepper me with questions that I just don't understand. There is a Russian girl my age sitting next to me, I figure if *one* person here knows English, in Russian:

- Do you speak English?
- Niet! I only speak Russian and Chinese. (at no point then did I mention anything about living in China... turns out she lived in 西安 for 10 months)
- *thinking* You better not be kidding me..........

So she became the unofficial translator, inspect the passports, come at a stand still upon seeing mine in the pile, then start asking me shit in Russian. Add a bottle of vodka and a few beers to my 听不懂 stupor, and the soldier gets more and more impatient. Then, the Russian chick says something like ""I can translate"" and the soldier, relieved, I speak Chinese."" He let out an audible gasp and said ""CTO?!"" (what?!). We managed to get through the border procedures smoothly. 

Then, and the cashier asks where I'm from because of my sexy-ass accent in English. I was wearing a football jersey from 河南建业, so I pointed at it and jokingly said ""China"". He said ""Yeeeeah right"" and then some old black man (must have been in his forties or even fifties) comes up and starts chatting me up in pretty decent Chinese. We kept going for a few minutes, attracting a big crowd of Mexicans in the process who were not quite grasping what the fuck was going on.

And well... I talked with some actual Chinese people abroad as well

**First of all

* A polite opener to get a stranger's attention. So asking a random person on the street for directions (or for any other request). Or calling for a fuwuyuan (你好，买单! [maidan]). It can basically take the place of that person's name when you're unsure about using 大妈 or 大姐 or 服务员 or 小妹 or 老板娘 [laoban niang]. 你好 is very safe

* As a formal opener in written communication.

&gt; Hello Mr. Smith

* As a greeting when meeting someone for the first time


For more details

**早.**I use this a lot with people I know well. Friends

**饭吃了吗？**To me, you can ask this in various ways like 你饭吃了吗？饭吃了没？饭有没有吃？ etc. Usually a direct answer is expected (as opposed to the English ""What's up"", which can be replied with a ""Hey"" or ""Hey what's up?"" instead of a ""Nothing much""). A simple 还没 or 嗯 [en]，刚[gang] 吃完 is sufficient. But, like I said, I almost never encounter this in my daily life, besides with older generation folk. Your mileage may vary.

**在干嘛？[ganma]** What are you up to? Really casual, if you're calling someone, you can first ask 干嘛呢？喂[wei] 你在干嘛？Or if you see someone on the computer, you can walk up to them and ask the same thing. But if you meet your friend for the movies at 3pm, you can't then walk up to them in front of the cinema and say 在干嘛？(even though ""Hey what's up?"" would make sense in that context).



But ultimately I think the most versatile and direct greeting you can have is your **嗨 [hai]. Which is Hi.** But this will also be generationally dependent. Don't expect to say 嗨 to people 45+ years old.

There is definitely a lot more development that needs to be done here. Here are the current limitations:

* 1) Can only lookup one character at a time.

* 2) Only breaks down the character into two parts.

* 3) Some characters break down into REALLY weird glyphs

* 4) Some character decompositions show numbers instead of their components. This is how the data is structured. It will be solved soon. This is especially apparent in more complex characters and 繁体字 (traditional characters).

* 5) The decompositions aren’t all radicals. They are “parts” rather than radicals. Well most of it. I will set out to show all the radicals eventually.

* 6) When decomposing a radical it displays an “undefined” next to it. Will remove it in the next update.

Original Thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/zwup5/character_sets_with_sound_information_whats_your/

It's been in my mind for a long time. I wanted to know this myself! I recently coded a feature into [HanziCraft](http://hanzicraft.com) which automatically tries to find pronunciation clues in the character.

Using this tool
1) where the pronunciation of the component is exactly the same as the character
2) where the syllable of the component is the same

I put the two lists online [here](http://hanzicraft.com/lists/phonetic-sets).

I limited each set to three or more characters

I mention on the page there's another variable to consider, how many characters with the component provide 'good' clues to pronunciation versus how many characters with the component provide 'bad' clues.

梦见

走在无人的旷野，

视线朦胧，

手上的光亮即将隐去。


我在寂寞的世界

不停地赶路，

不断地告诉自己，

就快到了，

就快到了。


路不断展向前方，

狂风在我耳边呼啸……


呼的一声，

我突然凌空飞起。

**January 3. Weather: clear skies**

I dreamt of

a walk through the barren wilderness

my line of sight bleary

a handheld light moments from stowing itself away.

In this lonely world

Incessantly racing ahead

Continually telling myself

I'll be there soon

I'll be there soon.

The road continues onward

Fierce winds howling beside me...

With a single whistle of air

I suddenly fly off into the skies above.

----------

(1) 梦见 is literally ""dream + to see"" and means ""to dream about"" or ""to see in a dream."" Synonym: 梦到

Here is a nice use of the word in a discussion of Zhuangzi's dream of being a butterfly:

Original (ancient Chinese): 昔者庄周梦为胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也。不知周也。俄然觉，则蘧蘧然周也。不知周之梦为胡蝶与？胡蝶之梦为周与？此之谓物化。

Meaning (modern Chinese): 其大意就是庄子一天做梦，**梦见**自己变成了一只蝴蝶，梦醒之后他发现自己还是庄子，于是他不知道自己到底是梦到庄子的蝴蝶呢，还是梦到蝴蝶的庄子。在这里，庄子提出一个哲学问题——人如何认识真实。如果梦足够真实，人没有任何能力知道自己是在做梦。

(2) I translated 无人 as ""barren

(3) 手上的光亮 was a bit tough to translate

(4) Note the use of 地 (""the third de"") in sentences such as ""不停地+verb"" and ""不断地+verb"". Even native Chinese speakers will often not pay attention to this grammatical formality, 地 is correct.

(5) The author uses 不断 twice; I translated the first as ""continually"" and the second contributed to the verb ""continues.""

(6) 呼啸 is tough to translate as well; the dictionary entry is ""whistle, by the way, the 口 on the side of each character should have let you know that it is related to sound. Note that the literal translation is that this sound was ""next to his ears""; I translated it to ""beside me.""

(7) Note also that 呼 is used in the following line again

Well

I have been living in China for 5 or 6 months and though I have not been studying my ass off I have certainly made some ground work IMHO. I have a fairly limited vocabulary of around 600 words

Since I got here I made the effort to speak to people every single day for at least a couple of hours which at the beginning was exceptionally painful and pretty much useless. My name resource is Chinese pod along with Pleco that I use as a general dictionary and flash card application. Whenever I have a spare minute I always flick through my flash cards.

Before I started studying I can remember reading and old post on here which almost prevented me from even trying - something along that lines that it would take years and years of serious study before it was even possible to have the most basic of conversations.

Granted

Anyway

The Mandarin word for ""object"" or ""thing"" is 東西/东西 (traditional/simplified). As you might know
But why is it East/West? Why not North/South? Why not *compass orientation 1/compass 
orientation 2? This is because of the meanings that are attached to the words 東
北 (add 中 for the full compass

In Chinese medicine (don't disregard it
directions are each attuned to their own element (and organ and season). For some reason or another

南 = 心/火 (South becomes ""north"" if your body was a compass. Located at the heart. Fire rises to the top.) 北 = 腎/水 (North is uh...south now apparently. It's your kidneys. Waterflows to the bottom). 東 = 肝/木 (East, lungs, gold/metal). Also, 中 = 脾/土 (Center, spleen, soil/earth.)

So, except you're too short to punch a giraffe in the neck and the giraffe would probably kill you for it. So don't do that. 

As you probably noticed, chemicals. Selling of oil leads to wars (in ancient as well as modern times). These are bad. &gt;:[

On the other hand, in short. This is also good. Hehe...gold...

Now we come to the word for ""make"" (it actually has many meanings, ""to be""...) that you might be familiar with, ""做"". The words 東西 are typically used after 做 as in ""making something"" or ""what are you making"" (你在做什麼東西*啊?). 

But now that you know the extended meaning (can't find a better phrase) of each of 東, it's clearer as to why it's 東西 rather than 南北. You want to make the good things rather than make the bad things. I'm sure I'm missing something in the explanation, but I can't figure out what I'm missing. 

*啊 is just a sound. It can sometimes clarify what emotion you're expressing. It feels more natural too..

Something else too. My mum wrote this chart thing up for me. It has the organs

I have an app on my phone called Worldictionary. It is able to recognise Chinese characters in an image (e.g. a photo of Chinese characters from your textbook) and convert them into text format so you can paste them into Google Translate and get their pinyin.

So the full steps are as follows:

1. You have a page of Chinese characters in a book.
2. You open Worldictionary on your iPhone or Android phone and use it to take a picture of the text. It will automatically recognise all the characters.
3. Use Worldictionary to e-mail the characters to you.
4. You will receive an e-mail with all the characters in it.
5. Paste them into Google Translate and you now have the pinyin (as well as Google's attempt at translating them).

This is saving me loads of time trying to translate blocks of text. I hope it can help some of you too!

This post will go into some individual phrases that you may use in such meetings. You'll only be able to use them once for each meeting

**贵姓  (gui xing)**: Last name/family name. This is a formal way to ask someone's name. 贵 in this context means honored or honorable. They will ask 贵姓？ or 请问贵姓？ or 请问您贵姓? If they are not your equal, meaning that you are not some haughty aristocrat of noble birth, and there is no need for the 贵. (免 here means to be removed as unnecessary, as seen in 免税 (tax free)). The 免贵 phrase is mandatory if you are speaking as equals (business partners) or you are speaking to a superior (a boss, a boss's potential business partner, a client you are trying to court, etc.).  贵姓 is a really really standard phrase so I advise everyone to learn it.

**久仰 (jiu yang)**: This is the Chinese version of ""Your name/reputation precedes you."" Typically it's said 久仰久仰 or 久仰大名. It's said semi facetiously. (You wouldn't typically say ""Your reputation precedes you."" with a 100% serious face unless you were a Bond villain.) You should say it with a laugh to show that you are not 100% serious

**再会 (zai hui)**: This might be a regional thing, people say 再会 a lot in their local dialect as a direct replacement of 再见, but in business settings 再会 is still said in standard mandarin as a more formal version of goodbye. I'm not sure if they use this in the north though.

**工作愉快 or 合作愉快 (gongzuo yukuai

**成交 (cheng jiao)**: Means ""Deal!"" But it's quite casual,000 RMB deal. I suppose the same is in English, in that you don't really say ""Deal!"" after agreeing to sign a contract.

**Transcript:**   

孩子呢天生是顽皮好动的，尤其是有些小男孩儿都是皮得不得了，上天入地，无所不能啊。最近在山东莱芜一个两岁的小男孩儿玩儿着玩儿着，突然大哭了起来。怎么回事呢？他的小弟弟被卡住了。   

卡住小男孩儿生殖器的就是这一列红色玩具小火车。虽然只有大人的手掌这么大，但镜下可把小家伙疼得够呛。   

孩子哭，家长急，[...]小家伙的命根子被火车轮胎里转轮紧紧得卡在了里面。消防队也发现用手指根本解决不了这道难题。  

这么敏感的部位可不敢使太大劲儿，小家伙疼得直冒冷汗，大人们也都急得使大汗淋漓。为了避免破胎过程中的震动伤了孩子的命根，消防队员一边固定住小火车，一边细心地调整角度和力度。经过十分钟的努力，小火车一侧的轮胎轴承慢慢松动了。最后，转轮终于被拆了下来。  

（谢谢了，谢谢）  

咳，小家伙得救了，竟然一声也不哭了。一般检查后没啥问题。谢谢消防叔叔咯！  

这么小的火车玩具平时小孩们塞一点儿东西也塞不进去，你说这小家伙到底怎么弄的呢，这个孩子真有本事的。不过没事，长大了就好了，就不会玩儿火车了。再次提醒一下，当家长的一定要看好自己的小家伙们

------

**[《又寂寞又美好》](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Solitude)** is a collection of poems by 几米. The poems are good for Chinese learners

A fair amount of the book is available [here](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_2.html), and additional translation notes.

**In other words:** I am proposing a collective endeavor by users of this subreddit to turn this book of poems into pedagogical materials for Chinese learners.

---------

**Notes:** 

For the purpose of standardization, and the sections.

**Note 1:** to produce the line break just type in a bunch of hyphens.

**Note 2:** to get the pinyin quickly

**Note 3:** the goal of the translation notes is to provide some insight into the conversion from Chinese to English (which is rarely word-for-word/逐字的) and also to give some pointers to learners at all levels. You can see in the first post that the notes address a range of levels, recognizing 口字旁) to classical Chinese (e.g., the selection by 庄子). Hopefully this comes off as ""something for everyone"" rather than haphazard; so look over what you can understand, and come back later to whatever is confusing.

**Note 4:** At least one of the poems in the online version is missing the date/weather. If you want to translate a dateless poem

**大龄文艺女青年之歌**


王小姐三十二岁了

朋友们见到了她

都要问一个问题

你什么时候打算嫁呀？


可是嫁人这一个问题

又不是她一个人可以决定的

她问她爸爸

她问她妈妈

他们都说你赶紧的


你看，你看

你看人家那那那那那

你看，你看

你看看看那那那那


大龄文艺女青年

该嫁一个什么样的人呢？

是不是也该找个搞艺术的

这样就比较合适呢？


可是搞艺术的男青年

有一部分只爱他的艺术

还有极少部分搞艺术的男青年

搞艺术是为了搞姑娘


搞姑娘又不只搞她一个

嫁给他干什么呢？

搞姑娘又不只搞她一个

奶奶奶奶奶奶的


朋友们介绍了好几个

有车子房子和孩子的

他们说你该找个有钱的

让他赞助你搞创作


可是大款都不喜欢她

他们只想娶会做饭的

不会做饭的女青年

只能去当第三者

不会做饭的文艺女青年

只能被他们潜规则

奶奶奶奶奶奶的


这一首歌纯属雷同

如有虚构实属巧合

请不要自觉对号入座

然后发动群众封杀我


你看，你看

你看她只会做西红柿炒鸡蛋

你看，你看

还要就着方便面


那是非常好吃的

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia

那是非常的好吃的

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia


哦，哦，这是一首悲伤的歌

哦，这是一首——

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia

Right now
Online courses would be divided up into lessons / chapters matching a textbook and workbook (that we will publish this summer), like what you see at memrise and other flashcard sites. These would be used to accompany explanations from the textbook, from the videos and from in class, and would allow us to have a sort of ""flipped classroom"" model. For online-only learners we would have weekly skype / video chat sessions to help students with specific issues they are having. 

We also want to develop some general tools

An animated character lookup

A database of sample sentences for characters and phrases (à la NciKu)

Recordings of our teachers pronouncing characters

A font / writing style converter for simplified / traditional as well as to see how characters render in different writing styles.


Is there anything you all would add? Do you have any experience taking classes with this format? What kind of tools on other sites do you find useful

A sentence comes out without tense or gender, you could say that Chinese is quite primitive, but it can contain a lot of imagination in that when you’re reading it, you’re not so confined by the writing. In fact, when you are reading, you must participate in adding many things, a process that takes place subconsciously. It is a bit like viewing art.

* 乒乓	pīngpāng	ping-pong
* 忐忑	tǎntè	perturbed / fidgety
* 旮旯	gālá	nook / out-of-the-way place
* 曱甴  gaat6zaat6  cockroach (Cantonese)

* 凹凸	āotū	bumpy / uneven
* 本末	běnmò	'root and branches' (beginning to end
* 上下  shàngxià	up and down

Extra note: Another interesting category of words are two-syllable one-morpheme words who share the same radical but which have phonetic parts to indicate the pronunciation. One of my teachers said that many of these words were originally loanwords.

* 疙瘩	gēda	lump
* 蜘蛛	zhīzhū	spider
* 蜻蜓	qīngtíng	dragonfly
* 蟑螂	zhāngláng	cockroach

Can anybody think of any other words that are like these? Any other thoughts about these words?

Edit: I found a couple more similar words:

(1) ""Dimly lit"" probably doesn't do 光线昏暗 justice; note that 光线 has a literal translation closer to ""beam of light."" Also

(2) I added a ""so"" to line three. More literally

(3) 若 is a fancy way to say ""if""; even fancier is 倘若. Other ways to say ""if"" include starting a sentence with 如果, for example, ""要是……的话，……""

(4) 花猫 has many names. For the Chinese wikipage

(5) I translated 野鸟 as ""bird

(6) 乌 means dark/black, which means ""to envelope"" or ""to cover."" For example: 乌云笼罩着森林 = Dark clouds enveloped the forest.

(8) 缓慢悠静的时空 was the toughest part to translate. 缓慢 means slow,"" so I (again somewhat roughly) translated to ""time and place.""

[**六月二十四日 天气阴沉**](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_47.html)

魔术师们的高帽子，

在荒野召开大会，

他们决定一起施展魔法，

让世上所有寂寞的人，

全都快乐的在一起。

一阵狂风吹来，

打乱了他们的节奏，

帽子如落叶般随风四处飘散，

只留下寂寞的人在风中大声叹息。

Happy together.

But a great gale arrived

Throwing off their rhythm

As hats were blown all over like fallen leaves

And the lonely people were left sighing in the wind.

------

(1) 高帽子 in this context means ""top hat

(2) 施展 means ""to use fully or completely"". Since we are talking about magicians getting together to alleviate loneliness

(3) 节奏 means rhythm, beat. I think it is meant to invoke some musical or dance-like quality of the hats moving about in the wind.

(4) 如(落叶)般 means ""like dead/fallen leaves."" There is a grammar pattern ""如……般"" being used here. As another example

(5) 四处 literally means ""four places/locations/spots

I'm a native English speaker from the middle of the U.S. (Kansas) with only a little Spanish and German as foreign languages. I'm 25 and work about 60 hours per week as a chemical engineer. I don't know any native Mandarin speakers, specifically Mandarin, has been on my bucket list for a while and I was recently inspired by Benny Lewis' AMA on Reddit to get serious about Mandarin. After a few weeks of prodding around the internet, gathering resources, and reading about different approaches to learning Mandarin, I think I've decided how I want to tackle it.  
  
My problem is going to be time. I've committed myself to spending 30 min to an hour every day working on Mandarin. I have an hour commute to and from work that I typically listen to podcasts or audiobooks and I plan to (eventually) fill the drive with material from Chinesepod.com and similar sites but more on that later.  
  
**My first 1-3 months:** I'm going to work through the first unit of Rosetta Stone for Mandarin. I know Rosetta Stone isn't a fan favorite among some polygots, less on characters (for now) and grammar. I've also considered getting the Michel Thomas program to listen to on my commute for this period. 
  
**3 months to 1 year:** This is where I shift to heavy immersion and vocab. Change all the languages on my computers, but I've gotten mixed reviews on this resource as well. I'll start watching Chinese TV shows (children at first) and trying to read daily chinese-language newspaper websites. I also will try to find native speakers and/or try to communicate in chat rooms.  
  
**1 year onward:** Continue expanding my character set. Within three years I'd like to have ~2

To illustrate what I'm talking about,  she was a communications major, which meant all her coursework and classes were in English. When we first started hanging out, it was on the idealistic basis that ""we can be language partners and help each study!"" but it almost never worked out that way. She'd always feel like the amount of time we were spending on English was lacking, and I felt the same way about the time we were spending on Chinese. Ultimately, the partnership was a really tense, with both of us always feeling like we were being slighted.  At the end of the semester, and we were meeting less and less (probably just for one meal a week).

Here's another example of a situation I'm sure many on this board know well: You go somewhere, but you just get another reply in English. It's frustrating, because both parties seem to want to practice their languages skills. On one hand, you've paid the price and made the sacrifice to live in a foreign place to learn the language; from another angle, the other person might just be trying to be accommodating.  

I hate these kinds of situations, which I'll share with the group in a bit if an actual discussion gets going.

In a certain sense

I reckon these ""sound sets"" are one of the easiest ways/hacks to memorize characters in bulk. 

I call ""1st Order Sound Set"" a group of characters that have the exact same pronunciation (both pinyin and tone), is *also* a character in it's own right and is itself within that set. (It doesn't matter if this 声旁 is found in other characters with other pronunciations).    

I call a ""2nd Order Sound Set"" a set of characters that have the same pinyin and tone pronunciation


I would love it, or suggest your favourite sound sets (the ones with a lot of characters) so that we can practise them. 

And I'm curious - **does anyone know which is the biggest?**    



---------------------------------    

**Some sets following the ""First Order Sound Set"" rule**:    

ba1 - 巴 - 巴疤芭笆粑鲃吧

bi4 - 辟 - 辟避壁臂璧薜嬖

ma3 - 马 - 马蚂玛码吗骂 ""The Horse"" set

man4 - 曼 - 曼慢漫幔缦熳 ""The Bankok"" set

nong2 - 农 - 农浓侬脓哝

ping2 - 平 - 平评萍坪鲆枰 ""The Flat Peace"" set

qian1 - 千 - 千迁阡仟芊扦钎

yu2 - 俞 - 愉逾瑜榆渝

zheng1 - 争 - 争睁铮挣筝

zheng1 - 正 - 正征怔症

**Some sets following the ""2nd Order Sound Set"" rules**:

pao2 - 袍咆庖匏狍龅 (however


yi4 - 艺忆亿屹 (however

jiao3 - 佼狡皎饺绞铰 (however


-----------------------------------    

(Side note: I find them extremely easy to memorize in this manner: e.g, a woman, grass, moon etc, saying what they mean in his accent).    

I wonder what could be other types of sound set? (**Edit**: qeny shows a list of characters that have the same ""final"" sounds/pinyin (but different tones) and same  声旁 component. E.g. 尧 for ""-ao

Another factor which feels important is the level of the audio we're absorbing. I think everyone agrees that listening to very simply Chinese isn't very helpful if we want to improve listening ability in general (but might be helpful for other reasons). I personally don't find it very useful to listen to something I don't understand at all

I just wrote an article about a phenomenon I think is quite common. You can read the article here ([Triggering quantum leaps in listening ability](http://www.hackingchinese.com/?p=400)), I have started listening to much harder material a few times in my studies and each time I've found out that if I just give it enough time and stay focused, listening ability tends to catch up. My feeling is that the initial fear of not understanding everything or close to everything has been holding me back.

After talking to quite a number of other learners and reading about other people's experiences

Been experimenting with watching Chinese TV shows on the internet to try to improve my listening skill and general vocabulary.

I'm not sure the best way to go about it

Usually if I just watch the TV show I find that the dialogue is too quick or complicated to understand

I have tried covering up the subtitles and just focusing on listening and trying to get as much out of it as I can. Which is difficult and I'm not sure if I am really learning very much.

I have also tried watching it through while pausing frequently to look up unfamiliar characters from the subtitles in a dictionary. This seems to help and I feel like I learn new words this way

Has anyone found a better way to do this?

Maybe I should quit trying to watch Chinese TV until my overall language skill is better?

He became fluent in spoken Chinese and had around 4000 characters memorized after 14 months.  His situation is a little different, but some people do have time to study the way Glossika did.

I agree with people here that say you must devote serious time to the study of Chinese to make progress.  I also think that if you are driven enough and have the time you can make an amazing amount of progress in a year.  So

Iv been learning Hanzi for about 4 months (with a break

Now I want to try this same system with Hanzi

Could you also elaborate on the long term effects of your method. I want to drill Hanzi because I like that method

But! In the back of my head I have this sensation that I might also easily forget the words I drill. So just talk about your experiences about learning vast amounts of characters. Note: I keep practicing my known words constantly so its not like I stop looking at them once I know them. This is important because perhaps it doesn't matter HOW you first learned the word

On one hand I wanna just get the characters out of the way in a brute force manner

Its amazing how fast you can forget stuff. Imagine forgetting 750 characters you worked your butt of everday for 3 months to know.

好像冬天冰封了你的一个笑颜，
让你低声倾诉着，不能对她说的秘密。

(also posted in /r/ linguistics and /r/ Chengyu)

I'm doing a project for my (teaching) ESL grad school class about idiom congruency in Chinese and English.

Essentially I'm going to test on the learnability of certain English idioms, they have the phrase ""A rolling stone gathers no moss"" almost exactly, thus if you presented that idiom to a Japanese speaker, the idea is that this would be learned easier.

Any thoughts? I could Google a bunch of Chinese idioms but I thought I'd reach out to see if any Chinese speakers could provide common

Here are some that I've gathered so far. I am NOT a Chinese speaker so please let me know if any glaring errors here:

两肋插刀 ""stick knives into both sides of your ribs"" [“I’d take a bullet for you”]

说曹操曹操到 － ""speak of the devil and the devil appears"" [""(same in English)""]

入乡随俗 － ""enter village follow customs"" [""When in Rome...""]

Also I am told Chinese has:

""Two heads are better than one""

""Blood is thicker than water""

""The journey of one thousand miles begins with one step""

*this would probably be the easiest to learn for a Chinese speaker

Any thoughts are welcome

**EDIT** per sco_t's comment below: I am definitely interested in literal translations v. English interpretations.  It's important for me to distinguish between ""sayings/expressions"" that are *syntactically* the same in English

For instance, would be the easiest for a Chinese-speaking English learner to learn.  Furthermore, they'd (hypothetically) be able to retain the form as well, if form were emphasized in the quiz.  English interpretations of Chinese expressions might only be easier to learn if *meaning* were emphasized, since the learner need only recall the ""English equivalent"" once it's learned.  

I hope that makes some sense.  So

1. Start with a folder or playlist full of chinesepod lessons that you haven't done yet. Choose one.

2. Listen to it straight through. While you listen

3. Move the Chinesepod lesson to a new ""review"" playlist.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 as many times as you want

5. Review your Anki cards until you know them all.

6. Go back through your review playlist. For each lesson, leave it in the review playlist, review your anki cards more, and try it another day. The dialogs are usually only 30 seconds or so. Just listen to it and move it appropriately.

7. Repeat all the above. By managing the time you spend on each step you can keep a quick pace

The reason this method works well is that it maximizes the potential of ChinesePod. As a daily lesson it's ineffective (IMHO) because there's a low signal-to-noise ratio and not enough repetition. Listening to Ken define each term 3 times in a row is a waste of time! While he's doing that, and just listen to the dialogs. You can review 10 lessons in just a few minutes that way.

Recently

With my job, and I'm consistently doing impressive work. But they dont show me enough appreciation, and as soon as I'm done doing one thing I'm already being told to do something else. Just this weekend they told me to do a delivery which took an hour just to deliver 3 boxes of ice cream to someone's house. Clearly they do not value my time. I'm very good at what I do, but they never want me to be proud because they don't want to admit I go far beyond their expectations. I do about half the work I am able to do because I don't think they deserve to see me at my full potential.

I feel like dad never listens to me

Mom I don't have anything wrong with you or dad when I say I hate being home. I just really feel trapped with all the messy things. I cannot be physically or mentally at ease. 

I'm sorry I haven't been spending time at home

I read a funny conversation online today asking parents what the weirdest thing they've seen their kids do. Also another one asking what the weirdest thing they've found in their kids room. What's your answer?

I also want to know what you write in your journal. Mom what are your hobbies and what do you love to see and do? I feel like I need more hobbies or else ill be sad

Thank you for being ever so forgiving

I had a really mature conversation with my friend recently that reflects how far I've come in terms of how I view the world. I think I'm growing up with a very positive outlook.

Her: Life is hard
Me: that's what I always say
Her: It's true. The more I'm alive the more I'm just so done 
Me: it's not so bad
Her: Not usually. But I'm just very tired and I'm still so young. This society is too fast paced to keep up with. It's too twisted to deserve being kept up with 
Me: Idk girl I feel like we don't have much to complain about
Her:But everything is just so damn complicated.  Humanity had to go and give everyone these unrealistically high expectations and make life really expensive to live if you want to do good things like travel and eat well 
Me: Trust me I used to say the same shit but you gain perspective. we are in NYC, you're given all the food and resources you want and you're free to explore one of the best places in the world. I know that we're young but everyone went through the same thing which is one of the many things to look forward to with age. we have so much freedom compared to the rest of the world. people may have dumb perspectives and biased judgement on who deserves to be at the top of the hierarchy, I know. but even at the bottom were luckier than most parts of the world. I used to complain a lot too before I realized how blessed I am. I realized I should change how I see the world bc there's no point in complaining about things you can't change
Her: Cause having to put so much effort into living is draining  Like obviously hunting for food and surviving is draining too
Me: No one is forcing you to do anything you pursue learning art and whatever you like BECAUSE you like it. If you think you're putting in all this effort and you're not enjoying it then maybe you need to pick a different path. I work as hard as possible  learning all I can about psychology and I lose sleep all the time but in the long run I really enjoy working hard at something. It kind of sounds like you're just complaining for the sake of complaining which is what i did for like my whole life and what a lot of people do

I'm sorry I don't make enough time to talk and spend quality time with the only Two people that deserve it. I waste all my emotion on people that don't care nearly as much about me as I care about them and not even 10% of how much I know you love me.

[**二月二日 天气湿寒**](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_61.html)

月亮升起来时，我抹去眼泪。

一只座头鲸，忽然跃出水面，

在我眼前欢快的跳舞唱歌。

但是我为什么仍然无法遏止

心中那源源不绝的悲伤呢？

------

**Èr yuè èr rì Tiānqì shīhán**

Yuèliàng shēng qǐlái shí

Yī zhī zuòtóujīng

Zài wǒ yǎnqián huānkuài de tiàowǔ chànggē. 

Dànshì wǒ wèishénme réngrán wúfǎ èzhǐ 

Xīnzhōng nà yuányuánbùjué de bēishāng ne?

------

**February Second. Weather: Cold and damp**

As the moon rises

A humpback whale suddenly leaps out of the water

Cheerfully singing and dancing in front of me.

But why am I still unable to stop

This endless stream of sorrow within me?

------

(1) Note the grammar pattern for **when**: ……时 or ……的时候 or 当……时; note also that 每当……时 means **whenever** … 

(2) The term 座头鲸 comes from Japanese: 座头 is Japanese for [琵琶]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa)

(3) Note also that 只 is the correct measure word for 鲸鱼 (whale). It’s a tough word to figure out the measure word (量词) for

(4) 跃出水面 means to **leap** (跃) out of the water. A more common saying is 浮(fú)出水面, e.g., **to emerge.** For example: 真相终会浮出水面的 = **the truth always comes out in the end**

(5) 眼前欢快 should be read as 眼前 欢快; the first three characters form a separate phrase [眼前欢](http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E7%9C%BC%E5%89%8D%E6%AC%A2/67793) meaning **fleeting pleasure**

(6) In English

(7) There’s a typo in the link

(8) 源源不绝 is a chengyu (four character idiom). Literally, wiping tears, whale in the sea, +stream of sorrow).
