My whole family is right handed so growing up I was taught how to do things with my right hand (and foot). I was real young so it was simple things like throwing a ball or coloring. Both of which I did poorly. My parents never considered the idea that I should be using the other hand


Things go along fine up until first grade. My teacher was quick to notice that I had a lot of trouble with writing. Aside from the lack of ability to make a straight line


After a few weeks of coaching I still couldn't get it. After a conference with my teacher, it was miserable. 


After about two weeks of plodding through my special classes the new teacher decided to try a radical experiment. She took the pencil out of my right hand and put it into my left. I swear it was like a scene straight out of *Miracle Worker*. All of a sudden I could write all my letters correctly. I was flying through my assignments with a great new found confidence. So the teacher decided it was time for another conference. This time they brought the principal in and rather than sending me back to my old class they skipped me ahead to second grade. 


I have been a proud southpaw ever since.

**Cars:** American or European the ignition is always on the right side of the steering wheel. 
  
**Lawnmowers** as well as most small engines have the pull rope mounted to be used with the right hand.
  
**Cameras:** Most controls are operated with the right hand. 
  
**Cellphones:** Volume button designed to be used with index finger rather than thumb. Models with buttons have the end button on the right side and if you hold it left handed your cheek bone hangs up.  

**Guns:** If you don't own one or have never shot then you may not realize that the super hot spent shell almost always ejects to the right which has to cross right in front of your face. Operating the safety of a gun is nearly impossible. There are left handed guns
  
**Tweezers:** I have a nice pair of tweezers and I realized one side is much sharper than the other which makes them work better right handed because the thinner side slides under the hair or splinter much easier.  
  
**Circular saws:** Dust in my eyes every time.   
  
**Chainsaws:** For safety reasons i have learned to use right handed (right hand on throttle). Chainsaws are just dangerous and should not be operated any other way than they were designed either left or right handed. 
  
**Most knives:** Most knives in the kitchen have only one edge ground down or they have one side that is flat and the other beveled. When cutting with the left hand and holding with the right the blade tends to scoop outward.  
  
**Measuring cups:** in the US display metric when held with the left hand.

However

[Cursor of Dread.](http://i.imgur.com/JnrJn.gif)

As a left-hander, but your visual feedback suggests it's coming from the right. This discord throws every line I draw, making work impossible.

The main problem is, but alas I cannot find the option.

Windows have a set of left-handed cursors available to replace the default ones

You can set 'precise' cursors, and I have no choice but to use it.

It's hugely disappointing, however, so I'm not sure if I'm surprised.

1339313391.0,uucs3,"Fellow southpaws, what is the reasoning behind the ""lefty way"" and the ""righty way"" to hold utensils such as golf clubs and baseball bats? Because to me, it makes NO sense. ",Satans_Paw,40,29, with the exception of using computer mice and toilet paper

For example, with the bat over your left shoulder. Honestly, this makes no sense to me. In both these scenarios, the non-dominant hand is placed at the end of the equipment, which seems wrong...it seems the dominant hand should be placed at the end since it has the most control. That's how I hold them, with the dominant hand at the end of the utensil.

Here's the way I hold things

**Pistol**: Held in left hand

**Rifle**: Left hand on trigger with right hand on forestock with the gun resting on my left shoulder

**Hockey Stick**: Left hand on top

**Baseball Bat**: Left hand on bottom, standing on the left side of the plate from the umpire's point of view. (or standing on the right side of the plate from the pitcher's point of view)

**Tennis Racket forehand**: Left hand on grip swinging from the mid/bottom left side up to right shoulder

**Tennis Racket backhand**: Left hand on bottom

**Bow &amp; Arrow**: Left hand back holding arrow

**Lacrosse Stick**: Left hand on top

**Golf Club**: Left hand on top, I would be to the left of the golf ball)

Here's the part that I don't get: in some of these situations, as I'm using the same ""rules"" to hold each object: My dominant hand (left) is on the end and my non-dominant hand (right) is above/below that hand depending on the situations....it's in between my dominant hand (left) and the end of the utensil. 

Why aren't all of these the ""left handed"" way? **I mean I'm using the same pattern for each of them

I start my reasoning with guns; a lefty obviously holds a pistol with their left hand. And a lefty obviously holds a rifle with their left hand back on the trigger and their right hand up at the forestock (up near the barrel). Therefore, their left hand would be on top at the trigger and their right hand would be on bottom, near the barrel. 

Now replace that rifle with a hockey stick or golf club. This **SHOULD** be the way a lefty holds a hockey stick or golf club. But it isn't. **WHY?** Similarly, so I'm performing this the ""lefty way."" Shouldn't this mean that a left-handed golfer should have the same hand positioning, also swinging up to the left shoulder from the bottom right side of the body? I mean that's how I also golf. **BUT NO**, the apparently ""correct"" way for a lefty to swing a golf club is to stand to the right of the ball (from the POV of someone standing directly behind you), with you left hand on bottom and right hand on top--the complete opposite of how I golf. 

**So what you're telling me is that if you take a left-handed tennis backhand, you're performing a right-handed golf swing?**

Also playing cards... for the longest time every time I would fan out the cards I wouldn't be able to see the numbers and would have to change and fan them out the other way! So now I think I fan them the ""right-handed way"" and still try to hold them with my right when I dig through the cards with my left... but they are a bit harder to hold onto this way... anyone else?

I started the analysis by [removing some answer groups](http://i.imgur.com/X0y1KLM.png) completely, or only had a single answer.

Next up, with many of them having p-values of over 0.90. Technically speaking, that means we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the proportions being identical. Practically speaking, I don't believe for a second there truly is a statistical difference between the groups, any of them.

This would mean that among all groups with a clear and stated preference for how they [eat corn on the cob](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=345x150&amp;chl=In%20spirals%2C%20%5B191%5D%7CIn%20rows%2C%20ma%20%5B334%5D%7COther%20%5B32%5D&amp;chco=ff9900&amp;chd=e%3AV8mXDr), how they didn't really have a preference, but mostly that they don't eat corn while it's on the cob. For details, refer to the first paragraph of this post.

For anyone interested in why anyone would do such a silly poll: I got the idea after I came across [this article](http://bentilly.blogspot.co.il/2010/08/analysis-vs-algebra-predicts-eating.html) via [a comment by ammicha](/r/math/comments/1j9ghw/between_algebra_and_analysis_are_most_people/cbch57f).
