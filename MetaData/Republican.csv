I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering

That being said

This is for the moderate Republicans: Figuratively speaking, and hustle!!! If you don't, the more extreme elements of your party will, and they will define the next 4 years of conservative politics. At that point, with a potentially more extreme platform, or even the same one you have now, you will be 4 more years behind the curve in the demographics game, and i urge you not to listen to anyone who says that the reason Romney lost was because he was not conservative enough. Socially moderate and fiscally conservative is the recipe


EDIT: It would be extremely beneficial if, and it would draw in more latino's (who made the difference this time around).

Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Susan Davis, a limited Federal Government and Strong States Rights. We need to reform education in this country, we need to take control of education from the Federal Government and return it to the States. We need to overhaul health care in this country, and that does not include the Affordable Care Act, which is anything but affordable. We need to rethink Federal Cancer research to benefit those who will most benefit from it. We must stop paying foreign countries to be our allies, and instead use that money to pay down our national debt.

We must get the Federal Government to live up to the First Amendment of the Constitution and recognize the Establishment Clause; thereby getting the government out of the business of marriage. We have tried the route of Federal Law, not a county mired in partisan fighting and fractured beliefs. We must, and we can do better to advance the American ideal; the ideal of a better tomorrow. We owe this to our children, we owe this to all children. I hope you join me in this belief. You can connect with me at www.susandavisforgeorgia.com

Abortion: Give it up. The Supreme Court ruled. Listen to Boortz. This fight is over. Besides

Ten Commandments/Prayer In Schools = again, it is wrong when people try to silence all religious expression just because they don't like it. No, that does not mean our nation was founded on Christian principles. Deists were not Christians. The 18th Century was not a period in which religion was all the rage. The Ten Commandments are not the foundation of American law. Only the lines about adultery, stealing, and killing relate even a little. 

Where Obama was born = give it up. He has already served 3/4 of a term. This argument is already over. 

Gay Marriage = I am married and straight. Why do I care if gay people get married? Did I somehow join some company with a logo that says ""Married People of the World"" who's trademark will be sullied if gay people marry? I don't give a shit about this issue. Let them marry or don't

Stop the freaking bible thumping religious bullshit and address spending. That is the only reason I ever voted republican. I want to keep my money. I want people who suck at working and studying in school to get their justice and live poor lives without me being robbed to give them cable TV and beer. I'm tired of being shaken upside down by liberals who's fundamental policies I agree with but who feel the best way to make their guilt over the suffering of others go away is to take my money and give it to someone else

Increasing taxes is stupid. Why would we give even MORE money to the government when it has utterly failed to manage the money we already gave them? 

Where is the party that represents my financial interests, you screw EVERYTHING up and work on all the wrong things. BTW, I am not voting for that moron Palin nor Gingrich. Not Trump either.

Guys, and other wack-job theories, we are lowering ourselves to the same level as the left on MSNBC, and I now understand the unfortunate reputation that conservatives have in the liberal media. I don't agree with Obama either, he is a liberal who is moving our country farther down the path to socialism, but we need to compose ourselves and focus on the issues. When we start name calling and shouting accusations, we, have already lost the argument. 
We need to get back to the small-government and fiscal responsibility values that were established in our party's platform

1352472240.0,12wx68,Soul searching? Straight-talk solutions…,fellowtraveler,99,32,52,"Here goes…

--- **Recapture the moral high ground.** The Republican party used to _stand_ for something, gun control, abortion, etc (their own top issues.) What would happen to the Democratic party, in such circumstances? The same is true with the Republicans and their issues:

* Republicans used to stand for **tax reform** and **financial liberty.** But now they are the party of the Federal Reserve,** and not worthy of being patched. It's a moral issue. **All tax talk needs to center around real, fundamental reform.** (An accountant -- a _democrat_ -- told me, last year: _""The current tax code is like a giant pile of horse shit, and they just keep putting whipped cream on top of it. What they need to do is throw the whole thing out and start fresh. But not yet -- wait a few more years until I retire."")_

* Republicans used to stand for **strong national defense, and let's stimulate local economies with local bases instead. Stop the invasions, and remember the bald eagle with the arrows and the olive branch. Say to the world: **We're going home. America will no longer attack any nations unless our national defense is threatened.** (And woe to those who attack us, for they will awaken a sleeping giant.)

* Republicans used to stand for **limited government.** Turn every issue into a State's Rights issue. Appeal to the Constitution. Any power not explicitly enumerated to the Federal government is reserved to the States and the People. Stop debating legislation based on its merits, redundant, or overreaching agencies. Appeal to Thomas Jefferson and use his quotes whenever a debate comes up.


--- Go after traditionally Democratic constituencies

* **Blacks.** Many in the Republican party seem to believe that blacks are a lost cause (not worth campaigning to.) This is a mistake, socialist educational system is the modern equivalent of forbidding slaves to read. (The elite must keep us dumbed-down in order to rule over us.) Condemn the public system on moral grounds and make a real push for educational reform. (Such as ending all Federal educational controls, giving all the power to the states, and letting them experiment with statewide voucher systems, etc.) Anything is better than the failed, broken system we have now. Give people freedom of choice in education and make it clear that parents, not bureaucrats

* **The poor.** Poor people do not actually want social welfare programs, and a place to sleep, and the opportunity to better their lives and the lives of their children. Consider for a moment the FairTax. This revenue-neutral proposal is quite simple: eliminate ALL Federal taxes, then replace them with a single retail sales tax of 23%, and then send a monthly reimbursement cheque to all households covering the amount of tax normally paid up to the poverty line. For example, poverty in 2011 for a family with three children, is defined as $26, this means the family pays $6, all in one fell swoop.** On top of that

* **Women.** It's a known fact that married women vote Republican, because stupid Republicans keep getting caught saying the word ""rape."" SHUT UP! If a reporter asks you, _""Should abortion be illegal even in the case of rape or incest?""_ The proper answer is not, _""God meant for you to get raped, God works in mysterious ways.""_ Wrong wrong wrong! The proper answer is, _""Of course not. Think about all the millions of helpless, innocent babies that would still be alive today if those horrible circumstances really were the only legitimate justification for abortion. Nevertheless, and the Federal government has no place cramming the murder of babies down the throats of good, _""Slut!""_ Wrong wrong wrong! The proper answer is

* **Hispanics.** Hispanics are good, after Democrats had been the party of the Ku Klux Klan for decades. But LBJ, sensing that change was in the air, took credit for the act and used it as an opportunity to hijack the black community into the Democratic fold. LBJ famously said, _“I'll have those niggers voting Democratic for the next 200 years.”_ So… now that the southern border is well-protected (by drones) it's time to make a decision about the people who are already here, and let them live in peace. Republicans should become their champions, and push for an immigration reform bill that gives them peace, deportation of criminals


--- **Unify the Liberty movement with the Christian base.** Does anyone else notice how disrespectfully the mainline Republican party treats Ron Paul and the Liberty movement? And does anyone notice how disrespectfully the Liberty movement speaks of the Christian right? It's a shame because these groups would make natural allies. In fact, wrote that Jesus Christ had devised the highest system of morals the world had ever seen. A few of Ron Paul's positions need to be taken seriously and adopted by the Republican party, if they don't wish to slip into obscurity. For example:

* **End the Fed.** This is the Internet age, not a centralized, authoritarian cartel.

* **End the Patriot Act.** It totally destroys any credibility the Republicans had on the issue of Freedom. Get rid of it.

* Make a push for **fair representation

* **Stop meddling with Israel.** We get hit with tornados and hurricanes every time we try. Get entirely out of Israel's way and set them free to deal with their neighbors in whatever way they see fit, my special possession, for scattering my people among the nations, and for dividing my land.""_

* **Eliminate foreign aid.** At the very least

* Liberty advocates and Christians actually have quite a bit in common. The way to win over Christians is not to force baby-murder down their throats. Rather,** can get behind Scriptures such as these:

--Edit: Just wanted to make it clear that the purpose of these Scriptures is not to convince Liberty advocates to be more Christian. **Rather

I stand before you as a voter who has voted mostly DFL / Independent for the last two elections

First off, I am for fiscal conservatism at both state and federal levels. Out of control spending, debt riding, and bailouts must be checked, and the fiscal conservatism of the old Republican party can help us get out of that hole. Finally, I am for a scaled back federal government (minus the judicial system) that ties to the first point of giving states more power over their governments. 

That is all well and good, and there is no place in my conscious for many of the other platforms the GOP has taken. If the GOP is about personal freedom, then tryout religion out of my government. I don't mean to say people shouldn't be guided by their personal views, this is inevitable, but drop the reliance on Jesus and the Christian demagoguery. There is a real conversation to be had about abortion, that doesn't include simple write-offs due to your religious views. It is not black and white, and anybody that has actually looked at the issue should know this. Next, it's 2012 people. There are many other ways to raise a family.

According to several websites


I'm unable to contact the office in Iowa for voter fraud because its completely closed down.  I wanted to vote for a candidate and I'm not able to because of these assholes!  Who the hell can I contact to have this resolved?

Edit.  I contacted the Ron Paul office to see if it was going on and they said it is.  It turns out that I'm not the only having this problem and that there were 6 calls about this problem.

Edit 2: I managed to talk two a couple of different numbers and they said to check it out again.  I did

Edit 3:  One of the phone numbers that I contacted shortly before I visited the place the second time didn't really help me.  Apparently the person on the phone was giving me caucus location in a completely different city and was arguing with me.  When the guy finally figured out where I was at, never calling me back.

Hi guys.

So it's come to my attention that I actually have no idea what the Republican Party is supposed to be about.  It clicked recently that I'm doing the exact same thing people in my party blame Republicans for...listening only to my ""side"" and not getting both sides of the argument.  And I know exactly WHY I do this

1. I was raised in a Democratic house.  This included my mother (recently divorced from my father, my grandparents on my mother's side (both Democratic), my aunt (Democratic), and her boyfriend (I have no clue).

Given the typical viewpoint of my party, Suburban, and grew up in the 1950s.  My Grandfather was apparently raised Catholic, but I never had a religion pushed on me as a child (my parents thought it would be wrong).  But they weren't.  The reason I'm telling you this is so you know MY background.  I'm white, male, solidly Middle Class, grew up in mostly cohesive family

Because of my Democratic background I've never questioned that it was MY party.  Hell

So in the interested of becoming a more informed

I think you have a sub-party that basically stands for Biblical law (or their interpretation of it) but they're REALLY loud and Religion in general isn't my thing.  I looked into a bunch of religions, mostly white) who appear unwilling or unable to adapt to the world around them.

Congratulations to the Democrats and Young People!  You now own it.   
The next terrorist attack you own it.   
Can't get a job after graduation
Sky rocketing energy prices due to Obama's EPA shutting down the energy producing states
A nuclear Iran
Bowing to the Soviet Union
Another severe recession
A volatile border with Mexico
Trouble getting good health care
Higher heath insurance costs and health care costs
No budget
Our allies mistrust
Another trillion of debt
More Benghazi situations
No one willing to join the military
Trouble getting a loan to buy a home
More dependency on food stamps
Trouble finding good employment
Several part time jobs instead of a good job
A World Government
The UN governing the United States instead of ourselves
A Senate that will not bring any legislation to the table rather it is ""Dead on Arrival""
China controlling our world trade trampling all over us
Loss of our freedoms as we have known it in the past
A dictatorship instead of a democracy that follows the Constitution
Less take home pay and higher living costs
Driving a car that looks like a toy
More government corruption and lies
More toleration of extreme and fanatical Islamists
Terrorist attacks called work place incidents
Your revenge instead of love of country
President George Bush is out of it now
In a way I am relieved that another good man will not be blamed when it was impossible to clean up this mess you voted for.

Specifically I am interested in all the differences in thinking
I follow US News reports pretty closely and also
These concerns where raised on reddit in a previous post about the issue. The poster made a comperision to the Canadian public healthcare system. Althou immidiatly after this kind of posts a few Canadians showed up and refuted each and every one of these concernes nobody seemed to even care what they had to say. From my own experience with the Austrian public healthcare system I have to tell you that such concernes are blatantly fabricated lies. I never ever even heard of such things and I should because my mother was a nurse in the emergency tract of our hospital

Also I am close friends with many germans, the Netherlands and Dutch and not a single one of them ever lost a bad word about their system. Don`t get me wrong, of course it is not 100% perfect, but then again, no system is. 

I think my real question is, make of this? Do you honestly think that our system is that bad?  I mean, in light of this, shouldn’t it be obvious that these fears have no basis in reality? Or do you maybe think that your government wouldn’t implement the neccecary  changes  to your system adequately enough? Or is it something else entirely? I heard the argument that some, or many people in the republican party don’t want to pay for other peoples health, that they see public health care as some kind of charity or as a kind of infringement on their personal freedom to choose to give to others. But, isn’t that a very selfisch argument? I mean, you give some of your money away for others

Ok, I`m sure there are many arguments that I am not aware of as a non US citizen. It just seems odd to me that a system in which I grew up in and which never gave me any concern is so demonized in another country.

Also, I thank you for taking the time to read this article and hope we can share our opinions :)",,False,self,t5_2qndt,False,,

Mitt Romney tried to be Bush 2.0

First of all, yet still personal. Obama exudes personality while Romney was a wet noodle of social awkwardness. The prime presidential candidate should be a man who we would respect among world leaders, not someone who looks like they're two sentences away from a cultural gaffe. This candidate should also seem privy to sitting down and having a beer with the average American. And no, quoting a thirteen year old song while awkwardly surrounded by black people is not connecting to America, it's just being awkward. 

Secondly

Rather focus on the most important issues, and limited government. You can't claim you want to limit government, then push for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. Nor can you claim it, when you then in the same breathe say the government should take away the right to choose. People will see through your ruse.  Again, this is concessions. What's more important, that Todd and Mark don't get married or Brenda doesn't get that abortion, or that you're able to not be taxed out of your home? Let's be real

1331143138.0,qm00m,My Response to the State of the GOP,THE_REPUBLICAN,55,13,76,"Some was asking about the state of the GOP and why so many people seem to like Santorum over at r/circlejerk *cough* excuse me




**Republican here:** To speak frankly the GOP is at war with itself. Right now there are two sides of our party. There are more the more traditional to what we might now call progressive conservatives who are essentially purely fiscally minded

The new social conservative movement is very interesting. These are your bible thumpers, if you look at the neo-con movement championed by Barry Goldwater in '64, those guys look liberal compared to Santorum. Essentially whats gone on in my opinion is that these new social conservatives have found a way to tie their message in with the evangelical message which such a great deal of our nation lives by in order to gain footing with in the Republican party.

Now on the other hand you have your traditional Republicans who we must now label as progressive conservatives. These are your fiscal conservatives. Your Jon Huntsmans, and Mitt Romney before he became a mega-technocrat. These are the guys who essentially see capitalism as a pyramid, like the system and want to work with it. I understand a lot of you reading might disagree, but this is the group who champion the growth of the middle and elevation of the upper-class'. These are the guys who your parents or grandparents voted for during the civil rights movement. They would like to focus on fiscal and foreign policy but over the past 50 years have slowly had to change their message to accommodate the growing voice of evangelical voters.

**Heres an example:** Take a look at Mitt Romney when he ran for Senate in MA in 1994. MA is progressive, Romney is a governor of MA with national ambitions and he has to change his message to align with voters on a national scale, not just in MA.

**Whats happening now** in our party is that voters on both sides are fed up. I was at CPAC a few weeks ago and you could've cut the tension in the air with a knife. The social conservatives found anything that my fiscally minded friends and I said about things like legalizing gay marriage

**Take a look at the candidacy of Jon Huntsman** as a testament to all this. Governor Huntsman was the candidate that the Obama administration was most worried about come November. He had a great record as Governor of Utah, if you broach this subject with any of these new-found hardliners they will call Huntsman Obama2.0. They will neglect things like the fact that the Governor from Utah had the best tax plan of any of the candidates and was endorsed by the Wall Street Journal, They will neglect that he put his country above partisan affiliation, etc. .etc. Why? because the Governor wanted to be a unifying force, he didn't want to play into the Us vs. THEM mentality. Unfortunately, that is what it take to get votes as a Republican right now--hence the ""flip-flopping"" of Gov. Romney
As a Republican

**Option 1:** Santorum wins nomination--gets absolutely fucked in the ass by Obama on election day and the GOP immediately begins to ween off of their support of politicians like Santorum and social issues slowly become a thing of the past.

**Option 2:** Romney wins nomination--loses in a close election to Obama--the New Right yells ""we told you so"" and the Republicans endorse Santorum like candidate for the next mid-term election. Those candidates win in some states and lose in others

**Option 3:** Romeny wins nomination and Presidency--Romneys true colors show and the GOP begins to SLOWLY move back toward the center with both large and small roadbumps along the way at every mid-term election.

What is see as most likely is that the GOP is on the verge of breaking into two parties. The social conservatives vs. the fiscal conservatives. There was a great article in the Huffington Post the other day describing how there is a new silent majority in America who think were on the verge of a 3rd party.

**Your social policies drive away independent voters.**

For a group of people who claim to adamantly defend small government and freedom, pushing Jesus in the classroom, supporting foreign war, and continuing the painfully failed war on drugs are keeping the focus off of important economic truths that the democrats lose badly on.

If you want to win elections, you should abandon it.  Something that you should realize is that if it is in the Bible, why do you need a law to enforce God's words?   Why not just follow them yourselves, you know; live and let live?

Some good rules of thumb:

* Don't like gay marriage?  Don't get gay married.
 
* Don't like drugs?  Don't do them.

* Don't like gambling?  Don't gamble.

* Don't like other religions?  Don't follow them.

Etc... Just my humble suggestion.

Also those hardcore conservatives that freak about taking God out of the government and/or preventing their worship. If a church allows gay marriage how would a ban not affect ""their"" religion?

More importantly: why should the government give a shit what two people do? I bet most Republicans deep down don't really care one way or the other. Unfortunately our party has let the vocal

I am becoming increasingly frustrated by this. This issue has been brought up so many times, the person was. Everyone knows this, or at least I thought I did. For people to then oversimplify this to the point where you're just placing blame on the actual gun, it's becoming absurd. There's a phrase that says ""If you outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws"". Should this madmen should have never been allowed to own a gun? In hindsight, of course.

1323141699.0,n20gd,Why Liberal Republicanism Needs To Make a Comeback and How It Can Save The GOP. ,LettersFromTheSky,32,10,11,"Just my thoughts and opinion here:

Needless to say, it may actually deserve being called the Grand Old Party again. Before we go much further, I'd like to define what Liberalism actually is:

Liberalism is the political philosophy that holds equal rights and liberty as the basic moral principle of society guaranteed by a legal document (Constitution) and protected by Government. 

Why does the decline and fall of Liberal Republicanism matter? After all, ""a choice, not an echo."" The demonizing of Liberalism by Conservative media outlets offers a vivid illustration of the Republican Party's mutation from a vibrant and diverse coalition to the dogmatic cult of conservative ideology that it has become today. The drive for ideological purity continues to this day, with Tea Party groups and fundraisers such as the Club for Growth targeting moderate conservatives after the liberals went extinct. First they came for the Liberals, then they came for the moderate conservatives, now all you have is the Republican base. In recent years, they helped force out Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, but narrows the Republican base. This will eventually (if not already) hinder the GOP's ability to win elections. I  believe none of the current GOP Presidential candidates will beat Obama. 

But it turns out that a Republican Party dominated by conservatives is no more coherent or effective at governing than a party dominated by progressives. The huge budget deficit left by George Bush is conservatism's Waterloo, we'll end up with something that neither parties will be happy with and the deficit will be reduced a fraction of what it could have been. 

Paradoxically, to-the-barricades politics. It produced fiscal responsibility, a less dysfunctional government and a sense of responsible governing that voters like. 

Arguably

Hence why Liberal Republican is what we desperately need today in the atmosphere of partisan political venom that has our nation locked in a vise grip and has created one of the most dysfunctional Congresses in modern history. 

Thoughts, opinions? 

PS. I actually happen to be a Liberal Democrat (who grew up in a Conservative home) and I write this not to attack Republicans,  I have a feeling a lot of moderate Republicans can relate to what I'm pointing out here. My parents who have been staunch Republican voters for as long as I can remember are pretty unhappy with the current Republican field of candidates and the direction of their political party. And no, I do not consider Ron Paul as a Liberal Republican. He is a Libertarian, which is the extreme form of Liberalism. Frankly, I don't even know why he considers himself a Republican - he's more of a independent.
