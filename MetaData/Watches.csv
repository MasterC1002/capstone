Have quality watches such as the Omega Speedmaster always been a luxury item for the wealthy or could an average Joe buy one? I collected data from 1959-2011 and compared the median household annual income with the price of the Speedmaster. The percentage of the price of the Speedmaster of the annual income gives a good measure on how affordable the watch has been to an average person through the decades. Here's the data.

| Year | Median Household Income | Price of Omega Speedmaster | Percentage |
|-----------:|------------:|------------:|----------:|
|1959	|$6 600	|$195	|2.95%
|1968	|$6 668	|$185	|2.77%
|1973	|$9 227	|$225	|2.44%
|1985	|$22 080	|$1 295	|5.87%
|1991	|$28 819	|$1 500	|5.20%
|1996	|$34 652	|$2 295	|6.62%

1330836887.0,qgtdm,My Dad Gave Me My First Submariner Last Night,mikewinsone,206,26,32,"Last night my dad gave me my first Rolex. He had been saving 2 Submariners for my brother and I. My brother recently passed away at the young age of 26. I am 28. 

My dad sat me down last night and explained to me that he'd been waiting to do this for a while but wanted to wait until my brother ""made it"". I've been working in software development for the last 7 years and have achieved my dreams, but didn't make it through the hard times. 

My brother was found dead in his condo 2 months ago tomorrow. 

It's been a rough couple of months loosing my brother. We're only 18 months apart and have always been close even when we went through times of not spending much time together. 

I have a couple of his watches

When my dad sat me down and presented me with this green leather box I immediatly broke down. I know what these watches mean to my dad. He wears a couple of submariners and an explorer. 

I speant a few minutes crying and hugging him because I knew this had to do with my brother's passing somehow. We stayed up until 2am talking about life

He explained to me that he gave me the watch because he wants me to understand the appreciation for excellence he has and that he thinks that I have gotten there and deserve it. It feels weird to wear a watch like this at my age but every time I look at it I think about him

My dad started something of a tradition this weekend. I hope to carry it on.

1365308816.0,1bu54b,[Omega] A Job Offer,Isochronasm,191,17,44,"I know this isn't the type of thing usually posted on this subreddit but I thought some of you might be interested. This would usually fall under the ""no spam"" rule so I got the consent of the moderators first. 

I have a job offer I would like to extend to the /r/watches[1]  community. I work at an Omega service center in Seattle WA. and our case prep technician is leaving us soon and we are in need of a replacement. The job doesn't require any experience working with watches

The main focus of your job is to disassemble and reassemble the case components of a watch. The case components include but are not limited to the case middle, bezel and bracelet. You will learn how to tear down a case, clean it, change the gaskets, replace helium valves, replace chronograph pushers, repair bracelets and completely reassemble everything so it is ready to go back to the customer. It is important that the case is completely clean and resealed before the movement is placed back inside to ensure that debris and moisture don't contaminate anything. Many Omega watches are designed to be taken diving and need to be tested in a pressurized water tank before the movement is put back in and once again after the watch is fully assembled. You will receive training on the operation of these water testers as well as the dry tester that uses compressed air and vacuum to test how airtight the watch is. There are many Omega specific tools you will be trained with as well as standard machinery found in almost all watch repair facilities. 

The shop itself is pretty unique in a lot of ways. It is the only Swatch Group US service center that is attached to an active boutique. There is a large bank of windows that separates the service center from the sales floor, Glashutte and a few others). 

Almost no one has applied for this position so far and no one has sat for a bench test yet. I think this is because most people don't even know that the luxury watch repair industry even exists and this job is kind of a niche inside of that industry. That and the job description on careerbuilder is absolutely terrible. http://www.careerbuilder.com/JobSeeker/Jobs/JobDetails.aspx?APath=2.31.0.0.0&amp;job_did=JB74P8696XL4X8KQP3C&amp;IPath=ILKV0A[2]

Description:

I think the greatest value in finely crafted watches can be found in old American pocket watches. We often think of Swiss watches as the top of watchmaking today, with American railroad grade being the quality mark of an accurate timepiece. It seems incomprehensible now, but once upon a time, the Swiss made fakes of American watches to fool unsuspecting customers into believing they were buying a quality American-made timepiece. 

These classic American watches were hand-made

Since pocket watches have largely fallen out of style

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced

I wasn't mainly there for the watches, me and my friend had a great time, and I encourage any watch enthusiast to do the same.   
The purpose for me was simply to see certain watches in person, nor did I give any indications that I was going to buy one. I guess they just recognized that we were enthusiasts.   
  
I had marked a few places on the map, had boutiques in, or around fifth avenue and 57st street. And walking casually up Madison avenue from St. Patrick's cathedral, you'll pass many of the most well known luxury brands. 
http://i.imgur.com/Nri7DT5.jpg  

First up was probably the brand I'm liking best of the luxury watch makers, we were greeted by a guard that opened the door for us. A rather dimly lit store, we met a very polite gentleman that offered to show us anything we wanted. I had ambitions of trying the 1945, the 1966 and the new Seahawk. Sadly, the pictures I took here were by far the worst, but the watches were probably among those I liked the most. The new Seahawk is completely bad ass, with amazing details, despite it being huge. The 1945 is just gorgeous

http://i.imgur.com/HFjnVlQh.jpg  

The guy in the store asked where we were from, and no one else was in the store - so I assumed he had nothing better to do than to chat with us. We expected the stores to gradually fill up over the course of the day, but this wasn't the case. Remarkably quiet in every boutique, maybe except for IWC. But I'll get back to that.   
  
We went further up the street until we came across **F. P. Journe**. Now, let alone one in Madison Ave, but there it was. A really tall guy who obviously had struggled with his tie that morning greeted us. Well, he didn't look too interested in us at first, but warmed up when I took interest in the complications of one of the pieces. What interested me the most here was a super light sports watch in titanium (I believe), which honestly had the weight of a kids' Swatch. It wasn't a pretty watch, but damn

http://i.imgur.com/Kjb0L7Hh.jpg  
  
I forgot to mark PFJ on the map, after being blown away by Girard Perregaux. A lady took us further into the store, also relatively dimly lit, to show us some models. I don't know. The Overseas just didn't click for me, but they do make some extremely nice looking dress watches, and their tourbillon - the actual visual design of their tourbillon is cool.

http://i.imgur.com/BdNLwcTh.jpg    
This was, which I guess can be a reason why I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the watches. I guess I can understand that. Here we are, two guys in sneakers wearing plastic and quartz watches...    But then again, that didn't seem to matter a single bit to the people over at....
  
  
**Breguet** (1 on map). Where we were greeted by a super happy lady, in contrast to the first three stores, which seemed a bit cramped.

Just as enthusiastic, she presented herself as, was chatty, and showed us around the store, gave us a few tips on where to eat, and let us try what ever we wanted. She got really excited when we told her about the Knicks game we were going to, later that day. She was a big fan herself, but was more than happy to show pictures of it. She also said she had always managed to not be at work when the famous people came by
http://i.imgur.com/K3VerQ7h.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/sUAGUpFh.jpg  
  
  
Also, had a store, but we didn't go inside. **DeGrisogono** (13 on map) also had a boutique, but I was for some reason a bit intimidated.  
http://i.imgur.com/wF6NKefh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/j8wTYzhh.jpg  
  
We went back to fifth avenue, nor did I visit **Omega**, or the adjacent **Breguet** boutique (8 on map) . In retrospect, maybe I should have, but if there were crowds inside a watch store, it would be those two. We went inside **Harry Winston** (7 on map), but their stock of watches was a bit underwhelming.   
Stores I also failed to visit were **Cartier** (who along with Rolex has their very own buildings, **Van Cleef and Arples** (known for their weird retrogrades, 11 on map).   
  
A place we did enter, the biggest one, called **Time Machine** (6 on map), is located in the same building as Niketown. I believe this is one of the Trump buildings. Four stories filled with watches, ranging from Casio digital watches to Patek Philippe torubillons. This place was fun, but far less personal, and inviting than the boutiques. The first floor had mid range like Rolex, Cartier. Stuff like that. On the ground floor, and could be considered half a floor at best
What we found on the fourth floor was a limited selection of pretty much any luxury watch brand you could imagine. My friend quickly located Zenith

http://i.imgur.com/7uLNZUZh.jpg  

I swear to god, and he just ran out of the store after trying it on. 
  
Further down Madison Avenue we found **Tourneau's** other store (10 on map), but pretty close. At this point, me and my friend was almost numbed by seeing all these great watches, and the sight of a complicated JLC seemed almost insignificant. Almost.  
http://i.imgur.com/h5fhV79h.jpg    
http://i.imgur.com/7AbTF9Zh.jpg  
http://i.imgur.com/oYmSuIKh.jpg    
  
Not far away we found **IWC** and **Panerai's** boutiques (9 on map). Neither of us has any interest in Panerai, this was just a marvelous place. IWC has worked a lot with building their image, and this store was by far the most elaborate of the places we visited. They had unique sections of their store dedicated to their individual lines. For instance, the pilot models were placed in and around something that looked like a pilot's lockerroom. The Portuguese was given room in a huge bookshelf containing various travel effects. Aquatimer was located inside a shower room. My friend tried on the gorgeous Vintage Ingenieur, and almost pulled the trigger. This one is becoming rarer by the minute. He would have gotten a good deal on it as well. He regretted it almost immediately.

Finally, this was prime time, around 3-4pm, and once again we found ourselves alone in the store. We met with Manuela, who was more than happy to let us fondle with various Royal Oak models. What a watch. The blue faced one was my absolute favorite of the day, but the gold on leather wasn't bad either. Even my friend, who has been vocal in his distaste for the RO, but with added New York sales tax and import tax

She looks slightly different to the image in the [database](http://www.omegawatches.com/spirit/history/vintage-omegas/vintage-watches-database?ref=14528). Maybe someone at r/watches has a little more information on why that is? I haven't seen any more of this type on the internet and was immediately attracted to the design as well as rarity. Hope you guys enjoy looking at her as much as I do.

*Preámbulo a las instrucciones para dar cuerda al reloj*



Piensa en esto: cuando te regalan un reloj te regalan un pequeño infierno florido, que los cumplas muy felices y esperamos que te dure porque es de buena marca, suizo con áncora de rubíes; no te regalan solamente ese menudo picapedrero que te atarás a la muñeca y pasearás contigo. Te regalan —no lo saben, lo terrible es que no lo saben—, te regalan un nuevo pedazo frágil y precario de ti mismo, algo que es tuyo pero no es tu cuerpo, que hay que atar a tu cuerpo con su correa como un bracito desesperado colgándose de tu muñeca. Te regalan la necesidad de darle cuerda todos los días, en el anuncio por la radio, y la seguridad de que es una marca mejor que las otras

*Preamble to instructions for winding a watch:*


Ponder this: when they gift you a watch they gift you a tiny, a prison of air. They do not gift you just the watch, that they give very happily and we hope that is lasts you because it is of good brand, Swiss with a pallet of rubies; they do not gift you just this tiny stonemason that will tie to your wrist and go with you. They gift you-- they do not know it, how terrible it is that they do not know--, they gift you a new fragile and precious piece of yourself, something that is yours but is not your body, the obligation to wind it in order for it to continue being a watch; they gift you the obsession of attending to the exact hour in the windows of jewelery stores, that you will fall and break it. They gift you its brand,

The ""J880.2"" movement they refer to is, but I don't consider it a problem.

I put the original calfskin strap away in a box and had a custom strap made for it by Jeanna at Stone Creek straps.  She did a great job with it.  I generally like the brown leather/black watch combination

[There was this guy - Col. William Pogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Pogue) - he was a U.S.A.F. veteran of the Korean War

In the training prior to launch, and then used it every day.  He specifically states he used it to time engine burns.  When the time came for launch he was supposed to leave his Seiko behind... but he snuck it aboard hidden in the leg of his spacesuit. 

He continued to wear both his Seiko and his Omega at the same time - one set to his home time zone

Some people aren't clear on what a ""Pogue"" is or should be.  Pogue's watch was a 1971 Seiko 6139-6005, and non U.S. ones had slightly different dial text as a result.    

[Here's an actual photograph of the watch](http://i.imgur.com/SuHpkMd.jpg) after thirty-five years of continual use.  One thing that makes for some confusion is that the watch has a white indicator ring.  Some people used to think that Seiko produced a white ring as a result.  They never did.  These watches came with a yellow ring to match the dial, but to a greyish-white.  In every case where I've seen a white ring, when I've taken it out and flipped it over, it's still yellow underneath.  Ditto for the black - grey on top, black underneath.  

[This is my ""Pogue""](http://i.imgur.com/6IMW7R1.jpg) - it's a 6139-6005 ""Resist""

Anyway, know what you are looking for.  There are lots of watches out there that unscrupulous or unclear sellers will attach the label ""Pogue"" to.  Know your Pogues - accept no substitutes!",,False,,t5_2qls5,1366061317.0,,

I just started a new job/training/apprenticeship under a certified Master Watchmaker. I thought I'd tell you the story of how that happened, or simply just likes a good story about watches, clocks and their making. 

First of all, watchmaking, is merely something that is extremely interesting to me, and something that I may want to pursue in the future. 

Anyways

Basically, price ranges are anywhere from $400 - $1,000). He was at the past Basel World Fair, which of course, peaked my interests (this was at a time when I was still in school — about ~1,500 Km away) but couldn't really meet with him or anything like that. Long story short, I mentioned to my parents my keen interest in watches and watchmaking and he told them that I should contact a friend of his, as soon as I arrived home

Well, for me to practice until I've graduated and can do something with him full time. 

Yesterday was my first *real* day (I went into his workshop for an interview prior to that), wheel cutters, CNC machines, etc. Then he took me to my very own watchmaker's bench, from Bulova (he worked there for a while and has accumulated lots of equipment from them and others), complete with some very basic and elementary tools. He has said that, the farther along and more skilled I get

He has also gotten me some reading material: a book on practical clockmaking (where we start, 21, that he attempted to build a Daniels Tourbillon, but didn't get into to much detail).

The only real ""work"" that I had to do that day was somewhat of a test. ""Throwing me to the wolves"" as he called it (remember I have no formal training whatsoever). He quickly took apart a clock movement in front of me, which he would inspect). After I finished cleaning them, ultrasonically and by hand, as well as dried them, he inspected the plates and said that they were good (which made me happy!). Now, keep in mind that I have no formal training, he has never taught anybody without formal training before and so this is all kind of new to him as well. 

As a final ""test"" for the day, ""I'll be back in a few minutes, try putting it back together. I know this is Greek to you, but I'd like to see where your hand-eye skills are at — so just give me a shout when you're done, or too frustrated to continue!"" 

I had never touched a clock movement before (or a watch movement) but have dreamed about it for a long time, chime and strike) and put the cover plate on. He came by to inspect, and it worked! I felt great, and even better when he said ""you've impressed the shit out of me!"" A fantastic start...

Then he asked me to disassemble and reassemble again

That pretty much sums up my first day

P.S. Here is the assembled [clock movement](http://imgur.com/2bgUZ).

*Story time*
Was looking for a new watch and had a hard time making a decision on it. Top choices were Nomos Tangente Sport Datum, JLC Ultrathin 38mm manual, and JLC Reverso Ultrathin.

In the end, so it came down to the used Speedy at 2k or a new Tangente Sport Datum at 2.7k. Called watchbuys and the guy there basically convinced me to not buy it. He said that it wasn't what they were known for, it didn't fit with the bauhaus design that they have going as a company, and that the resell value wouldn't be as great.

Thought about it for a while after that... the Speedy looks great... but a couple of things pushed me back to Nomos. First, and very little money spent on marketing? Yes, please. Second, the Speedy Pro is a collector's classic (for good reason), and the hipster in me wants something a little out of the norm.

So, the bezel is thinner, and it is pretty much their flagship model.

*Thoughts on the Nomos Tangente Datum*

I flipped two Seiko 5s before finding a watch worth keeping in my Maratac Pilot. After that one thing led to another and I'm currently at 6 automatics. My tastes have changed several times since the beginning with watches going on and off what you would call the ""short"" and ""long"" lists. However I feel that I can say with a fair amount of certainty that the watches I own currently are long term keepers.

*I knew I had caught the fever when I bought this one. My decision was largely influenced by a very [well written article](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/depth-review-orient-star-wz0211el-white-dial-somes-lots-pics-848494.html) on WUS. The styling seemed very unique to me and I had been becoming intrigued with cushion cases in general. It seemed dressy and manly at the same time. The strap on this piece seals the deal too. The bridle leather is simply unmatched when compared to any other leather I’ve touched. It is thick but flexible and has the most intoxicating aroma. My gf simply doesn’t “get” this one but I love wearing it around. I have a feeling this won’t be my only dip into the JDM pond.*

*This piece pretty much fell out of the sky and into my lap. It caught my eye early on in my WUS days in WRUW threads. However I quickly pieced together that it had been made in a limited quantity of 150 two years earlier and popped up for sale so infrequently that it was dubbed a “unicorn”. Then one day some forum member casually mentioned in a thread that he was considering moving his along so I messaged him. As it turns out by chance I saw his post within a minute of it going up and was the first to inquire. He was nice enough to give me priority on it. I like having a moonphase complication. Some liken it to wearing like a pick because of it's small diameter while being quite thick due to the added complications. I like how it wears though and it solicits A LOT of compliments. My gf actually says she likes this better than the C60 she purchased for me or any other watch I own for that matter.*

*This watch started out as an espresso maker...let me explain. My gf who listens quite well got me an espresso maker for Valentine’s day as I had going on about wanting one. Within a month it failed despite positives reviews...so back it went and replaced with a different brand with still positive reviews. That one broke within a day. At that point we were both fed up with espresso makers and she mentioned “that brass watch you were looking at”. I lamented to her that it was sold out and I had missed my chance. However I took a shot in the dark by emailing the company and sure enough they were still sitting on 3 Layans. It is essentially the same case as the bronze Magrette and from my understanding most likely made in the same mold. I like the uniqueness of this piece

*My most recent acquisition and something I had looked at on and off. With the recent 15% off sale at ChrWard I decided to take the plunge. One of my issues with enjoying divers is that a lot of them look quite similar and I try to stick to variety in my collection when possible (sensible). The C11 Makaira is different from my C60 is many ways: square case, and a completely different dial aesthetic. It’s much less “dressy” than the C60 and I like how sporty it looks. This piece really let me put ChrWard’s claims about unmatched customer service to test though. I received mine and was very excited until I realized some specs had made it under the crystal during assembly. I took some photos and sent them off to customer service. They were very apologetic and asked me to ship it back at their expense. On top of that they shipped my replacement with expedited shipping the moment I sent her the tracking number for my return watch. Haven’t encountered many companies that will replace an item before they have even received the faulty one. My replacement is due to be here Monday and I have an Isofrane with RS buckle ready to put on it.*

What does the future hold? I'm not really sure right now. I've already paid for the WUS Chinese forum watch this year which is a ST5 movement project and will be buying the Affordables forum watch which is being produced my Bernhardt's Fred Amos. If I saw a Citizen Orca pop up for sale I don't know if I could pass and I've been considering picking up a Rodina on mesh.

Here are the watches I've ""flipped"" due to not bonding with them:

A few months ago my GF and I decided to get engaged (no

I visited the Tag Heuer and Omega boutiques in the mall and tried a few watches on, little did I know! Just by chance I clicked on the black dial model (which was released in 2012) and liked it straight away. It was immediately placed on my short list. 

The decision was cemented when my GF came to stay with me (LDR) and we both visited the Zenith boutique to try it on.

Zenith was Founded in 1865 in Le Locle, which although first released in 1969, is still made, in house, to this day! 

The El Primero (Spanish for 'the first') movement was,000 VpH as opposed to the standard 18,000 or 28,800 VpH most other watches offered.

If you want to get a better feel of the difference in speed go to http://advanced.bestmetronome.com,000 VpH, 480 for 28,800 VpH and 600 for 36,000 VpH.

The El Primero Story

In the 1970's

However, wrapped and labelled them, before hiding them away in the Zenith factory attic. He also copied the procedures to recreate the movement from scratch in his notebook. 

Several years later another Swiss company asked Zenith if they had any El Primero movements for sale. Zenith did and the resulting watch

You can see some fascinating pictures of the old factory and the attic where everything was kept here:

Some people don't like the overlapping sub dials but it doesn't bother me in the slightest.

The only thing I would have liked is to swap the small seconds and chronograph hands around. 

For a watch famous for it's 36, I know it wouldn't be a good idea to have the chronograph on a sub dial.

**Size**

At 40mm, but I generally prefer 44-46mm watches) but being as the dial is 99% of the actual face, [it looks bigger than it is](http://i.imgur.com/CKuodsV.jpg).

**The Band**

The watch comes with a very soft dark brown leather band.  It just so happened that the strap holes were spread just to the point where the band is either slightly too loose or slightly too tight.

One issue I have with the watch is the noise the rotor creates.  It's LOUD.  Like Parnis loud.  I was pretty surprised that the Miyota 9100 movement - while gorgeous and very accurate (maybe +6 seconds a day

That's that!  First watch I spent over $500 on, sporting ETA movement.  And the equally beautiful chrono is quite a bit cheaper, with Japanese quartz movement.

[Here's an album of the real thing](http://imgur.com/a/B4Wv1).  This example is special because it's entirely original, hands etc.  This watch has very little wear, and can be viewed as a type specimen of the model.  This is what good looks like when it comes to these.

This watch is not only rare, which is insane - the deepest recorded scuba dive was to 206 meters - one-third what this watch would do.  Any diver that went that deep wouldn't ever come up again.
The high-torque quartz movement is based on the robust 6309 - many of the parts are interchangeable.  

In its day this was a high-end piece, robust, durable.  Not many were made, and they were made only for a few years in the late 70s and early 80s.  The quartz bubble popped in the late 80s and early 90s, with ""quartz"" becoming equated with ""cheap"", which can be true.  Once the technology was figured out, it was simple to crank out millions of cheap quartz watches.  But this huge production clouded the early days of the high-end quartz movements - serious timepieces, or the concurrent production of the 6105 and 6309 divers.   But they're coming into their own

These watches aren't for everyone - the black &amp; gold combination is unique, and at only 116 grams they're lighter than they look.  Very comfortable.",,False,,t5_2qls5,1365904110.0,,

Big Date-
Breguet Caliber 517gg
Engine-turned dial in silvered
Chapter ring with BREGUET roman numerals and luminous minute-markers
Large date at 6 o'clock
Luminous BREGUET facetted open-tipped hands in 18-carat gold
Engine-turned caseback with sapphire crystal
Screw-locked crown
Water-resistant to 100m
Power reserve: 65 hours
Diameter: 39mm

XXI-

Luminous hands and numbers
Case thickness (mm)- 17.30
Case dimension (mm)- 44.00
Jewels- 28
Water (m)- 100
Powers (hours)- 45

Both were gifts from relatives several years apart. I love them both. I'm more of a casual person so its actually a little awkward to wear them frequently but I try. I'm considering changing the strap on the XXI to the black one featured on the titanium edition. Brown/rose gold is a little too much. Anyway

**Presentation**

The box for this watch is very modern and sleek looking. The matte black coating shows fingerprints very easily though. Also, because when the watch shipped to me, it had kind of fallen sideways inside the box and the case was scraping against the little metal border around the indentation where the watch sits. The watch was steel, so it's fine though.

[box 2](http://i.imgur.com/5iyH5uW.jpg)

[box open](http://i.imgur.com/n68HStz.jpg)


**Case**

The watch is 40mm, they are set in a case that is actually kind of tonneau shaped (i.e. rectangle with rounded sides) if you look straight down on it, and (3) the integrated lugs extend out pretty far. 

It has a lot of different edges and layers that are polished to different textures

[crown detail

[just gorgeous](http://imgur.com/o8omacE)

**Dial**

The dial is matte black. There is an outer chapter ring with minute indicators. Inside that, there is a circle engraved onto the dial. THe hands are wide, straight sword-style. One thing I love about this watch is how supremely legible it is. The minute indicators are widely spaced, making it easy to read time down to the second. Also, the hour indicators are kind of beveled and faceted, so they catch the light and glint in a very pleasing way.

**Lume** 

This is one area where I feel the watch is a bit lacking. When I first got the watch, the tiny little slice of lume next to the date window. The third picture in the album is the most accurate version of how the lume actually looks.

[Lume album](http://imgur.com/a/Eom22)

**Bracelet**

The bracelet is amazing. Unavoidably, and the scratches don't show very much on the brushed steel. The edges of the bracelet links and the center links are beveled and polished, so when the light hits it, [the outline of the links kind of glimmers](http://i.imgur.com/yz0giF2.jpg). The craziest thing about the bracelet is the high-tech way the links work. Each link has a little circle on it. (see below). The circles are actually buttons that must be held down with a pusher before the pins can be slid out from the side with another pusher. So that is pretty high tech. The downside of this is that there's no way to change the links without scratching the little buttons with the pusher tools. But it's also kind of cool, because the scratched buttons signify the bracelet sized for my wrist only.

Started my journey today into beautiful watches with this bumper automate 1953 stainless steel Omega. Kept on returning to it and finally decided to purchase it. 

It appealed to me with its 'no fuzz' elegant look. Here's a photo of it

* Edit: I found this in auction in Finland. The clock history is the dial has been restored in Ohio in 2008

The movement has 17 jewels with F=19 800A/h,8mm. I'll snap some more pics as i get the kidzillas sleeping. 

The strap is 18mm brown lizard leather with Omega marking in the strap and the buckle.

Pros:  legible, and especially to the chrono reset.  A very solid ""snap"" that I'd normally associate with a non-quartz chrono.  The design is intuitive and functional.  The lume glows a surprising light blue - I'm used to the Seiko green.

Cons: it's just slightly too blingy for me - I wish it were more stripped-down and functional, I'm stuck with how it was made.  I also wish that the case diameter was slightly smaller - my sweet spot is between 40-42mm.

I see a lot of watch pictures here

Photography gear has come a long

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/sGtwTK9.jpg) is a high-res photo I just took

1. **Get a real camera**. You don't need a fancy SLR, and if you don't already own a camera, these are great to have when you're on vacation, visiting the beach or just doing anything memorable. Honestly, these cheap little point &amp; shoot cameras can be better for watch photography than a more expensive DSLR with a kit lens, because the smaller cameras tend to have a smaller minimum focus distance so you can get your camera really close to your watch to capture all that detail. (Edit: [Examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1fneu8/watch_photography_guide_taking_better_watch/cac7rgc) showing why using a real camera is better than using a phone.)

2. **Use a tripod**. You don't need an $800 carbon fibre Gitzo

3. **Think about your lighting**. Lots of ambient light is good. On a sunny day, or a desk lamp, is harder to work with. If you want to put more effort into it, you can use a light box. It's not hard or expensive if you want to [build your own](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Inexpensive-Photography-Lightbox).

4. **Don't hold the watch in your hand**.  [Your hand is unsteady](http://i.imgur.com/F9uzaHm.jpg), you can rest your arm on something steady, like a desk or a table.

5. **Make sure you do steps 1-4**. They are absolutely the most import things. Use a camera. Use a tripod. Use good lighting. Don't hold the watch in your hand.

6. **Clean your watch**. Before you take your photo, and most of the dust &amp; lint that you'll be able to see now that you're taking a decent photo of your watch.

7. **Set your camera's output**. Make sure your camera is set to give you the biggest most detailed pictures. With my camera

8. **Set your camera's ISO**. Put it on the lowest possible setting. Usually somewhere around ISO 100. ISO is a measure of how sensitive your camera is. The more sensitive it is

9. **If your camera/lens has an anti-shake feature

10. **Set your aperture**. If you have a fancy enthusiast/DSLR camera

11. **Set the focal length (zoom)**. If you have a zoom lens, it's somewhere in the middle of the range. You'll have to experiment. My camera is sharpest at its widest setting. Often, the minimum focus distance is much better the wider you set your lens, so shooting in your widest focal length is the best way to capture the most detail.  Position your watch in the center of your camera's field of view. Camera lenses are designed to be the sharpest at their center. Fill the frame as much as possible that allows your camera to still focus on it, to get the most detail out of your watch. If you don't fill the frame like in [this photo](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/NikonD70/Samples/QualityRes/DSC_0002.jpg), you can make more creative photos, but you will sacrifice detail on your watch. (For comparison, [my photo](http://i.imgur.com/sGtwTK9.jpg) was taken with a   nearly 3 year old compact camera. You can see how far the technology has come.)

12. **Turn on macro mode** if your camera has it. This allows your camera to focus on very close-up objects.

13. **Set up your scene, wear pants. More than one eBay photographer has been caught in their underwear in a reflection on their watch. Seriously. **Wear pants**. Edit: If you have a polarizing filter for your camera, this can also be helpful in reducing reflections.

14. **Set the white balance on your photo**. If your photo is lit mostly by incandescent light

15. **Use the timer function on your camera** to take a picture. Set it to something like 2 seconds. When you press the shutter button

16. **That's it!** You've taken a nice picture. If you want to go the extra mile, or if you upload your photos to [Google+](https://plus.google.com) there are some excellent easy-to-use tools to improve your pictures. (By adjusting the contrast, resizing &amp; cropping, correcting for lens distortion, playing with the colour temperature, etc.) Edit: Someone on /r/Watches was [showing me their favourite watch photo](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1hf2d3/wrist_check_the_official_thread_for_monday_july_1/cau7vdy) and I was showing them how you can improve a photo in post. [[Before](http://i.imgur.com/fmPSTqi.jpg)] [[After](http://i.imgur.com/sI4x7EL.jpg)]

Hope someone finds this helpful :)

So after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19lynp/casio_gshock_gw3000bb_my_thoughts_after_a_few/) thread, so ended up having to import it from Italy (it arrived yesterday).

Full technical specs are available [here](http://www.gshock.com/watches/Aviation/GW4000D-1A). They key features for me are the radio controlled time update

My first impressions are that the watch is very high quality (as to be expected from the Aviator range). The watch is very comfortable to wear and very easy to read. The lume is also pretty good. I really love the retrograde style weekday indicator as well as the 24 hour dial. The stopwatch is only 24 minutes

I'm still not 100% convinced with the metal bracelet and am considering buying a replacement resin strap.

The pictures don't really do the watch justice. The dial is slightly translucent, the watch wears nicely on my 7"" wrist - although it is a big watch, it doesn't feel silly (this is probably helped by the flatter profile).

I picked up the watch from him last night in person and true to his word the watch was in excellent condition.

Description:

This suggestion exists mostly to illustrate to the reader that there are some tremendously good deals if you're willing to consider vintage watches.

The linked example is a LeCoultre Memovox, the Memovox is somewhat of a signature complication for the highly heralded brand, Jaeger-LeCoultre.

A classic watch with its own personality, for an excellent price.

Unlike a new/modern watch

Generally, shock protection wasn't as common a feature on wrist watches. (It should be noted, though, the above linked watch does not have shock protection.)

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced

*****

If you are considering a mechanical watch, you will be lucky if it is worth half of what you paid in 5 years. You should consider the total cost of ownership when choosing your watch.

*****
Remember

If you disagree with someone, so people can read different opinions to get different ideas and perspectives on how people view these watches. Downvoting without giving a counter-perspective is not helpful to anybody, and will earn you super looks of disapproval from everyone else. ಠ_ಠ

Well I have been lusting after this watch for a while now


I don't think she had planned on giving it to me as usually she is adamently opposed to early gifts. However my Orient Star Somes I received Saturday from Seiya was having issues and had to be shipped back to Japan today to be checked out. As it turns out the C60 arrived in the mail today

The watch is even better in person. The blue is beautiful and changes with lighting. The textured dial is flawless and overall ChrWard's attention to detail is superb. The signed crown is nice and screws down very smooth. The leather strap is high quality and the deployant works flawlessly (also easy to adjust). I will probably order the bracelet in the near future for some versatility and I have been told their bracelets are well made. One nice thing about ChrWard is that you don't get gouged on the straps/bracelets. So it really doesn't matter which you order with the watch if you want both because the costs ends up the same.

This watch has already become my favorite in just a few short hours.

1362733486.0,19wjql,"After months of careful consideration, got my new Tangente Datum",ziller,83,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19wjql/after_months_of_careful_consideration_got_my_new/

Last week I (finally) bought a Nomos Tangente Datum at their [Zürich flagship store](http://www.nomos-schweiz.ch/en/). I actually originally went there just to compare sizes (Tangente vs Tangente Datum vs Tangente Datum Gangreserve), managed to convince me at the store that I need to buy it right on the spot. Apparently I'd otherwise just be obsessing over it for yet another month. The sales person didn't oppose the idea and the price was exactly the same as in [the Nomos online store](http://www.nomos-store.com/en/Watches/Tangente/Watches-with-manual-winding/Tangente-Datum-sapphire-crystal-back.html), so I thought ""why not"".

I deliberately went for a handwound watch. And I was planning to get it as my daily beater, instead. But the dial on that one looked slightly disproportionate; the date window was shorter than the numerals, the small seconds sub-dial was too small and the Nomos logo was offset oddly. So I went for the bigger one, just for the cleaner looks alone. I'm still not 100% sure that it's not too big for my wrist, but I think I can live with it.

My first impressions after purchasing it: *it's so thin*! And comfortable! My previous daily wearer was a Tissot automatic and I had slowly started to get properly annoyed at its size (11mm thick) and the weight (you could actually feel it weighing your wrist down). The Nomos, lightweight, yet solid and sturdy. Just a pleasure to wear. The leather band is amazing too. I went for the brown one instead of the default black, which felt a bit too formal for my taste.

The (in-house) movement is beautifully finished and so far every bit as accurate as expected: on average +1.5 sec/day

Can't find anything negative to say about it. Even winding it is a pleasure. Definitely worth every penny I invested in it.",,t5_2qls5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19wjql/after_months_of_careful_consideration_got_my_new/

I recently ran a giveaway on [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice) - now it's time for [/r/watches](/r/watches) turn.

I'm giving away 5 nato straps from my company ([www.straply.me](http://www.straply.me)) to the members of this subreddit - first things first



company background follows : 
I recently was in the [market for NATO straps](http://i.imgur.com/b23fI.jpg) and was disappointed with the shopping experience. They were either overpriced (15-30$, at [www.straply.me](http://www.straply.me). I spent a month or so buying, researching, and contacting suppliers and have found one that manufactures to a standard I'm happy with. Our straps are sturdy, woven nylon with adjustment holes that are punched and sealed in two steps instead of just one to prevent any fraying, and finished with 316L surgical grade stainless steel hardware. They're $10 each and right now I'll do free shipping if you buy two.

If you're impatient or unlucky

Good Luck!

- When I was in jr high, the bezel would often pop off and the metal on the underside of the pushers completely corroded away.
http://imgur.com/RqaeNhQ    



- My next watch was a titanium fossil chronograph. The clasp on the bracelet broke after just a few months. Picture from the web
http://imgur.com/58blvxA    



- Next was a citizen skyhawk titanium. This was my first solar and I wore it for years without any issues. Very well built watch. Image from web
http://imgur.com/XWgqtll    



---This is when I discovered WUS---    



- First up is a luminox. I had discovered wus but I still hadn't discovered manual wind and automatic watches yet. This watch took a beating and just kept going. No complaints 
http://imgur.com/1cShOG8    



- I really loved the tritium vials of the luminox and graduated to a Marathon TSAR. This was a huge jump in quality from all the watches I had previously owned. The TSAR is unbelievably solid and tough.
http://imgur.com/JyGiHV2    



- Next is the fortis pilot professional. I absolutely love this watch but eventually sold it because it was a little small for me. If fortis made this watch 42-44mm I would buy it in a heartbeat. 
http://imgur.com/dGTGfXb    



- Stowa marine original. Absolutely gorgeous with a beautifully decorated movement. 
http://imgur.com/3dIwm1b    



- Suunto core for heavy outdoor use. Great ABC features. Sunrise and sunset times were handy for going out and taking pictures. I had an issue with the battery life and sent the watch back to suunto. They fedex'ed me a brand new watch free of charge...great service.
http://imgur.com/Ae0bo4q    



- I went through a panerai phase but couldn't bring myself to spend the money on one. I got 2 ""homages"" from JOA but ended up never wearing them because I didn't feel comfortable with it. Living in so cal I see panerai's semi regularly. I didn't want someone to get the impression that I was wearing a fake. 
http://imgur.com/uwO3voA    


- One that I really regret seling. A Laco WUS project watch.
http://imgur.com/Xt6gwVe    


- My first real ""luxury"" watch...omega po 45mm. This watch was worth every penny. Absolutely wonderful to wear. It was on the omega bracelet normally and on the omega rubber while in the water. 
http://imgur.com/JxxTyHj    



- Luminox blackout. I didn't keep this one long but am still a fan of the all black look. Wore it on a black zulu with low light hardware. 
http://imgur.com/NB7F551    



- I sold my suunto core to get the casio paw 1500yj. No complaints with the suunto but I need to see the seconds on the main screen for my work. This is one of the 3 watches I have in my current collection. I'll keep it until it dies. Tough watch with great abc features as well as atomic syncing. 
http://imgur.com/t32o0wm    



- Disney Micky Mouse quartz. Gift from a friend who is now my gf. It doesn't get much wrist time but it has great sentimental value. 
http://imgur.com/CkdgdUP    



- My precious. The Longines Legend Diver no date. I have been in love with this watch since the first time I saw it on wus. I finally bought myself one for my birthday this year. I wear it on a black brady strap with rhd deployant clasp or if I'm doing something that requires something more rugged

First off, I don't think r/watches as a whole is for watch snobs. I believe the people on here just value quality (at any price point) over fashion. Which is why Seiko/Citizen/Orient are usually just as well received as Rolex/Omega/Tag Heuer. Just because your watch got downvoted to hell, doesn't make everyone else a snob.

Second, features etc. But that being said, there's no need to go out of your way to be a dick. I personally hate NATO straps, a lot of y'all love them and that's fine. But if I see a post that says NATO in the title, I simply move on. There's really no need to go start a war with the NATO fans. Same thing can apply to different watch brands. There's a difference between having an honest disagreement and commenting on someone's post just to tell them their watch is shit. Which brings me to my third point.

Third, and that's ok. You can't get your feelings hurt and be mad because not everyone who comments has something nice to say. This is after all the internet. No one forced you to post anything, you did that all on your own. And especially if you just post a pic of your watch and say ""what does r/watches think?"" without even bothering to do a write up of the watch and give us some more info. If you do that, you really do invite all of r/watches to say whatever they want about your piece. Even if I don't like the watch, I can at least appreciate the people who take the time to do a proper post and tell us their story, tell us about the watch etc.

These are just some of my opinions and observations. I'd love to hear r/watches thoughts about this subreddit and their opinions on etiquette

i bought the watch off ebay for $150

the seller was not a professional so i thought the watch was simply old and would run again after a service. the other factor why i bought the watch is because it has a steel case with a simple geometry

and i was right, and around -2/2 spd.

it was a very good buy

the case was pretty scratched and it took more than a polishing

the crystal has a big chunk missing aswell

here are some befor/after pics:

i can post more pics showing the process if you are interested. 

i only wear it as my dresswatch so it does not get a lot of wristtime

I would and probably will at some point go to great length to get it repaired and cleaned. But till now it runs like a charm :-)

First, we're going to be keeping a bot, but not AutoModerator - /u/gleam has scripted /u/WatchesBot for us, which will handle things from now on. This brings me to the next issue - the infamous bracket rule. Reaction to this one was a bit more mixed. We looked into other ways of doing things, but one suggestion in the thread seemed like a good compromise for us to try - keeping brackets, but making them uniformly at the beginning of post titles only. Hopefully this will cut down on some of the visual noise that people didn't like, but we'll see what people think.

Lastly, in both the comments and the survey. That too had very close results, and seemed to be the one that people were the most passionate about. I will reiterate here that me and most of the mods felt that there was a big improvement to post quality thanks to self-posts-only, and we weren't the only ones that felt that way. Nonetheless, we're going to bring back link posts, on the condition that people still do provide a write-up of some sort, as was required with self-posts, and once it finds a comment from the OP, please just message the mods and we'll approve it forthwith.

I commonly see the Steinhart Ocean 1 referred to as a Rolex Submariner ""homage.""
Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/z7d4k/smallernormal_sized_rolex_sub_homage_with/
Watch: http://www.steinhartwatches.de/en/OCEAN-1-BLACK

While the Invicta Pro Diver is often referred to as a ""knockoff"" of the Rolex Submariner. ""Knockoff"" having a much more negative connotation than ""homage.""
Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/19knzu/what_do_you_think_about_this_watch_invicta_pro/ 
Watch: http://www.amazon.com/Invicta-Diver-Collection-Automatic-Watch/dp/B0006AAS4M

Now I fully understand the difference in quality of the two watch brands (Invicta of inconsistent/low quality

What irks me is that some members of the watch community scoff at Invicta for copying Rolex

On a basic level, why refer to them differently? Is it simply personal bias of the user?

I would appreciate it if someone could shed some light on this distinction.

**If asking for a watch recommendation

- Give us some idea of what the recipient will want it for (work, everything in general, etc).

- What's the recipient's wrist size? If you don't know the recipient's wrist size

- Your budget

- Take a look through the [Buying Guide](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches#TherWatchesOfficialBuyingGuide) at your preferred price point and let us know what catches your eye and what you do and don't like about it.

- Are there any other special criteria you'd like it to meet? Common ones include specific brands, or movement types. See the rest of the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/watches) if you'd like some more ideas.

**If giving purchasing advice:**

- Listen to what the watch purchaser wants, quartz is probably a more appropriate choice than a mechanical watch for most people.

- Be nice. There will be a lot of first-time watch buyers here, or market trends. Just because you hate a brand or model does not give you permission to flame someone for asking about it.

- In a similar vein to the previous point, people are coming to us for advice, and giving them more information to make an informed decision is the purpose of this exercise. Simply flaming or downvote-bombing someone else for suggesting a watch you don't like is not productive.

I know a majority of this community is not a huge fan of buying advice threads, please don't flame the threads. Just ignore them and enjoy the rest of the content here - in a few weeks things will be back to normal (after the wave of ""Look what I got for Christmas!"" posts, of course).

As always, an awesome group of people. This is a hectic time of year; please stay courteous to each other and to new users.

[Breitling Superocean Heritage](http://i.imgur.com/cIJ8L58.jpg?1)

A quick backstory: both of these belonged to my dad. He passed away and I inherited them. 

I really like the Breitling, so much so that when I switch to the Rolex I am constantly checking to make sure the watch is still on my wrist. I am not the biggest Breitling fan in general, but this one obviously has a lot of sentimental value to me. I get more compliments on it than I do the Rolex, but I attribute that to the size. 

As much as I like the Breitling, I find it hard switching back to the Breitling, I'd really rather wear the Rolex. As I said, I get more compliments on the Breitling than on the Rolex, and I prefer the ""under the radar"" aspect of the Rolex as compared to the Breitling - unless someone is into watches, chances are the Rolex goes unnoticed. I also love the versatility of the watch - I can easily dress it up and wear a suit with it, or I can dress it down and beat the hell out of it while swimming, etc.

""Seiko 5"" is a little piece of marketing flair that Seiko has used since the 60s on watches from basic dress watches, to sport divers.  

For a poster to hate on ""Seiko 5"" is to demonstrate that the poster doesn't understand Seiko.  While this flair can mean a low-end watch

Finally

1. Diaflex (unbreakable mainspring)
2. Diashock (Seiko's shock resistant design
3. Automatic winding
4. day/date indication
5. Water resistant. 

it's a mark of Seiko's quality, then they should make sure to take the time to understand what they are sneering at.

1) **Citizen BM7193-07** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/Dqh032eh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Mens-BM7193-07B-Eco-Drive-Watch/dp/B00843L74S/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375589236&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=rose+gold+citizen+eco+drive) | Price: $170 | Overall: 7/10 | This watch is an absolutely beautiful dress watch. As an Eco-Drive, it is too dressy to get much wear time, and if I were to want it for a formal occasion I would surely have enough time to set it since prep for formal events takes a while anyways. So while it is great, it may have been a bit too dressy for my needs, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a dress watch (mineral crystal seems fine for dress watches, assuming you don't go crazy at formal events).

2) **Green Orient World Time** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/IsWHzHHh.jpg) | ~~Buy Link~~ | Price: ~$75 | Overall: 6/10 |
This one is a recent addition, but it keeps time well and what else can you ask for? I don't have much to say about it, since I haven't had enough time yet to really evaluate it.

3) **2013 Maratac Mid Pilot** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/jWlt0tdh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.countycomm.com/midpilot2013.html) | Price: ~$325 | Overall: 9/10 | This watch was pretty expensive, and is only noticeable if it is very quiet and you're trying to hear it. It feels larger than it is for just a 39mm watch, but that's what Maratac is known for. I bought it at $239, but with shipping and taxes in California it ended up around $280, and at that price point I would say it is worth it, but you're not getting any sort of spectacular deal. It gets worn fairly often, and gets a good amount of complements. 

4) **Citizen Stiletto** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/Ajrznbqh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-AR1120-50E-Stiletto-Drive-Watch/dp/B0050SB6BE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375590253&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=citizen+stilleto) | Price: $320 | Overall: 9/10 | This watch is also fantastic, and the lack of a seconds hand is something I do enjoy. I find this one being worn often, and it also gets a good deal of complements.

5) **Christopher Ward C7 Rapide MK I** | [My awful picture](http://i.imgur.com/xVZXLach.jpg) | [new model Buy Link](http://www.christopherward-usa.com/men/sport/c7mk2.html) | Price: $230 | Overall: 9/10 | I bought this one when Chris Ward was having their summer sale to clear their old inventory, and the papers it came with helped back this up. It looks stunning in person, and I'm looking forward to wearing it often in the future since it just came in. It may be slightly larger than my usual, but it isn't a problem.

6) **Rodina Small Seconds** | [My picture](http://i.imgur.com/bXMPcGSh.jpg) | [Buy Link](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f71/affordable-nomos-homage-review-rodina-small-seconds-pictures-752788.html) | Price: $120 | Overall: 8/10 | The Rodina is exactly what it looks like, display back, and automatic movement make it a great deal. I'm also glad they at least put their own name on it &amp; took possession of it instead of doing an actual replica. However, it is a Chinese watch with iffy quality control, and mine is no exception. There are a couple specks on the dial that came on it, and I cannot remove them without getting inside, which is not something I can do. I'm sure I can go get this cleaned at my local shop for a bit, I felt the iffy quality control was worth mentioning. That being said,,False

Description:

This suggestion exists mostly to illustrate to the reader that there are some very interesting watches if you're willing to consider used or vintage watches.

In this price class, chronometer-grade timekeeping in a wristwatch, and developing the first modern waterproof watch. The Datejust represents all of these innovations, all in an elegant and understated, but iconic package.

The linked example is a Rolex Datejust 16030 with a cal. 3035 quickset movement. This Datejust is an excellent example of the timeless nature of Rolex design - its contemporary looks are virtually identical to the Datejust when it was introduced in 1945

Unlike a new/modern watch

Generally, shock protection wasn't as common a feature on wrist watches.

I recommend either purchasing a watch that has been recently serviced

*****

If you are considering a mechanical watch, you will be lucky if it is worth half of what you paid in 5 years. You should consider the total cost of ownership when choosing your watch.

Link to album: http://imgur.com/a/qRWVZ

1. Dial/Bezel:
Simple, this looks classier than the big bold vertical stripes on the previous aquaracer model. I also like the sweeping arrow second hand and the simple hour markers. The date window is conservative and easy to read, without a cyclops. It has good lume, enough to be able to tell time accurately in darkness.
The ceramic bezel is one of the easiest I've operated on a diver and yet very firm. the clicks are audible and I counted 120 clicks in one rotation. The surfaces are quite smooth and will not get caught in a jacket/shirt easily. There is absolutely no play when adjusting it. I can get it to align to the 12 hour marker perfectly. I'm OCD about it and I hate it when the bezel does not align proplerly


2. Case/Caseback/Bracelet:
The case itself is solid steel and well built. It's heavy and has good wrist presence. The watch does wear slightly larger than a normal 41mm watch. 
It does not have a display caseback
The bracelet looks like its 316L stainless steel. It's well built and quite heavy. The clasp is a fold-over with a button release. At this price point


2. Movement:
From what I can gather,800 bph. It's a fairly standard movement, so I haven't spent much time on figuring it out. I got +4 secs and +3 secs in the 2 days I've had it.

Overall:

At the ~$1600 price point, the design and the build quality won me over. Only time will tell how well it functions, but right now, I think I've added a good piece to my collection.",,False,,1364354297.0,t3_1b37dn

He then told us that that same wind going back would give is a huge boost and according to his computer made the journey only four hours and twenty minutes. Faster than he's ever made the trip.

This is part seven in our ongoing community project to compile opinions on the many watch brands out there into a single list. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/jnzih/introducing_the_rwatches_brand_guide/) is the original post explaining the project.

You good people asked for more higher-end brands last week, but I like to hear myself talk, so you're going to get one anyway:

Widely renowned as the finest watch manufacturer in the world, leaving them the last truly independent major brand at the top of the horological world. Though they do offer two collections of [sport watches](http://www.patek.com/html/en/discover_men_nautilus.html), Patek's bread and butter is their sleek, elegant, classic dress watches. Although their prices are astronomical (with their cheapest watches costing well over $10,000 new), the reputation and enduring quality of their watches make it worth it (though still quite unobtainable) to many watch enthusiasts

It was a [nice brass/bronze type finish](http://i.imgur.com/eu8fc.jpg) however I was more interested in the [dial and hands](http://i.imgur.com/TvZyI.jpg).

They originally got me a [TAG Heuer Formula 1 Grande Date](http://us.tagheuer.com/en/home#/en-luxury-watches-formula-1-grande-date42mm-black-steel-bracelet-wau1112-ba0858) from Tourneau, though

As I browsed, and it fell perfectly into my price range, with a bit left over. I couldn't not make the switch, and the Tourneau people were very accommodating about making the exchange, despite the fact that I didn't have an original receipt. **tl;dr - Got TAG, saw Ball, couldn't resist

Anyway

41mm (without crown)  
ETA 2836-2  
Sapphire crystal
50M Water resist  
Screw-in crown  
Tritium hour markers and hour

Please excuse my terrible photography; all I have is a point-and-shoot and no artistic skill whatsoever.

So, unadorned [ETA 2836-2](http://i.imgur.com/DPaj0kJ.jpg), which as I understand it is basically the venerable 2824-2 with a day module added on. I essentially paid $1300 for this, which is on the high side of reasonable, I think; list price is $1999, which is pretty steep. I don't think I would have purchased this new. That said, it's been keeping fantastic time in the two days since I obtained the watch, and I am looking forward to the ease of servicing down the line.

The [strap](http://i.imgur.com/iWMN2cy.jpg), but it's certainly OK. It's calf leather, and it's quite thick and soft. Naturally, the [buckle](http://i.imgur.com/jcYMBxh.jpg) is signed as well. I think I'm going to look into getting both some other straps (dark brown croc leather?) and an OEM bracelet down the line to mix things up some, though my wallet is cringing at the $300+ hit it's going to take from both of those. The current strap is more than sufficient for now, though, I think.

My wrists are approximately 7 inches, it doesn't really do so in person. I'm really into the aesthetics of the face. The white enamel dial is wonderful, and the ornate painted-on numerals are pretty neat. It makes for, in my opinion, a bit of a throwback style, which I like. The blued steel hands are just beautiful, and my [photos of the face](http://i.imgur.com/kEdfDsK.jpg) really don't do them justice. They change from a dark blue to a brighter, but there's still no substitute for seeing them in person.

Continuing on with the dial aesthetics, but I think it fits in with the overall feel of the watch. I'm still not sure how I feel about the '7' numeral, which is actually text reading ""Ball &amp; C"". It's a bit tacky, but at the same time, as I said, I like little details like that. Get back to me on this in a few weeks or a month or so. Also, the individually-labeled seconds and 24 hours could be a bit on the busy side, but so it goes.

Lastly, I couldn't capture a good picture of it, so I hope words will suffice. It's not as bright as Superluminova, at least not initially upon being put into the dark, but its sustain is much better - several hours later, it's still pretty bright and visible, whereas standard lume is often pretty faded by then. I've always wanted a tritium watch, I'm definitely a fan.

So, I think it's pretty reasonable. It's not really a dress watch, but more of a casual-dress one, if that makes sense - the type of thing I'd feel comfortable wearing to a desk job regularly, but not to anything fancy, really. Whatever. I'm gonna wear the thing everywhere for the foreseeable future. Fuck tha police.

Here's the full album of photos: http://imgur.com/a/iohQ9. For more (probably better) photos

Now for the promised small bonus: I mentioned earlier that there was some credit left over from the exchange of the TAG. We put that toward a new watch for my fiancee: a Luminox 7065 Colormark in pink. At 39mm it's pretty big on her wrists, as she tends to be accident prone.
