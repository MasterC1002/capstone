* 1995 - [Master P Returns to New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_P#1995.E2.80.932000:_Return_to_New_Orleans_and_mainstream_success)  This is historically significant as a starting off point because Master P was the first artist from the south (and as far as I know in hip hop) to independently go platinum.  The sound we know today hasn't started to quite evolve yet, and Geto Boys are starting to take the already developed west coast g-funk sound and turn it into something more unique and regionally based.

* 1997 - [Hot Boyz is founded and Cash Money Records receive $30 million deal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Money_Records) Most likely influenced and motivated by the success of fellow NO artist Master P

* 2000 - [DJ Screw passes away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dj_Screw) This opens the flood gates of the new sound, so the sound continues to gain notoriety with new crowds and develope/evolve.

* 2003 - Jay Z retires

* 2005 - [Young Jeezy and Mannie Fresh release And Then What](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XhOKIHGH7Q) This is the first time (that I recall at least) that the 808 descending pitch snare roll is used in a mainstream song.

* 2005-2007 The rise of Lil Wayne and Mixtape/Trap Culture.  This is the period of time Wayne took to releasing new material every week, Gucci Mane, and other similar artists with backgrounds in drug dealing (Jeezy was allegedly a member of the Black Mafia Family, and Gucci Mane beat a murder charge scott-free) began gaining popularity and working the term 'trap' (a drug house) into rap vernacular.  This established a musical genre for a culture/population (poor, southern, drug dealers) which somehow crossed over a lot into mainstream hip-hop and eventually kinda took over the rap game.

* 2008 - Dubstep happens in America.  I could talk about this at length but I'd prefer to just say this particular style of music got popular and changed a lot of perspectives on dance music.  Also it established the 140bpm set which is a lot easier to mix with 70-80 southern rap than the previously popular dancefloor go to, bringing the southern rap sound to a new audience.  For example, sometime in 2010(ish) I saw 12th Planet play an incredible set featuring tons of unreleased dubplates (Bass Canon being one of them) then end his set with the Ace Hood - Hustle Hard Remix (which also wasn't released at the time) and it went over phenomenally well with the crowd. 

* 2011 - [Post Dubstep/Future Garage arrives](http://www.liveforthefunk.com/spreads/post/unearthed-post-dubstep/)  This leads to what we now refer to as Future Garage, Hudson Mohawke releases the Satin Panthers EP, driving his normally 'Wonky' style beats towards a [more 'trap' oriented sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_6j2A630_Q)

* 2012 - This is where it gets kinda fuzzy.  Harlem Shake and Original Don (Flosstradamus Remix) both erupt as wildly popular songs, creating archives of songs available to share over the internet, making hour long all trap sets a possibility.

**ALBUMS**


-**Frozen EP**:


*Released February 28th
His very first release. A mixture of future-bass leaning music and crackling sample work, it reminds me occasionally of aquarium music. Then there are wobbles galore sneaking their way through the EP, as well as a drumstep record. Not entirely trap, but noteworthy for a general fan of the recent bass-music revival since 2009-2010. Favorite songs here are **Smacked** and **Oil!**.


-**Melodies


Released on December 5th
His second release far, definitely room for improvement, but still that same soul and confidence. Here his synth work is miles ahead of the bass work, but still doesn't feel uneven. The unusual percussion also comes into play, rounding out the songs. Probably listen to this one the least, but still has some great songs, with my favorite being **Headache**, off their first album. A song that induces its own title

-**Vibes


*Released on July 30th
His third release, a refix of a disco song by Treasure Fingers from 2008, and the amazing opener, **The Next Morning**, which spirals up out of nowhere and explodes around your brain. The synths sound like a trap-influenced Sonic The Hedgehog soundtrack outtake. His work with the bass frequencies has also far improved from his first album, as seen in the more well-known of his tracks on this album, **Roller**. There is also some amazing sampling done in **Free** and **Charms**. All in all, with all play-worthy tracks. 

-**Blu EP** :


*Released on November 21st
To be honest, but the construction of the songs is bland, and not even because the energy levels of the album are lower. He has plenty of downtempo tracks on other records that sound much better than here. Just doesn't do it for me. But never fear, because coming up, we have something amazing!

-**Bang


*Released on January 5th
Sit down, no cop-outs, no prisoners taken. Step by step, it annihilates the competition. **Bang** starts out distractedly quiet, and as you turn up the volume to hear it, the spiraling sample of Danny Brown's song ""Grown Up"" and the wobbling floor-shaking bass grab you by the fucking collar and pull you right up to the speakers. Next, **Fire (No Payroll)**, makes it progressive trap slide down the red carpet. **Drop (Get Silenced)** straight does not give a fuck, and remind me most of driving through a thunderstorm alone down a deserted highway. **Grind (Lex)** is also an amazing song, and you want a little rudeness. That is when **Pay (For What)** kicks in the door. I'm sure I don't have to introduce this song to anyone here

-**Life/Death EP** :


*Released on January 27th
If you're paying attention to these album releases, soul-exploding) album. That is an insane turnaround, and even with a simple 3 song set, it still manages to be an amazing creative effort. Favorite track is the first, **Death**, a fucking clinic in downward spiraling synths and drums, but still manages to show emotion and power. The rest of the EP flows well

-**Reality EP** :


*Released on March 5th
His most collaborative release so far, called **Beez**. My favorite track is probably **Cocaine, with Great Dane**, for the choppy vocal sample and the basswork. A great release, although not on the same level as Bang.

-**Mad Decent Release (Birth Control &amp; Hopscotch)**:


*Released on April 11th
He really out here now, so I'll just paste it in rather than try to be clever myself.
""Jeffrees presents two brand new tracks from Mr. Carmack

AND those are the albums! Of course, not all of them can fit in albums. Here are my favorite side-released or unreleased or lost-to-the-void-of-the-internet songs of his.

**SINGLES**


-**Goooo Kind Of**: An irritatingly-hard-to-find music file that is an amazingly skillful reimagining of TNGHT's song Goooo

-**Ego** (also known as 49ers): A swaggering bass monstrosity

-**Gibberish**: An amazing rainy-mood song

-**Say Yes or Say No**: Aaliyah flip, and treads that fine line between rainy mood and throwback R&amp;B styling. Amazing song.

-**ODB Shimmy Shimmy Ya Remix**: Y'all saw this a few weeks ago

-**Brazilian Blowjob**: His most viewed video, which seems to evoke the feel of the beach and boardwalk. 

-**Felt Nothing Today**: A swirling glitchy, but also brings out all of the feels.

There it is, if you can afford it, [buy his music](http://mrcarmack.bandcamp.com), because he definitely deserves it, and it is very reasonably priced! 

Sincerely (without sincerity)

If you are linking to one of your own songs, but if you cross over into 'hey I just made my first track and i think its pretty good and i played it for my friend and he said i should put it on here' your post will be removed.  We don't need your backstory in the title, if you wanna add anything put it in the description or comments.  Next,

No memes.

This is a newer one, so does our understanding of what this means.  The Harlem Shake videos:  First one, not technically a meme (yet), it was a video and I'm pretty sure I speak for all of us when I say, its 2013 and video on the internet is an excellent way to share ideas so we're not gonna ban videos.  This is a music board, and yeah we like to have fun, and no one wants a front page of straight soundcloud links to Baauer and Floss and Diplo etc, videos, fourth

Finally

Don't be a dick

2- There still exists DJ SkinnyWhiteDubstepGuy who thinks that tossing in a Lil John sample into his triplet 808's makes him tough. When you have to pay girls in hot pants to dance to your music

3- ""Bweep bloop bloopbloobpblob BWABWBABWBA ticktickticktickticktickticktick HMMM HMMM HMMMMM HERE'S YOUR ONE-LINER BWAAAAAAAAAAAP"" cannot be named the same genre as OJ Da Jucieman and Rick Ross. It's like saying Slipknot and The Beatles are the same because they both have guitars.

4- TNGHT, are some of the tightest producers in the game-- but they definitely shouldn't be considered trap anymore. I hate to get all sub-genre specific, but sometimes a line has to be drawn.

5- Bmore Club is way dope and,,False,self,t5_2qx81,False,,True

2) Every single trap show I have ever seen, though.

3) HE DIDN'T PLAY FRAZZLE OR SAWDUST. HEART BROKEN.

4) He did, as well as his alter ego songs he made as [Smiddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0yWelXwSfk). They went OFF live, I really appreciate the happy trap.

5) Slasherr was the biggest hit of the night with the crowd. Close second was when he played Backseat Freestyle

6) Played out R U READY

7) Had no idea who the opener was

8) Rustie is the only show I've ever seen that combined dubstep and trap successfully in the same set. Songs like Cry Flames and Globes were slid in and the crowd switched seamlessly from trap elbows to the deepest of wobbles. Great,,False,self,t5_2qx81,False,,True

I'm thinking about doing a Top Trap Comp in the future selecting the best tracks from all the previous compilations so let me know how you guys would feel about that. I'm up for a voting system or if you don't care as much Ill just go through and use my best judgment.

I have teamed up with /u/JXEYES to collect as much trap music as possible. For the past two weeks we have been filtering 15-20 GB of trap from the last 2 months and have picked out 400 of the best tracks for the compilation. We hope to continue doing this and now that its summer the wait between compilations wont be as long. If you want the raw data we may be able to work something out but its gonna be a while to upload 20 GB of music. Anyway

1370497671.0,1frwit,Why trap is not the new dubstep (Interested to hear your thoughts),quinnkyle,42,14,50,"*edit: I am completely aware of experimental dubstep artists such as james blake and burial

I hear the argument repeated a lot that trap is the ""new dubstep"" and like dubstep it will phase out like a trend(even though dubstep is not really dead but that is another argument)

1)Availability of variety in mainstream trap music production 

One of the things that lead to the ""fall"" of dubstep is that the lack of distinction in production and instrumentation. Literally every wobble and bass drop in mainstream dubstep sounds the same. Rarely is there a distinct melody to be heard

Although there were a variety of sounds in the dubstep scene which had its origins with artists like Coki,&amp; Mala whose sounds ranged from ambient to more agressive. Because it was such a new genre starting in mid 2000's when Skrillex cameout with his music and popularized the genre he completely changed the musical landscape of dubstep to the point where everyone had to mimic the ""bro-step"" sound to become popular.

""Trap"" beats are just really just hip hop beats formatted for a club scene which include bigger house inspired build ups and quicker transitions. Because there is so much variety which can be done to hip hop club beats there is much more room for creativity in the sound since hip hop club beats have been here since hip hop's conception in the 80's .

The tracks ""Yaow""-Baauer vs ""Goooo""-TNGHT vs ""Uppers""-Stooki Sound

Granted there is another side of trap music 

2)Origin of the genres

This is somewhat a continuation of the previously mentioned point, although again edm based trap music( as in edm producers who jumped on the trap trend) might be different sense it is marketed towards the edm crowd which is seemingly more committed towards electronic music trends as opposed to specific genres.

TL;DR: Two types of trap music ""edm based trap music"" which is mainly edm producers making trap music (which is more trendy and formulaic) vs hip hop edm based ""trap music"" (trap music based on hip hop party beats mainly coming from hip hop producers entering the edm scene which there has always been and will be a market for and has more variety and is less formulaic). The later will never fade

I have compiled all the best songs from TRAP COMP 1-5 and made one nice playlist that you can share with friends or just enjoy yourself (although it will all be duplicates if you have already downloaded 1-5). There are 250 songs in total so there is a wide variety from hard-hitting bangers, and a few Trap Muzik style songs. All of the music is available for free online so I wouldn't classify this as THE BEST of all trap music but it is all very good to listen to. Most of the very best songs you have to pay for so I cannot offer them to you. This does however include a few amateur producers that may not be seen on very many blog sites so that is the trade off you get.

Im kinda behind on my music but I should have TRAP COMP 6 ready in not too long. Ive loved watching this subreddit explode over the past few months and its great to see how involved everyone gets so keep up the good work.
