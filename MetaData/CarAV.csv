We have had some inquires as of late regarding redditors using r/CarAV to buy, we thought it best to keep commerce out of this subreddit and in its own. There are some fine examples which other subreddits have used very successfully.  /r/electronic_cigarette  and /r/ecigclassifieds work very well together to provide both a user community and a sales/trades front for users. They encourage commerce, but keep it separate from discussion. This is our goal: to keep the clean, informative and interesting posts flowing through /r/carav and allow a place for sales and trades. This will not only help keep CarAV content fresh, but free from ads that distract from its value. We do our best to keep spam at a minimum, so this is a great way to keep the spam filter properly trained while giving everyone the same rules - commerce will be encouraged at r/CarAVclassifieds from now on.

Without further ado, please feel free to subscribe, post, buy, and sell your new and used gear.

You are all encouraged to provide feedback, informative, and smoothly functioning places for Redditors.

Just wanted to show my car install that I've been messing with for some time now. My car install includes a USB DAC, DVB-T for FM stations and a Joycon for steering wheel controls. All of these are connected to 2 USB Hubs that are externally powered.


I have the webcam mounted for my backup cam but am having some problems with it in the daylight so I might ditch it if I can't figure out a solution.


As far as reliability I drove 9 hours back to college with no freezes or hiccups. Since I made my hub externally powered the tablet get enough power to stay fully charged over long trips while using gps and screen brightness on full

Oh and for GPS and wifi antenna I ended up mounting above the headliner on the passenger side and ran wires to the connectors.

**Damping Materials: name-brand product vs asphalt-based alternative**

&gt;When I started learning about damping resonances and sheet metal, and weather or not the presence of foil backing made a difference, or how thick it should be, and so on.

&gt;At the time, waves and whatnot.  As an extra credit project I ran an experiment to see how effective a single layer of asphalt-based roofing sealer (Grace Ice and Water Seal as commonly suggested during my reading) would be compared to a single layer of Stinger Roadkill (the first name-brand product I found at a local shop).  The results were astounding.

&gt;If you are interested in the specifics, find one with excellent adhesion, high temperature rating, a thin viscoelastic (usually butyl) layer, and a thick aluminum backing (ie. almost every name-brand product meets this).

*Image borrowed from E-A-R Specialty Composites -
http://www.earsc.com/pdfs/engineering/understandingdamping.pdf""]Understanding Damping

In this example

The experiment was simple: measure the damping factor of resonances of my car door as it came from the factory, I would test a single piece of sheet metal on the bench to see if there was a significant difference between trying to damp the resonances of my car door (a complicated system) vs a single sheet of steel (a simple system).

Damping factor is easy to visualize using an RTA and some division.  No complicated maths here.  [URL=""http://www.roush.com/Portals/1/Downloads/Articles/Insight.pdf""]Viscoelastic Damping 101

[I]A sample calculation: damping factor of 95hz resonant peak: η = (106hz - 82hz) / 95hz = 0.25
(a higher number is better)[/I]

[I]Above is test 1: this is what the outer door skin looked like from the factory.  Notice the single free-layer damping material that has been applied in the top-left corner.[/I]


[IMG]http://jzazzi.smugmug.com/photos/i-Nh8gzMX/0/M/i-Nh8gzMX-M.jpg[/IMG]
[I]Above is test 2: this is two layers of asphalt-based roofing applied over the top of the factory damping material.[/I]


[IMG]http://jzazzi.smugmug.com/photos/i-DQbC5ww/0/M/i-DQbC5ww-M.jpg[/IMG]
[I]Above is test 3: all asphalt and factory damping materials have been removed

After each treatment the doors were fully assembled before taking measurements.  Essentially I hammered the outside of the door using a soft mallet and recorded the sound from the inside, the second graph is from a single piece of sheet metal suspended in air, and tested the same way.

[IMG]http://jzazzi.smugmug.com/photos/i-JFj2Fpz/0/M/i-JFj2Fpz-M.jpg[/IMG]
[I]Above is damping factor of the car door untreated from the factory, and finally with additional Stinger Roadkill plus a layer of MLV for sound isolation.
(higher is better)[/I]


[IMG]http://jzazzi.smugmug.com/photos/i-tm84Scd/0/M/i-tm84Scd-M.jpg[/IMG]
[I]Above is the bench test of a single piece of sheet metal. (higher is better)[/I]

In the bench test, myth busted, Grace Ice &amp; Water Shield may be a fine roofing material, but it is nearly worthless as a damping material.

In the car door test, I tried to go crazy and added more Roadkill to the outer door skin, applied some to the inner door skin, and then added a mass-loaded-vinyl barrier to the inner door skin to further isolate noise and prevent it from entering the cabin.  Even with these stronger measures I only saw an increase of 26% damping over the factory car door.

So what is going on?  Clearly from the bench test a single layer of Roadkill (on 25% surface area) should have a drastic effect on damping factor for sheet metal.  However the car door behaves differently.  I believe the car door having (1) an outer wall of sheet metal and (2) an inner wall of sheet metal and (3) another inner wall of plastic and vinyl door card and (4) air chambers between all these layers are responsible.  I believe the air chambers themselves have resonances that cannot be affected by damping the sheet metal and must be addressed other ways.

Conclusion?  Buy a CLD tile from a common brand (or sounddeadenershowdown) and apply it in a single layer over about 25% to 50% surface area for excellent results (adding more doesn't increase benefits for the high additional cost).  Also

So how can we take your car's audio system and use modern measurement tools to objectively improve sound quality on a budget?  The answer is Real Time Analysis.  All you need is a smartphone (iPhone or Android), you play [pink noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise) through your audio system and the microphone monitors the signal and shows you a graph of how loud each frequency is.  This should be done in a quiet environment with the engine and AC off.  The goal, in essence, is to get the graph to be flat.  Now, most high-end car audio systems are probably going to have extra bass.  You should try to get flat response across the bass frequencies, but how much bass you have is a matter of taste. 

The best method to achieve good frequency response is equalization.  This can either be an EQ built into your head unit or a separate piece of hardware.  Basically

So, your friends' cars, your home theater, etc.  And I don't work for Dayton Audio or anything, I just think it's amazing how cheaply they can produce such a nice piece of hardware.

Yesterday I tried install some 0 gauge wire on my 05' Trailblazer EXT. What I did is put wire from battery - to car chassis , I made sure I tightened everything and now the car does not start.

As of right now I can't even get my key out of the ignition. When I put the key to the ""on"" position, onstar, etc. Only thing that is a little weird is that I get ABS and E-brake warning lights even though the E-brake is not engaged. 

When I try to crank over the car


As a last resort I took off all the wire I added on and still the car will not start and the same problems persist. Anyone have any clue or anything I could try would be greatly appreciated because I need my car for work. I also tried jump starting the car and replacing the battery with another one and the car will still not start.

* Adding external car audio resource links to the side bar (the12volt.com, http://diymobileaudio.com, etc...). Perhaps a separate set of links for accessory/integration  product companies such as Metra, AI, peripheral audio, PAC etc.. (dash kits, harnesses, interfaces, give newbies a good beginner resource

* Posting OC that deals with current make/model wire colors that may not be readily available on the net/sites like direct tech (good for unavailable new models and those that don't have access to sites like direct tech). This could also go back to all Makes/Models in the past to current. From what I remember from my car audio installation days at Best Buy years ago

* Perhaps a list of the car audio installers that frequent this subreddit by location. If you contribute to /r/CarAV and are an installer redditors that see your submissions who are located in your area may come to you for work

* In depth tutorials (possibly bimonthly). These could range from basics installs to how you custom fabricated a system, I wouldn't be opposed to sharing specs on them (it would cut down on time for us to build custom boxes for different vehicles .

* If the community grows future plans could include things like car shows/meetups

While I go to a plethora of forums and sites for car audio info I think it would be great to combine many of these aspects into the /r/CarAV subreddit if possible. While /r/CarAV is still small it will continue to grow and it would be great to build on top of the great subreddit CarAV already is.

My Highs are running off of the Kappa Four class d.

The Subs are the MTX 9500 Series 12's in dual 4 ohm voice coils.  The box we made about a year ago which sadly i had to go back in and add screws to it.  The subs created too much flex in the wood and it broke the strut supports in the box

The Sub amp is the MTX Thunder elite 1501D Mono.  Running at 1 ohm.

If you have any questions

As my loving father pointed out
Those are Polk Audio MM1240's.
I used special resin and fiberglass cloth from US Composites. I recommend it highly over traditional Home Depot stuff.
Including both subs
The resin smell remains
The rings I got made at a cabinet shop. 
Took ~5 days start to finish. 
I didn't cloth the backs of the boxes cause they can't be seen and I didn't want to mess with the glove-like fit. Although I think I may to add some cushion between the fiberglass and my car.
I still have to add the speaker wire quick-disconnects to make the boxes removable.

1363105948.0,1a5k6w,"How do you explain to someone DVC, resistance, RMS vs peak power ratings, current draw etc? ",remarkable53,1

DVC (Dual Voice Coil) Look at your sneakers?  How many eyelets does it have?  Lets say there are 6


Resistance:  Imagine a long hose and we needed to get water out about 200' how much pressure would it take? As the AC Current leaves the amp heading for the speaker the wire coils that are wrapped around the voice coil present resistance to that AC signal the less resistance will yield more water while the more resistance less however with less resistance you run the chance of the hose developing a kink or a hole because it is moving so much material thru.

RMS vs Peak power in amp ratings:  If any amp uses it's peak power rating as it's headline it's telling you it's a joke with a fuse.  Imagine you have to describe someone to me?  You would most likely start by saying this person is 6' tall wouldn't you?  You wouldn't say this person can jump high enough to touch the rim to describe a 6' tall guy.  That's in essence what using peak power vs RMS power or continuous power ratings is doing.  It's really total bullshit and one should not be considered when comparing amps.

Current draw:  You have $13.75 in your bank account.  Every month it cost you $11.00 to cover your expenses and in summer when you kick on your AC add $1.25 and if you own a pool add 35 cents.  So what are you left with? That's the same thing with your alternator and why the hell your lights dim and strobe to the beat of your 4000 watt Ampzilla sucking amp.  Your alternator can only generate so much current and the amp is demanding more than what is available and so it's taking current that was designed for other components and converting it into bass.  Your living on credit cards my man.  There can be no happy ending in this scenario.

This is a random set of images. In the front doors are Polk MM6501's

In the rear are Inifnity 6832cf 6x8's. Also behind the seats are two Sundown Audio SD2-10's 4ohm dvc. Powering everything are two Precision Power Black Ice amps. A BK520.4 95w x 4 rms for the components and rears along with a BK1300.1D @ 1ohm to the subs. 
The box was custom made by Supercrewsound.com
I used a Kicker 0 gauge dual amp kit to power everything up. 
I had enough left over to do the big 3 in 0 gauge. The alternator was also upgraded to a 200 amp model. 



Finally my favorite part. I had limited space and wire running options. So there was a mess behind the amps. I made the cover out of peg board and 4mm self adhesive sound dampening foam meant for a computer case. That turned out good enough that I made another piece to cover the front of the amps.

I am looking to build a system for my jeep

As far as I understand it, stay away from Boss, and schoche. Any other brands to definitely not get?

What about Power Acoustic

I like Rockfords

I have come to really like the sound of poly cones and silk dome tweets.

Now

I have a '61 lincoln continental.  I'm planning to use a tablet as my only audio interface, and didn't really have intentions for rear speakers.

I listen to electronica, and I like the sound of an accurate closed box sub or a good frequency curved ported sub.  bandpass or peaky ported are out of the question.

The doors will need to be thin profile speakers.  I'd prefer coaxial mounted separates if those exist still.

The trunk will have 1 to 2 cu ft of space per sub

I'm a fan of the idea of class D amps.  Low heat small

What prices should i be considering?  What brands are decent?  I'm actually not a fan of pioneer, but people off the street wouldn't recognize.  It's just an aesthetic thing.

The next step is to reinforce the doors with fiberglass. What is there now is just bed sheets that has been hardened with fiberglass resin. (a cheap solution to other similar materials). This is in fact my second time working with fiberglass and am not that experienced with it

My question to you CarAV is... Should I paint it.. or go about some other method of covering it? There are lots of different types of material that can be used to cover the panels but I was hoping to get an opinion.

During the selection process I had decided from reviews and from friends experiences to go Alpine for everything.  I was not interested in pounding bass from a subwoofer but sought incredible ear splitting quality. 

My set up was awesome.  
[Alpine CDA-9887](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/cda-9887/)
[SPR-60C](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-60c) front speakers
[SPR-69](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-69) rear speakers
[PDX-F4](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/pdx-f4) Four Channel Amp 
I took full advantage of the imprint system with this [KTX-100EQ](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/ktx-100eq-1/)

I had it professionally installed and I definetly spent a pretty penny on the set up.  I did the imprint system myself and LOVED it.  I am sure some hearing damage resulted but what can you expect.  The clarity was incredible and I had an awesome time with the system.  REALLY obvious discrepencies in quality between CDs and iPod connections.  I absolutely loved that head unit and was tickled pink.

Anywhoo to the sad part.  I was woken up on the morning after my birthday, my car has a smashed window and I could not even turn on the heat.  

That was a sad sad day.

Just saying there's no need to spend a shit-ton of money when you can make do with things you already have a lot of the time.

It's going to be mounted on a rental van roof and the power will end at alligator clips on the battery. That's the current plan at least.

[EDIT] So I'm thinking I could use a single home outlet [like this](http://www.remodelista.com/products/leviton-688-w-1-gang-recessed-single-receptacle) and then just use two pronged extension cords to get to the car battery and attach the wires directly or with alligator clips.

The primary reason for this is that I have a 2005 Mustang and don't want to sacrifice too much trunk space just for my sound system but at the same time I don't want to limit my subwoofer options. Sure I could get a pre-fab enclosure to fit behind the rear wheel wells but where's the fun in that?!? Plus nothing that's commercially available puts out the power I want so

So being pretty new to fiberglass work I did some searching and came across this instructables link (among other links... but I did the research months ago but just had this link saved):  
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Fiberglass-Subwoofer-Box/

I guess at this point I'm curious what the pros and cons of a fiberglass enclosures like these are. If done right (avoiding sharp angles

______________________
At the end of the day my plan is to create 2 assemblies:

One assembly would consist of a sealed subwoofer enclosure which would sit behind the passenger side rear tire and hold a 10"" or 12"" sub. This enclosure would extend forward to the front of the trunk with a cutout for a flush mounted amp (The amp enclosure would be heavily insulated against vibrations from the subwoofer). The sub enclosure would definitely be fiberglass to contour to the shape of the trunk space... but the part that extends forward may be MDF covered in carpet to give a clean appearance.

The other assembly would essentially be a mirror of the first,,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,True

This was fine and all
  
In any case, have some spare cash, why not upgrade to get for loud, clean, clear setup?  So I do some research, and decide to by some component speakers:  
  
4xJBL GTO638 6.5-Inch 3-Way Speakers (~$150)  
  
And an amp to get the volume up just in case:  
Rockford Fosgate P400-4 400 Watt 4-Channel Amp (~$170)  
  
I figured I should get a pretty good sound after the investment.  I pay a local shop to do the install (~$200).  Prob could have paid less
  
Get the install done ('98 Durango, and I'm thinking ""This sounds kind of ok, but not worth the money.""  The highs are really distorted, very little mid range or base.  I expected a decent sound from component speakers, not overly bright.  I adjusted the EQ on the deck, treble all the way down (-6), base up (+2), and that was that.  Well today, just soft).  Now I'm thinking I just wasted a bunch of money
  
Here are  the questions:  
  
Is the deck I have too terrible (It honestly sounded fine before with stock speakers
  
Are my settings off somewhere?  
  
Did I purchase the wrong amp/speaker combo?  
  
Did I get bad equipment (doesn't seem likely)?  
  
Or did I get a bad install?  
  
I don't know where to start.  I'm going to take it back to the installer for help

Bonus question: I lost the ability to fade front to rear

I have an amplifier that keeps going into protection mode and I am trying to figure out why.

My system consists of 4 Polk Audio speakers in the doors of my vehicle, and my deck is a Kenwood KDC-X396.  I just hooked all this stuff up about 25 days ago.  

Everything was working beautifully until last night, when the sub would make the popping noise, my vehicles interior and exterior lights would dim at the same time.  After about 5 seconds, the amp went into protect mode.  I then unplugged the sub rca's and started the car again.  The speakers played music fine for about 3 minutes, then the amp went into protection mode again.

So next I tested my sub woofer and its wiring:  the wiring is fine, so I think the sub woofer is fine, though I don't have a way to hook it up to another amp to see if it plays.

Today, because it is reading the same voltage as the amp terminals.

I am starting to wonder if either my amp is bad, so if you have any ideas or wisdom please chime in!

So if you're planning to install a single amp now keep in mind that if you want to add an additional amp in the future that you'll need a heavier gauge power wire to accommodate for both amps. You might as well invest in the heavier gauge now.

It is a total of 36"" long, in a chamber that is 12"" long, 13.5"" tall, and 6"" deep. On both sides of this chamber are 2 other chambers that are 10.5 long by 13.5 tall and 6"" deep. They are separated by MDF with 2 4""diameter holes into each chamber. The chamber on the right has a 2"" hole in the ""floor"" that passes into the final bottom chamber, that runs the entire length of the box and is 2"" deep and exits the left of the box. It is the full width and length of the box, 2"" deep.

It doesn't sound terrible

I've done just an absolutely horrible job illustrating this on my picture. For reference, and the BLUE should show the dual chambers. The RIGHT chamber has a 2"" opening the width of it to a bottom chamber (GREEN) that runs the length of the box and exits the LEFT.

In my current vehicle I have an aftermarket head unit with 10"" sub. From having my setup for close to 1 1/2 years I really can't see myself without an upgraded sound system. I'm trying to achieve having an amp (I believe 4-channel) power aftermarket speakers and the subwoofer I have now.

My problem: The 2012 Ford Focus has been known to be a pain in the arse about aftermarket equipment; from drilling out rivets to only 1 or 2 head unit dash kits. I don't want to replace the mediocre audio just to improve quality but lose the great features that Sync and the stock radio provide. 

My solution: Would it be possible to run one of the speaker wire sets (any one of the stock speaker wires) to an adapter or simply convert them to rca/headphone jack and plug into my aftermarket radio (removed to put in new car in glovebox or some other area out of the way) then run audio out from aftermarket radio to amp in trunk which would go to speakers and subwoofer?

Pros: Do not have to remove stock radio, it wouldn't cost too much money speaking I already have most of the expensive equipment, and having fun setting it all up.

Cons: Questionable audio quality (depends if you guys know a way to get best sound from stock radio)

I have also checked to ensure they fit.

I am also looking into speaker baffles for the doors but don't know much about them.

The amps are apparently refurbished audiopipe amps and are very inexpensive from [vvme.com](http://www.vvme.com/car-audio/car-amplifiers) (I know if it seems too good to be true it probably isn't)

To power my 10in alpine R sub w/ dual voice coil wired for 8Ohm the amp that is priced at $92.70 listed as

To power the door speakers I was looking at any of the 4-channel amps they have listed.

Also looking into capacitors from that site but I doubt this set up will need one.

Over the summer I threw in a 12"" sub and was now very pleased with my cars sound system. 

But now I have a couple concerns and questions that I'd thought I'd ask some more experienced people about. 

My system is as follows:

*Give me a bit to get up links for these.

I know that my choice in head unit may not have been the greatest

My Questions:

What is the best way to go about improving my front speakers sound output? They simply get overpowered by the rear speakers. My idea is to either drop a 5.25 speaker or a 6.5 speaker into the front door. I just need to find the right adapter (if possible) to fit the 4x6 stock mount. After reading a bit

Also, but I would not no where to start looking for the problem. Also, I did fix a problem where the head unit would cut out when I was driving because the 4 gauge wire running to the battery had become lose and intermittent to the battery was not charging itself properly. NOTE: I honestly haven't tried and seen if the head unit has had problems since i fixed the whole battery thing. 

One last thing
The factory speaker mounts are what I am currently using and I had to modify them a bit to fit the new ones. However

EDIT: Also, will only the sub be able to be run? Sorry if this question sounds ridiculous, I am just curious, as people suggests for optimal sound to run speakers from an amp.

Summary:

-Replace 4x6 door speakers with something more loud and crisp &amp; figure out how to mount them.

-Ideas for fixing head unit issues.

-Better way to mount my rear deck 6x9 speakers.  


Please if anything I said sounds ridiculous, but as this is only my first time, I have a shitload to learn.

My second amp is an Alpine MRP-M500 @ 60A feeding a Memphis MRClass 12"" DVC subwoofer. The voice coils are 4 ohm, I also have some carpet on order with mass backing and a 100 sq ft roll of 45 mil sound deadening.

Now that we're past all that... in my last question I posted here someone recommended I pick up a Pioneer DEH-80PRS. I did some research on it and I like the unit, and my amps accept up to 4V. Is there a way to step the voltage down? I don't want to replace my amps just because I'm replacing my head unit, as that will take away from my funds I've put aside in other areas of this restoration. And what else would you recommend I do? Aside from saving up the funds to get some much higher-end speakers in the future I don't know of what else I can do. I haven't noticed much of a voltage drop in my system since the Big 3 upgrade but my lights do dim a little at night...nothing drastic, but would you recommend a HO alternator or another battery?

Essentially once I am done with my restoration, I want them (and myself) to be blown away, every time. I listen to a wide variety of music, including (older) country, rock, hip hop, metal,,False,t3_17tlw1

Sound Deadening is the act of reducing cabin noise in your automobile.  For example, wheel wells, floor, ceiling, and notice a reduction in noise in the cabin.

There is a lot of theories as to 'whats the most bang for your buck', Wheel Wells, Floor, Cieling, in that order, will give you the biggest return per investment.

Sound deadening is actually just stopping vibrations and bolts from rattling.  You can go a step further and include foam inserts just like you would put insulation in a house

I have an android phone with HDMI out and is listed on the Pioneer as supported(Optimus 2x, the ""No video watching in the front"" popup intermittently pops up. And the Pioneer app significantly restricts access to the phone interface(and for good reason!) when the parking brake is disengaged.

iOS compatibility, from what I've seen on the iOS App Store, the iPhone 4S and 5 with iOS6 have issues(the 5's issue being Lightning and not Pioneer). My iPod Touch 4th gen with iOS6 works just fine. So does my friend's 4S with iOS5.

Pros:
Stylish UI and HU design. The UI is clean

Cheaper than the Sony MirrorLink HUs and works on any Android 4.0+ device with HDMI and Bluetooth

Good sound. iPod DAC bypass on that note with bundled cable!

Ambient light sensor for readability in the sun.

I do not consider myself to be an audiophile, except for the piece de resistance: the subwoofer(s). The problem is, I am not as educated as most of you are in *car audio*. That being said, I cannot judge how much bass will be too much, or too little for a small trunk space in a mazda3 sedan.


I am looking at buying two Alpine type D 10' subs or one JL Audio 10W3v3-2 10' sub. I have heard both in stores, I would probably buy a ported box. The whole car **will be dynomated**.

Some pro-tips to keep your stuff. Might be common sense


1. Alarm. Alarms will deter all but the most determined scum. A broken window or gouged keyhole sucks but still cheaper and easier than all of it. 



Along with an alarm. Do not get it installed at the same shop everybody else does in your neighborhood. Thieves know their mounting and install methods. I'd recommend yourself


Do not bump in plainly public



If you park on the street do not under any circumstances play loudly coming or leaving home from work. 



Advertisements: This one is the worst. Advertising your local shop, tells would-be-thieves that you have stuff of value in your car. I've seen Alpine banners on Convertss. Even with an alarm, have fun paying for a new roof. 





Keep stuff out of view. Your 200+ cd player's faceplate comes off. Do it. It keeps a thief from knowing your radio is a loaded Kenwood or a junk Jensen, vindicitive kids just take the face. Have fun paying half your radio for just one part. Hide remotes and cables and ipods. Kill switches too.

I've seen two ways of testing this so far... One way is to swap completely to another amp that you know is good. The quickest way to check RCA connections however requires absolutely no effort. 
 
This post comes after watching someone pull their whole head unit (not easy in their car) to see if their RCAs are connected. 
 
You'll need a female RCA to female or male 3.5mm connector. You'll also need a 3.5mm barrel connector if the converter was F2M. The last thing you need is a pair of headphones. 
 
Unplug RCA from amp, and put music on the head unit.

I have a 2003 Volkswagen Golf and I'm desperately in need of a new sound system! I have a Sony MEX-BT3900U head deck


I went into an audio store and he recommended the following configuration:

Speakers: Sony XS-GTX1621S - $199

Amp: Sony XM-GTR4A - $349

Sub: Soundstream Stealth 13"" - $499

$129 for cabling and $345 for install.

Total $1

...which is really more than I want to pay. I'm not confident enough doing my own install so I'll definitely be paying someone to do that.

I was chatting to a friend later and he found this package http://www.jonvy.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=2073 which includes:

- Pioneer TS-W309 12"" Single Voice Coil Subwoofer for Enclosed and Free-Air use 1000W

- 12"" Black Single Subwoofer Box - Quality!

- Pioneer GM-6500F 4 Channel Bridgeable Amplifier (760W)

- Pioneer TS-A1604C 6-1/2"" 2-Way A-Series Component Speaker System

For $499 NZ = $376 USD not including install.

A couple of questions then:

1. How well will each setup compare to each other? I had a chance to try out the aforementioned Sony set up with the Soundstream sub and I was definitely impressed/in love.

2. What other setup will suit me? I listen to mostly electronic music and bassy stuff. Ideally I don't want to have to pay more than $450 USD (--is this reasonable? I'm not interested in super super loud stuff. I live in New Zealand and pretty much everything here is more expensive than in the US

Hopefully they have the Pioneer stuff set up in their showroom so I can go and have a listen this week.

Any advice appreciated! Thanks in advance.

1330926606.0,qi7nh,f150 supercab budget build.,baron32191,5,1,8,"Just bought this truck and wanted to share my recent build. 
My budget: $500. I didn't have much to spend. I am currently paying for a wedding and was in dire need of bass. I drive a lot and the lack of music was killing me. I knew most of this was going to go to a nice head unit. More on this later.

Things I had from my old truck: 

-some junk JVC head unit

-[Rockford fosgate punch 6.5 components.](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=112892) 

-Rockford fosgate p3d412 subwoofer in a sealed 1.2ft^3 custom enclosure. ( box was designed for my old extended cab s10) 

-[Rockford fosgate p300-1 amp](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=108231)

I decided anything I did needed to be easily upgraded in the future. This meant not skimping in areas that would give me more work later.

I started off looking for a head unit. I wanted a nice touch screen unit with 3 sets of preamp-outs and ipod control
There goes $300 of my budget. [Here it is installed.](http://i.imgur.com/8tKjT.jpg) It even matches all the green lights in the dash. :)

Next up came the front speakers. My 6.5 components wouldn't fit in the factory opening and I wasn't about to cut apart the plastic door panel for speakers I wasn't sure I was keeping. So I traded a friend of mine for [these](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=112895). I ended up just leaving the stock speakers running off the head unit in the back doors.

So I was left with $200. I still needed a sub that would fit under the rear seat. The P3 just wasn't going to fit without giving up a seat in the back. So I did some searching and found [this.](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-db840DVC-8-Inch-Subwoofer/dp/B0016GV1UU/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) I figured for $50 I would give it a shot. I should also note that I am a firm believer in a quality well built boxes. I planned out a ported box that would fit perfectly under my rear seat
I ended up spending about ~40 on 3/4"" mdf to build the box and amp rack. I used my old RF p300-1 to power it.

I was now at $110. I still needed a wiring kit and the front speakers were dying for more power. I picked up a 1/0 gauge wiring kit on ebay for $40. I order 2 more rca cables for another $20. I was now at $50 for a 4ch amp. 

So I went against my instincts and bought [this.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSLEE4/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_details) Can't say I was very proud of my purchase

Here is a couple images of the [sub getting fit in the whole I cut](http://i.imgur.com/D0lIR.jpg) and another [test fitting under the back seat.](http://i.imgur.com/xZEQ8.jpg) The box actually sits further back than it looks. I had mounted the amps nicely behind the back seat but sadly I didn't take any pictures.

Final thoughts: 
I am actually very happy with the way everything turned out. The box came out pretty good for being my first ported box build. It provides a nice amount of bass that I was missing. Its not window shattering or anything but it sounds good. Everything went better than I expected. I wish I had taken more pictures

One more thing. I needed a cheap alternative to dynamat for my back wall. I picked a roll of [this up.](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=100028603&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=100028603&amp;cm_mmc=shopping-_-googlebase-_-D26X-_-100028603) It worked out better than I expected.

About 2 months ago I bought a '96 Celica which has a pretty epic sound system in it.  Now I have no problems with it, and a lot of bass seems to go to the 6.5"" speakers which probably contribute to the 'slapping' sound because of a higher frequency of bass? Please correct me if im wrong.  These 6.5"" speakers are installed into the flat piece that comes down over the boot.

This is what I have installed:

* [Sub](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_12269_JBL-W12GTi-MkII.html)
* [Amp](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_9711_Infinity-Reference-1600A.html)

* [Head Unit](http://www.jvc.co.nz/assets/pdf-brochure/KD-R616.pdf) Aplogies for the PDF

So to be honest, however anything telling me what is right/wrong or what to do is what I am looking for.

My initial thoughts were that the amp wasn't powerful enough to power the sub and speakers.  I came up with this idea by looking at the sub which is 6 Ohms and 700W rms, it lead me to think that the sub needs more juice.  Please do correct me if I am way off track, because I probably am (I failed Physics in my last year at high school).

Anyway

I am putting these connectors on wires to attach to the door speakers.  I ran into the following quirks:

1) the smaller female disconnect seemed to not provide enough room for the thickness of the speaker terminal.  I am not referring to width, but it isn't tight enough that it won't come off with a good tug (being careful not to damage the terminal obviously).  Is that how you want the the disconnect to fit on the terminal?  It just seems like such an insignificant amount of surface area to connect to the speaker where everything else is all 14-16 guage wiring with extra secure and thick fittings.

2) I wasn't sure what to do with the wire once you put it through the connector.  I actually fed it into the connector past the crimping point so that the wire also makes some contact with the terminal.  I thought this would be the better connection because there is more surface area touching

3) I just crimped the connectors on and covered the crimping point and part of the wire with heat shrink tubing.  Some people say solder

4) I ran out of wiring when I made it to my fourth door.  I was impatient and bought some convenient Monster wire.  After running that wiring I noticed that it is copper.  My other speaker wires are not copper (silver in color...).  Will this make an audible difference?  It is actually home speaker wire, and twisted.  I really wish that I just ordered the same wiring and learned patience.  From what I can tell, because they wiring is high quality, of a similar construction, and Monster, it should be Ok.

SO... My dad gave me his car (2002 Hyundai Accent Sedan) for a while until I can get myself a car.. I probably will be driving his car for like the next year.. BUT the only problem is that the audio is shit. Someone told me it's the ground wiring. So what happens is, the car audio turns off (I have very old speakers, I will change them all to Pioneer speakers in a little). The only way to turn it back on would be either to keep driving and wait, make a hard left turn, or sometimes slam the passenger door.

2002 Hyundai Accent Sedan;

HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO:

Option 1: Ask a shop to rewire the wiring for the audio system

Option 2: If someone can help me out with how to do that (above option), I will put in the new Pioneer speakers. I will need to know what wires I should buy, that's where I need reddit help.

Option 3: I fix whatever is wrong with it and not change anything and save my money for speakers in my new car (hopefully it will be a BMW M3

~~Someone recommended this [pioneer](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-FH-X700BT-In-Dash-Receiver-Bluetooth/dp/B0091UW7F6) head unit, how would I wire up this system- especially since the powerpack has 2 pairs of RCAs. An alternative would be to get an amp for the speakers, thinking about this [pioneer](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-Mobile-GM-D8604-4-Channel-Amplifier/dp/B00A02PG0C/ref=sr_1_2?s=car&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367792309&amp;sr=1-2). In that case, how would the RCAs be wired? Also, I'm assuming there's a big difference between 45w RMS and 100w RMS to each speakers.. considering the speakers I want to get, would it be worth just getting the amp. It just became summer, so I got all the time in the world.. I would enjoy the extra work8)~~


New plan.. [clarion headunit](http://www.amazon.com/Clarion-CX501-Double-DIN-Bluetooth-Receiver/dp/B004KVLB9E/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368079488&amp;sr=1-1) with this [powerpack](http://www.amazon.com/Clarion-Mobile-Electronics-XC1410-4-Channel/dp/B00B43LKV0) for the speakers. Bridge the headunit to run 2 speakers @ 100w; bridge the amp to run other two @ ~150w.. you think that'll suffice for a bumping system?




The speakers I'm thinking about getting are [polk front](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-DB6501-6-5-Inch-Component/dp/B000P0R6LQ) or perhaps [infinity front](http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Reference-6030cs-6-5-Inch-Component/dp/B002BS5YAA/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368080233&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=infinity+component+speakers+6.5). Which would you guys choose?


Next


Finally, I can get a RMS max of 800W at 2ohm but is it really necessary to get every last juice out of the subwoofer? How much power do people usually match up to the speakers specs?  Also this [installation kit](http://www.amazon.com/KnuKonceptz-KCA-Complete-Gauge-Installation/dp/B0050I6KII/ref=pd_sim_e_3) for the amp. Finally, to wire the new speakers, would it be best to run new wires to each speaker and which gauge, or can I just hook the power pack to the wire harness?

Lately I've had some issues with the electrical system.

This happened even when I was driving, and the intervals in between the shutoffs would get shorter and shorter until it wouldn't even come all the way on. These two problems made me think the battery was going, as it was just a cheap starting battery.

So, but what would cause this? I would assume the alternator has something to do with it but it's been shutting off when I'm driving even with the sub amps turned completely off and the volume really really low. Could my alt be going bad or just not putting out enough?

I also have a small FM transmitter for my iPhone, but just be plugged in. Otherwise, the transmitter cuts in and out depending on it's orientation at the bottom of the phone, and if I cup my hand around it, the car radio picks it up stronger.

* speaking of multi-channel amps

* my next project before adding the second amp is building my own power cables to replace the shitty off the shelf wiring kit i have now. i plan on running 4ga to the distribution block then 8ga to the amps blah blah. would i need a second distribution block for the amp grounds or do i run them separately from each amp to my chassis ground? i know everyone here swears by knukonceptz wire but i'm trying to source as much as i can locally

1360436606.0,187d6l,RCA/Amp question on new deck,wanna_meet_that_dad,4,1,5,I updated the stock head unit on my 2004 mustang. I replaced the Mach 460 system with a Pioneer x6500bt. I have never done any audio work on cars but everyone kept telling me its so simple. So I gave it a shot and in no time it was installed and everything worked great! After a few days of listening and tweaking with the EQ and other settings I started wondering if the amp had been connected correctly. The sound was good overall but everything deep seemed hollow and weak. So I took it back out to see if different RCA (Red &amp; White) combos would change anything and to my surprise nothing changed. Even when they were unplugged it didnt change anything. This leads me to believe I screwed up somewhere... Like I said everything works great. Any insight on what I need to do would be awesome!  ,t5_2t73y,True

My stock head unit is failing on me and I am a poor student so my budget is small but I think I can do a decent job with the stuff I got. Got tools at my disposal and my brains. 

My plan is too purchase a modern head unit first that will blend into the existing dash lighting. 
This pioneer looked good and will pair well with my Android (sgs3):

Second thing I would like to do is install a wireless Charing solution for the s3 owners in my family. It involves the palm pre touchstone chargers and charging plates. I would like to velcro the base to somewhere on the dash or near the cup holders but I want the micro usb cable leading into the base to be hidden away and always plugged in. Problem is that the car charging ports in my truck always stay powered and I'm afraid this will kill the battery of it remains plugged in to one of the sockets. Is there any way around this? Another caveat is that it needs at least 2a and will charge with nothing less. I was hoping maybe one of you can tell me how to wire a micro usb cable providing 2.1a power through the dash. Maybe I can drill a small hole wherever the palm base will rest? I can put a picture of my dash up as well just so you guys have a better idea of the layout. 

Here's the teardown of the wireless charging stuff:

Ok so that's that. I will probably set up a nfc tag to put the phone in car dock mode and activate blue tooth and gps and so on but that's pending I can even get it installed. 

What do I do from here. I have the head unit and the palm stuff on order but I don't really know what else I need. Do I need a double din dash kit? Any wires? Harnesses? What's a harness? Screws? Please help me. I've spent about 160 on everything so far and don't want to spend too much more. Would rather spend money on travelling.

Vehicle: 2005 Nissan Pathfinder

Subs: 12inch JL wxV1

Amp: JL 500w amp

History-

Made my first purchase 4 years

For around 700 bucks 

[Eclipse CD1200G dual din stereo](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_21600_Eclipse-CD1200G.html)

2 12 inch JL W0V1

500 watt JL audio amp

Entry level box enclosure nonported 

To this day I'm not sure if that was a good deal but I was happy with it until this point...  

Anyway along the way over the years I went from the JL w0's to wx's and today one of them has blown. Instead of repeating this process I thought i'd get some advice from you guys before going forward.

I went into the shop again and inquired about replacing the blown 12inch sub. While I was there i was told about another clearance deal.  2 15inch JL w0's that already come in a enclosure. Basically the approach i took when i got my original install.

These 2 15inch JLs would be $235 with the box. I would either use my 500watt amp or get a new 1000watt amp im not sure yet.

Before I go forward what kind of purchasing philosophy would you guys recommend?

Bargin shop online for 2 new 15inch subs and amp then have this shop
install them?

Just replace the 12inch that has blown.

Buy the 2 15s already in a box from the shop.

Or some other approach?

I bought what I thought was the correct Stalk Unit for the car (it turns out it wasnt despite advice that it should have worked). The back of the Stereo looks like this:
http://i.imgur.com/ejI7xsJh.jpg

The cable I am holding is for the FM aerial (which i now have plugged in and working), play FM and DAB radio, play cds etc but when I switch the engine off the new radio stays on for a few minutes and then goes off automatically, also my clock display which shows time, radio station etc doesnt display correctly and it seems to lock the 'open door' messages and the clock stops counting - so it looks like the wiring is the wrong way round somewhere? Also when I switch the car off the stereo goes back to factory settings and doesnt remember any channels and is in default 'demo mode' and my steering wheel controls don't work so there is clearly something amiss.

So before I spend any more money I am hoping for some help

I feel like I am so close and just need a little bit of guidance to get it right! I have read a few sites suggesting that some of the cables are the wrong way round on the peugeots and need moving around.

My speakers are 15 years old

The front has a component set of 6.25""(2.5"" depth) and 1""(1"" depth) tweeters

I don't want to spend more that $250 for the front and amp

What are your recommendations for a good value 6.5"" component speaker set?

Thanks for your help

**EDIT**
~~It looks like the Alpine KTP-445 would be a perfect solution that gets the level of results I'm looking for.~~ Great advice! For anyone who sees this edit

Girlfriend bought me a JVC KW-R800BT head unit. I'm quite certain I can install that myself

1. What's the best way to route the microphone? I think I'd like to attach it to the A pillar
2. Is there an easy way to continue using the factory subwoofer with this unit? I'd like to not have to install an amp if possible. I don't need it to be loud
3. Are steering wheel interfaces such as [this](http://www.amazon.com/Metra-ASWC-Universal-Steering-Interface/dp/B0039H2W66/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354853071&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Axxess+ASWC) worth the money/effort?",self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/14fcvb/installation_advice/
