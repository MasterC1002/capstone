1369109882.0,1eqtrg,Today was my 21st birthday,flylowyoucarrioncrow,2067,555,605,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything

Anyways,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. ",,False,t5_2qqqf,True

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.

I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly

12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part.

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression.

1368462608.0,1e92yd,Battling depression is a skill. Here are some tips that worked for me.,Sk33tshot,688,101,170,"After battling depression over the last year, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy
Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me

1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 

2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze

3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, do a few pushups in your room, feel your body

4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 

5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, right now.

6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 

7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, just recognize what needs to be done, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 

8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, and overtime this adds up. 

9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts

EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.

EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. ""Making"" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 

Just don't do it to create something perfect

I am a pretender.

There are a lot of us.

We go about our day the same way that you do. We go to work, etc. We wave and smile at our neighbors, we water our plants, walk our dogs. But there is something different about us. It’s very delicate; it’s elusive and hard to put your finger on.
 
It’s a monster.

Pretenders blend into society seamlessly. Parents don’t know

In college I realized that I wasn’t normal. Other students would go out on the weekends and get drunk but I preferred to stay in, I still managed to make a few good friends. I found out later that they were also pretenders; no wonder we were drawn to each other.

Pretenders are hiding something deep inside them. There is a darkness that radiates. These people try hard to hide it

When I realized that I had this darkness, a psychiatrist, but the darkness fought back. I would escape it, if only for a day, and then it would drag me back in.
 
I’m not really sure what this monster wants

It took me four years to kill my monster. First, but I know how to defeat it now.

I'm writing this as a warning. This monster can be killed

Ask yourself

Find them, the stronger the darkness gets.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiWRoMOeoLo


The dementors in the book and film were a metaphor for depression. They sucked the life out of you leaving you feeling as if you'd never feel happy again. Although everyone was affected by the feeling, were more affected by it than others because of the horrors he had witnessed in his past. Some of his peers made fun of him, others worried, not understanding why he was greatly affected by the dementors.

He eventually seeks a way to repel the dementors, we see what *does* produce a strong charm against the dementors.

In the clip I posted

His past-self had thought someone else had produced the charm to save him, but by doing what was right, needed in the moment, and by believing in himself.

If you notice Harry's face in the clip when he produces the charm, happiness eventually finds him. Your goal out of depression shouldn't be to feel happy, but to be happy. Being happy means doing what you know is right, doing what you need to do, and *being* optimistic even when you *feel* worried, etc.

I spurned an Ivy League education thanks to my guilt of being smarter than you. You earned a full athletic scholarship to the family jock school a few years earlier and you still couldn't let me shine. I defended you when my boss called you a ""lesbian cunt"" behind your back. And you couldn't defend me when he yelled at me twice a week for two years regarding things that even *his boss* said didn't matter. And then you tell former colleagues that I was ""the family loser"".

You went on your first date on your 27th birthday; I seem to think your rotten personality was a factor. My best female friend since third grade was asked out by her now husband of 11 years/father of their three children. He is not a child molester just because he chose a 21 year old woman instead of choosing you. I encouraged him to get a lawyer, including you. An emotionally trampled man, emasculated by his environment, and defeated by cruel words hurled in his direction was the perfect victim for those succubi. I was a man unable to stand up for himself, for his dreams, nor for his self-worth.

Controlling people use ""trying to help"" as a mask for their real intentions. Mom and Dad frequently overcompensate by saying you are a great person. All those years of ""I'm ignoring you loser"" taught me that I was pathetic reaching out for conversation with an emotional vampire. All those times that you tattled indicated that a cool sister---or even an average sister---wouldn't do that, not to mention three years and running---has been magnificent for my self-esteem. You're finally done mistreating me.

I hate it so much that you had to pretend to be sick for 95 days in 7th grade because you were getting picked on at school. It serves you right for all those years (before then and since) of picking on the three of us. Mom and Dad used all their vacation days that year and they made trips to 17 baffled doctors because of your ""headaches"". A lie for a minute or a lie for a whole school year is **STILL** a lie. My music collection doesn't have enough female musicians so you should make a scene about it at Niagara Falls. You really hate me if you lambaste me for a peccadillo like that.

You shouldn't have lectured your one boyfriend in 33 years about the CORRECT way to make macaroni and cheese; he said that was the last of a thousand straws. All those years of calling me a loser, asshole, and retard taught me that love doesn't sound like that. It took him six years to stand up to you, significantly fewer years than it took me. No, I don't root for the family jock school, and if that bothers you, get a life. Fans (you and Oldest Sister especially) of that school really are horrible.

""Get over it"" during my wife's breast cancer at age 33, during each of my wife's two layoffs, during my wife's parents getting divorced after 27 years of marriage, and also during my broken wrist. ""Get over it"" is the worst three-word phrase in the English language and I will always hate it thanks to you. Your oil changes at the **BMW** dealership being *so expensive* demonstrate that you can't handle the slightest adversity. I loved the four separate occasions of the silent treatment for at least a year each, not to mention three years and running. You're finally done mistreating me.

**Dad**
Thank you for ""all Asian women are ugly, you're here illegally"". I will never hate anyone based on looks. You have made it clear that all of your grandchildren must be baptized by their first birthdays. My wife and I are agnostics so good luck with that asshole. Your preferences in life have to be the same as those of your children----what a perfect example of how **NOT** to raise my kids.

Slapping my oldest sister and slapping my youngest sister were not the best courses of action. Neither is laughing at me when I struggle opening my wife's radiation medicine. I can't imagine you honestly believe that ""[Middle Sister and I] need to behave better but [Oldest Sister and Youngest Sister] misbehave **occasionally** because they are ""products of recessive genes"". Middle Sister did not deserve to be thrown against the bunk bed when she was 14 years old because she told you that you were being a jerk. All of us were thinking far worse words than ""jerk""

""[Your] opinions are facts and [my] opinions are opinions"". Well

**Mom**
I am too sensitive huh? I betcha can't say that while Dad drinks a glass of water. Anything to yet again avoid the back of his hand. Thank you for the criticisms of everything from my dairy intake to having my identity stolen and the ensuing false arrest. You failed as a mother if you can't let me make my own decisions. So you do have a spine? Only when dealing with me, perfect kids, perfect career, perfect figure, perfect people pleaser personality, perfect education, perfect siblings, and my family therapist plans to bring it down a la Mel Gibson at the end of ""Lethal Weapon 2"". You don't have diplomatic immunity. Well

**Now the time has come. I get to live my life *MY WAY*

**Me** (third of four
I learned to accomplish epic shit just to spite all of you. I won a national title in a high school academic competition (against 1200 competitors). **SOME** people care about me and the rest belong out of my life. It cost me thousands of dollars in therapy to learn that sentence. Here it is again. **SOME** people care about me and the rest belong out of my life. 

I earned a statistics degree in four years while working forty hours a week. I busted my ass for an MBA a semester early while working 20 hours a week and driving 106 miles a day. I have a marriage of two people who adore each other; we are good friends, despite that he is 5-11 and 280. 

My suicide attempt in 2001 was due to people who are worth less than any of the sleeping pills. I lost 100 pounds thanks to the reduced stress of missing the last seven Christmases. All that credit card debt represents the happiness I tried to have; guess who paid it off anyway with three jobs for three years? Me you fucking losers. I will become an actuary no matter what you people said to me. Yes, and yes, only 36% pass each one. I have passed the first four all on the first try. Suck this. Determination combined with intelligence easily conquers test makers much of the time.

Love is not critical, manipulative, controlling, demeaning, humiliating, separating, discounting, belittling

Someone out there could be inspired by what I have done. He or she could overcome similar obstacles and have his or her life changed forever. I had nobody to help me until I met my wife. Now I am a beacon for a suffering soul drowning in the sea of negativity literally anywhere in the world. Your abuse has inspired me to write this post and to overcome everything in it. I am inspired to share and to enlighten

The ravine of insecurity, sarcasm, and anger holds each of you hostage and love is the escape you choose not to use.

Telling someone that they're your reason for living puts a lot of pressure on them.

I plan on sharing this with family and friends that do not really understand what it means to suffer from clinical depression

Click through to read the full article but here's a snippet:

&gt; Depression is not like sadness. Everyone has been sad. Everyone has been depressed on one occasion or another. But clinical depression is something else entirely.

&gt; What is it like?

&gt; Forgive me

&gt; Remember how that felt

&gt; Think of the most stressed and worried you have ever been in your life

&gt; Imagine that you are constantly gripped with overwhelming feelings of dread and crushing hopelessness — irrational

&gt; Imagine that you are often fatigued to the point of weakness and irritability because you can't get to sleep until late at night

&gt; Imagine that most social interactions become painful, foul shot of adrenaline, sizzling in your fingertips and bitter in your mouth.

&gt; Imagine that, no matter how well you grasp that these feelings are a symptom of a disease, you can't stop feeling this way.

&gt; Imagine that you have moments — maybe even minutes — where you forget how you feel

&gt; Imagine that you know you should talk to someone about how you feel — but you can't bring yourself to do so. Have you ever been so nauseated — from illness or from drinking — that you can't bear for someone to touch you or talk to you? Imagine feeling like that — that the human interactions that might ease the pain are too painful to endure

&gt; After a while

Three months ago I finally said goodbye to her for good.  I'm off of weed

I'm not 'happy' or 'content', it is because of my own personal negligence, not some whore's selfish manipulation.

I'm getting better everyday, the burn means it's working.

Okay

Make today your day.  Spoil yourself with your own Love.  Hug yourself.  Masturbate.  Sing a love song to yourself (Lady Gaga's are always crowd favorites).  Go on a romantic walk.  Write yourself a Love Letter.  Let yourself know that you will never leave you

I'm sick of the social ""trend"" of not having friends. Don't post a status saying ""omg have no friends"" or ""lol so depressed such a loner"" if you're on your way to a friend's house. I don't want your ironic hipster sadness shoved in my face when I'm barely staying alive every day.

walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as you’re out of everyone’s sight

Are Antidepressants just “happy pills?”
No matter what their exact mode of action may be, antidepressants only improve the mood of depressed people. Also unlike the almost instant effects of speed, the mood-improving effects of antidepressants develop slowly over a number of weeks. “Speed” induces a highly artificial state, antidepressants cause the brain to slowly increase its production of naturally occurring neurotransmitters.

I never considered the value of talking about bad things, it's so hard for me to do so I just bottle it all up.

Her advice was to find a counsellor in the new town I'm moving to at the end of the month and talk about some of these issues. And to start exercising because it will help release endorphins. She said to treat exercise as medicine

He laughed. He was already blocking the door.

“What are you gonna do

“Get out.” I said

The expression on his face changed from playful malice to anger. 

“What did you say?” He dropped his cigarette and put it out with his shoe. I noticed the gun in his hand as he walked towards me

“I don’t take orders from you

I closed my eyes and I suddenly became very aware of my breathing. I kept waiting for the gunshot to go off

I was neglected.  I was fed wrong on purpose.  I was taught improper hygiene techniques and diet.  By the time I left that house at the age of 18 I weighed 400 pounds.  

I spent the entirety of my adult life in recovery.  I suffered from deep, but I survived.

I built myself a support structure of friends who could help catch me when I fell.  When I did finally bottom out I lost the small business I'd created.  I put on another 100 pounds getting almost to 600 pounds.  I tried to eat myself to death.  I contemplated suicide every day

Eventually I went into therapy with genuine intentions to try.  We tried every drug we could find.  This was back when prozac was about the only thing and just small variants of that.  Most made me feel dead inside.  Some made it worse.  Nothing made it feel better.  

I tried losing the weight.  I couldnt find the motivation.  I ate myself into a prison of fat to match the prison in my mind.

Eventually we did find a drug that worked.  For me it was Effexor.  It gave me almost constant vertigo but for the first time in my life I felt like getting out of bed.  I felt like trying.  I felt like fighting.  I felt like I had the energy.

With that drug in my veins for the next 4 years I was able to slowly but surely grasp some of the tools I needed to start working around my depression.  I almost typed ""beat"" it but you never beat it

I tried losing weight.  I failed.  I tried getting a job.  I failed.  I tried dating.  I failed.  I tried getting past all that trauma.  I failed.  For years and years I fell flat on my face.

but something gave way about 3 years ago.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe it was the death of my mother

Whatever it is

I still have a lot of work to do to get my life together

Its hard.  I don't know if I'll ever feel like other people do.  But I do know that this is my life

So what I'm saying is this.
Please stay here.  You'll die one day anyways
Fight dammit.  Fight for what you want.  If the depression has you to a point to where you don't want anything, it also feels good as well.

AMA ,patientnumbertwo,238,38,88,"Wow, and [my second week](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/yqokx/i_just_completed_my_second_week_of_transcranial/).

What can I say?  It worked!  The depressive thought patterns and subsequent behaviors have diminished **significantly**.  I have been asked to describe it to professionals and laymen alike

Having depression is like owning a very large, and most days you just don't have the strength to keep from letting it happen. 

Most people don't have that strength.  But most people have normal sized dogs.  You have a normal-sized amount of strength with a very large dog.  The size of the dog and not being able to control it isn't your fault.

Not having depression means that YOU walk the dog.  It's still there.  Your bad memories and dark thoughts don't disappear.  They just don't crowd out all the other thoughts that occupy your head.  And when they go too far

Let me also say that not having depression is not a cartoon anti-depressant commercial.  The sun doesn't smile down on you, or discarded based on how usefully they serve you in living life in a way that makes you happy.  Depression trips that up.  Depression sucks.  And depression is not your fault.  ",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,1359662411.0,,

Got an orange and a banana and a cup of tea for breakfast

Did a short yoga routine

Ate some delicious barbeque chicken pizza leftovers for lunch

Took a nap! And didn't feel guilty at all

Spent some time responding to an email thread with another person whom I met a couple years ago,

Spent time on reddit

Watched Ferris Bueller

Made dinner for a friend and I, paprika, and brown sugar, cooked in about three tbsp of butter, with steamed vegetables and a beet-feta salad,

Spooned with friend (ok, just zoning with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes playing.

And now I'm going to drink a chocolate frap, nighttime yoga routine (oh my gosh I'm becoming such a Tara Stiles fan, she chills me out so much), and sleep.

DISCLAIMER: Meds and Therapy can and do work for many people

ANOTHER DISCLAIMER: try and limit how many of these you take on at once. A few small successes is better than one grand attempt and one grand failure. moreover


It is not easy

1. Write by hand a journal. Don't hold back on this thing

2. Meditate: just search beginners guided mediation

3. Get out of the house

4. Temporarily lay off the news: it is depressing

5. Stop drinking booze

6. Read ""The gifts of imperfection""- It is a different kind of self help book

7. Learn to critically think about life and start critically analyzing your negative and positive outlooks on life. Take them apart see how they work

8. Realize that you are fighting a very hard battle

9. Make the choice to live life even with depression. Its the same for Bipolar, and to get out and live, otherwise you wont get better. 


10. If you cant sleep try putting on www.Soothetube.com

11. exercise: Try and do it 2-3 times a week for at least 20 minutes

12. Create something, no pressure, low cost of entry and fun, and freaking tasty. [edit 4]

13. Take Vitamins, make sure you are getting enough vitamin D, all the B's, and  flax or fish oil ect. [Edit 5]

14. Related

15. From, shower, and groom yourself regularly. There is something so tribal and ritualistic about cleaning ourselves. It is a powerful force, I don't know how to explain it. Spend the money and get yourself a nice comfortable outfit, and change into it instead of staying in your Pjs. It really helps. 

16. As Boring as it sounds a routine is wonderful. 

17. Try different sleep rhythms but try and get 6-8 hours no matter what. If your a night owl try getting up early for once

18. Treat Depression like addiction. The day before doesn't count. Anything you do the day before that is negative  is negated at the end of the day meaning you start fresh every day. 

19. Accept that there are good days and bad days. They are both part of life. Try no to dwell on them but let the bad days and bad feelings happen. Don't try and fix them just let them be felt and then let them pass. The same with the good feelings

Hope this helps.

1375978497.0,1jyokh,'What does it feel like?' (TRIGGER WARNING),Misureth,212,31,53,"Something I struggle with all the time is trying to convey how it feels to be in a depressive episode to people who have never experienced it. Below is my latest attempt. Apologies for the length  (MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING).

*

It starts with something simple; maybe a rejection, it plants a seed of self doubt in your mind that won't go away. This leads to a consistent feeling of self hatred, the feeling that you are somehow unfit or that everyone would be better off if you weren't around to embarrass or annoy them; you begin to isolate yourself because of this.

The longer this isolation goes on, laughing, socialising, but on the inside you feel like you are slowly being ripped apart.

If you're like me, you're afraid of being stigmatised as a basket case, or having your masculinity questioned because you're a man who talks about his feelings. In any case, instead of seeking help you bottle your feelings up.

Slowly and painfully, able only to procrastinate and wile away your time abusing substances. You neglect your physical health, hygiene and work commitments; concepts like hours, days and weeks become meaningless as your life blurs into a meaningless sludge alternating between when it is light and when it is dark outside. Your brain seems to be fogged constantly, similar to the aftermath of a heavy night out, and thanks to your inability to have proper sleep you are constantly exhausted.

Eventually you hit rock bottom; you sleep and eat far too little or far too much, joy, excitement; all that persists is the exhaustion, the anxiety, the embarrassment. 

At this point you no longer experience what it means to be human; you are a husk

I've dealt with depression for about 15 years

In late 2009, or even physical problems, causing my depression.  Life *should have* been good, but it sucked and wasn't getting better.  Based on a lifetime of melancholy, introversion, and self-hate, I figured I should see a psychiatrist and give medication a shot.

It took about 6 months and 4 different medications until something made life better.  Citalopram, kind of trippy, and couldn't feel any sexual pleasure.  Then came Depakote.  Fuck that garbage, I felt heavily sedated all the time.  Abilify seemed to help, but not that much, and I might just have felt better because I wasn't on any of those other awful meds any more.

One fateful day, and replaced with a wonderful (and slightly scary) mania.

After talking with my doc, but long-acting and less likely to result in abuse/dependency.  I would later take a combination of Ritalin and Wellbutrin).   Life changed 180 degrees in about 2 or 3 days.  *This is how most people feel!  This is how people can just be happy most of the time, instead of one or two days a year!*

There were some side effects and some lifestyle changes (like quitting drinking) that needed to be done.  I made the mistake of stopping the medication instead of adjusting the dosage, hands down.

**Why I came to r/depression:**
One fateful day

My life, it was a 3.8 .  I had wonderful friends that I loved, who respected me.  I was dating an extraordinary woman.  I was applying to a number of cool teaching jobs.  Basically, I was finally living up to my potential.

Over the next year or so, sleeping 14-16 hours a day.  I rarely showered or left the house.  Started smoking cigarettes.  Bought drugs off the internet or abused over-the-counter products to try and replace my former medication.  **When you are huffing epinephrine or vicks inhalers to get enough energy to go to the grocery store, you know your life sucks.**

It was at this time that I discovered reddit, and a few other subs.  In between swapping stories, bitching about life, sharing support, and all that stuff, I learned a LOT.  About how bad the American medical establishment is with mental health.  How fucking hard it is to afford treatment/drugs.  How hypocritical some of our drug laws are.  I learned about neuroscience, chemistry, and philosophy.  I have folders upon folders of medical texts

**Where I'm at now:**
Life is OK these days.  As long as I can get my medication

But most of all, like everyone else, as this rotten system collapses under its own weight.

I'm done experimenting with drug regimens and treatments and all that.  This is who I am

So, goodbye r/depression.  You saw me through the worst of things.  The good news is that things are better; the bad news is that they are just OK. Thanks to those of you who take the time and energy to help others.

I'd also leave you with a warning.  I've seen many posts in recent days like ""I took a shower today""

Educate yourself, and you are the one that has to live with that mind.  Do keep an open mind, because some doctors DO know best... but figuring out which ones do is a tough job.  The ones that communicate with you and admit they don't have all the answers, and work *with* you are usually the best.  Think of a psychiatrist/psychologist as a consultant.  (Who, for better or worse, has the key to the medicine cabinet.)

Finally, an hour, a day, or a week.  But then go back to the fight until you get a satisfactory outcome.  Good luck yall, I'm out.",,False,t5_2qqqf,True

I hope this serves as a wake-up call that it’s impossible to detect the difference between depression and justifiable sadness if you don’t truly know what depression is. The state of life that is absolute fucking misery seems completely normal. The brain is cleverer than words can describe in how well it can play tricks on the mind. Societal stigmas being what they are, it’s likely that they have depression which has gotten to a severe stage, in which case you should probably send them the “How You Feel is a Lie” link and encourage them to seek medical help. Of course, if they don’t happen to be depressed it could be pretty offensive to insinuate that they are, so it should just be labeled as an interesting article you came across. The other symptoms such as not having interest in things are much harder to be aware of, since they will essentially hide the fact from anyone. For the past couple months I’ve basically been a really good actor, since I myself didn’t even know I was acting. And there’s probably a fair amount of other people out there who don’t know they’re acting either.

If someone thinks that depression is just an extended sadness for people who can’t deal with their challenges, unbeknownst to me at the time, had little grounding in the real world. But my brain is a real asshole and it flooded my consciousness with feelings of loneliness and inadequacy to provide me with actual concrete justification for the sadness. Keep in mind that this was only a mild case of depression. I could still my feelings of hopelessness and negativity somewhat in check by reassuring myself that I was going somewhere in life that I was smart and high achieving. At [college], surrounded by geniuses and Olympians, that became a whole lot harder to do. Then shit started snowballing. Hugely oversimplified, it’s a vicious cycle that goes like this:

1 Asshole brain creates feelings of sadness/emptiness for no reason

2 Mind indulges delusions of loneliness

3 Depletes energy, and confidence

4 Leads to decreased performance in reality

5 Hopelessness and inadequacy are more easily justifiable

6 Depression worsens (actual chemical imbalance worsens itself

Repeat over a few years and it breaks a person.

Between each step is a myriad of complicating thoughts and ups and downs. I mean… many years of life are happening over this time. But in short, haven’t really found any noteworthy research on the effects of mild depression. Mildly depressed people can be quite lazy and those without depression can of course be quite motivated)

In the medium stages of depression

Once it becomes severe, I was drinking alcoholically and having some good times, but daily living was just hell. For me, this started about a month out from making an attempt. It was around this time when the feelings of guilt and shame accompanied the self-hatred. Looking at my life objectively, I thought I should be at least somewhat happy to be up at [college] with a good circle of friends and decent grades for a public schooled freshman. Thinking objectively about my situation, I knew I should’ve felt good about where I was at, and felt guilty for not feeling good about it. When it came to the point of beating myself up about beating myself up

A couple weeks later, life of any kind didn’t seem worth living. My self-hatred remained strong as ever but it was now accompanied by a hatred of life in general. Talking me out of it at this point would’ve been pretty much impossible. I didn’t even want hope. I used having a cold as a scapegoat for my excessive sleeping and I just faked some level of interest or happiness so as not to be questioned about it. I’d already made up my mind that suicide was the only option and it just took a couple weeks to build up the courage to actually try it. I’m not trying to say a person with a healthy brain can’t feel depressed to a certain extent. It’s natural to have insecurities or to live a sad and difficult life. Life can be hard, that’s just how it is. But if it ever gets to a point where one feels they’re out of options-and an objective viewpoint clearly suggests otherwise- they should know that it’s not natural and that it’s mostly treatable.

I’d really prefer that all this is kept on the low. I feel like it changes the kind of relationship I can have with a person if I don’t know them really well. I don’t want people to feel they have to be inauthentically kind or sympathetic. People should be allowed to genuinely hate me for who I am; I do the same for a healthy portion of people I come across. There shouldn’t be any sort of checklist for who people choose as their friends. If you like their company, but I feel it may be helpful if I wrap up with just a few key points.

-Behavioral changes are gradual, or the development of strong alcoholic tendencies (like drinking when nobody else is). That the same condition can manifest itself in completely opposite ends of the sleep/diet spectrum makes it especially tricky. Moreover, these tendencies aren’t surefire indicators of depression. But it’s worth looking into at the very least.

-When it comes to the point where a person is only a few weeks out from killing themselves, at least in the earliest cognitive manifestations of suicidal ideation.”

-Everything has been oversimplified to keep this within a reasonable page limit. Not even close to all depressed people (clinically or otherwise) actually attempt suicide, e.g. attention or sympathy. Such attempts are often preceded by subtle or not so subtle hinting of what’s to come and a highly dramatic and sappy fake suicide note. I’m now really grateful that I ended up in the 90% and that I did not seriously injure myself in the attempt, and I’m quite assured knowing that my family and friends are grateful too. For the first time in months, I don’t downright despise myself. And even though I’m bound to make a lot more mistakes and miss some opportunities in the coming years, I’ll take them in stride and move on. It’s perfectly fine to have regrets, so long as they’re used as learning experiences rather than devices with which to tear yourself apart over things that can’t be changed.",,self,,

When people tell me that I need to love myself before others will love me, then it is more hopeless than even I expected. I have to some how delve the empty recess of my love and try to love me, the person who dislikes me more than anyone else I know, before anyone else will? That is a daunting task to ask someone who is crippled by depression to try and accomplish.

See, some people get is it from relatives, some people get it from friends and relationships. It seems to me that in order to love oneself, one has to be shown that it is possible to love oneself. I think that there is usually some outside source that jump-starts each persons love generator. I have tried to love myself, but I never know if I am doing it right, or what it means, or how to sustain it, I fall back into a place where I don't feel loved with no one around to encourage me to continue.

I don’t think the average person understands just how difficult it is for someone suffering from depression to talk about it. How deep the fears go. The fear that the average person will either dismiss what the sufferer feels, or the worst: reject them for reaching out.

The sufferer always worries that what they need to talk about will seem so little to someone else

But sometimes

Even worse is when the sufferer finds someone they can talk to when they’re at their worst … and knowing that eventually

And then they do. And then they’re gone. And the sufferer has no one to blame … but themselves.

No one wants to be a burden on someone else, that person is no longer willing to listen because the sufferer is just once again going through the ‘same old thing’, not realizing that this ‘same old thing’ is really just a way of life for someone with depression.

Depression is an ongoing game of hide and seek. Hiding true feelings when someone asks how they are doing

And then there’s the shame. The sufferer’s shame in knowing that they’re not normal, but for some reason, they can’t. The shame of not knowing why.

And

It’s so much easier to be alone. To suffer in silence. To put on a brave face and just reply that you’re ‘fine’ whenever someone asks how you are doing. When you’re alone

The sufferer would rather hurt themselves than hurt someone else. Because even if they don’t think they’re important to that someone

And maybe they’ll do bad things that the average person cannot understand. Maybe they’ll find a razor blade and quickly slash it across their skin in hopes that the physical pain will drown out the mental anguish. Maybe they’ll do it to punish themselves; because why would anyone have bad thoughts unless they are a bad person?

Maybe they’ll do it because it’s easier

Maybe they’ll do it because they want someone to notice that they feel so badly on the inside that they’ve made it visible on the outside.

And the sufferer will end up feeling even more ashamed. Because they know they can’t do anything right. They can’t do anything ‘normal’.

It’s hard to talk to someone with depression; it’s hard not to just brush them off and tell them that everything will be okay, dismissed as nothing more than just a phase they need to ‘snap out of.’

If it was that easy

Depression is a cry for attention from someone who doesn’t want to be noticed. Depression is a soul-crushing blackness that’s hard to attribute to anything. Sufferers can laugh and still feel like they’re dying. Sufferers can have close friends that they love and still believe that the best thing they can do for these people they care so much about is to just disappear. That the greatest gift they can give someone is to remove themselves from their lives and no longer hold them back.

Sufferers don’t always feel, or that they could be important to someone else. How could anyone possibly love someone like them? They’re damaged goods.

And damaged goods aren’t useful to anyone. Damaged goods are just taking up space. Damaged goods need to be discarded.

The sufferer doesn’t always want to die so much as they want to live

Suicide is the greatest selfish gift the sufferer can give. The sufferer doesn’t want to be a burden all the while knowing that all they want is for someone, someone they’ve opened their soul to, to just hold them and tell them that you know things aren’t okay right now, but someday, they will be. To tell them that while they may not understand, they want to. To tell them that they’re too important to lose. To tell them that they’ll try to help, and mean it. To help them try to believe you.

Someone suffering from depression is afraid of snuffing out the light of hope by pulling it too close, loving it too much, until finally, one day, they open their hands and find that the light has gone out.

Because

And they feel they have no one else to blame but themselves. It’s always their fault. It’s always because they’re broken. The next light they see may be the one they’re finally afraid to reach out to

They feel they are nothing but an infection in the life of someone meaningful and

No one misses an infection. No one will miss the person spreading their disease

Not everyone understands that even gray clouds might long for the sun.

All the sufferer wants is to be normal. Praying to a god they have no reason to believe in for something to change. Longing to feel what the average person feels. To know what happiness may be. To just not hurt anymore for no reason at all. To finally no longer be a burden. To accept that most times

The answers that the friend of a sufferer needs is that whenever you may hate them the most

And the sufferer will hate themselves for needing you more than you’ll ever know.

and the echoes in the darkest corners of my brain.

my movement forward is fleeting

in the scope of time and space

but to me

I long for the comfort of stillness

even if the impact crushes

and destroys my soul. I will cry out from the pain

and I will be heard

in hopes of being caught. I will race toward the earth

however slowly

in acceptance of my fate.

necessary to keep myself erect

myself from the insides out

**Edit 6: Most games have gone now unfortunently

Dear friends of /r/depression


As many of you know life sucks


Now the issue with this will be that many people that do need it feel that they maybe do not deserve it


Now, let this be a happy place. It is also not a competion of who feels worse, suffering is bad in itself and there is no need to think that you are not deserving because ""others have it worse"". It is after all a symptom of the disease.


So the games that I decided to give away are ones that I've played and enjoyed(or in some cases owned extra copies off and those were the ones that inspired this giveaway).


And remember, do not think you don't deserve it, and even if I cannot afford to give everyone a game, I can give you some tips on games that you might enjoy if you'd like!

Here are the games that I currently have to giveaway

~~1 copy of Left for Dead 1~~

~~1 copy of Borderlands 2(won't be out until around the 20th of september


~~1 copy of Wanderlust~~

~~1 copy of Bioshock 1~~

1351560975.0,12bapl,I found my roommate after he committed suicide and I need help. First post btw.,bluegrassjams,168,25,42,"I need help

I am 19 years old. Last year was my first year at college. I have always wanted to be a veterinarian, I was making straight A's; academically, extracurricularly, physically, socially, and i guess you could even say sexually. I was excited to be independent, I had a real oppportunity to make something of myself!

My roommate was JC. He was a computer science major, a fellow redditor, and my friend. JC was an open minded and open hearted individual, he struggled with family issues earlier in his life, family alcoholism and divorce were a large part of his childhood. This, I believe left him introverted and clinging to only his close group of friends from home. As far as our campus went, i think i was the only person who really got to know JC and I'm thankful, confused

The year was going well

The Thursday after we got back from Spring break I was sitting in my room relaxing before I surrendered to the library for the night. JC got out of class early so we were able to sit back and listen to some music. He loved Pink Floydd, I had a big test coming up, after all. I came home from the library about 3-4 hours later, it doesn't make a difference. When i came back to my dorm room that night the light was on inside but the door was locked. I unlocked it and walked inside, the place looked empty. I began to make my way over to my desk to put my backpack and things away. Half way across the room, in between our beds I stopped. There were four notes on JC's bed. The foremost one had my name on it, the others were addressed to whom I understood were his closest friends. I ripped mine open skimmed it and thought it was some sort of fucked up joke, and then I checked under the bed. He warned me not to, i still thought he was fucking with me. That's the first time i've ever shared that part of the story. 

Now my life has not been peaceful. I'm third generation of an angrily successful irish american family family at odds with each other. Bipolarism runs through my veins like the hurricane floods currently running through streets all up and down the NE Coast. I've probably had a few more negative experiences in my life than the average 19 year old, is burned into my skull. I really don't say this to brag, anyone experiencing something similar to this knows it's not something to brag about, but I need you to know where I'm coming from.

Well, i sat at a table and through my sporadic shaking and tears answered whatever questions the police and counselors asked. I tried to act like it was something I could get past.

I was so convinced that I could handle it

This past summer I kept myself busy with work, that I realized the impacts this has had on me.

I cant think clearly, have been lesser recently but still so vivid. I think people have noticed too. i used to be the life of the party and now i have FUCKED UP tattooed across my face. That's not to say I get out and have fun, like I said I'm trying to be better. I still exercise, study, go out and try to keep a healthy lifestyle. I still consider myself an ambitious person but I can tell that these ambitions are derived, at times, from mania and depression. Early in the semester I decided that I needed help and began seeing a psychologist at Student Counseling Services, bipolar disorder

I have trouble sleeping

I have difficulty with intimacy, but she doesn't know that that's because I was numb and in a different place entirely. I couldn't keep that or any of my other relationships together, there has been a lot of meaningless sex trying to fill something. I want a woman I can share myself with but eventually they always get past my charisma and recognized how fucked up i am. All my friends have been extraordinary but they have their busy lives and cant listen to my problems every day. I need a relationship with someone who cares enough to stick around that way. I want someone who I can hold and feel love for but i haven't felt that for a long time now.

I also get angry frequently and feel a tremendous amount of guilt for it. My upbringing taught me to place blame intrinsically for just about everything. Which I believe is the root of my anxiety. I lose my temper and hit myself in the head often, i don't fully know how anyone who has been touched by suicide could be, but often I think the only way to get rid of these memories is for me to go away. I need to know how to deal with them. My nails are down to the nub and have been for a long time. I never just feel happy, I used to. I think the traumatic experience just pushed me over the edge and I want to find that person I used to be, but I'm scared he was stolen. Being away from home makes all this more difficult but I need to continue moving towards vet school.

Emotions are difficult for me, he said there was no reason, he knew i would be the one to find him. BUT WHY DID HE HAVE TO DO THIS TO ME? did he think i wouldn't care? I do care, and that's what has messed with me so much. please help.

Thanks for listening

&gt; I am going to share something on facebook that may fundamentally change the way you look at me. I am not doing this to bring attention to myself

&gt; I wanted to share this with you all to showcase the reality of suicide in our society. It is very real and not talked about enough. Not enough at risk people will get the care they need


&gt; But there are things you can do to help. Simple things. 


&gt; Take a little extra time to be nice to someone, listen to people without planning what you are going to say next, smile. The little things give people hope, and make this confusing world a little bit easier to live in. 

&gt; Most importantly though, talk about it tomorrow, and continue talking about it. Depression is always present in a person’s life, but it doesn't have to control them. Do your part, help someone out, and don’t be afraid.

So now I want to write this just to i dunno... maybe put some hope in at least someone. 

I've been battling depression since I was 16, Venlafaxine, Carbamazepine, Clozapine, Olanzapine) because I had different diagnoses with time. To make the story short, 2 years ago I had the worst depression ever... feeling like a pice of shit, not caring about the future, nothing matter to me at that point. Had a bunch of pills and my mother and sister found me  and  they took me to the hospital.  I stayed in the mental facility for one week till I got more stable. 
I was really angry at everyone.. including myself.. because I failed my attempt and because they saved my life. Spending time in the hospital made me realize how fortunate I was, try to make my life beautiful again, it was a long process and im still a work in progress! 

So it was therapy, get away from bad relationships, and focus on getting my bachelor degree in marine biology. It's a long way, Im not here to tell you what I did, because It probably won't work for you, because the beauty of this is trying to find your own path, to discover that there is more to live for... Somehow we are in this world, but at least we can change and love ourselves.

The thing is... im about to get married in a couple of hours with the most amazing guy in the galaxy! and I know I still feel like crap every on and then

I haven't really found a healthy way of coping with my depression

Growing up I had a good life, but I never let that get in the way of getting involved in school, my community, my church, etc. What I'm getting at is that I've always have had people around me that care about me and would do anything for me. I have friends, I have family, and yet I feel so alone. 

Currently I'm a college senior and will be graduating in may with a pretty good future ahead of me.

Here's where the problem is. Lately I've been so depressed it's a struggle to get out of bed. It's a struggle to go to class and do my assignments. And it's a struggle to care about my job. 

But I have no reason to be depressed. 

When my friends notice something is wrong, because that is something they can relate to and understand. 

I live near train tracks and can't shake the thought of taking a nap on the tracks. 

I can't share this with my friends though because they would freak and not know how to respond. I can't share this with my family because there is a strong history of suicide and depression in my family and I don't want to add to their worries. 

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to cope with depression because I can't reach out to my friends because they don't understand

After quite a few terrible things had happened to me recently, it'd be this subreddit. So, why don't we make friends here? I'm fully aware we're a depressed mobs and sometimes two depressed person can't help each other. What if I can't/don't make another person feel any better? But well, if life is so shitty now anyway, what else do we have to lose?

Let's start by commenting on this thread to show you're interested. Just write a bit information about yourself, talk, and make friends. Let's try actively seeking out for friends and for something more than just a once-off off-my-chest chat.


Let me start, socially awkward penguin (social anxiety).

I like to think I'm the male version of Amelie in the movie Amelie, or Mr. Darcy (without being rich or handsome- just the awkwardness and being misunderstood part I guess). And sometimes, I'm just a DOG.

I play Starcraft 2 a bit


**EDIT 2:** I hope you all make some friends. The most important thing is keep it going, of course unless it really did not go well.

I thought of doing this in a more organised way.. but let's see how you guy like this idea.

**EDIT 3** Thank everyone for your interest. As this thread is getting long. We're thinking if we should start a new subreddit.. Well, we need a strict guideline and proper dedicated mod. If any of you feel you are up to it, feel free to start one.

**EDIT 4:** This is the internet so please do exercise caution when making friends with strangers. Hope you all have some fun. 

**EDIT 5:** Many of you like having a group rather than just 1:1 and do Skype Group or video chat. By all means, make an bold **EDIT** if you have posted already.

And

**EDIT 6:** This thread is about 1 day old, let's add images and links to your post. Nice photos you took of ~~yourself~~ (I'm not sure about this), your pets, landscapes.. or artwork, anything cool you made and want to show off. Links to your blogs, music you created etc.

DON'T put up your photo with you in it if you are Ridiculously Photogenic Guy! You'd make everyone feel insecure! :)

Do these descriptions fit you

I think too much

How can any of the stupid shit I do possibly matter when people are hurting each other

What if it's not an imbalance in our brain? What if it's not whatever the therapist says it is? Our overly complex, the food that we eat - we become tiny cogs in an infinite machine, and that is why we feel purposeless. How can anything you do matter, when you're a part of something so huge and ugly?

(edit: [here's a pretty (in my opinion) landscape to help break up my wall'o'text](http://i.imgur.com/40hW1.jpg))

We are not MEANT to be one of a million puzzle pieces. In most jobs today

The bigger the system, too much injustice, how can one person expect to help? So no one does, because we all feel helpless. 

I think we are meant to be in small, where you can grow your own fucking carrots and eat them and feel responsible for your own welfare instead of having to rely on so many other people. And if someone in your community is lacking, you can help them, face to face, and know that you made a difference in their lives.

We are not happy because our society is unnatural

1337792677.0,u18vb,Depressed? Unhappy?  Read this...,lolwut314,164,39,28,"...I was too.

I thought my life was going nowhere.  I had trouble in college.  I felt like I didn't have any close friends.  I didn't know where my life was heading.  I was unhappy, took meds, etc..

I was a stressed out anxious young adult male from basically the age of 15 to 22.  I'm going to give you a few tips to help you through things, and I 100% knew it wasn't going to get better.

...Well I was wrong.  It will improve.  It may not be perfect

**Tip #1** - Life is like the stock market.  There are high points and there are low points.  I've had many low points like I'm sure you have had.  Remember, you do have value. People will buy you, people will sell you, and you may need to make some difficult choices and reinvest in some different paths in life.  That's also what makes life so damn fun.  You are the stock broker at the end of the day, and **you** control it.    

**Tip #2** - ""Look at things from a far away distance"" ....confusing right?  Trust me, looking down at whatever current situation or interaction is making me feel this way.  That ""looking at it from a distance"" helps my brain realize this little process of worrying, anxiety, or feeling of worthlessness isn't the end of the world.  It's a tiny speed bump in life.  The more you can train your brain to keep things in perspective, the more it helps.

I'm now in my late 20's.  I have a girlfriend I thought I'd never have, and a combination of other enjoyable things...

...And you know what - when I hit my 30's, My friends may move, etc.. But I'm not worrying about it.  My stock will turn around again, because I'm the one that's buying and selling it the way I want to do it.",,False,self,False,t3_u18vb

(Huge wall of text warning.)",1005fft,147,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1flttj/i_fear_that_im_broken_and_quite_probably_beyond/, and hope against hope that someone will say something that helps me. I want to say up front I have been under the care of 13 different psychiatrists, and even after going through the courses exactly as described

So, the youngest of three. My older siblings are productive and fine - however we don't speak (more on that later.) My parents divorced when I was 6, however I never really had issues dealing with it. They lived 6 blocks away, were friendly and helped each other for years, and we were allowed to move freely between them with no problems. 

I was relatively popular in elementary school, or at least have the aptitude for it. My first IQ test was when I was in 2nd grade, and I have had 7 since - I've never scored below the 160s. The only thing I struggled with in school was behavioral issues. I finished my class work quickly and would talk and get in trouble for interrupting other students who were not done yet. This started a damning trend with my teachers however. As the years went by, I found myself in trouble more and more often (and the out of school/in school suspensions started racking up). I wasn't attacking or abusing anyone, and I wasn't a bully. I was constantly in trouble for not following directions (like talking when I wasn't supposed to be, as mentioned before), and as I got in more and more trouble at school I became the scapegoat for any problem near me. At first I welcomed this role

This however followed me to Jr. High school, and when a week later I was suspended for 10 days for damaging school property (a window was broken on the 3rd floor of our school, and I was with 2 teachers at the time, who vouched for me, yet the principal still suspended me and claimed I did it.) I simply stopped doing school work. I would go to school every day, and any assignment in any class that I received, I'd simply write my name, and 0/F at the top of the paper

I failed 7th grade, which boiled down to my SAT score being so high that the board had decided something was going on, and were willing to give me a second chance. 8th grade miserable, the teachers hated me - they had failed me and couldn't understand why I was back. I didn't do a single piece of classwork my entire 8th grade year. I hated being at school, I hated being in class, I was miserable - this is when I first started thinking about suicide. 

My parents were divorced by this time, before my parents, and spend a few hours sitting alone in my room with a pistol, unloaded, pulling the trigger against my head over and over - trying to convince myself it wasn't scary. At the end of the school year, finally, I thought it would be over.

The board of education and my parents decided I had a learning disability, still in the 160s, and my placement tests placed me at the college level, there was much confusion. This is also when I began seeing psychiatrists, it was obvious to everyone something was wrong. When I was 14, I completed my placement tests, I required one class (trigonometry) in a classroom setting

During that time, because she'd get trashed at the bar and drive home. I was accepted to several universities on full ride scholarships based on my SAT/ACT scores that year. However my parents refused to let me leave town to go to school, because I was so young. I lived at home, and started at a local university. I thought the worst was behind me.

I lasted less than 2 years in college, and I didn't fit in at college because I was too young. When I started getting too depressed to focus, I started failing my classes. My mom also started to give me encouraging little tidbits when she'd drop me off at the campus every morning. She was furious that I was failing yet again, and so constantly would tell me things like - you might as well not even try, you're going to fail. So I listened, I quit trying, I quit going

I spun downward quickly, my own apartment, and a girl I'd been head over heels in love with for 6-7 years (she was my best friends girlfriend, so I of course never made it known before hand, but after they broke up - it turned out she had always liked me too, supposedly.) She wasn't my first girlfriend/sexual partner, but she was the one I always wanted. I was 22-23 and things were going great.

Less than a month after we started dating, my dad collapsed and I took him to the ER. The following day, christmas day, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and estimated at a year to live. He died 23 days later. I've always hated that he had to go so early in my life. He said something pretty hurtful to me after I dropped out of college, that he 'rememberd when he was proud of me'. It was something he regretted saying, he apologized for it many many times, but to this day it's all I can think of when I think of my dad. Because he's right, unlike his other children - I was the failure. This of course put a heavy weight on me

Three months later came the biggest shock of my life. I was woken at 6:30 am to the police at the door with a search warrant. I was about to find out I was being arrested/charged with distributing child porn (something I've never done in my life), and all my friends were in college, no one had a home phone, and you couldn't call cell phones from the jail. It took a week before I finally caught my boss at home, who found my sister on facebook, to contact my mom, who came to bail me out. My bond was 100,000$ cash to get me out)

What followed was the most demoralizing endeavor I've ever been a party to. I did not meet the requirements for a public defender (you have to make less than 400$ a month...),000 and 250,000$ to take the case. It took every penny I had to my name, my mom had to her name, and my stepdad had to his name, to get a lawyer on the case (I still owe him 16,000$ today.)

The prosecutor offered me plea deals for the next year, 15 years. I had a preliminary hearing where the detective flat out lied about our interview, and claimed I said things that I never did - I told my attorney, who brought it up. The judge refused the line of questioning, because it was a 'preliminary hearing, and those are facts for trial', and refused to allow the tape of the interview to be played for him. The judge and prosecutor, launched a verbal tirade against me

When that didn't work, and my attorney wasn't sent a copy. Of course I didn't show up to court, and the US Marshals arrested me at my job for failure to appear. Now everyone who didn't know already knew, and I was in jail on a no-bond charge. It took 3 weeks for my lawyer to convince a judge to let me back out. This is when the great shedding of ""friends"" occured.

Now that everyone knew the charge against me, which turned into a river. My SO couldn't handle the flak she was getting from people, and although she'd stuck by me for 2 years of it - she left for the comfort of one of her friends who'd been helping her deal with it. After another year, I was done. I couldn't fight anymore, I left my job, defaulted on everything, was evicted, where 7 months later - they sent a letter informing me that during the process of setting up my actual trial dates, all of my friends and family (my brother and sister stopped speaking to me after my arrest

As I sat reading the letter from them, but it didn't come. Nothing did, and nothing has since. I got my job back at my previous employer, they are the only person who will hire me. Every other interview I get extended a job and then fail the background check (my arrest still shows up, the court refuses to remove it until 10 years has passed, and a direct quote from the solicitor here, 'because people deserve to know what you were suspected of, when you see a charge about sexual abuse of a minor, anything. That's it

I now work from home, and I was innocent of from the beginnig. I've gained 130lbs, I don't go outside, I have no friends and no drive to make friends. I can't quit smoking, drinking, eating shit food, nothing. I tried hard drugs, I tried therapy. I'm at my wits end.

I don't leave my house because I'm ashasmed of how I look, but I've said that every day for the last 2 years, I never do. I'm so broken that I have no willpower, no motivation, no nothing. I'm terrified to make friends because I don't want to explain my past, and because I'm convinced they will be taken away again. I've lost all my friends twice now, and have truly been betrayed and abandoned by every person that I've ever loved. I can't get past it having to be me. There has to be something wrong with me that I can't function correctly. The few friends I managed to keep through the ordeal I've lost since, and I've lost the ability to pretend to be happy anymore.

I don't even know what I expect by posting this. I've taken the medicine, and nothing is helping me. I am a prisoner in my own mind, and I'm so tired of it.

1368629366.0,1edv5k,Isn't it interesting that people find comfort in the knowledge that those who have attempted suicide have immediately regretted it?,ReticentRaccoon,147,25,44,"There are stories of people who have attempted suicide and have immediately regretted it. A person tries to hang themself

I feel that it is regular people, and not just by everyone else, but also specifically by the person who attempted it. For them to imagine anything else would be a threat to their worldview. To even consider that in some situations suicide may be legitimate is a grave danger to their belief that life is worth living at all costs. To try to understand and emphasize with the thoughts of a suicidal person would drive them to the edge of insanity. It seems as if these people have a heightened predisposition to selectively pay attention and spread stories such as these because it brings them comfort. ""Of course they regretted it! It could be no other way. World order is restored!""

Myself, the human survival instinct is extremely strong. We spend our whole lives not dying, and we ourselves are the legacy of millions of generations of other living beings that have spent their entire lives trying not to die. The thought of not existing is incredibly terrifying, as is the thought of the physical pain the transition would entail. In that view, the act of suicide - the deliberate decision and the follow-through action - is incredibly courageous. Is it really all that strange that once the decision is made irrevocable, the person immediately regrets it and struggles against it? That doesn't make the decision itself illegitimate or make all the reasons that led up to it suddenly disappear. And yet the regular people use the fact of the struggle as evidence that the person didn't *really* want to kill themselves in the first place. They find comfort in the illusion that no such reason could exist.

The other reason to be wary is survivorship bias. Those people who survived long enough after their first attempt to tell their tale are precisely those who are more likely to have changed their mind than the people who have tried again soon afterward and are no longer around to justify themselves. There are stories of the second kind too though, but these are not as popular, or are even outright [censored](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cdon5/called_depression_hotline_closed_called_suicide/c9g53bw).

So, for maybe I *want* these stories to be false, to justify my *own* worldview. Is there a way to discuss suicide without cached thoughts and preconceptions, without trying to escape into comforting platitudes? Is there a way to deliberate whether life is worth living without presupposing the answer to begin with?

I have always been extremely anxious and stressed out, but all internally, I never cared
My parents divorced when I was 6 months old. My mom stopped doing meth when I was 1

When I was twelve, investing a lot in my physical appearance, and slept around a lot.

**My room had rotting apple cores, dirty clothes everywhere, sheets that had been on my bed for months. I even found a rat nest nestled into my clothes, with baby rats curled up. I would go weeks without showering or leaving the house, never going outside or speaking to anybody unless I absolutely had to.
I got into a relationship that I was in for two years that was extremely verbally and mentally abusive. He wanted to build muscle and I wanted to lose weight
I weighed 85 pounds when I was admitted to a mental hospital and first put on medication. 
That medication sort of helped
After I got out of treatment
I also never really felt things, but acted afraid and started crying because that's what a ""normal person"" would do, right?**

I eventually met this guy named Trevor and started sleeping with him. We slept together more and more, so he did. At this point, we were kinda close, but I still felt cut off, and too anxious to actually have a friend I was comfortable around. Him living in my house was good and things around the house improved a lot. My dad didn't want to show his real self in front of Trevor, so he stopped breaking dishes and yelling and saying awful things to us. He'd still do it if Trevor wasn't around, but it was pretty pleasant in the house for the most part. 
Trevor and I continued to get closer and he was planning a trip to Europe and invited me. I had been saving up money so I decided to go
In Europe we got extremely close and I felt like I had a friend for the first time
When we got back, who Trevor knew from college. He jokingly asked us to replace his room mate who was moving out, and I was dying to get out of my dad's horrible household and away from his abuse, so I said we should do it.
Trevor was uneasy about just packing up his whole life
We moved in with his friend and it was fun, who dropped out of high school in tenth grade.
I still felt incredibly anxious and depressed, not that well. 
After a few months of living in our new home
**I got irritated super easily all the time
Things continued in this fashion, instead praying for a terminal disease or a brain tumor that was inoperable so I could die without it being my fault. 
I cried every day
My psychiatrist upped my dosage but it didn't do anything
My new doctor immediately put me on a different medication and gave me meds for my ADD. 
Within three weeks
I started recognizing my good qualities
""Oh
Stuff like that.
I quit my shitty job and got a better one
I am absolutely in love with my boyfriend. We have amazing sex almost every day

**I'm not ""cured"" and still have my old psychological issues
I still feel socially anxious and don't have ""real friend"" friends
I love myself and am hopeful for my future
Amazed by the beauty of nature and determined to constantly better myself and do anything I can to be exactly who I want to be.
I refuse to ever go back to living in mediocrity or the putrid pit of depression. I don't allow anyone to do anything bad to me, or try to get away with some bullshit.
I'm not going to sit here and just wait to die. I'm alive and life is beautiful. Life is the greatest gift you will EVER receive and you can do anything you want with it.**

I love meeting new people, but after forcing myself into online gaming and trying to strike up conversation with someone in a cooperative atmosphere, it's become easier and easier.

I want to meet *you*.  My friend(s) and I want to game with you.  I would like to gift you a game--currently, and Shoot Many Robots (never played this one)--and spend this evening playing it, the three of us.  Maybe four, if someone else wants in.  Hell, I'll stream it on twitch.tv if the community wants to join in or observe.

We will laugh and have fun.  We will kill zombies.  Or psychos.  Or robots.  When you accidentally shotgun me in the face I'll spit my drink out laughing.  You'll have this game forever and we will play it again in the future.

The only thing I ask of you is to remember one time where you played video games and had fun, so you don't have to submit the best or funniest story to be picked, but I do want to read your experiences, if you don't mind.

I've also created a [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CatharticGaming) so we can start getting together as often as possible.  I hope to provide some game gifts to the community, Team Fortress 2 is free to play and a wonderfully cooperative game.  What's better than hiding behind a heavy as a medic?!  Nothing!

It seems to be common consensus that one should not stick his dick in crazy. Simple rule right? But what about being the crazy dick sheath? I am the crazy dick sheath. 

I have never been to a shrink or anything, mope for weeks. See a homeless person with malnourished dog, mope for weeks. I don't know if it's normal but I'm guessing not. My SO gets it the worst. If he even goes out without me once I will be entirely convinced that he will cheat on me and leave me. He has never done anything to warrant my behaviour and suspicions but there is nothing he or I can do to convince my brain otherwise. Every time he is out without me I am practically crippled with ""hurt"" and am in tears in bed crying until the moment he comes home. And when he does I will be absolutely difficult and give him grief for weeks on end. During my good days I understand that he needs time with his friends and I know he will never hurt me. But when it comes down to it again I am the same crazy sobbing wreck that can't live without him by my side. He has since tried to never leave my side but I know that makes him unhappy and I don't want that either. Needless to say, I'm losing him.

Oh and that I torture him and myself by self-harming.I want to say that it's not something I can help but that's simply ridiculous. Of course I can help it.I can just NOT pick up the razor and cut myself. Right? Unfortunately my stupid brain doesn't process it the same way. It's a compulsion and almost an addiction. I think about it all day everyday every minute and I hate hate hate the scars and I hate how pathetic it makes me feel. Cutting yourself is for 16 year old tumblr girls

I know most of you, but I'm asian, and living in my culture it is considered the deepest shame to seek mental healthcare and it is not something I am ready to explore. I'm not asking for help here either, I guess. Just needed a space where people can understand what I'm going through.

Sorry for the rant. Nothing makes any sense right now but thank you for listening.

hello. I just spoke to my SO and asked for a breakup. It's something that has been going through my mind and tonight I finally told him. He said okay

I tried to kill myself on Sunday

But here's one part that my research never told me:  your mind drifts far away from you after you take that much shit.  I apparently dialed the boy that refused to date me and I cried and I moaned.  I don't remember what he was saying to me at the time but I know it sounded more genuine than anything he said to me while he had just wanted to fuck me.  He cried with me.

I was still wearing the red dress and push-up bra from the Christmas party in my house the night before. I started to throw up at this point and I noticed within the first three expulsions that the two Claritin came up entirely in tact:  failure.  Slow metabolism has always been a problem for me.

The next 24 hours were so awful that they would've made me reconsider, vitals taken, charcoal beverage.  And then my personal phobia:  blood tests.  Blood tests every fucking hour.  Each time I screamed so loudly that everyone in the waiting room could hear.

When I wasn't getting blood tests I was puking

I actually started enjoying my single life for a couple months and didn't even think about women. Just went out to have a good time with the guys. Often times they were hitting on women and I'd come make conversation but had no interest in even exchanging numbers.

Well the last few weeks that started to change. I'm ready for a relationship again. So I've been going out more trying the bar scene. But I seemed to have lacked the courage to actually do more than make idle conversation with a woman.

Tonight was finally different. A few friends and I went to the bar after shooting some pool and drinking quite a bit (we walked don't worry.) Well this combination of a bunch of guys + liquor apparently brought the testosterone in me again. We were talking

Well this number ended up being fake. But honestly. While it hurt to be rejected on my first real attempt back in the game. It feels so much better to have actually given it a go. I had a great night

http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/

To make a long back story short, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.

Fast forward a couple more days, she was trying to follow her veins ""to see if she could even feel it"". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook

The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.

I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way

This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.

After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.

After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.

At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day

Last Sunday my brother got into an argument with my mother. We'll call him Sam, and him having to ride his bike 10 miles to my dad's house. That day my mom yelled bloody murder at me. She hit me. To be honest, I can't fully remember everything she said. My mind blocks it out. But what I do remember is basically being told that I was worthless, I was wrong, and I didn't do anything right. It got to the point where she was yelling at me, then her stupid boyfriend was yelling at me, and I was just crying. I ended up going into the bathroom and cutting myself. I rarely cut myself. Last summer was the last time I did. She drives me to it. Last summer every day I was crying as she spit out words of abuse. She'll scream at me, a bitch

The next day I had to go work, I love him, and I'm not going to ostracize her like my mom, her boyfriend, and my little brother. So I sit with him. Later I go inside and I'm eating cake. I try to bring some out to my brother and my mom flips out. She and her boyfriend yell at me that I'm ""undermining her authority"" and other crazy shit. She tells me she's so ""sick of me"" and she can't handle me ""bullying"" her. She makes me pack my things, takes away my phone and car keys, and drives me and Sam to my dads. 

Now my dad lives in a shitty house. He has a couple other really ghetto roommates. The house is falling apart and filthy. He has some financial issues and he goes without eating good meals quite often. Most weekends we can't visit him because he can't afford it. So we go over there and his shower and toilet aren't working and he has no food. So he drives us back over and tells my mom he really just cannot take us. My mom is pissed that we're back and she makes us sleep outside. Is that legal?? She fucking made me and Sam sleep outside on the fucking grass. Now my dad would've driven right back and taken us if he knew

In the morning when we woke up we tried going inside but my mom wouldn't let us. So I changed my clothes in the front yard because I just didn't fucking care at that point and walked a few blocks and had my friend pick me up. She's a damn saint. By the way, and spend the night at my friend's. The next day we went home and she finally let us in after a long talk with my dad. But she went to the police. She told them a twisted story about how my brother and I ""bully"" my mom and she just couldn't handle us anymore and it ended up with the cop agreeing that it was legal for her to leave us outside. He told her to call them next time and they would pick us up and put us into foster care if she couldn't handle us. The whole time her stupid boyfriend is defending her and telling her to call the cops on us and whatnot.

Now this is so frustrating. I can't even describe it fully. Because I am NOT a bad kid. I get good grades, I drive my brothers everywhere, I do all the grocery shopping. Since I began driving I've taken over the role of mother. By the time I was 6 my mom stopped giving a shit. Our house was filthy. There was so much shit in out house that you couldn't walk around. The floors were grimy and matted with spilled food and drink. The table and sink overflowed with dishes full of rotting food and maggots. She never cooked us dinner. Since I was six I've been eating whatever I can find around the house and when I got old enough I cleaned the house so that it wasn't a dump anymore. Now my mom has a routine of go to work, come home, grab a beer, head straight to her bedroom, sleep. She doesn't come out to talk to us, or helps with dishes, I buy their friend's birthday gifts and take them to the parties. I cook food, I just make sure everything is running. I'm constantly stressed with my home life and on top of that I'm extremely involved with school and so I'm always always stressed. Driving has been such a blessing because I can go out and buy myself clothes and food when I/my family needs it. She won't even buy me clothes. Everything I have I buy for myself. She will  go out and spend hundreds on clothes for herself but when I ask for jeans or a coat she tells me ""No

So please. Imagine how frustrating it is when I practically run our household and then I'm berated constantly. I do everything I possibly can and yet I'm told that I'm a bitch, lazy, that I never listen, I'm irresponsible, I'm good for nothing.

It was then that I looked down at my laptop and my notebook and realised I was genuinely taking notes on how to kill myself. I was planning it right down to the minute detail

I view my depression as a very large lake with a small island in the middle... it's always dark and dismal there

The island is where you start. You generally spend your time sleeping or doing nothing. Occasionally other people will come floating by on small rafts, but there's never any room for you on their boat and the mainland is not visible from the island; you can't swim in the water and you don't have your own boat, so you eventually pass off that dream as a lost cause as well. 

Some people spend their entire life on this island, as to not annoy or inconvenience the passer-bys. 

If you're lucky and your message does make it to someone, and sometimes backfires; getting people too close to the water than they're prepared for. You try it, you feel as though there's nothing left to lose, so why not give it a chance, right? 

One day you look out	at the water and it doesn't look the same... there's a film of white on the top of it- something must be happening

It's cold. 

Taking a chance, giving way to the murky black bilge. You fall in and feel like you're drowning; the rushing current pulling you further and further away from your destination. 

In a flash, that can't be right, there's more out there than just the island, and you want to experience it. You take some time to gather yourself and prepare to try again. 

Running back on to the icy coating, but you want to get to the mainland.

1359011760.0,176ges,I feel like a monster.,damnedemptybottle,114,13,45,"I'm writing this on my throwaway account because the things I want to say are things that I don't even want my closest friend

I've been depressed since I was about 13. I shrugged it off as just hormones and ageing, but did not include the part where there was penetration. My counselor is the only person I told about this.

The previous paragraph has led to some of my depression. When my sister's first child was born(years after we stopped) she was living in another state. My family and I went to visit so we could be around the new baby. All the time we were there, she thought I would want that with her child.

In High School I had met a few friends. I went to a christian school. My mom decided I should go there, and this became a recurring topic. The were times the guys at the school would want to see it, just to see how small it was and not in a gay way, so we go in the bathroom and I'd show them. The second year of high school there was this really annoying kid that nobody liked, except the principal. He would always get in my place and I did nothing. One day he started punching me, and right as I shove him off of me, the principal comes down the stairs and sees me push him. I get ISS

It was also during my second year that my grades went down. I passed senior high with ease

Fast forward to me in college. I went to college out of state, it took me a bit to warm up to them there, but eventually I was back at my old habits of streaking through the dorms, sack-tagging people, and generally being a lazy asshole who didn't go to classes. I had a group of friends that I hung out with, and even with them I was expected to be the asshole...so that's what I was.

The group of friends I had tolerated me, I feel I have no friends, and really I don't, I am sleeping non-stop, not doing any homework, not going to classes, hardly eating but overeating when I do. I thought I was at my lowest point. One night I even cried myself sick. I started drinking, but the only reason I drank was to try and escape myself.

I eventually failed out of that college and moved home to attend the local one. I started taking anti-depressants and they worked,000 in debt and had nothing to show for it. And on top of that, both times I failed out I lied to her and said I was doing fine. That went well until they sent certified mail that told of my failures. My mom was so upset, both angry and sad, because she knew I could do better, but I never told her of the depression I felt.

After I failed out of college a second time, living off of the parent loan refund my mom let me have. I eventually got a job and all was well. Then I started drinking again. This time it was copious amounts in short intervals. I drank because I hated myself and didn't have the courage to get help. Through all of this I never harmed myself physically, but there were plenty of suicidal thoughts.

Eventually things fell apart with my roommate, but I felt as if my best friend no longer wanted me around, so I came home. I decided to try and re-enroll in college back at home. I was/am 24 and had to fight to get my gpa up above a 2.0 last semester. Since I felt as if my best friend didn't want me, I had already failed college twice, and I was back home living with my parents, I felt at an all time low. I finally sought help from a doctor and a counselor. I have been on meds since last semester, but they don't seem to help. My counselor doesn't help because I refuse to tell her the whole truth. I'm terrified that if I truly open up to her that I will spook her or something, I have no friends around here. My best friend who is still the roommate I was speaking of

Now we come to tonight. The reason I finally decided to type this is because I just finished masturbating to a mixture of pedophilia and incest. The pedophilia is not as common for me to masturbate to as the incest is. I have successfully masturbated to several types of porn, masking my tears so my parents don't here. I still lie way too much, and if I don't lie I just don't say anything. I have lusted after many women, most of them were married or engaged. I wanted them so badly that when I couldn't sleep at night, which is every night, I would lie awake and dream about them. I would plan or lives out. I also dream about my death. I wish so much that I would get a rare disease or incurable cancer and I would just die. I would imagine my funeral and see all the people mourning. They would talk about the good old days that they secretly hated, but would pay their respects because of some sort of social obligation.

Sometimes when I masturbate, just to simply blow it up. I think of how others are so evil, and how evil I am and I can help but feel it should be eradicated. I go to church out of habit. I maintain my beliefs, but have no faith. I don't know why I do or think the things I do. I want to believe it's a scientific reason with my brain, but I also want to blame the God that I still believe in. I want to blame God because if He does exist, how in the hell could he make someone like me? I hope one day this thought process will lead me to lose my beliefs, and I'll finally be able to kill myself, again

Well, I don't care if you vote. I mainly just need to have my story out there. And I'm ashamed to say, but this is nowhere near the full thing. Thank you for stopping in.

I can't really explain how I felt. My emotions were a jumble, my heart was racing, and I just didn't feel *right*. Today I went and talked to a counselor and got some therapy sessions set up.

I have had experience with depression since I was 12 or 13

I have suffered a lot over the years from this illness.  I missed a lot of valuable adolescent experiences and growth opportunities.  At the time I saw several reasons that this happened: they weren't worth my time

I'm still learning how to deal with it.  I don't consider myself an expert by any means

* Many of the things you need to do in order to deal with depression involve things that depression makes especially difficult.  That's why it's such a bitch of a condition.  Understand that if you intend to undertake a path to health

* Get into counseling now.  Don't wait.  You're missing out on some things if you don't start facing up to your depression with seriousness.  You may not realize how badly it has affected you - accurate self-assessment is hindered by depression.

* Not every counseling experience is equal.  Cognitive therapy is very popular at the moment, however, doesn't always do that.  So if you don't think you're being helped, KEEP LOOKING until you meet a counselor who says things that resonate with you.

* The fact that you experience serious depression makes you different from most people.  That experience is valuable.  When your self-esteem is at its lowest ebb, and you don't have to be like everyone else, as long as you're not suffering.

* Don't reject medication just because it's medication.  Talk to people who have used antidepressants, ""When was the last time you experienced enough joy to make this a valid concern?""  ""Touché,"" I said.  I refer to my meds as ""shock absorbers"" because that's really what they are.  They just set a soft limit of how much negativity I can exert in response to any given situation.

* Depression is a condition of the body that can influence the condition of the mind.  Your health habits can influence your mental state enormously, the sooner you can move on and start living.

* There is a difference between *depression* and *despair.*  Depression can be effectively managed; despair is deadly.  Watch one so that it does not become the other.

* Get out and take a walk.  Step away from the Internet.  The Internet isn't a solution to your problems

* Some of us have had very bad times indeed, they need to be healed.

* Above all, you can save yourself a lot of grief, effort, and recovery time.

Anyway


Have you ever tried therapy, or holding a conversation so the idea of talking to a complete stranger that I am not comfortable with is kind of terrifying.


And on top of everything else I am just really worried she won't understand. I don't understand myself, happy, and hyper but also more sad than ever all at the same time- yeah I know that sounds really crazy) And then the other times I just feel sad and want to sleep all day, not talk to anyone, or try to find some distraction. And it's not that I am incapable of laughter, it's just that those feelings are so fleeting it doesn't even matter.

It is just so confusing. If I could describe myself in one word, in pain half the time, constantly looking for distractions. I find it annoying to talk about emotions and crap like that, tedious even. I also feel hopeless sometimes. Like this is going to just go on forever. And even in the brief moments that sometimes last for a few months but never longer than that I cannot feel truly happy because I am always waiting to feel sad again. It's like it always comes back.

Depression has an intense hold on my life that I cannot shake

**EDIT 1:** I just sent this post

**EDIT 2:** My mom and I had a good heart to heart last night. Turns out she has been on anti-depressants since she was 23 and she understands completely. They have helped her wonders she says.

Yup, my opinion is biased, but I still would say she is a detriment to anyone who suffers with mental illness and a danger to anyone who is suicidal (not myself right now, thank goodness).

***Update***
I asked my cousin who is a counselor for his opinion. Here is what he wrote. 
***Ok. You ask me, THEN she basically tells you you're not trying hard enough/have a personality disorder/are fine and exaggerating your difficulties (which has an overall shaming affect). A good therapist will never get into a power struggle because it is never helpful and is rather harmful, as you are acutely feeling.
The thing is
Btw
Let's redeem a bit of what happened. She was hopefully trying to encourage you by showing you the accomplishments of someone who struggled with mental illness? Though, fail.
Also, having a degree makes it worse. I have an M.A. and I'm making minimum wage? Twice clients have come in for coffee and how does that make me feel? Like a failure.
I think there is hope for you cous'. Look for the needle of truth in the haystack that psychiatrist threw you in. You said it kinda made sense when she said it's a career or no job for you

So my primary problem is actually anxiety which then fuels depressive episodes.  A huge part of my anxiety problem is that I need external validation to be okay.  Everyone needs that to some degree but sometimes I need it to an extreme degree.  As such, if I really am worthless (none of these things are true). 

I hate that I let assholes get to me. I especially hate it because it is a double whammy.  They are being rude to me and also they're not living up to the standards that I have for my fellow human beings.  If I were having a conversation with someone in person there's no way they'd use the language they do on the internet.

It just frustrates me on multiple levels and I end up feeling like shit warmed over.

I started college at 23, so I've spent the last four years busting my ass in order to make damned sure I can choose my graduate institutions. 

I've got all the right references and letters of recommendation, or picking up volunteer hours in the labs. But even so, I'll be lucky to finish my PhD before I'm 35. Now I'm here, I've ""proven"" I can do it, and I feel like I'm going to be half dead before my life even begins. 

I've put everything aside for school, I haven't had any ""college relationships"", I haven't even had a girlfriend since high school, I haven't done any partying, I've pushed all my friends away in favor of internships and lab volunteer hours. 

But even after all this time, I don't have a resume strong enough for the really competitive programs. 

The worst part is

All my skill points are in archery but I fucking hate bows. I've worked really hard for a life I don't want

1322793093.0,mwziy,My thoughts on depression.,webspacker,105,9,40,"I have struggled with dysthymia and depression most of my adult life (I'm in my early 40s now). The last decade for me has been mostly persistent sadness interspersed with episodes of depression while I fought to do 'normal' things like working and having relationships. I've recently finally started fighting it and seeking help - at least 10 years too late but I feel I'm turning a corner now. Here are some things I've learned. Hopefully they are of some use to fellow sufferers.

1. **There are remedies for depression but there is no QUICK fix for depression.** It will take a significant amount of time and effort from yourself and from others to drag you out of it. If we're talking about medication

2. **Depression and being prone to depression is something you will need to learn to live with.** Work on accepting that depression is a part of you and then work on getting better at living with it. Example: ""I'm very good at baking cakes. I'm not so good at being happy but I'm working on that."" It is possible to develop coping mechanisms but those of us who are prone to depression will always have to work just that little bit harder than 'normal' people to maintain a positive mood.

3. **Depression is not caused by other people or their actions

4. **Depression will affect your perception of EVERYTHING.** It is a bit like being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It will colour all your reactions. It will distort how you think about things. It will distort how you talk about things. Keep this in mind because it will help you identify negative thought and behaviour patterns and work on them. When you say 'No one can help me'

5. **Depression is not a sign of weakness or failure.** Struggling with depression in silence on your own is not a sign of strength. Don't let your depression tell you otherwise.

6. **Depression affects your self-esteem.** Try to stop being so hard on yourself. You are not an ugly loser

7. **Being in a relationship will not solve your depression.** Dear foreveralones and 25-year-old virgins; I'm terribly sorry you're having problems getting it on with someone but please don't expect finding a boyfriend or girlfriend will magically cure all your problems. Also, you will be more confident and therefore more attractive to other people.

8. **You NEED to talk to someone about how you feel, and non-depressed people are quite boneheaded when it comes to recognising someone might be depressed. Don't think about 'being a burden' or 'not wanting to upset them' - ask for help. They care about you and will want to help you. If the situation was reversed, you would be there for them if they asked for help, right? Get help. Rally the troops.

9. **Depression and anxiety can be inherited.** If your mother or father has a history of depression or anxiety, even if it's over something as horrible as mental problems, is always a good thing.

10. **Know your enemy.** There is plenty of material on the internet about depression. Read up and know what you're up against.

11. **See your doctor.** There might be an underlying physical or hormonal problem that is causing your depression. Your doctor can also prescribe medication and refer you to mental health services so you can get some professional help. Keep in mind that medication alone does not help you work on your depression

12. **If you REALLY want to get better

13. **You deserve nice things. You also deserve basic things like meals

I was being outgoing and letting people ""in"" with the very open fact that they could hurt me. I was just trying to be optimistic about everything. 

I should also note that being depressed had instilled a very negative attitude towards my worth. I was trying to take the ""fake it 'til you make it"" stance and just assume that if I pretended that people cared about me

Last weekend I decided to make a facebook event for my approaching birthday at a club. All week I got excited about seeing all my friends in the same place, and they'd all respond with ""most definitely"" or something like that, and it would just build me up to be happier. Despite it being uncomfortable to accept that all these people would be coming to see *me*, I was excited.

Yesterday was my birthday. I message the group telling them to text me if they need directions to the club or any help. At this point I'm expecting 15-20 of my closest friends. I got excited and put on my new outfit that I bought. I was excited. I showed up to the place with my boyfriend and his roommate. And we wait. My friend E shows up and hangs out with us. I'm calmly excited for everyone else to arrive so we can start dancing and singing our brains out to 90s music. This night, but needing directions or something. All of them say, ""okay, I'm on my way, I'll be there soon.""

It's about 10:30 now, and it was nice for her to show up. My friend E says that she has to leave early, so she buys us a round of shots and leaves. So now it's this girl I hardly know, F, my boyfriend, his roommate, and myself. I'm still holding out for my friends to arrive. I start text messaging them, ""I'm still on my way

F wants to dance

It's approaching midnight now and we'd have to leave soon to catch the last subway back. My boyfriend asks if I'm having fun and I drunkenly shake my head no. He makes some comment about how weird it was that nobody showed up and I couldn't hold back tears. So I hug him and suck it up. I tell F that we are leaving and ask her if she wants to come with us. I now felt responsible for this wasted girl I hardly know, or I'd worry. She says fine, and we leave.

As we walk back, basically since E left us. I reflect on the night. Most of my friends just never responded. Others told me they'd be there soon and then never showed. Others canceled at the last minute. One of my closest friends tells me that she's in a completely different state and wants to get lunch with me when she's back, even though she TOLD me she want coming.

It just made me feel worthless and not worth anybody's time or effort. My boyfriend, but didn't necessarily *want* to go. But it still doesn't explain the crappiness it feels to put in effort into these friendships, and be willing to do anything for these people, for them to not give a shit about me. I wasn't even upset at the people who clearly told me they couldn't come. I was pissed off at the people who only upon me texting them, did they admit that they weren't going or lied to me about being on their way. I put myself out there fore *one* day, just *one* day I wanted to be about me, as I *never* expect anything ever to be around me. I never expect to win any awards, or have any confidence that I deserve people to care about me... except for this one day. And now I just feel like crap.

Sometimes you wake up and it takes a moment to settle in

It's not a sadness or a despair, so you don't have to push as hard.  But to everyone else it looks like calmness.  Like quiet stillness.  Or laziness.  But there is something in the background yelling at you to keep moving, that where you are or what you are doing isn't right, but that something never tells you where you should be. It never tells you what's right, only wrong.  No sitting this one out.

If you live in the thick grey world for too long, it's the world your way, and nobody else seems to be caught by it. 

Eventually it will pass.  Some wind will blow and it will clear away. Some morning you will wake up and it'll be receding slowly.  Slowly enough that you can't see it move.  But eventually you don't feel it anymore.  But the gray takes away the satisfaction of knowing it's gone.  Just like you can't see out of the thickness, the thickness never mentions it.

I just honestly don't know how to deal with this anymore. All of my life, I have never been considered unhealthy or malnourished by any of my doctors.

My father always was the family cook growing up. I didn't like his food, I would be told to stay at the dinner table until I did. I still recall staying at the dinner table by myself until around 11pm at around 8 years old. If I left the table without finishing, I would be punished.

I am now 16 years old. Around November

Around December of this year, a meal at school, a snack when I get home, and that's it. School is the only place where I am provided with real meals, like pasta or pizza. At home, for snacks, I usually make myself a cheese sandwich with whatever cheese and bread is in the house. The only food my parents ever need to buy for me is cereal, bread

I'm currently 5'9 and 115 pounds. Since my dad stopped making food for me, I got a letter from my school saying that my BMI was below the 5th percentile for my age, and that I was required to see a doctor.

I saw my doctor, argues that I have an eating disorder. We were referred to a nutritionist, whom I saw yesterday.

The nutritionist also agreed that my diet is not psychologically fueled, and that this would not help.

When I got home around 4pm, since I considered the cheese sandwich my dinner. My father then came in, picked up my plate from under me, and dumped it in the garbage.

That was yesterday. This morning, and told me that my dad had told her not to. When we returned home, he scolded her for buying food for me. He has since given her instructions to never buy food for me again, under any circumstances. 

My mother's birthday is tomorrow, and knowing him, he'll refuse that to me as well.

I honestly do not know what to do about this. I understand this is a huge wall of text, or when I ask for his intentions when he throws out my food. I literally have no idea how to continue in this situation, and there is no food for me in the house anymore.

1307314151.0,hsedo,"I was diagnosed with Depression at age 12, and was medicated for 18 years.  Now, at age 30, I am free of medication and am no longer in therapy.  This is what helped me.",,21, but I don't know if the author of the parent comment ever read it.  I thought I would share it here, please call 911 or go to a hospital right away.

A little about me: I was diagnosed at age 12 and was placed on a regimen of anti-depressants and therapy.  That regimen barely helped me to survive for 18 years.  Now, and am no longer in therapy.  I feel fucking amazing, and I am more in love with myself and my life than I ever imagined I could be. 

Note: I'm not saying taking meds or going to therapy is inherently bad

THE COMMENT:

I have learned through some painful trial and error that I have to let myself sit with those yucky feelings if I am to help myself put an end to my suffering. I mustn't act on them if they are especially volatile, and maybe it will help you too:

-Find a safe, screaming, laughing, etc.

-Get rid of all distractions: no TV, loud pets (I mention this because my dog has this obnoxious habit of barking when I'm trying to concentrate), or computer. Just you and the silence.

-Sit comfortably

-Gently close your eyes.

-This part is REALLY important: Take a deep breath down into your belly (diaphragmatic breathing) such that your belly expands when you inhale and deflates when you exhale. Breathe slowly and evenly in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep doing this slowly, or the sensation of air rushing past your philtrum. Do this for as long as you like (ideally we should breathe like this most of the time, but it's hard to be mindful of it). Imagine that you're inhaling positive energy from The Universe and exhaling any negative energy stored in your body (I know it sounds cheesy, but it works for me).

-Close your eyes and do a body scan: what's going on in every part of your body? How do your eyeballs, elbows, etc. feel? Try to silently verbalize the descriptions in your head (i.e. ""I have a cramp in my thigh.""). If you feel any tension, mindfully tell that body part to relax.

-Now for the hard part (but also the most important and gratifying part if you can push through the pain): actively call up any negative emotions you might have felt throughout the day, that's perfectly okay, but try to pay attention to how the crying or screaming physically feels in your body. Just don't hurt yourself or anyone else. Keep pulling up the negative emotion and sit with it. Imagine that it's a big, nasty monster and that you are about to stick your head in it's mouth. I like to say, ""bring it on, fucker,"" at this point. Let the feeling wash through you, and describe it to yourself (i.e. ""I am feeling anger right now,"" etc.)

If at any point you feel overwhelmed by the feeling and believe you may act on it

You may find that the feeling dissipates considerably after doing this.

Of course, and have read about countless others for whom it has worked beautifully. Your mileage may vary.

The practice is based on a Buddhist tenet called Radical Acceptance

For now

EDIT 1:  [This](http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Acceptance-Embracing-Heart-Buddha/dp/0553801678) book helped me to hone my skills with this practice.

EDIT 2:  I am heading out to my yard to enjoy the sunset (this is another simple practice that has helped me immensely) but please feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions or even if you just need someone to lean on.

Alone in an empty room or empty house. Alone in a crowd. alone with people you want to believe are friends. Family. Other people you interact with and smile at and maybe if you smile real hard your brain will think you're happy. But all you can hope for is that maybe your fake smile will make them feel happy

I know you can't be happy all the time. I'd like to feel it once in awhile though. I think happiness has always been hope. Hope that never ends. Hope that never really leads to anything except hoping
today I hope they
I hope

it's hooplah. It's cheap talk to yourself that something will change, by design. We're too fucking simple to be this fucking self aware. What ever you think it is. Were all broken and hoping for a quick fix. The only thing that is quick is your life. And I never got it. I'm either far out in the future where i'm dead and nothing matters, or i'm holding my hope in the present so hard that it can't get away, it can't change and become a reality. Or maybe those are reflections of each other and i'm just this tangled thought of a person and i'm never going to be whole.

Hope is the worst drug. Idiots can hope. The poor can hope. People who have everything hope. No one is ever happy. And I want to accept that. I really do. I want to know it's natural to feel suffocated and sad sometimes. Sometimes. This is why people kill themselves. It has nothing to do with life. It's all about hope and you need a lot of hope to keep living, you give up hope. But you also stop lying. So who wins, the devil or your gods? The horror of nonbeing or the torment of existence? I see the patterns of human morality. I see the religious arguments and existential allusions in them. I get that you need something. I just wanted someone. Just one.

His hurt hurt me more than this breakup. I was going to ask him to marry me when we were away at Christmas.

I just wanted to vent. Upvote

**TL;DR** Nearly killed myself, very very sad.

**EDIT 1: A DAY ON**
It's about now I feel like I need someone to tell me how well I'm doing. A day on, your words helped me through the night, and I'm positive they will help me through tonight too. God knows how I'm going to survive work tomorrow.

We continued to talk. I kept asking him why. I got the answer. Because I didn't support him, him two steps in front of me.

In my defence

1336705560.0,thlrr,I lost another friend to suicide today.,rachiedoubt,95,10,26,"Yes, and I still am. I woke up this morning thinking of her

But then, but she was more of a friend than most people in my real life have ever been. I thought she was doing better. I hadn't heard from her in awhile, but that was normal. She'd pop up on LJ every few weeks. I just can't believe she's gone. From the world. She'll never... be... anything again. She'll never breathe or sleep. 

It's terrifying. I'm so afraid of losing people to mental illness. I have two people in my life right now who are struggling with depression and suicide more than they ever have before, and then this happens. Reminding me, yet again, that life is incredibly fragile and that I can't fix everything. And I don't like it.

I was suicidal earlier this week. I'm suicidal on a regular basis. But not to the extent that I used to be. I used to want to kill myself every. single. night. I never thought I'd make it past 18, and not want to die. But I have them now. Things changed. They did. Not without effort, but they changed. I still struggle with depression (Bipolar II) and suicidal thoughts and other things--I don't believe any of those things will ever go away (and who knows, they could come back full-force someday)--but right now, I am okay. I never thought I would be, but I am.

So please... don't give up. Not just because losing someone to suicide is an absolutely horrible feeling, but... I have to remember to tell myself that feelings past. They don't last forever. Even if they only let up for a few moments each day, live for those moments. Live for the days when those moments won't be as infrequent as they are now. I promise you, that someday, things will be different. I promise you, I do understand. So many people have come back from worse things than I could ever imagine--and they're okay today. It is possible. So please... just remember, in those moments where everything feels absolutely hopeless, deep down,self,

At this point in my life I have given up the hope of things ever getting better. In fact, it was the words of someone that did it - pulling everything into perspective in one cruel, thoughtless remark and I realized that people don't want me happy for me - they want me happy for them.

I can't be happy. I've tried. It eludes me. It is not in me. Maybe I was born without the capacity - or maybe there is just too much pain from my past to get over. Maybe I am just weak. But either way

I spent all of yesterday trying to think of a way to take my life that would look natural, without giving a shit.

I feel dead already to be honest. Now I guess I'll just stop fighting my depression and ""live"" with it. Maybe battling it just makes it worse. Maybe accepting it is the only way to live with it. I'll die eventually - either by nature or by choice

Someone will say ""that is the key to true happiness"" and maybe it is. I have no idea what true happiness is so really can't debate that point. To me it makes me feel like a player in other people's plays, I'd rather not pretend to be happy *FOR* them.
