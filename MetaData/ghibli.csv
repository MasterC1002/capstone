- Should we watch the films live

- How will we choose which movie to watch? And when should we choose the movie?

The whole Totoro costume is washable and re-wearable as the front pouch still exists for her hands - which took some careful stitching. The claws were detachable. I bought a second pair of tracksuit bottoms to make the ears and tail (not in a photograph). 

i made a matching grown-up one for her Dad to take her treat and treating... she was very annoyed by the end of the day by the lack of knowledge of people as the first thing she said was ""I am NOT A BUNNY"" in the same way nicholas cage said about the bunny in conair.

1370728124.0,1fy4hq,Toshio Suzuki discusses Studio Ghibli inside workings.,yknik,60,8,8,"Hello Ghibli People

Just a casual fan here. Toshio Suzuki

Hayao Miyazaki doesn't have a set script/storyboard during production. He tells the whole production staff to sketch for 20min and then calls a meeting to see what ideas everyone has. They collaborate then continue the process. The tv host points out that not only the audience gets to enjoy the suspense of the story unfolding

Hayao Miyazaki never leaves film

A unique feature of the animation in Totoro was the soft and warm furriness of Totoro's tail and the interior of the cat bus. Those are indicative of the master that Hayao Mizaki is.

Originally the idea was for only one daughter in Totoro. That's why there is only one girl holding an umbrella standing next to Totoro with the father's umbrella waiting at the bus stop in the publicity poster. The girl is neither Satsuki nor Mei. Hayao Miyazaki kept it that way as a memory of the initial idea. And I guess he doesn't throw away art. 

Satsuki was too perfect a girl according to Toshio Suzuki. He and Hayao Miyazaki had continual arguments about that story point. He didn't believe there could be such a diligent and mature child helping with cooking and housework in such a manner with her mother in the hospital. Hayao Miyazaki said there could, ""See? Now there; she is no longer too perfect."" 

A unique feature of the animation in Kiki was to do with how wind is represented in relation to how the character is presented. Usually the character's hair blowing in the wind is how it had been represented in animation, the character's skirt was drawn to be blown vigorously by the wind too. For inspiration on how skirts blow in the wind, Hayao Miyazaki spent an afternoon in Kichijoji downtown watching girls skirts billow in the wind. The director is so eccentric, comments of the studio celebrity guests imply, and how he ignores the fact that that would usually be rather socially unacceptable.

A special animation point in Ghibli animations is how the movement of characters and objects, often in Ghibli films there is much movement toward or away from the viewer. Giving a sense of reality. Also coming forward diagonally or going away diagonally. These are a specialty in Ghibli productions. Examples from Kiki are shown.

In Nausica some scenes were illustrated by the man who would later create the Evangelion animation. He showed up one day at the studio and said

In Ponyo

I've spoken with the mods and they are behind our idea. We're going to watch each film chronologically. At the beginning of the month

I realize with only one film per month, which seems very reasonable. So, without further ado, here's our schedule!

* October 2013: Castle in the Sky
* November 2013: Grave of the Fireflies 
* December 2013: My Neighbor Totoro
* January 2013: Kiki's Delivery Service
* February 2014: Only Yesterday 
* March 2014: Porco Rosso 
* April 2014: Pom Poko
* May 2014: Whisper of the Heart 
* June 2014: Princess Mononoke 
* July 2014: My Neighbors the Yamadas 
* Aug 2014: Spirited Away
* September 2014: The Cat Returns 
* October 2014: Howl's Moving Castle 
* November 2014: Tales from Earthsea
* December 2014: The Secret World of Arriety 
* January 2014: Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea
* February 2015: From Up on Poppy Hill 
* March 2015(hopefully): The Wind it Rises

I am really excited to get started next month

I did some research via imdb and found myself wanting to watch Spirited Away, I went over and we first watched Howl's Moving Castle. Wow. It is nothing like I had ever seen. A stunning film with some humor here and there. Next, we watched My Neighbor Totoro which was much different from the one we had just watched. After watching, it left me in a good mood. Another film that is impossible compare to any movie I had seen before. It was 3 a.m. by now and it was time to get some sleep. 

Today, and decided it was time for Spirited Away. Ah, where do I start with this one. The story is awesome, for lack of better words. Each of these movies had amazing storylines and I found myself wanting more after each ended. 

If I had to choose

I had found myself going through the most recent pages on this subreddit and found awesome submissions. I would like you guys to give me some movie suggestions! 

Here's what I have on my list that I want to watch thus far:
- Princess Mononoke
- Castle in the Sky
