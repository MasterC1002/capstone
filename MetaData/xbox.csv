I hardly ever sell my games back and rarely buy them used. If I really want a game that I cannot afford I wait until the price drops or there is a sale. I understand that my situation may be different than others

Again, and everyone wants to support the popular opinion, so even more hype is being produced.

When I look at the main issues

- I feel that - Much like movies/music on iTunes - there will probably be a limit of times a game can be transferred. Essentially, so what if there is a re-up fee for used games. Chances are that places that sell the game will either include the price in the purchase, or dock the cost to match the fee.   

- With the inability to trade games, I'm sure that you will be able to stream games just as easily as you stream music or movies. For PC gamer, such as myself, having a 1 shot copy for a game is nothing new. Hell, When I wanted to play Star Craft after a 5 year absence, I went online and bought a new access code for $5...did I bitch and whine... yeah...a little, but once I started playing I didn't care, while the actual game will be cloud based.

- The main reason having access to the internet is so important is because it seems that Microsoft is trying to remove some ""planned obsolescence"" from their games by allowing for the feature of streaming games. They talk about how a majority of the processing for Forza 5 will take place via the cloud processor. The reason you need to be connected is so that you can continue to have next gen graphics on their current system. I've used the Onlive service, but rather introducing the fact that the internet simply is the wave of the future. Look at the impact Xbox Live has had on the 360 (from when the 360 first came out until now). Everything from Smart Glass to Netflix, let alone game DLC NEEDS an internet connection...this is nothing new!

- As for the Kinect always being connected...being plugged in and being on are two different things. I always have my webcam plugged into my computer, I feel that a majority of the console's programming is based of the Kinect. Simply put, removing the Kinect would be like unplugging your desktops mouse or keyboard. While you may still be able to access what you need without either of these, it sure is handy to have them plugged in. 

Again, like Troops deployed overseas, who may not have internet access. But at the same time, I feel that with the launch of a new 360, Microsoft will probably produce one title for both systems, but it may lose some of the features due to being a previous gen console. 

Are the issues? Yes! But we still have almost half a year before we can even buy one of these machines. Chances are some things will change

Just my 2Â¢

If they really wanted to get back on equal footing with the price, OR... just drop the price down to $450. I don't think many people would think much of a $50 difference (or at least not as optically displeasing as a $100 difference).
Right now it's a PR game and Sony is kicking butt. That said, and possibly start that backlash (even a small one) against the popular kid Sony.


I have a feeling Microsoft is frantically going over contracts with game publishers and retailers to weigh their options after the smack down by Sony at E3. It'll just take time to figure out what they can legally do as their next move.


Or they'll just look at the fact that the XBOXY ONE has already sold out launch day pre-orders as a sign they don't have to do anything but sit back and collect the cash from the Microloyalists. That would be a very big mistake.


As far as the SpyBox diatribes are concerned


I don't think Apple employees are listening or watching me on this always connected camera/microphone device I have in my pocket right now. It would be a massive liability.
It'll be interesting to see how everything shakes out over the next 5 months after Microsoft weighs its options with their partners.

There were features of DRM that I liked (cloud capacity

However

I propose the solution:

The XB one treats physical copies of games the same way the 360 treats them - must be in the tray to play

The XB one treats digital downloads the way Microsoft initially planned to treat all games- DRM implemented (trading restrictions)

Would anyone buy a physical game for â¬60 when they could download the digital version for â¬40 (and a week earlier as an added incentive)? If Microsoft did this everyone would move to digital/DRM models almost instantly. 

This option would allow your gamers in the third world/nuclear subs etc. to still be able to buy the XB one also.

1344869919.0,y5a9s,A How-To on Cleaning Your Xbox!,Psychozoa,26,5,10,"I see many people on here with broken systems or wondering how to take care of them

**Let's Start Basic**

What will you need? Let's do a quick cleaning on your system.

* Q-Tips
* 91% Rubbing Alcohol
* Compressed/Canned Air
* An old towel or shirt you don't care about.

But how will we get the system open? Well these will be specifically for a Phat system

* T6 Screwdriver (You'll only need this if you want to remove the motherboard from the chassis)
* T8 Screwdriver
* Small Flathead Screwdriver
* Small Phillips Head Screwdriver
* A small poking tool (This will be to pop off all the tabs)

You can easily find a guide on how to open up your console online

* What you want to do is first blow out as much air as you can from the motherboard, fans, and fan shroud that you can easily pick out.

* Good? Now run over your whole motherboard with rubbing alcohol and q-tips. Depending on how dirty your console is

**Let's get on that disc drive

* First off: Do not **EVER** blow any air into the disc drive!!!! This is a super easy way to kill it! If you blow air into it thinking you're smart

Anyways

* If you see any dust on the actual drive casing that you open

* Now what you want to do is use the q-tips and rubbing alcohol to go over any parts of the disc drive you see getting dirty or gummed up or dusty. Do **NOT** touch your laser with a used tip!

* Flip the drive over and flip the eject mechanism to force open your DVD tray. Clean all the gears and the belt really well.

* If you haven't already

There. You've pretty much refurbished your Xbox. There is one more step you can take for preventive maintenance regarding the Red Ring of Death

Do the following ONLY if you feel like it's needed. If your Xbox has been running hotter than normal

**Replacing Thermal Paste**

What will we need?

* [Arctic Silver 5](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100007)

* [Thermal Material Remover](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100010) (I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this!)

* A decent alternative to the remover would be 91% rubbing alcohol (it HAS to be at least 91%

* Q-TIPS!!!!

* Paper Towels

What we'll be doing here is removing the CPU and GPU heatsinks (the two big metal pieces you see in the middle of the motherboard)

Now as for removing the motherboard

Now what are those X things on the bottom? Those are the X-Clamps that fasten down the heatsinks. There is a kit you can buy [here](http://team-xecuter.com/xecuter-unlock-kit-v3/) that includes a special X-Clamp removing tool

What I do is put the flathead into the outer portion of the part where the screw went into, apply a little bit of pressure with your finger. You want to be very careful to not flex your board or bend the x-clamps! At this point I also like to use a small cardboard box (a dryer sheet box I've found is the perfect height on a flat surface) and I keep the motherboard on something like a towel.

It's very annoying

* Now put down that thermal removal solution on each chipset and leave it for at least 5 minutes, it's so much easier.

* Wipe down the heatsinks with a paper towel

* Next

* You'll know you're good to go when your chipsets are clean. And I mean **CLEAN**

Now on each chip you see apply some Arctic Silver 5

**PROTIP**: You don't need to spread it out over the chip! When you put the heatsink back on

Once you're good to go

Congrats

What many construed as one of the worst press events in history, and I hate disks. I know many rely on used games because the prices of new ones have risen exponentially. I however can't stand the used game market, how stores like Gamestop profit off of hard work put in by others, and the individuals who work hard to see their vision come to fruition see less money because of it. 


I can see why the online check-in bothers people, and based off of how it works in the real world, because they've done it so often in the past. 


Sony on the other hand recently rejoined my gaming life in the way of a PS3. I like the design of it, Resistance, Infamous). My only complaint about the hardware centers around the controller, which is impossible for me to use for any type of FPS. The software is clunky compared to the 360's but it's not bad. PS+ is a really cool concept, and I'm glad MS is stealing the free games portion. But the PSN has been a pretty bland experience overall, with connectivity problems and disconnects I've never had using Xbox Live on the same connection. 


Sony has decided that it can capitalize on people's fear and confusion over the XboxOne by not advancing the gaming industry. They continue to rely on physical storage, is not a smart move. It's better to ignore their existence because they are irrelevant to selling your product. 


By pricing the console at $399, hell I have a Sega Genesis hooked up to my TV, but Sega was eventually crushed in the marketplace by Nintendo, Sony, and eventually Microsoft, and is now a distant memory in the gaming hardware game. Sega won the battle, but lost the war.


Sony is offering something core gamers are inclined to buy because it's familiar to them. It's a proven fact that we humans don't like change, at least amongst the hardcore gaming crowd. But as long as Sony continues to pile on debt as they have for the past 7 years, the Xbox will win the war.

I have been playing Black Ops 2 &amp;amp; since receiving a new modem for a new Time Warner service I have been unable to open my NAT, &amp;amp; going to a Time Warner store to get a new modem model, there is a conflict running the Xbox to the wifi router via ethernet
To start, if you will).  Per Xbox staff there is a need for a firmware update &amp;amp; this has not happened in the last 5-6 months, this would resolve the issues I am having with connecting to my wifi router, as well as connecting other devices directly to the modem with an ethernet connection.  I spoke with Xbox Live Support staff yesterday who informed me of this, but this fell to the deaf ears of 3 Time Warner staff over the phone, as well as speaking directly to staff at my local Time Warner store.  Finally, I spoke with Xbox Live Support this afternoon &amp;amp; they were more than helpful.  They conference called Time Warner with me to explain the issue &amp;amp; within a matter of minutes I now have a Time Warner technician coming to my house tomorrow morning with a new modem.

* I'm 16 and I enjoy gaming. I don't have all the time in the world for it


* I'd probably be the only one playing it. My sister claims to love video games but she plays them once every few months and they're usually the Lego games. 

* We have pretty steady Internet. It rarely goes out but when it rains really bad we lose it. 

* I know it has to check in at least once a day

* What in the hell is DMR and why is it such a big deal?

* A year or so ago I'd say that I'd play lots of games but now I really just play The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Occasionally

* I know I wouldn't use the Kinect. 

* I loved our PS2 and I loved our 360 even more. We never got a PS3 but I've played it and I honestly don't really like the setup. I just really lean towards XBox. I know I don't owe them anything but I have the feeling that the XBox One is holding something that'll make it worth getting the console. What do you guys think?

One feature I am VERY interested is Xbox One's cloud computing. As far as I can tell, lighting, etc.

In my mind this is fantastic! That could free up gigs of RAM which could be used for other in-game things. This is a great explanation to the DRM, and if I'm not I can do other things.

I do believe Reddit is freaking out about some features like used games, but they're right, five years down the road who knows what the tech will be like? I predict developers being able to greatly increase games with cloud computing, which as far as I know is not available on the PS4.

Okay the easiest way to sum up what you do is tricking the system into believing it works. First, Turn the console back on. You should see that none of the segments are lit at all. No green, no red, nothing. This is where you trick the system. WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE CONSOLE, reconnect the HDMI/AV cable to the console. If the fates are smiling upon you, the console will boot up as normal, pretty much forgetting it was dead. 

Every time i have had 3 segments of hellish red, it's actually a lasting solution, rather than giving you a few extra precious minutes. As the title said, this MIGHT help, so there is no guarrantee it will work, but it's a method that worked every time i tried it. ",,self,,

I managed to get my hands on two of those coupon codes and ordered MS points from the MS store. 2 days later I never received a confirmation email and the charges had been removed from my CC account. I let it slide and didn't think much of it. 

Eventually

I was contacted but then told that there was suspicious activity on my account and that it had been locked. I was even in contact with Larry Hyrb (majornelson) here and he pointed me to some higher ups. But as of right now I've been told there is nothing they can do to remove the lock on my account and the best solution is to just make a new email. 

I have a Surface

I'm probably one of the biggest MS fans there ever was and it's flat out insulting that I've been treated this way. Even asked if there was some sort of compensation they could give me and they said things didn't work that way. It's been a frustrating 2 months.

My uncle has two old xbox 360s. I took them apart and took out the CD-ROM. I managed to get one of them out and put them into my current xbox. And it worked will until I put a game in

So my question is do you guys know what I can to fix it and play games? And DVDs? 

UPDATE!: Well I did what CaptainTim1982 suggested but it didn't work at all. So now I'm sort of an xbox and fifteen games.

1371680747.0,1goqnp,Today's Announcement: They just killed my interest,LucienPyrus,10,4,16,"When Microsoft announced the Xbox One I was among those who were upset over the restrictions. I was mad and announced that I would not buy it.

But then they released more about the family sharing plan. They released more about tying in digital and physical so that way you can have actual control over your digital content.

I was looking forward to being able to buy a game and then have a friend access the game i just bought and we could play together.

I was looking forward to be able to try out the games of all the people i knew

I hate discs and steam has been great for me because countless discs have failed on me and a move to digital protects my monetary interests.

DRM was a great way to manage control over content. DRM would allow you to deactivate the digital copy that you bought so that way you could sell it.

Originally every game was to come with a physical and digital copy. In order to sell it

This sounded like a restriction, and access the games you bought anywhere.

But no. That is now all killed. People threw a fit and now we can't have nice things.

Now instead of owning the digital games and being able to share them you are stuck with what you buy digitally. You can only play the digital games you bought on your own console. Your friends can't borrow it. You can't sell it. You can't do anything. You have no rights to digital versions anymore.

Now in order to share a game you actually have to be able to physically visit them. You can only share with one person at a time

All thru this generation, music and other applications transferred by way of XBL. A great deal of this content has cost us a substantial amount of real money (if anyone has the exact figure I'd love to see it).

**EDIT: 6/10/13 1:03EDT**

Holy tits there's SO much new information and it's only a half an hour in! I will make a synapsis for Xbox's E3 event at the end. If you want to talk to me my twitter is @NateY3K
 

**PROFILE AND XBL GOLD COMPATIBILITY**: All of your achievements, it's saying that you can choose to keep your gamerscore IF you want to. Me personally, I'm going to start from scratch on the next gen consoles.

**REVERSE COMPATIBILITY** (Games): Unfortunately you cannot play Xbox 360 games on the new console. This is what Microsoft had to say about it:


*""Xbox One hardware is not compatible with Xbox 360 games. We designed Xbox One to play an entirely new generation of gamesâgames that are architected to take full advantage of state-of-the-art processors and the infinite power of the cloud. We care very much about the investment you have made in Xbox 360 and will continue to support it with a pipeline of new games and new apps well into the future.""*


Keep in mind, but another thing is that it isn't able to detect if this disk is able to be apart with the instant feature. Also, if they were to keep all of the last gen games, then the Xbox One's disks and features would be limited to whatever the Xbox 360 can do which isn't much. This is what they (Xbox) said when they were asked if you were to be able to trade in, purchase and play pre-owned games.

*""We are designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games. Weâll have more details to share later.""*

E3 maybe?

**ALWAYS ONLINE DRM**: This is FALSE you do not have to be always online. But unfortunately you do have to download every game. For more details

*""No

If you disagree with it then look at it on the perspective of a Developer, etc: People pirate games, which is bad. And the only way around that is that Xbox confirms you're not pirating. That's the BIGGEST issue is pirating. That's the only reason why anything has Always Online DRM. How do you think Blizzard games make so much money? You can't pirate them! (At least Diablo III you can't)

**STORAGE**: Unfortunately

**KINECT**: The Kinect sensor is required for most games. If you ever plan on buying an Xbox One then make sure that the games that you're playing doesn't have anything to do with the Kinect. Here's what Xbox said about this:

*""The all new Kinect is now an essential and integrated part of the platform.  By having it as a consistent part of every Xbox One, leading to unrivaled ease of use, premium experiences and interactivity for you.""*

I kind of agree with this

**USED GAMES**: Major Nelson has confirmed that there WILL be used games and they are NOT being tied to your account. The downloading thing is one time only (for the console as long as the game is still there).  This is one of the big things on thinking that the Always Online is false because if it's just some digital download then how could you possibly keep people from pirating games?

**DISCS**: There are disks, you may not have to put in a disk. Which is good and bad. If you want to play a game at your (example) friend's house then you do have to install the game.

**EDIT 5/30/13** Sorry I didn't find this out immediately. 
When you buy a game (digital or physical) you have to download it though Xbox LIVE with the Xbox One, you can give it to your friend to download it. No more switching discs every time you want to play! Now, I've seen many things like this that have been going toward the whole ""used games fee"" thing that's been lingering around the internet. But, Xbox (no one in specific) quotes from Microsoft employees have suggested the opposite. We will find out before it comes out, keep checking here for more news.


--- **This is the end of the Xbox One portion of this post** ---

I will update this post with new CONFIRMED information as soon as I can or when it comes out.
