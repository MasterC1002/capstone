Press Release: Olympic Arms

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
Olympic Arms is a staunch believer in and defender of the Constitution of the United States

Legislation recently passed in the State of New York outlaws the AR15 and many other firearms, ignoring such SCOTUS rulings as District of Columbia v. Heller - 554, U.S. 570 of 2008, McDonald v. Chicago - 561 U.S. 3025 of 2010, and specifically the case of United States v. Miller – 307 U.S. 174 of 1939.

Due the passing of this legislation, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity - will no longer be served as customers.

In short

If the leaders of the State of New York are willing to limit the right of the free and law abiding citizens of New York to arm themselves as they see fit under the Rights enumerate to all citizens of the United State through the Second Amendment

This action has caused a division of the people into classes: Those the government deems valuable enough to protect with modern firearms

Olympic Arms invites all firearms manufacturers

Sincerely

Brian Schuetz
President
Olympic Arms

* Possession of hollow point bullets and similar **assault bullets** a felony.
* **EDIT** Must register and report ammo purchases.  Only purchase max 500 rounds.
* ~~6 round magazine limit~~ -- **EDIT** Apparently it is the normal 10 round limit. 
* ALL magazines must be fixed to the gun (can not be removed without the use of a tool)
* 100% prohibition of all magazines greater than 10 rounds.  All previous grandfathered magazines become illegal. Felony if you keep one.  
* Changing definition of shotgun revolving cylinder -- Basically only single shot shotguns will remain legal.  
* Bullet Buttons will become illegal -- All AR and AK style rifles that are currently equipped with them will be designated Assault Weapons.  Felony to possess.
* All gun owners now must be licensed like drivers.
* All gun owners must carry gun liability insurance

&gt;There's just one problem with the 90 percent ""statistic"" and it's a big one: It's just not true.  In fact, an ATF spokeswoman told FOXNews.com, in a clarification of the statistic used by her own agency's assistant director, ""is that over 90 percent of the *traced* firearms originate from the U.S.""

Source: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/02/myth-percent-small-fraction-guns-mexico-come/#ixzz2SiZsNKSx

Confirmed by NPR and Politifact (in case someone gripes about citing Fox as a source): http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103224899

So how does this break down exactly? 

&gt;In 2007-2008,000 guns to the ATF for tracing. Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.  But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.  In other words

Source: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/02/myth-percent-small-fraction-guns-mexico-come/#ixzz2SiadZiNq

So there you go.  Is it possible that some of the weapons that couldn't be traced *might* have originated in the US regardless?  Sure - I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of seized handguns originated in the US since they're easy to obtain and transport.  But the AK-47s, and other staples of drug cartel warfare obviously aren't coming from Bubba's Buckshot Bunker across the border, and to imply otherwise is blatantly dishonest.

There are more. Just because you don't hear about them
An armed citizen ought to have a pistol for concealed carry for self defense while out and about. And he ought to have free reign to pick whatever he likes to defend his home, light recoil (unlike shotguns), and the round's safety aspect of reducing overpenetration.

You ask why anyone would need an AR-15. Cursory testing will show that the 5.56 round actually penetrates less layers of drywall than shotguns firing slugs or pellets

Back in 1990, I established the same priority policy for Military and Law Enforcement, due to the requirements of their profession.

The same policy has been in place for 13 years now and has never been an issue until a few days ago. I do not support the idea that individual police officers should be punished for the actions of their elected officials. That said

With the fight in Colorado right now we do not have time to implement a new program

http://www.barackobama.com/gun-reform

We're no longer up against just the Brady Campaign or a few fringe senators on the left.  

We are up against the entire Obama election campaign apparatus; the same [billion dollar](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/obama-2012-campaign-spending_n_2287978.html) apparatus that [marshaled 65.9 *million* votes in the 2012 election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election

He doesn't even have to get them to the polls.  He's just trying to get them to call their legislators.

Welcome to official underdog status

If you've been sitting in the sidelines up until this point in time

Step 1:   [Contact your reps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/176fyq/operation_burning_wires_phoneemailtwitter_strike/)

Step 2:  [Join the NRA](http://membership.nrahq.org/).  More members is better than more money.  

Step 3:  Have your friends, and anyone you can convince to do it to do steps 1 and 2.

Step 4:  Educate members of the public.  Be an open advocate for second amendment rights.  **Take people shooting.  Take *everyone* shooting.  *Especially* people who disagree with you.**  Start them on step 1, 3 and 4 when they're ready.

It is with a heavy heart that I write to you today. I have been a citizen of this great nation for 46 years and 17 of those as a law enforcement officer. I have seen our nation go through some tough times. On January 24th

I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Alabama. That oath means something to me. I swore before God, my family, to protect them, to protect their rights and those precious documents. My swearing to defend these principles does not end with those who would pass such a law stripping current and future citizens of their right to keep and bear firearms. The motto of the State of Alabama is “We Dare Defend Our Rights”. I choose to defend those rights. 

If this proposed legislation passes and is signed into law it is a direct violation of the Constitutions of the United Sates and the State of Alabama. I will not obey it

Our Founding Fathers warned us about an overreaching tyrannical government. With great forethought they made sure the Bill of Rights included the 2nd Amendment as the only way to protect all the other amendments. No one can read that document and writings of the Founding Fathers and not know the true meaning of the 2nd Amendment. It is not about sporting purposes or hunting. It is for the defense of the citizens against harm and a government that no longer serves the people but wishes to strip them of their rights. 

I stood on the Capitol grounds in Montgomery on January 19th

I’m a Life Member of the National Rifle Association, with any legislation that further restricts the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. 

Sincerely
Bama-Shooter",,t5_2vtr4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/179ae3/i_will_not_comply_ar15com/

Most of the recent anti-gun legislation introduced to the 113th Congress was sponsored or co-sponsored by representative Carolyn McCarthy, who famously identified a barrel shroud as [the thing that goes up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ospNRk2uM3U).

Then we have Senator Feinstein

The US population is becoming increasingly urbanized.  Since the 1920s

Millions of kids are growing up without ever having seen or touched a gun.  They're presented a model of government (through the education system) in which guns don't exist

If people don't understand the safety rules we employ when using firearms (or don't even know that there are rules)

If people don't understand the mechanism of action of modern firearms

If a person has never touched a firearm and has no idea what the proper use of a firearm is

**In the Texas legislature, and the time to push for it is NOW.**

People feel the need to do 'something'?  **This** is the something we need to do.

Anti-gun folks will have a hard time arguing against it

- A proactive solution to the problem.
- More firearms training has been linked to fewer firearms accidents.
- Education focused.
- Elective.

**This** is what we should be pushing as the alternative to gun control measures.

The mantra should be

**Ask your state and federal reps to introduce bills similar to TX HB 1142.**

[Here's how to get in touch with them.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)

This should also be what the NRA is pushing for on a national level.

[Here's how to get in touch with the NRA.](https://contact.nra.org/contact-us.aspx)  Tell them to endorse this legislation and push for more of  the same.

&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen

&gt;The letter shown below is from DCJS but was distributed by a Law Enforcement Association to all it’s members. I’ve removed the Association’s information to protect our source but wanted to show you the depths to which we are falling. Orwell was right; just 29 off years on the date! 

&gt;Tom King 









&gt;The Letter 



&gt;&gt;At a time when all of us are finding ourselves doing more with less

&gt;&gt;The state has established a toll-free tip line – 1-855-GUNSNYS (1-855- 486-7697) to encourage residents to report illegal firearm possession. The tip line also allows for information to be submitted via text – individuals can text GUNTIP and their message to CRIMES (274637). While the state will provide the administrative support and fund the rewards

&gt;&gt;To spread the word about this free resource

&gt;&gt;The tip line can provide your agencies with another avenue for receiving intelligence about crimes being committed in your jurisdictions. This initiative is designed for communities where no tip lines are in place and is not meant to replace existing gun tip lines. 

&gt;&gt;Here’s how the tip line operates: 

&gt;&gt;The New York State Police staff the tip line 24 hours a day. Upon receiving a call

&gt;&gt;The State Police will in turn contact the appropriate police agency with the lead to initiate an investigation. Staff from the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) will follow up with that agency to determine the validity of the lead. Once the investigation is completed

&gt;&gt;If the information leads to an arrest for the illegal possession of a firearm

&gt;&gt;State Police staff will explain the program in its entirety upon notifying an agency that a lead has been generated for their jurisdiction. If you have any questions in the interim

**Suggested Subject:** [source3](http://www.grnc.org/grnc-alerts-archive/419-grnc-alert-2-9-2013-larue-tactical-takes-a-stand-for-second-amendment-rights)

If it’s illegal for us

**Suggested Message** Please change it up a bit. Add some of your own words.

Recently New York rushed an ill-advised and unconstitutional law infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Other states are poised to write similar laws. I urge you to follow the lead of LaRue Tactical which has adopted this policy: If it can’t be sold to law-abiding citizens

There are 800,440 NICS checks, and thus firearms sales, in January alone. Police sales are not your major business. It’s time for firearm manufacturers to send a clear message that you will not participate in the slow erosion of our Second Amendment rights.

(NICS numbers Source http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/20130205_1998_2013_monthly_yearly_totals.pdf)

The recall process varies by district, and address, A phone number and e-mail address can be helpful for verification, but aren't always required. Call the office of an opposing political party for the person whom you want to remove. They should understand the process in your area, have a vested interest, and can mobilize people to help. Don't forget to reach out to Libertarian groups - they will be behind you on this issue. Make sure you follow the appropriate process or you will be wasting your time.

Contact local gun shops, or any places that sell hunting licenses. Ask their management to help in any way they can. Ask them to post a notice on their website and social media channels and have them ask their staff to alert customers. Specifically talk to the manager in charge of the area that sells ammunition at larger chain stores. All these people may be able to collect signatures during the checkout process at their establishment. Contact the management for gun shows in your area about having a table at the door or a booth inside at each show. 

When you have the locations set and forms in place where people can sign their support - it is time to advertise. Place handbills on car windshields in sporting goods shop parking lots and retail outlets. Post notices on Craigslist with the locations where people can go. Post to Facebook pages and twitter feeds of major businesses and use common hashtags including #nra #2a and any others you see where people open to defending their rights will see them. There are regional and national forums online where you can post messages to get people motivated. There are news aggregation sites with niche audiences. Don't forget about reddit.com/r/progun and  reddit.com/r/gunpolitics. Connect with groups on meetup.com or similar community connecting sites. Post in the comments of news stories about gun control on national and local news sites and blogs. Anywhere you see people talking about this - let them know what you are trying to do. 

Once you start seeing results send a press release to each of the news outlets in your area. Call them and get the appropriate e-mail contact from the main operator for sending press releases to their newsroom's assignment desk. Make direct contact with an assignment editor or a general assignment reporter through social media to get your information out. If they have an outdoors or community section that would be the best option. If you aren't experienced in dealing with the media - don't answer questions you aren't prepared to answer. Don't agree to an interview if you don't know what you are doing and don't have a prepared statement that has been vetted by people who understand how to talk to media DON""T be baited into appearing on camera or giving an interview. Anything you say can be quoted. It is best to go through e-mail to share your message and control what you say unless you have media training.  

We have the numbers to make a huge difference - we simply need to mobilize and inform. You CAN make a difference in this fight. ",,t5_2vtr4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/1baz2c/recall_senators_who_vote_for_gun_control/

*To whom it may concern and for your consideration.
I am a firm believer that “We the People” not only vote at the polls but also with our wallets. Several companies have already made a pledge to stand with the people behind our 2nd Amendment and would ask you to join us in our fight to preserve it by any means necessary. We live in a world where people and corporations are no longer guided by principle. Instead
We don’t live in a police state. If it won't be sold to citizens
Please consider stopping the sale (where possible) of firearms and ammunition to Government and Local law enforcement in those places that have, NY, NJ, CO, MD, MI, etc)!

Arkansas law allows concealed carry on college campuses

Here is an article featuring me and detailing the issue: http://5newsonline.com/2013/01/20/ua-student-proposes-lawful-conceal-carry-on-campus/

In Arkansas; these requirements are as follows:
-21
-training course
-certified proficiency in weapon by state licensed instructor
-pass all federal and state background/psych checks

I know this may seem trivial

I'll link to the articles, but I need help and my university needs help. These kinds of victories are important. Here's an argument by one of my friends, a veteran, as to why he should be allowed to carry (makes good talking points): 

""Concealed carry is already legal in Arkansas

Licensed, faculty and the many law enforcement officers, and military veterans who attend college, carry concealed firearms for self-defense almost everywhere else in their lives, from restaurants to gas stations, without incident. Statistically, I can guarantee that you come into contact with at least one every single day. Why would their responsible behavior suddenly change when they cross a line onto a college campus?

We are not trying to replace campus security or the police. Nor does carrying a firearm negate the need for other safe behaviors, by nature, are reactive and most of the time are not able to stop a crime. The only people guaranteed to be at the scene are the criminal and the victim, yet ""gun-free zones"" ensure that only one of them will have a weapon. Why not give people the option of a defensive firearm as a last resort rather than curling up on the ground and praying that they aren't killed or seriously injured? Why not give that potential rape victim the option of stopping her attack?

200 campuses in 6 states currently allow concealed carry on all their public campuses, and, as statistics show, results in a decrease in crime, what is the downside?""

Respectfully
Joe Youngblood

Their explicitly stated purpose is to convince the senate that the majority of us support gun control.

Veterans deserved a vote on whether they would receive due process from a court of law before having their constitutional gun rights taken away.  But

Gun owners deserved a vote on Sen. John Thune's reciprocity legislation -- allowing concealed carry holders to carry their firearms from one state into another.

Gun owners deserved a vote on appropriations language to block 16

Reps. Stockman &amp; Broun circulate letter to KILL ALL GUN CONTROL

Rep. Stockman has just told GOA that he and Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) will be circulating a letter asking the House leadership to refuse to bring up anti-gun legislation that is NOT supported by a majority of the Republican members of the House of Representatives. 
 
Stockman’s effort could potentially kill ALL GUN CONTROL in the House. 
 
We know, if 117 congressmen sign a letter demanding that Boehner not bring up a gun control bill opposed by those 117 congressmen, gun control will die.  Without that letter, Democrats will join with anti-gun Republicans, and gun control will pass.

Why am I posting this here

Because next time any politician calls for, and who has not fought against all immoral and undeclared wars, or who has in any way voted to directly or indirectly finance these actions or make them possible - then they are guilty or complicit in the murders of many more children and many more human beings, in fact, than all the news-worthy shootings which presidents have shed tears over since the founding of the United States of America.

This is not about political parties (I would say the same thing to George Bush

Next time you have a friend or co-worker who simply won't listen to reason

Furthermore, and who will exercise self-defense if attacked by men in blue or black costumes claiming to have the moral authority to enforce immoral legislation.  I hope that we would all also be pleasantly surprised at the numbers of those previously wearing the blue or black costumes who would take off those costumes or refuse to enforce those laws which are immoral and victim-less crimes.

Governments in the 20th century alone have [killed](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM) over 100 million human beings

I foresee no time or season or scenario in which guns should or ever will be outlawed on this land;  but if that time should ever come. . . .let's make damn sure it is not at the whims of any government;  the hypocrisy of this act would be an affront to all reason and morality. 
 
I realize that this sub is supposed to be dedicated to more factual and straight-forward submissions regarding gun control . . . . I understand that it may seem like I'm making an emotional appeal.  I would however be more than happy to link to many more sources for most of my claims

&gt;We do know that the President will be coming to the Westin Hotel to address US Senate Democrats at their Congressional Retreat. We expect West Street to be closed. Plan of coming by way of Route 50 to Rowe Blvd and parking at the Navy Memorial Stadium. In the event that the shuttles are running slow

&gt;Please do not let this discourage your participation

&gt;Be prepared to spend the whole day here

&gt;Constitutionally Yours

---------------------
I have been a long time reddit lurker and a somewhat recent redditor.  I do not post much and over 90% of what I post is a comment in someone else's post.  I feel I have made some good points
--------------------
/End Introduction

I believe the current attack on our gun rights is an attempt to begin the process of removing them completely.  They want us disarmed.  I do not see any reason that the government would have any interest in an armed citizenry

Our system of government was created to be somewhat unique.  Revolutionary, lawyers, farmers, ranchers, miners, cobblers, policemen, and the like

This is the core of the issue.

We elect the same people over and over again to do the terrible job they are doing ""representing"" us and expect the result to change.  Because we no longer elect from our own peer group and instead elect from a pool of politicians we have designed a system by which once elected always a member.  

We have created a nobility.

We have created a ruling class.  This is a class very similar to the nobility of old.  Some have money, and may even retire from government service, but forever retain some of that power (sometimes a great deal) because of the favors owed and memory of the power they wielded.

A nobility by itself is not horrible.  There is very little that they can accomplish, as well.  The rich and the poor.  Do not kid yourself, if you cannot literally get away with murder, you are poor.  If you can (and you know if you can or not) then you are rich.  

The wealthy are the merchant class of old.

While the law says all are equal under the law the merchant class and the nobility are, steal, cheat and murder on gargantuan scales and get away with it.  Steal billions of dollars and pay millions in fines. 

The wealthy ask the nobility to create laws that directly benefit them and harm the poor (the little people) and the great thing is

We continue to elect the same idiots to their positions of nobility

The hilarity of the whole thing is we could fix it very

That is where we are today.  What I see happening is the finalization of the creation of the class (or caste) system here in the US.

1.  The military will become a social class.  Currently the military is viewed as an alternative to college and in many cases an alternative to minimum wage.  I have great respect for anyone who chooses to serve, will begin (and already has begun) to tighten restrictions on who can enter.  In the coming years, as the job of the military is reduced through automation (like the drones) the need for ""grunts"" will lessen and the military will become far, far more selective about who they accept.  It will be something that you have to work for.  Retention in the military will increase, it will be less and less common to see soldiers enter for a single hitch, rather the career military will begin to fill the ranks.  

At that point we are done.

Once the military becomes a life long career for a large percentage of people who enter, at that point, becomes your home and the leaders of it have complete control.  That also means that they have the ability to order you to attack the people without worrying about huge refusal and desertion (as they would today.)

At the same time as the government is working towards this goal they have another issue

With a military class to enforce the rule of the government and a people deprived of their 2nd amendment right to bear arms there will be no stopping the removal of the rest of the constitution.  Since there would be no remediation on the part of the people it will be easy to remove it - we have no teeth.

The fix is actually simple.

Never, reelect anyone.  Feel free to let them climb, but never elect the same person twice.  Always force the election of an incumbent.

Never, at least enough to not break the system.

Start by electing the black horse.  Elect the person with no experience.  Every damn time.  If we can replace 3/4 of those up for election in the next election with Libertarians it will throw enough crap in the mix that both parties would be filibustered.  In 6 years the entirety of Congress and the White House will have been replaced.  6 years - like the length of a TV series.

At the same time, decent person, then elect them to a higher and higher office.  Find people who share your goals and put them in office.

These are my goals / ideas  / thoughts:

1.  Freedom of the press is not free.  It is a responsibility.  The press is only a person or organization that reports truth and hard fact about corporations and government.  The news is boring.  The news is shocking (and requires some attention on our part).  The news is NOT sensational.  Unless someone in Hollywood is killed

I suggest the following:
1.  All press organizations receive a subsidy from the US government.
2.  All press organizations are REQUIRED by law to be independant corporations held in the public trust for the purpose of reporting news.
3.  Any television, however you must either not allow for advertising (other than self promotion) or your broadcast cannot utilize any government or publicly owned resources, or subsidized resources.  You cannot utilize a single easement, land grant, eminent domain or public airwave (a public airwave in this case is anything regulated by the FCC.)

This should prevent the news media by being influenced by corporate needs

4.  The federal government clarifies it's stance on the 2nd amendment though federal statute.
    a.  The right to bear arms is inherent in all citizens of the US.
    b.  Anyone who can pass a criminal background check and pass the training requirement can own and legally carry a concealed weapon.
    c.  Laws for carry and transportation of firearms are set on the federal level
    d.  The federal government and state governments are not in the business of criminalizing the people.  Thus
    e.  The federal government begins the subsidy of local firearms training organizations and the advertising to undo the last 50 years of lies and half truths about firearms and their place in society.  Anyone who wants to learn how to use a firearm is able to.

5.  The right of the people to education is sacrosanct.  All citizens of the United States have a right to education.  An educated people are a productive people.  An educated people are an inventive people.  We need to return to the position of being the world leaders in innovation.  We need to get some pride back.

6.  The corporation is hereby disbanded.  Immediately all corporations are converted to limited partnerships and ownership is split according to current stock ownership.  This may destroy the world economy and the dollar - at the very least.  I do not see a way around it

7.  The minimum wage is set to no less than 1% of your highest paid employee (all benefits included in this equation) or 1.5 x the federal poverty level,000.  I do not have a better solution for reigning in the insane gulf between the rich and poor, but am open to suggestion.

8.  All laws of the people apply equally to all.  All criminal attourneys are required to work 30% pro-bono or donate 40% of their income to legal aid organizations.  The rich get away with it because most of the attourneys for the poor are shit.  There are exceptions

9.  Basic Health Care is a right.  Standardized and reasonable heath care costs are a priority.  All health care companies are now subject to oversight from the federal government.  100% of emergency room care is now free.  All health care organizations are required to donate a certain percentage of their profits (this includes drug and medical equipment companies as well) to urgent care facilities and free clinics.  They must be able to justify the cost of medical care.  ALL medical care is declared in the public interest and only allowed to be non-profit.  Profiting off the death and injury of others is criminal.

9a - Mental care facilities are to be setup and funded by the ""state"".  Mental health is as much a priority and right as physical health. Proper care will probably be a major contributor to a reduction in crime and violence as anything else we could ever do.


10.  Prisons are to be managed by the state and federal government.  If the costs are too high then it is charged to the government to find a solution.  I suggest working on breaking the cycle of repeat offenders.

11.  Drug use is a health problem, regulated and taxed.  It should be no harder to get cocaine than Vicodin.


For now that sums it up for me.  I realize there are a ton of other areas that I have missed.

TL;DR - we are fucked as a people.  Move to Canada.


EDIT- thank you all for the comments. Some notes since the replies seem to be focused on some very good points.


1.  Let me start with: I realize that much of what I suggested is socialist.  I do not have really good answers so I will try to explain my thoughts.

2.  Lawyers - this one is tough.  Often your ability to mount a defense is based on money. No ALWAYS it is based on money.  Good attorneys are expensive. Bad attorneys are cheap. District attorneys love bad criminal defense lawyers since they are easy to beat. They do not have the staff or the budget to fight for their client adequately. Public defenders have no budget and have too many cases. I am not trying to subject anyone to the rule of government

3.  Health Care - we already have dozens of social programs for health care.  Emergency room services are already subsidized. They are required to provide service, get an MRI, have a doctor take a look and prescribe some medication - there goes $3900.00. And it may not work at all.  How is that reasonable cost for service?  The free market has driven an essential cost higher for us than any other nation per capita.  Why?  Again, what is the solution? Should quality medical care not be something that everyone deserves access to? Or should you be indebted forever because some drunk drive runs you down and leaves the scene?

4.  I completely forgot any commentary on illegal aliens. I do not support illegal aliens receiving any benefit from living here. I am not opposed to providing a path to legalized citizenship

5.  I also did not comment on welfare.  If you are on the dole you should work.  There is plenty to be done

I will add more later

I would really enjoy hearing other solutions....


Edit - had to add a comment to continue.  Hit the 15000 limit...

Political scientist here. I want to emphasize something to members of this sub. The NRA and other progun groups currently hold the advantage in the gun debate - the NRA has a high approval rating

By themselves, and Bloomberg's Mayor's Against Illegal (read: all) Guns can't force any new legislation. But that all changed, in my view, when Obama said he would put [""everything I've got""](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/politics/obama-to-ask-congress-to-toughen-gun-laws.html?_r=0) into passing new gun control laws, including an AWB. I originally (stupidly) didn't think Obama would push hard for a new AWB. But if we take him at his word, he is going to.

Obama for America is was the president's election and re-election campaign. It is widely recognized to be one of the most effective political organizations in the nation. It has a ground operation in dozens and dozens of states. It spend a billion (with a B) dollars to defeat Mitt Romney in 2012. And it didn't just fade away after the 2012. [It is currently gearing up to push for new gun laws by pressuring Congress](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/obamas-campaign-turns-to-gun-control/). 

&gt;“The president has the most exciting campaign apparatus ever built. It’s time to turn that loose

From a political science perspective, they just have to convince a [few dozen congressmen](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/house) and senators.

If you think the NRA can stop them without you doing anything

&gt;The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans

And they're not alone. Bloomberg

&gt;Mark Glaze, including those of Democrats and Republicans. “We will be doing what we can do to make sure that sitting on their hands is the least safe place to be,” he said.

MAIG has millions upon millions of dollars. Combined with the money and huge ground game of OfA and the misleading research of the Brady Campaign and VPC, and expanded background checks. Do not believe for a second that the NRA alone can stop them. America is becoming more and more suburban and fewer suburbanites own guns than ever before. At the same time, many swing Congressional districts are becoming primarily suburban. If the anti-gunners effectively target these few congressmen, they **will** pass an AWB.

Especially if you live in one of America's swing states or a [swing congressional district](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/house)

**TLDR: Obama is using his old campaign apparatus to push for an Assault Weapons Ban and it will be highly effective. Don't be complacent for a moment thinking the NRA can stand alone on this and win. [Contact Congress now](http://www.congress.org/congressorg/directory/congdir.tt) and donate whatever you can to the [NRA](http://membership.nrahq.org/)

Arguing for the right to own these magazines is something that can be problematic

Furthermore, buffoonish, or just downright stupid, and it makes me cringe every time I watch it happen.

So

**Know Who You're Debating**

Most of the people reacting to Sandy Hook (and other rampage shootings) are not gun people. For the most part, however, completely ignorant about guns and how they work, and have a general level of fear associated with guns and people who own them.

What they're looking for is an answer to the question of ""how do we stop rampage shootings"" and they're grabbing at the first straw

**Arguments That Don't Work

*• It's my right to own them because 2nd Amendment.*
-This argument is true, you come off sounding like you put your right to own a dangerous product above the safety of their kids.

*•I own them because I can.*
-Again

*•I own them because I may need them for self-defense.*
-Remember, most people assume that a more traditional style of gun, like a revolver, would be perfectly adequate. Furthermore, statistically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of defensive encounters, in truth

*•I own them because we may need them in case of invasion/the US government turns on its own people/The Revolution/Wolverines!*
-Most people in this country live comfortable lives, and even if they *do* entertain the notion that such a thing could happen here, they cannot and will not consider the idea of actually picking up a gun and fighting against an existential threat. Any argument that follows the revolutionary line of reasoning will be dismissed out of hand as paranoid fantasizing. You will be painted as a lunatic preparing for an event that will never happen. The assumption is that you're so delusional that you are putting your right to a revolution that will never come up against the protection of children.

*•I own them because it makes it easier for me at the shooting range or because having them reduces amount of time I have to waste loading magazines.*
-Again, then who cares if it means you're slightly inconvenienced during a range trip?

*•I own them because I compete in USPSA/3 Gun/some other form of competition.*
-This argument can help to counter the ""you don't need a high capacity magazine to hunt"" or ""why would anyone have these things?"" and pointing out that you're involved in a competitive sport may confer some legitimacy

**Arguments That Should Work

The best way to voice your opposition to a magazine ban isn't by asserting your rights. Regardless of how strongly you feel about the 2nd Amendment

The best way to make the case in favor of &gt;10 round magazines is from a policy perspective. As gun owners we should all be actively engaging in the public discussion over these items

***The best arguments against a ban on these magazines is to point out that such a ban SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.*** It's thoroughly terrible policy that will absolutely not stop the next rampage killer from taking out as many victims as his tortured mental state demands.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments that are bound to be the most effective

*•The 1994-2004 Assault Weapon Ban*
-The US had a ban on these magazines that lasted for ten years, regardless of the type.

*•The technology is already ""in the wild.""*
-With the exception of the ten years during the federal assault weapon ban &gt;10 round magazines have been sold with hundreds of millions of new guns, and completely untraceable. Any attempt to regulate these magazines will essentially be DOA because there are already so many of them in private hands.

*•Consider the implications of enforcing a ban*
-Everyone wants to get behind the idea of a ban without putting any thought into actual enforcement costs. Ask them to explain how they would enforce a ban.
Would they be willing to ok warrantless searches to find these magazines?
Would they be willing to arrest, and imprison for ten years anyone found to possess one?
How much would it cost to imprison all of these millions of people?
Would we have to construct new prisons for them?
Would it really be worth it?

(The nice thing about this line of reasoning is that it's an extremely easy litmus test to see if you're dealing with someone who's halfway rational or not. No rational person would actually agree that locking up tens of millions of people who've harmed no one would be a good idea. And if the person says they're ok with it

*•How to enforce a ban?*
-How would you keep people from importing unmarked magazines from outside of the US

*•Point out that other mass shootings have taken place without &gt;10 round magazines*
-3 of the 4 guns used by the Columbine shooters did not use high capacity magazines. Specifically

-Changing magazines is an action that even an amateur can easily complete in under four seconds. Even if the killer is limited to ten round magazines, but Loughner's gun jammed, which is what provided the time to others around him to react.)


Finally, and gives you additional legitimacy. Remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to stop or reduce the number of rampage killings, especially those targeting children. As gun owners, we have not only a unique perspective and specialist knowledge on the subject, but we've also got the most to lose. Therefore it is extremely important for all of us to present the best arguments we can.

I hope that this post is useful. I've been making a number of these arguments on public news forums with some success. I'd appreciate any feedback.

The incoming chair

The 2012 committee was comprised of 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats.

The upshot here is

In addition to calling your own representatives this week, but generally most of them stick around from year to year.  Call as many as you can each day.  All is better than some, some is better than one, one is better than none.  Most of their officers open either at 8:30 EST or 9:00 EST.

Remember, ""Please encourage the representative to say **no** to new gun control measures.  We need to shut these bills down in committee.""

If they ask for your zip code and you're not local, where s/he is making decisions that affect every American.""  Then give them your zip code if you want.

Pro-gun reps need the call so they have big numbers to point to when they argue in our favor. Anti-gun reps need the call so they'll feel weak and be less likely to push the issue.

I get no karma for this post.

1356604268.0,15iixo,The Opposition to the Assault Weapon Ban of 2013 supported by Diane Feinstein,OmniaMors,116,27,22,"To begin I think it is important to thank Senator Feinstein for pushing legislation. First to show support of politicians who follow up their words with actions. Second to thank her for keeping the main goal of keeping our society safe a priority. And third to show that we are on the same side, would do nothing more than infringe on the second amendment rights of Americans

To begin

The first document provided to justify this was the Urban institute study for the department of justice. This study was cited because it showed that the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was the cause of the drop in gun murders. However what this study ignores is that gun homicide was already on the decrease and even after the ban was lifted gun homicide still went down. this study used a correlation based proof which is a *post hoc ergo proctor hoc* logical fallacy. Therefore this study can be set aside as being based on a fallacy.

The second study, which is 7.3% per years, is actually less than 0.11% of all gun related crime a year. Essentially all this study does is take the equivalent of a change of 1 out of a 1000 per year, and manipulate the numbers to falsify the significance. On top of that, after the 1994 ban was lifted the use of an assault weapon in crime still decreased, showing that this study is not only manipulative, but also falls into the logical fallacy mentioned above.

The third study in a Washington Post story

The next piece of evidence is a letter to the editor

And then we hace a study by the Violence Policy Center

The last study by the Police Executive Research Forum found that 37% of police departments reported a noticeable increase in the use of assault weapons by criminals. However this study has several issues. First that it does not show how many showed a decrease

On top of the fact that **none** of the studies showed to justify a ban are either incomplete, other studies have shown the opposite.

First the study by The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, like race and wealth to avoid the *post hoc [...]* fallacy seen in the studies mentioned above, and found that when the data is properly analyzed, not only has gun legislation shown to in no way prevent crime but that other than the instant background check, gun control laws like the ban **increase** gun related crime. That is to say, laws like the Assault Weapons Ban kills our citizens by disarming them, and making them weak.

This is better illustrated by the study by the Valparaiso University Law Review

&gt;""The most conservative estimates show that adopting these so-called ”shall issue” or nondiscretionary permit laws reduced murders by
8%, and robbery by 3%. To
put it another way, 4200 rapes, over 60,000 aggravated assaults, and 12,000 robberies. Criminals do apparently respond to deterrence.""",,,,
