* **mobile responsive design** (your site shouldn't look crappy on smartphones and tablets

Dave Chappelle on stage: He had a really calm and relaxed demeanor. He was completely lucid and wasn't going to let anything bother him. Any time someone would shout something or heckle him he didn't respond with emotion or anger.  At one point in the show he even smoked a cigarette on stage. A few times he checked his text messages. He made it clear he wouldn't let anything bother him (Even though it seemed like this was extremely hard to accomplish). Later in the show he mentioned that his son was in the audience and said he was staying up on stage to teach a lesson to his son. He said that the more he got heckled

The audience: Terrible. Absolutely rude and obnoxious. For the most part, ect. This might sound flattering at first, but it gets really fucking annoying when your 30 minutes into the show and people are still yelling this type of shit. Sometimes people would yell things that didn't even make sense. Any moment of silence was seen as an opportunity by an audience member to yell something stupid. You also had the bad audience members that would yell at him to get off the stage or ""Tell some jokes so we can enjoy ourselves"". Chappelle simply laughed it off and told them they could leave. 

Chappelle was the last to perform and he was slated as a ""surprise guest"". Already 5 or 6 other comedians went before him without any incidences. When he was introduced and walked on stage everyone stood up clapping and cheering. Only comedian I've ever seen that was greeted with a standing ovation. It seemed like it would be the start of a great show but that wasn't the case. I was really disappointed at how the audience was acting. Chappelle couldn't talk for a few seconds without getting interrupted by some idiot yelling some the crowd. It's impossible to perform comedy under these circumstances. 

Once crowd sat down

It was clear that all the cameras recording his every reaction bothered him but he tried his best to let it not get to him. Comedians usually dislike being recorded and always request that people not film them before the shows as was the case here. Chappelle pleaded with the audience on a few occasions to put the cameras away. He mentioned that he didn't want to make his big comeback on youtube.That didn't stop the audience though.

As I said before, Chappelle offered them the mic to say whatever they wanted. He pointed it right at them and told them to speak up. This shut them up for a little while but they started back up later on in the show. 

I wondered why this couple hadn't been kicked or escorted out of the show since they were the primary agitators and were completely obnoxious. Turns out they were part of the Seminole tribe that owned the Casino where he was performing at. Go figure.

I have to go to work now but I will added more details and answer questions later on. 

TLDR: The crowed was very large and would not stop yelling random things. It was like everyone was trying to get some type of reaction or attention from Chappelle. He was suppose to perform for 22 minutes,False,,t5_2qrp8,False,,,t3_ixrg0

If you're gonna charge $62 bucks for a ticket

But for the most part,700 drunk, mostly white upper-class frat idiots, is kind of a bad idea.

People yelled out everything. Dumb Chappelle quotes, and everything in between. At one point, he started talking about movies, so the crowd just started yelling out random movie titles and he'd give opinions on them.

At any other comedy show, so he'd have just been standing there chainsmoking. So while the crowd yelling out shit kinda ruined the show, Chappelle helped it happen because he enabled it instead of discouraging it.

Then there was the flip side. Every time some idiot would yell out something

Not to say it wasn't funny...during the times the crowd actually shut the fuck up, but there's a time and place for doing that and last night wasn't it. But I was definitely laughing a lot.

All in all, I'll be damn if I even think about going again unless he has a set of actual material and is willing to put his foot down and tell the crowd to stop taking over the show.

In the end, it was Chappelle's fault entirely. He could have put a stop to it and the show would have been a lot more enjoyable for everybody. But he didn't. Probably because if the crowd wasn't giving him things to talk about, he wouldn't have had anything to say. Almost the entire show was just improvised bullshitting with people.

So yeah...it wasn't good...but it wasn't horrible either. It was just a really strange experience.",,t5_2qrp8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/uzuqy/my_review_of_dave_chappelles_standup_show_last/

This was from when O&amp;A were fired for airing comments from Homeless Charlie about how he wanted to rape Laura Bush

""This radio censorship bullshit has got to stop.

Today Opie and Anthony, here is the offending clip…

http://www.breitbart.tv/?p=450

I have to say something about this because I think it is terrible, who are supposed to defend civil liberties, but seem only to do so when the rights of peole with their views are threatened. It makes me really really sick. So I’m goign to say somethign about it. Now I’m going to warn you that I am a terrible writer when I am not writing comedy or dialogue. What follows will be meandering and repetitive and rife with bad spelling and run-on sentances. This is not what I do and I’m only doing it because I think I have to and anyway it’s my website so fuck off if you don’t like it…

One thing I have heard ad nauseum is that this is not censorship because the government didn’t do it. I don’t understand why so many people say this. It doesn’t have to be government censorship to be censorship. If anyone silences anyone because what they said pissed someone off, we live in a country where corporations run everything and have the government at their beck and call and vice verca. The two are fucking each other in the fetid cunt all day long. So in that world it doesn’t really matter who wielded the axe.

I’ve also heard people say that XM was merely excerizing their right to take these guys off the air because they objected to what was said on their service. The idea that this company is suspending O and A because they are concerned or offended by what they said is a joke. It’s just not the case. they suspended them because other people were offended and applied pressure. I know this because I have been on their show numerous times and MUCH worse things were said about all kinds of people

THAT is what is at stake here. Now, I whole-heartedly disagree with the deplorable nature of the rape jokes, bla bla bla.” I’m sorry I can’t do that. Because I listened to this clip and it made me laugh. I am a man who hates all violence. I am a man who believes rape is the very worst possible crime. I think it’s worse than murder because murder can actually be justified in certain cases. No one has ever raped in self defense. So yes, rape is horrible. Not just rape of women, by the way, rape of boys too. (rape of men does not exist) \BUt is joking about rape wrong? IN MY OPINION, no way. SO I was not offended by what was said on their show. I think it’s important that I tell you this because the entire point here is that people can interpret things differently. Some people are offended and some aren’t. The reason it’s wrong to take someone off the air for what they said, is because even though you might think what they said is wrong

I thought the clip was funny.

I also think it’s kind of fucked up how everyone quotes this guy saying “I’d like to fuck that bitch” about condeleeza rice, about a homeless man saying “I’d like to fuck that bitch” in regards to that stupid fucking cynical Iraqi-baby-eating-with-a-smile cunt Condeleeza??? And Laura Bush? When he said “I would fuck her to death.” I laughed my ass off. these are horrible people who are ruining the country. And the queen is a proud member of a horrible, horrible family that has been eating poor people for centuries. If some guy who lives in a box in this cruel and wrongful nation can’t have a fantacy about fucking the first lady, then what is this world coming to?""",,False,,True,t3_qql8q

Hello again. I had the distinct pleasure of meeting you earlier this week after your appearance at The Apple Sisters show. I was wearing the Powell's Books shirt (you're right, I love books and all but I'm no Burgess Meredith).

I work in sports television for a living and have dealt with superstar athletes for all of my adult life. Getting starstruck is a rare occurrence. But upon meeting you

In the few words I was able to intelligibly spit out

But the most influential performance of yours was from one of your monthly shows at Largo in which you discussed the issues you had with being envious with the success of your peers and your difficulty dealing with that. I've experienced similar feelings throughout my career, there were things in my life that I found the strength to confront, reexamine and then change as a result of you sharing your struggle and (what I hope) subsequent triumph.

I was in a rush Monday evening so I deeply regret that I wasn't able to linger and speak with you more. I anxiously await the opportunity to meet you again and

Again, gracious and for helping light the way.

Sincerely
Nick Zacharczuk

PS - Here is a picture of the show card you signed for me. Thanks again!

Nothing in comedy is absolute, this is the shit I wish I had known when I started.

1) It helps to get familiar with pot and alcohol.

It's not about the creative stimulation, and get high. Breaking the law together is a bonding experience. If you're the mc, and you get the headliner stoned, guess who he's going to request the next time he comes back to the club?

Drinking is similar. It lowers inhibitions and makes casual conversation easier. When you first start out, the more money you spend at the bar, the more the bartender/waitstaff is going to like you. And they have enormous pull with the who gets booked. Obviously, if you're broke or a recovering alcoholic, this may not be possible - it's far from mandatory - it'll just take a little longer. But if you're the type of person who drinks anyway - it'll help to shift your alcohol budget toward the bar you need to be at anyway.

2) But don't be a fucking idiot about it.

Don't deal drugs out of the club. Don't get shithammered and pick a fight with the doorman, a comic isn't an artist, they're an employee. Are you going to hire someone who's a total fuckup? Match your debauchery to the level of the person you're trying to impress. Drink if they're drinking, smoke if they're smoking - but never be more fucked up than they are.

3) Network all you can

If you're an open micer, there's nothing you're going to say that makes them go ""I'm gonna take this guy under my wing and make him famous.""

You can generally network one level above you. If you're an open micer, but don't bug him or try to talk shop).

4) Err on the side of caution.

If you're pushy and annoying, because their early fuckups got them stuck in open mic hell for five or more years with no chance of moving up. When in doubt, it's better to have someone saying ""I wish he'd hang out more often"" than ""god I wish he'd leave me alone.""

5) Don't ask to move up.

This advice from the old alt.comedy.standup message board, and consistent enough to maintain it for months or years. If you're truly exceptional, *someone* will notice. It'll be other open micers at first, then the staff, and eventually the club owner will need an mc and you'll be there. If you corner a club owner and start nagging for work, he's going to resent you for putting him on the spot. If you're not at the point where others voluntarily want to see more of you, you're not where you need to be yet.

6) Don't look down on other comics

As an amatuer comic who wants to get paid, and a some points they'll be way more important than being funny. If you see a successful comic, and you hate his material, you need to figure out what else he's doing, and learn from that.

I have this individuals reddit username, but I'm deciding to leave it where our conversation ended last night.  He said he got the jokes from his friend, he deleted the information from his page, and said he would never tell them on stage.  Obviously I have no way of confirming this but I have to hope I can take his word for it.  I WILL further pursue this if this happens with this person again.  I can promise you that.  And I think anyone that has been doing this any period of time, joke thievery can destroy you and the relationships you have worked to build.  Yes I know there are always going to be people that steal jokes, but they don't last long (Excluding Mencia).  

So I caution all of you out there creating original content.  I know the feedback is fun to hear from people who love comedy

And a final warning to the person who I know will see this post, because it is what we have worked so hard to create.  I don't want to have to take this any further, but I will if it means protecting what allows me to make money and get paid to perform.  Don't tell them on stage and we won't have a problem.
