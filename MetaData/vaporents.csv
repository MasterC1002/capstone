1373541452.0,1i2nv0,Debunking the 'small hits are more efficient' myth,electrophile91,133,14,54,"Almost every day on vaporents I see some allusion to the fact that bigs hits are inefficient. People claim the mflb is the most efficient vape because it forces you to take multiple small hits. People scoff at 'clouds' because they must be wasteful. Visible vapor is wasted vapor, first a set of knowledge


So without further delay. A dose of THC is roughly 5mg. It may be as large as, but for the purposes of this thought experiment a 5mg THC dose is to be considered. This 5mg of THC produces approximately 5ml of THC vapor, 5ml of CO2 and 20ml of other cannabinoids and gas-phase resins. Assuming a hit to be approximately 1 litre in size (a rather conservative estimate), and that the whole dose is vaporisable in one hit, newly formed gases make up approximately 3% of your hit, approximatey 1/3rd of which is THC. Your lungs have a surface area of 70 square metres. 


So far, as well as the capability of vast uptake via your blood's plasma proteins. There are no ""THC-transporter"" cells. This means that from the point of view of each THC molecule, there is no queue. No THC molecules are turned around by any others. They are all free to enter into your body. A study on the Volcano vaporizer ([link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16637053)) determined that after 10s, 65% of inhaled THC was absorbed. That is to say, 35% of THC is exhaled after 10s. This is nice, because it corresponds with the e-folding time; making the construction of **[this graph](http://i.imgur.com/ItLgkNz.png)** incredibly easy. As with any natural concentration-dependent process, where there is no speed-limit apart from the rate of diffusion - this decrease of THC in the lungs must be characterised by an exponential decay. (Wiki quote from the page on exponential decay: ""It is found that many administered substances are distributed and metabolize according to exponential decay patterns""). As a result, whether your hit was tiny or huge. So the fraction of wasted THC is independent of dose, is that you cannot stop elimination of THC


So why does 1 big hit involve more visible exhaled vapor than 20 small hits? Visible vapor is a result of the saturation state of the air. The bigger the hit the more saturated the air, 'pushing' the THC into the blood, at a rate faster than indicated by the graph. This is unknown, but a possibility. It does not mean that more THC has been wasted.
I understand this goes against the grain and welcome any scientific argument against it. Until such time, because they ain't (as long as they've held it down for a bit). Most importantly, which can be seen from the graph, is how much more effective 20 seconds of 'holding' are compared to 5. Hold your hits people. 

**tl;dr there's no reason why small hits are more efficient than big hits

1361988399.0,19c8d6,MFLB vs Pax: What you need to know,vapin,67,4,46,"Correct me if I'm wrong but these seem to be the 2 most popular and highest rated handheld vapes on the market right now. I have them both and I really love them both for different reasons.

Convenience is huge for all portable vapes. I give the edge to the MFLB because although you do have to bring batteries and you do need a finer grind (MF finishing grinder works GREAT and fits right onto the chamber; loading the Pax is a pain in the ass and is messy.) My 2 main reasons for choosing the MFLB are the quick heating (4-5 seconds) and the ability to take one puff at a time. Pax is more for sessions and it's just not plausible to get more than 2 out of the oven (3 if you're a real lightweight i guess.) Point: MFLB

Vapor Quality definitely goes to the Pax. Although both give me very satisfying hits that fulfill my desire to smoke

Stealth is super important to me. Edge Pax, and has a viewable chamber. Point : Pax.

Novelty would have to go to the MFLB. This is a super cool

Reliability is a huge factor I think. The Pax cost me 267 dollars with tax at my local head shop and within 1 week the mouth piece was not always recognizing and I'm still constantly fidgiting with it to make contact. I also get pretty nasty gunk out of it when i clean it every few days and as a stoner I'm annoyed that I'll have to pick up new cleaning products soon. The MFLB is so simple and I know the batteries don't last terribly long but it works exactly how it's supposed to. The Pax has been out long enough and costs enough money that they should have improved this and they also should have produced accessories by now. Edge: MFLB

ABV quality goes hands down to MFLB because you can absolutely control how dark it gets. Both can combust

You may think I'm going to give it away to the MFLB here but I'm not. 4-2 in my categories

Hope this helps any new vapor ents! Happy Vaping!!!!



TLDR: Both products kick ass but if you can afford either but only one take the Pax.

* At the end of a session don't close the mouth piece until the unit is cool completely. This stops gunk from cementing around the mouth piece area causing it to stick. So power off the pax by letting it sit in standby until it powers it self down.

* Clean the inner tube with moist( NOT DRIPPING WET) pipe cleaner that has been dampened with 90%+ iso alcohol. 

* If the temperature color flickers when you have the mouth piece in and the pax is clean

* Though its recommended the oven be full i have had success with half packs. You just need to tamp and stir the material a couple times in the session. Also be aware the clouds will be smaller and the herb may vape faster.

**Edit 1:** 

* Keep the pax mouth piece facing up/vertical when device is hot. This prevents gunk from getting to the mouth piece. 

* To clean the mouth piece good

* Over time the screen will collect stuff. ISO and steel wool and q tips can get it looking new. 

* Get higher quality pipe cleaners. The on the PAX came with seemed to leave fuzzies behind in the tube while cleaning. ",self,t5_2upjd,1360011881.0,,pax-blk,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/17vh0f/tips_for_new_pax_users/

Anyway, and especially proof that you don't need a bulky home setup to get just as high. 

Anyway, clear, fun, and I was high as balls in those days. After years of smoking, the combustion high really loses much of it's flavor, and it rarely stays in your head long enough (depending on the bud and tolerance of course). I even got pretty bored of that particular high, because it didn't really bring me much joy anymore. 

So, and most of my friends smoke, I had to make them as enthusiastic about vaping as I am. It's weird getting your vape out and not passing joints after all these years. I must say that I've had quite some succes: 4 of my friends have bought a vape because I ""converted"" them. They haven't entirely made the switch, but it's getting more and more ""normal"" to get the vape out. Which is nice. 

I love sharing the vape experience

However, that's not my business, but what really annoys me is the following, and I'm sure a lot of you ents will relate:

They take a drag, and then complain that you don't get high *off a few little puffs* What did you expect, Sherlock? It's still green... I think it's mostly weird for them to not taste the smoke. Worst part is that I can't even let them finish the bowl, because by then they'll be rolling a joint.

Yesterday this happened again

Also, make sure the bottom left of any banner isn't likely to make it difficult to see the header.  

I'll probably keep experimenting with banners, being clean and clear (certainly relative to smoke). So I might look for a few more clouds, though I have a couple of other ideas as well.  And in the fullness of time, more CSS will be added, which will mean more imagery, too.

1360666151.0,18de9h,Oil caps made from your vape cleanings and AVB.  You're going to want to know this!,Ialmostthewholepost,50,9,37,"**UPDATED!!!**

Edit for Directions Insertion!:

Alright, put my name on it, or try to say it was all my own idea.  But I am going to give you the directions, that's for sure.

First off, the occasional edible from the dispensary, a coffee grinder as my main grinder (I have a very simple 2 piece for my smokables), and the piece de resistance, a 3rd gen Arizer Extreme Q.  I use it with a whip attachment that allows me to play Forza and puff away.

I'm also like most MMJ patients in that I am broke as fuck, every time.  And with this experiment, I was able to do just that.

There's a couple parts to this

**Part 1: Clean that Muthafucking vape!**

I mean all of it.  What you're going to want to do is ensure you're using the right materials.  I use a glass Mason jar filled with 99% pure Isopropyl alcohol.  Keep it in there.  Don't get rid of it.  This is your bath for your vape parts, that is just small enough to fit in the little hat / elbow filter, and twirl around.  This means that I can also use this piece for cleaning almost all of my parts, except hoses.  For those, if they need agitation, I use a long pipecleaner concoction that I made by braiding them into a 2 foot long master pipecleaner.  This makes sure it can reach past the middle of both of my whips, so I can clean it from both ends.

Once my vape is dirty, both screens, the elbow piece, and any connectors go into the bath, along with my cleaning tool.  They soak for as long as needed in the bath, usually 15 to 60 minutes depending on how lazy I am.  Then, clean them with whatever you do - I use my little q-tip ended tool to wipe the inside of the bowl. scrub the screens, use a pipecleaner to clean the small end of the elbow.  After this, you can also clean the vape pieces by pouring Iso into them

I then clean my hoses as well in the same manner, I use the master pipecleaner to agitate and fully clean, then rinse that off, as well as my tools, into the bath.

Cleaning is done!

**Part 2:  Saving AVB**

Pretty self explanatory, and shaped it to fit my vape parts.  Now, I know that you're thinking I just use it for cleaning, but it does have another purpose.  Dry cleaning.  No, not the clothes.

What I do is take my little q-tip tool, I use my **dry** q-tip thingy to *wipe* the inside of the bowl to get all of the bits out, and then I clean out the top hat with it as well, as this thing fits perfectly.  I just put it into the little hat, and spin it in my fingers to clean it out.  

This has a couple of benefits:

-It keeps your bowl cleaner for longer
-Your fresh bowl will taste better.
-You'll be able to save the kief/small bits that get otherwise get stuck in q-tip.  
-There's no waste.  In the last year of using this tool

Now that you're saving all of your AVB

**Part 3: Cooking!**

Now that you've got a jar of Iso that couldn't take another washing (you'll know when this happens - it will neither pass light through it

**First:** Take all of your AVB and powder it.  More surface area exposed, make sure it is nicely mixed up, and then it's time to strain.

**Second:** Strain it all.  You may need a second set of hands depending on your set up, take your Iso bath and strain it through a doubled up coffee filter.  Doubled so that it's stronger, and a coffee filter to make sure you get the fine particles.  Then again make sure to squeeze as much as you can into your bath, reclaiming as much of the liquid as possible.

**Third:**  Make a double boiler, and slowly add more bath.  This does take some time, and the alcohol part is not the best smelling when heated.  I advise doing this outside if possible, or at least make sure your workspace is well ventilated, and of course WATCH THE FUCK OUT, IT'S 99% ALCOHOL.  Avoid smoking a bowl ANYWHERE near this.

**Fourth:** After the liquid has evaporated, you can evaporate it off using the double boiler again.  If you use it on the outside of the container, the goo will heat and slide easier.  I use an old credit card for scraping it down the edges, then boil off the water again, and while heated, transfer to it's final resting space.

**Fifth:**  Your end result should be a dark brown goo with **NO** liquidy parts.  You do not want **ANY** Iso or water in this, but it should be very thick.

**Sixth:**  Cap that stuf up.  I use a spoon to scoop the goo out of the container, and using the lighter make sure that it is pliable enough to all come off while ensuring the spoon doesn't become heated to the point of vaporizing  or burning the goo.  If you hear crackling, you're burning it.

**Seventh:** Enjoy the fruit of your labour.  Start small.  My first few doses were just a drop

**Eighth and Final:**  Keep them in the fridge, make sure you consume.

I have been surviving on these caps **ALONE** since the 27th of last month.  By the time I run out, no kief, no hash, no other edibles.  And that time has been spent superdosing on a lot of days to test these out.  I likely could have made them last double that if I had tried.  Next time.  Pfffffttt..... right....   I usually have to vape or smoke for migraines, as edibles usually don't have enough THC in them to actually kill my migraines, just lessen them slightly.  For me to have survived this long without smoking or vaping has been a nice break.  I had saved my bath for about 8 months, and only added 1 ounce of AVB as I had just finished making edibles out of my saved AVB the month previous.  I would like to add a lot more next time to reclaim more CBD/CBN for body pain, right?

Anyway

***********************************************************************************

Why you ask?  Because

But wait!  Billy Mays here with another exciting - hooooooooly fuck did my fingers just fing or was that my tablet's screen - discovery.  I can't write the guide to this tonight.  But I promise to amend this in the morning or afternoon.  

I'm a MMJ patient with a ridiculous tolerance.  Last time I was orbiting like this I had eaten an ounce of very potent AVB over the course if several hours.  This is  better.  What I have done is use every part of the buffalo when it comes to my Extreme Q and AVB stash, most potent oil, which is of course orally bioavailable.  And then cap them.  Typical dose for me has been about 1g in a ""00"" capsule.  And they are AMAZING.  I will not be going to any other method at this point as these are the most punch per size unit ever.  And talk about stealth, provided you have the space to prep them.

And you may ask, they're usually daily and not good.  But these caps just kick it's ass.  And one cap lasts me 18 to 24 hours.  Think of the potential for those of you with a significantly lower tolerance, small caps with a mere drop of oil for less time (I prefer to overload receptors and let it process overnight for that nice happy day after).

Hello Vaporents!


As promised, and the ensuing communication trail in the interests of transparency.


First off, and we've included the letter further down.  The second avenue is via Massdrop.com.  We urge all of you interested to go to MassDrop and register (easy as entering an email and password), and then vote for interest in the Arizer Solo.  They currently sit at 111 interested people, and I've posted a link back to what we're doing here should people on MassDrop not want to wait and join us.


If MassDrop comes through within our timeframe, a group buy works best when the number of people is increased.  We have the ability to either influence MassDrop considerably, or to at least get a retailer to work with us as we currently represent around $3000 in sales for one business in one action.  This is a great opportunity for a business to get a decent bump in revenue for a day.

After organizing my thoughts


*Greetings!*


*I'm writing to you on behalf of /r/vaporents


*Our community is located at http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents*


*For the sake of transparency:*


*Our discussion thread gauging interest in a group buy - http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1k42uq/looking_to_gather_interest_in_another_group_buy/*


*Our official discussion thread on the group buy in a nutshell -*


*Currently, things grow.  We're hoping to increase the number of buyers to at least 75 to 100 people during that time, which with our various related communities is much more than possible.  As we're a community of enthusiasts, we will of course be doing our own version of internal advertising and raising awareness for this group buy, as everyone knows that getting more people involved allows you, the retailer, to work with us to create an optimal price.*


*Again, the below is a quick explanation of our selection process.*


*We will be writing to a variety of retailers to give you the opportunity to give us your best price on our current amount of registered buyers


*As this is a group buy and we have members internationally, so this is a very important aspect to this.  We have also had some interest from a couple members in Australia.  Our ideal retailer will have few challenges regarding international shipping to common First World countries.*


*At the end of the two week period


*We should also mention that the last time we decided to do this as a community


*If you are interested in a mutually beneficial relationship, so if you have the ability to provide us with some package deals that might include some basics, like a fine grinder, pass through charger, water filtration, or the like, or even a discount process for this


*We will be posting all communications so that the registrants are able to see everything clearly to avoid confusion


*To sum up


*1. Best price on 2013 model (M1A4 serial numbered) Arizer Solo.*

*2. Ability to ship internationally to USA, and within the European Union.*

*3. A retailer who might be able to provide a couple basic accessory packages.  We can consult our community to determine these if need be.*


*Our apologies for the long email, and we look forward to hearing from you!*


*If you have any questions


*Sincerely

*""MyName/Ialmostthewholepost""*

*Email: myname@gmail.com*
*Reddit User Link: http://www.reddit.com/u/ialmostthewholepost*


*PS - One of our members has posted this information up the FuckCombusion.com forums for further visibility -http://fuckcombustion.com/threads/arizer-solo.3833/page-701*


**If you have any input on the letter, or are a retailer and are interested in supporting this, please post up or PM.**  


Those that have expressed interest have been noted


With that said, or when I get up the next morning.  From there, I will be posting a thread on here with the top 3 prices/offers that we get, and then we as a community will vote on the retailer that we choose.  Again, if MassDrop is cheaper and on by that time, we will go that route.  I personally cannot wait any longer, hence why I'm taking this project on.  On Monday August 26th, unless we the community decide earlier.  Then


**Help spread the word.  Mention it in threads where people are looking at getting a vaporizer, but if it gets me a good price on a little brother for the EQ, then I'm all for it.**


Thank you all for your interest in this

Edit:  **Just to be clear

1.  **Looking for retailers and gathering interest from now until August 25th!**

2.  **You will be purchasing from a retailer directly

3.  **To register, and updating the number at the top of the thread of the total interest received via reddit thusfar.**

4.  **Any and all retailer communication as well as retailers contacted will be included in this thread for transparency.  All retailers are encouraged to compete.**

5.  **Once the 25th comes around

6.  **WE ORDER OUR SOLO'S DIRECT FROM RETAILER WITH EXISTING STOREFRONT AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS.  NO INTERACTION WITH REDDITORS OR OTHER NON SAFE METHODS OF PURCHASE.  WE NEED THIS TO BE LEGIT, I'm doing this to *save my money*.  That's how much this is worth it to me.**

1372147395.0,1h0yo5,Does anyone else strongly dislike using the MFLB?,_quote,52,17,87,"Warning: get ready for a wall of text

Disclaimer: while I am about to voice my complaints about the launch box, I am curious to hear from launch box lovers why they don't take offense to the things that I do, and maybe some of you can give me some tips on how I could enjoy the launch box more. 

Background: The launch box was my first vape and there have been long periods of time when I used it exclusively. I have never particularly enjoyed using it for the reasons which I am about to describe. I now use an Arizer Solo.

Let's jump right in. Things I dislike about the launch box:

The fact that the screen only vaporizers the bud that is in direct contact with it, I have to pour out the trench in my palm and crumble it all up with my fingers. Along with this being a hassle for various reasons (wind, getting hands smelly, etc) I lose a bit of bud each time I do this, so even if I started out with a full trench I am left with much less bud in the trench than I should have. In the end, it is just unnerving because I never feel like I've vaped a whole trench to completion.

Going along with that first point

Having to control the temperature with the speed of my breath. I am actually okay with the way that the launch box works, or just making it fly around in the trench. I think that it is extremely misleading that the launch box manual tells you to do all three of these things as follows:

1. Take hits that last 12-14 seconds

2. Draw like you are sipping tea

3. Do not draw faster than what will move the bud around in the trench. The bud should be stationary

You just can't do all of those. The only way to take a 14 second hit without combusting is to draw hard

And the most annoying part of the whole breath regulated thing is, if you inhale too slowly for an extended period of time, your weed will go up in flames. I want to this post to be as neutral as possible, but for this I have to step out of line. That is fucking retarded.

So yep, the magic flight launch box can burn your weed. If you get too high and your concentration dwindles a little, or you hand your launch box to an inexperienced friend, it can char up your screen and fill the lungs of the user with foul, dirty, harmful smoke. Enough said.

That’s basically it. All in all, along with the fact that I have absolutely none of those issues with any digital portable like the Solo and the no2, I pretty much don’t use the launch box anymore. 

TL;DR: just read it. It takes 2 minutes.

Sorry if I complained a bit enthusiastically. Again, the iolite or the pax. It's just the process of using the launch box that is extremely agitating to me. In a nutshell, using it feels like work. And the whole point of vaping weed is to not feel like you're doing work.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1h0yo5/does_anyone_else_strongly_dislike_using_the_mflb/

The Anker is a portable battery with a 1.35mm DC connector that will fit in to your Pax charging station. It also has the option to output either DC 9V or 12V (Pax uses 9V.) Great! Well, and uses a right angle plug. My solution: get a PVC cutter (a saw will work best), saw off a small portion of your charging unit and boom, portable Pax charger. I don't see any concern for voiding the Pax's warranty as I haven't modified the Pax in any way, just the method in which the charging station receives power (Pax has publicly stated any 9V adapter can be used.) Total cost ~$60 (Anker + PVC cutter.)

Here's a couple photos of my Pax charging from the Anker

1356981545.0,15qipx,Review of the Puffit Discrete Vape,itsturningred,39,7,4,"http://i.imgur.com/AgcUw.jpg

Right off the bat

I have always been a big proponent for vaporizers

First off the piece is very subtle, so when I first saw this, my first thought was to take it on the slopes and it was just what I hoped for. By holding the top button for 2 seconds, the Puffit initiates a 20-30 second burn sequence. My only worry was how badly did the Puffit create odors and I was surprised to find that it barely leaves a trail behind and the only way it leaves an obvious smell is if you initiate the burn sequence and someone is standing right next to you for more than 15 seconds. After the burn sequence is finished there is no smell, there is no smoke after you exhale and it does not smell after you're finished exhaling. So outside use is great, if you're ballsy enough you could use it in front of people and if prompted you could say you're using your inhaler. I've used it in the presence of people in the same room and no one bats an eye. No lighters needed!

The Puffit can hold a little less than a gram, if you're trying to get wasted. I prefer a quick pick me up over a blunt any day, I don't like getting smashed, so this is perfect for when you take a hit off of a larger piece at home (I have the Hot Box vape), then taking the Puffit with you to sort of ride that high throughout the day. 

You must charge this device in order to use it. The charge can last for about 7-10 uses when fully charged. It takes about 2 hours to charge this, it's just as easy. 

Some more notes: The product comes with a soft carrying case, though the font is very dark and you must hold it very closely to read this, so that does not give anything away (the inhaler is matte black and the font is black too).

**TL;DR** I'd recommend this to anyone that's looking for a way to be able to have a personal puff anywhere you would like

Anyway, and got nothing from either attempt. Edibles have been hit or miss in the past for me so I made a 2g avb firecracker and gave it to my gf who usually would be blasted from a .5g regular edible and she said she never felt anything either so I don't think it's just me.

After that I figured if people are getting results from eating a gram or two straight I could probably do something like that so I decided to just try to 'go big or go home' I guess to make up for my dark brown and dumped 6-7gs into a milkshake and downed it and honestly never felt a thing all day. All these attempts I feel like I did everything right, which I see is pretty popular for capsules, but would that help edibles at all? I'd always heard that unless you burn it there should always be something left, but could I really need more than a 1/4 oz?

The last week or two I've been dumping my bowls when they start to get into light-medium brown territory, but I've got over an ounce of this dark brown AVB and would really appreciate any tips to get something out of it.

For those of you who haven't it is basically just simmering your stems in milk on the stove and it makes an extremely potent cup of milk with similar effects of hash edibles.

I thought this sounded like a great idea so I decided to make an exact recipe for those of you who have dirty stems and want a potent cup of hot chocolate.

What you need:
First you need a dirty stem. As for the amount of resin
You need a stove and a small pot.
A strainer and a spoon.
A coffee mug full (about 2 cups) of full fat milk or I use half 2% milk and half cream. The more fat content the better here!
And finally some hot chocolate mix.

The recipe:
Okay so first what I do is measure out my milk in a coffee mug so I know exactly how much I need for my cup of hot chocolate. Remember that some is going to evaporate so pour in a little extra.

Next your going to pour the milk into the pot/sauce pan and get it to a light simmer. After it is simmering throw your stem(s) in the pot and start stirring. Never stop stirring because milk can burn super easily. Do this for about 5 minutes or until all the oil is gone from your stem and floating in the milk. Take out the stem and stir until the oil is evenly mixed into the milk

Also if your not a fan of hot chocolate you can try something else here
Be careful with this recipe ents!! It is extremely potent!!! If you don't have a high tolerance split it with a friend or don't wait for the stem to get super resinated.

I smoke around 6-10 solo stems per day so this was a perfect edible for me. It kept me at a [7] for 5 hours. And it also tastes great!!

1368709355.0,1eg4xv,PUFFiT Tips for disgruntled consumers. (x-post r/trees),wolfman1414,30,1,8,"Puffit Tips

Hello to all my fellow Ents.

I recently decided to try a new form of enjoying our favorite past time and bought myself a Puffit personal vaporizer. My main reason for buying this specific vape was discretion. Many people reading this probably disagree with this purchase

My initial reaction was one of curiosity. It felt like nothing was being ""smoked, not long after the first session, I was getting less and less high and was quite upset, thinking I had bought a $150 paperweight. 

That's when I started doing some research. And, producing just visible vapor clouds and taking me to the moon.

So

1. Clean your Puffit. 
This is essential

Follow the instructions in this video to properly clean your device.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4bLamOBvsk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

Note: I only followed the first cleaning directions and got great results later that night.                                             

2. Use the spring enhancement attachment.
That is important to keep your herb compacted nicely and to help heat it up

3. Grind your tree FINE. 
And I mean FINE. Leave your herb in the grinders longer for better results when vaping. 

4. Use dry herb. 
While everyone loves sticky tree
                                
5. Heat up the Puffit before loading it.
Go through the process of blinking red-green-orange-red lights five time before loading the chamber. The Puffit will already be heated up and won't waste herb by getting to the proper temperature. 

6. Vape at a heat setting of 6.5.
This was the best for me.
                                            
7. After heating it up first
Then

8. Pull SLOWLY. 
10 seconds draws at least. Then

9. Clean the screen in the chamber after every session. 
This ensures that the next time you go

And that's it. I followed these steps just last night and I definitely went to the moon. And this was only after 5-6 hits.

If you're having issues

P.S. The vapor that I got is very imperceptible to the naked eye, very ideal. The best way to see how much vapor you exhale, hold up a cellphone flashlight close to your mouth when you exhale, and voila; clouds of vapor.",,False,self,False,t3_1eg4xv

1368493636.0,1ea8ls,A question for you guys... can you describe to me the difference you feel between a head high (from sativa being vaped) and a body high (from smoking blunts of indica),Chridsdude,31,4,26,"So I've only ever smoked blunts and a few times pipes... and I always had a way better high using a pipe. The only bud I can find is usually indica heavy. Have any of you gone from smoking blunts allday errday of mostly indica to trying a vape of sativa bud? Can you describe it?

I'm asking because since I've started smoking I always yearned for a head high where I could listen to music and appreciate it and basically have a good creative type high to draw or write or something... but all I ever get is body highs where my body is weird feeling and I feel uncomfortable walking around. Then I just get lazy and couch-lock activates for a while...

When I get my own apartment I will get a vape for sure... but for now I can't get one. Can you describe to me in detail what it was like your first time? What's it often like when you get high? I'm very curious and excited because in a few years I'll have the privilege of experiencing what I've always wanted to get from weed!!... because after a while it's just not really that fun anymore to have body highs all the time.

EDIT: Thanks you guys... I guess I'm just gonna stick to using pipes because they've always given me a clearer high and I don't even get any anxiety... later on I'll see if I get some 80% sativa or some shit from silk road,False,self,t5_2upjd,1368565223.0,,,t3_1ea8ls

I used 150ml of a VG/PG mix for an oz of bud and it was too weak

You need the following: (I bought all my stuff on Amazon

1. Small slow cooker
2. Cheesecloth
3. Vegetable Glycerin
4. Propylene Glycol
5. Everclear or very very high proof alcohol (I don't think 151 will do it because we're going to cook off all the ethanol



Step 1. Decarb your bud. (this is cooking 101, and cook it for 30 mins. it's a chemical thing, look up why you have to if you don't know already. Fair warning, this is a very smelly process)

Step 2. Grind up and toss your decarbed bud into the slow cooker. Add in enough everclear to cover and then some. If you have any abv, stirring every once in a while, adding more everclear as needed. We are making an ethanol tincture here. The reason I used ethanol (drinking alcohol) was that in my research, I read that the type of alcohol in VG or PG is not the proper solvent to dissolve THC and CBDs. The overall strength of the alcohol tincture is not important at this point since we'll be cooking off all the ethanol later. 

Intermediate step: I was reading someone's recipe for budder an he said that he froze inbetween heating cycles to let ice crystals break the cell walls. I may incorporate that technique into my next batch. 

Step 3. Using the cheesecloth over a bowl

Step 4. Mix your PG and VG. You can go straight VG if you want or straight PG. I believe mixing the two at a 8:2 ratio (PG at 8

Step 5. Clean out your slow cooker. Combine the alcohol extraction and the VG/PG. Set slow cooker to high. The avg temp of a slow cooker at high is still under 200 degrees. Ethanol boils off at 180. Let the ethanol boil off for a while

Optional step. If you haz hash

Once the ethanol has boiled off you're done. Load it into any refillable cartomizer. If you've purchased a flavor pack

1357968575.0,16facj,My ABV recipe - coconut oil and soy lecithin.,Bit_Chewy,30,4,14,"Here's a method I've been using for making cannaoil with my ABV

It's a variation on the techniques utilised by a certain BadKittySmiles, in this [massive sticky thread](http://forum.grasscity.com/incredible-edible-herb/742831-badkats-cannapharm-canna-caps-uv-reactive-glowing-hash-candy-canna-bombs-more.html).  If you're interested in the whys and wherefores, BKS explains reasons for doing things the way she does.

Anyway, as it needs no decarboxylation.  And I've reduced the potency dramatically, as BKS's recipes are designed with high-tolerance medical users in mind, and tend to be extremely strong.  

- I first grind my ABV in an electric grinder to reduce it to a floury powder

- Then I heat a suitable amount of [coconut oil](http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/images/productimages/66265/original_CW.jpg) (roughly enough to cover the ABV) in a small pot or other receptacle.  Sometimes I'll just use the coconut oil jar (heating it slowly and carefully), of course - I just haven't bothered to find anything suitable so far.

- Then I add 10-15% [soy lecithin](http://i.imgur.com/sRPiz.jpg), and coconut oil is very high in this.  And the lecithin is a natural emulsifier which significantly boosts the bioavailability of the cannabinoids (ie it makes your oil stronger).

- I then cook the oil/lecithin/abv mix for about 1/2 an hour at 120C/250F (which might longer than necessary), a double-boiler is another option, but water + oil all in the one pot (as per popular cannabutter recipes) won't work, as lecithin is soluble in *both* liquids.

- Then I add this oil to whatever food I like, rather than on an empty stomach, to avoid the [First Pass Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect).

I generally find that less than a gram of ABV's worth of this cannaoil (usually about 1-2 tsp) is quite enough to get me where I want to be.  And when I haven't had it for a while

The oil is also excellent in combination with vaping

The other day I was crunching some numbers and I discovered something quite interesting. 

I get stoned on my arizer solo usually once a week. If I buy a 10 (£10 worth of weed) it will last me about 6 weeks (As you use so little in each bowl

If I was to smoke it however the numbers are very different. My friends who smoke go through a 10 in 1 night so therefore costing them £10 a night (we will assume they smoke as often as me i.e. once a week)

In total then by buying an arizer solo I will be saving myself over £1000 (£1149 to be exact (that's over £1 every day)).

Then there is the cherry on the cake. Not only are you saving so much money but the high is more enjoyable and not sleepy, it is healthier, you are not using tabacco, you are not inhaling carcinogens and we didn't even factor in the costs of all the lighters/rizla/tobacco.

I also bought the Hydro Tube thats made for the Pinnacle Vaporizer since its a 14mm size.  

 The adapter is glass and is covered by a thick tube that fits perfectly snug over the PAX mouthpiece.

But from what i could remember
1)  Some people complained about when taking a draw from the PAX it feels restrictive and have a hard time taking a hit thatll fill up your lungs.  However when using this HydroTube Attachment you wont have that problem.... The hits are very easy to inhale with no sense of restriction.  
2)  Sometimes when using the PAX about 5-10Mins in the unit gets pretty hot and the vapor you inhale gets hot and burns your lips.  When using the hydro tube all the hits and extremely cool and it feels like you can inhale more.  
I recommend for best results you should inhale slowly from the hydro tube in a steady constant stream until your good.  You can lift up the hydro tube if you want to clear out the Tube but i dont feel its 100% necessary since its a small tube.

I watched the lights slowly sink to the bottom of the seat. I reached for it and grabbed it as quick as I could, but it wouldn't turn off. It stayed on, until the lights beeped a funny pattern, and everything died out.

Fast forward to almost 36 hours later (to nowish). The solo has sat in the middle of a 50lbs bag of rice for 24 hours

I let it charge for a few hours and just tried it again. SUCCESS! The thing is working like normal (for now). I was expecting to have to buy a new one pronto

1361773498.0,196gzy,How to: Pax by Ploom,vapin,26,3,2,"The Pax is a great tool for vaporizing loose leaf. I pack it so that my finger gets a little bit of resistance when I press it into the oven

1. Grind as fine as you can! I can't stress this enough... I have 2 grinders. I have a 70 dollar 4 piece crank grinder with a pollen catcher and I have a ""finishing"" 2 piece grinder by Aerospaced (12.99 at my local head shop) with only one chamber. The 2 piece finishing grinder is barely larger than a quarter and fits the PERFECT amount for the Pax oven. The Pax by Ploom is NOT satisfying at all without a good grind. They would do wonders by providing one at very little cost to them!

2. How to draw. When I describe how to hit my Pax to my friends, drawing it first into their mouth, and then inhaling instead of puffing. Sometimes 2 draws are better than one; 3-4 seconds in between allows for a decent amount of vapor to build back up in the oven. This method not only produces awesome vapor clouds indoor or outdoor, makes the restrictive draw much, much less bothersome (mouth draws are stronger than straight lung draws, for sure,) but also prevents the mouthpiece from getting hot the way long draws do. I get roughly 20-30 pretty decent hits off of that small oven and it definitely does the job!

3. Immediately after use, not hot, but still warm.) Make sure to get decent pipe cleaners and to defuzz them as much as possible with your index and thumb before using them on the inside of your Pax.

I hope this helps anybody who has a Pax and is having difficulty using it and I also hope this helps anyone looking to buy the Pax and who does not want that fun learning curve everyone talks about. The Pax by Ploom is the closest thing I've found to smoking a blunt; without the combustion of either the loose leaf or the tobacco leaf.

Here's my take on the recipe with some slight modifications and detailed instructions.

1. Grind up your ABV in a coffee grinder to powder
1. Place ABV powder in small ceramic container such as a mini crock (like those used in french onion soup).  Any small pyrex or ceramic container should work
1. Add coconut oil (heat it up to be liquid), add a little then stir, add a little more until it's no longer a batter but runs freely.
1. Add soy lecithin granules
1. Place pyrex or ceramic container in an empty crock pot on high.
1. Cover the crock pot and heat for 1 hour
1. Stir once then reduce heat on crock pot to low for another 5 hours stir a few times during this process to prevent hot spots.
1. **CONTAINER WILL BE HOT!** Carefully remove the ceramic or pyrex continer with a pot holder and transfer to a shallow dish for easy access
1. Using a spoon or needleless syringe fill gel capsules
1. Wipe down the completed capsules to remove excess oil

Notes: The finer you grind the ABV the easier it will be fill your capsules.  I suggest emptying the grinder

I had a bit of AVB in a glass jar (maybe 5 grams) and I was thinking about what to do with it. I know you can eat AVB (and smoke if you like). I was just thinking if I could come up with something else I can do with it. 

I noticed that my grinder almost perfecly fit the glass jar

What I got out of it was a ton of this brown kief looking stuff. I wasn't sure if it was worth anything so I put a tiny bit into my vape and tried it. Seems to work really well [7]. Has anyone else tried this?

And here's where most of my other friends misjudged the MFLB. With all this dank around


Most of my friends discarded the box as it 'doesn't work anymore', it's the perfect piece for a lot of situations, namely:

 

* Getting high*ER*. When I'm churning thru green
 


* Personal use. If I've had at least a day **or** heavy exercise (pretty common for me personally) since my last sesh, depending on where the endorphins are at.

 

* VACATION! I'm on it now, have for two weeks. And I'm okay with that! So long as I can take days off, **consistent use of only the magic flight brings my tolerance levels down to meet it**. It's ridiculously efficient as well, plus gel caps give me easy access to a different type of high thru instant edibles from ABV.
 


* Lastly, and sometimes not at all depending on outside factors.
 


Thanks for reading thru all this rant. [I saw a post that was similar to this but with an opposite thesis](http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1h0yo5/does_anyone_else_strongly_dislike_using_the_mflb/) a while back

**Vapor Central.** headed up to yonge st to check out what all the hype was about. 5 bucks gets you through the door. this includes bag rental for dozens of volcano vaporizers. they are all in good condition. it was an enjoyable experience well worth the price. 12 bucks gets you the best glass they have to offer filled with ice cold water and immaculately cleaned. staff were helpful, music, shows etc. only thing is it does get a bit smokey inside which for me i actually enjoyed. i left there super baked and completely satisfied. *two thumbs up.*

**Hotbox cafe**. went down to kensington market to check out one of their open mike/ comedy jams. the price was right. 5 bucks included the show and vape bag rentals. comedy was mediocre but got exponentially better the more i smoked. now thinking about it they had some pretty talented comics working that room. the vaporizer isn't as good imho as a volcano but it was fun and it did the trick. their bongs aren't as classy but they loan them out for free which is nice. down side is the small cramped space. the sketchiness of the clientele and surrounding area (we knew we were close when i started hearing people yell ""KUSH. I GOT KUSH.)Unfortunately I really don't see this place sticking around for very long because of the dealing issue as well as people smoking cigarettes inside. it is not without its charm though. not for me but definitely check it out if your brave and into trying something new. *one thumb up*


**vape on the lake**. ripoff central. 5 dollars at the door. 5 dollar vape bag rental. super expensive bong rentals. and unfortunately if you wanna go out get some fresh air or sun for more than 5 minutes they make you re-rent the bong and vape bag. staff is lazy/ unhelpful


**Village Vapor Lounge**- Walking distance to vapor central in the heart of wellsley village is village vapor lounge. The staff is friendly the location is clean. This place wasn't too sketchy and seemed to have taken the right measures to keep this place secure. they are strict on no tobacco/ no blunts which i like. Entrance fee is 5 bucks and that covers the full day. bong rentals are reasonable going from 5 to 12 dollars

I have been seeing multiple people each day come to this sub and ask the same questions

**Q: Dude

*A*: It all depends on which vaporizer you get

**Q: I don't feel high when I'm vaping. THIS SHIT SUCKS**

A: It is very likely that you are not inhaling properly or you do not have the temperature set right. Also, if that's the kind of high you like. 

**Q: My local headshop sells a cheap knock off of X vape for $50. Should I get it?!**

A: No. Just save your money and buy a real vape like the Silver Surfer. I personally wouldn't even mess around with the box vapes. The vapes like the Easy Vape actually have a plastic outside that get warped and melted from the heat which is very poor design if you ask me.

**Q: BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE!!**

A: Yeah

**Q: What the hell is AVB/ABV?**

A: AVB means ""Already Vaped Bud"" and ""ABV"" means ""Already been vaped"". They mean the same thing

**Q: I can cook that shit?**

A: Yes. You can use it to make edibles. You can also just throw it on top of some yogurt or something and eat it that way. It will still get you high since the THC has already been heated and therefore activated. Take note that you are of course eating the bud that most of the THC has been vaped off of already so it might take you a gram or two of AVB to feel anything.


**Q: Okay

*A*: Most people will immediately tell you that the Volcano is the best vape hands-down. 

I disagree. The only reason you should buy a Volcano is if you really want a bag vape. The volcano is built like a tank and will always work and give you consistent vapor. I, doesn't work too well, and is just a meh vaporizer with an incredibly high price tag.

**Q: So what do I get if I'm not really interested in a bag vape?**

*A:* A Silver Surfer, and they deliver strong, powerful, delicious, knock-you-on-your ass vapors every single time. I prefer the Silver Surfer but the Da Buddha is good for people on a budget, since it is essentially the same thing. If you get a bong to filter the vapor through from either of these, you have just about the purest

**Q: What about the Magic Flight Launch Box (MFLB)? Isn't that the best vape ever?!?**

A: I have had two Magic Flight Launch Boxes and I do not like them. They get the job done, and the 'lifetime warranty' is evidence of that. The MFLB is made with cheap materials and is very picky about how it vaporizes, and combusts very easily.

If you are on the go all of the and really like how it looks and don't plan to vape much, I have had nothing but poor experiences with them. the CS rep took weeks to get back to me and was kind of snobbish to me too.

**Q: Okay

A: The PAX is a good vape but uses up lots of material fast, Da Vinci is coming out with a new vape called the Descent very soon. I would wait until reviews are out, but it looks promising.

The Arizer Solo is also a very solid vaporizer but it is bigger and not too stealthy.

**Q: But this guy on /r/trees told me the Extreme Q was the best vape ever because it does BAGS and a whip!!!**

A: The Extreme Q is a great vape but it is very fragile. The 'metal' outside part is actually not real and feels very cheap. The bags are kind of 'cheesy' and do not work well

As curious as I am though, is that a lot of people talk about the thick clouds. 


Then there are also comments that are similar to what I will make up here: ""My MFLB only gets me to a [3] and the DBV/EQ can get me to an [8]"".


A quotation from the magic-flight site, by definition any device that produces visible vapor on exhale is categorically less efficient than one that does not. As such then, the ideal vapor density is exactly that which can be adsorbed by the lungs in a natural/comfortable interval of time -- usually between 3 to 5 seconds.""


So right now my interpretation is that ""thick clouds"" aren't better. Most likely they'll be much denser and there will be more vapor on exhale


In all my confusion


TL;DR:

- If I pack ~0.15g in a MFLB and the same amount in a DBV

- Why are thick clouds more prefered? Vaping doesn't take much time (imo)

- How can some users only get to a [3] with device X and to an [8] with device Y? When both devices get your load evenly cooked? Does this also mean that the [3] device will be left with more potent AVB than the [8] device? 

It just all seems so confusing :'(. I wish I knew someone with a desktop vape

I've been a casual smoker for years (usually once a day), but it seems like a high quality product, so what the hell?

Anyways

- How fully should I pack the oven? I've read that you should pack it fairly tight, so I'll be a little bummed if I have to load it all the way every time. 

- How long should a session last

- I ordered from vapeworld and they sent me a cheap little plastic grinder as a gift. Is this grinder sufficient

- How should I go about my first session? I think I saw someone recommend turning it on and letting it sit for 5 minutes before smoking

- If I average one session a day

- What should I do with the leftover herb after vaporizing? I get that you can use it for edible purposes

- Any other tips/tricks/recommendations?

when i first got the original vaporblunt, i'm impressed. it takes the stellar function of the original and squishes it down to nearly half the length.

the 2.0 has 5 heat settings as opposed to 2 settings on the original. it comes with an oil attachment ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/BVlit.jpg)) so anyone looking to vaporize oil, you will burn it. i have yet to try it with oil but i will be within the next week. 

the tokes are ridiculous on this thing though. i usually put the temperature to the 3rd setting and start to toke it as the 2nd heat level is ready. you wont get tokes like that off your mflb. imo it holds its own against a volcano bag. i was coughing like crazy the first time i tried it. the bowl packs about .5g which is less than the original but i found packing it down really tight allows for a longer session. a bigger bowl would be my only improvement request.

the battery on it lasts a good 2 hours

it is a fairly solid unit, but only because i wasn't anticipating using it (not a fan of mint)

all in all it is a very good portable vape. i know it is a bit pricey, and a pen vape and you truly get what you pay for. better vape by far.

1349421082.0,10ze98,Choosing between the PAX and the MFLB.,sriyegna,19,1,33,"So

Basically, and I'm stepping it up to a vape. What I look for is convenience, and comfort over all other things. Keep in mind that I am a first time vaper and I have absolutely no experience with one. Also, I live in a suite with 2 other guys, who don't smoke, but are fine with me smoking. They don't care if I do it in the suite, but I'd prefer not to be a dick

So

What are some pros/cons of both devices?
Does pushing in the battery on the MFLB hurt your hand?
Does the PAX heat up to a point where it's uncomfortable to hold?
Does replacing screens / maintenance cost a lot on either device?
Which one produces better vapor?
Which one is easier to use?
Do either products cover physical damage in their warranty?
Which product smells more?
Can I burn the weed easily with the MFLB? (I mean burn
How hard is it to learn to use the MFLB? Such that I can hold the battery in for the correct time.
Is the 30 second wait for the PAX in between hits? or for the entire chamber?
Which one smells more?

Also
And please tell me if you've had any bad experiences with either companies!

I'm leaning towards the pax... because it looks REALLY nice

1344707152.0,y202c,So I got a PAX Vape [review/comparison to MFLB],LegITsn1p3r420,20,3,22,"PAX from Ploom is a great vape

For starters the thing is really beautiful, however when you have it in the palm of your hand it just feels cool. Like you are vapeing in a Ridley Scott sci-fi epic. I know some people prefer the MFLB's rustic charms, and thats fine, this is a mostly subjective situation. Although I do think that the PAX looks less like a smoking utility, and because of that I would say it wins the discretion section of the aesthetic test.

Operating it is a breeze, pop off to control the temperature, is just cool! It feels slick and futuristic and its fun, this might sound stupid but I really enjoy the way it works haha. Once you turn it on the device takes 30 seconds to warm up, this was my main sticking point with the PAX, I was worried that the 30 seconds would seem like an ENTernity compared to the MFLB. It does feel like a wait, thats true, holding in the battery

Once its warm the thing works great, but I don't think it is quiet as powerful. At the highest there is a bit of combustion/cloud, but it definitely hits harder and faster. I prefer the precise temperature controls of the PAX to the MFLB as I dont have to ""train"" people how to properly use the PAX and get the best draw, like I do with the MFLB. The end does get pretty warm, I would compare it to the bottom of a really hot MacBook (~40C), so it can be annoying, but once I felt the effects of my herb I honestly enjoyed how warm it was in my hands. However if you think thats too hot dont worry, so you can hold it comfortably with the upper 2/3rds.

Battery life, I have used it for a good amount of time (2-3 sesh's), which consisted of about 3 loads worth, before the battery ran down. The big thing is that once you get going you can put it down and forget about it, it switches to low power mode and eventually turns off but I think that does burn some battery. It is better than the alternative of it just running itself into the ground, if you are into a really long sesh you could just bring out the charger and rest the PAX in it when it isn't in use, thus charging the battery. I have a feeling that the battery life will suit most vapers as they are not usually that far from electricity for *that* long. However

Warranty is another thing that people have brought up, I mean 10 years from now who knows what kind of cool new vapes or technology will exist? Getting a decade out of a product is fine for me, but if you think you are going to get 20+ years of use out of your MFLB and you need warranty to cover it for THAT long, then I guess the PAX isn't for you.

Cleaning is pretty easy

I really like the PAX and because it is so small

If you guys have any specific questions about it that I didn't cover here feel free to ask!

**tl;dr**

I like the PAX, and precise control of the PAX make it a superior product.

pros:
sleek and cool
heats up fast and works great

cons:
lower third of the device gets warm during operation
its a little slippery because its made of metal

**Comparison to MFLB**

Aesthetics: PAX (although this is subjective)

Discretion: PAX (The MFLB LOOKS like a smoking implement

Ease of Use: PAX (no learning curve

Battery Life: MFLB (only an issue on LONG trips with out power)

Warranty: MFLB (PAX offers 10 years

Chamber Size: Tie (The MFLB trench might be larger

Cleaning: PAX (dont have to worry about breaking the delicate screen like with the MFLB)

Effect: PAX (Again this is subjective

Cost: MFLB 

**Tally**

MFLB: 3.5

PAX: 5 **(winner)**

This weekend I made my first edibles (edible


I made one firecracker using a graham cookie and Nutella with exactly half a tablespoon of abv (so 7.5 ml). My abv comes from an Arizer EQ and I vape around 205°C


11:05 am: ate 1 quarter. Had not eaten anything else yet that day.


11:35 am: filled a bowl and vaped a few good hits


approx 13:30: I figure I'm about half-way through the movie and the mellow high hasn't grown stronger


15:00: movie's over and girlfriend wants to do some quick shopping for end-of-season winter boots sales


15:30: I eat my first actual food of the day because by then I am getting hungry.


17:00: back at home after shopping
I vaped for the rest of the evening and that's it.


So overall, next weekend I will eat both pieces at once and see if it gives me a different result. Any questions, comments, suggestions, tips, whatever, don't hesitate!!


Question for you guys: do you think the fact that I had not ingested food at all that day before taking the edible would have an impact on my experience? What is considered best practice in terms of food to maximise your edibles potency?

After saving some money and doing some research

Unfortunately, I had purchased the Da Vinci only days before moving to a new city for work. Knowing how difficult it would be for me to return this product to the vendor, I emailed Da Vinci directly to explain the situation and express my dissatisfaction with the product quality, as mine appeared to be a dud.

Within a couple of hours, they chose to go out of their way to coordinate internationally (I'm in Canada) with their distributor here who actually called me to apologize, and offer a replacement device from a shop in my new city! They really went out of their way to make sure I got a working device at no extra cost to me. I picked up [my replacement](http://i.imgur.com/29hWpqr.jpg) and it has been working great!

Vape technology is progressing rapidly, MFLB, or the NO2 that people swear by, one of the most important factors for folks like me that are on a budget, is assurance.

Hey guys.

You want a motherfucking [10]?  Or more bang for your buck?

Before you cap your AVB

I mean this politely, and your gut.  

Some of you may have noted stomach issues - this can be from larger leaf product that can irritate some intestinal tracts

Grinding your AVB to a powder means you get the most surface area for your intestines to absorb THC/CBD/CBN/etc from.  It also means you get much more in a capsule meaning a higher dosage

And think of it

The finer you can get it

I thought ""meh

we made weed oil, and we had **4 brownies each**. 

We ate two each to begin with

After about an hour it started to kick in. I turn to my mate and say ""can you feel it yet?"" He says ""Not really, like pulling your limbs through toffee.

We all thought this was hilarious and after a while we adjusted to it, whilst I refrained from doing so.

Needless to say we get higher and higher until it was **literally sickening to be alive**. I felt horrible, I was hungry but the thought of food was sickening and I couldn't move to make it.

Also after hitting the **Ploom Pax** let the vape cool down right side up (mouthpiece facing up) so the resin does not stuck to the mouthpiece and it wont get stuck in your unit.  
--Thanks to MadDogTannen for this one!


For the **Arizer Extreme Q** you can take rips directly from the elbow piece. If you pack herb tightly in the screen and turn the temperature up a bit more than you would typically start off at (I stick around 215 degrees centigrade) you will get gb quality rips but its vapor so its sick!

Also with the **Arizer Extreme Q** using the whip seems to get you higher quicker and cooks the herb more evenly than when using bags. I personally like to start off with the whip and transfer to bags to finish off the session. The herb still has good color and I'll hit my first bag, and the bags are full of thick vapor.

I settled on the Pax for a number of reasons

* Aesthetic design
* Portability
* Decent reviews
* Didn't want an MFLB

I had never vaped before and so I'm still struggling a bit with the learning curve. More on that in a bit.

The Pax is attractively packaged and presented. The unit itself has a nice heft to it and feels well made. 

The charging base is less sturdy than expected made but is functional.

After charging it I opted to run it for 5 minutes dry as suggested on another web forum. Then I ground up some Himalayan Gold and gave her a whirl.

The device heats up pretty quickly and the operation is slick. Simply click out the mouth piece and she heats up and the light turns green when you are ready to go. The draw is pretty strong - you have to use some lung power.

The unit also does get quite hot I must say but to be honest

I find it *very* difficult to know how much I'm taking in as you can't always easily see the vapor (being in a cooler room or outside helps a lot though) so I'm finding this adjustment quite difficult to make.

I certainly notice hits but it can be a bit difficult to judge just how much you are taking in. The taste is great and it feels way cleaner. The other night I put some hash in my pipe with a bit of regular cannabis and I was coughing up a lung!

I collected a bit of AVB and one night I decided to put this in a milkshake - holy cow. I was zonked out after 2 hours

I clean mine every 2 sessions or so - **don't waste your money with a Pax cleaning set!** it's just pipecleaners and some iso wipes at a ridiculous markup! I thought it might have been something more at the time haha.

I find the vaping high quite different and how it comes up is quite sudden. I think ultimately I will continue to combust as the highs are different - certainly with Sativa strains a joint or two hits on a pipe then being creative seems better than the vape but we shall see.

**Tl;DR** 

* Solid construction and performance. 
* Gets a bit hot
* AVB is amazing in milkshakes!
* Charge holds well
* No issues so far but I am trying to keep it clean

1356178624.0,15a0kz,got my inh004 yesterday. here are some thoughts.,criskyFTW,20,6,21,"ok. so I love the device

**pros**

&gt; easy to pack the herb capsules. just scoop some plant material in

&gt; heat temperature adjust is easy to use.

&gt; can get veryyyyyyyyy thick vapour clouds (if you're into that)

&gt;herb tastes very pure.

&gt; high seems to set in faster than other vapes i've used.

&gt;cap is smell proof.

&gt;great battery life

**cons**

&gt; herb capsules are very fragile

&gt; with the cap off

&gt; cap is a bitch to take off.

&gt; a little big

&gt;not very discreet at all. even on the lowest setting


**Compared to MFLB**

size: about 3 times as long 

smell: inh004 is much smellier 

""kick"": inh004 hits a lot harder

loading/unloading ease: MFLB is easier to load/unload 

ease of use: inh004 is much easier to actually hit. 

easier to clean: inh004 doesn't really require a lot of cleaning due to capsule design.

bottom line: MFLB is better for in a dorm room or when you want a slower buzz.

**compared to puffit**

size: inh004 is about twice a long. 

smell: inh004 is smellier. 

""kick"": inh004 hits faster

loading/unloading ease: about the same. 

ease of use: about the same. 

easier to clean: inh004 requires very little cleaning

bottom line: puffit is much better for discretion and use in public places.

**conclusive opinion on INH004** a great vape for chilling with friends or when you want to really taste the herb. it's an amazing device, so be careful when using it.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,penguin,

**TL;DR** looking for a sleek portavape that i could explain away easily if i am caught with it.

**edit** ok! i ended up going with the ambassador kit. i placed the order earlier today and it is being shipped out tuesday, the mflb in particular.

the reason i chose this was mainly for the reason that you essentially get 2 really crisp looking, which means that you can use them while they are charging, so that's a great option too.

I have been using e cigs for ~ 2 months now and I think they would be ideal for pot but I cant find any consistent/up to date info on how to do it. I have seen various mentions of dry herb attachments

Ideally I would like to make a PG/VG mix that I can use with my pen as needed. From what I understand you can achieve this by heating unflavored glycerin in a crude double boiler so I'd like to try that if possible. I've seen various (conflicting) info about how to do this and I'd love it if someone in the know could point me in the right direction. 

Specifically I was wondering:

Does using PG/VG make a difference? I prefer a 50/50 mix - is that fine to make a thc e e juice?

What voltage/ohm combo is needed?

How much bud would I need to use to make a tincture? The sidebar suggests an oz per 75 mg but I was hoping to use waaaaaay less (like 3 or 4 grams tops) and possibly make a smaller batch. I also live in California if that matters

I have heard it more insanely beautiful while on LSD and slightly less while on 25i but this was awesome in its own league of drug.

Edit: as promised

First, to the best of my ability, for those of you that don't have a fancy vape), so you can know what's coming into your lungs and what should be left in your AVB.  Finally, we'll go over a few strains so you can apply what you know and select strains to maximize your chosen effects.

* THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol): you guys know what this one is.  THC gets you high.  It's the most prevalent cannabinoid found in the majority of strains, and you shouldn't have to work to get it in your system.
* CBD (Cannabidiol): CBD actually works against THC as far as getting you ""high"" goes, analgesic (pain reduction), and antiemetic (nausea reduction) properties.  It acts as a sedative, and it can also be used to aid sleep. CBD boils between ~320-360° F, so the amount left will depend directly on how hot and for how long you vaporize, but lighter colored, tan AVB should have most of the CBD left.  Strains with OG Kush genetics generally have relatively high CBD content, such as Luca Brasi (Bubba Kush x Corleone) or Sour Kush (Sour Diesel x OG Kush).
* CBN (Cannabinol): Fun fact: CBN was actually isolated in the lab before THC, and muscle spasms.  The boiling point of CBN is ~365° F, which means that you shouldn't be inhaling much of it through the vape until the bud is turning a dark tan or even brown.  Most strains are relatively low in CBN, but THC degrades into CBN during storage, so save your old dried up stuff (assuming you're storing it right) for when you've got muscle pain/headache and just want to take a nap.
* CBC (Cannabichromene) and THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin): These chemicals act as THC agonists (increasing the effects) and are found in small amounts in most strains, so you shouldn't be getting much of this through your vaporizer unless you're vaping all the way to black.  That being said, if you consume your AVB orally before a session, you should notice that you're getting quite a bit higher and that the high lasts for longer than if you're vaping by itself.  CBC also has some analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but it can cause constriction of the blood vessels.  THC is a vasodilator, so it's generally not a problem, but those of you with high blood pressure may choose to avoid consuming your AVB by itself.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1ey9m4/vaporizer_science/

1353288895.0,13fd48,how does the PAX compare to the Launch Box?,criskyFTW,17,3,4,"alrighty. I've heard a LOT about the PAX since it came out

I currently own an MFLB, some 2700 batteries, and a nice whip.

can someone compare the PAX to the MFLB (with the PA)?

here's what i'm specifically wondering:

1) trench size. Which is bigger? MFLB or PAX?

2) heat up time. with the PA

3) risk of buring the herb. with the mflb it's very easy to burn the herb a bit if you aren't paying attention... how about with the PAX?

4) smell: which is smellier when newly packed (no vaping yet).

5) stirring: do you have to stir the bud in the pax?

6) ease of maintenance/cleaning: the mflb is very easy

7) warrantee. what's the PAX's?

8) I know there are MFLB knockoffs available that work just as well.  Does the pax have any yet?

I'm sure I am not the first one to do this

Get extra screens if you are a first time user.  If you have the heat up too high you will scorch a little bit and this will dirty the screen fast.  I would say the only true con I could come up with about the DB is it seems like I go through a lot of screens (1 every 3-4 days I would guess).  Is this normal or am I just getting it too hot?  BTW

I had a few little pieces of herb ""pop"" and drop down inside the heating element.  Is there an easy way to clean this or is it even necessary?  I tried inverting the DB itself of course

Very nice quality all the way around.  They are expensive,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,t3_176c04

1344966981.0,y7p8g,Experiments with standard eGo style e-cigs and Honey oil. What has worked what has not worked,ebrake,14,3,7,"I just wanted to share some of my experiments for others that might be interested in discrete vaping with concentrates (BHO

In an effort to save my lungs from dammage I invested in a volcano, however I found myself wanting to medicate anywhere and the MFLB while awesome just isnt a good option for places like airports where your greens are easy to identify and explaining why you are shoving AA batteries into a wood box is hard to explain.

This led me to experimenting with honey oils.  The eGo style e-cigarette is so convenient I wanted that option for medicating. Things I have learned in the process:

1. You can make your own ""juice"" much easier than you think.  Buy nicotine free e-juice

2. Using empty e-cigarette cartridges/tanks with medicated juice does work, you cant spill it, stores for long periods of time, and it can be used anywhere and it looks/smells 100% like an e-cig.

3. A BHO specific cartomizer is on the market from gentlemansvapes.com that has no filler material so there is no waste.  This product is great

I solved the loading problem by putting the BHO in the freezer for a bit to harden it up. Then you can roll it in your fingers to make a small thin rope that can be dropped right inside the cart. Gotta move fast tho while its cool

I solved the hot burning problem by investing in a cheap cone cover for my eGo battery.  Its like a heat shield over the cart.  They make them for cosmetic reasons but they work great to prevent burns.

Solved the taste/no smoke problem by adding 6-10 drops of the medicated juice after loading the pure BHO.  Now it tastes like the juice (I like blueberry waffle flavor) and produces a nice vapor cloud just like a regular e-cig. 

I put about .5 gram of BHO in my cart with 10 drops of the juice on top. Im getting between 400-600 hits before it needs to be refilled. (Compared with 60-120 hits on the regular nicotine carts with medicated juice)

4.  Most important thing I learned... Batteries make all the difference in the world.  Standard eGo batteries have a set voltage, running at 4.8 on the honey oil cartridge it only takes me about 3 drags to get comfortable medicated. I got my Joye eGo Twist batteries from ivape.com for like $22 each, I like to keep two on hand at all times so there is a backup if I need it.

Overall the experiment has been a success thus far. I have used it in airports, family functions, and everywhere else in my day to day life without any questions from people around me.  If anything they want to ask about how the e-cig is working out as a cigarette replacement. 

Took me a few months of trial and error to reach this point so this is more of a summary. If anyone has questions feel free to ask away.

1344490735.0,xxcm4,Another reason vaping is awesome: different temperatures produce different effects.

Low temperature vaping, where your herb is fully browned, will produce more of a body-heavy 'couchlock' effect.

Of course, but you can vape an indica at low temperature to get a more sativa-like effect, since THC (relatively heavy in sativa strains) is a low-temperature-boiling cannabinoid.

You can take your herb all the way to chocolate brown if you want, and I can't fully explain the stages approaching combustion, but perhaps someone else with the required expertise can.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/xxcm4/another_reason_vaping_is_awesome_different/

I am finally seriously able to look into buying a vaporizer for all the usual reasons (can toke inside/very little smell, etc.) and I'm trying to find out which is better concerning how much goes in each (the oven capacity), the resulting highs from said oven size, and the smell from a usual session.

I really want the Pax, that could be a problem haha), and looks like less smell has the possibility of escaping (I still live with parents, and know it's possible to use a vape indoors - a friend brought his Vapir NO2 over one day while my parents were gone, and they didn't smell anything later on) - I'm worried that the MFLB has more area for both the ""raw bud"" smell and vapor to escape through both the trench and the mouthpiece, whereas the Pax just has the mouthpiece, since the oven is more securely ""covered"".

As of right now, I can save up a bit more from my next paycheck and buy less bud than what I was hoping. That said, I can buy a MFLB for $75 from eBay. :P

So basically, maybe less. Depends on how much ganja I have on hand).

Sorry for the long post. If you guys have answers concerning any of this

**Edit: Thank you all for your input. It seems MFLB will be my choice - I needed to save the money for a car anyways. I don't really plan on smoking out in public where it would look out of place.

Atmos Raw 

Iolite

Vapir Mini

VaporBlunt original

I could also call some other local head shops tomorrow and hope for/have them order a PAX or a MFLB vape. I've heard really great things about both of these. Basically what I'm looking for is: longevity, and a quality build. The money cap is $250,
