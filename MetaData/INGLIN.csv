Here is a plan myself and a friend in Her Majesty's Navy came up with to help bring a dose of much needed Hope and Glory to the Europeans

The first stages of the plan were concocted by our own /u/bogwood while he stood watch on the South Coast. 

1. Build a large ship canal through France [like this (credit to the aforementioned Sir)](http://i.imgur.com/1nMoZ1E.png), they have never been Civilised

2. We send our gunboats and troop transports up to Brussels through said canal

3. Intelligence reports that Johnny Native have formed a ""European Union"" which is based in Brussels

4. Gunboats open fire and Our Brave Redcoats get out, and promptly bring the required Hope and Glory to the area, with bagpipes, bugles and drums playing

5. With their new masters taken

6. We shall issue ""directives"" mandating all the Natives and Colonials to sing God Save the Queen everyday and drink at least 3 cups of tea a day

The legal age for the purchase of alcohol from an off-licence (store/supermarket) is 18. (The legal age to buy liqueur chocolates is 16, but this is rarely enforced.)

Supermarkets or off-licence chains that are found to have violated the law and have repeatedly sold alcohol to underage persons are then required to adopt the Challenge 25 scheme. Failing to adhere to this will result in revocation of the licence to sell alcohol. (Challenge 25 is standard procedure in Scotland and the main supermarket chains.)

""Lieutenant Terence Edward WATERS (463718) (deceased)

Lieutenant WATERS was captured subsequent to the Battle of the Imjin River

On the journey to Pyongyang with other captives

Subsequently, flooding a great deal of the floor in which were packed a great number of South Korean and European prisoners-of-war in rags, filthy, crawling with lice. In this cavern a number died daily from wounds, sickness or merely malnutrition : they fed on two small meals of boiled maize daily. Of medical attention there was none.

Lieutenant WATERS appreciated that few, in view of their weakness and the absolute lack of attention for their wounds. After a visit from a North Korean Political Officer, who attempted to persuade them to volunteer to join a prisoner-of-war group known as ""Peace Fighters"" (that is, active participants in the propaganda movement against their own side) with a promise of better food, of medical treatment and other amenities as a reward for such activity - an offer that was refused unanimously - he decided to order his men to pretend to accede to the offer in an effort to save their lives. This he did, giving the necessary instructions to the senior other rank with the party, Sergeant HOPER

Whilst realising that this act would save the lives of his party

Realising that they had failed to subvert an officer with the British party

He was a young, Sandhurst, yet he set an example of the highest gallantry.""",,False,self,t5_2v1ve,,http://www.reddit.com/r/INGLIN/comments/1f9yoj/introducing_my_late_grandmothers_cousin/

I say that we do not let them *think* about such silliness. I say that we invade first

The plan is simple

1. Go to the new tab in /r/Ameristralia
2. Click to go to the comments of the latest post.
3. Search for the first line of Jerusalem
4. If the line is there
5. Squash this rebellion before it begins and show these barbarians the patriotism that would see their downfall if they continue!

The lines are provided here:
&gt;And did those feet in ancient time  
Walk upon England's mountain green?  
And was the holy Lamb of God  
On England's pleasant pastures seen?  
And did the countenance divine  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here  
Among those dark satanic mills?  

&gt;Bring me my bow of burning gold!  
Bring me my arrows of desire!  
Bring me my spear! O clouds
Bring me my chariot of fire!  
I will not cease from mental fight
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem  
In England's green and pleasant land.

I know things have not been well between our new nation and your old one recently and I have a list of suggestions to improve relations.  Clearly we are all freedom loving peoples who speak English based languages like 'Murican, freedom does foster development and civilization, which y'all are all about.

Without further ado


=MORE OF THIS=

Red Dwarf, BBC Documentaries, using ""sweet"" in combo with ""tea"" and maybe put it in a can or a 22 oz. cup where it belongs, FREEDOM, dragons or griffons maybe, Game of Thrones actors for new episodes (mostly about Kaleesi)
