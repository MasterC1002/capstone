1361045848.0,18niy2,Guide - How to sleeve a PSU power cord.,Lutro0Customs,64,12,15,"**Taken from my original guide on OCN:**
http://www.overclock.net/t/871183/guide-how-to-sleeve-a-psu-power-cord

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




This guide is not by any means the definitive guide and/or the only way to go about sleeving your PSU cord

**!!! A word of warning, please take the proper safety precautions. !!!**

This is a two part guide. The first part I will show you how to sleeve your cable using an IEC Connector. In the second part I will show you how to sleeve your cable and keep the original plugs.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-Part 1 : IEC Connector Guide-**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part will be the guide on how to sleeve your PSU power cable using IEC connectors found many places

**You will need a few things to get your sleeving project done.**

*1. PSU Power Cord*

*2. Scissors*

*3. IEC Connectors*

*4. Sleeveing of your choice and heatshrink (preferably 3:1)*
Please note that the sleeving will need to be a little bigger than the diameter of the psu cord your are using

*5. Lighter/ Heat Source for heatshrink.*

*6. Electrical Tape/Masking*

*7. Optional exacto-knife*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lets get started.**



http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9962/dsc03316s.jpg
Here are my connectors
P-037 Rhodium-plated US Power Plug &amp;C-037 IEC Connector


You will notice that these will be very sturdy as they have screws clamping everything down in multiple places


http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/3001/dsc03318n.jpg
You will want to take them apart by the two securing screws


http://img814.imageshack.us/img814/9329/dsc03319g.jpg
And here is our victimâ¦erm I mean cord.


http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/1797/dsc03320jw.jpg
Simply cut the ends with a scissors.


http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/3751/dsc03321hi.jpg
Like so.


http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4104/dsc03323v.jpg
Now you will want to strip down the ends about an inch


http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/3577/dsc03324a.jpg
Now we will start the sleeving process. It is always best to tape the end you will be putting the sleeve on as it will catch on the wires. Remember to measure your sleeving with the fact that it might shrink some as the actual length will shrink due to the sleeving being expanded.


http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/167/dsc03325h.jpg
I used clean cut sleeving but the choice is endless


http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/9260/dsc03326d.jpg
See! No fray!

http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/3416/dsc03327rs.jpg

This isnât really a step


http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1914/dsc03328f.jpg
Go ahead and put the back of the plug on and a small amount of heatshrink


http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9704/dsc03329du.jpg
Cut up small pieces of heatshrink


http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/6180/dsc03330a.jpg
Shrink them on


http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/8500/dsc03331ye.jpg
At this point I made a diagram of where the wires went

Go ahead and put the wires in and make sure they are screwed tight!


http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/358/dsc03334mj.jpg
Shrink up the exposed area of color on the wires and your sleeving at the same time. Nice and clean!

Put it all together and this is where you get to notice those little details that cleaned up the plug

Here is another possible combo by lovesan.

And there you have it the final project


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-Part 2 : Keeping the OEM Connector-**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**You will need a few things to get your sleeving project done.**

*1. PSU Power Cord*

*2. Scissors*

*3. Soldering Iron &amp; Solder*

*4. Sleeveing of your choice and heatshrink (preferably 3:1)
Please note that the sleeving will need to be a little bigger than the diameter of the psu cord your are using

*5. Lighter/ Heat Source for heatshrink.*

*6. Electrical Tape*

*7. Optional exacto-knife*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lets get started.**




http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/2206/sleevi001.jpg
We will start with your standard PSU power cable.


http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/4232/sleevi002.jpg
Measure out the sleeving to the cord from one end (where the plug starts and the cord ends) to the other end and set the peice of sleeving aside.


Make the first cut about 5 inches up from the plug that goes into the wall.


Using your scissors in a circular motion very softly and carefully cut the outer layer


Make the second cut about 4 more inches down in the same fashion.


http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2854/sleevi003.jpg
Using either an exacto-knife or the tip of the scissors cut a slit down the outer layer of the cord until you can pull on it and split it down to your other cut.


http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/2737/sleevi004.jpg
Cut your wires in a staggering pattern.

Like so:

----/------------------

-------------------/---



http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7353/sleevi006.jpg
Take the piece of sleeving we measured out earlier and put it on the longer side of the cord and push it back until its about an inch out of the way and then tape it with the electrical tape so it doesn't move.


http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/281/sleevi007.jpg
Slide on your two pieces of heatshrink.


http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/8162/sleevi008.jpg
I prefer to shrink the opposite end just to have it done with


http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/7522/sleevi009.jpg
Twist your wires together making sure to put a piece of heatshrink on beforehand.


http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5228/sleevi010.jpg
Solder each wire. (if you are good at soldering you can tin the wires straight like a pro solderer


http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7986/sleevi011.jpg
Shrink the heatshrink and give the wire a slight twist to bunch them together like so.


http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/7458/sleevi012.jpg
While they are twisted tape it tightly with electrical tape or heatshrink


http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1615/sleevi013.jpg
Pull the electrical tape off the sleeving and push it all the way to the end of the plug tightly (where the cord ends and the plug starts) and shrink the heatshrink.


http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9199/sleevi014.jpg
Enjoy your cord.


http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/9857/sleevi015.jpg
Pet works great as well but I would put a black sleeve underneath for a cleaner look.

http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8150/sleevi016.jpg


I hope this has helped those that were curious how this was done. I am sure there are many methods to get to the same goal. So if there is any suggestions please speak up and I will add them to the OP.


Thanks for your time.

The information and builds featured here have been superb and an behalf of all the mods at r/cablemanagement I say thank you!

Now to the contest:

The contest is for all the builders out there who strive for a clean build but their cases won't allow it. Basically

The rules are:

1.  The case must cost less than $40

2.  The case can not have any cable management holes on the motherboard tray or anywhere else.  If you drill the holes yourself that's ok but none from the manufacturer are allowed.

3. All builds must feature a video card with at least one PCIe connector.

4. Modular and non-modular PSUs are both accepted but builds with a non-modular will receive a 10% bonus in votes.

5. (Edit)  Please include a picture of the back panel in your submission.

Before I announce the prizes

Prizes:

1st place- Switch 810 SE Matte Black + Starter Kit

2nd Place â Starter Kit

3rd Place â Starter Kit

If you haven't seen this case yet, who cares?  They're all awesome!

You can submit your build on this thread throughout the entire month of July.  At the end of the month the voting will take place and the winners will be decided!  When submitting your build

If you have any questions about the contest please don't post them in this thread; they will be deleted. Instead

Good luck to all who enter and thanks again to NZXT to making this all possible. Have a great July!

Rationale:

* CPU - No Microcenters near me, meh. Primarily for gaming so didn't need Hyper Threading on the i7.
* CPU Cooler - Wanted to go air, looks great with no loss of performance.
* Motherboard - I really liked the features (Built in wifi + bluetooth!), no big.
* Memory - 8 gigs of memory for gaming. Black. Low profile to fit under the engine block. Done.
* Storage: Had a 2TB media drive
* Video Card: Had good luck with XFX in the past, but were 4 eggs when I got them). Not sure if Newegg got a bad batch or cards are crappy. Guess I'll find out and see if XFX is still all about it's lifetime warranty. Myself - I've had no issues, love these things.
* Case - Fractal R4. I love minimal
* Power Supply - Went with a gold standard brand. Got some individually sleeved cables from ModDIY.com instead of doing it myself. because the stock ones are ugly as hell and because in the equation of my life time &gt; money. Wanted customs because with extensions you still have the mess coming out of the power supply
* OS: Windows 8 + Startisback. Glory.
* Monitor: Monoprice 30"" IPS. I originally got a 24"" 1080p 120hz monitor. I realized that 120hz meant nothing to me. Returned it
* Keyboard: Cooler Master Storm Quickfire Rapid, clean.
* Other: Bose speakers my dad no longer wanted, and HP Laserjet 1200 printer. The best fucking printer this world has or will ever see.

Hope you enjoyed my build.

Built this Three Hundred for a client today. Seems to have turned out alright. Antec recently revised the 300 a bit. They ditched the Molex connectors for the fans in favor of the 3-pin style for motherboard fan headers. Also, instead of a bunch of twisted pairs, and they also ditched the little AC97 extension to the front HDA cable. I've been cutting that stupid thing off for years. Seriously, when was the last time ANYONE manufactured a board with AC97? Shit, I think the last time I used that was on an AMD K6. 

Anyways

The CPU 12V was routed along the far left side and down

For the sake of brevity I didn't cut holes in the chassis for the 24 pin like I do in some of my 300 builds (like my featured one on the right

**Edit:** I've worked on it a bit! [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ra17cX0.jpg) is what it looks like so far. I don't quite know the exact length I need for the power and reset switch cables and USB and audio and whatnot, again probably the default ones that come with the H110 unfortunately). That main bundle of cables has some squaring up needed, but again I need their exact length. The one drooping down into the motherboard tray is going to be held up with a tab of hot glue to hold it reasonably taught, as with perhaps the ones on the left, the fan connector in the way of where the right latch goes, and the molex to keep it out of that little ""window."" Nothing crazy, just a small dab to hold it in place. That seems like the way to go. I can't wait to get the motherboard so I know how long those cables need to be!   

All the slack is in that 5.25"" drive bay area

Again, on a difficult AX series no less).   

All extra fan controller cables are under the hard drive cage (in the plastic thing) but I may remove that completely

**Top Submissions:**

- [HONEST_ABE_APPROVES](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cbbaxpd): I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful cable this user drew up in MS Paint: http://i.imgur.com/r6b2kDs.png . This was the only submission as well that had the front side color scheme different from the back

- [SausageLegs](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb84ung): This was such a beautifully done haiku

- [culexor](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb8965l): Awesome looking rig. Great job on the cablemanagement!

**Honorable Mentions:**

- [okp11](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb88pdj): LOL

- [Scooternuts](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb86vf4) - Love how you incorporated that Asrock brown in there : P

- [lonewolf727](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb8abd7) - Love the TMNT theme. My only gripe is that you modeled it after Michelangelo and not Raphael : (

- [schmintendo](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cbae83u) - Your haiku gave me a good chuckle. Any chance you can show me some pics of your cable management?

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a spot for Left 4 Dead 2 for the giveaway. A member on the irc channel at /r/buildapc has since claimed this.

For some reason, and I'll gift it to whomever at random.

Anyways

P.S. In the next week or so I'd like to sleeve the ideas for color schemes posted to the contest. I'll be posting pictures when they're done so stay tuned!

The PC isn't anything special spec-wise. It was put together out of mostly used/displaced parts around our office, Photoshop, and a few other programs, so it didn't have to be a beast. 

 
Cabling took a while. The Antec Three Hundred doesn't have any built in cable management options, get over it. The SATA cables were cut to length and soldered for the hard drives. The CPU fan cable and the remote cables for front USB and power/reset/LED headers were cut to length and shrouded. All of the fans are soldered together so that there is only one Molex connection for them.

In my mind it's not that bad but when seeing other builds mine looks terrible. Please don't be mean

Here is a link to pictures of my setup: http://imgur.com/a/ldekg

When I built this come 2 1/2 to 3 years ago I didn't know anything about cable management. Now I feel like an idiot for having my PC like this. Any information would be helpful!
PS: If anyone has suggestions for build/setup I am willing to learn and make it better
Also any tips on external cable management would be great to! I bought some cable clips from Zellers for $0.50 that I should be using.
One more thing I forgot is I have a GTX680 (link below) is it worth it to install it into this computer? or should I just put it into my media PC (running 2 GTS450's). I think graphics isnt the limiting factor and would only be used as another heat source.

First let's get the materials out of the way. I used paracord from [theparacordstore.co.uk](http://www.theparacordstore.co.uk). 

I got heatshrink

To get the pins out of the connectors

Thoughts one the whole thing? It was fun, and that's not a very nice feeling to have when you can't just replace the cable, but actually have to get a new PSU if you mess something up. I'm just happy it turned out as nice as it did. 

The heatshrink itself doesn't look quite as nice as I would have liked it to

[Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/gs18G)

[Manual PDF](https://www.wesena.co.uk/downloads/manuals/wesena_ITX2_manual.pdf)

With the ODD tray in place there will be a tiny bit  of room on top to route cables and they have included spaces to bring the cables though. The problem is that the cables themselves are short and in the case of the SATA cables stiff and difficult to work with. 

I will be looking for some round cables to replace the OEM SATA cables that came with the motherboard

I can already tell heat will be an issue so I am looking to add a 2nd 40mm fan to the front right vent as an intake but with the cable mess as it that will be mostly ineffective. So I am hoping to route as many to the top of the ODD tray as possible.

Unfortunately it is not a very common case and there is very little info online as far as previous builds go.

Thanks!

PS. Ill try to get better pictures

**Update:** I've taken the tips into action but i still have lots of work to do. Im thinking about sleeving the cables? Just the simple ones, white weird cables). Whats the easiest way to do so? I know this is sort of ""ghetto"" but can i just wrap like the 4 inches of the visible cable in electrical tape? Im not talking about the whole cable, but rather just the visible part.

So after re-doing my cables five or so times here is the final result. Overall I am very happy and looking into getting some custom sleeving to top it off. I also am kinda proud of my little mod for the side panel connector I did. It's nothing special but it really helps keep everything looking clean and makes its easier to remove/replace the side panel.

Anyways, and I will get one, but I want to take care of my cables first, because I'm almost certain they're blocking airflow. So, any ideas, anyone? Don't be shy.

**A little feedback**
I've had the same tiny budget case for years now and I've come to a point where the case is so filled up with cables ( no room for cable management ) that the case won't close properly.
I'll refrain from posting pictures as I am sure it would churn your stomach.
So I need a new case!

* My current case is very noisy, all the time.
Which is what caused my interest towards the Fractal Design case

* My cable management is so bad I assume this subreddit would shun it more then the Chinese currently shun the Japanese.
But I can't help it

I know this subreddit adores the 600T and I suppose it's for good reason ( did some research but nothing to convincing so far ) but it's hard to get in my country

I would really love to take my first shot at cable management with this rig so she can have something nice to show off

About how much would it cost for cable extenders and necessary accessories to hook all that up and make it look absolutely clean while taking up as little space as possible (gonna be overclocking what I can within reason so any air restrictions saved are nice too).

She will eventually be adding more hard drives as she settles into it. She has plenty of externals

Its done. My baby is built and Ive been in love ever since. Seeing that this is my very first build I opted take it a step further. I decided to get my own para cord and began a painful journey to (burn the hell out of my fingers) sleeve my own cables. Guys a few of the pin slots were difficult to remove the pins and I ended up ruining the stops in the slot that catch the metal prongs on the pin which hold the pin in place. I put a dab of crazy glue right where the sleeving ends just under the actual pin (being carful to not get any on the actual pin itself) to rectify this. Does anyone object to this method? I would rather not have to buy more cables to sleeve
