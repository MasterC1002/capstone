Once a multi-platform browser like Firefox can play it that'll allow Linux users to more easily get this up and running.

What I'm looking for:

* Silent
* Inexpensive (under $150)
* Supports IR remote control (via USB dongle is fine)
* Supports power on/off via remote control (or draws so little power that it doesn't matter)
* Smooth playback of all mainstream codecs (xvid and AVC, with AC3 and DTS decoding, not just passthrough)
* Smooth menus
* Able to boot directly to XBMC (or OpenElec)

I guess, but cheap and silent.

Or should I stop waiting and just build a silent PC?

...

UPDATE: So I just ordered an Ouya from Amazon. Here's my understanding and reasoning: It's got the power to make pretty skins operate smoothly and decode SD (XviD for example) content smoothly also. While there is no official version of XBMC for it with HW acceleration yet, although might be tricky. All in all, it looks like a pretty decent horse to hitch my wagon to. And FREE GAMES! THE FUTURE!

UPDATE: well i found out the hard way that the Ouya isn't silent, so i'm gonna try that now! still NOT regretting my decision. XBMC plays all files and menus smoothly, however it does crash often. i expect those bugs to get squashed over the coming months.",,False,,t5_2qhno,,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1jco5j/are_we_there_yet_looking_for_a_small_silent_cheap/

Recently we have added support for multiple servers

Another small change (that I feel is actually pretty useful) is the ability to choose from a 3, which means that you can display a lot more modules on the screen.

We have quite an active dev community. Gugahoi has created a fully-functional module to manage Sickbeard

Other features include a media library browser and advanced playback/seek controls. You can even toggle ""remote"" mode and use your keyboard to control XBMC!

1372783284.0,1hi7yc,How to: Use the XBMC Backup addon with Dropbox,TehEmperorOfLulz,22,3,5,"Hi there! If you've ever tried messing something up with your XBMC installation

**Step 1:** Install the addon. It can be found in offical XBMC repository

**Step 2:** Create a dropbox app! Head on over to [dropbox.com/developers/apps](http://dropbox.com/developers/apps), so maybe you'll have to try a couple of times. Just give it permission to a single folder, and proceed. On the next page, don't go anywhere but take note of the *App key* and *Secret key*. We will need those now!

**Step 3:** Authenticating your app with XBMC Backup. (I'm assuming you're running Confluence or a skin that has the same menu structure)

You'll want to go into the programs folder, simply right click! You'll want to bring up the settings menu for the addon. With a mouse I suppose you'd right-click, but what you want is not the menu with the options *Backup* and *Restore*, but a 4-point menu with one point being *Add-on settings*

In the General tab, and simply click **OK**

**Step 4** Authentication, you need to either SSH or SFTP into your XBMC if you're running without any peripherals, or else, open up a file explorer. I'm running Linux, (RASPBMC), but the instructions are almost the same. For **RASPBMC or another dedicated XBMC OS**, navigate to:

/home/%USERNAME%/.xbmc/temp/xbmc.log

&amp;nbsp;

For **Windows XP**

%MainDrive%:/Documents and Settings/%Username%/Application Data/XBMC/xbmc.log

&amp;nbsp;

For **Windows Vista

%MainDrive%:/Users/%Username%/AppData/Roaming/XBMC/xbmc.log

**Step 5** Finding your authentication URL: If you're SSH'ing in, you'll find a line somewhat like this:

**NOTICE: script.xbmcbackup: Authorize URL: https://www.dropbox.com/somethingsomething/**

Copy this URL into your browser

**Step 5.5** Authentication URL for SFTP or Standard file explorer: If you're using SFTP or FTP, also for standard file explorers, find the line mentioned above, and copy it into your browser. Allow the addon to use your app, and you're good to go!

The HTPC from Pulse Eight is good, and unable to confirm is the system is registering the right temprature or not, but the case itself, even though is built to behave as a heatsink gets seriously warm.
It plays all 1080p videos just fine, they could potentially be used as great xbmc htpcs.

Here's what I have and what I'm trying to do. So I have an external HD that I store movies and TV shows that I'm no longer streaming on. Almost everything there added fine. Where I'm having trouble is in trying to add my second HD, the newest season of 30 Rock just will not show up without going into the ""Files"" menu. I'm not sure if this is a scraper issue or a filing issue. On the external drive (where mostly everything works fine) the TV shows are organized into individual folders for each show. On the seeding drive everything is just kind of thrown in there and the only time its split into folders is when it downloaded that way, and even those shows in folders don't show up. On the drive I use for storage everything seams ok, with a few exceptions (like Batman Beyond only showing up as a show title but not showing any of the episodes). I read on the XBMC wiki that missing videos is usually due to a file name problem and I should rename them. First off, there's no way I'm going through and individually renaming 500 GBs of TV shows. Second, the file names are exactly the same on the storage drive (like 30.Rock.S07E01.SomethingaAbouttheUploader.mkv/mp4/whahtever). What am I screwing up here? 

Also, and I'm sure exists somewhere, is the ability to some how link to the private tracker I use and show new shows and movie uploads so I dont have to close XBMC and open a browser and then add files to uTorrent. If I'm going to do all that I might as well just use uTorrent to open the file. Any nice way of doing this?

1356891466.0,15oivq,Experiences setting up OPENELEC XBMC on Zotac ZBOX ID84,Newklol,17,4,3,"Hi guys

I just set up OPENELEC XBMC (latest stable version for ION) on my new ID84 and want to share my experiences with you.

The Hardware: The ID84 has no problem playing 1080p mkv files with full DTS sound without a stutter. It is a nice and small machine which comes with a remote

Getting the dedicated Nvidia grafics to work: Just make sure the VDPAU option in the system playback menu is checked.

The Sound through HDMI: For sound to work through HDMI you need to disable the sound for the onboard soundcard in the BIOS.

If you experience the 24p bug (aka stutter in all playback with all files): There is an option in the video playback settings in XBMC's system options which allows XBMC to adapt the frequency to the TV settings. This will make XBMC play all files in 24p and so the stutter is gone.

Building the library: It can be a lot of work to get your files in if you haven't named your files properly before. If you switch to the file view you can find easily which movies have not been found by scrolling through the list and looking out for movies which don't have a poster yet. These will need manual adjustments to work.
For TV series to be found properly I found the best is to have all files named something like S0XE0X in the filename.

Logitech Harmony: Setting up a Logitech Harmony to work with this setup is no problem. Just choose the ID80 remote setting in the Logitech configuration. It will work.


Overall it needed some tweaking here and there but I think it was worth it! I hope my little beginner tips might help some of you.",,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/15oivq/experiences_setting_up_openelec_xbmc_on_zotac/

Is there a way to scrape for these, OR, are there actually season/episode numbers you can look up somewhere to attach to these kinds of shows?

Also, which is labeled by disc rather than by season (for instance, ren_and_stimpy.disc01.e01.avi and so on).  Since it's more of a ""best of"" collection rather than pure seasons, they're labeled this way, and tvdb didn't scrape anything for it but the folder name and the artwork - no episodes listed when I follow into it through XBMC.

* I want to be able to use the web browser through XBMC
* And i would like to be able to stream video's from my pc/possibly a small media server.

* Should I use Raspbmc or OpenELEC ?
* I'm from Europe

I am merely doing a workaround that I will not have to change every 3 months when it gets patched. So what I am trying to do anyway is just remap certain keys on my remote to open the Hulu and Netflix apps using my Windows Media Center (RC6) Remote.  

I have already followed http://xbmccustomregis.sourceforge.net/index.html this guide and got it all setup and everything is great and dandy it got my ""Green Windows MC (Media Center) Button"" working to open XBMC instead of MC

I mean this is not a huge deal if I cannot resolve it

**Update** I do realize that I can read the documentation and learn how to script most likely fairly quickly

**Update** I guess Advanced Launcher is another option

**Yet another update** I have done a little more research and have come across some similar projects that take advantage of Hulu Desktop and what I assume is the Netflix addon in MC (did not do too much reading into the script as I am unfamiliar with the syntax ect). I will assume with a little modification I should be able to get this working. Something else I ran into was when I located the Windows 8 App installation folder I was unable to run the executable directly. So I made a little shortcut with some custom parameters and I was able to get Netflix working with no issues using: 

    C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start """" ""Netflix:""

 ;however

**Sadly this is not possible right now :(** Due to Hulu and Netflix not having even keyboard support at the current moment no matter what you do the remote will not work unless it has a mouse feature built in too; however

**I was wrong there is hope** Thanks to a response by Amdingo which you can read here http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/14httw/remapping_an_rc6_remote_for_use_in_hulu_netflix/c7fjakb I think that I might have a solution now.

I have tried to boot a couple different linux OS's (damn small linux, and Puppy linux) from a USB but nothing is working!!! Does anyone have any ideas? I have been googling all day and can't find an answer that works!! Help me reddit you're my only hope!

Specs:
Model: HP t5630w 
Microsoft Windows XPe Pro 5.1
Processor: VIA Eden 1000MHz 
Memory: 1GB RAM 
DirectX: 9.0c 2GB hard disk space. 
I am using an 8GB Flash Drive

If more info is needed please let me know! Thanks!!!!

1. when i connect my wired cat5 (gigabit router) video playback is choppy as fuck.  Wireless works fine but drops a frame or two every once in a while.

2. I'm having trouble getting YATSE to work. I had it working when connected via wired but now that i had to switch back to wireless to be able to watch anything

Basically files play fine with VLC over SMB however when I try to play the same file on XBMC my frame rate goes to crap and even my mouse starts lagging making it unwatchable.  

I was having this problem earlier but I thought it was because my graphics card was DVI and it was related to some sort of audio issue since I was using a DVI -&gt; HDMI cable to connect to my TV.  I messed around with using a S/PDIF cable to connect my graphics card to my motherboard so I could send sound through DVI ([original thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1b4ljq/problems_playing_video_streaming_with_addons/)) but it didn't work so I ended up just ended up switching out my video card to one that supports HDMI out.  

I thought that would resolve it but I am still having the same issues as you can see in the video.  Any input is appreciated

I've uploaded a *very* rough mockup of some provisional ideas i've had which can be viewed [on imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mf2ro.jpg).

The idea of the app is to better bridge the gap between XBMC and bittorrent. I'm quite new to XBMC but after downloading the XBMC Commander app for iPad (highly recommended btw)

TorrentScrape is an app which scrapes bittorrent trackers (currently thepiratebay only), plot synopsis etc. categorising this data accordingly.

Compatible with the Transmission bittorrent client, they'll pop into your library as usual.

So

So far i'm thinking:

- Top Movies (today's top seeded movies)
- Top TV Shows (today's top seeded tv shows)
- Search (search for specific titles
- DL Manager (UI control for Transmission client
- Recommendations (not seen in mockup) - Using the tastekid api

I'm trying to find something that is powerful enough to play any hd downloaded videos from my external hdd, my router is on the first floor, and this box if going up stairs.  HDMI audio and video is a must.  Power consumption is a concern as well; I tried to use an old dell xps 400 that I had in the garage but it pulled too much power.  My house is old and 4 rooms share the same circuit.  After about 10 minutes I blew the fuse with the 400 plugged in.  So low power is a must.  Netflix support would be nice, but I have a ps3 and a laptop (that I currently use with xbmc, at a slight inconvenience sometimes) that do netflix just fine.  I would also like it to run on windows, not openelec or xbmcbuntu or any of the other linux, android etc options.  Its just a personal preference of mine. I mess with Linux as a hobby

I have looked at the raspberry Pi but I just don't know how fast or smooth it will run.  Especially when I try to play blu ray rips of anime series.  

I don't want an atv or atv2 because I have heard they are slow at times

I'm running XBMC under linux on an Acer Revo

A lot of the video files I play have an audio problem which I guess is to do with muxing the surround sound audio into two channels, and not necessarily in the way I'd expect. The dialogue is often very quiet so the volume needs to be increased, but moments of action will be deafeningly loud.

In a surround sound setup I'd compensate by turning up the centre channel, but I do get it on files with stereo audio - though I guess those could be false positives.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129054

A reviewer and XBMC user thought highly of it
s his review:

&gt; Pros: - Insides are very nice, and HDDs.
- LCD is nice and easily readable.
- Looks very sharp next to the rest of my stuff by the TV.
- The remote is excellent except for some minor points, with some minor XML file tweaking making it work perfectly.
- Close enough to silent that I've never heard the fans running

&gt; Cons: - Using a 2.5"" HDD (or SSD) is very awkward since the DVD drive bay goes right above it. I was using an IDE DVD drive and had a hard time getting both in the case and fastened down without accidently unplugging either one.
- If let the remote control the power on/off
- The analog stick thing on the remote is somewhat annoying

&gt; Other Thoughts: I bought it to use with XBMC live on Linux, the small icons around the edge of the LCD do not work with XBMC, but there is a perl script floating around that can work them. The only really show-stopper issue is the power-off/full-brightness LCD thing I mentioned, so if you can live with that or one of the workarounds (I believe not hooking the LCD remote power controlling cable up to the motherboard power cable fixes it but disables controlling power through the remote) then it's perfect!

When using XBMC Apptui allows you to swap between three different remotes depending on what you are looking to do.  You can navigate between a general navigation tab

In general Apptui changes as you interact with your computer providing you controls

We call it Apptui and you can download it here:

So if I'm a kid and I click on TV Shows on the main XBMC screen and the smart playlist brings back a list of shows that match the genres I've configured (ex: Age 8-12).  Then I sneakily go to search and search for something generic and it brings back a list of shows from the main library - including shows that are not in the playlist.  If I now select one of those shows it switches to that folder in the library and then if I go up a folder I'm able to see everything in the library...

1359647372.0,17mt74,Pivos Xios vs. Odroid U2,OkieNotRedneck,3,0,9,"I'm trying to decide whether to order a **[Pivos Xios](http://www.pivosgroup.com/xios.html)** or an **[Odroid U2](http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/main.php)** to serve as my XBMC host device. Here's what I know (or *think I know*) about them:

* Xios sells for **~~about $90~~** about $115; U2 for $89. **However** for many users
* Both have a 1.7ghz ARM Cortex-A9 cpu. Odroid says that theirs is quad core. Pivos doesn't say. Maybe all A9s are the same? Color me stupid for not knowing.
* Pivos has 3 USB 2.0 ports; Odroid has 2.
* Both have wired (10/100) and wireless networking. The wireless on the Xios is built in. On the Odroid
* Both have HDMI out. I can't find specs on whether their HDMI is 1.4 (first to support 3D video)
* Both have a Micro SD slot. Pivos says that theirs ""*supports up to 32gb*"" so it must be SDHC (which has a max of 32gb). It's unknown whether the Odroid supports SDXC (which, although nobody makes any bigger than 128gb currently), or only SDHC like the Pivos.
* The Odroid gives the option to use eMMC add-on memory which is considerably faster than Micro SD Class 10 memory. You can buy eMMC modules in 8gb, which are even faster than eMMC. Think of UHS 1 cards as being something like Class 30 or 40, if there were such a thing. However, there's no indication that either the Xios or the Odroid can use a UHS-1 Micro SD card anyway. 
* The Pivos people really tout that they were the first to have XBMC for Android and were intimately involved in its development. Blah, I'm not sure that this matters much, but YMMV.
* The Xios is ""*rootable*"". The Odroid comes rooted. 
* The Xios comes in a nifty looking case. The Odroid doesn't come with a case at all. It's just a little board mounted to a helluva aluminum heat sink. There are a variety of 3d party cases available for the Odroid for those of us nervous to have exposed electronics around kids.
* There are reports of the Xios getting hot enough to fry an egg

Ok

1) How soon are new TV shows added on? My GF and I watch Dexter, Homeland, etc... Is it possible to stream these shows live? If not, how long after they air are you able to watch them?

2) Should I be concerned about being able to watch all my sports teams? I'm a huge NBA &amp; NFL fan and I need to be able to watch my guys play on any given night! Have there ever been times when you tried watching a sports event but couldn't? Keep in mind, football, and soccer.

3) Would it be easy enough for my non-tech savvy girlfriend to figure out?

4) Any recommendations for a setup? Apple TV? Something else? If it helps, music, and also play movies/shows that I have saved to my computer (not sure if I still will with XBMC). If you could point me in the right direction that would be great!

1358201135.0,16krmd,Video file playback is 2-3 frames per second?,Sarthax,6,1,7,"I've had no problems with XBMC on my HTPC until a few days ago.  Out of nowhere all playback of 720p-1080p content is pretty much slow motion.  SD content seems to play fine.  If I play the content through WMP

Some video will playback for about 3-4 seconds with audio then slow down to a few frames per second.  Most just start like that.

I assumed it was buffering or something was eating up CPU cycles but that's not an issue.  All content is on local internal drives and CPU utilization never goes over 15% during playback.  Running Confluence skin with minimal addons.

Has anyone else seen this issue before and if so what was root cause and how to correct?
