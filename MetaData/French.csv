1369387251.0,1eyn4j,"""That's funny"" in French",AwesomeDewey,152,6,52,"J'avais ce petit projet qui me trottait derrière la tête depuis un moment:

Voici une bonne vingtaine de façons de traduire ""that's funny"" en français! Comme je ne connais pas exactement tous les équivalents anglais, natifs, n'hésitez pas à me corriger là où je me suis trompé!

----

c'est *drôle*: that's simply funny

c'est *rigolo*: that makes me laugh like a kid

c'est *marrant*: that makes me laugh

c'est *hilarant*: that makes me laugh even though I don't want to.

c'est *drôlatique*: that's something people would normally laugh to

c'est *risible*: that's laughable (ridicule

*ça me fait marrer* / je me *marre*: that's laughable (often ironic

*ça m'éclate*: I'm having a ton of fun

*j'ai la rate qui se dilate*: that's a great and healthy laugh (kind of old)

ça *fait mal aux zygomatiques*: I'm laughing so much it hurts

""*Très drôle.*"": ""Very funny."" (almost always ironic when used alone. ""Très marrant."" and ""Très rigolo."" used on their own are almost never ironic

je *ris jaune*: I pretend to laugh. That's not funny

ça me fait *rire nerveusement*: I'm laughing nervously

je *pouffe de rire*: I'm giggling

c'est *cocasse*: that's genuinely funny, 190cm high and spike collar busy choosing a cute kitten in an animal shop would be *cocasse*).

c'est *poilant*: that's extremely funny 

je *me poile* : I'm laughing uncontrollably

ça *me défrise*: ""that's so funny even my hair is straightening""

*c'est énorme!*: that's extraordinarily funny (can be genuine or sarcastic depending on context and tone

*j'adore!*: I love it

*très bon!*: objectively very funny!

*trop bon!*/*trop drôle!*/*trop marrant!*: too funny!

*t'as mangé un clown?* : I'm not laughing at your bad joke

*c'est une blague?* : is that a joke?

*je déconne*: I'm kidding (vulg)

je *me roule par terre de rire*: I'm rolling on the floor laughing (merci à /u/JohnnyMcCool) 

je suis *plié en deux*: I'm laughing so much my belly hurts

je suis *plié en quatre*: I'm laughing in foetal position

je suis *mort de rire*: I'm dying of laughing -&gt; ""mdr"" = ""lol"" (merci à /u/JohnnyMcCool)

je suis *pété de rire*: I'm laughing so much I'm breaking -&gt; ""ptdr"" = ""rofl""

---

/u/WongoTheSane nous suggère les expressions suivantes que j'intègre avec bonheur:

Il *rit aux éclats* : he roars with laughter

Il *éclate de rire* : he bursts into laughter

Il *rit sous cape* (cité par /u/CalvaireEtLutin [+3] ci-dessous) : he's snickering (merci à /u/Truthier pour la traduction)

Il *rit à gorge déployée* : he's laughing out really loud (this one is sometimes quoted as ""rire à gorge d'employé"" for comic effect)

*J'ai un fou-rire* : I'm having a fit of laughter

---

**Bonus**: on rencontre parfois en discutant sur le net ou les messageries les termes suivants: ils datent d'avant la démocratisation des smileys et autres MDR/PTDR. Notez que leur usage est tiré directement de la langue parlée

haha: lol

HA HA HA: LOL

héhé: :P or ;) depending on context

hihi: kiddie or girly giggle

hin hin: that's not really funny (see ""rire jaune"")

hu hu: a posh or forced laugh

ho ho: rire du Père Noël (Santa Claus laugh)

niark niark: Evil laugh, niark niark."" (merci à /u/CalvaireEtLutin)",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,1369407769.0,L1,

I am not doing this anymore

------------------------------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT EDIT:**

The server is now off

-------------------------------------------------------------

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Following [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/h4fjm/hey_rfrench_are_you_interested_in_an_oral_chat/), so I decided to set up a Mumble server. (No warranty in long term)

Mumble is a teamspeak like

The address of the mumble is kushou.tonbnc.fr on port 18000.

If you want to teach oral speaking in french, don't be shy and join us !

I am curently on it with a friend of mine

**EDIT:**

Ok so

*When is this open ?*

For now, in ""Need to practise"" otherwise. Everything said in any of those two channels is heard in the other, I have just made two channels to categorize people.

Now that this is told, but for now, I will do it with friends of mine, so I can't say there will always be a fluent speaker there.

*How can I connect to Mumble ?*

- Click ""Add a new server""
 * Name = what you want
 * Address = kushou.tonbnc.fr
 * Port = 18000
 * Username = what you want.
- Click OK
- Anwser yes to the security question when asked at first connection.

*I'm a beginner

YES

*How does it work ?*

My method will be as following:

- First
- Speak, until you are not afraid to speak.
- Then I will correct your mistakes to help you improve your French !

I find that when we say ""excuse me"" in English, or to warn people blocking the sidewalk that you have to squeeze by, when really you have every right to pass.

One level up for me would be to say ""sorry."" I might say ""sorry"" to a shopkeeper if I want to get his attention and he's in the middle of something in order to acknowledge that I'm disturbing him

The top level for me would be to say, ""I apologize."" To me, that means that I full on regret having wronged that person and that I would not have done what I did on purpose if I could have prevented it. It takes full responsibility for one's action as inexcusable. I might save this for if I accidentally ran into someone without seeing them and knocked them to the ground. For ""excuse me"" and ""sorry,"" I was signalling my intrusion as I was actually doing it, but for this one I am cleaning up after something that I genuinely regret.

WHY AN MMO? Simple: If we hold true to the French speaking cause while in game it would offer an unparalleled sense of immersion into a French speaking world, but from battle stories, loot requests, co-operative tasks, etc., offering a potentially more diverse/stimulating range of subject matter. And I can see a community based on an MMO, which is designed specifically to sustain interest, it would make learning French FUN (probably)!! 

BUT I DON'T LIKE MMOs: No problem. The MMO isn't the point. In fact, and shoot the shit with people. Conversations are often the only way to endure the monotonous parts of games like these anyway, and I'm sure anyone stuck on a fetch quest would be glad to have a conversational distraction. Think of the game as a supplement for the social component: THE POINT OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS NOT THE GAME ITSELF, BUT RATHER TO OFFER A CONSISTENT &amp; ENGAGING AVENUE FOR YOUR FRENCH STUDIES.

BUT MY CONVERSATIONAL FRENCH ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR SOMETHING LIKES THIS: No problem. Even if your french is prohibitively awful, it should still be a productive exercise. Also, hobbits.

1356267988.0,15bpjc,Stuck trying to improve from intermediate to advanced,mhsiah,24,1,11,"Hi! My native language is English.  I have been living in France for the last four years and I plan to hang around for few years yet.  I only ever took a brief introductory course at the beginning of this time; since then I have been entirely self-taught.  French is the only language I speak on a daily basis -- with girlfriend

And yet I really don't feel like I've improved past an intermediate level for a very long time.  On a regular basis I still need to ask people to repeat themselves, I still need most puns explained, my accent is still quite strong; bref, I feel like I'm stuck on a plateau which is still a thousand miles away from the fluency I have in English and I want to close the gap.

So what have others done in similar situations to break through to the next level

**TL;DR:** I have a decent level of French but I don't feel as if I have improved for the last year or so.  What do you suggest I do to improve?",self,t5_2rd5t,False,,L2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/15bpjc/stuck_trying_to_improve_from_intermediate_to/

Perhaps it's my personality, but I never experienced anything close to this. People were far more considerate than in my experience anywhere else (except Canada...)

Nobody ever replied to my French with English - with one exception, in a cave, where my French vocabulary didn't quite extend deeply enough into wine lingo. The only thing close to a ""scoff"" that I ever got was when I unthinkingly ordered ""un crème brulée"" in a restaurant, and even then, the waiter repeated my mistake before correcting himself and we all had a laugh. 

A couple of times

In Angers, they were still nicer than Chicagoans. At several points, I stopped random people on the street trying to get directions someplace, only to find out that the place was right around the corner. Nobody was ever rude or condescending.

I had French in school for a year and Duolingo kind of got me interested in learning French.

So I did a bunch of units in Duolingo but at some point

Well, pronunciation and actual usage of the language in conversations. Does Duolingo actually introduce you to the concept of formal addressing? If I remember correctly, they just accept the ""vous"" and the ""tu"" form as a proper translation. 

The audio that comes with this book is recorded by native speakers. I didn't think that the Duolingo audio was bad or something. The German one did sound much more robotic. But now that I actually hear native speakers speak (as fast as you'd hear it in a normal conversation and much slower) it's obvious that the Duolingo stuff is not exactly natural.

So

Also,  for you Androidians, my friend Google told me that it IS available on Android as well!",SlightlyAmused,22,5
So, I suppose. Well that's exactly what [Ruzzle is](http://www.rumble-app.com/) (link to the website, where you'll find both the iTunes and Android links. You can't miss 'em), except you can pick the language you want to play in, and i must say, their language selection seems pretty extensive. So I've been playing in French lately and, you know, usually. 

**TL;DR of the above TL;DR: Make French practice fun by playing *Boggle en Francais. Link is in above TL;DR.**

Heres the deal: French words have so many options when it comes to endings. I mean whoa. BUT this means there are many opportunities for hitting jackpots in *Boggle en Français*. Say you find *laisser* but oh shit! there's another 'e' and an 's' within reach, *laisses*, *laissées*, and *laissée*. There's likely an 'a' around too so you now have *laissa* and maybe even *laissas*. You'll feel optimistic at this point so you'll likely end up trying *laissae* because there are so many options that trying any and all 'a,e,i' ending combinations is a good strategy when you're pressed for time. 'i's or 't's? Even bigger win, not to mention the many other words and verbs you can make out of *laisser*, you've racked up like a million points but your opponent is probably not far behind (or ahead). Then you end up getting a round where there are very few vowels, it's a technical grammar term that involves neutral vowels

  
  As you can see


    If you're a beginner, even two occasions, that sonofabitch. On the other hand, I beat my 100%-born-and-raised-in-France- French mother every time (she just got the game the other day, though). Or maybe my family is just genetically bad at *Boggle en Français*, I don't know... 

Basically it's set up like your standard multiplayer word game: you can play with friends or if your friends suck (at) or don't play Boggle, which I've done many a time and never had an issue. Om the contrary, its been pretty even as far as skill level and I haven't encountered anyone that was annoyingly good or annoyingly bad. 


  Another thing is, and another game en español going *all at once* if you wish! *Note: I don't recommend doing this, because the brain gets pretty confused and achy due the constant switching of language gears over such a short period of time, but hey, whatever butters your biscuit!

The app is FREE

Anyway, I am sincerely sorry because I don't like those instances where I find myself wondering if I'm getting subtly bamboozled by sneaky marketers or if its legit, but I do solemnly swear [on my painfully cute kitten](http://i.imgur.com/xXICS.jpg) that I don't work for or know or am in any way connected with these Ruzzle folk nor do I know anyone who might be. It's just that I frequently see posts around these parts from people seeking different, perhaps more entertaining or engaging ways of learning/practicing french, and I figured it might be helpful to some among this lovely bunch of French learners/speakers/observers wanting to spice things up a bit...

1: *Actuellement* vs. Actually: This is a false cognate that also holds true in Spanish (Spanish equivalent: *Actualmente*) and is often mistranslated. In French, use *à vrai dire*, *vraiment dit*, or *en fait*.

2: *Collège* vs. College: Just as in many countries outside of the US where ""College"" refers to something other than university

3: *Déception* vs Deception: They look very similar,* it means ""I was mistaken"" or ""I was wrong.""

4: *Envie* vs. Envy: *J'ai envie de faire qq.ch* means ""I would like to do something (in the future)."" Clearly not the same thing as envy. The verb *Envier

5: *Opportunité* vs. Opportunity: *Opportunité* generally refers to an opportunity to be seized, ""J'avais l'occasion de rendre visite à mon ami, mais je l'avais laisser tomber"" translates to ""I'd had the chance to visit my friend, but I let it slip away.""

6: *Chance* vs Chance: *Chance* in French generally means ""luck"" rather than ""chance."" If you are wishing someone good luck, #5.


7: *Type* vs. Type: *Type* in French refers to a personality type or a genre of person, is translated best by using *Genre* or *Sorte*.

8: *Monnaie* vs Money: *Monnaie* refers to loose change and coins. To say ""money"" in French you would preferably use ""Argent."" The slang word for ""cash"" is *fric

9: Caractère vs Character: *Caractère* most closely means temperament and is used to describe someone's personality. A character in a book or a movie is most commonly stated as *personnage.*

10: *Attention* vs. Attention: *Attention* in French means ""caution."" If you are referring to attention, or *faire attention,* which is slightly less dramatic than *attention* itself.",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/a7cw8/intermediate_avoid_these_10_very_common/

I could do that with a native dictionary, so I knew that any new vocabulary I encountered in it was worth writing down and learning.  I didn't have to worry that I was off in the weeds learning obscure words or meanings.

Language defines things into existence. By not having an equivalent for awkward, an American might notice an awkward interaction or individual while in France, but the French could not perceive it as such).

I'm assuming the service is free because most of their market is in the US. Part of their package includes being able to speak with native speakers so they've opened it up to everyone.

The downside is that there are still not a lot of users (I'm going to re-post in a couple of more language learning subreddits because I think many can profit from this tool). I'm using Spanish - there's usually always an opportunity to find a native speaker learning English. I logged on past 6PM CST yesterday and didn't find any native French speakers on but perhaps when they're not sleeping

The way the games work is that you do the first 4-6min session (or for however long you want to chat) in one language

The site recommends you be at conversation level and won't let you check ""beginner"" for you language level (I'm guessing this is so they can get you to buy their product and learn) but as long as you're comfortable holding a simple conversation or talk about a simple topic prompted by the program

Here it is: 

Quand j'ai étudié à Montpellier au printemps dernier, me donnant une perspective sur la préparation nécessaire pour les études supérieur en France.  J’ai commencé à comprendre comment les Français abordent l'éducation et à envisager une place dans ce système pour moi.


Etudier en France a été une expérience enrichissante à bien des égards, je suis allée au gymnase et j’ai joué dans la cour de récréation avec eux.  Plus important encore, je leur ai appris leurs premiers mots d'anglais !  J’ai eu l’indépendance totale pour concevoir mes propres activités.  Ces enfants étaient un vrai plaisir à enseigner !  Je me sentais liée à eux comme une autre étudiante de langue et je trouvais le travail très agréable.  


Je considère l’enseignement de l'anglais à l'étranger comme un excellent complément à mes études.   Je me suis spécialisée en linguistique pour ma licence, j’ai l’habitude d’aborder les questions de langage analytiquement.  Mes études me donnent des connaissances métalinguistiques qui faciliteront l’enseignement de l'anglais aux francophones.  Je comprends la structure sous-jacente de l'anglais—sa syntaxe, sa phonologie, sa prosodie—et comment cette structure se compare à celle du français.  J’ai étudié les schémas d'acquisition du langage par les locuteurs non natifs et les difficultés ils rencontrent.  Je connais des techniques d’améliorer la prononciation ou la grammaire.  


Enseigner aux enfants en Montpellier a encouragé un intérêt à travailler comme orthophoniste avec des locuteurs non natifs ou dans un contexte international.   Il y a une demande croissante aux États-Unis pour les orthophonistes qui peuvent travailler avec ceux dont la langue maternelle n'est pas l'anglais.  Enseigner l'anglais me fournira l'occasion de travailler avec des locuteurs pareils.  Je gagnerai également de l’expérience d’habiter et de travailler à l’étranger.

1349518035.0,111c7z,A french learning experience,whyisrumgone,14,1,7,"Ok
background
Ok so, and late summer (age 25 now) 2011 I restarted learning it. At this point I had cereal box vocab and could probably order a sandwich, that's it (maybe A1 after 1 month lessons). However I was surprised that I still knew most pronounciation rules and had a good accent (says my gf). From that august until june 2012 I put in probably 1hour studying in the mornings 4-5 times per week. The goal was to get to B1 by june 2012. I used BBC mafrance, pimsleur, little workbooks, listened to slow news french. I have a swiss gf. She wasn't a miracle knowledge giver like a lot of people think. We are both in medschool. I did my french in the morning before my classes, and by the time we finish classes/ studying for the day

So beginning of july (course started the monday after last med exam) I enrolled to Lausanne university ""cours de vacance"" tutor 6week program where I needed to test B1 to start. When I got there I had barely used any spoken french, doing activities and breaking through using french daily. After 2nd test, the next 3weeks were in a B2 class with a bunch of borderline C1 students (prepping for attending french uni). Second 3 weeks were good classes also. (classes were 830-1200 with cafe break)

Tutoring part: during the 6 weeks I met 2xper week with a tutor

What I learned. That course was great, grammar and homework/vocab all to try and keep up. Cons, there are students from all over the world, and a lot of them have extremely difficult to understand accents in french. So group work can be somewhat like kicking water uphill sometimes. I was constantly tired, I was really driven to learn and that was the big factor. That full immersion without a big drive would be useless i think. I wouldn't reccomend it for a summer fun course or if you we're a total beginner. Immersion for me is better when you have a basis that you can build from. I found that in the beginning, I could understand all the words in speech, but the phrase meaning escaped me. After a while I could understand speech very well. But watching news and things

Need. In the year running up to the course doing french in the early hours before the day started sucked. Im learning french because I want to work in la suisse badly

French gf. Overrated. It's thrown around like a miracle for learning a language, use the language as much as you can in the beginning I would say.
So I guess I just wanted to share and say that even as a full time med student in a year you could be ""fluent"" in french. Could I survive living in a french place now? Yes, environment and slang vocabularies). I can read novels well, get almost everything from news and émissions, but slang and movies still escape me however thats apparently normal for B2.

Where should I look to find some help?,ChrisloriousHD,13,1,10,"I took 2 years of French in High School. I have always had a love for travel and I actually really enjoyed learning the language. I had a rough time learning from the book itself but I was able to pick it all up through oral practice very easily. At the time I had a friend from France on an old Nintendo DS game (Metroid Prime Hunters) and I learned a lot through talking to him.

It has been a little over 5 years since I stopped taking those courses and frankly I have forgotten almost everything. My grammar and punctuation in the language was always pretty good so I'm sure I could pick back up fairly quickly. I have been wanting to continue studying it for a good while but between school and other things going on in my life I just never felt like I had the time to do so. It just felt like an overwhelming thought.

I am planning on getting married next year and I would really want to go to Paris on my honeymoon. I really want to learn to speak the language fluently by then. I want to be able to take my time and immerse myself in the culture while I am there without having to worry about a language block.

I feel as though based on past experiences with the language that in order to do this I need to have a vast amount of just oral conversation in the language. I think the easiest way for me to learn would be to have a group of friends who natively speak the language that can talk to me on Skype from time to time. Of course I will use some other form of studying through text but for me that only goes so far. My girlfriend will be moving close to me hopefully within a month (from 2 1/2 hour drive to 5 minute drive) and I will hopefully be getting her speaking the language as well so we can just practice with each other often.

My main questions are:

* Where would I best be able to find some cool French speaking people

* What sort of text/learning program should I use?

TL;DR I really want to learn French and I would do best orally. Where could I find some good Skype friends who speak it as their first language and what learning program should I use for self study?",self,t5_2rd5t,False,,L2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1gofjc/im_very_interested_in_relearning_and_expanding_my/

First of all

I am an MS Computer Engineering student and I've developed a French dictionary extension for Google Chrome called popupDic (short for ""popup Dictionary""). The extension is designed to help beginner/intermediate learners of French who frequently read French texts/articles online better memorize new words that they come across. A short video tour of the extension's features can be found here: [http://youtu.be/bTHiU30ZFkg](http://youtu.be/bTHiU30ZFkg).

The extension has been developed as a semester project for one of my courses. As the next stage of the project

If you find this extension interesting and would like to participate, the project is due in the middle of next week, so it would be really nice to find some study participants by Saturday.

Thank you for reading.


**EDIT: Just wanted to add some clarifications.**  

* The extension is a dictionary app. It will only translate words piecemeal. It will not translate whole sentences for you. What it will do (hopefully) is to make it easier to remember new words.
* I am looking for people who are at **INTERMEDIATE-fluency** levels. Since that is rather a loosely-defined term

I did quite well, but after enrolling in the next level (due to start this week), it was canceled due to low enrollment. I'm admittedly a terrible self-motivator, so a scheduled class was perfect. So...now what?

There are no other appropriate courses I can make it to with my work schedule. The $300 I got back when the class was canceled almost pays for the full Levels 1-5 Rosetta Stone package or a decent start with Pimsleur. However

I didn't take any courses or even speak much French because I was only there for a week. I did explore many neighborhoods to improve my understanding of the local culture.

The best bookstore for language learning materials is [Librairie Michel Fortin](http://www.librairiemichelfortin.com/). They specialize in language learning materials and have everything! I spent $125.00 in this bookstore. 

[Renaud-Bray](http://www.renaud-bray.com) has many stores and you can order from them online. They have been my major supplier of Quebecois literature. I didn't find their Côte-des-Neiges flagship store to be that impressive but the store in the Complexe Desjardins had a good selection of Quebecois literature. There is also a Archambault store in the Complexe Desjardins.

Newspapers. The 24 Heures paper is free and can be found in metro station entrances (except on weekends). La Presse is also free and is handed out by vendors outside Berri-UQAM Station. Voir is free and can be found at some metro stations. Le Journal de Montréal was hard to find. Eventually I bought a copy at a Maison de la Presse Internationale store.

I had to buy an extra piece of luggage for all the books I bought! Here are some of my major finds:

* Petit guide de parler québécoi 
* Larousse Conjugaison
* Petit Futé Bruxelles (another culture to explore)
* Nouvelle-Orleans travel guide 
* Cajun French Dictionary
* Kit De Conversation Neerlandais (a French book on Dutch)
* Les Muses Orphelines by Michel Marc Bouchard (a play)

La porte n'est pas verrouillée, sans aucune crainte. Les pièces sont bien aménagées, la peinture semble être parfaitement assortie. Une bonne odeur semble s'y être installé. Quelque chose est en train de cuire, une brise agréable passe par la fenêtre. Tout me semble si serein, si paisible. Ce ne peut être qu'un rêve.

Je fixe le haut, 10 minutes, une simple petite vibration qui pousse anormalement ma curiosité à sa limite. Je mets un pied sur une marche, je finis par courir dans les escaliers

Paris, la ville où ces rêves meurent ou sont accompli. C'est l'histoire d'un homme et une femme jeune qui se connaissaient pendant une courte période. L'homme s'appelais Jean-Michael et la femme s'appelais Béatrice. Jean-Michael étais Québecois et il a voyagé à Paris pendant l'été pour trois mois. Il étais grand comme un arbre, maigre comme une brineille, mais avec des yeux noisette. Quand Jean-Michael a visité Monmantre, il a tacheté Béatrice dans la pharmacie qui est proche de la structure. Béatrice avais des cheveux noirs avec des yeux blue cièle comme la Méditerranée. Jean-Michael étais nerveux, mais il a assez de courage de s'introduir à Béatrice. C'est là où leur histoire d'amour a commencé.
	Avant de sortir
	Pendant les trois mois, Musée du Louvre, Normandy, et plusieurs des autres endroits tout au long de la France. À fin de ses aventures, Jean-Michael est tombé amoureux de Béatrice. 
	Les deux étaient sur un pont avec un vue sur la Rivère Seine. Le ciel étais rose et violet
	«Béatrice, non, je sais que c'est notre déstinée!»
Béatrice, ella a des rêves et des buts différent. Elle l'a renpondu:
	«Jean-Michael, je voudrais une vie comme ça, mais», elle soupire,  «j'ai des rêves et des buts que je veux et doit acommplir. Je préfère finir mes études, avoir un job, et être stable dans mon job. Je préfère attendre jusqu'à je suis prête pour un relation. Je suis désolé Jean-Michael.»
Elle l'a embrassé passionnément et après ça, il pleure, il pleure jusqu'à il est arrivée chez lui au Québec. Il s'a dit, «Paris, la ville de l'amour, la ville des rêves pour beaucoup des personnes, la ville où ces rêves meurent ou sont accompli. Mon rêve

* Photo #1: Some folk tale (?) of some saint that roamed around without his head for some reason.

* Photo #2: Some famous French painter who lived in Montmarte painted this building. Of course the van had to be in the way of it. ;/ The painter's name would be nice and perhaps a link to the painting.

* Photo #3: I completely forgot what the significance of this was.
