While I think that's great

1) Libertarians are NOT Republicans - despite the fact that the media loves to use ""libertarian"" as a pejorative when referring to republicans

While we are for small government

2) ""Personal freedom"" means ALL personal freedoms

Again, DUI laws, anti gay marriage laws, anti-abortion laws, the Patriot Act, the militarization of the police forces - anything that restricts personal freedom.

Yes

If any of that conflicts with your own beliefs


3) We don't support war or imperialism

Yes

But you're not going to get much sympathy from most of us,  and a worldwide US military presence to begin with.

If you have recognized that the ""superpower"" system has failed

If you're just calling yourself a libertarian to hide your shame at all the BBS posts you made declaring the Iraqis would ""welcome us as liberators""

4) unlike the GOP

If you hadn't noticed

We spend more time arguing with each other than we do arguing with other parties.

If you're expecting to come in here and have every post greeted with  and ""Amen choir"" like  they do on Free Republic

5) Bullying and slurs don't work here.

You can't pull that Rush Limbaugh/Bill O'Reilly crap here and expect to be taken seriously. As a group

Also

a) We ARE liberal about many things

b) we don't think along a liberal/conservative dichotomy to begin with.

Just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT 1: I just logged in again and...holy crap. I had no idea this would spark so much conversation. 

Couple of things I should clarify from reading the posts:

* I never meant to speak for ALL libertarians or lay out any sort of dogma

* regarding DUI laws abortion etc: being against repressive LAWS isn't the same thing as being FOR the behavior. 

I'm not advocating that people should be able to drive drunk; [I'm saying that violating people's 4th 5th and 6th amendment rights based on an arbitrary blood alcohol limit has been proven to be ineffective as a either a deterrent or a life saver

Similarly one can be against abortion

IMO

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone

He has erected a multitude of New Offices
He has kept among us

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province

For taking away our Charters

For suspending our own Legislatures

Here is the official Facebook Page

Here is information about the congressional district.

http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Arkansas's_3rd_congressional_district_elections

With no Democrat in the race, make a donation, etc. If you live in Arkansas, sign up to volunteer and get on the front lines. A win here would send a message across the nation that third parties can indeed win. More so it would rub dirt in the Republican's faces.

His opponent has voted to extend the Patriot Act, we can do very well.

**EDIT** I've just been informed that in Louisiana. THERE ARE 3 congressional districts where its a Republican 1v1 with a Libertarian. No democrats in these races. 

Louisiana has a huge Ron Paul grassroots movement (one of the states he won a majority of delegates) There is no reason why we can make a decent showing in that state. Get involved and get out the vote people!

Here is info on the 3 districts.

I lean pretty hard toward the Democratic party and I voted for Barack Obama in 2008. I've always thought Ron Paul was a refreshing candidate whom I really liked that unfortunately fell short of meeting my overall worldview. For instance, especially for a person with his education. I am against wholesale dismantling of government agencies. I am against applying a tax system that while labeled ""fair"" actually is horribly regressive against the less fortunate in this country while a boon for the rich. I have yet to see any empirical or even historical evidence that trickle-down economics works as advertised. I am pro-choice. 

However, and our overall military industrial complex at the costs of both money and human life, I have come to the conclusion that America needs Ron Paul. 

I may have to bite my tongue if he ends up getting elected and institutes measures I do not agree with. However, it is a choice I am ready to make.

EXAMPLE: “#BlackoutCNN like they have blacked out @GovGaryJohnson ! Include him in your polling @CNN .”

Remember not to use the tag until the given date and time! Tweet for as long and as many times as you can and retweet as much as you can. Get creative

*****************************************************************************

The third line of attack is a rolling call schedule for State Directors to use in conjunction with the Protest being Held at CNN. We will bombard their phone lines with requests to include Gary Johnson in their polling.

Generally

The Rolling Call Schedule starts on MONDAY JULY 16th and continues until we win! The calls should begin as a wave going from the East coast to the West coast producing a steady stream for at least 12 hrs each day.

CNN CALL NUMBER (404) 827-1500

STAY ON LINE UNTIL YOU CAN TALK TO THE OPERATOR. ASK TO SPEAK TO WHOMEVER IS IN CHARGE OF POLLING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. THEN ASK WHOEVER YOU CAN GET ON THE LINE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

""I would like for CNN to include Libertarian Nominee Governor Gary Johnson in their polling for the general election because he represents my views on many subjects

****************************************************************************

Our final attack will show our defiance of the hand-picked big government candidates! In combination with the protest and a twitter bomb

Every dollar counts, $25, or $50 towards the campaign and the efforts to be included in National media and the debates!

Every dollar we raise shows the media and the two-party establishment that we are fed up with the “choices” they force upon us.

On the one hand

67% involved guns. 52% were committed by blacks. It might seem that blacks are clear, fewer than [13% of Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) are blacks, and presumably, not too much more than 13% of American homes contain a black.

So now it's looking pretty rough for blacks. 67/52 = 1.29, but gun owners only manage to commit 1.29 times as many homicides as blacks.

To phrase it another way, the black is 2.8 times more likely to kill you than the gun owner.

**Do statistics like these mean anything at all?** Do black people cause murder? Do guns cause murder? Or do **murderers** cause murder?

Just to be safe

**DONATE TEN DOLLARS TO RAND PAUL TODAY**

Send a message! A small donation during Dr. Paul's filibuster will let him know that we hear him, you must tell him that his message is being heard!

1285174974.0,dhf7b,"The redditor arrested a few months ago for filming the police would like to thank redditors for their donations to his legal fund, and their support. The video and audio was tampered with (erased) by the feds, but recovered with open source software and linked within. ",rightc0ast,915,103, and in the middle of the video is a screen capture of the original submission. Warning: onions are cut at 13:00 :)

Sympathetic supporters skilled in computer forensics [have now recovered the audio and some of the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3YIhJyVwTs), from George. 

The TL;DR is that George was arrested for filming the interaction between Julian and the officers. This is all in the video

The video sheds a lot of light on the unjust attack, everyone there was immediately seen as guilty by association, and the video clearly shows an unprovoked attack on George, many minutes after Julian's mistake. The statements of the federal officers are also shown to be false by the video. They lied, simple as that.  

I'm sorry for any disjointedness here. I'm just writing from my heart. I'm still as upset about this as the day I called when they threatened to sic the FBI on me for harassment as soon as I said ""someone needs to do the right thing and demand his release, being so passionate about our rights to film and protest peacefully without being forced to divulge personal information and personal details on demand.

After all, or photography now ... is purely imaginary.

Thank you for helping the people who risk so much protecting these freedoms for us all. Thank you all.
