She stated that any gamertag that plays on this console will be a 'gold'. XB360 users will still have to pay for their individual accounts still. 

Also




EDIT: RegularJohn17 via /r/xboxone/ said it better than me

You pay for gold and you have a ""home"" console where your gamertag and all your games/dlc licences live. If any other gamer tag signs in on this (even if your not signed in) they can use your gold status even if they don't pay for gold.

If you go sign in at a friends house who doesn't have gold you can use the advantages of your gold but then when your friend signs back into his gamertag he cant use gold anymore.

Pretty simple really. It just means that families don't need multiple gold accounts anymore. Just one per console. At least that is my understanding.

After some investigating, and I notice my 15 month old daughter grabbing the XBOX remote, pressing the center button and turning the box on. She then proceeds to press every button on the blasted controller, and also moved around the control stick.

Intrigued

I understand that XBL has a strict ""no-refunds"" policy, and agreed to have the points added back to my account. We had a good laugh, and the experience was not only effective, but I wasn't on hold for more than a couple of minutes.

Then, so I basically got it for free. Not wanting to game the system, I called XBL support back and told them about the error, to which they told me that it was a gift for my young daughter, and she should wear it proudly once she gets to the age where she actually knows what she's pushing.

1353837716.0,13r7bz,Turning your Xbox 360 in to a Media Center via files streamed from your computer! (works with PC/Mac/Linux),HolyLiaison,176,47,144,"This is going to be long

If you want to skip to the bread and butter below just head down to the TL;DR which gets right to the point.

SO!

I just recently bought an Xbox 360 after having been a PC/PS3 guy since the beginning of time. I just couldn't help my self with all the sweet deals going on these last few weeks.

After years of using my PS3 pretty much flawlessly as a media center I decided to give it a go on my Xbox so I didn't have to switch between consoles constantly if I wanted to watch something in my collection. This is when things got a little interesting. 

Over the years I've used quite a few Media Servers: PS3 Media Server, PlayOn, Vuze, VLC, etc etc.. and I ended up settling on PS3 Media Server for my PS3 (more recently I switched to an off-shoot of it called Universal Media Server) since it usually played 90% of the stuff I wanted to watch with out too much hassle. So I figured any one of those would probably work great with Xbox 360. Boy was I wrong! 

Most of these servers could stream some of my video files to my Xbox

I came back still frustrated about it

I ended up going through almost every option on that list

Then I ran in to one program called [Plex Media Server](http://www.plexapp.com/). And things started looking great. Setup is kinda confusing at first because you do it all through a web interface

They even have apps on Android/iOS/Windows Phone 7 that let you stream remotely from your server to your phone/tablet

In the end I found my solution


**TL;DR**: Use [Plex Media Server](http://www.plexapp.com/) - it works fantastic with my Xbox 360,False,self,t5_2qhk2,False,,,t3_13r7bz

 (Since this has been done to death in this subreddit, [New to 360](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/mqh2p/new_xbox_360_what_games_should_i_get/), [Got money, what games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/ltcil/stumbled_into_a_few_hundred_bucks_what_games/) and [Hello McFly's well thought out list](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/nr25u/for_everyone_who_got_a_360_for_christmas/c3bawnn)

* Storage:
The Xbox 360 (either phat or slim) is sometimes bundled with some small amount of storage built in.  256mb, a few gamesaves, and maybe a bit of DLC in the slim. 

For additional storage you have two options; **external USB** or **internal hard drives**.  

With **external USB** you can attach USB hard drives or USB flash drives, [16gb thumb drives are pretty cheap these days](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Cruzer-Flash-Drive-SDCZ36-016G-A11/dp/B001T99ZTI) and would be a pretty ideal solution.   Note: With external USB drives if you want to use them for video/music they MUST be formatted to FAT32! 

With **internal hard drives** you gain the added bonus of backwards compatibility to Xbox 1 games as well as the ability to install games (something you cannot do with USB storage) not to mention their vastly larger capacity.  Installed games still require the disc in the tray to start up, you can bust the hard drive out of the shell, and slap it into a [cheap slim enclosure](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/internal-hard-drive-disk-case-for-xbox-360-slim-black-56461) and it will work.  **teamshred has correctly pointed out that the slim casing is not required, you can fit the bare drive in without it.

* Hardware / Accessories:

[Ventilation is important](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/nr25u/for_everyone_who_got_a_360_for_christmas/c3bbwb3).  Do not shove your 360 into an entertainment center and close the doors - the 360's worst enemy is heat.

Video Connection - If your Xbox has the option of HDMI out,yellow) then you might as well have got a Wii.   If you don't have HDMI then Component (red,blue,green) is good too, and can do HD resolutions. 

Protect your disc - they are fragile and scratch easily. 

Batteries - rechargeable battery packs are awesome and could save you a bunch when using wireless controllers.  Looks for deals online that are guaranteed to be cheaper than in brick and mortar stores.  Maybe people will have specific suggestions below. 

Headsets - Headset questions are another one frequently asked in this subreddit

If you have a ""phat"" 360, which is a notorious weak point still to this day. And along those lines, don't move your 360 while there is a spinning disc in it.
**Much credit to HardwareLust for this section. 

* Xbox Live:

Be careful attaching your credit card to your Xbox Live account.  Automatic annual billing is a pain in the ass to get removed

The first few (somewhere between 3-5) times you create a new Xbox Live profile on your console and select No to the ""Upgrade to gold?"" option you will automatically be granted a 1 month free gold trial. So if you are just trying to milk out having Live as long as possible without paying for it you could create a new account once a month for the first few.

The Family Pack - This is probably the best/easiest deal with Live. You get 4 gold accounts for $99/yr whereas a full price single annual is $59/yr.  You do NOT have to be on the same Xbox or even in the same household to use those profiles

Parental Controls - for those of you that might have little ones you are trying to be protective of

* Media Playback:

You have to have an Live Gold account to use Netflix or Hulu Plus - that sucks, or H.264 encoded MP4's and AVI's as well as MKV files now.   Lots of people here also use and really like [PS3 Media Server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/)  (yes it works with the 360 too) and I use and like [Orb](http://www.orb.com/en/download.html) and [PlayOn](http://www.playon.tv/index.php) as well.  PlayOn is a paid app but it transcodes not only your local video but lots of web content too.

1288951472.0,e1mpm,Kinect - First Impressions,ElHermanoLoco,128,24,66,"So I pre-ordered a Kinect and a few launch titles after playing with one a bit this summer

To get it out of the way, and if you can't play with one you absolutely should try.  But that doesn't mean it's without faults, room for improvement and impending growing pains.  I'm just really pumped for when they really kick this thing into gear and am more than happy to be the early-adopter guinea pig.

**Hardware**

The hardware is the coolest part to me.  The face recognition was spot on (I stepped in front, voice recognition works well (though I didn't really use it all that much), and the motion tracking is astounding.  To be fair, I approach it like a CS/Computer Vision nerd, so I just think the fact that it can draw a skeleton on two people, simultaneously, while correctly ignoring all background noise in real time is nearly instant nerdgasm.  It also works.  Really well.

There is lag, but other than maybe once I never really noticed it after the first few minutes.

It glitched out a few times

**Play Area**

We had to rearrange the furniture (I live in an apartment) and it was still a little cramped, but apartment dwellers can make due if they're willing to shuffle some things around.

**UI**

The UI in this is amazingly slick, that I was actually sad when I had to go back to buttons on the dashboard (there's a ""Kinect Hub"" which auto opens when you engage Kinect, but it can't do everything).  The controls for ESPN were fantastic, and I felt like I was in Minority Report.  The Hub is limited in what it can do, as mentioned above, and I'd really like to see support for remote video and Netflix added soon (couldn't find remote video in the hub, though I didn't look that hard).  Even without that

**Games**

* Bit of background*: I play lots of videogames (less now due to school), so I'm definitely not a ""casual gamer"" (though not all that hardcore).  That said, I'm sure the WoW/CoD/Starcraft/Minecraft/hipster addicts would look down on me for my taste in games (everything from TF2 to Madden).  So I guess just be aware that I come in thinking both WiiSports and CoD are really fun and entirely valid ways to game.

I got Kinect Sports, especially if I didn't have other games, but they should have included Sports instead).  

* *Kinect Sports* was the one I spent the most time with, Table Tennis was very impressive (more fun than Rock* Tabletennis, which I thought was surprisingly fun), and soccer was definitely an interesting take.  The motion tracking is in full form, and though there were a few ""oopsy"" moments while getting used to the motion tracking (kicking the soccerball on the upswing, accidentally shotputting a bowling ball, that kind of thing), really fun.  Much better than WiiSports IMO

* *Dance Central* was probably the most hyped, no controller = hands free for alcohol.

* The other surprising game for me was *Fitness Plus*.  I'm not a big fitness buff, really did.  Granted I'd feel like more of a manly man if I was lifting weights, but this shit got my heart pumping and turned calories burned into a high score.  This game isn't really ""fun"" in the traditional sense, because it really is workouts and if you're as out of shape as me you will get winded, but I felt better about myself once I finished this than I ever have after a marathon of CoD.  I could see playing it more than the others if only to get my pudgy ass into shape by way of a high score.  Plus the minigames aren't bad, especially the kickboxing box breaker one.

Note: I played these with my roommates, as it's unlike anything else out there.  Literally nothing can do what Kinect can do in terms of fitness games, WiiFit doesn't compare.

**Glitches/Bad Things**

Glitches do happen
Once when friends were playing on me and my roommate's account (calibrated to our bodies, walk out of the sensor area, and walk back in, which fixed it.  Not horrible, but not great.

There are small glitches here and there

* Whenever you walk in front of someone, so they have to wave their hand in front of you and ""reclaim"" focus.

* The Wave to sign on thing can be finicky to get to work every time.  Only happens once per session

* Pausing is done through a set movement of right hand at side, but I'd like there to be a way to set that to be more reactive.  There might be a way to fix it, it just wasn't apparent.

Mostly little things

**Good things**

* First and foremost

* The pictures the camera takes a certain points in the game (jumps, and add a definite party sense to the experience.  Yes, you will look ridiculous playing most of these games, but who gives a fuck, they're fun.

* The tech is unbelievable.  The motion tracking, in the ""it just works"" way.

* I played Adventures online with a friend halfway across the country, really cool.

* You can eat and drink while gaming without worrying about getting your hands dirty or putting down food/drink to play.  This was surprisingly awesome.

* This thing is fucking magic.  I've studied a lot of CS/CoE, but the methods used to do what it does are mystifying, and I realized I haven't felt that around tech in a while.

**Wrap Up**

This thing is a really, I got off my ass which felt good.  It has a few issues, but they're mostly software and can be ironed out with future releases.

**If you have some tutoring money laying around**, it isn't, especially since it really hasn't started to be used to its full potential yet.

I'd equate this with the first version of DDR.  It costs a bit more than is comfortable, you'll look like an idiot playing it and not care, and has the ability to drastically change an entire market.  Just like DDR or Donkey Konga eventually became Rockband 3 with a real guitar as an input, this is a novel tech that could lead to really, really cool things.  If you know someone with one, play with it for a while, it's worth it.

**tl;dr**

Kinect is really fucking cool, but definitely play with one for a while if possible and judge for yourself.",,False,self,t5_2qhk2,True,,

It isn't a premium theme (i.e. no custom ""My friends"" backgrounds and whatnot)

Directions are simple

**FOR BEST RESULTS (read: easier)** you should copy or move a theme onto the flash drive by (on the Xbox) going to System Settings-Memory-Hard Drive-Themes. Select one and copy it onto the flash drive.

Go to Gamecrave.net's [download page](http://gamecrave.net/?page_id=2) and download USB Explorer. Unzip it and run it

Select File-Open USB drive manually (or if it is the only external storage device select ""first USB Drive"") and navigate Data Partition-Content-FFFE07D1-000300000 (this is the theme location

I am not sure how to make premium themes

But guess what? This is /r/Xbox360, I'm excited as hell to own an Xbox 360. Let's recap all the positives for the 360 right now, especially in light of today...

* Cost of new system = ZERO. I already own a 360, or Potato.

* FREE GAMES. Two free games every month for the rest of the year. That's twelve games and I, good excuse to replay a classic for nothin'.

* WORLD OF TANKS! Do I know what it is? No! Does it look crazy fun? Yes! And it's free this summer for the Xbox 360.

* Remember that amazing looking game at the beginning of the E3 presentation

* Grand Theft Auto V, Assassins Creed IV, Lost Planet 3, etc. There is still A TON of amazing games coming to the 360, it is not a dead console.

* Last but not least, bitches.

1) Consoles don't get banned just for fun. The enforcement side of Xbox Live takes things very seriously and investigates things THOROUGHLY. All evidence resulting in a console ban is logged

2) Xbox Live support can't help you. They aren't the same group of people who ban consoles and they can't unban you. The enforcers don't talk to them either.

3) There are only three things that result in a console ban

Modifying the hardware to play pirated games.

Trying to phish for personal information.

Keep in mind that even with the right codecs installed

EDIT

**KEEP IN MIND you are only transcoding the file for it to be playable on your 360.**

As has been mentioned in the thread there are some alternatives to using WMC+VLC. You can download [CCCP](http://www.cccp-project.net/) as an alternative to obtain the codecs. You can use the following streaming services: [PS3 Media Server](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/), [Plex](http://www.plexapp.com/), etc.

You can also plug a flash drive into your TV if it has a USB input or even use external media servers like AppleTV

My apartment got robbed a few months ago and a friend just sent me a text asking if I got a new XBOX since I was logged-on playing COD: Black Ops.

When it was stolen I called XBOX support immediately and cancelled my account

I just signed into my xbox account online and found out that whoever has it has indeed been playing Black Ops as recently as a few hours ago. They've also been playing a few other games. 

I just want to know if there is anything I can do other than just sending them a very rude message. 

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

With me on this post is /u/tomliness. We're simply trying to see if there is enough interest in our idea, we will eventually require a small entry fee so we can provide better prizes.


Since January 2012, we created an Excel spreadsheet that allows us to easily compare our progress.


We recently came up with the idea of expanding our competition, but here is an overview of what we've discussed so far.



* You can play any games that you want, anything.

* No new Gamertags/accounts. You have to use existing ones. This is to avoid players who will start from scratch to unlock every achievement at their disposal.

* When you unlock achievements, we will use the dates they provide. Pro tip, don't wait until the final hour on July 31st to unlock achievements.


**1^st Place - Most Achievements Unlocked** [ you win a game of your choice up to the standard retail value of $60 ]
It's too easy to get a high Gamerscore

**2^nd Place - Highest Gamerscore** [ you win a $20 Microsoft Points card ]
This is fairly straightforward. Get the highest Gamerscore

**3^rd Place** [ ??? ]
We haven't yet decided on how to win 3rd place



Leave comments to let us know if you are interested. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, unless of course there is a huge turnout.

Mods of /r/xbox360, but you want proof or need to work with us to ensure its legitimacy, that's fine too.


**EDIT**

During the next week

Now since you all showed such enthusiasm today, provided you respond to me with your information. If you don't get back to me by next Sunday, you'll have to enter again. For now, all we will require is your reddit username and Xbox Gamertag. If you end up winning, we'll need more information so you can receive your prizes.

Right now, we're not going to win your prizes. We will also message the mods during the week and provide any proof they require so that you all know we're serious about the competition.

Thanks to everyone for showing such interest! We're excited to get this thing up and running in the next couple of weeks.


**EDIT 2 on June 17**

The turnout was bigger than we thought, no worries, you're in. If you simply said you're interested, I will message you tomorrow. If you get back to me with your gamertag, you'll be entered in a raffle (we'll video ourselves randomly selecting so you can see we're not screwing anyone over). We are going to allow 35 participants, and /u/tomliness and I are not included.

I also messaged the mods and am waiting to hear back from them, and this first July works out well. Odds are we'll look to expand, and a lot of people mentioned trueachievements.com, so we might look to them for some help with stat tracking. But that's looking too far into the future for now.

So check tomorrow for messages in your reddit inbox

The way it works is you get a couple points for clicking on their bing reward search terms of the day (is how I will phrase it, and a few more for doing any number of random searches on Bing.  I got 250 for registering a new email address, and then an extra 26 for clicking their links.

You can use these reward points to purchase things from their store, after the initial 250 points, and 26 per day (when I used it before, the reward values were different on different days, and there were some bonus points they threw out from time to time), you can get 400 free points in just over a week.  And after that, just under three weeks can get you 400 more points.

It's tedious and takes a while to remember to do it each day

I'm not getting anything by telling you about this

_____________________________________________


We've grown from a subreddit of a couple hundred that completed ~20 trades/month to a subreddit with thousands of users

We deal in mostly physical games that are traded for physical games.  Why that limitation? Because when digital trades became prominent in our subreddit they were spun off into /r/steamgameswap.  

Do we offer the ability to *sell* games for cold hard paypal?  No. Why?  Because there's already a subreddit for that - /r/gamesell. 

Live outside of US or Canada?  You can post in /r/gameswap without limitations.  We have a few UK swappers

For those who like collecting things, red mushroom and so on. 200+ trades earns you the pinnacle of Zelda - the Tri-force.

There are some rules

Why make this post?  To inform reddit that you don't need to leave reddit to find a great place to swap games.

Games are supposed to be fun. I think we can agree on that. I'm ok with a game giving me an objective, though I'm not a fan, It can be exciting barely getting something done just as the clock runs out.

Where the developers went wrong was in letting the clock determine who wins and who loses instead of the players. Take the very first mission... I played as a revolutionary and had to guard a door for a set period of time... that's easy enough. Done. OK, he's back again. Dead. God-damn it! I killed him within the time restraint, why...

Oh.

See as long as the clock is running the mission isn't over. In some weird sense of ""fairness"" the other team keeps getting chances to continue the escort mission even though I've already killed them all lots and lots of times. My actions don't decide who wins, but it doesn't matter how many times you KO the other character in 3 minutes, all that matters is who has the most health or is still standing when the clock runs out.

Here's a tip - forcing your players into doing the same god-damned task over and over again IS NOT FUN. Games are supposed to be fun

What took me a long time to realize is why I thought the game would be better. I attended PAX, I even got to interview the Splash Damage crew for a gaming blog. How could it have gone wrong from what I was shown? Easy. When they showed us missions in the demo, they only finished the missions once. When they accomplished something, they were done, they moved on to show us someting else. They didn't tell us that you'd have to sit there playing it over and over until the clock ran out.

That's not only the flaw in the game

The heartbreaking part for me is that I WANTED to like the game so bad. I like the art and design. I like the story

People are talking about the DLC and how the game can be fixed... the problem as I see it though is that the game was purposely built this way. You can't remove the clock without being fair to both sides of an objective. I guess you could do it the old fashioned way... instead of a timer for those doing the escort

The first thing I did was check my online bank statement and Windows Live billing history. The guy who got in my account tried to use an out-of-date card to add over $100 worth of points to the account. Fortunately

Then, they gave me a three-week ETA for a solution to the problem.

In November, is rather difficult to solve, and its ETA is actually three months. So, she told me everything should be set and done in about a week, two weeks tops.

Just before Christmas, but couldn't do anything - the recovery team is completely separate from his department, and cannot be reached by me, or anyone. Therefore, all he could do was update my report and hope someone got to it. I made sure to let him know it was somewhat ridiculous that not even he had a way to contact them before hanging up.

A week ago

And finally, in English, telling me the problem has been fixed. They forgot to restore my list of friends, but whatever, it wasn't that long anyway.

The upside to all of this is that they gave me the codes for two free years of Live.
