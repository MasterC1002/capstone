I have emailed them several times about the issue
 
This is killing esports.

The production value was significantly improved but still not quite on par with GSL or Dreamhack. I already can't wait to see what they come up with next year! =)

What Valve did do with this tournament is set the bar for supporting a game's competitive scene. From the free in-game spectator client, the pennant and broadcaster systems... all groundbreaking, and all no doubt soon to be copied. Really great to see Valve come through so well and I hope they can continue to be a pioneer.

    that it our website
    we are currently making a new website so that will be out soon
    Morbuzaan (7:53): I see
    Not a bad looking website
    iMp RusH (7:54): We have a porfesional Starcraft 2 team
    you guys would get benefits such as: overlays for streams
    you would be the manager
     (7:56): In the future we would be able to pay for the team to go to events
    such as LCS
    Morbuzaan (7:56): umm
    iMp RusH (7:57): I did not actually haha
    ~~~~~~~~~  
    iMp RusH (8:30): the 5 players on wazabi would be getting $100 a month
    the team as in our team bank account 
    Impulse eSports bank account
    Morbuzaan (8:30): That's obscene
    You expect to pay us $500/month total
    And then take 100% of our prize money?
    We've won more than $500 in prize money in the 3 weeks we've been a team
    iMp RusH (8:31): considering one of the only tournaments you won you only got $600
    Morbuzaan (8:32): I've talked to a number of organizations interested in our team
    And you're the only one that's planning on taking prize money
    iMp RusH (8:33): How much of the prize money are other organizations planning to take?
    Morbuzaan (8:33): 0%
    iMp RusH (8:33): then how do they make any money off of it
    sponsors wont give that much
    unless you are a top level professional team
    Morbuzaan (8:34): You'd have to ask them
    iMp RusH (8:34): That just makes no sense to me.
    Morbuzaan (8:34): Well it makes no sense to me why we would join your organization if you're planning on taking our prize money
    We'd literally be losing money to advertise your company
    iMp RusH (8:36): We are not looking to lose money by having a LoL team
    i guess were just on a different page.
    Morbuzaan (8:36): And we're not looking to lose money by joining an organization
    Why would we do that?
    I think you'll find every other competitive LoL team would agree with me
    iMp RusH (8:37): not sure how other organizations are offering that, goodluck
    Morbuzaan (8:37): Yeah
    ""Advertise our brand
    iMp RusH (8:38): good luck finding an organization that wont die off by having an LoL team

1313163466.0,jgu6q,An open letter to the Counter-Strike FPS e-Sports Community x/post because I want to get this out there,mRWafflesFTW,34,4,29,"It has been a long time coming friends. I consider myself lucky to have witnessed the golden years of competitive gaming FPS gaming in North America as a teenager and then later as a competitor. I remember playing in a pub, but I won’t bore you. I just want you to understand how important Counter-Strike and last night’s news of an impending new release is to me. 

Solidarity is critical. The split between 1.6, decimated the communities of each. Granted, the 1.6 community remained in Europe, but I am strictly referring to the North American scene. We can argue for years which game is better and why, but that’s not productive. Each has value, but we must consider this important question above all else: “How can we best kick off an e-Sports FPS revival in North America?” The simple answer is we must unify the tribes. If you want to play a competitive RTS there is only one option, Starcraft 2. The FPS e-sports community suffers from a million titles. Notice

Unification behind a new Counter-Strike makes sense. First of all, more robust Counter-Strike will allow for greater sponsorship opportunities. Spectators will appreciate the upgrade. From a competitive stand point only a Counter-Strike sequel possesses the clout to unite the distinct tribes of FPS behind one flag. It’s been 12 years, and there have been no contenders outside of the franchise for the FPS e-sports throne. 

Years ago during the CS:S, CZ, CS:S, and CS:GO. All of us started out in a public server before venturing forth into irc and #findscrim, and therefore the last thing we needed was another separation. This still holds true.

We also need to improve our community. The CS community holds of honor of being regarded slightly higher than the infamous cesspool that is League of Legends and HoN. Look at the fan interaction in Starcraft. Look at how the entire community bands together with the common goal of improving everyone’s skill level and the state of the game. Secrets are shared and strategies are rapidly advanced. I know there is difference because of the one versus one adversarial nature of Starcraft and the team oriented tradition of Counter-Strike. In CS the mentality has always been “us, and I miss the trash talking on the old CAL Forums just as much as anyone (for those that remember professional troll MikehMike played for us), but we need to keep in mind that the community will need to support itself. 

We cannot count on Valve for anything. They clearly have no idea what they are doing. Look at their plans for the DoTA 2 launch. Who plans a 1.7 million dollar tournament for a game no one can play? Even I,000 dollar tour stops for DoTA 2 after release. That way gamers would purchase the game in an effort to win a spot at a tournament, and in addition keep the game in the news. Valve holds the highest selling, most competitive, longest longevity team FPS which is center in the collective e-sports mind, plans to release a sequel, but is unsure if they will host a huge tournament? I am so glad Valve is a private company

Maybe I should re-title this piece “An Open Letter to the FPS e-Sports Community”. I want all of us to Unite. I want 1.6, Call of Duty, Brink, AvA, Quake Live, and yes even the two guys still playing Unreal Tournament. Step up. Play hard. Go Pro.

Building a forum is interesting.

Right now we have about a dozen active users. That's not a big number (though judging from what I've read

That's a big part of what I'd like to see. I wonder if it's possible to build a decent sized forum (as opposed to aiming to be the next TL, etc) where the level of discussion and content remains high. I don't want to run tournaments or own a team, I'd just like to promote good discussions.

I disagree with MLG's payment policies and their handling of KESPA. I'm asking people to do this to help e-Sports

I originally put this on the r/starcraft and have decided to put it here too as e-Sports isn't only pertinent to starcraft players.

I am hoping that the community can pull together to create some attention for the upcoming MLG in Anaheim. I know, facebook, twitter, or whatever.

First

[A Press Release of MLG on MSNBC]
(http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47629944#.T8us8MWp2So)

[A Today Show Article](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/47636148#.T8us9sWp2So) Describing CBS Interactive buying up the advertising rights to MLG and other pro gaming organizations.

[A CNBC article](http://www.cnbc.com/id/47633993) that is exactly the same as the Today Show Article

So


Next

&gt; * Money Talks. Total prize pool is $195K.
&gt; * Prove it is professional. Mention CBS Interactive acquiring advertising rights. Mention that players are on professional teams
* Stress that it is international. There are players competing from different continents.
* Mention the fact that it is something mainly distributed online. Media loves stories about the internet and a changing society.
* Mention any top players that are really young (like Leenock/Maru) and will be playing at MLG. Media loves this kind of stuff. For example
* Mention date and location. Other than the national news giants

Next

National News Stations

&gt; * [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10285339/)
This has the most current info with the 3 articles listed above. Nothing really deserving of the title ""story"".
&gt; * CNN 
They have two feedbacks that are titled ""News Tip"" or ""Story Idea"". I'm not sure which is most appropriate. I leave to you to decide.
[CNN News Tip](http://www.cnn.com/feedback/show/?s=newstip)
[CNN News Story](http://www.cnn.com/feedback/show/?s=storyidea)
* [Fox News] (http://help.foxnews.com/entries/500736-where-can-i-send-story-questions-corrections-or-news-tips) Has articles mentioning MLG from 2008. I hate to admit it
* [Marketplace from American Public Media](http://www.publicradio.org/applications/formbuilder/user/form_display.php?form_code=53214004afb5) This is actually a national public radio show about business news that I like to listen to once in a while. They sometimes run stories about niche business news. When contacting them some history of the business side of eSports may catch their interest. Maybe focus on the online distribution? Best part


Local News to Anaheim/LA

&gt; * [Local NBC]
(http://www.nbclosangeles.com/)
Email is in upper right corner.

They often do bits where they interview people at conventions/events. Sometimes the fans are the butt of the jokes. It's up to you to decide if they are worth contacting. Personally

Why are you personally hostile against console gaming? (if you are)

Do you consider competitive console gaming respectable as eSports?

Have you ever had any experience with competitive console gaming?

Have you ever tried to tune into some stuff like during an MLG? (and how you felt watching it)

Do you think competitive console gaming will every be respected as much as something like Quake

EpicRewind is video capture software that has a key differentiating feature: RAM RollingBuffer mode. This works like an on-demand instant-replay: a game is hooked and the video is continuously buffered in system RAM, encoding and writing to disk only happen when you choose to save a video clip. During video buffering, the contents of the framebuffer are just being copied to system memory X times per second based your specified capture FPS.

Key advantages of the RAM RollingBuffer:

    You don't need to pre-plan a gaming video
    Ideal for MMOs and Multiplayer games where 99% of the gameplay isn't worth sharing and the interesting stuff can happen at unexpected times.

Added benefits:

    One of the best benefits is that it saves you time by eliminating the need to dig through all your saved gameplay footage to find the good stuff.
    Saves disk space by not writing countless hours of video to disk your just going to throw away later after you dig out the highlights.
    More efficient use of system resources by not processing and encoding video the entire time your gaming.

You can find more information about EpicRewind here on our website along with some demonstration videos:

http://epicrewind.com

We are at the point now where we have a usable beta build and are looking for more folks to try it out. If this sounds interesting to you feel free to send me a PM and Ill get you signed up

When MLG failed to gain Street Fighter 4 from Capcom, trying to make up excuses for why a partnership wouldn't work. To avoid people saying no one from the FGC contribute anything positive because they want everything to fail, and because IPL seem more open to suggestions,  I've decided to throw this out there. I don't claim to be to the ultimate authority in the fgc (there is no such thing).
After reading an interview with David Ting which he stated that he wanted ipl-fighters to be more of a spectacle and energetic

It is right in the sense that his overall direction is on-point. Fighting game majors bring the hype
 The most important hype machine to get to come to your event is an electric crowd. Don't believe me? Watch the famous Daigo full parry video again on mute and stop watching when it begins to show the crowd

Though, they play, Daigo wins, the crowd explodes in excitement. What actually happened? That version of SF4 was remembered as easily the worst and most unbalanced . Daigo? He ended up switching to Yun like everyone else. 

But this is written to help and not just criticize
Unlike other competitive gaming scenes, East coast is famous for playing lame. Perfectly willing to run the clock, chip you to death, and overall constantly harass you with safe long range pressure in order to force you into making a mistake. West on the other hand (SoCal especially) is usually pioneering US rushdown style, fast block strings, frame traps, 50/50 mix-ups, so a big 10 vs 10  east/west blow up has been talked about since sf alpha 2

As an aside I would like to add that the fighter crowd really does not like esport style commentators at all. We much prefer extremely knowledgeable ""color commentators"" like ifc Yipes. It would be a shame for him not to be allow to commentate for fear that he might to too ""urban"" or rowdy. Yipes has been on the mic for team spooky for a long time now

I know alot of the computer crowd dont like the FGC but since ipl is esports andthe fact that ipl has stated they often check subreddits I felt it was appropriate to put this here.",self,t5_2r08k,1354902877.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/esports/comments/14gbiw/how_to_make_streetfighter_successful_for_ipl/

I think that the money Riot is throwing out there is basically forcing the other MOBA games to throw tons of money into their own scenes before they are ready. Do you think HoN is really ready to enter the 6 figures prize pools? Probably not but what other choice do they have?I'm sure it is making S2 uncomfortable. How about Valve and giving away over 1 million for a game that isn't even in beta yet...that is just ridiculous.

* The metagame is evolving towards more flag play and constant action. Offensively oriented teams are succeeding. 

* [Dodgepong](http://twitch.tv/dodgepong) and crew are producing high quality streams with multiple in game cameras for match coverage. Makes the viewing experience tenfold more enjoyable.

* HiRez hired community member and competitor '[APC](/https://twitter.com/hirezapc)' to work exclusively on community development.

*  NA Tribes League is right around the corner and will be the first 'consistent' league structure for the game. [Click here for more info](http://natribes.com/league/).

All this combined with the [XP cost of all items being halved](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/01/24/tribes-ascend-is-halving-the-xp-cost-of-in-game-unlocks/) and the new patch (3 new CTF maps?) around the corner makes me quite encouraged.

With the final day of the Medic update

Yup, with buyers of the game labelled as having a ‘Premium’ account, and free players having a…free account. To convert a free account, all you need to do is purchase one item from the Mann co store in game.

Despite the many misgivings people have

Read on to find out more on getting the most out of your TF2 experience!

Maximise your FPS

First of all, for those of us who aren’t technically minded, the lovely Chris has built an entire set of configs, with great instructions, that will get you enjoying the game with the minimum of fuss, and the maximum of FPS. You can find these configs over at: http://www.fakkelbrigade.eu/chris/configs/ – but please make sure you follow the instructions carefully.

Competitive Play

Tf2 has a dedicated competitive playerbase, and map pools are varied. It is relatively easy to get into playing competitively, with teams constantly recruiting, and even creating your own team is relatively painless, as long as you know 5 other players!

Some great resources to get into competitive play can be found at the primary EU leagues
http://etf2l.org/forum/league/topic-12510/

If you’re after information on the goings on within the Competitive TF2 scene, with a great lineup of casters involved. http://www.vanillatf2.org/

For more US orientated gossip

Finally, join a lobby and get playing!

Custom Huds

While the default HUD is pretty nice, Community HUD (this is the one I use), gmang Hud, M0reHUD. These are all used to a certain extent by the community as a whole. http://etf2l.org/forum/customise/?recent=313540

Frag Videos

If you needed more persuasion to download and install a free game

Some of the best:

Lan Trilogy – by far and away one of the most epic TF2 movies

7 brothers who aren’t brothers – widely accepted by many as the definitive TF2 frag video
http://video.alienwarearena.com/movie/1085/7_brothers_who_arent_brothers/

Auto Aim – A great sniping video by one of the best snipers in TF2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZLJeQ1Nhc

Props to ""Trell"" for putting this piece together. Just trying to spread the word around.

Head on over to ETF2L.org and get involved. or Gotfrag if your from the US.

As it is now, and I couldn't take it because they'd always be spectating some player getting fancy on a box in the bomb site, when you'd glance in the topright corner and realize 3 kills just went down that you totally missed.This makes for FPS being a pretty drab viewing experience as you only have a 1 in 10 chance of actually seeing a frag from the killers POV.

But like 30 minutes ago

Essentially, nade toss, or objective completion occured, and bring the camera to it. Instantly making any FPS every bit as exciting to watch as something like Starcraft or DotA.

I know it probably isn't most peoples cup of tea here

Guild Wars 2 changes this like Guild Wars did. Where your armour/items doesn't matter and not having to do any PvE (Near enough)


**Battle of Kyhlo (Conquest mode)**

&gt; Two teams of five players are matched up against each other. The objective is to be the first team to reach 500 points. Points are awarded through holding capture points and kills. There are 3 capture points on the map, the team with the most points will be declared the winner after the 15 minute time limit. The average time for a game is 8-13 minutes, depending on the balance of the teams contesting. 

[MAP](http://images.mmorpg.com/features/5509/images/gw2pvp2.jpg)


In a tournament setting I am guessing it will be best of 3 or 5 maps. There has only been 1 map released so far but there has been announced that there will be many more but not sure how many. Each map has a gimmick for instance Kyhlo's is a trebuchet that can fire over to each point dealing massive damage. 

--------------


I have a few concerns if it will be good and wondered what other people think. Some of the biggest problems I am thinking of is that GW2 is based around mainly the objectives and not fighting. If you compare it to other games such as CS/LoL/SC2 the objectives aid the game but don't rule it

In GW2 it has very similar qualities to League of Legends Dominion which has been scrutinized as a bad mechanic. Meaning that it's all about the mobility and not fighting. In a way, MMOs are different.

It's hard to also say as the game is not out yet how well fighting will be fights could last a long time or could be quite short compared to other MMO's which have healers. Can GW2 pull of other modes than conquest. Maybe ANet has chose conquest because a 'deathmatch' mechanic wouldn't work. I had always thought a TF2 style of objective points would be much better in GW2 than what conquest is because it forces the fight rather than making people run away.

Will this be fun to play or watch? I just wondered what other peoples thoughts are on this really.

1298530988.0,frnac,Ingredients for a spectator e-sport,solomute,15,3,8,"I would define a spectator sport as a sport that people watch despite not being players themselves

So what goes into making this happen? Here are my ideas:

* A vastly higher skill ceiling than skill floor

This one's pretty obvious. You need a game where the very best players will wipe the floor with the noobs. You can't have a sport where practically anybody can reach the tournament. This is for a few reasons - The first is identifiable players. You need to have a decent core group of players who can consistently reach and win tournaments to act as recognizable icons of that sport. Golf has Tiger Woods, Quake has Fatal1ty (just picking who the public would be most familiar with, not necessarily who is successful right now). The second reason is that a game that anyone can win doesn't attract competitors who want to be the best - they will tend to leave for games where their efforts at gaining skill will be rewarded more.

So how much higher should the skill ceiling be? My thought is that there should be at least four distinct tiers of play, so the highest levels of tournament play should feature teams and players who can achieve ELO ranks at least 1600 points above those of teams and players who do not seriously apply themselves to the game.

Another consideration is that the potential skill ceiling of the game should be beyond human capabilities - If the ceiling is within human capabilities

* It has to be easy to watch

It should be fairly simple for a spectator to watch the game from start to finish and not miss any of the events which significantly affect its outcome. Especially if the game is divided into individual ""rounds"" or ""plays

This is where I feel like Counter-Strike really fails. The action is so spread out over the map that especially as a casual viewer watching a demo or hltv, but it's practically impossible to miss a frag. Quake matches can also be pretty hard to watch if you don't know the map (I still haven't internalized the layouts of even some of the most popular 1v1 maps since I only play CA myself). Fighting games are very easy to watch. Starcraft takes some knowledge of the units before you can really know what's going on, but a good VOD cameraman will catch everything significant. TF2 focuses the action around the medics and control points in a way that is pretty easy for a veteran cameraman to help the audience keep up with it, though you will miss a lot of the action on the flanks (you hardly ever see scout fights in live VODs).

* It has to be fun to watch

This mostly has to do with the pacing of the game

This is the problem I have with Counter-Strike and Quake, just to kill as many enemies as possible and force them to spend money. Watching a round where you're saying ""well, I know this team's going to win, the question is by how much"" is not terribly exciting. Same deal with Quake, a very good chunk of the match is spent with one player or another in a ""down"" position where they are not a serious contender for a frag, and maps very frequently end up one-sided even between evenly matched opponents simply because one player got map control and the other player couldn't break it. I think that a good chunk of what makes a game fun to watch is the potential for any individual play to go huge - in American football, any play can be a touchdown

tl;dr E-sports need to be entertaining for non-players to watch in order to get popular.",self,t5_2r08k,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/esports/comments/frnac/ingredients_for_a_spectator_esport/

1360123381.0,17za89,Need help to find a place for my burning passion with E-Sports. ,Chevelle89,14,3,3,"Hello Reddit Community

After tweeting around a bit on Twitter asking for help I had Steelseries point me towards Reddit because I am looking for some advice regarding E-sports. I’l l get to that in a second though

My nickname is Chevelle and I’m 23 years old and live in The Netherlands. I do currently have a parttime job but it’s only something temporary and I do have a lot of time left aside.

Now I have a huge history with gaming. One of the very first games I played seriously though was at the age of 12-13 when I got Counter-Strike: Source. I have been given chances in that game even though I was young and took those chances and got up to a high level of play. After 4-5 years of playing Counter-Strike I ended up having real life friends convince me to try World of Warcraft. I instantly got hooked and started playing that hardcore. In The burning crusade I ended up raiding end-game and same for Wrath of the Lich king and Cataclysm. In cataclysm I even ended up setting up my own 10 man guild and leading/managing this … this has been going on for roughly 2 years now. (having my own guild that is) I do all this with a burning passion. And that is how I do it and hope to continue doing it for many many years.

I’m looking to perhaps grow my guild into several games. (we are currently working on a new website which will not only represent WoW) One of my ways to grow our popularity and get our name out there is starting to stream. I have started streaming roughly 2 weeks ago and stream pretty much every day (WoW and Starcraft2) I do this for pretty much 6 hours a day quite easily. 

I actually managed to attract 25 viewers at one night by giving away 2 Heart of the Swarm beta keys to random viewers which was a great success and felt great to do! Everybody was so happy and I just loved doing it 

Now after that little story about me … if there’s any gaps you’d like me to fill please do ask. But let me get to my actually issue now. I have been poking around on Twitter for support and guidance as to where to go now. I want to get bigger with streaming and want to grow my guild into an actual organization if possible. But I’m not sure on how to approach this. I was lucky to get my hands on HoTS beta keys to give away. But it’s hard to get my hands on anything else to make people happy with without spending too much of my own money … which is very limited.. I only work a parttime job and do not earn a great living with it.

Now I was hoping if there were people around here that could help me with this. Help me find a way to make this work and help me do what I love doing which is gaming and entertaining. So far feedback on my stream has been great with the 10-15 viewers I get a night at the moment people seem entertained and I communicate with my viewers a lot and try being the best I can be for their enjoyment.

Please help me make the gaming community a better place 

Thanks a lot in advance

Regards
Chevelle.

How come europe has never warmed up to fighting games, and SC2? The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that in dreamhack, SF4 is booed every tournament when it comes on the main stage.

Why does the FGC see drama and celeb status of players in a much different light? It takes alot for the FGC to get pitchforks

I'm a massive SC fan which in turn got me into K-Pop, I decided to take three months off life back home in Norway and just experience Korea. And after being here for a month I want to try to find a way to sustain staying here longer.

It might sounds weird to ask, I never saw myself getting a job in the eSports industry. Since I'm from Norway the eSports scene is rather small and I don't think there's many people actually living off of eSports back home. From what I've managed to gather, there's basically no one except for a few competitors.

But now that I'm in Korea the possibilities are much bigger as there is an actual industry here. There might be foreign companies searching to establish something based in Korea, like LoL. I've seen that firsthand down here and it's freaking huge! I want to see all eSports grow.

Sitting here I'm not sure what more to write or what I'm hoping to get out of this.

I'm not an expert in any field whatsoever, I consider myself a good people-person. Just getting in there and talking with people I've never met before is something I love to do.

I never really thought of this as necessarily the best way of running a tournament

1326843026.0,olk61,From eSports Pioneer to Funeral Director: The Story of Chris Lemley and Team Pandemic.,Portlande,10,2,6,"I have no where else to appropriately publish so this is exclusively for reddit for now. I thought the community might find this interview interesting

Around 2002 Mark Dolven started Team Pandemic which quickly became one of North America's premier multi-gaming organizations. In it's prime, as Mark Dolven and many others in the industry went to the Championship Gaming Series (CGS), Chris Lemley took over team Pandemic and stayed with it until its retirement. 

**Could you start by stating your name

&gt;My name's Chris Lemley, Arkansas.


**That's quite a contrast of careers

&gt;It's hard to compare the two
&gt;
&gt;My life is much more stable these days,' but I don't know that I could have the family or the security that I do today if I was still chasing that dream.


**Would you go back to a job similar to the one you had if eSports was more stable?**

&gt;I think about it from time to time, and my move to the funeral home are largely the same reason I don't see myself leaving, now.  
&gt;
&gt;At the end of 2008, saw their stock drop by more than 50% in a matter of days.  Everyone was struggling financially and esports was in a very uncertain state, but we tried to carry on.
&gt;
&gt;The longer we operated in a state of limbo, keep holding onto faith that other sponsors would come aboard -- not just to our own organization, but to events as well.  We weren't even sure what tournaments would happen even if we could afford to get teams to them, *everyone* was struggling.
&gt;
&gt;In the fall of 2009


**Do you still keep tabs on esports in general?**

&gt;Only through my close friends that are still involved in some way.  I'll see news in my Twitter timeline that piques my interest from time to time


**Pandemic was once as big as or bigger than a lot of the teams that are still big players today like EG, Fnatic. What was the highlight of your pandemic career?**
 
&gt;If I had to choose one,000. We just couldn't miss that year... the other 'powerhouse' American organizations of the time had sold out to CGS and the entire independent side of the industry was ours for the taking, and quite frankly, nobody even came close for a long time. That year we signed the largest corporate sponsorship *(Pandemics deal with Dell Unitversity, which was an umbrella effort for Dell, Intel, and Microsoft)* eSports had seen to date, and everything we did seemed to go right.


**Regarding sponsors, had been among the first to sign sizable team sponsorship deals. What was it like for you personally garnering those sponsorships, what did pandemic do different than other teams in that regard?**

&gt;I can't even remember what my mindset was going into those meetings, fresh out of college facing down the suits at Dell for my first real 'business meeting..'
&gt;
&gt;Somehow it worked
&gt;
&gt;At one point in the meetings, in comparison to baseball, we were like a minor league team, a major league organization or what.  He didn't even know if we were any good. And it didn't matter. He somehow entirely missed out on what we believed was one of the core values of my presentation, but picked up enough from the rest to green light the deal.  From that day forward I realized none of these sponsors (besides the truly gaming endemic, such as Razer and Steelseries) would likely ever understand a thing about what we actually were.
&gt;
&gt;...It always felt like I was selling a make believe industry.


**What did those big tech companies care about

&gt;There's no rules to what makes a pro gamer, in retrospect, made no sense at all... but who were we to tell them they couldn't spend their money with us in that way. Others sat back and let us do what we do, latching on to our own campaigns and natural initiatives.
&gt;
&gt;The 18-24 year old male demographic gets referred to as the 'Holy Grail' of advertising. Supposedly we're the hardest to reach
&gt;
&gt;Things were a little simpler then. You hadn't had any failures yet (CGS, it was fresh... Internet functionality wasn't as developed as it is today, and online leagues were few and far between, so tight knit communities formed and it was easy to focus on specific leagues and events instead of this overload of competing ideas and clones that we have today. Console gaming hadn't really entered the online market yet, either, so it was easier to concentrate focus on one system (PC) and a handful of titles.
&gt;


*(During the end of Pandemic's lifespan

**Do you have any thoughts on Starcraft 2

&gt;I'm happy to see it uniting some of the focus back into one game. I haven't kept up enough to comment on the state of the game or the industry around it


**There has been talk of eSports being a bubble market

&gt;Our entire country was operating inside a bubble market when it popped in 2008/2009, and alot of my former peers will be upset with me saying this, I don't believe that the vast majority of eSport organizations/teams offer enough return on investment to be worth the risk companies take in doing business with them.  Ask yourself how many peripherals, laptops, mice or whatever must be sold -- as a direct result of your involvement with these players -- to simply break even on the cost of travel and salary for those involved.
&gt;
&gt;The ones that remain in business have done a phenomenal job of adapting and coming up with new ways to expand their reach and further their appeal
&gt;Event organizers are the ones who hold the power to create such an environment

I'm doing a study on socially active gaming. I'm trying to get a feel for how gamers would respond if they had the option to play/spectate in a social environment instead of just at home alone. I want to prove that nerd-gamers like myself aren't the socially inept people we're stereotyped as. I recently started a Starcraft II club at my university

That being said

1. What keeps you interested in E-sports?
2. Do you enjoy playing your respective game by yourself or with others? 
     * If with others
     * Are there specific games that you like playing alone
3. What sort of events would motivate you to leave your man cave and play in a social environment?
4. Do you like conversing with others, about your game?
5. Do you currently have a place that you go to play with your friends (or even strangers)?
     * If so
     * What kind of environment is it?

Who are the best writers

(Being a caster is great but if all you do is cast games

For the past several years, SF4, etc. I'd love to hear your opinions and for you guys to link to their work.

My nominees for SC2:

DjWheat (djwheat.tv) - The multi-gaming master is taking a relative break (ie he's only hosting the biggest online tournament in the world and not doing the million other pieces of content he usually pumps out) but he's still one of the best.

Artosis (gomtv.net, is good at the game and still finds time to give us tours of pro houses and interviews of otherwise inaccessible Koreans. He is the man.

JP McDaniel (youtube.com/itmejp) - MLG guru and content machine. SC Center

Evoli (formerly of GosuTrolling

Andrew Clark (ESFI) - Probably the least known of the group, breaks stories and is now flying out to some European events. If he keeps it up, he'll be known in no time.

Apologies to those obvious dudes and ladies who I inevitably forgot. I'll update this as I remember more.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please cross post this to some other communities because I want to discover talent from other games

1364401962.0,1b4905,Unpublished interview I did with artosis about a year ago (xpost from /r/starcraft),rabidbot,7,0,0,"Nothing to hard hitting in here



**I want to start of off saying thank you for time Artosis I know your busy leading nerds to the promised land.**


 **Ex-Brood War pro, one the best commentators in the world, t-shirt mogul,upcoming video game character, talk show host, community leader, and king of nerds. How do you balance it all?** 

It's really hard to keep a balance. I just try my best to keep on top of things



 **When you’re ahead

I try to, and attack too quickly after getting ahead.



 **What has been the most enlightening thing about having a child and have you found a way to turn this into gaming prowess yet?** 

Out of all the things I've done in my life, Basketball, etc.). Now that I have a baby, I have more perspective. My passion for StarCraft has not diminished in the least, (infect it may be stronger than before, somehow....), but I've calmed down a lot. More patience with myself or something.


**With all these commitments jockeying for time in your life

I always see myself doing that in some regard. Not that I ever plan to stop commentating or anything like that



 **So it is finally happening

Nothing really worries me about it. I'm so excited to see the slight differences in styles and thought processes between the two scenes. It will also be awesome when some of the most talented and hardworking professional gamers of all time finally begin to catch up and play in the same tournaments as our current crop of top pros.



**I know it’s early, or have we seen his peak in brood war?** 

If he wants to do it again




**How big a deal is age really for competitive Starcraft 2?**

 
What matters is motivation. I hate people quoting ages as if they matter. Older players begin to have more on their mind



 **How important is cross pollination (Koreans in international tourneys and foreigners in Korea) for esports?** 

Its pretty important. If no Americans or Europeans can compete on the world class scale, but I think it would hurt it.



 **Do you think oversaturation is possible in regards to Koreans in western tourneys?** 

It matters who the viewer is. Do you want top skill



 **It seems like the western scene as a whole isn’t on the level of Korea’s. Is it just a matter of more focused and structured practice (i.e. team houses) or is the foreign scene missing something more that is holding it back from the korean level of success?** 

Ugh. It's a mixture of everything. Instead of saying what, let me say what Koreans do.

They live together.
They practice all day
They talk about the game together when they are not playing.
They don't think about what team will give them 500$ per month as opposed to 400$ per month. Most of them don't even make a dime.
They don't get angry when they lose. They type GG



 **If you had the power would you rather the starcraft scene be a collection of different sized tournaments or a more structured conglomerate 

I'd like to see where it goes from here. I like having lots to choose from


 
 **What excites you most for the next year in sc2?**

Just the opportunity to watch/play/cast more SC2 for at least one more year while making my living off of it!



 **What GSL player should the community be paying attention to that is currently flying under the radar?**

MVPSniper maybe. Damn did that guy make some insanely good decisions in his Code A matches!

 

 **Who is the best team in the GSTL**? 

Harder question than it seems! StarTale is on fire. IM looks like it should be called Invincible Monsters. Hell




 **How important is a crowd for live events?**

I think that the MLG Arenas have shown that its not 100% necessary. The crowd is amazing



**If aliens took tasteless to start the next version of earth where only sexy nerd ballers existed

I'm not really sure. Wheat and Husky come to mind pretty fast.




 **Are there any other games you have interest in casting or being involved with?** 

Kingdom Rush for the iPad. 73/75 stars right now! By the time you read this, as well as Plants vs Zombies.



 **So I sorta have to ask. Artosis pylon

Meh.



**It has been great

Thanks for the interview! Everyone go follow me on twitter. Twitter.com/Artosis








**20 quick questions for Artosis**

**1. Favorite BW unit?**

Vulture

 **2. Favorite SC2 unit?**

Immortal

 **3. Favorite BW player?**

iloveoov

 **4.  Favorite SC2 player?**

Ugh

 **5. Favorite match up?**

 **6. Where do you see esports as a whole in 5 years?**

Even bigger

In my apartment playing Legacy of the Void.


**8. Odds on Legacy of the Void dropping in the next 5 years?** 

Lololol swear I didn't see this before answering 7.


 **9.  Does the bunker need changing?** 
Yes. (no.)

  **10. Favorite thehandsomnerd.com shirt?**

Banenade probably.


 **11. paper

Rock


 **12. Which team on the GSL has the best style?**

TSL

Historically: Soondooboo Chigay. Current: Dwenjang Chigay.


 **15. What do you miss most about living stateside**? 

Sour Pickles.


 **16. Tell us a secret about tasteless.**

1339322517.0,uufsd,Things to be learnt from MLG,Braddowski,10,4,17,"Just a few things that I think MLG needs to build upon in future years about their general eSports coverage.

**NOTE:** This is an *opinion*. If you disagree

* **Know Your Games**

Ok

LoL is a long-running game - it can easily take over an hour. The schedule they'd set for which games would be streamed when led to some streaming channels being empty whilst others were running late. It also led to players not being given adequate set-up time &amp; them pushing on with the schedule whilst there were still technical difficulties.

Meanwhile, instead, there were massive down-time gaps meaning we lost the energy of the tournament. *This* is the game where you should be pushing through competitors - not LoL.

The sad thing is

* **Better Quality Casters**

I would've expected the Fighting &amp; LoL casters to raise these concerns pre-production. Whether they did &amp; weren't listened to, for instance).

Beyond even their pre-production input

There needed to be more LoL casters &amp; possibly more than 2 doing any given game so it takes the pressure off of them for talking constantly for over an hour. The SC2 casters seemed to be better looked after as they had more breaks although this did mean that there were some odd mixes of casters that I didn't think worked. This is an issue with MLGs constantly but they need to match their casters personalities better if they're going to mix-up already established casting teams.

* **Increase the variety of games**

I normally watch SC2 &amp; the one thing I find really dull is when there's a match-up on both streams of a tournament &amp; you know nothing will happen or it's a fore-gone conclusion. This MLG

Having 3 games with different pacing made for an excellent viewing experience &amp; if they fix the scheduling issues, I could move to a completely new game where I have no expectations.

More games with varying pace is not only good for eSports but it's good for the viewer too.

* **Have more intensive rehearsals**

Some of the casters were arriving just the day before the event. There were technical issues with the streams the whole first day. Games would over-run or have massive down-time between them.

The amount of issues there have been for the viewer at home during this MLG could've been fixed by having a few days of rehearsals before the event

* **Better communication**

Some of the players on Twitter, players being kicked out of the players area so they couldn't support their teammates... There needs to be better communication with the players as to what's happening, when &amp; why. If you're not going to allow bathroom breaks between games, say so. If eliminated players aren't allowed in the players area, say so.

Similarly, there'll be a little rage but more people'll be more understanding if they know what's happening.

Prior to that I took over the 1on1 feature

When Carmac and TheSlaSH, and the emphasis was to bring you the person outside of the server/game, their real life more than their gaming career.  I'd already done some long interviews before I took over the feature, so I gradually moulded it into the kind of feature 'Grilled' is now, doing longer interviews and going into great depth about people's careers.
