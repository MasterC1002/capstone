1361751929.0,195t6l,"r/Dexter, not r/Baking",COMBUSTION_MAN,1016,281,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/195t6l/rdexter_not_rbaking/, but I'm pretty tired of bloody cupcakes lowering the standards of this sub. If the word, and I contend that they still don't. It's not original anymore and it's time the fad was wrapped in plastic.

EDIT: Many of you have said that it's the offseason so random stuff should be fine and I should just ignore it. Here's my thing though- It's about quality control more than anything else. I think this self post has been successful enough to indicate a majority. Is it complaining? Yes. But if nothing else, if not resolving.

EDIT 2: Wow, it disappoints me that addressing the quality of a subreddit has been likened to oppression. With posts like this there's always complainception, where people complain about complaining about how complaining is related to the initial complaint. So let's skip that nonsense. Yes, downvoting exists for a reason. But in order to actually change something, it works better to be direct. That's what this is. Anyway, for those who have labeled me a ""whiny bitch"", thank you for contributing to the discussion, however, perhaps you should start there and see how that works out for you.",t5_2rahc

Oh and the icing on the cake?  IT CLEARLY SHOWS A MAJOR FUCKING SPOILER FROM THE END OF THE SEASON OF DEXTER WE'RE ABOUT TO WATCH. Seriously?!?  They took like the last most intense scene from the last episode of the season and forced everyone who pays money for the DVD set to watch it

Shit like this is why people pirate.  I'm never buying another showtime show on DVD again.

I thought I might lay it out for anyone who may have forgotten the extent of how true this is.

Season One:

* She has a relationship with a guy who turns out to be married (Sean the mechanic)
* Falls in love with a the ice truck killer who then tries to murder her

Season Two:

* She meets Gabriel at a gym
* Starts a relationship with Lundy

Season Three:

* Starts a relationship with Anton

Season Four:

* Lundy returns and the sparks fly, Lundy dies

Season Five:

* She starts a relationship with Quinn

Season Six:

* Quinn proposes
* She then realises she is in love with her adoptive brother - goes to confront him

Season Seven:

* Starts seeing Sal Price

Dexter has solidified Doakes as the original. Now Laguerta's only lead is a blood slide at a crime scene

Louis was an intern that stole the Ice Truck Killer files that Masuka can testify for. This also proves he was in the evidence room. He was creating a video game about serial killers. He also hated Dexter which Jamie and a video blog can prove.

The icing on the cake is that he is dead and to never be found which puts Laguerta on a ghost hunt.",self,t5_2rahc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/14odhm/spoilertheory_louis_greene/

Season 1: Family: Dexter going through all his family issues with Harry and Brian Moser. Oh and SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER.

Season 2:  Addiction and devotion: Dexter goes through his addiction to killing and how it feels to discuss it with someone else

Season 3: Friendship: Dexter undergoes the process of making a proper friend, something every human would need, but that doesn't go well.  

Season 4: I could really get this one

Season 5: Another one I'm not so sure about

Season 6: Religion and beliefs: Dexter goes through the normal human process of questioning what is out there. He meets Brother Sam who really gets him thinking. Then again with Harrison's Christian school he wonders what he should pass on to his son. Travis Marshall goes without saying.

Season 7: Love: Dexter (and his Dark Passenger) understand(s) real love upon meeting Hannah McKay; knowing that she isn't drawn to his darkness, like Rita and isn't depending on it, like Lumen. Then again there's the Isaak being gay thing and Debra being attracted to her brother that support the theme of love further.",,False,self,t5_2rahc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/13mxon/season_themes_what_do_you_guys_think/

THIS IS REALLY THE FINAL SEASON OF DEXTER!?!?

There is no sense of impending doom. There is nothing in the air with anything that remotely resembles ""final season of epic show."" It is already episode 6, or Lumen, or fucking Miguel Prado, but its THE FINAL SEASON. For christ's sakes the show is still talking about PROMOTING A SERGEANT for Miami Metro. Do I care? No. Do you care? No. Does it have anything to do with Dexter? Probably not. Not to mention its between Quinn (idiot cop) and random new black chick that just popped up in the final season.

I don't get it. When I get excited for Breaking Bad's upcoming finale I get excited! There is a sense of a clock ticking, Miami Metro promotions, Jamie having sex, Harrison lying about the TV remote, oh and the most important storyline of all; **Masuka's daughter may need some cash.** 

People I have loved Dexter from the beginning and always will. But after being a faithful viewer for 8 years I feel a little betrayed. The writing in Dexter has always been not exactly the best, but the writers aren't that horrible? Right? *....Right?***

- If Early Cuts corresponds with the show universe
- That time in season 1 when he stopped the research of his biodad because it made Deb cry.
- He killed Brian to protect her, taking her instead into his home where she would disorganize his orange juice and take the bed every other night.
- He turned Hannah in to protect her.
- When she found out about him, or try to scare her into not telling anyone.
- He also actually made an effort to go through with Deb Rehab and called her when he felt he was slipping. 
- He was gonna let Deb shoot him. Some people say he was manipulating her

I guess what I'm trying to say is that Vogel is full of shit.

reply to someone but then hardly anyone would see it

##1) What was in the syringe?

Air.

##2) Wouldn't that give him an air embolism and kill him?

No.  That's a cliche for films/TV with evil nurses.

First off

Second

Dexter is an anatomical expert
his neck.  It was subcutaneous (under the skin)

The real reason you try to get air bubbles out is for accuracy in measuring dosage
are dangerous.

##3) What happened to the M99

He didn't even HAVE M99 because he came straight from the play and Travis had stolen his bag with his
supplies.

You also need to handle M99 with gloves and not even spill it on yourself or have it absorb into your skin
through your damp pocket.  The amount of M99 you would want to squirt into your neck is not ""a teensy amount
left over in the syringe/needle""

He also did not shove it all the way through into his mouth and squirt it; it wouldn't reach,000 times as strong as morphine.

##4) Where did he get the syringe

Anyone who NEEDS syringes (e.g. diabetics
needles can easily bend/break when inserting into a stopper (rubber seal on the vial) or flesh
pulled out when withdrawing from the stopper.  One in every N needles is just not glued in right.

This could have been in the glove, or in one of his cargo pants
pockets or his car forensics kit.

##5) How did he fake it to look like there was liquid in the syringe?

With semi-transparent / cloudy plastics
unless you put something directly on the other side of it and can see the magnification effect.

With small plunger stoppers it is easy to think you withdrew liquid when actually nothing came out because of a weak
vacuum seal.


##6) So did he pull the plunger back when he took it out of his pocket to make it look like something was in there?

He took enough time pulling it out that he could have; he used his other hand also
was obscuring it when he held it up so he could have done it at any point.

BUT he wouldn't necessarily have had to -- many syringes come partially un-plungered
You have to push the air out that's already in there.

##7) If he didn't have any M99 with him

He got his bag back after he punched Travis out
syringe when he goes into the field.  He might also keep an extra vial of it dry and reconstitute it because
it has a short shelf-life (~1 day normally).  If he used one of the syringes he prepared for the boat
might have degraded a lot

##8) Where was his bag?

It was either the one Travis carried into the building (or inside that bag)

##9) If it was in his car

Easiest explanation: He took the keys from Travis's pocket and used the key fob to lock/unlock and sound the
horn.

Or

Downtown parking is a bitch so Travis had to park across the street and a block or two away
first explanation the most likely.

##10) If he had extra syringes in his forensics kit

Highly unlikely because even unreconstituted it would degrade very quickly in a hot car.

Etorphine is a Schedule I controlled substance and its hydrochloride salt is Schedule II and only large
animal veterinarians should have it
the car all the time.

Taking a small vial in his kill kit as a backup is more plausible because then he only takes it out of the
fridge overnight and puts it back when he gets home.


##11) Did Dexter plan it out ahead of time?

Unlikely.  He probably thought he could get the drop on Travis and knock him out by hand.

But he's also a creature of habit so he took syringes with him
ALWAYS keeps syringes in his pocket.

(There was also an off-chance he would find his stuff and who knows if the old syringes would be there
undamaged.  If they weren't capped then the needles could easily get damaged with the kit bumping around in
the bag.)

Once he saw he could use it as a bluff
completely solid

They probably went over the logistics of his syringes a zillion times in the first few years with
questions like ""what if he pokes himself in the leg through his pocket?""

If you watch closely he fakes the injection at first, then he had to get JUST the right angle to fake out Travis from a few feet away, NOT get even a little in his neck accidentally, AND he would have had to make an extra trip home to get some even though the eclipse was minutes away, when a brick or pipe would knock him out just as well.

IF he planned out the bluff, it would have seemed really fishy.  Travis was *extremely* suspicious of Dexter and would be tipped off to the trick.  It could have reminded him of the kill kit in the bag, and then he might have made Dexter use one of the leftovers from the boat.


##12) Why didn't he just take the sniper rifle off the dead officer and shoot Travis in the back of the head before he even knew he was there?  Or at least in the but-tocks?

Because when your child's life is on the line
quadruples the chances that both of you are sacrificed to the Sun God with an ancient weapon.

##13) How do you know all this?

I'm a serial killer.


--------

**EDIT** Update:  Official explanation is Dexter brought a syringe full of M99 [but squirted it out surreptitiously](http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/19/dexter-finale-interview/2/)

This means it WAS supposed to be air, so those major points match up.  It also means he either brings extra prepped syringes in his pocket or used ones from his bag kill kit, so that checks out too.

Unfortunately it brings up so many other logistical issues that, which means he walked in RIGHT when Dexter walked out.  How lucky can you get?  And he doesn't even SEE Dexter standing in the doorway 5 feet away, or hear him talking about Gellar's book and the witness with the sword.  Dexter doesn't see him either, and nobody else notices him putting on the mask, including the Nun 4 feet away at the foot of the table, the same one Dexter talks to seconds later in the other room.

Then despite being only *seconds* behind and in hot pursuit, but going to retrieve it changes a hot pursuit and likely beating him there to *instead* gambling on being late not just for an ""appointment"" but his child's execution, and he is already gambling he knows exactly when it will happen and that it won't happen early.  (""Don't worry, I have the full hour!"")

Afterward, despite crews on every tall building around.  Nobody calls building security, not even to order a lockdown or evacuation.  Not a single helicopter is standing by for a rooftop operation or possible car pursuit.  The officer, having secured the roof, does NOT secure the ENTRANCE to the rooftop.  Why not just sit there pointing the gun at the elevator?!  Instead, he's patrolling the perimeter looking for people who can... fly?

**Dexter helping Lumen** - Deb finds out that Dexter is a vigilante who kills other murderers

**Dexter being harassed by Louis** - No reason to keep this a secret. In fact

**Who else knew/knows about Dexter** - No mention of Miguel, Lumen, Trinity's son etc...

**Dexter's interference in investigations** - She saw all the slides. Wouldn't she want to know who he killed

I know that some of this is going to be addressed, and try to ""detox"" him. Deb is a detective; she should be more curious than that.

Let me explain. [I loved the beginning of season 8](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1hzk87/only_2_episodes_in_and_this_season_is_already_one/) 


The show felt sharp and back to it's darker roots. Deb's downward spiral


So now lets talk about where it all went horribly wrong:

**Zack**: I don't think I've ever disliked a supporting character so much on this show. Not even Lila was this bad. Zack is not a likable character. He's a punk. A douchebag. He's not sympathetic


**Ruining Vogel**: Vogel....such an interesting character. She was like Dr. Frankenstein at the beginning of the season. If Harry was The Dark Passenger's father, he's just a boy"". Zack has killed two people now. He doesn't deserve to be alive and his story doesn't deserve to be eating up the final season. Vogel is keeping Zack and consequently his storyline alive, which is really hurting this season.


**Hannah/Miles**: Hannah's back, it should have been focusing more on Dexter himself and the conclusion the show should be working too...but it doesn't even feel like the show is moving towards a conclusion.


**I mean come on, I was hoping it would lead to Dexter's true self being revealed, maybe he would go on the run....SOMETHING, ANYTHING...but now Deb seems to have recovered mostly. This season needed to do something BIG. 

Look at Breaking Bad. The final 8 episodes have started and it feels like the FINAL episodes. There's a sense of ""Wow



I hate being the type of person who just complains.....but damn this season just took a nosedive for me. Last night's episode was my least favorite episode of the entire show's run.",self,t5_2rahc,1376361801.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k92q9/okay_so_i_really_loved_season_8_at_the_beginning/
1376040514.0,1k0mas,Do you know what happened to Doakes in the book? Would you have preferred it? Includes details about one of the creepiest criminals that never made it into the show,twocats,179,38,78,"In Dearly Devoted Dexter I read about the creepiest serial killer I've ever encountered in a fictional work and what he does to his victims beats any other killer from the show by far.

**SPOILERS AHOY!**

In the books

&gt; As Doakes flopped about I could see that his right foot was gone, just above the ankle. He did it very quickly and neatly, placing the severed foot beside Doakes’s head.
 
For a dash of horror

**A TON OF SPOILERS FOR WHOEVER DIDN'T READ and INTENDS TO READ THE BOOKS:**

-----------------

“What have we got?” Deb asked him

The cop shook his head without looking at us and blurted out
again
of a patrol car
the house.

Deborah stared after the cop
really useful or clever to say
The wind rattled the crime-scene tape
yodeling sound that did nothing to increase my affection for the canine species. Deborah
shook her head. “Somebody should shut that fucking dog up
under the yellow tape and started up the walk to the house. I followed. After a few steps I
realized that the dog sound was getting closer; it was in the house
pet. Quite often an animal reacts badly to its owner’s death.

We stopped at the steps and Deborah looked up at the cop

“Coronel. Is this lady a witness?”

The cop didn’t look at us. “Yeah

Deborah frowned. “What’s with that dog?” she asked him.

Coronel made a sort of barking noise halfway between laughing and gagging

“What the fuck is going on here?” she demanded.

Coronel turned his head to look at us. There was no expression at all on his face. “See for yourself, but changed her mind. She looked at me instead and shrugged.

“We might as well take a look, I was anxious to see anything that could create this kind of reaction in Miami cops. Sergeant Doakes might very well prevent me from doing anything of my own, but he couldn’t stop me from admiring someone else’s creativity. After all, it was my job, and shouldn’t we enjoy our work?

Deborah, head in hands. Then she looked back to Coronel and the old lady, then at the front door of the little house. She took a deep breath,
blew it out hard, so I slipped past her and pushed open the door.

The front room of the little house was dark
where the dog was yowling

Animals do not like me, often expressing their opinion in a very pointed way. So I was a little bit reluctant to approach a dog already so obviously upset. But I moved through the doorway, slowly, calling out hopefully, “Nice doggie!” It didn’t really sound like a very nice doggie; it sounded like a brain-damaged pit bull with rabies. But I do try to put a good face on things, even with our canine friends. With a kind and animal-loving expression on my face, I stepped to the swinging door that led to what was obviously the kitchen.

I shrugged, greasy yellow, and the lower half was lined with old, blue pinstriped white tiles. There was a small refrigerator in one corner and a hot plate on the counter. A palmetto bug ran across the counter and dove behind the refrigerator. A sheet of plywood had been nailed across the room’s only window, and there was a single dim lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.

Under the lightbulb was a large, lying in the middle of the table was a . . . um . . .

Well. I assume it had started life as a human being of some kind, left even me a bit startled. Still, in spite of being surprised, I had to admire the thoroughness of the work, and the neatness. It would have made a surgeon very jealous, although it seems likely that very few surgeons would be able to justify this kind of work to an HMO.
I would never have thought, and although I pride myself on my neat work, I could never have done so without damage to the eyes, which in this case were rolling wildly back and forth, unable to close or even blink, always returning to that mirror. Just a hunch, but I guessed that the eyelids had been done last, however, etc. A difficult series of choices, by someone who’d had plenty of practice. 

We often speak of very neat body work as “surgical.” But this was actual surgery. There was no bleeding at all, and the rest of the cuts had already healed, in a way you might hope to find in the very best of hospitals. Everything on the body had been cut off, absolutely everything. There was nothing left of it but a bare and featureless head attached to an unencumbered body. 

I could not imagine how it was possible to do this without killing the thing
coming from Death-head Dexter, and it always ends in death—which I am sure the thing on the table would agree was not such a bad thing.
But this—to do all this so patiently and carefully and leave it alive in front of a mirror . . . I could feel a sense of black wonder drifting up from deep inside

The thing on the table did not appear to register my presence. It just kept making that deranged doggie sound,” she said. “Oh God . . . What is it?” “I don’t know,” I said. “But at least it’s not a dog.” ",,False,self,t5_2rahc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k0mas/do_you_know_what_happened_to_doakes_in_the_book/
