1318355267.0,l8id4,Did Digg make us the dumb? How have reddit comments changed in length and quality since it was formed? Which subreddits are the smartest? Do SDD drives fail as often as traditional drives? Find out all this and more (many graphs inside).,LinuxFreeOrDie,1455,235,279,"Hello TheoryOfReddit! I have gathered data on reddit and reddit's comments for well over a year, swear words

I'll answer my last question first: SSD drives catastrophic failure rate is about the same as traditional hard drives, about a year ago, since I hadn't dumped it into a chart in a while. I had thought about rebuilding all the data, but in the end it was too much work, especially since I'm just not as in to reddit as I was, so my interest has moved on to other projects. What this basically means is I never ended up doing a lot of the comparisons I had planned, and unfortunately can't perform any addition queries if you are curious about anything I didn't cover. So without further adieu: the results.

We'll start with the centerpiece of the show, which as you can see it wasn't. I marked Digg v4 on the graph so we might see if there was a dramatic drop off in quality after we were flooded with Digg refugees, and as you can see, it's pretty apparent that there was not. I should also mention that that line roughly corresponds to the division between the data I got from crawling the homepage every day, compared to digging through old pages. Every data point after that line is based on around 500k comments, whereas the data points before it are based on anywhere from 50k to only 39 comments (3rd data point with the big drop), though usually around 10k. That's why you see some big spikes

Next we'll move on to comment *length*. A big complaint is that we have replaced substantive comments with quick one liners and puns, Digg had little, if any, effect. Reddit's rise in popularity took place well before Digg, and the jump from 50k people to 300k has a much greater effect than 300k to a million it seems.

Now we'll look at the actual content of the comments. I looked at how often certain things appeared in comments, leet, u, lol, lmao, etc, generally the ones I consider ""stupid"", IANAL, insults (bitch, asshole

Real quickly here is a chart for [no capital letter at the start of sentences

This next chart tracks how often various celebrities were mentioned on reddit. It includes [some people reddit loves, stupid reddit! But it didn't really turn out that way. Although Glenn Beck was really mentioned the most, and Beiber was in fact mentioned more often than Tesla usually, it was pretty even, though that's still a little sad to be honest. I'll never understand why people feel the constant need to affirm how much they hate Beiber. It's like they don't understand that music can be targeting towards entirely different demographics than themselves.

So in conclusion, reddit has changed. We have replace longer, more intelligent comments with shorter, more insulting, more slang filled, stupider comments. However, a lot of people claim that we can get around this by simply subscribing to the better subreddits

Again we'll start out with the main attraction, non-joke subreddits. That's hardly a surprise to anyone, as those are widely considered two of the stupidest subreddits. The top also isn't very surprising, with /r/TrueReddit and /r/philosophy taking the cake. And yes, /r/christianity narrowly edges out /r/atheism. It's rather amusing because I got the whole idea to do this from the okcupid blog, where [they compared the grade level of various demographics](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-real-stuff-white-people-like/) (at the bottom). /r/Atheism at the time was bragging about how Christians wrote their profile at a lower reading level, in what remains one of the most pathetic things to brag about of all time. I guess Christianity gets the last laugh on this one.

Now the [length of the comments](http://i.imgur.com/HOTQP.png). The chart looks pretty similar. One thing to note is that you'll see ""DIGG"" on both charts. That's not /r/digg, however after some very strange results (particularly the massive disparity between the two types of grade level), I looked into the comments themselves and about half the comments were the same spam comment, and half of the rest where various other spam comments. It was a bunch of links to fake rolexes or something, which I think wasn't being displayed on the site but was still being returned by the api, so the data was ruined. I never had the time to go back and weed out the spam though so that data is pretty worthless.

One thing that is interesting is that /r/TrueReddit's data almost exactly lines up to the first year of reddit

Onward to [internet slang](http://i.imgur.com/DYK5I.png), but apparently it is not a nice place. I'm a bit surprised /r/android was 2nd place in least insults, though I think that data might look a bit different today since so many posts are about how Apple is the devil, but I felt like that when these numbers were run the first time too, so I guess they keep it classy after all. After that /r/philosophy and /r/truereddit are at the top of the class again.

So in conclusion, as things were already pretty much over at that point. But if you subscribe to the right places, and more importantly unsubscribe from the right places, I don't really think it's much different than it ever was. Oh yeah and always back up your data.

These are just a few off the top of my head. I'm sure there are many I've missed or forgotten. Now, so to speak, and throwing in the proverbial towel. There are several other high-profile users (notably, /u/kleinbl00) who have significantly decreased their reddit activity while not abandoning the site completely. Some of these users have most likely created alternate reddit accounts that they are using instead (in fact, I know with certainty that several have), but one thing I have noticed is that some of these users are active on a site called [Hubski](http://www.hubski.com) - an interesting experiment in social media that appears to combine elements of reddit and twitter. [Here's a link to kleinbl00's ""hub""](http://hubski.com/hub?id=kleinbl00). [Here's a link to Saydrah's.](http://hubski.com/hub?id=Saydrah) [Here's mine.](http://hubski.com/hub?id=syncretic)

I've been browsing Hubski off and on for over a year, however, as reddit continues to grow and the admins seemingly continue to distance themselves from the community (Best of 2012 awards, anyone?). I feel like reddit is on track to become the next Facebook or Youtube, which is great for reddit as a company. Unfortunately, I don't have any interest to be a part of Facebook or Youtube. I use their services to the extent that they are essentially unavoidable, but I don't spend a large amount of my free time on either of those websites.

The biggest difference between Hubski and reddit is that instead of subscribing to subreddits, you can choose a single tag. It can be anything you like, but you are limited to a single tag. After you submit it, and it is viewed &amp; shared by others, other users can suggest a ""[community tag](http://hubski.com/pub?id=42878)"" - which can then, in turn, be voted upon by the community

Another thing that sets Hubski apart from reddit is the ability to create ""hybrid posts"" - you can include a bit of text with every link submission - perhaps a quote from the article, [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/zeq1h/link_text_post_combo/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/9knvm/have_an_optional_text_box_like_all_self_posts/), etc. It also appears that reddit has recently taken a page from Hubski's book - [the icon for gilded comments look strikingly similar to Hubski's badges, introduced almost a year prior.](http://hubski.com/pub?id=48494) Coincidence? Possibly.

I don't know what the reddit admins have up their sleeves, so, /r/TheoryOfReddit, shall we indulge ourselves once again in some good, old fashioned doom &amp; gloom?

I've been a /b/-tard longer than I have been a redditor and my impression of the sites are the following: 
4chan is funny and libidinal
Reddit is self-absorbed yet filled with interesting technical reading. 

Specifically

My feeling is that since 4chan is an anonymous community, but extends into the ability to subvert it. Those that are capable of smartly subverting the sites language are the users that reap the most praise from the community. Furthermore, I think that the sites 'fuck everything' attitude comes from both the anonymity (you don't have to hold yourself responsable for what you say) and from the fact that insults are easier to craft than compliments. 

 This constant subversion and undermining of the site's own language is exactly what makes 4chan chaotic (along with the fact that posts last an average of 40 minutes b4 they 404) and also leads to REALLY great reading. Once you have a little ear-training for the site 1) you start to get the jokes and 2) get to appreciate th wonderful ways the site mutates over time. Furthermore

Keep in mind here that this is all due to the site's anonymity. Reddit, but that does not make sense in this context. funny how we don't have a term for the ability to write stylishly within an ideosyncratic system of communication (I have seen some articles about technical/scientific writing style, but I don't think these are concominant simply because memes can involve pictures n' shit)) is vastly inferior to reddits. I think this is because of two things: 

1) posts persist longer on reddit and therefore the work involved in writing a long, but takes seconds to deploy - therefore the lack of a status accrual is not a problem since within a thread the relational notion of status is re-affirmed as the thread develops). 

2) there exist subreddits. This means that likeminded individuals can find a dedicated location in which to suck each others dicks. On 4chan dick sucking happens too, never being funny, only re-affirming other people's beliefs - which they will of course give you karma for. 

In the end

Let me know what you guys think of this account

tl;dr 

4chan creates conditions where an understanding of the sites in-jokes and tropes are crucial to participating - fostering hyperliteracy - fostering wit. Part of the cost born in this is ephemerality. 

Reddit users can participate without fully understanding its in-jokes and tropes - which means the humor sucks

I was going to write something like *A Reddit-Style History of Racism in America For Redditors*

There's also the fact that people much smarter than me, but that's not really the point. The point is, I'm not sure I'll do the subject justice.

I don't know - a part of this is really important to me because some of these redditors are people out in the world making decisions and interacting with people who don't look like them. I feel a little obligated for my own sake to ""enlighten"" them. It's not like I can avoid them in the real world like I can online.

Today I would like to extend to you a very simple line of thought (and as such this will be light on data). As you may guess from the title of this post, r/atheism... all of these are core subreddits and from their popularity we can see the grip science holds on Redditors' hearts. 

However, relying mostly on pop science and the occasional study that pops up in the media in order to feed their scientific knowledge. This, unfortunately, feeds something I like to call 'The Cult of Reason', after the short-lived institution from the French Revolution. Let's begin.

**The Cultural Perception of the Sciences in Western Society**

To start, peer-review, discussion, theorizing, and above all else: change. Unfortunately, these things don't necessarily show through into our society. Carl Sagan lamented in his book The Demon-Haunted World how scientific education seemed not to be about teaching science, but instead teaching scientific 'facts'. News reports of the latest study brings up how scientists have come to a conclusion, not their formulation. This is, nor does it describe how those conclusions are subject to change.

Redditors

**Redditors and Magic**

Anthropologists see commonly in cultures religious beliefs which can invoke what they call 'magic' or the supernatural. The reason why I call what Redditors have ""The Cult of Reason"" is because when discussing science, and the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 

It is common on Reddit when in debate, they go into (unfounded) talk about how evolution brought about the outcome. This is, of course, common pseudoscience, but I would propose that they are trying to imitate people who do science in order to add to the 'correctness' of their arguments. They can also be agitated is you propose a contrary theory, as if you do not see the 'logic and reason' of their arguments. Make note of this for the next section.

Through this

**Science as a Bestower of Knowledge (Or Science as a Fetish)** 

You'll note that as per the last section (if you listened to me and made note of it), but I see it as part of the cultural perception in society, and as a consequence on Reddit, as a bestower of facts. Discussions of studies leap instantly to the conclusions made, not of the study itself or its methodology or what else the study means. Editorialization is common, with the conclusion given to Redditors in the title of the post so they don't need to think about all the information given or look for the study to find out (as often what's linked is a news article, not the actual study). This, falls under the common perception of science Reddit is used to

You can also see extremes to this. Places like /r/whiterights constantly use statistics in order to justify their racism

All of this appears to point to Redditors seeing Science as something of an all-knowing God bestowing knowledge upon them, as you see in the case of /r/whiterights, in Redditors merely affirming deeply unscientific beliefs to themselves. But I'll leave that for you to think over for yourselves. 

**Conclusion**

Thank you for taking to the time to read my little scrawl. Of course, so feel free to discuss your views of how Redditors handle science in the comments.

Discuss whether users and moderators can (or should) have a significant say in how Reddit can become profitable.  I personally believe it’s in our best interest if we want the site to survive and if we would like to sustain the community.

Wall of details below.  

**DISCLOSURE:**  I’m a long-term redditor and mod with zero interest in reddit outside of my desire to keep the community alive.  In 2006

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Reddit Business History – Follow the Money**

At the end of 2006, Y Combinator and other investors for an undisclosed amount]( http://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/christine-lagorio/alexis-ohanian-reddit-how-i-did-it.html) – ranging anywhere from less than $5 million to [$10-20 million.]( http://betabeat.com/2012/06/how-erik-martin-king-bee-of-reddits-hive-mind-harnessed-the-buzz-clocking-2-5-billion-pageviews-the-site-has-left-the-conde-mothership/)  

Since inception

Reddit has struggled with implementing traditional revenue generating approaches like advertising.  Part of the issue is the reddit community – we simply do not like advertising or promotions.  [Some viral campaigns do well]( http://www.urlesque.com/2010/07/15/old-spice-man-response-videos/) but these do not always bring in revenues.   [The basic advertising program isn’t the best.]( http://blog.crunched.com/results-of-the-crunched-com-reddit-advertising-campaign-fail/)

In mid-2010

&gt;The bottom line is

&gt;Whenever this topic comes up on the site, and how if they wanted to they could hire a thousand engineers and purchase a million dollars worth of heavy iron. But here's the thing: corporations aren't run like charities. They keep separate budgets for each business line, and usually allocate resources proportionate to revenue. And reddit's revenue isn't great. 

[Thus the launch of Reddit Gold – a virtual bake sale that has helped to keep the lights on.]( http://blog.reddit.com/2010/07/it-was-triumph.html)  From a multi-billion dollar corporation perspective that money is cute. Like a puppy.  It’s not enough to make reddit profitable


**Make Reddit Worth $240+ Million

At the end of 2011

Good news is that this type of structuring means reddit is valuable to the parent.  For some reason

Simply put

* Reddit was recapitalized (the original investors were bought out) and ownership was shifted from Condé Nast to the parent company, then Reddit employees get less.

* The site currently has a burn rate of over $7 million per year.  The way Reddit handles advertising and Reddit Gold today does not bring in enough money to cover costs.  

* Mainstream advertisers see reddit as being to ‘bohemian’.  Even those who are good with reddit are concerned about the darker corners of the site.  “As long as we don’t participate in categories of Reddit that raise questions, “we’re safe.”


**Why This Matters to Redditors**

[Reddit managers and board members are struggling to make the site profitable while, but have been trying to find non-traditional ways [like the new redditgifts.com marketplace]( http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/) and Reddit Gold.  

Should we care?  What type of (profitable) changes to Reddit are we willing to accept?  What are we not?  Is it less about the addition of advertising or search revenues and more about *how* these are implemented?

1335035868.0,sllnz,Reddit is not a city-state.,blackstar9000,495,85,148,"You may have seen Yishan Wong's recent AMA. Wong, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4eo4f8?context=1), [city-state is the official party line](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4epsow).

There's an inherent appeal to the analogy, is that it's a bit out of date.

Let's get one thing out of the way right from the start. Reddit is not a democracy. Yes, but if the laws governing broadcasting are still beyond your reach, then it doesn't really make television democratic, now does it? So even if Reddit *is* a city-state, we probably shouldn't think of it in terms of the city-state that most of us think of when we read that word.

(While we're at it, of course, it's just the Athenian connotation.)

There likely was a time when Reddit functioned *more* like a city-state, and no mods. At lot has happened since then, and they've changed the structural reality of the site. As things currently stand, I would say that a more accurate analogy is that **Reddit is a proto-feudalism**.

That may be a little confusing. After all, not least of all because what Reddit offers via subreddits really does approximate more accurately to a system. That's part of the point, and hopefully the importance of that shift will be clear to you as I round out the analogy. Something of the sort was part of the message when the admins of the pre-Wong era emphasized the point that Reddit is less a community than it is [an engine for creating communities](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html). Part of what I'm saying here is that, far from being a unified city-state built out of a network of neighborhoods and enclaves, Reddit is more like a particular political system, a political model that can be stamped on any number of communities, some of which will be deeply inimical to others.

So let's talk a little about feudalism. The basic idea is that there are certain prominent individuals, at least in European feudalism, land, horses and maybe some armor and weapons. That's because the service they usually pledged was military – they were promising to serve as knights to help their new lord protect his material interests. There's a really interesting book on how that system got started in the West, [*Medieval Technology and Social Change*](http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Technology-Social-Change-White/dp/0195002660), but the short answer is: stirrups. That is to say, small technological changes made the social system viable

Something of the sort has been happening over the years here on Reddit. Several structural changes have made those shifts possible, and growth.

So how does the analogy work? Subreddits arise like fiefdoms under the absolute control of its moderators. Redditors who subscribe to a reddit are essentially pledging a sort of low-level fealty to those moderators, commenting, and so forth. The subscriber gets a venue, much the same way that the medieval vassal got land (think of the submit button as a horse); the moderator gets activity for their reddit. And as on a medieval fiefdom, the lord/moderator serves as the court of appeal for the behavior of the vassals.

The analogy is extensible in interesting ways. For example, since future generations could, by and large, by expected to become your vassals. Likewise, on Reddit, 15 or so default reddits have the most ""feudalspace"" in the sense that their subscriberships give them enough activity to occupy a privileged position on the site. That creates a self-perpetuating system whereby they continue to gain more and more vassals, both because new accounts are automatically subscribed to them, even without that advantage

Of course, that structure lends itself to results that make it more and more resemble feudalism. Thus, we end up with a kind of neo-tribalism, as with the beefs between groups like /r/MensRights and /r/TwoXChromosomes, or the general tensions that surround a reddit like SRS.

Even where the relations between reddits don't resolve to outright tribalism, but when it comes time to set up the sort of partnerships that project needs *across subreddit lines*, communal ties rapidly break down. There are virtually no ""city-wide"" projects on Reddit. There are just individual fiefs that can, in most cases, be counted upon to go their own way.

We see the effects also in the more or less unsuccessful attempts to map other analogies onto reddits. Over at /r/RepublicOfReddit, with miniscule turn-outs, and so far no significant differences in the sorts of outcomes is the mods had simply acted unilaterally. The point here is that, even when we try to behave democratically, the structure of the site pushes us back toward feudalism.

And where do the admins stand in all of this? I would say that they're a great deal like the medieval Vatican – an extra-national body that exerts a great deal of influence on the structural level, use that power to organize the [occasional crusade](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html), or to excommunicate [some heretic Albigensians](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/l7mde/the_admins_have_decided_to_shut_down_rjailbait/c2qg3xb), but they remain, in a sense, not city planners, but an extra-national power that acts by shaping the political system

Maybe Mr. Wong and co. would like for Reddit to function more like a city-state. If so, and toward a more full-blown variety.

I mention all of this because I think it's important, rather than as we'd like to see it. Behaving as though Reddit functioned like a city-state is likely to lead us down some wrong avenues unless it's true that Reddit really *does* function that way. Understanding that it doesn't can give us clarity on what needs to happen in order to make it function according to that ideal.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,
1359568091.0,17kliv,Less than half (~48.48%) of Reddit’s most popular links get noticed on their first submission to the site (Academic Paper),aliuy,459,44,33,"**Abstract**

Many online communities ask their members to do work for the good of everyone on the site. On social voting sites like Reddit, however, is underprovision: when too many people rely on others to contribute without doing so themselves. In this paper, we present findings suggesting that widespread underprovision of votes is happening on Reddit, arguably the internet’s largest social voting community. Notably, Reddit overlooked 52% of the most popular links the first time they were submitted. This suggests that many potentially popular links get ignored, jeopardizing the site’s core purpose. We conclude by discussing possible reasons behind it

We all have little things that keep bringing up back to reddit, or a Sisyphean determination to wade through the defaults for the occasional nugget of insight. 

For me, most particularly due to its ability to proudly maintain a host of bewildering quirks:

* Proudly leftist and staunchly pro gay rights

* Priding itself on being attentive to propaganda

* Insisting that Gawker links be banned in the name of free speech

* Furiously waving the flag for Palestinian independence while flippantly rejecting Tibet

* Continuing to repeat a joke at length

Years of carefully studying the hive (I’ll bump up against my fourth anniversary soon) have led me to believe that the quirks which animate its peculiar psychology can be broken down to a number of core concepts, most of which have hitherto been bandied about in various comments and threads, and organize them into a singe integrated document.

**THE CIRCLEJERK**

Far and away, the tendency to circlejerk is not itself a terribly unusual tendency, as any group of people sharing an enthusiastic agreement will inevitably tend towards smug in group congratulation.  What makes reddit’s circlejerking so strange, however, is how whimsical the topics seem to be.  Any casual visitor to reddit is well-versed with its obsession with a strange set of narrow, peculiar interests.  The good folks at circlebroke have documented circlejerks over how [Osama bin Laden wasn’t such a bad guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wdnvr/good_guy_osama_bin_laden/), [two dollar bills](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/), [North Korean propaganda](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wjuf3/reddit_upvotes_obviously_fake_north_korean/)

**SECOND OPTION BIAS**

The seminal post on this topic was made by /u/douglasmacarthur, when discussing the dangers of taking revisionist history too seriously.

**SNOWFLAKING**

But why would second option bias come to be such a defining characteristic of the community?  It is clearly identifiable as a trend, tastes and practices that are intended to separate them from the crowd.  Snowflaking is, of course, not unique to reddit, but it conspicuously manifests itself in various forms:

* The way every thread on music inevitably turns into a “can you name a more obscure artist” contest

* The insistence on belonging to an unfairly persecuted class of people

* The loud rejection of every identifiable aspect of American culture

* The proud ignorance of celebrities (see also:  [Alpha Nerding](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2670))

**JERK ALPHA**

The king of all jerks, is clearly the “I am a misunderstood genius” jerk.  Because this is the jerk which spawns and influences nearly every other jerk the hiveosphere, I refer to it as **Jerk Alpha**.  It is the combination of Jerk Alpha and snowflaking that that yields second-option bias, and its infamous connections with bravery.  You see, it is not quite enough to be a misunderstood genius, the opinions the hiver holds must also be dangerous and unconventional.  For a typical example of these factors all playing out in real time, I refer you to the [reactions the movie Avatar garnered](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/) when it [first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/agbba/sure_avatar_is_pocahontas_in_space_and_a_sequel/)

**THE EMPATHY DEFICIT**

However, we have to examine the peculiar role that **the empathy deficit** plays in the behavior of the hive.  We all remember that the hive erupted in outrage - and rightly so - at the awful bullying behavior of those middle schoolers to that older lady on the bus, right?  It’s interesting to compare that to the hive’s reaction when a bunch of internet porn viewers start bullying a cam girl – all of a sudden [everything is the girl’s fault](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/).  

What’s going on here?  Note how many of these reactions are determined by who the hive happens to identify with more.  Your average hiveminder has very little understanding of what it's like to be black or a woman, probably has some tics that make him noticeably unusual, probably has unusual interests, probably gets picked on. Your average hiver gets this. Hell, your average hiver probably was picked on for being gay, even if he wasn't. He knows what it's like to be mocked for this and it hurts.

Now, bullying crowd or the tearful recipient?  But when the bullying crowd is a group of anonymous keyboard warriors saying dickish things over the internet, how interesting that we suddenly have a whole new set of sympathies.

[A lack of empathy is, the average hiver places maximum priority upon issues with which he can empathize, while disregarding those which involve an unfamiliar form of experience.  The best example of this can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/127bll/truegaming_black_guy_rants_about_what_its_like_to/c6swdc9?context=3), though I also refer you to:

* Jokes about raping men, however, are hilarious.

* Girls walking around in public should have little expectation of privacy

* An abiding concern that [women are out to get us](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10vrkd/a_til_post_about_ladies_night_being_banned_brings/).

Note how the only thing which seems to unify these disparate reactions is whoever the hiver tends to immediately identify with most.

Now, given the hive’s affinity for leftist politics.  Personally, however, I found that comparing [the hive’s relative reaction to Palestine (most important issue!) and Tibet (omg shut up already!) to be quite telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/14of45/if_you_need_any_further_proof_of_the_hollow/), suggesting that what animates the hive is less compassion than the opportunity to take an “unpopular” opinion.  Once again, the prime movers are snowflaking and second-option bias, not bone-bred political convictions.

There is even, one might expect the hive to reject such terms and their hurtful etymology.  Note, however, that there’s no “second option” in this case, no in-law or journalist to contradict.  No one, not even Republicans, argue in favor of the usage of “faggot, because of its quasi-meme status

**CONTENT VS. COMMUNITY**

But what about other quirks, whether in jokes, news or serious minded discussion.  The value of the information is limited to its single use absorption.  Community users, on the other hand, are attracted not just by the raw value of the content but also by the need to connect and integrate with what they take to be a community of friends and pseudo-friends.  Community users will repeat a meme far beyond the point at which its inherent comical value has been bled dry because it functions as a symbol of in-group coherence - think of it as like a digital high-five amongst a cohort of people “in the know.”  This is why in-jokes maintain a life far beyond the value of the original joke, as it functions as a reminder of the group’s unique social cohesion.  This is also why content users roll their eyes with utter incredulity as yet another chain of beaten-down references - the joke has long since lost its inherent comic value, but community users are still banding it around because they are extracting a value from it which content users either don’t want or don’t need.

**CASUAL VS COMMITTED**

The final set of concepts necessary to explicate reddit’s behavior is to understand the distinction between **casual users and committed users.**  This distinction is rather more trivial than the others, reddit clearly caters to casual users, and from a business perspective this makes a certain amount of sense since unique visitors power a website’s cachet.  However, there is a certain danger in this, as the more bland and watered-down the experience becomes, the more it becomes indistinguishable from others, the easier it is to abandon.  The casual users who are driving certain trends in the quality of content are also liable to the be most likely to move onto the next thing.  Despite everything I’ve written here, and what reddit can manage to be

I was contracted to use an existing account to up-vote this - http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qqrl0/this_static_image_shakes_weird/ - this is a link to a facebook blogspam image and deserves no upvotes

so following the user names of the posters i noticed very few have made any other comments
 
 http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nhyvg/strongest_woman_ever/ - almost as suspect quality of replies
  
http://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/qm79t/stop_kony_2012/ - which includes yet more single word positive answers i.e. 'good', this and the shaking eye post I was paid to upvote.  
  
Both the posts which Jaseena upvoted were also upvoted by Mugilavan and posted by the user [compucated](http://www.reddit.com/user/compucated) who has made a handful of posts mostly on the same few subjects;  
   
.. 3 - Eye Shaking Youtube mentioned above  
.. 3 - 'Free Palestine? I'll take two' Facebook joke page   
.. 8 - 'Occupy Palestine' (anti-Zionist joke)   
.. 2 - Stop Kony 2012 -visible-children (which was followed by a post one min later in another thread suggesting the same video)  
.. 5 - 'How Communists Celebrate Valentines Day' facebook joke page  
.. 1 - '■■ Bank Revolution - WHO ARE THE 99%? ■■■ (bankrevolution.com)'   
.. 4 - 'Nickname your Breasts! (Breast Cancer Awareness) (nicknamesforbreasts.com)' in which he's posted two genuine sounding comments.  
.. 4 - 'Tribute to Steve Jobs (1955 - 2011) (tribute2stevejobs.com)' in which he's posted 2 genuine sounding comments (identical)  
.. 2 - 'what the fuck has Sarah Palin Done So Far??? (wtfhassarahpalindonesofar.com)' [anti-palin site]  
..  1 'WTF has OBAMA done so far? (wtfhasobamadonesofar.com)' [a pro-obama site] plus one comment request to pass it on to others
  
So
  
The history of this account seems to be someone that's learning how to push ideas onto Reddit
  
So
  
Has anyone else whored out their upvotes? been tempted to pay your way to the front page?  Do you think this seems like a weird ego thing or a failed attempt at riding the social networking gravy train?  Is someone trying to push their own ideas or simply trying to establish accounts and get followers so as to better push bigger and better paid campaigns?

I've been wanting to make this post for a while, I'll still visit reddit regularly, but I'll refrain from posting in the forseeable future. Feel free to berate me, say ""fuck you!"", and tell me I am what's wrong with reddit. My only response is: ""meh.""

1328066645.0,p5l1c,Some reflections on how reddit has changed on my 5th birthday here,jjrs,378,41,79,"Just to get it out of the way, all things considered. I just realized its my 5th birthday here today

I first came here in late 2006 and made an account early 2007. Reddit didn't have any subreddits yet, and almost no downvotes (this was before ""vote fuzzing""; most top submissions now actually get 5-30k real upvotes). When the admins added the first subreddits and I started seeing subscriber info, there might have been 20,000 subscribers. Basically, it was still very much in the shadow of Digg. But the links were more interesting, and if you submitted a story, it might actually get seen. So I stuck around.

The seed investor Paul Graham and Joel Spolsky had already began to move off, and then finding out he did the comic and thinking ""yeah, that sounds about right"": redditors were mostly self-proclaimed geeks in their mid 20's with some interesting hobbies. 

Then Politics seemed to get more and more dominant, but it got pretty monotone after awhile.

Subreddits, but it took a while for them to catch their individual strides. For a while most of the subreddits outside of r/politics felt like backwaters without much going on (everybody still posted to a generic ""reddit"" subreddit). But of course, that changed. Alexis and Spez (the founders) wanted make-your-own dubreddits because they were fully committed to the self-creating community concept. I believe it was this that allowed reddit to thrive even after they left. Some of the biggest subreddits now are about stuff that never would have occurred to central management.

Eventually, and didn't have as much stake in what other users thought (or at least not much more than what diggers did, if they even bothered reading comments at all). The ""community"" people saw the comments as the main show. They wanted the acceptance of others here. At the time, that was a bit of a novel concept (initially, r/circlejerk started as a bit of a parody of the tearfully happy, ""guys, we're a *community!*"" mindstate).

""Self"" posts became popular before it was even possible to add text; people would just put a message in the link itself. This led to a lot of upvotes of one-liners (""Vote up if you think Bush should go to jail""). The mods hated it because it seemed like reddit would inbreed

The community responded by upvoting self posts more than ever. Today there are enormous self-post subreddits like Askreddit and IAMA that get several times more traffic than the original reddit ever got.

The comment section got better and better. The upvote system saw to it that only the wittiest (or most informed) comments would reach the top, I click the ""submit"" button on my browser just to get lead to the existing reddit thread, where inevitably someone with some expertise on the subject has chimed in to add detail.

People began lobbying for ""comment karma"", not external links.

When McGrim made a post to announce that he had made a free, user-generated content had been frowned on because it was potentially ""blogspam"". Since with imgur you could link to an image with no ads, users could prove they had no ulterior motives posting stuff. It quickly became the site standard, and eventually user-generated content became much more common.

Stuff from 4chan became popular, even if most of the original faces came from elsewhere. Still, a lot of the user-made stuff seemed (and still does) derivative and done for attention.

Eventually the frontpage got full of a lot of stuff that just wasn't very interesting IMO. I unsubscribed from pics, etc and just stuck to stuff like math and philosophy of science and todayIlearned. In my opinion if you filter reddit that way, its as good as ever. But doing that secluded me from the mainstream front page for a long time. I've introduced a lot of friends to reddit, but when we talk about it we often talk about stories the other hasn't seen because its all in different niche subreddits.

Recently, with different communities in every borough. Subreddits like r/trees and r/Ffffuuuu now have more subscribers than the original reddit had, total, and they look, feel and behave completely differently. There's a lot more /self posts (entire subreddits of them, like this one), and a lot more user-generated content and memes. It has its own identity now

The most surprising thing is how influential reddit has became. It blew my mind to see the New York Times take reddit seriously as an agent of internet activism when it covered SOPA. Internet forums always seem to have an inflated sense of importance

In a way

So anyway

Edit: added some more details

Edit 2: People have been asking me if I think reddit is better or worse now. I think there's more of *everything*, more circlejerking..but also more good stuff. 

As examples of good stuff we have now that we didn't have then (for me and my own experience, which now has over 1000 subscribers and got an IAMA...AMA from an editor at Springer. I just found out that an all-girl korean pop group has an active subreddit now. Not my thing personally, but when you find your equivalent infatuation its amazing. That kind of specialization simply wasn't possible on the old reddit. Just not enough people. So in short, anything you want is there, and you'll see whatever you focus on. It just depends on what subreddits you subscribe to and how you filter your experience.",,False,t5_2rtff,True

It's 53 pages long so it'll be a bit of a commitment but there are a lot of screen caps and such which take up some space. My rough draft received an A from my professor but I'd like to hear some feedback from people who are more familiar with Reddit. 

The basic format of the paper is an introduction discussing the rise of participatory media online (Jay Rosen's ""The People Formerly Known as the Audience), framing, and the digital divide. After that I move on to my analysis which looks at the fetishization of science and rationality, political polarization, misogyny, racism, and the potential for positive action. I end with a short conclusion discussing the implications of my study. 

Title: Discursive Communities on Reddit.com's Default Subreddits: Framing Hegemonic Discourse online. 

Abstract:  This paper focuses on the website Reddit.com and how the selection of default subreddits is a framing process by which a distinctive discursive community is formed. The emphasis on science and technology, tech savvy, and politically liberal male contribute to a hegemonic discourse characterized by a fetishization of science and technology as well as tendencies towards racism and misogyny. Despite this, the format of Reddit allows it to be democratic in a way that other media sources cannot, ensuring that it is still overall capable of positive change.

This week's topic:

###What if moderators had the ability to 'turn off' karma in their subreddits?

Karma has been causing problems on reddit for quite some time. Just over five years ago, [the reddit admins removed karma from self posts.](http://www.reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) The blog entry has since been removed, but at the time I remember posts such as ""[Vote up if you love Obama](http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/7b831/vote_up_when_you_officially_voted_for_barack/)"" were regularly on the front page of /r/all. Users were submitting what was then the absolutely lowest common denominator content: a simple self post that most redditors would likely agree with and instinctively upvote. They were farming karma and lowering the quality of the front page at the same time, and the problem had progressed to the point where the admins felt that they had to intervene. It didn't stop the problem entirely, but it did remove the karma incentive.

What if moderators could remove the karma incentive from *all* submissions in their subreddits, removing karma from direct image submissions but allowing it for all other types of link submissions)? Are you a moderator who would use such a feature in your subreddit(s)? Are you a user who thinks such a feature would be beneficial in a subreddit to which you currently subscribe?

Please tell us why you think so!

So, indicting comments being upvoted). However, as I scrolled down further, I didn't see the customary ""You've been linked in SRS"" comment, and after venturing there to check, it turns out that It hadn't even been submitted. SRS was being blamed, even though they weren't there.

It would appear that SRS has become such a boogeyman that simply invoking their name is seen as a ""free pass"" to explain away downvotes. SRS is so universally despised amongst the general population of Reddit (and the defaults especially) that being hated by them has become a sort of badge of honor, this means that people will actively try to troll SRS by posting and upvoting content that draws their attention. SRS continues to do their thing, and since everything SRS hates is now something to be encouraged, this creates an accelerating cycle of bigoted content that is meant to be humorous. At some point, as previously mentioned, it became irrelevant whether they actually take a notice of you or not. Thus, we now have a self-perpetuating, if I may borrow some parlance from SRS.

Normally, the way you ""troll"" SRS is by posting racist, misogynistic, or homophobic content under the guise of ""humor"". For the redditor in-the-know who doesn't find humor in such content, it can be annoying, at best. **But, for an outsider of the same mindset, receiving tons of approval from a bigoted community.** When these people happen to be reporters

Now

1. What do we do about this? The massive increase in popularity of /r/ImGoingToHellForThis might have helped to relegate such content into it's own little corner off the front page

2. Is this something that even needs to be dealt with? Should we worry ourselves with the concerns of such critics?

---------------------------------------------------------

A while back, by no means, a perfect solution to subreddit discovery, it was still a fun exercise in trying to think of ways to help users discover new content on reddit.

Yesterday, and I thought that the ToR community might also have fun doing the same thing.

Not to mention, in my opinion.

Now I'd like to be perfectly clear


* Make a visual design of how YOU would tackle the issue of subreddit discovery
* Optionally document how your design would work
* The design ideally should be something that could exist on reddit - so
* You don't need to actually code anything. You can simple mock something up in Photoshop. But however deep you want to go with this is totally up to you.
* Submissions will be in Contest Mode
* We'll close the contest in about a week (and change from Contest Mode so you can see the results).
* **All parent-level replies in this thread should be contest submissions!** If you'd like to discuss this contest

Everyone who submits a legitimate design will get a free [month of reddit gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about/) just for participating. And whoever's design is the most-upvoted will get 6 months of reddit gold for free.

Again, more than that, I just feel like it'd be fun for some of you guys. That's not to say we won't use some of your ideas in the future, but that's not the goal here.

/r/zelda is a poor subreddit. There's a couple of external factors - huge popularity means a high number of subscribers

So we're faced with a subreddit of fan art and pictures of merchandise. On the rare post that is actually about the game series

We tried two text-only weeks (and we're going to try another next month). The first was good

But yesterday we did day one of a theme week and it transformed the subreddit in hours. **The quality of the posts was very poor** - I encouraged it with the first one, made the top submission and the comments started pouring in. Really interesting comments. Comments that weren't afraid to disagree. Comments that didn't have a minor flaw to pick out.

And then more posts following the same format - we've themed each day of this week on a different broad categories on Skyward Sword - and they're just more screenshots and artwork - but they're actually about the game and they're generating discussion about the games and for the first time in a long

**The comments could still be more intelligent. The post quality is dreadful. But the community is reinvigorated.**

There are problems - it's a LOT of moderation removing posts that didn't fit the theme; there was some minor backlash from people who didn't get the memo (it's been announced since the end of December in the header and sidebar) and eventually the conversation will run out. We plan to do this every other month with a different game - any more and we'd exhaust the topics.

A post on /r/Guildwars2 claimed to have found an in-game crafting recipe which has a high probability of creating a rare item (6/11 times success according to his post). He used this (apparently edited) video to back up his claims: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9VHImqIMYQ

1366916345.0,1d3mvg,Music on Reddit is completely broken,edwardunknown,309,71,110,"Long story short

Other categories: current events, gave me a steady stream of interesting new content (with the exception of visual art, which had it's own problems) but all my attempts to use Reddit to discover new music, or even older interesting music were a waste of time.

I think a few things may be happening: 

* there's a natural sentimental component to the songs people choose to link to–stuff they listened to in college or high school

* people aren't listening to or voting on songs they don't recognize and have already heard

* in larger subreddits

* Reddit as a community simply may not be ideal for curating art of any kind.  My same attempts at scraping Tumblr were far more successful when it came to art and music.  

Before trying this I expected that Reddit would be the best source for crowdsourced music because of it's voting system and diverse categories but it failed miserably.  I thought about expanding it to consider the date the source was posted along with the number of views/likes but because of the overall low quality of the posts I've abandoned Reddit and am using Tumblr for everything arts-related.

I know the definition of good music is subjective so I'm interested in getting other opinions: is Reddit useful for music discovery and if not

Or maybe this provides the template for many more people to karma whore and inevitably force Reddit's hand to improve in order to compete with more evolved competitor sites.  Whatever the case may be

Of late, and a lot of what goes on in the default subreddits spills over into the smaller ones that do not have good moderation.  Reddit as a whole needs to change, and I think that it has the potential to really be the best site on the internet.

**How I got started being a karma whore** - I lurked on digg since 2008 and reddit since the mass digg exodus.  I remember over a year ago when I wrote a long

It was only until recently that I became an active user, I decided to focus on promoting my subreddit and spending as little time as possible to do it.

I decided to transition to the more visible username r_HOWTONOTGIVEAFUCK and pretty much mastered the game (not trying to be pompous here).  During this period about 90% of my comments were posted during the hours of 9-5 on weekdays (when I work).  In 3 weeks

Now at this point I don't see much purpose to posting in bulk.  For a short while it was pretty cool to be a ""celebrity"" and have other redditors recognize me by name.  But the thrill of this dies quickly.  And rather than acquiring worthless karma points

So you probably won't see me as much in the default subs any longer.  I may show up every now and then, /r/DepthHub, and also the community oriented ones like the reddit exchanges.

**I submit Comment Karmawhoring 101 - Guide to racking up worthless internet points**

1. Try to stay in the large subreddits, and /r/AskReddit - These subreddits have a lot of subscribers, lots of upvotes, and lots of new posts that are available for commenting.  Other large subreddits such as /r/politics or /r/science are also an option, but sometimes commenters are looking for more of an in depth and insightful response.  They also don't have nearly as many posts as /r/pics or /r/funny. 

2. Go to your subreddit of preference and stay in the what's hot page - Scroll down the page until you see [a post without a score](http://imgur.com/D2Uws).  This means the post is fresh (within 2 hours)

3. Commenting on a post rarely works, you can be pretty sure 2nd comment will eventually hit the top.  Reply to 2nd comment.

4. Continue the conversation - Continue the train of thought from the preceding comment.  Also, you do not have time to think out the perfect response.  If you try to think too hard, it will probably be a bad comment.

5. The comment MUST fall under one of these categories - witty/funny, expresses gratitude towards someone or something.  Keep in mind, witty/funny works the best, by far.

6. Understand the Reddit audience - They are left-wing idealists for the most part.  Don't criticize their beliefs.  Inside jokes work extremely well.  Always stay positive and if you must criticize

7. Keep your comment short - Everyone who enters the comment section is willing to read a 1 liner

8. Use bold or ALL CAPS.  If you know you have a gold comment, you will be downvoted strongly.

9. Use an image or GIF to explain what you can in words - **Reddit prefers looking at pictures over reading.**  This is probably the most important tip I can give you.  **NOTE**: Meme's work well also

10. How do you find a gif or image? - Easy. Think of a keyword that matches the comment you are responding to and do a quick search on /r/reactiongifs or /r/gifs. [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/tumjj/dont_bring_a_girl_to_the_nba_finals_shell_just/c4pvb8d?context=3).
**PROTIP**: Reaction gifs are gold.  Keep a list or folder for quick

11. 2nd option - Find an image using [google images](http://images.google.com/).  Just type in the keyword that matches the comment you are responding to and add ""funny"" to the end.  You will most likely find something that redditors will gladly upvote. Example [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tqmin/adult_swim_just_announced_that_toonami_is/c4owd7z?context=3) (Search google images for ""samurai jack funny"" and look at page 2 for exact image I used)

12. Look for opportunities to respond to people who have replied to you.  Karma trains are your friend.  Ride them till the end.  **NOTE**: If someone criticizes your posts

13. Something I never did but works for a lot of other redditors ([I won't mention names](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8p92/i_emailed_a_teacher_to_say_thank_you_and_he/c4khzug?context=3)) - Exaggerate or completely make up anything related to you - personal anecdotes

uneditreddit is a browser plugin that allows you to see deleted comments. it's gotten some [uptake recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/16ltra/ysk_about_unedditreddit_a_site_that_allows_you_to/)

these abstract concerns aside, its data assembled by uploading and redistributing the comments seen by its users. this gives it an ability the centralized version never had: peeking into the private subreddits frequented by its users. additionally, reddit itself has far fewer options in addressing this kind of approach, which does not directly obtain any information from reddit servers.

of course, citing controversy. debatably, by failing to respect these concerns, unedditreddit should be seen as suspect. less debatably, **unedditreddit betrays a certain level of ideological involvement by using [a screenshot of /r/SRSWomen on their download page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unedditreddit/ppgcnpiddlbiemncalhbpgkcgecfofpj)** ; see today's [SRSMeta discussion here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/18c7l3/is_unedditreddit_safe_to_use/).

personally i think this makes it reasonable to conclude that **unedditreddit is probably maybe being used to obtain surreptitious access to private subs**

it bears noting that private subs aren't exactly super secure things to begin with and this particular 'risk' should be weighed with due consideration that private subs are less *super sekret clubs* than they are bargain-basement spit-guards against the hoi polloi.

Lately I've gotten a lot of reports about comments

My suspicion is that ToR is attracting trolls by making bogeys out of groups it would do just as well to ignore. We get entirely too many posts about SRS, quite honestly, doesn't haven't any effect on the vast majority of users.

And in case anyone missed it, I consider that case closed. Yet ToR continues to talk as though it were clear that there wouldn't have been a policy change without the SA campaign.

A lot of this drama could be avoided if ToR contributors would stay focused on [constructive discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/p9c0m/a_mild_corrective/). There's some room to talk about the possible side-effects of the policy change, to my mind, justify the dozen or so threads we've gotten on that topic in the past 48 hours.

So, I could ban those, too. I could ban new accounts every day, and I wouldn't even mind that if I thought it would ultimately make a difference.

The catch is: I don't think that. I'm convinced that actual trolls are only part of the problem. The other part -- the part that's going to continue to attract this sort of behavior -- is this community's eagerness to assign blame. If it isn't SomethingAwful, it's ex-Diggers. Or Facebook. Or high school kids, or newbs in general, or whomever you think represents the lowest common denominator.

Take a look back at some of [my submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/search?q=author%3Ablackstar9000&amp;restrict_sr=on). You'll find that a lot of them are about structural features of Reddit that we have to acknowledge and account for if we want to make constructive changes.

A few days ago, /r/circlebroke, and /r/self.

The survey was not intended to decipher a representitive opinion from any particular subreddit's users. It was designed to explore a couple of specific things

The full results are [public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AngLTjeGcV-WdDRvNnZMZ3FiSmdxWVZqWUVDd1UtRnc)

* Composition of the 6

* Coded/grouped ""self-identify"" free text (the third question of the survey). The groups are usually the literal response that was given, and not if they also listed a denomination. Responses coded as ""Other"" have five or fewer responses. Here are the top 10 responses for those who answered the question ""Do you believe in a God or deity"" with [NO](http://i.imgur.com/YmC2l.png), with [YES](http://i.imgur.com/tUiTL.png), and with [I DON'T KNOW](http://i.imgur.com/gNtE3.png).

* [Response](http://i.imgur.com/Fymm0.png) to the question ""Do you believe in a God or deity"" broken down by level of agreement with the statement ""I can't stand /r/atheism"". Of those who *completely agreed* with the statement

Below are some slices of the responses, on a metric defined by ""Completely Disagree"" = -2, ""Mostly Disagree"" = -1, ... ""Completely Agree"" = 2.

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/Syz6Z.png) for people who agree (mostly or completely) with ""I can't stand r/atheism.""

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/G6PA1.png) for people who agree (mostly or completely) with ""I love r/atheism.""

* [All responses](http://i.imgur.com/of04r.png) for people who answered ""Yes"" to ""I believe in a God or deity.""

1345658537.0,yndbc,Reverse Engineering reddit trophies part 1: Bellwether,solidwhetstone,259,44,59,"http://static.reddit.com/award/bellwether-40.png

**Description:** ""Hang out on the new queue and flag carefully""

**What it really means:** Each day, and upvoting submissions that go to the front page of that subreddit, he becomes more likely to win this award. Since only one is awarded each day, a very high amount of accuracy is required.

**How to achieve this trophy:** I interviewed /u/Quarter_Centenarian about this since he has won bellwether a total of 31 times. Here is the information he gave me:

&gt; When I'm in /new, I probably upvote more stuff in smaller subreddits in an average day just because I know they're more likely to gather attention from their niche crowds. Also remember that downvotes affect your chances of winning too, so if something is just awful, be sure to be the first person to downvote it into oblivion, but don't be wrong! I think I've lost a few times from misjudging a submission that actually went on to be successful. I browse /new in spurts, but I probably honestly average about 10-14 hours a day in it. I spend way too much time on reddit honestly, but it's fun to see the frontpage with all purple links from content I've already seen. Just lots of time, and lots of patience.

&gt; I always upvote things in big and small subreddits. I originally tried winning it by upvoting only things in big subreddits,000 subscribers, a good amount of &lt;30,000, a handful of &lt;10,000), and bam, and go on a 15 minute draught of nothing but crap), I went back and checked to see how they did). I'm not sure if it absolutely guarantees you won't win

1340238287.0,vcu9x,Let's talk about drama.,,270,64,207,"We've seen a massive increase of new users in the last three months, and above all to encourage civil and rational discourse at all times. We try to downvote based on the relevancy to the discussion at hand, larger subreddits come into our little playground with their friends

How many new users,000 users. Today it has 16,143, which is an increase of more than 60%, and if my experience creating and moderating subreddits has taught me anything, it's that this growth is only going to continue. Not only will it continue, but it will continue at an increasingly accelerated pace as time goes on. What that means is that in the near future, new users will make up the majority of our userbase. Because of that fact

As our subreddit increases in size, invades and massively derails one of our submissions, it throws everything out of balance. If the submission contains drama, a ""villain"" is usually identified and is downvoted mercilessly. Irrelevant jokes are upvoted to the top, and off-topic comments outnumber the on-topic ones. Due to the extra attention from a larger community, the submission is usually upvoted into triple digits or more. To new users, who as I mentioned above, it appears to be business as usual for /r/TheoryOfReddit. What's worse

Case in point, but every comment that *spoke favorably* of the OP as well. One of our moderators spent more than four hours [handing out warnings](http://i.imgur.com/ihs4T.png) for personal attacks &amp; abusive language, to little avail. The tide of new comments did not stop. It only continued to grow as more subreddits picked up the scent, including /r/SubredditDrama. When the moderation team discussed this issue, we decided we had several options when dealing with ""raids"" from other subreddits:

1. Ignore the problem completely and hope it goes away on its own.
* Remove off-topic comments a la /r/AskScience in any thread that is being invaded from another subreddit.
* Remove the thread entirely
* Remove the thread, in my opinion. No one from an outside community will comment or vote in ToR after the thread has been whitewashed, they will resort to screenshots and stay contained in their own subreddit. New users coming into the subreddit after it has been whitewashed will have no idea what's going on, become bored, and leave.

I didn't think the first option was viable at all. I'm not in the habit of ignoring problems in my subreddits.

The second option was something we discussed at length, and in a timely manner, would require increasing our moderation team many times over.

The third is something that I've done in the past

Ultimately we made a decision. If we have to receive hundreds of new subscribers during a raid or a witch hunt

&gt;Witch hunts and subreddit raids will not be tolerated here. When another subreddit links to, that thread will be removed by a moderator and deleted. This stops the raid immediately.

I waited a few days to discuss the issue to make sure that we were no longer the focus of attention from /r/bestof, to be posted to /r/TheoryOfModeration after the thread has been whitewashed. Any help in that area would be greatly appreciated. If I could simply lock the thread and remove it, that would be preferable, but unfortunately that is not an option we have as reddit moderators. As usual, we are forced to resort to [crude hacks](/r/TheoryOfModeration) instead of the proper tools we need to moderate effectively. However, that's a discussion for /r/IdeasForTheAdmins, and no amount of complaining in this subreddit will help the matter ;)

I'd also like to announce that we are looking for a few new moderators. I would like to recruit users who have a history of activity in the subreddit, giving a clearer purpose to the subreddit and decreasing the risk of confusing new users about what type of discussion is appropriate. More mods also means more voices and opinions when it comes to policy discussion, and that is always a good thing. If you're interested, please leave a comment in this thread, rather than contacting the moderators privately.

The floor is open to any questions

It is a select few individuals who I have seen gather through that site.**

So I work in paid search and use a multitude of websites to keep up to date. One of which is one that I use frequently because it has a lot of skilled individuals who keep up to date and because it's pretty interesting to see what SEO changes are going down.

Like any community thought they have their dark sides and one thing in particular they are interested in is gaming Reddit for traffic. You also have people making scripts and passing them around for [LINK REMOVED].

There's also the IRC channel that is used [REMOVED] which I've sat in before but I've missed out on anything exciting.

It's interesting to see that PIA (A VPN service that I use as does a lot of Redditors seeing as they give you a discount if you use the Reddit related code: reddit15 and is top of /r/vpn) is the VPN of choice as it would help make accounts blend better.  

It's also interesting to know that it's not just the element of gaming Reddit but ensuring that there's no chance your competitors can either.

I must admit this being a sad day. Nothing explicitly to do with theory, which facilitated a similar reaction. Though I don't know if it caused such a huge reaction as this or not. However, in the first hour since the announcement Reddit crashed only once for me - whereas we all remember what happened when Osama died.

What you find is a rush throughout all major subreddits (but also circlejerk) to get the news out. Submissions which are even a few moments late are generally downvoted

[This was the next

In the 9th minute (from time of announcement) there were 47 submissions on the subject - meaning a post every 1.2 seconds on average. Quite incredible.

So far the admins have consistently ignored those suggestions. That has, I'd say, shaped them for the better – or, at least, in interesting ways.

For starters, and account descriptions to provide pre-fab personalities for our interactions, any personality that we hope to emerge has to arise out of discussion.

The only caveat is that the ability to name your account provides one opportunity for front-loading personality. The most obvious outgrowth of that is the evolution of the novelty account. But even there

There's another effect of our lack of profile, if not more so, and it's that effect that started me thinking about this in the first place. Given the lack of profile involved in our accounts, flair becomes a more crucial means of distinguishing accounts from one another. It's one of the few automated means of making an account stand out from the rest. For that reason, it will tend to exert a high degree of appeal for users who want to be distinguished.

More significantly, flair differs in that it allows us to specify qualitative differences, rather than just a quantitative difference. When you see a person with abnormally high karma, you don't know whether they got that for consistently making fantastic discoveries, or for simply playing the repost game really well. Flair, on the other hand, can be used to append descriptions to an account

That's something of which mods should take more note. It allows them to offer flair as an incentive for helping to shape a sub.

* Good places to eat in Seattle

We have other resources on the sidebar as well, why are there a bunch of firetrucks at this intersection?"" posts).

The problem with the rise of mobile is that **users no longer see the sidebar before they make a post**.  This means that we've seen a big rise in posts that the community is annoyed with; ""Moving to Seattle, what should I do while there?"" - these posts are seen multiple times in a single day.  This causes the regulars who subscribe to /r/Seattle to react in a couple of ways: they berate new users who don't know any better and/or they downvote the submissions.

It is possible to see the sidebar on Reddit Is Fun and Alien Blue

This frustration causes new users to feel /r/Seattle is an unfriendlier place than it would otherwise be - ""My innocent post asking about moving to Seattle got down voted into oblivion

My thinking on how to address this is to require all users, require mods to define a set of questions that demonstrate reading comprehension of the ""pre-post text block""; the user could be asked something like, ""What is the topic of first link in the block of text above?"" - with the answer being something like, ""Moving to Seattle FAQ"".

They are both right but they basically compare apples and oranges because of the same reason: they are both right and they don't directly clash on argumentation.

One could claim /top of subreddits is that database. But that's erroneous because if you try to do that right now, weeks, without finding it hard to follow the sheer volume of articles. And the blanket choices already existing (last year's articles, etc.) do not offer a wide range of choices, especially in limited amount of upvotes and time period.

What is needed is a database that can be referenced easily. For example:

Enter:

Period of time (From Date - To Date)

Subreddit(s)

Minimum amount of upvotes

Maximum amount of upvotes

And perhaps more.


That way people will not be able to say ""I didn't see it"". Because people would then say ""Use the good database search feature"".

Also

Perhaps a better tagging system would help it. For example ""Articles of this tv show that refer to that character"". Or one could use the tagging ([stackexchange](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/) comes to mind) that is already going on in subreddits like /r/science but with the refinement of a more complex system that can of course generate directly URLs so one could find it easy to use one-click searches for historical reference subreddits.",,t5_2rtff,1358246032.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/16m12w/maybe_reposting_is_not_the_problem_per_se_but_the/

I'm a mod in many NSFW subreddits and

***

### The Problem

Spam makes for a bad user experience and brings down the quality of reddit. Spammers on reddit use throwaway accounts, and clever tactics to evade reddit's internal spam filter.

***

### Existing Solutions

1. **ReportTheSpammers**

 /r/ReportTheSpammers (RTS) was a nice idea but it cannot scale to the amount of spam on reddit. It's practically impossible to submit a post for every account created by every spammer. And not every submission is guaranteed to shadowban the spammer. RTS iffy

2. **AutoModerator**

  u/Deimorz has been more than helpful with configuring /u/AutoModerator for removing spam. There are some limitations to AutoMod

 * Limitations:

	* Require**d** human intervention to add the spam filter. Sending a PM to Deimorz to add a new filter takes time

	* Deimorz recently allowed mods to alter AutoMod's config by editing a Wiki page inside of the subreddit. Read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator/wiki/Wiki-Configuration). But even with this new feature...

	* ...Spam filters are on a per-subreddit basis. I'm only allowed to add filters in subreddits I moderate; it's up to the admins to decide if a domain belongs in reddit's internal spam filter. And I can't be bothered to update 145 wiki pages across 145 subreddits. Deimorz has mentioned a feature for subreddits to ""inherit"" filters but this feature is not live AFAIK.

	* AutoMod was slow at removing spam - removals were delayed up to 10 minutes. 

	 * Deimorz has since addressed this issue and AutoMod now removes spam within 10 seconds on average.

	* AutoMod can't detect comments/posts that are edited to include spam; it looks at each comment only once.

	* New filters added to AutoMod will not be applied to existing comments and posts.

***

### A New Solution

With RTS and AutoMod lacking

 * Remove**d** spam faster than AutoMod. 

 * Detects posts that are edited to include spam. 

 * Applies new filters to the 500 most-recent posts and comments. 

	 This was great since I no longer had to bug Deimorz to add filters *and* it picked up some of AutoMod's slack. 

I added the bot to the subreddits I moderate in. /u/asstits pushed to get other NSFW subreddits to adopt the bot.

***

### Crowdsourcing

Managing the spam filters on my own was wearing me thin.

I created a website which allows ""trusted users"" to add spam filters to the bot without my intervention. The number of trusted users is enough to count on one hand. These are users I've known to be firmly anti-spam for many months and have proven their seriousness to the cause.

Pros:

 * Instant gratification - filters are applied immediately.

 * ""Scores"" - People like statistics and it's nice to see how much of an impact you're making.

 * The scoreboard turns the spam problem into a ""game"" which encourages trusted users to add rising spam domains to the filter.

Cons:

 * Human error &amp; trolls. A trusted user could add `imgur`

  * Careful selection of trustworthy users is the most important factor in this issue.

 * The public log ensures that other trusted users do not add questionable or irrelevant filters. All trusted users have the ability to remove filters created by other users.

 * Publicly displaying the filter lets the spammers know when they've been caught.

Note: We will assume the spammers don't frequent ToR and have to rely on security through obscurity.

***

### Results

The bot went public about a few months ago. So far the bot has removed around 15

The bot currently has ~800 spam filters that have been added by trusted users. I could never imagine sending 800 filters to Deimorz or adding 800 filters to a wiki.

The bot also has custom filters for detecting different types of spam that couldn't be parsed in a wiki (or would be difficult).

### Conclusion

Automating simple processes like detecting &amp; removing spam has been the key to keeping spammers out of reddit &amp; keeping relevant content flowing. As spam evolves,True,,t5_2rtff,False,,,t3_1j2t36
1364239658.0,1azowe,I'm always fascinated by the concept of the reddit comment whose karma score is significantly greater than that of its parent. Has this been discussed here before? [x-post from a(n) /r/firstworldanarchists post's comment],,245,52,41,"There's always something unique and tangible about this kind of comment--something that truly, awesome

Of course, but also make sure to round up the context for each of them too. If I had the time, I'd love to research and figure out how to make a script that does this--

     search through reddit comment DB
     collect all comments X with significant positive karma discrepancy between theirs and their parent's
     for all such X
         all direct comment ancestors as a reply line
         the original post the resulting root comment replied to
         the subreddit this original post was posted to

As a programmer

Oh also, not because the child comment is really all that outstanding at all. That would definitely have to be checked for in the results if we ever got anything up and running.

EDIT: As /u/ThatsNotMyPenis pointed out, as people visit it, agree it's a great comment, and upvote it, without even looking at all at its parent comment. While it's a great comment that would cause this in the first place, it's not really a natural creation of the kind of ""outstanding"" comment we're talking about.

EDIT: Here's how I'd solve the problem of low-scoring parents: have the option to include or not include relatively high-scoring comments whose parents are extremely low-scoring.

As there is a definite slow but constant decline of comment karma as you descend a comment tree from its root

     +215 karma, +2000 karma

as opposed to just a flame war situation:

     +18 karma, -10 karma, +20 karma

EDIT 2: I'm seeing a lot of well-founded fears about this kind of thing actually changing how reddit users operate if it were to be implemented in Reddit or RES (something I didn't even consider as a possibility). I think they're absolutely right--this shouldn't be added there for all to use

An idea to make sure this all can be avoided in the first place is if we made this only search through posts that have already been **archived**--the ones that report ""sorry, but 6-month ago reddit is still reddit, and it still has a lot we can learn from

Another possible positive for only searching through archived posts and comments this is that, unaltered, voting results, as they can't be edited anymore anyways.

Often I'd see neat things on reddit and then some time later I would remember it and try to find it again and Google would be nearly useless

For example

I've been thinking about moving from Spotify to Google Music. I remember seeing this tool posted on reddit that transfers your playlists. So I Google a bit and I find out it is called Portify. So I search: 

    portify reddit
The first result is a [blog post](http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/06/10/open-source-tool-moves-spotify-playlists-to-google-music-using-unofficial-apis/) which rips it's content straight from the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1g0w0x/export_spotify_playlists_to) I'm after. Despite actually including reddit as a keyword and top result linking directly to the thread I want, the most popular thread about it is nowhere to be found.

By no means does this excuse my behavior, I had watched her die in a hospital bed. I was extremely stressed out, I acted rashly, and I apologize. As a result, we now have a new policy regarding bans.

Rule five stands as it is now. I feel very passionately about that rule, any violation of rule five will result in a warning. Subsequent violations will result in a second and third warning. After three warnings, a temporary (two week) ban will be put into place while the entire moderation team reviews the situation and decides if the ban should be temporary or permanent.

&gt; My goals were to consolidate all the speculative images and ""who did it"" posts into one subreddit (they were all over other subreddits), of course, pretty naive — as pretty much every post made it to Facebook, Twitter, and even mainstream media.

What I want to suggest here is that a major part of the problem here was a fundamental mismatch between oops777's goals and what Reddit is actually built to achieve.

When I first created this account, I've seen a greater and greater emphasis on community and conversation, with numerous people saying that they joined because they had been attracted by the relatively high standard of discussion on the site. Today, user-created content dominates the front page, and self-post-only subreddits represent a significant proportion of the default set.

There has been, similar to a BBS or the comment threads of blog. In light of that perception, it was natural that oops777 would think it feasible to structure a crowd-sourcing sub as a sort of discussion board.

Design matters, therefore, even more natural that what was posted in /r\/findbostonbombers would rise to the top and spread therefrom. That, after all, is the functionality for which the site was initially built—to take contributions, subject them to a vote, and display the results to as many people as possible. Any other functionality it might provide is secondary to that basic design principle.

The point is this: Many of us enjoy slightly breaking the functionality of Reddit in order to make it do things for which it was not designed. Often, we do well to remind ourselves that Reddit functions first and foremost as an ""attention aggregator,"" and that the safest thing to do with information we don't want aggregated and popularized is to keep it off of Reddit in the first place.",,False,,t5_2rtff,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1cy95r/how_we_use_reddit_v_how_reddit_uses_us/

&gt; ""I am part of an advertising company. My team has manufactured numerous front page posts over the past 2 years. Already, or a submission that starts with ""Look who I found when I went to see the DKR this weekend!"". We are also allowed to screen the film early to pick out plot points that would be ripe for a ""Scumbag Batman"" or ""Scumbag Bane"" type meme, so we can plop those up immediately following the films release.

&gt; In order to do this, gaining karma steadily, so it's not rejected by the community when ""they"" submit their advertising. Sometimes I think this contributes to the banality of this website.

&gt; Your website is already being ""exploited""

&gt; Edit: Since people are showing interest, where it appears that the person who took the photo is on a plane sneaking out an iphone style picture of a flight attendant playing a 3DS on some down time over the flight, behind a half closed curtain where they usually sit. There really are low to mid budget ""photo shoots"" where the output is a kind of blurry iphone picture, it actually makes me laugh sometimes. Maybe if a certain airline was willing to throw some cash our way, the title could be something like ""Delta picks the best stewardesses"" or something ironic and that would attract upvotes in a moment of ""Oh I get the joke!"" (theres a whole psychology of getting upvotes). This isn't something that was actually shot, but it's the kind of stuff we conceptually storyboard.

Surely Reddit should be doing more to fix this? Not to mention

But then there's also the fact that even on subreddits like /r/foreveralone, they're all fashioning themselves as ""forever alone"", so why hasn't it crossed their mind that perhaps what they should do is befriend some of the other users?

I'd also add that I think it's an absolute tragedy that this is all the case.

I encourage you to dig through the data that I will post if you want to see how subreddits are connected. I also saw /u/kjoneslol's post about tracking sidebar views. Very awesome timing I think.

# The Crawling

I created a program using C# using [Html Agility Pack](http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) for parsing the webpages. The crawlers would go to a page

Then

I plan on releasing my program on a later date.

# The Results

[Here are some visualizations of my results](http://imgur.com/a/drwDV). This was done with Gephi 0.8.2.

[Pre-formatting/cleaning File ""result.gv""](http://www.mediafire.com/?9m4km7d6z7sjnna)

[Post-formatting/cleaning File ""result_cleaned.gv""](http://www.mediafire.com/?lq476c9ssygqf19)

# Conclusions

I call this the Surface of Reddit because it's what can be easily found by users just by clicking sidebar links. It consists of approximately ~~5.4k~~ 29

[Metareddit tracks over 238k subreddits](http://metareddit.com/reddits/).

So my scraping barely scrapes the surface of what Reddit consists of, the Fempire, and nsfw subs.

I'm guessing there are a lot of failed subs (started with a dozen subscribers with little/no activity) in that mix

BUT, even more than previously believed. My new sub has doubled its subscriber count after being linked on the sidebar of a popular subreddit.

# Future

I think I'm going to start looking at metareddit and see if I can find what subreddits aren't found on the surface and what they discuss. I also think that sorting the data would be a great future project. When I post the .gv (need a few hours to take care of personal stuff first) then I suggest you join me with digging in.

We also should look at charting activity on surface subs and non-surface subs for comparison.

Thanks for reading folks!

# EDITS

- I have formatted the data and looked for errors. Apparently the regex I used to find subreddit names forgot to exclude query strings or anchors. So

- The subreddit count might be off. I re-opened the .gv and it gave me 7.4k nodes. I'll have to create a program to sort the data to find just exactly how many subs I discovered.

**::EDIT::** Totally forgot to include the announcement post: http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/12yexe/new_big_rule_change_in_rcars_please_read/

The gist of it is:

* Our community has grown from 12
* Community had essentially become an image board with imgur links dominating the front page
* We eventually decided to implement a [spotted] tag rule. If you posted a picture of a car you saw out in the wild somewhere you had to include that tag. 
* Even with that tag
* Images without context also dominated the front page. These included images clearly taken from a Google image search.

We decided to ban all links to imgur and links to direct images. But self posts containing images are still allowed.

We truly believe this will improve the quality of the subreddit. We have a couple vocal users who say we're ""killing"" the subreddit but of course we think that's not the case.

When I first visited the subreddit, except for when it is a serious subreddit to celebrate freedom,"" but I always interpreted that as a joke. Regardless, as the subreddit gains more popularity and visibility in /r/all, a growing number of posts seem more serious and less satirical.

What is the reason for this change? Were patriotic Americans stumbling across the pictures and memes and mistaking them to be serious? Do some people just suck at satire? Or is there some sort of effect from being exposed to the same joke over a period of time. In other words

I noticed something similar in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis. It seemed like making jokes at the expense of minority groups led to an increase in racism and legitimate hostility in the comments. I figured it was just becoming a place where racist people could gather while others made insensitive topical jokes (wow, but after watching /r/MURICA grow more patriotic I'm starting to wonder if joking about something actually has an effect on the way people think about it.

1350066060.0,11dkzx,Study suggests 1/9/90 or 1% rule may no longer apply: analysis and discussion,creesch,193,23,39,"According to [research done by the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/05/bbc_online_briefing_spring_201_1.html) the [**1/9/90 rule \(or 1% rule\)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_\(Internet_culture\)) often cited in this sub and the rest of Reddit might be outmoded. Since this rule is often used to explain certain tendencies and behavioral aspects of users on Reddit I thought it is something worth looking into.

**Summary of the research**   
Since most of the information is in a video lecture I thought it would be convenient to provide a summary since the website itself did choose to only highlight a few aspects from the video. A pdf with visual data used during the video can be found [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/05/bbc_online_briefing_spring2012_participation.pdf).

*- Methodology*    
The Participation Choice is a synthesis of primary and secondary research conducted over the past 18 months. The data published are all taken from a recent

*- Definition of digital participation*    
De definition used for digital participation in this research: Creating and contributing so others can see 

*- 77% of the online audience is active in some way*     
Reasons given for this rise compared to the 2006 10% (the 1% and 9% combined): 

* Higher internet penetration (for the UK: 76% compared to 60% in 2006)
* Multiple devices (smartphone usage
* Rise of products that make participation easier (Think facebook, etc) 
* Changing cultural norms (Digital participation is now seen as normal

This 77% can be divided further resulting in the following: 

* 17% Intense participation: Highly active in range and number of activities they do. The activities they lean to also require more effort
* 60% Easy participation: The biggest shift since 2006; lighter, rise of products, etc. If you have a closer look at these 60% and break it up even further you get two more groups 

The 60% can be broken down even further

* 16% reaction: A group that tend to do the activities that require the least effort and are the least risk. 
* 44% initiation: Those type of activities that trigger the participation of other people; upload a photo

*- 23% of the online audience is still passive*    
Passivity is not as rooted in digital literacy as traditional wisdom may have suggested. 
11% of the people who are passive online today are early adopters. They have the access and the ability but *are choosing* not to participate.

All these percentage combined result in [this visual presentation](http://i.imgur.com/V3UFD.jpg)

*- Final notes*     
It is really worth it to watch the video

**My thoughts**     
Assuming this research is indeed executed properly and has yielded the correct results and assuming that the UK internet usage is somewhat representative for that of other (western) countries I do think that there is no denying that this does indeed impact how we have to look at Reddit and its users. In fact I do think this model suits Reddit pretty well imho

*- Intense participation*
&gt;The activities they lean to also require more effort

The most easy (and flattering) conclusion would be that these are the people that drive Reddit, the news subs). You might argue that when you submit you expose yourself to reddit and requires some skills (rules, etc) so most people submitting to largish reddits fit in this group. I am however not sure about submitting in defaults or in the smaller subs, more on that later. 

I am having a hard time fitting in the comments

*- Easy participation*
&gt; Those type of activities that trigger the participation of other people; upload a photo

I would argue that of the ""initiation group"" we find the biggest sample of this group in the smaller (local)subs where they can participate in the intimate group. However that would require knowledge about reddit as platform and the awareness that there is more than the defaults. 

So I think this group actually can be found in the defaults as passive users that might comment something easy but for the most still consume the content others provide for them. 
The lecture does not go into this but I am assuming that there is a 'grey area' between the different groups so it is entirely possible that of the ""initiation group"" on reddit some of them are actually in the process of transforming in intense participants by posting easy content to subreddits like the defaults (/r/pics and /r/aww come to mind) while others barely vote and would almost fit in the ""reaction group"" that is content by low effort participation and low risks. The ""reaction group"" would also be the group that you would never see commenting

*- Passive participation*     
This would be the group that only consumes and is hardly relevant for the functioning of Reddit. They might be relevant for Reddit as a company for add revenue but that is about it. 


*- Final thoughts*    
Although the 1% might be outmoded this research does seem to play well with [80/20 or Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), it is just something I noted but I could be seeing connections that are not there. 

The above is just a quick brainstorm about my initial thoughts after watching and writing the summary. I personally do think that this is more usable as a model than the one we currently use


So after writing this wall of text I am really curious about what other people think. I have only given it some initial thoughts so it would be great if people could expand on it. And as I already had the pleasure of attending of 2 real life lectures today I might have missed something because of an information overload ;) 

So what do you think? Does this change the way we might have to look at user behavior? In what way? And how would you apply it Reddit? ",,t5_2rtff,1350080840.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11dkzx/study_suggests_1990_or_1_rule_may_no_longer_apply/

This is almost a direct inversion of the way that boycotts usually work. Most boycotts are planned as ways to get companies to drop unjust or unpopular political involvement. The idea is to remove your patronage from a company so that your money doesn't go to a cause you can't

I can't think of a single instance in which a group has staged a boycott in order to force a company to *adopt* political advocacy. It actually ends up being counterproductive for CISPA advocates, in the future, any time a group wants Reddit on their side, they can just plot another boycott against them.

This all sets a very bad precedent. I understand the need to oppose legislation like CISPA

More than that, blocking out all other submissions, including other potentially important advocacy posts. It would mean that for entire days, the user involvement that generally decides which posts float to the top would be suspended. That, in essence, changes the basic operation of Reddit.

1327336968.0,ot0v9,An observation concerning the front page of Reddit.,blackstar9000,229,55,83,"The front page of Reddit -- that is

Let me talk a bit about LIM. I've used similar terms before. Basically, assessed, and voted on with relatively less effort than other forms of content.

An image macro, and most images are more quickly digested than a page of text. Another is that image macros are typically memes, and memes proliferate because they are familiar.

There's nothing inherently wrong with LIM

Even articles can be, titles that reduce the readers' investment. A sensationalistic title will do the trick. It does so by provoking an immediate reaction, so that the person who reads that title feels compelled to vote immediately, without having bothered to assess the article on the other side of the link. *That* is why so many of the articles that make it to the front page have comments that correct the title of the submission or the content of the article to which it links. The process of making a link to a GIM article into a LIM submission is, more often than not, destructive to whatever factual content it might have conveyed.

I've noted before that the new queue favors LIM the more active it grows. At lower levels of activity, LIM rapidly starts to take over.

The clearest example of that, videos are GIM and images are LIM, so as the /r/atheism new queue grew more active, the images displaced the videos.

The front page of the site (the page you see when you go to http://www.reddit.com/ while logged out) favors LIM even more. That's because it displays the default reddits

That means, it will generally favor the reddits that most favor LIM submissions. That's why three of the 20 default reddits (/r/pics, /r/aww, /r/AdviceAnimals) are explicitly dedicated to one of the most common types of LIM, images. /r/f712u would be up there, too, had the mods not opted out of default status. Others, /r/WTF, and increasingly so.

~~/r/AskScience had to revoke its default status in order to keep from being overrun by LIM comments.~~[*](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ot0v9/an_observation_concerning_the_front_page_of_reddit/c3jxr6d) /r/askreddit, by shifting away from an emphasis on the sort of answers and discussions they receive, and more toward eliciting personal expression. Thus, the topics that tend to win out on /r/AskReddit are not those that ask for definitive answers -- that would raise the investment needed to participate -- but rather those that ask everyone to give their own personal response to a question with no definitive answer.

The apparent exceptions are the reddits still mostly dedicated to news, and /r/science. But I'm not sure that even those are genuine exceptions. Rather, they've adapted by relying more heavily on LIM titling, which encourages the viewer to infer a given story's significance based on the perception they derive from the submission title. The titles that tend to do best are those that are most concise, direct, and unambiguous about the purported significance of the story -- that is, those about which people will tend to feel comfortable forming an opinion based on the title alone.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ot0v9/an_observation_concerning_the_front_page_of_reddit/

&gt;MIT’s Sinan Aral found that he could experimentally boost the popularity of articles 32 percent on a news aggregator, experimentally manipulating the initial number of likes and comments on each story. On balance, stories which were given an early boost ended up being more popular, compared to those that had no initial likes ... [but] Internet users are so systematically optimistic that they tended to reverse the articles with initial negative ratings. Thus, while the Internet tends to exaggerate positively valued stories, the same bias does not afflict negatively valued stories.

Now would be a good time to reflect on the [April 2013 option](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/) to temporarily hide comment scores.

SomethingAwful, like Games, Debate &amp; Discussion, Automotive Insanity, and General Bullshit (the catch-all subforum, frequently abbreviated ""GBS"").  The Redditbomb did not originate in General Bullshit, like so many Redditors seem to believe, but in a thread in Debate &amp; Discussion entitled ""Reddit is Awesome"".

RiA is a thread where we get together and mock terrible opinions and posts on Reddit.  We have similar threads for other sites

Honestly, and we were disgusted, but we didn't bother doing anything about them.  This one was different, because this one was unequivocally child porn.  /r/preteen_girls wasn't an SA plant or a false-flag operation or anything like that, it was merely a catalyst that turned Reddit is Awesome from a mock thread into a raid thread.

We started building the Redditbomb.  A user called Tony Danza Claus wrote the bomb in a few hours and posted an early draft to Reddit is Awesome.  The rest of us discussed it and made it better.  The bomb focused on the child porn, yesterday morning, the bomb went live.

Tony Danza Claus posted a new thread in General Bullshit about the so-called ""Pedocaust 2""

Not long after this, it absolutely looks like a raid, make no doubt about it.  In a lot of ways, it is, but the goal of the Redditbomb was and is to remove the child porn from Reddit.  Yeah, a few of us wanted to remove more than that (myself included).  However, having now pulled all of the *bait subreddits

I also want to (briefly) touch on some of the conspiracy theories.  No, actually quite like the idea of Reddit, even if we're not happy about how it's turned out.  No, we do not want to shut down /r/MensRights.  It's a popular topic in Reddit is Awesome and a lot of us think that it's full of a group of misogynistic douchebags, but ultimately nothing harmful goes on there and they have a right to their opinions.  Yes, we do still want subreddits like /r/beatingtrannies taken down, and a lot of us still want /r/seduction taken down.  However, we're not going to be raiding again.

It's also worth discussing the screenshot that's been going around about Lowtax, you'll see that everyone took it in stride as a joke.  SomethingAwful is, above all else, a comedy forum.  Yeah, we do serious stuff like this from time to time, but for the most part we keep to ourselves.  Your rage comics and cat pictures are perfectly safe from us :)

1)  Mods must be active as mods.  Of course real life does come into play and we can't help that.  However, it's best to cut them loose and replace them.  Be nice about it, people understand.

2)  Recruit from within.  Sorry, as I have found that different subs have different values, [mores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mores), cultures, in-jokes, etc.  Moderators *must* be familiar with the culture of the sub or they will definitely clash with the user base and cause unnecessary drama.

3)  Recruit the active

4)  Be transparent.  At least once a month we post a new [Meta] thread.  It always addresses current issues brought up in mod mail, plans for changes, and let users know what is going on.  This removes claims of ignorance of the rules of the sub and of being ""nazi mods"".  We actually get complaints that we post to many of them!  This is always better than complaining that mods don't engage.

5)  Actively discourage mods fighting users in public.  This encourages trolls, all those trouble users.  Always have them take it to mod mail, or have another moderator step in.  Moderators fighting with the user base is bad mojo, always.

6)  Have the mods talk to each other.  No team in the history of anything was successful if they didn't communicate.  If mods aren't talking your sub has issues.  Mod mail should be full of threads of moderators discussing issues about threads, rules, etc.  A private IRC channel doesn't hurt either.

7)  Treat all mods as equals.  If you have mods that pull rank, or publicly tear down other mods in public, you have issues.  You can't control a sub if the moderators are fighting each other.  The first sign you have a moderator who is trying to run roughshod over the others, its time to step back and have a pow-wow with the team, it might be time for someone to go.

8)  Cliques are bad.  Mods should not team up against other mods.  This isn't high school

9)  Have committed mods.  If you have a moderator that mods 20 subs

10)  Be friends.  Get to know each other beyond just the screen name.  I'm not suggesting spending your summers at each others houses

11)  Good moderator to user ratio.  We found that having one mod to about 6k users to work well for us.  It varies between subs and the relevant rules

12)  Let mods take breaks.  It's easy to burn out, let them work on real life stuff.  It's okay to let other mods relax.

13)  Large subs need international support.  We have hunted down users who live all over the world so that there is always someone who can at least keep the place from burning down.  If your sub hits 100k

This tension between order and disorder is fundamental to the nature of reddit. The cards are heavily stacked against the forces of order - here as in nature it is easier to blur than to focus, in which successful links are plucked from their homes and presented to an audience that may be completely ambivalent to its original context. Such an audience may not care at all how the link's subreddit wishes to evaluate the link and its comments, and their votes count just as much as those of subscribers who are faithful to their subreddit's vision. 

Note that I have no real issue with disordered reddit behavior on its own - it is as legitimate a use of the site as any

Recently a few subreddits have begun implementing a tag

I believe that these tags are an excellent presence for mods, and new users can understand that the content and comments may not reflect the nature of the subreddit they have just discovered.

It's an unfortunate irony that a link being widely approved in its subreddit can cause it to fall from the control of its subscribers. As far as I know mods do not have the power to prevent their links from breaching Mainstream-Reddit (nor do I believe that they should).

I realise this is looking like a suggestion, I'd just like a discussion on what effects it would have.

The ""sheep"" effect has a more prominent effect than any person would like to admit, this effect is increased.

Working under the assumption that the people using reddit have a favourable opinion of the general userbase (discounting trolls and mild masochists), subconsciously, they will alter their opinion on the subject matter, whether they've read it or not. This has the alarming effect of, whether it's an advantageous effect or not, leading to group confirmation bias, which on a site centralised on discussion is a bad thing, people are forming their judgement on a comment before they've read it.**

My proposition is this: hiding the votes, or at least stopping users from being told what to think, and changing it more towards the users forming their own world views. They would question every post, instead of knowing what their view ""should"" be before they read it.

It also has the side effect of people constantly having their views challenged should their votes go against the general consensus

*But*, would this lead to an exodus of users? People coming for mindless content instead of thought-provoking submissions would leave, but is this a bad thing?

Extra: What if it was an opt-in feature by the mods of specific reddits? What about for users?

Extra bonus: Forcing a user to say how much karma they THINK a user has accrued before they can read the actual value would be interesting

This is assuming that ""the proletariat"" DO read the scores on comments, great, but (personally) I don't think opinion circlejerks would form quite so spontaneously if users didn't have feedback about what everyone else thought.

**tl;dr** Good: encourages a person to form their own opinions before they are ""told what to think""

So

[Here's graph #1](http://i.imgur.com/kSqxMDT.png)

Most significant, there is a spread of 2869 (2872-3) and 2209 (2217-8). This shows that *more* comments are getting attention, instead of a *few* comments getting *a lot* of attention. But, as you can see from the numbers at the bottom, the total number of upvotes on the contest mode thread were hardly different from the total number of the non-contest mode thread from that same day. So, the upvotes were around the same in total, but more equally distributed. 

The vote seems to be much more indicative of the quality of the post (rather than how early it was posted)

[Here's graph #2](http://i.imgur.com/d3xNaOX.png)

This one just shows the #of child comments

[But if we take out the first 3 comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZPplw1P.png), the level of child comments peters out significantly down the thread. The largest difference, however, is the total number of child comments. The number of child comments in the contest mode was drastically lower than either of the non-contest mode posts. This shows that people were generally not expanding the child comments and replying to them. 

---
**Conclusions**
---

#1. Contest mode is **BAD** for:

* Users who simply reply to already-posted comments instead of posting their own. This practice, and because it hides the child comments by default. 

* Readers who only wish to read the most upvoted answers (or some other sorting method

* Users who do want to read child comments must expand them manually

* Responses normally hidden by downvotes will still be seen. This is good for certain threads in which the topic may be very one-sided (thus

#2. Contest mode is **GOOD** for:

* people who post after the first hour or so. Their comments have just as good of a chance to be seen as something that was there in the first minute. In fact

* Users who do not like reading replies have child comments automatically hidden

* Accurately rewarding the quality of the post

* Rewarding the top-level comments that actually answer the question, and jokes that usually pepper the child comments section.

Event-Based News Production on a Social News Site

There's been a fair amount of coverage on how Reddit has been used for breaking news coverage, the New York Times' [How Reddit Scooped the Press on the Aurora Shootings](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/reddit-aurora-shooter-aff/)). We wanted to examine how a social news site could produce news around a particular event, and luckily an interesting case study emerged when the /r/sandy subreddit was created to curate information about Hurricane Sandy.

The paper covers two topics: 

* what kind of content emerged as ""most relevant"" (looking at the top-1000 highest-scored posts to the subreddit)
* how mixed moderation (democratic voting + top-down actions by moderators) affected what content became relevant

tl;dr

* /r/sandy users were more ""experienced"" than average news-sharing users on Reddit (ie.
* reported news content (from actual news sources) appeared significantly less than other types of content, and humor
* almost all types of content were more likely to receive upvotes than reported news content

Right away,629 subscribers in the last week. By comparison, /r/atheism gained only 20,944. That's a difference of 13,685 users. Since users are automatically subscribed to all 20 default subreddits when they create an account, this means that a very large percentage of users are opting to stay subscribed to subreddits like /r/todayilearned, /r/funny, while unsubscribing from subreddits such as /r/atheism

Who doesn't like to learn new things (TIL), the three slowest growing subreddits are the most specialized - not everyone is an atheist, not everyone is a liberal, and not everyone enjoys memes. In fact, apparently a large percentage of new users are none of those things.

**How could this be done

1. **Link to screenshots.** Well, and it's impossible to see comments that weren't on the submitter's screen or were added after submission. Plus it's tricky and slightly time-consuming to make a good screenshot. So this is just frustrating for everyone involved. But it already exists as an option, and perhaps someone could come up with a way to make it less frustrating, so it's worth mentioning. /u/redditbots has already automated this in a realistically good way, but I don't know how complicated it would be for a human to use the same pipeline.
2. **Use an external website that duplicates reddit threads.** Again, I don't know how practical it is for humans to do the same thing the bot does.
3. **Build it into [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)**. In principle
4. **CSS trickery?** We already know subreddit stylesheets can hide the vote arrows etc.
5. **Cookie magic?** reddit already has a read-only mode: it's when you're logged out. Maybe through some sort of wizardry, I'm an HTTP muggle, so I'm just proposing it in case someone else knows how.
6. **Request it from the admins.** Again, so good luck. (EDIT: FWIW, [I suggested it in /r/ideasfortheadmins.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/10kqn0/readonly_viewing_mode_for_comment_pages/))

---

**How could this be enforced easily?**

1. **Use [AutoModerator](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/onl2u/automoderator_a_bot_for_automating/) to remove non-read-only links** and politely inform submitters how to do it right. Shouldn't be hard
2. **Use CSS to replace the Submit button with a read-only link submitter.** At least the CSS side of this is easy (e.g. /r/atheism)
3. **Use CSS to replace all links with read-only versions.** Not sure if possible/practical.

I had been subscribed to a large number of sub-reddits^1 (somewhere in the 80's), the smaller subs got drowned out, even if I aggressively went through and hid everything from the bigger subs that I was subscribed to.  I didn't think much of this - after all smaller subs have less traffic.  Most of the posts on my front-page were in karma triple-figures, and quite a few were in quadrule figures.  Even Never-Ending-Reddit took three or four pages to get me to double-digit posts.

However since Gold expired, I'll either re-subscribe, or I'll realise I don't miss them.  

Now I know that I could set up lots of customised widgets with RES, and it doesn't behave the way I expect.  It's not necessarily a failing of RES, though.  

My questions for ToR are these:

1) Has anyone else had a similar experience?

2) Would it be worth making a submission in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins for a feature that allows you give additional weight to smaller subs that you've subscribed to?  I think this would allow you tweak to an even larger degree what you see on your personalised home-page.  Does this belong on RES?

 &gt; Theory of Reddit is a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better. 

Please keep this in mind at all times, not problems. 

##The wiki

**Almost the [entire wiki is editable](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/wiki_protocol) by our regular users!** Regulars are any user with an account older than 90 days and who has accumulated at least 50 subreddit karma. 

  - We do welcome user contributions since a lot of knowledge is gathered here but also lost since it is hard to search for. With the wiki we aim to fix that and every helping hand is welcome!



##On moderation 

   -  We are still ""TheoryOfReddit"" so questions without theories will be removed. 
   -  Removed posts can always be found in our [public modlog](/r/theoryofmoderation) and if possible a better suited subreddit will be suggested.
   -  Unsure how a good /r/theoryofreddit post would look like
   -  We can't mention it enough
        - This does include ""what if"" scenarios that still require admin intervention to be executable.
   - We do actively remove comments that are bigoted

There is also a circlejerk-type [request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9u8t/ama_request_the_intern_who_suggested_woody_should/) looking for the intern who came up with the idea in the first place.

This has obviously not helped the movie at all. Many people are commenting that they will boycott the movie and Harrelson in general. My question is whether or not this will curb the influx of celebrity AMAs

To be fair

I personally think the celebrity AMAs are hit or miss, was a Redditor accusing him of taking a [friend's virginity without calling afterward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlalf?context=3). 

Anyways

Edit: More stuff I came across.

Just saw that the virginity story has become a [meme in itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/p9reb/woody_meet_reddit/) being on the front page of /r/funny.

# Background

I mod a NSFW subreddit. Recently

# Interesting results

The post made by the spammer was sitting in our spam queue until sometime yesterday when it disappeared. This was odd as most spammers don't delete their own posts so I went to the moderation log. What I found there was ""interesting"" to say the least: The post still existed but had been *moved* to another subreddit: **/r/_takedowns**.  I can't view the version of the post in _takedowns (due to private subreddit restrictions)

* http://www.reddit.com/comments/13kfcz/_

The page is titled ""bummer"" and says:

&gt; this page is no longer available due to a copyright claim.

# What is _takedowns?

\/r\/_takedowns is a private subreddit and is presumably admin-controlled. There is a config file in reddit's code ([link to github](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/example.ini#L388)) which says this is a subreddit used for DMCA takedowns. Those lines were added 3 years ago in [this commit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/e6838895e04fd683ea6477b2dba19e889681edb8#r2/example.ini)

Interestingly, as if the people in /r/beer actually prefer Bud Light but are just too proud to admit it, and so they pretend to like fancy beers. 

By contrast, astrologists, and supporters of alternative medicine are condemned. But on other matters, deference to experts is derided as elitist. 

I guess I just find it interesting that so many people seem genuinely *offended* by the idea that the quality of something is not determined democratically. Apparently

I could go on and on. Now, Bud Light is really popular, and so it's pretty annoying if someone goes to a party and makes fun of all the people drinking Bud Light (and this is coming from a self-professed beer snob). What I am confused about, though, is why people seem to expect that the /r/beer should promote Bud Light and /r/food should encourage dining at Applebee's.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many reposts? Who would do that

How it works, gets YT partnership and then makes &gt;1$ per 1000 views.
But, you might ask. r/videos has over 1M registered users and another few millions lurkers and all you need is to get your video on frontpage for massive profit. But Knights of new are brave guardians, they would never allow blatant repost to get through! They are trying, but they are fighting with upvote bots, [exhibit 1](http://i.imgur.com/XfqPl.jpg): 1 default upvote+30 bots vs 4 Knights on blatant repost.

Can you provide more evidence/insight into how exactly this works?
Sure, so take it with a grain of salt.
There are 2 main perpetrators : bot farmers and YT uploaders.
Bot farmer rents serverhosting for a few dollars a month on a few dozen servers to make hundreds or even thousands of accounts with different IP, but  returns are insane.[ exhibit2](http://i.imgur.com/OrUOD.jpg), enough said. (all is scripted)

SPECULATION: bot detection takes into account age and comment+post upvotes
semiproof: if you look into new for these subreddits
/SPECULATION

So someone made shitton of ""valid"" accounts
Here come YT uploaders who rents these for
And there are dozens of such accounts

How is it currently handled and what can be done better?
All moderators do is either ban the account which submitted it (pure new accounts

 -Instead of banning worthless accounts flag these videos and ask users to report them on YT. This scares spammers because YT accounts with decent view counts are valuable. 

-Improve bot detecting algorithm to look for cliques with similar taste and suspiciously similar timing

ToR had three comments prominently featured in /r/bestof in the last month - [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14vz3i/reddit_ceo_uyishan_makes_a_promise_we_will_not/), at +1970, +1959, and +1473. One would expect that most people would discover this subreddit after the first post and subscribe then, and the second and the third post wouldn't bring as many new subscribers.

Stats:

However,300 new subscribers from last two posts (mostly the second one).


### Moderator stats

A common wisdom says that in any given popular subreddit, mod actions tend to follow exponential distribution. Let's see if this is true with ToR data for the last two months since the current mod team stabilized.

[Main graph](http://i.imgur.com/JfpZc.png) shows (1) comment removals, and (4) exponential distribution of current mods. These are normalized and mapped into [0,1] interval, so values of Y axis are meaningless here.

Note that three types of mod actions were sorted independently, as mod actions are incomparable.

As you can see

Three more graphs that show actual values:

* [Distinguish](http://i.imgur.com/aSALH.png)

1330589639.0,qcp5j,A quick analysis of Neil Tyson's most recent AMA.  What should Reddit's approach be to the celebrity AMA in general?,nicotinedreams,143,16,39,"Earlier tonight, ""Space Chronicles"",000 upvotes and 3

As the [Woody Harrelson AMA fiasco](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) made painfully clear, the AMA format is ideal in many ways.  It's free, it doesn't require any on-screen appearances, and it can be done from anywhere at virtually any time of day.  On the other hand, the AMA never was and never will be a 5-minute talk show appearance.  Good AMA's take time to solicit questions, read and type out answers, which are then permanently available for anyone to read.  There's no witty talk-show host to entertain and fill time, the fans are the ones writing and upvoting the questions, celebrities continue to come to Reddit to do AMA's promoting their work.

But if both Neil Tyson's and Woody Harrelson's AMA's were promotional in nature, not all of the ""questions"" Neil chose to answer were even questions at all.  So why was the AMA such a hit?

I think that there are several reasons.

1. He revealed insights into his personal philosophy on life

2. He chose a variety of questions.  Neil commented on topics from politics and science to personal heroes and even [fictional cartoon heroes](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wh6uo?context=3).  By doing this he implicitly answered a lot of other questions about himself such as his interests and random cultural elements that he's paid attention to

3. He didn't just answer questions

4. He was honest.  This one is technically hard to prove

5. He didn't shamelessly promote his book.  As I mentioned before, or increased publicity for a new book/movie, can only come secondarily to this.

That's all I can think of right now.  What do you guys think?  What should we expect from celebrity AMA's for them to be successful,,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,True

Reddit is consumed as a flow of information. We expect reddit to continually change and our interest in reddit is observing the change each day (new posts). Wikipedia on the other hand is for storing information and we value the stock of information it contains

This has important implications for the difference in the economics of these two forms

A stock is analogous to a durable good, the stock isn't depleted from use. The flow of reddit is like a non-durable consumption good as a hamburger. I eat today's hamburger and have to get a new one to consume tomorrow. 

Reddit has little value as a stock. The information is already on the web, noel information must flow into it. Therefore, reddits value is that it provides a focal point for users, rather than having assets that are valuable. Like with Facebook, in reddit it is the person doing the posting that is the valuable asset, not the posts themselves.

",41,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/10mdle/should_reddit_limit_how_often_you_can_post_right/,"Recently there has been a trend towards users either manually or by using bots posting content at a very high frequency. Some have done this at burst rates up to 100 submissions per hour. It's very hard to believe anyone could be manually finding content that fast, entering titles and submitting.

I see a bit of a problem with this. If enough bots/users start to post at a very high frequency their submissions will start to drown out submissions made by regular users. The submissions made by these high frequency users would start to dominate what most people see in the /r/all/new/ and in subreddit specific new queues

For those of you not familiar with what was going on then over at digg I'll TL;DR it. Before the V4 update all the submissions on the front page of the website were submitted by called power users. They used the tools built into digg to promote their submissions faster than the ""natural"" progression of upvotes. Some possibly used outside tools as well. This meant that the power users submitted the vast majority of content, right before the digg v4 update it was rare if you saw even one post by a regular user on the front page.

If reddit starts to get just 20 bots or users who submit on average a submission every 2 minutes that would mean 1 submission every 6 seconds is posted by a bot. This would quite effectively flood the /r/all/new/ queue as well as any subreddits that the bots submit to. This could lead to a situation where the bots content ""pushes away"" the content submitted by regular users

Almost three years ago I wrote ""[Attacked from Within](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2009/3/12/33338/3000)"" a very long essay on the viability of online community.  It was based on my experience with a number of online communities that I've been a part of: Slashdot, 4chan, Hacker News, Reddit, and others.

Because the essay is tl;dr length

1. Eternal September is a problem of scale.  It is very difficult to sustain community in the face of scale.
2. Pseudonymity isn't a solution to the problems of trolling, and shitposting.  Anonymity isn't either, but it also doesn't feature some of the negatives or false-promise of pseudonymity.  Active moderation either by mods or by the community cannot maintain community culture and standards in the face of scale.
3. Moderation needs to focus on quality contribution not agreement.  Passive/automatic moderation can be an effective first pass.
4. Quality conversation is a better indicator of contribution than voting.  Pairs/dyads of high quality comments should be the key metric

Since writing ""Attacked from Within""

I would be happy to discuss any ideas in the essay or more generally relevant to the problems of sustaining community on the web in the face of scale.  I'm a full-time student and therefore a full-time redditor

1355603579.0,14wpow,"Meta-subreddits, invasions, and you: a case for No Participation CSS",Jess_than_three,188,75, most of my examples will be drawn from that.

Secondly

**What harms do meta-subreddit invasions cause?**

There are two main issues here: voting and commenting.

*On voting:*

* A meta-subreddit's users

* Comments may be flipped from positive scores to negative

* This makes it appear as though the linked community supports views it doesn't

* In turn

* Users who have good, negative, poorly-received-by-the-community things to say may be encouraged.

* Users may leave entirely.

* Newcomers and outsiders get the wrong idea

* Users who would have been positive members of the community may be turned away; users who would not may be likelier to stay and participate.

* This leads to an increase in hostilities and tension and drama, /r/RedditDrama, etc. may link because drama; /r/BestOf may link because look at someone putting someone else in their place; /r/WorstOf and /r/ShitRedditSays may link because look at someone saying something terrible (and in the case of SRS, look at ""the community"" upvoting it - although those votes may be from external subreddits)) - causing the cycle to perpetuate itself, and the subreddit to descend into nastiness over time.

* [Here is a very dramatic example of a meta-subreddit reversing the views of the community to which it linked](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14vz7u/subredditdrama_ainbow_a_man_makes_a_stark/). You can find more in /r/MetaLog

These effects are likelier to matter if your community is smaller - particularly if it's smaller than the linking subreddit, I don't think anyone takes seriously the idea of an /r/pics community that holds aggregate views; if you're a moderator of a default subreddit, you may not be concerned about the prospect of your community's views being misrepresented by the votes of outsiders. But if you moderate a smaller community, it may be a bigger deal for you. This is especially true if your community surrounds any sort of niche interest, anything that causes aggregate opinions to skew differently from those of reddit as a whole.

*On commenting:*

* Often

* This frequently derails discussions

* Sometimes

* [Here is a list of users showing up to comment on an at-that-time month-old thread in /r/pics

* Meta-subreddit links can also

* [Here's an example from /r/ainbow](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/wv5xh/meta_stop_starting_shit_in_other_subreddits_guys/) ([original thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/wi5q4/trans_rainbowers_does_this_really_offend_you/c5do0bh)) where a bunch of people show up to spout nasty

* [Here's a really terrible example from /r/AmIUgly](http://www.reddit.com/r/DramaLog/comments/14pku7/jokeaway_metadear_srd_fuck_you/c7f8tum)

* The /r/pics example

* I won't link this, but the harassment they received was honestly very serious, hurtful, and damaging to them.

The derailing-of-comments effect may or may not be something your community cares about. Again, as discussions tend to be large and meandering to begin with. If your subreddit is at all topical, however, this can definitely impact the quality of discussions for your users.

The harassment issue is something that impacts potentially any subreddit, either, because you need to rely on someone reporting the comments - especially in a big subreddit.

**A solution? Or at least an improvement?**

A couple of months back, or voting. (Click the link and you'll see what it looks like, applied to normal CSS.) This is quick and easy to do, and carries virtually zero costs.

By ""virtually zero costs""

* Subscribers to a subreddit using No Participation will never see a difference. NP is set up to show the normal CSS to subscribed users

* Non-subscribers coming to the subreddit via any other route will also never see a difference. This means that if threads showing up on /r/all and drawing in people from reddit at large is important to your subreddit and a way that you gain new members

* It doesn't affect your CSS in any other way. Visitors coming through np.reddit.com links will see all of your fancy custom CSS

* It's easily reversible

One argument I've seen raised about this is that it doesn't *solve* the problem, if this makes a community seem *a little bit* less hostile to its own members, if it prevents even just *one* instance of harassment that would have happened impulsively had the opportunity been easily there, then I'm in favor of it. 

And the point has also been raised that this CSS makes it so that invading users have to take an extra action in order to do what they're going to do - an action that forces them to acknowledge directly that they're actively disrespecting the wishes of the community that they're visiting. That

**But this requires that meta-subreddits choose to implement policies that mandate np.reddit.com links!**

It does indeed. One way that that becomes likelier to happen is if more subreddits install NP

**As a moderator of a meta-subreddit

* Because you should respect the wishes of other subreddits' communities. Not every subreddit to which you link will install No Participation, certainly you should respect that choice.

* Because it will make your subreddit look good. Nobody likes a vote brigade

* Because you don't want other subreddits misrepresenting *your* community's views with their votes

* Because reducing the amount of vote brigading on reddit would have the secondary effect of reducing the petty tribalism that's been infecting the site: the us-vs.-them they're-a-brigade-so-we-have-to-brigade-back mentality.

On the other hand, it's still pretty obvious when a bot can't respond well to questions.

But what if someone made a bot that made comments on popular Reddit posts? And not something that's expressly or obviously a bot (since that's been done before), since nobody expects it and there are hundreds of Redditors on a given thread.

I particularly like the idea of browsing r/all/top or r/askreddit/new with this, if not many, upvotes.

And then entertain the possibility that this happened already. There are lots of programmers on Reddit, would it even be detectable? People not expecting a bot would give it a lot of leeway.

What do you think about the feasibility? Do you know if this has been done? What interesting consequences would there be if someone created a well-liked account that was later revealed to be a bot?

(Involving hiding comment scores on comments/posts a user hasn't yet voted on.),,141,21,31,"This is an idea I proposed a while back that got a decent amount of upvotes and a positive response, but it seems like a comment's score has a high propensity to snowball. Obviously

The best way to test this would clearly be an in-depth study comparing the responses of ""average"" Redditors to the same posts, instead. I have crafted a set of CSS styles that hide the scores of posts and comments until after the user has voted on them. This could be implemented either by subreddits or by individuals, using a browser extension. I'd be interested to hear about results from both.

This is the code I wrote:

    .score.unvoted { display:none; }
    div#siteTable div.midcol.unvoted div.arrow.down { margin-top: 18px; }
    div#siteTable div.midcol.unvoted div.arrow.login-required.down { margin-top: 18px; }

Any takers?

[The discussion over in /r/programming/ is also worth a read](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/16p3p8/the_mathematics_of_reddit_rankings_or_how_upvotes/).

As the article points out

If it hasn't been conclusively proved before that low effort content rises to the top then this article certainly proves it. I think that we could draw the conclusion that if you don't want fluff to reach the top that content moderation is necessary.

It's a bit sad that the algorithm works like this

If it takes 10 users .5 seconds to decide to upvote the image and 10 other users 1 minute to decide to upvote the article then the image inherently is ranked above the article even if they are submitted at the same time and if the users opened the links at the same time.

IMO this shows quite conclusively that for a subreddit to have quality content on the front page that content moderation is necessary.

I think reddit as a whole would benefit content-quality wise if a handicap were introduced for images and videos which would decrease the worth of an upvote

1350341547.0,11jcok,A structural explanation for the controversies that have erupted on and around Reddit over the last several years.,blackstar9000,146,26,93,"One principle that I always try to keep in mind when dealing with online communities is: that changes in the structure or features of a site will tend to have disproportionately large results—and particularly so as you introduce economies of scale.

That's what happened with subreddits. Many of you may not remember that when Reddit started, it became virtually impossible to keep up with the torrent of new submissions flooding through the front page. Giving users the ability to create their own named queues was a way of outsourcing the solution to that problem. Once the mechanism was up and running, the admins could theoretically sit back and watch as the community itself branched off into topical reddits that eased the traffic in each individual sub.

Enter, users have created tens of thousands of subs. The vast majority of them are idle, or virtually so. Search for any given term in the subreddit search, and you'll find only a fraction that are really active, a substrate of significantly less trafficked subs, and a base of subs that were created seemingly with no purpose or demand. It's a fair bet that a portion of those dead subs were created on accident (there seems to have been a lot of confusion between submitting a link and creating a sub at some point) or squatters sitting on a name.

That fragmentation makes it virtually impossible to keep up with the entire site. When the admins added subs, as I described it to someone else, is the same as giving a Reddit-branded bullhorn to all-comers, without respect to what message they want to shout through it. They might talk about politics or religion or cats. Or they might yell fire in one of the most crowded theaters on the Web.

There are, but the extreme fragmentation of the site often makes it difficult to know when those rules are being broken. A breach in the defaults will generally be found out almost immediately, but there are corners of the site that are infrequently trafficked by anyone who would report infractions to the admins.

When someone *does* find them, and the URL will say ""reddit"" in the domain. For a year or two now, the admins have argued that Reddit is less a single community than it is an engine for community-creation. Part of the implication there is that they're only responsible for the tool itself, and not the content shared by the people using it. That's a premise that would be easier to maintain if we, the users, were setting up instance of Reddit on our own domains, like Wordpress or Drupal. But because Reddit continues to host nearly all of the communities created with its toolset, and likely will continue to see it that way so long as the offending subs appear on the Reddit domain.

In retrospect, and shifted some responsibility for rooting out those infractions on people who had created subs specifically to host those infractions.

That situation goes a long way toward explaining some of the biggest controversies surrounding Reddit. Once the admins had given over the ability to create subs to the users, which led them to rely more and more heavily on mods like Violentacrez to serve as their go-between and keep the site from running afoul of the law.

This may not be the place to discuss solutions, or string of lawsuits, at some point. Whether or not those lawsuits are successful, they will add prohibitively to the cost of the site. The diminishing public reputation of the site may well slacken its growth and scare off advertisers.

There have been several threads lately asking about the sustainability of Reddit. My prediction is that, maintaining the site will grow more difficult, which will, in turn, impact the performance of the site. Diminished performance will result in fewer users, and the more like a ghost town the site appears, the faster the population will drop. Those things may not kill Reddit outright, alongside social sites like Friendster and Digg.

If anyone can think of a way that moderators or users can address those problems, so that we can better understand how the structure of the site has set the stage for the controversies that have recently begun to all but define the public's perception of Reddit and its users.",,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,

Click values still aren't very high but in this case they make more sense compared to the size of these subreddits (/r/EarthPorn has about 300 users online per day compared to /r/adviceanimals 10, people probably already know about those. The menu in the SFWPorn Network is much more for subreddit discovery than navigation.

I've also been using goo.gl links for announcement stickies you might see in the banner or at the top of a subreddit.

In /r/metalcore we had an [AMA on March 25-26th](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/1b04ne/my_name_is_josh_schroeder_i_recordedproduced_know/) and our [uniques for the 25th was 1

In /r/EarthPorn we've had /r/SpringPorn stickied to the top since March 23rd and it has been clicked [2090 times](http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/u1C5U/all_time) ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Rg93u1V.png)).

In /r/kpop we've had our calendar stickied to the banner since December 24th and it has been clicked [1701 times](http://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/8sulH/all_time) ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/03SECGz.png)). 

----

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the amount of clicks we're seeing so far. /r/adviceanimals gets about 4, unfortunately we can never really know for sure but I think this is our best measure for it so far. 

The number of clicks for the SFWPorn Network also seems to support my previous [idea of subreddit discovery with a menu](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/rc7t8/the_effect_of_inducting_a_subreddit_into_a/).

1. **There's a new rule in the sidebar.** It reads: ""Submissions that would be appropriate for /r/SubredditDrama will be removed from TheoryOfReddit by the moderators."" That rule is taking the place of the SRS rule. Here's fair warning: I intend to take a rather broad interpretation of that rule. No more singling out mods for bad behavior. No more speculation about who's responsible for the decline of this or that reddit

2. **Once a guideline, solutions, or strategies that could be reasonably addressed or implemented by users and moderators""? When I introduced it, I meant for it to be a guideline. From now on, I intend to enforce it as a rule. If your submission is a suggestion that only the admins could implement, it will be removed from ToR. As with the new rule, there's a place for stuff like that

3. **Links are back.** At least, but it seemed like the best solution at the time. As it happens, I think the two changes I've spelled out above will resolve a lot of the problems that going text-only previously fixed, so we're going to see how reintroducing them helps.

First of all
---

Is it displaying properly for everyone? It should more or less [like this](http://i.imgur.com/mElaT.png). It's built in CSS to make it easier to implement in different reddits \([for example](/r/worldevents)\)

So what's it for?
---

Well, here's the thought process behind it.

Reddit has a general [etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), but not all subscribers vote with the same criteria in mind. When exhortation fails, the mods sometimes have to resort to more intensive moderation just to keep the forum pointed in the right direction.

The Vote Fader is an attempt to implement a clear, to those that users are most encouraged to down vote, with some middle ground for more ambiguous posts. Or, from another point of view, content types listed at the top are those that are ""most wanted or appropriate"", and they ""fade"" down from there to content types that are totally inappropriate and unwanted.

The point is to give users a relatively simple and easy to understand graphic so that they'll be better informed about the purposes of the reddit, intuit its meaning, and incorporate those guidelines into their voting habits for the reddit where it's displayed.

Cool. So how do I put one on my reddit?
---

Maybe you shouldn't. Many reddits probably don't need a vote fader. If your subscribers seem to be voting along with the intent of the reddit, so having something like this is helpful for that, but it might not fit every reddit out there.

Besides, so let's not make this a totally standard feature just yet, okay?

Pfft. Whatever. Just show me how it works.
---

Okay

First, but the basic idea is to have a color gradient representing up vote to down vote.

Next

    .side a[href^=""//#fader""] {
    height: 150px;   
    width: 250px;   
    padding-left: 50px;   
    background-image: url(%%fader%%);   
    color: black;   
    display: inline-block;   
    background-repeat: no-repeat;   
    cursor: default;   
    line-height: 1.4;   
    text-align: center   
    }

Finally

    Voting guidelines:
    ---

    [Most appropriate content  
    Moderately appropriate content  
    Marginally appropriate content  
    Neutral content  
    Marginally inappropriate content  
    Moderately inappropriate content  
    Most inappropriate content](//#fader)

(*edit:* [Idonthack](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/my0qo/the_vote_fader/c34vorz) reminded me that you can put white space in code when using markdown.) With its current settings, you can stretch them to fit the fader by tweaking the *line-height* attribute of the CSS. It's currently set to 1.4; increasing that number puts more space between each line so that adhere closer to the color coded space in the background.

Isn't that a terribly inefficient way to achieve that effect?

I've been a long-time contributor here, and I honestly believe that this subreddit is helping immensely in that regard.

I strongly believe in active moderation. Due to the ""assembly line"" nature of reddit, and if the users are submitting content that is off-topic for the subreddit, instead of just silently removing the submission (essentially sweeping it under the rug), moderators should let the submitter know exactly why their post was not appropriate, and if possible suggest an alternative subreddit where the submission would be welcomed.

I also believe in having a large

In a unanimous decision by the moderation team, and the community agrees. As a result, we have removed rule 4 (the rule banning image submissions), as it is no longer possible to submit those. We have also combined rules 2 and 3 into a single rule, which leaves us with three simple, easy to understand rules governing this subreddit.

I want to thank you all for bearing with us through this brief time of dramatic change. In the last month this subreddit has gone from one with unenforced guidelines that was largely moderated by the community (through the use of upvotes and downvotes)

That's a big change, /r/CasualTheoryOfReddit. Casual TOR, much like /r/CasualIAmA, will be completely moderated by the users. Only obvious spam will be removed. I've added /u/AutoModerator with instructions to approve absolutely every submission or comment in that subreddit.

I'm hoping this comes off as helpful to the discussion here rather than just looking like shameless self promotion (which there's a lot of in academia but is truly not my goal here).

Summary: We study crowd-curation mechanisms that rank articles according to a score which is a function of user- feedback. We precisely quantify the dynamics of which articles become popular in these systems. While crowd-curation can be relatively effective for cardinal objectives like discovering and promoting content of high quality, suggesting that active moderation of user behavior is important for high quality curation in crowd-sourced systems.

The recent use private information to scare off undesirable accounts is in theory a great move. It cleans up the site and removes a great deal of controversy. But it has also said that you can punish those you disagree with by threatening to put their personal information online or by actually publishing their information. In a nutshell it promotes vigilantes go out and create the justice the desire rather than the justice they get. 

This form of retribution was now has a sort of legitimacy to it. The problem occurs when it is not used against vile and reprehensible people and instead gets used on those you just don't agree with. What now stops a person seeking to get rid of a high karma account with many low investment posts to simply begin doxxing those accounts or at least legitimately threatening to dox until they delete their account?

They are the [strawman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman) and [motive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive) fallacies respectively

I'd like to discuss them with you

---

The Sarcastic Caps Strawman is when you present a loud mockery of an opponent's position sarcastically. This should be easy to visualize

&gt; **Megan:** I don't think we can sustain social security into the 21st century.

&gt; **Christina:** HHAAHAHA BECAUSE LETTING POOR PEOPLE STARVE IS SO PROGRESSIVE AND FORWARD-THINKING. 

Christina's response takes ""we can't sustain social security into the 21st century"" and misrepresents it as ""removing social security is forward-thinking and progressive"", and the finances could add up in favor of social security. At the moment, Christina's response attacks neither -- it just makes a claim to how Megan sees her views.

If your audience is intelligent, people like Megan have several concerns if they want to convince an audience that they're right:

- Megan sees through the layer of sarcasm and notices that the argument is a strawman, a rebuttal that unfortunately is acceptable when your audience is not mature and accepts responses like the Sarcastic Caps Strawman as sufficient.

- Megan responds with equally loud sarcasm attacking Megan's strawman, this could work. However, if she has two-sides to juggle -- people who are above this sort of technique and people who aren't -- she may alienate the side of her audience that would be persuaded by a more formal, direct argument.

Christina, she can just say someone else doesn't get her joke or that she's being taken too seriously. If she is responded to with similar levels of sarcasm, the people who originally took Megan seriously stop taking her seriously.

In other words, it's advantageous to do it because you have more ways of escaping criticism. It's a form of [hedging.](http://tinyurl.com/hedgingwikipedia)

On the other hand

---

The second technique, you address the *reasons they could be making the argument*.  The official term for this is [""ad hominem circumstantial""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Circumstantial) because it asserts that someone's circumstances in which they are making an argument affect the truth of that argument.

The most common version of ""translation"" redditors have experienced goes like this:

&gt; **Megan:** Taxing Americans in the 250-500k range would probably just tax cognitively demanding professions like engineers; you should tax people in the 500k+ range

&gt; **Christina:** Translation: ""Don't take away money from *my* family

Here

This technique's history of usage on reddit goes as far back as the novelty account [Translated](http://www.reddit.com/user/Translated) in 2007.

It's worth noting that this type of critique isn't always fallacious. Many people take on a pretension when arguing for or against some thing. These techniques

As an active Reddit user - crazy active, when I couldn't think of any other website with an application alternative that I preferred.

Maybe it's blaspheme, it is confusing. I have friends that aren't users simply because the first few visits result in confusion. It took me time and a lot of convincing to finally give the site a chance for the same reason. The colors are meek and sometimes they clash distractedly, the layout is kind of messy and definitely confusing if you aren't familiar with it, and the default CSS is an absolute mess. It's a design that scares people away, and if it wasn't for my discovery of a few beautifully designed apps, and RES' night mode, I probably would have turned away from Reddit.

Which raises an interesting question: Why is RES expected to innovate rather than the site itself? I've noticed that when features are mentioned

Additionally, and this is surprising when you consider the ridiculous popularity of the site, the obvious downsides to the current design, and the rapidity of web technologies and standards growth and evolution.

1308669774.0,i5bb1,"What happens when a small, navel gazing reddit gets a sudden, large influx of new subscribers?",blackstar9000,118,44

Thanks (and I *do* mean thanks) to a shout out from [subtextual](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/i486a/so_im_unsubscribing_from_all_the_major_subs_what/c20s9cx) yesterday, the population of /r/ToR has increased by about 25% in a single day.

Which would be, but as davidreiss666 just pointed out to me, we've also caught the eye of reddit co-founder kn0thing, who just [tweeted about us](http://twitter.com/#!/kn0thing/status/83169655027539968). Thanks to him, as well. Uniques for the day are already up to more than half what they were yesterday, which is to say, about three times what they are on any normal day. I won't be able to see new subscriptions until tomorrow

So first, in bold letters so it doesn't get lost **welcome to Theory of Reddit!** Thanks for stopping by, and thanks to those of you who've subscribed. If you'd like a little background, here's [my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/cbjrn/a_little_bit_of_background_as_to_why_i_created/) explaining what led me to create this reddit. If you have any questions as to how people are expected to conduct themselves here, the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is as good a starting place as any.

All of this comes at a rather auspicious time, and that it's turned into a thriving community of like-minded people is due mostly to those of you who stuck it out over the last 12 months.

We talk a lot in /r/ToR about the impact that large crowds have on reddits, among other things, that we'll likely get more per day subscriptions than before. But faster growth won't necessarily mean the sort of decline in quality that we've lamented in other, huger reddits. This is a chance to watch growth up close, and to talk about what it takes for a reddit to accommodate that growth without losing its soul. Hopefully, what we learn from this can be used to create stronger communities throughout reddit.

1366391824.0,1coowx,/r/findbostonbombers is a perfect illustration of systematic error - or how the crowd can fail,AsABlackMan,149,51,42,"The answer is really simple too - [systematic error](http://www.physics.umd.edu/courses/Phys276/Hill/Information/Notes/ErrorAnalysis.html).

Typically large groups of people make the ""right"" decision. When you have a whole lot of people guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar

But when our biases affect what kind of errors we make. They become systematic errors. When we have biases about how the world works

Typically we don't have strong biases about jellybeans and jars, and nationalism we're prey to a whole lot of biases that affect how we see and interpret data.

The fact that reddit focused on a [brown-skinned guy](http://i.imgur.com/3Bh7rkc.gif) with an Indian name as the prime suspect is probably the most telling thing. It might imply that there's a definite bias on who redditors expected to be capable of perpetrating this crime. Either that

No online community can be immune from systematic error because we're all subject to biases that we're not even aware of. This is especially true when it comes to important issues like what happened in Boston.

What users and moderators can do is fact-check. Confirmation bias is a subtle beast and it's a tough thing to beat. In fact I'm willing to bet that some of you will look at [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/3Bh7rkc.gif) and still conclude the innocent guy and the suspect look alike while completely ignoring how terrible the data (the source pictures) are.

But the best thing to do is to discourage this sort of crowdsourced investigation for deeply emotional issues. Biases rise to the surface and that makes a reddit ~~witch hunt~~ investigation problematic at best

**TLDR**: We all have deeply ingrained biases that surface when something deeply emotional happens. These biases affect how we interpret the world and can lead us to the wrong conclusions. That's what happened with /r/findbostonbombers. The Miracle of Aggregation broke down because people's errors weren't random,False,,t5_2rtff,False,,,t3_1coowx
1365611961.0,1c2lkl,"Top domains submitted to reddit redux (as of March 27, 2013)",Deimorz,136,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1c2lkl/top_domains_submitted_to_reddit_redux_as_of_march/

I also manually combined a few domains that point to the same thing:

* youtu.be into youtube.com
* qkme.me into quickmeme.com
* redd.it into reddit.com
* min.us into minus.com
* wp.me into wordpress.com
* fav.me into deviantart.com

There are probably some more that would be reasonable to combine, here's almost the top 1000 this time instead (I dumped out the top 1000 and then merged the 6 listed above):

This is out of a total of 41, excluding the 12,435,395 self-posts. [I posted a table of the top 20 subreddits with the most self-posts in the previous comments if you're interested in that](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1by2yv/top_100_external_domains_submitted_to_reddit_as/c9bcvyb)

1364885271.0,1bi2gf,Why doesn't Reddit like my bot?,fowlt,151,50,88,"Hi all. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this question; please let me know if you know a better place. 

Anyway, etc.), gives them to fowlt, and posts a reply when fowlt thinks the comment contains an error. I also did my best to make sure the bot is as nice as possible. It uses this account, see [the user page](http://www.reddit.com/u/fowlt) if you're interested.

What I expected were a few grumpy replies, I got mostly downvotes and super-unfriendly replies. I've turned it off for now - my goal isn't at all to annoy people.

My questions to you now are:

* Why do you thing people hated my bot so much?
* What could I do to improve it?",,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1bi2gf/why_doesnt_reddit_like_my_bot/
1354482288.0,145zcr,What's the healthiest subreddit? Why?,mpavlofsky,140,36,175,"We talk all the time about the various problems that subreddits face: there are tons of reposts, and there are tons of reposts. But what subreddits handle these problems the best? And how do we measure/grade how well a subreddit is functioning? 

FWIW, and users know instinctively to follow those rules when posting. What do you think the strongest subreddit could be?

EDIT: I think the best way to describe my question is ""Which subreddit should have a ton of problems with moderation and staying on-topic,False,,t5_2rtff,1354488040.0,,,t3_145zcr
1333328774.0,rot0b,A month long experiment has just begun in f7u12: Can the community moderate itself?,squatly,138,38,70,"After having various complaints over and over again about the subjectivity and interpretation of certain rules*

We will let all posts through, apart from advertisements (spam) or personal info - these will still be removed asap.

We will let the community decide what gets (and stays) on the front page.

If the quality of the subreddit increases/stays the same, if at the end of the experiment, the subreddit has deviated substantially from what its purpose is for, we will re-implement our old rules and moderation style.

**rules which were voted in by the community in the first place!*

---

Personally, popular subreddit can/cannot self-regulate, and how much of an impact moderators have on subreddits. 

Hopefully, it may also provide excellent insight to moderators, showing exactly what the community want.

What do you think will result from such an experiment? Do you feel vastly different results would occur in other major subreddits

1325938500.0,o6opz,"So, /r/CIRCLEJERKMILITIA is in the process of raiding /r/atheism. What might, if any be some of the repercussions of a 306 member sub invading one of 400,000 members?",rounder421,36, and I doubt anything will come of it

Am I alone in thinking that [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk) has gone 'full retard' and what may have once been a potent social comment on Reddit's hivemind  tendencies has now become what it once detested and is now even worse than the hivemind itself?

It's fair to say that [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is full of circlejerk tendancies, and that the reason why [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is so hivemind is that they have no other outlet for this type of discussion.

&gt;I wanted to talk to you guys and girls about the direction this subreddit has been heading over the past couple months, 9 times out of 10 they're not breaking any rules, so we just let them stay there. What we need is a good set of rules to help us determine what is ""worthy"" of depthhub, while at the same time not just making up those rules by ourselves. The issue is that what one mod may consider ""unworthy,"" another mod, or even a huge part of our userbase may disagree, and we'd really like to avoid that. 

&gt;So, which is why I'm making this self post.

&gt;Some suggestions that never really got decided on were:

&gt;* Remove posts that had a comment requesting the submission be removed

&gt;* Exclude default reddits.

&gt;* Allow the moderators to use their discretion as to what is appropriate for the subreddit.

&gt;Now those are just a couple, and we just want to make sure we do that in a way that a large number of you support.

&gt;Also, but much more reserved with downvotes. On top of that, to get to the front page of this subreddit, you need less than .1%, which is obviously not a good indicator of what people really want.

##What are the possible ramifications of further integrating social media into reddit?

**Prelude**

Many websites have buttons to share articles and videos on reddit, twitter, etc. However, I have never used one of these buttons and I presume very few people use these buttons on a regular basis. At present, this is the biggest link between reddit and other social media sites.

____________

**Discussion**

Oftentimes

* Forcing reddit accounts to be linked to a facebook profile (extreme)
* Allowing users the option to link social media sites to reddit
* Allowing/forcing reddit users to list information in their profile page*

What are the pros and cons of each of the above options? How would voluntary vs. involuntary social media integration matter?

Recently

* Reddit as a business would make tremendous profit if it was linked with Facebook
* Trolling and hateful comments would likely subside
* It would be easier to identify users engaged in self-promotion (blogspam

Thoughts?

* Name
* Interests

1. Outrage. This is most obvious in r/politics and similar subreddits, conservatives, and corporations. I also think that the ubiquitous existence of &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; is another bit of evidence for the prevalence of outrage as common currency.

2. Nostalgia. I notice this mostly talking about video games as well as movies/TV. It's an easy tactic to call up the positive emotions associated with childhood and to exploit it. Yes

3. Onions. A good sob story will receive lots of attention. This can often be related to outrage

4. Forever Alone. This is related to onions, but crying about Forever Alone-ness is considered emo and less acceptable IRL.

Besides just listing the easily exploited emotions

Personally, so whenever they get sucked into the intensity of a circlejerk emotion, every dissenting comment is interpreted as an attack on the indvidual's right to the feeling he's experiencing. Additionally, because the circlejerk is providing the sense of group solidarity, it will get many of its participants to focus excessive hostility to the perceived threat to its existence.

1357153853.0,15u8ek,TheoryOfReddit's new years resolution: Fill the wiki with quality content!,creesch,127,33,12,"2012 has been a good year where we did see a lot of quality [navel-gazing](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15nobc/best_of_theoryofreddit_2012_winners_and_some/ ""Best of TheoryOfReddit 2012""). 
But due to the nature of reddit a lot of the knowledge gained is easily lost if we are not careful

In order to achieve this we are going to employ a new shiny tool that the admins recently released; the new wiki system.
Since we want this to be a community effort of those most involved we made the wiki editable by any user that has a account older than 90 days and who has accumulated at least 50 subreddit karma. 

So feel free to browse around and if you feel like contributing
One note for people that want to contribute
If you feel like contributing but don't know where to start; the [FAQ page](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/faq) is basically a big list of content waiting to be incorporated into the wiki. 

Some examples of information already in the wiki:
 
* [The reddit glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/glossary)    
* [The BIG list of meta reddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/meta_subreddits) 
* [The BIG list of meta websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/meta_websites) - Example of a page that needs expanding
* [library/What I've Learned from Hacker News](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/library/learned_from_hacker_news)
* [Reddit formatting](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/formating)

Another example what we think requires the collaboration of community is the [subreddit map](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/wiki/subreddit_map) page inspired by a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/15o22t/what_is_the_best_map_for_subreddits/) a few days ago.

With the introduction of the wiki we also added a new subreddit to the TheoryOfReddit family: /r/theoryofwiki the only submissions allowed in here are direct links to wiki pages. We have created this subreddit in order to be able to discuss wiki pages in a organized way. People that can not edit wiki pages yet can still comment here

**Future plans** 

Future plans for the wiki include some external tools that make use of reddit's api. The tags we require under every page are a example of planning ahead
The subreddit map page is something we plan to use as well to create a visual representation of the information on that page.

I think it could show really well what the most active areas of reddit are and how the different subreddits fall into 'cliques' (you could link the subreddits my the number of common members and/or the number of x-posts between them).

Whilst I suspect such a diagram will mostly confirm what we already know

If this hasn't already been done, you'd just need two tables: one with one reddit user per row, and each subreddit they subscribe to in the columns (no usernames or other personal data would be required), and one table listing x-posts - no detail would be needed other than the subreddit the x-post is on, and the subreddit it links to.

I appreciate this might be a lot of data - if there's too much maybe it can be split amongst other redditors and we can each perform analysis on a smaller segment of the data

Update: So after some great discussion I'm going to focus on defining links between subs by looking at the domains in link posts.

What we as users and moderators can do to improve reddit, right now.",,137,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11xji0/distributed_moderation_and_the_future_of_reddit/, when they do take notice they paint the entire community with the same brush.

Let me tell you something: *It's not a good brush.*

The admins have made it clear that reddit is centered around [free speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19975375). Except... when that speech is considered spam... or when it involves personal information... or when it involves the sexualization of minors... OK, do they allow blatant trolls to operate unimpeded in their own subreddits? Subreddits that will continue to attract media attention until one of them is banned for ""threatening the structural integrity of reddit"" and the media is satiated for another six months until the cycle repeats itself again.

I'm not an admin, and let their userbase know exactly how they feel about outside communities attacking our moderators. Hopefully they will explain why they continue to allow vile shock and gore, incest, &amp; rape to thrive unchecked on our website, essentially as troll bait, waiting for the media to stumble upon it.

I'm not an admin... but I am a moderator. I'm involved with [dozens of successful subreddits](http://stattit.com/user/syncretic/), others I rescued and revived via /r/redditrequest (/r/facepalm, /r/Demotivational). Back when I first created the SFWPorn Network, I was told several times by several different people that I was trying to use reddit in a way it was never intended. That I could achieve better results with another service. I'm used to breaking through preconceptions about how reddit works or how it's *supposed* to work. In fact, I [try to do so whenever possible](/r/TheoryOfModeration).

No one can deny that moderation is a highly debated subject here on reddit. More specifically, most redditors will heatedly advocate for one over the other when the subject is broached. We can argue about whether subreddits such as /r/WorldPolitics and /r/TrueReddit are working as intended or not (that would be enough material for an entirely different post), but personally I don't subscribe to laissez-faire moderation. I just don't think it works in my subreddits. I practice active moderation in every subreddit I moderate, this one is no exception. I want to talk about taking active moderation a step further... what I like to call distributed moderation.

Distributed moderation is a school of moderation wherein the number of moderators in a given subreddit is directly tied to the number of subscribers in that subreddit. In /r/TheoryOfReddit,000 as possible. This is usually done in order to keep the moderation duties relatively light per individual mod. In times of high activity (for instance when /r/SubredditDrama or /r/bestof links to the subreddit), there will be an adequate number of moderators online to keep the expected level of moderation constant and unwavering. It also ensures that a large number of active members of the community can have a direct say in matters of subreddit policy, and distributes the power so it doesn't stay in the hands of a select few individuals.

Members of the community need to have more input into how this website is operated. I'm not talking about upvotes and downvotes. Active moderation works because there are rules

Reddit is either top-down, and the mods are left guessing their intentions.

1329410379.0,psgsw,"Trolls; when to ban them, when to ignore them, and why.",,131,290, I think the vast majority of users who we consider to be 'trolls' do not consider themselves to be trolls at all. They simply consider themselves to be users with unpopular opinions

At a certain point, they are no longer simply bringing unpopular opinions to the table, they are antagonizing the subreddit, and can fairly be labeled a troll, even if they don't appreciate that label themselves. I think a few things need to be taken into consideration by a moderator when deciding who is a troll and who is not, and if banning those users will improve the discourse and overall health of the subreddit.

Are they civil

Take a look at their comment history. How do they behave in other subreddits? Do you see a pattern of behavior? Do they make a habit of pushing other users' buttons? Do they consistently get downvoted from subreddit to subreddit? What subreddits do they normally frequent? Do they have a 'reputation' of trolling elsewhere? In my opinion it is very easy to spot a troll vs. a regular user who is simply spouting an opinion that most people don't want to hear.

Once you have identified a troll, I disagree with the sentiment overall.

As I said, possibly curse at you in mod mail or try to start a witchhunt elsewhere. They may indeed come back with a throwaway account to show you that your ban is seemingly meaningless. However, at this point, if you simply ignore the throwaway account, nine times out of ten, they will abandon it and return to their original account. They take pride in their accounts the same as we do, and most of them will simply focus their attention elsewhere. Reddit is a big place, well

Personally I have taken a zero tolerance policy on trolling in all of my subreddits, who at last count had created over 100 accounts, will eventually get bored if you ban every one of their accounts the second they step foot in your subreddit with a throwaway for the purpose of circumventing a ban.

It is my personal opinion that banning trolls takes very little effort from the moderation team, and otherwise create mayhem. It takes a minute or two to create a new account; it takes five seconds to open the ban list and add another name to the list. Isn't that much better, in the long run, than allowing these users to troll your subreddit on a daily basis, sometimes for months at a time?

What's their value? Well, it had a total of 2,806 *actual* votes. This was, remember, less than a year ago, well after the Great Digg Migration. In another couple of months, the admins would report that the site had crossed the [billion monthly pageviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fdyyf/reddit_billions_served/) mark.

It's possible that I'm looking at this wrong, was determined by less than 3,000 votes.

That's for starters. Let's compare that link (which, the *total* score (up minus down) for that post is higher than the total number of votes (up plus down) for the last submission we have reliable, unfuzzed numbers on. The difference in their submission time, by the way, is about 4 months.

As luck would have it, you'll see a few from the last 6 months or so mixed in with the top 50, but far more are from 1 or 2 years ago. There's even a [three year old submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/70b2f/is_there_anyone_else_out_there_that_wants_to_see/) with more than twice as many total points as total votes in our most recent unfuzzed stats (and not quite twice as many total points as that example's [final total score](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eadmg/north_korea_has_fired_several_artillery_shells/)\).

There are, and too much ambiguity about those data points to be sure, but these broad points seem to me to suggest that voting practices have *not* kept pace with the large increase in the number of page views Reddit has seen over the past 2 years. Or, put another way, more than three times as many people are visiting the site now as at this time last year, but there doesn't seem to be a comparable increase in the number of votes.

The sensory input of reddit is the redditors who generate content or attach the various content they've received from the internet world (videos, songs, and text). Reddit simply acts as a categorizer and temporary storage unit for this data. Redditors can therefore be likened to individual nerve cells (i.e. of the retina, or within the cochlea) who only somewhat selectively bring data to the appropriate association cortices (subreddits) of the brain. Eventually the reddit hivemind might be upgraded to be able accept other types of input (i.e. tactile), but only if it is adaptive. 

Smaller subreddits are [infrequently] indexed by the larger ones


The cells of the frontal lobe can be represented by the individual lurkers of reddit. These people choose what random posts are to fall into what computational cognitive neuroscientists call the ""attractor basin"" of consious (and unconscious) thought. These ideas are prioritized on a minute to minute basis to exemplify the short term memory component of the hivemind. The deep stimulation comes through the pursuit of more in-depth aspects of reddit (i.e. subreddits and comments)

There are other similarities, we must also come together like we have in the past but now more fundamentally - with the same efficiency and immediate communication as our bodies allow their individual cells/orqans.

Now we have a few questions to ask ourselves; do we want to be a generators or a lurkers? Do we want our brain to be fraught with about 10% NSFW pics or do we want to exist in a mind where it's closer to 50%? Do we want our brain to be mostly pictures or mostly text files? Do we want more pictures of animals or less?

It seems unlikely to me that any default mods would want to take the risk. I make the suggestion only because I think that *is* a solid idea and would likely improve things both for users and mods.\*

The suggestion to ""break it down"" comes as a follow up to [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/vjemc/three_related_recommendations_for_better/c55jnuc?context=1). There

&gt; Once a sub reaches a certain level of activity, but it also becomes difficult to manage in a number of ways. For a reader, it becomes difficult to keep up. The conveyor belt problem intensifies, driving quality down. And despite all of the problems that arise because of its hyperactivity, people hang onto it, if for no other reason than that a superactive subreddit is the biggest soapbox around. Your chances of getting on the front page plummet, but if you luck up and wind up there

So once a sub you mod becomes hyperactive

1. Figure out a rational division of the subjects covered in your sub;

2. Splinter off additional subs according to those divisions;

3. Set up a bot that collates and cross-posts the best scoring submissions from those subs;

4. Set the hyperactive sub to allowed submissions only from approved submitters

5. Update the sidebar with an explanation and links to the splinter subs.

The result is that the hyperactive sub is now a hub for a network of subs. It serves both as a network-specific bestof, while those who just want to read and comment can concentrate on the hub.

This strategy does, at least, a broader distribution of mods. If /r/AskScience were to break off into multiple splinters (say, AskBiology, AskChemistry, AskGeology, and AskPhysics) the network as a whole would likely need more mods than AskScience alone, fewer mods make for more effective decision-making.

Content in the hub (i.e. the original, it already has a professional-grade discussion going.

Moderators have a right to dictate what is or is not allowed in their subreddits. It's at the very core of how subreddits were originally designed and how they still currently function today. Reddit is a free market. If anyone disagrees with the way a subreddit is currently being moderated, and as the population of reddit continues to grow exponentially, it becomes easier and easier to create [new subreddits](/r/newreddits) every day.

I want to make something clear. We are not trying to turn back the clock to some mythical time in the past when everything was perfect and there were no bad submissions. That time has never existed. There have always been memes

The most important thing you can do if you are interested in helping out is browse the front page of /r/pics and use the report feature, if it breaks a rule it *will* be removed.

I posted a concise description of a problem

http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/

That's how /r/ideasfortheadmins should be used. Asking ""What impact would hiding the vote have on voting behavior?"" is not an appropriate suggestion for the administrators.  That is an idea that ""users or moderators"" can entertain and discuss.  Once a consensus has been reached the idea can be posted to /r/ideasfortheadmins and a link to the relevant theoretical discussion here can be added for context when submitting it.  

In-depth discussions about the impact of a theoretical change are rare in that subreddit.  You get ""this has been asked a thousand times, or whatever.  But you don't get the quality discussion you get here.

Furthermore

When I have an idea about reddit, not /r/ideasfortheadmins.  Choosing the audience that you present your ideas to for critical analysis is essential.  You don't go to a technology journal to publish biological breakthroughs, just like you don't bother the admins with so much debate and conjecture that the simple and manageable request is lost in the din.  The place for discussion is here, and the place for well-thought-out *suggestions* is /r/ideasfortheadmins. 

Even the moderators admit the rule is overreaching.  When removing posts that violate this rule they often mention that rephrasing the title would make it appropriate.  Why would we abide such an arbitrary rule that would prohibit a thought-provoking conversation because of a technicality in the phrasing of their question? 

And to address the ""quality or effort of submission"" we can implement some simple rules to address that.  If you don't put forward a theory, the moderator can address the specific quality issues with the submission*.  This is how scientific journals handle quality issues, they have guidelines and they inform you that your submission did not meet their quality guidelines.  Being told that your submission is not wanted here is different than saying that it does not meet the quality guidelines.  Removing a submission for quality reasons and blaming it on the rule about the appropriate subreddit is illogical and a misuse of the rules.

* /r/CasualIAmA: hasn't grown much since /r/IAmA's rule changes made after I took over

* /r/Politicaldiscussion: Hasn't grown much since /r/politics banned the use of self posts. This may be because /r/politics later allowed self posts again

---

Some of my thoughts:

* The ones that have completely failed have been the most controversial, which would lead you to think that plenty of people would subscribe. Is it that people think that by not subscribing, then the mods will undo the change?

* Related to point #1: the posts announcing the new subreddits and attempting to publicize them would not get as many upvotes if it is very controversial. [Here is the post announcing /r/politicaldiscussion: ~560 upvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j1bh2/new_rule_in_rpolitics_regarding_self_posts/). [The post announcing /r/games did about as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/metq6/announcement_rgaming_to_branch_into_two_separate), subscriptions skyrocketed after that. The 2nd part of this, also apparent with these two submissions, is that a post announcing a rule change *AND* a new subreddit is less likely to take off than just a post announcing a new Subreddit. This is one of the reasons that /r/IAmA took off; the post (that I can't find) announced the creation of /r/IAmA, and only had the ""we'll be removing them from /r/Askreddit"" as an afterthought. 

* The /r/games ""persistent problem"" motivator. For this, then that becomes an advertiser for /r/games. Whereas with most of the splits, it is mod-enforced and the ""lower quality"" (in the mind of the mods) content is sent elsewhere, so no one complains about it anymore (unless it is unenforced). However, this doesn't explain why none of /r/Atheism's or /r/Politics' competitor subreddits ever took off; both of those are consistently regarded as poor quality, and yet a branch-off has never had much luck with either.

* Low quality content: the main reason that most of these are created is that the mods of the parent subreddit are trying to get rid of ""lower quality"" content,"" just different from the intended purpose of the parent subreddit. The **clearest** example of this would be the oft-proposed ""IAmA Request"" subreddit. Requests tend to get upvoted, and people like the AMAs that result from requests, but people *constantly* complain about the requests themselves. We still allow requests because we know that no one will subscribe to the request subreddit, but we still want the AMAs that do result from requests. ",,False,t5_2rtff,True

A few exceptions get through here and there. An example from today's front page would be: ""[Here are 27 pro-SOPA major tech companies. Who has the names of other business supporters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nl9e0/here_are_27_prosopa_major_tech_companies_who_has/)"" But even those exceptions get by mostly be appealing to subjects that redditors take as their own

It wasn't always that way. [There was a time](http://web.archive.org/web/20080201153739/http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit) when the AskReddit front page was a more variegated mix of practical advice and topical inquiry in addition to the opinion solicitations. If you take a look at the new queue

First, is an example of low-information crowdsleuthing. What made this instance unique was the large amount of available information, in the form of images captured and posted by witnesses. To suggest that this kind of mass data can exist and that people will ethically refrain from examining it or drawing conclusions is silly. A voluntary ban on crowdsleuthing discussions by websites like reddit is as unlikely to succeed as a voluntary ban on spamming by mail servers. Ain't gonna happen.

So

1) FBB aggregated an enormous amount of data

2) Some of the analysis was very good- in particular the thread that identified the exact placement of the explosive device, useful, and verifiable (i.e. more individuals participating increases the net accuracy)

Weaknesses next:

1) FBB did a terrible job incorporating new data into the existing evidence. Scraping the internet for anything related to the attacks turned up far too many false positives, but other than this late-breaking missing-person conflation, the other innocents were fingered because of overinterpretation of legitimate data.)

2) There was a herd effect in which hypotheses that were already under consideration were overvalidated by discussion, on how much chatter there was about them on various crowdsleuthing forums. The amount of discussion is not the same as the accuracy of discussion!

Its worth pointing out that these are the same mistakes law enforcement and journalism make in similar situations. In fact, sample sizes are huge, and relevance is a bigger problem than accuracy. Put another way, everyone is suspicious- possible every single person in the suspect photo leaked to Fox had a kindergarten teacher named Joyce. Possibly everyone was born on a thursday. Given enough tests of this sort, some ""strange connection"" is likely to emerge, but while accurate, these relationships are totally irrelevant. The externality problem relates directly to how hard it is to be scrupulous about incorporating new data. &lt;b&gt;While a finite set of valid relationships exist between objects in a finite data set

The second problem is less tractable. Although some models of group decisions are extremely accurate (e.g. the Condorcet Jury Model) these depend on independent evaluations of data. Once people are able to discuss their estimates of validity, big problems. There are computational models that can take this into account, to some extent, but not well.

Suggestions for the future:

Since this is going to happen again

1) Maintain a very high index of suspicion for any new photograph, facebook profiles, similar blast sites from other countries, etc. The only time this was done well in FBB was the ""hat analysis."" Every other external photo damaged the validity of the evidence already assembled.

2) Atomize don't synthesize. Individual tags linking a person in one photo to their position in a second should be considered individually. Articles of clothing should be considered separately. ""photo dump"" threads

3) Tag the picture, in one photo, and then there, without a backpack in another photo, is very useful information. Speculating on what that person's overall pattern of movement, or motivation, or identity might be is unverifiable and dangerous. Identify the correlation and move on- there are probably thousands of other data points that need correlated.

4) Let the cops do the copwork. All the big breaks in this case were accomplished by shoe-leather: the hospital interview with Jeff Baumann, the value of computers in data mining isn't data collection but data structuring- the collection still happens the way it always did in the past.

5) Send in the quants. I'm a student, and return both confidence figures for the individual raters and for the collective judgments. The reddit upvote/downvote system seems almost perfectly adapted for this, but some kind of app or practice would probably need to be established in advance- maybe a bot that auto-votes? This isn't a question I can answer in detail.

1372470100.0,1hacm3,Sensationalism and Politics: A Decline in Quality Over in r/news?,,108,27,44,"Hello, sensational, very diverse community. 

That said, I think, is representative of an overwhelming trend of r/news submissions in past months: sensationalized submissions. Notice how the title (""Police pull guns on and arrest UVA student for...purchasing bottled water"") is deliberately eye-catching, including specific, shocking details (""pull guns on"") and an implied opinion (""for ...purchasing bottled water"") which naturally inspire feelings of indignation in the casual reader. Of course, the student wasn't *actually* arrested for purchasing bottled water, because purchasing bottled water is not a crime. This formula of ""Person was Arrested/Fined/Imprisoned for [Not a Crime]"" is absolutely pervasive in r/news. On the front page, eleventh, many of them referencing the exact same story--a Texas teenager who was jailed for an online comment. So

The second trend in r/news submissions is the overtly political post. These posts are related to the sensationalist personal interest pieces in that they both depend on a sort of moral indignation or outrage in the casual reader. Of course, with a wealth of political posts, often just opinion-pieces. On the front page of r/news, there are currently 10 political articles (40% of content, which could definitely be considered normal if not for the startling tendency of almost every article to have an implied or overt political opinion) with half of them being articles relating to the NSA or government surveillance in general. The ones that do focus on the NSA are almost all opinion-driven pieces focused on indicting the American government. Hell, on the right side of the page, in inches-high block letters, leaving little room for dissenting opinion or, included in a post about four months ago (which I found when trying to make sure that this topic hadn't already been discussed on this subreddit): [link](http://i.imgur.com/p2zxW15.png) . At this point

Given such a problem, and the quality of the posts went steadily downhill. But look at r/worldnews: over 3.5 million subscribers, almost five times as many as r/news, and still fairly free from the trend of sensationalized titles and low-quality articles. Could it be that r/news's American focus is leading it to be much more mired in American politics and prone to local personal interest pieces? Is it the fault of the mods for refusing to clamp down on editorialized posts and themselves showing strong political bias and activism in certain issues? Having only been on reddit for about a year, I still must wonder: is this a recent trend or an issue that's been plaguing r/news for years? Is this an extension of the ""activist-redditor"" mindset that compels certain redditors to indulge in the fantasy that they are affecting world events in real life by posting on reddit (see Boston bombing manhunt, SOPA, etc, wherein mainstream news organizations must fill an unlimited time slot with repetitious

As you can probably see, I would love to have a discussion on its particular causes and effects on reddit specifically.

I propose a better measure for popularity of a default sub would be the number of people who unsubscribe.  Defaults don't have the advertising problem that other subs do

For example

I know atheism was taken off the front page for a while, we can compared it to other defaults - similarly sized and not.  Looking at the numbers, most default subs added ~55k new subs in the last 2 weeks.  Politics is a bit lower, TIL is a bit higher. 

You can see [/r/atheism is adding subscribers much more slowly than similarly sized defaults](http://redditlist.com/stats/atheism) (you can also see on the graph, this suggests its default status explains more of its popularity than its subject.  

Of course newer subs will have higher rates of subscriptions because existing members will join up.  For example, my impression is that most new subscribers are new accounts, not existing ones ""discovering"" politics or atheism.  

Do you think this is a reasonable way to evaluate the popularity of default subs?  

----------------------------------

Lets say I haven't made a silly logical mistake here, which ones are most popular?  Here's a list:

**Top 5 Default Subs** (sorted by most new subs

1. /r/funny
2. /r/bestof
3. /r/technology
4. /r/todayilearned
5. /r/pics

**Bottom 5 Default Subs** (sorted from fewest new subs

1. /r/atheism
2. /r/politics
3. /r/blog
4. /r/aww
5. /r/gaming

Interestingly

--------------------------------

\* Going for a least distasteful front page would make it very boring indeed.  Maybe the sub confronts many new accounts with uncomfortable questions, but just).  Very likely, without default, atheism would have still been a large community, though not nearly the size it is now.

If you're unfamiliar with what happened [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u) Karmanaut removed a post about a kid who was the subject of a meme because he felt wasn't interesting enough per the rules.

Now I'm not looking to turn this into a discussion about whether the initial removal was correct or anything about his sockpuppets. I'm only pointing to this as it is a very high profile example of user outrage towards moderators trying to moderate. Which is something that occurs quite frequently and usually involves people calling mods power hungry and nazis.

What I'm curious about is if these constant overreactions to rule enforcement/changes (Im not talking about actual bad/corrupt mods) could have the unintended consequence of actually making moderators care less about what the users think. I think that it's a very distinct possibility. Especially if we see the kind of outrage being directed towards Karmanaut. Why would any human want to put up with that level of abuse?

Which leads me to my next thought, the ultimate deciders of content. I'm in my early 30's so I grew up on an internet where forums didn't have votes at all and moderating was a pretty standard and accepted practice. Is there a way to get the staunchly anti-mod crowd to be more accepting of moderation?

It makes sense; as everyday there are ~~dozens if not~~ hundreds **if not thousands** of new Redditors, and now 5000 seems to be attainable for ""really good"" posts.

This made me wonder if it was possible to calculate some sort of ""adjusted for inflation"" formula to determine truly what any given user's ""best post"" was. Maybe divide the points of a post by the number of users in the sub on the day it was submitted. Or maybe divide the points by the average number of active users that day. I don't know what an accurate way would be.

In a similar note,000 and you had 1,000, you would feel like you were behind. But if everyone had 100 and you have 1000, you would feel ahead. So, by the logic that the value of your karma is based on the relative amount of karma of all users, doesn't it technically *decrease* the value of your own karma when you upvote someone's post? Much like how printing currency without destroying any decreases the value of that particular currency?

I'm not really asking anything in particular

EDIT: I thought some more about it and came to the following conclusion: 

If the total number of upvotes that are given on any given day exceed the number of new users* who join Reddit that day, then the value of karma increases.

*The definition of ""users"" is debatable. Obviously this doesn't include throwaways who technically join all the default subs

I call it TheBoredMan's Theory of Karma Relativity.

Edit 2: For people who are saying I'm wrong, there are 10 users in all of reddit, and they each have 1 karma. So that means that YOU have 1/10 of the karma out there, and you also represent 1/10 of the ""population"" of Reddit. 1/10=1/10. But that night, two more users join reddit.

*User creates bot specifically to target a list of users with abusive replies to every comment they make around reddit. No agreed process yet exists for dealing with this

~~~

Just an update on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/phe2v/whats_tors_opinion_on_harrassing_trollbots/) which was discussing what to do about the CAT_FACT_BOT (and similar) that were picking out users to harass with spam.

CAT_FACT_BOT has now [been deleted](http://www.reddit.com/user/CAT_FACT_BOT)

I know a fair number of people were getting harassed by this bot

Maybe we need a [/r/reportabusivebots](/r/reportabusivebots) subreddit in addition to /r/reportthespammers (they weren't able to help with CAT_FACT_BOT because it's not technically spam). I'm tempted to start one.

**Edit 2**: a user claiming to be the author of the bots has replied

&gt; I am now going to make piles of bots that do random things that are not spam and just found to be annoying

*facepalm*

**Edit 1**:

So I just wanted to mirror the message I've sent to admin hueypriest r.e. user [1637](http://www.reddit.com/user/1637) . I'll post any replies or advice I get back.

&gt;
&gt;- The first was CAT_FACT_BOT (more details at [/r/reportthespammers](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/pb2xc/overview_for_cat_fact_bot/) )
&gt;
&gt;- This went on for two weeks: there was a discussion about it at [/r/theoryofreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/phe2v/whats_tors_opinion_on_harrassing_trollbots/)
&gt;
&gt;- That eventually got blocked
&gt;
&gt;- This user is an [abusive troll](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pjeog/reddit_what_is_the_meanest_thing_you_have_ever/c3pxqtx) deliberately using the Reddit API to annoy users: 
&gt; &gt; ""I created a Reddit bot CAT_FACT_BOT and had it follow around 51 people for 12 days and counting posting cat facts on their comments. wait naw that's not even close to the worst thing I have done...""
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, to tell him his bot was deleted. I got this reply:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; oh no! Something I don't care about and was a old beaten into the ground joke has been deleted off of the Internet I'm so hurt. I really don't give a dam **but I am going mess with u now**.
&gt;
&gt;And that's when BOOM_DICK started :(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if anything can be done to prevent him creating bot accounts &amp; spamming/trolling people he doesn't like
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for reading
&gt;
&gt;Cheers

**Methods** 

I scraped the moderator lists for the 25 subs /u/meneth identified for his analysis of the ""top 25 subreddits"" and developed an edge list to be turned into a network graph, ran a community detection algorithm to colorize the graph, and sized the moderator nodes according to their degree (the number of other moderators in the graph that they're connected to).

Here's the [code](https://gist.github.com/dmarx/5936250) I used to scrape the moderators if anyone wants to extend this analysis to the top 100 or 1000 subs using stattit.com or something like that.

**Results**

Reddit

The largest community is colored orangered and includes 27 mods (57% of the total mods in the shown graph). Of these, maxwellhill, klyde, and qgyh2 are all very strongly connected, so I would consider these users the strongest ""supermod"" clique identified in this analysis. Their little corner of reddit's top 25 is:

It is programmed to take ""snapshots"" of threads

When a meta-subreddit links to a thread the bot creates an album with it's first snapshot. These snapshots contain the following information among more: 

 1. General information for the linked and linking subreddit and submissions (age
 2. Either every comment in the thread or submission if the submission is sufficiently small
 3.  Vote totals on those comments
 4. A list of commenters who's profiles indicate that they are members of the linking subreddit

With all of this information in one album

My two favorite so far areas follows:

**I will be omitting information such as thread name and linking sub from these examples because this is not intended to direct accusations towards meta-subreddits**

I will also be using short term
___
**Horizontal Bars**

Generates two data sets from two snapshots including any significant comment score. This yields a votes profile for the thread and illustrates the trend in how this voting profile is changing. The upper lip represents positive votes and the lower lip represents negative votes. Comments are only included if they exist in both snapshots. 

The blue is the old snapshot and the red is the new snapshot. Where they overlap the bar is purple. Thus red indicates a continuing trend

This is a ""typical"" voting profile. Large upper lip

[Typical Voting Profile](http://i.imgur.com/1YAai.png)

Deviations from this pattern typically indicate something about the thread. More on that later.

___

**Slope Diagram**

^(*These are automatically generated so tags overlap sometimes


So the horizontal bars intentionally give zero context on *what* is getting voted on. I think these slope diagrams are neat because they help recognize how the opinion of the viewing population is changing. Either because they are changing their minds

The bot plots the 10 (or otherwise) most voted on comments

[Here is a typical slope diagram where nothing noteworthy is happening](http://i.imgur.com/iyiWQ.png)

___

**Deviations from these trends**

Where's the fun in any of this? It's when trends get wonky.

[Threads with huge lower lips](http://i.imgur.com/i42QN.png)

It makes you wonder what's being said. Some profiles have way more downvoted posts than upvoted posts. They usually indicate a silly slapfight where everyone in the thread is making a fool of themselves. 

[Here's another thread from /r/creepyPMs](http://i.imgur.com/rRs0O.png)

Notice how weirdly similar the trends are? When the same trend keeps emerging in subreddits

Ok

[This is what it looks like when the voting population's opinion changes](http://i.imgur.com/9VdIr.png)

This particular thread from /r/fitnesscirclejerk was entirely upvoted

[How about a thread that was **30 days old** and got linked?](http://i.imgur.com/3Luba.png)

It's not typical for the vote count in a 30 day old thread to double in the course of 1 day after it got linked. 

Slope diagrams indicate the opinions that are reversing. [Here's a slope diagram where you can really easily tell the opinion of the new voters](http://i.imgur.com/M69A3.png). Again sorry about the overlapping tags

So these are the typical thinks I look for:

* Upvotes vs. Downvotes 

* Reversal or continuation of trends

* Are more upvotes increasing than downvotes decreasing?

* Is the magnitude of new votes congruent with the age of the submission?

I really appreciate any comments or suggestions. This project was originally just to help me teach myself programming. I've had nearly no programming experience prior to this so I needed a way to keep it interesting.

Bot regulation would be more effective if implemented by the administrators

----

To start with

At the moment

As for how to enforce bot flagging

1. Reddit’s servers could detect bots automatically. Formulaic comments or posts are the main clue

2. It could operate in the manner of /r/ReportTheSpammers

3. The bot flag could be assigned automatically if enough users report the bot. Downsides include potential for abuse. Potential for abuse could be lessened by combining option 3 with option 1 and only flagging bots that objectively demonstrate automated behaviour.

I believe there is a limit on the number of accounts a subreddit can ban

**How Perceptions of Anonymity &amp; Audience Affect Massive Online Communities: An Application of Social Information Processing**

*In the past decade, Twitter, and YouTube that comprise millions of users have emerged and their platforms have gained widespread adoption around the world. As users share information with networks of other people, how does the ability to connect with 
thousands or millions of unknown others impact how a user presents aspects of his or herself? Additionally, a massive online community that embraces aspects of anonymous communication, impacts selective self-presentation of those users. The findings show support for certain audience sizes and self-presentation techniques related to particular sociotechnical contexts and affordances of a massive online community.*

EDIT:

*tl;dr*

*Audience size only predicted the tiniest bit of perception of anonymity in a subreddit (but didn't for the front page). Only using a throwaway account was predicted from perceptions of anonymity (but again

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upnau/overly_attached_girlfriend/) was posted around 9am on 7 June (we'll call this ""epoch"") and quickly shot to the front page. It got tons of attention with 20k redditors voting on it, with multiple recaptionings as is seen with any popular meme. Many of these made it to the front page as well showing the community how lucrative it is for karma.  
  
This is the interesting part: other memes come out of the wood-works. It no longer stays confined to the meme itself
4 hours after epoch, a tineye search shows that this picture hadn't been captioned before.~~ 6 hours after epoch, another picture of OAG is captioned, but this one of her with her mouth open looking like a crazy person: hence the title [Insanity Girlfriend](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/uq70y/insanity_girlfriend/) as a spin-off of insanity wolf and OAG.

This isn't confined to just this meme either, a meme entitled [good guy tribal chief](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upo8s/good_guy_tribal_chief/) is captioned with the words ""let me play you the song of my people."" An hour later, [scumbag church](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/upplw/scumbag_church/) is posted with the punchline ""let me play you the song of my steeple"".

Essentially both sites serve the same function— share random bullshit you find on the Internet, to say the least, that Reddit is so male-dominated.

On Reddit, but even then they're averages of those users). Now on Tumblr, all of the content on your newsfeed goes directly through your friends and other people you're following. Content isn't an average of anything; it's hand-picked and completely individualized.* 

Because content syndication on Reddit is all just an average of the user base, but what's always represented is an average of all the voices. On a site like Tumblr, every voice has a small say on your dashboard. To offer an analogy, if you roll a die once, every number 1 through 6 is equally likely (this is how Tumblr works). But if you roll a die 10 times and average the results and present that as your final number, the result will almost always hover around 3 and 4 (this is how Reddit works).

Because Reddit caters to average, but one of the biggest problems with Reddit's method is that Reddit doesn't appeal to marginalized groups whatsoever. For example, I know many a female who have been extremely alienated by this community because Reddit is already majority male and content averages out to represent a male experience. On the flip side, it seems like the majority of Tumblr users are female, in part because those females can create their own little ""safe spaces"" by very carefully controlling who they follow.

Worst of all, well, nobody will get personally offended! That's just an example, though. The main issue isn't with overt things like ""get back in the kitchen, woman"" but subtle things that make marginalized groups uncomfortable. For example, comments that imply that men only want sex and nothing more may be OK to other men but can alienate women, even if it's only unintentional.

Unfortunately I'm not sure what can be done about this. I think the best and perhaps only solution is for Redditors to acknowledge what position they're in, right?

If you hadn't noticed yet, non-default subreddits will be the entire focus of the subreddit from that point forward. This brings a welcome boost in subscribers and traffic to new and struggling subreddits, but what happens when an already volatile community suddenly has a large group of new users who probably don't know the local etiquette and quite possibly don't care to learn? We may be about to find out.

I'd like to talk about /r/SubredditDrama once again. I've been very hesitant to broach this subject in the past, with the recent changes in moderation here, notably the moderation team which has more than doubled in size as well as our policy regarding comment moderation (rule 4), I think we *may* be able to keep this discussion on point. I know that TOR and SRD share a large amount of subscribers (I myself subscribe to *and moderate* both subreddits), and I think our two communities are hopefully mature enough to discuss this topic without the comments section deteriorating into a flame war. If it does, our moderation team should be able to quietly escort the rowdy patrons to the door.

Why am I talking about SRD and /r/bestof in the same post, a significant increase over the usual daily growth of 100-200 users. On the same day, the moderation team announced they were [banning users who repeatedly interfere in linked threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yplap/meta_posting_in_linked_drama_brigading_and_other/) after they have been submitted, which a small portion of the userbase (and a few of the mods) insist is a problem.

* Does /r/SubredditDrama affect the threads it links to, or is this simply a case of a vocal minority making a mountain out of a molehill? If there is a problem, do you think this new policy will have any effect? Furthermore, do you think there will be any unintended consequences?

----------------------------------------------

An Open Letter to Public Relations Firms &amp; Media Who Want to Use Reddit and the Internet

Are you a public relations firm, or entrepreneur who wishes to use Reddit for your gain? If so this post is for you. Let me begin by welcoming you to Reddit... well maybe I should begin by welcoming you to our home. This strange place on the internet, this place that you recognize as a hotspot for information and trends, is something many of us consider to be our home. We come from different backgrounds, socioeconomic groups, races, and ideologies to congregate in a single spot called Reddit. 

Your person or company has sought us out for several reasons: You want to influence us,  and maybe you think you are smart enough to get what you want from us. Your entity sees the possible potential of such a massive person driven machine just sitting here “going to waste”. This is a common and growing trend as corporations and groups do their best to dig their tendrils into online groups that are primarily driven by their communities. Its nothing to be ashamed of because you want influence which turns to profit and power. I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to have a sizable community on the internet to feel warm and fuzzy towards them. The problem we have here is how you go about getting that support from us.

Once upon a time, dare even across the planet, and it would be the talk of the town for days and weeks to come. The Walter Cronkite's of the world were legendary and their word was tantamount to gospel. Fortunately and unfortunately that time is passing for many reasons but most of all I believe it comes down to three main points: The realization that there is a gross exploitation of media for profit, the recognition of ideological parity that is being shoved down our throats, and the common human desire to express ourselves in an honest and truly free way.

Everybody has heard the argument for the first two reasons listed but few focus our essential human desire to express ourselves in an honest and truly free way. It has been seen since before civilization even began: Cave paintings, fireworks, literature, videos, music. All of this is information. Information is consumed, disseminated, regurgitated, taped back together

This sharing, consciously and unconsciously, and no matter what construct we have before us that wants to disseminate information to us we are biologically bound to spread that information ourselves even more. At this time it has resulted in online communities, online voices, of what the internet embodies today. It is truly the embodiment of a biological imperative taken to heights that few have ever dreamed of.

This innate desire

&gt;”This is my rifle. There are many others like it, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.”

Before someone goes out on a limb and mistakes my intentions with this quote let me put your concerns to rest. To me this quote expresses that a “gun” is the extension of a “soldier”. It is no longer a tool that can be discarded but a piece of one's own being. This is what Reddit

These pieces, tomorrow it may be Reddit or it may be another community that has not even formed yet. These communities are not concrete, they are not fixed points. Communities will rise and fall like men have risen and fallen. As we grow this community grows, as we change this community changes, as we die this community dies. So when I say that your efforts to co-op, to control, to manipulate our community are not well taken I make that statement as someone who is personally effected by your action. 

When outside forces come in and do their best to weasel into our communities and sway opinion their favor it is not tolerated. We do not believe that is acceptable. You can have an opinion

To be relevant in any community one must first understand the wants and needs of a community. Think as a decent human being, a public relations win for UPS, and an expression of problems on many consumers' end to a receptive company audience. Essentially Debbie Curtis Magley of UPS not only entered what could be considered a war zone, as someone representing a company that many have had issue with in the past, but left being considered as someone on the upper level of management who actually did their job by allowing for an outlet where customers could vent their frustrations to someone who can actually do something about it. If you haven't yet read the article I'm telling you to open up a new tab and read it. The point here is lost if you can't be bothered to read the article. 

What Debbie Curtis Magley had here was the human touch. There wasn't some hammed up effort by UPS to try to placate an audience so they would shut up and go away. Make no mistake that is exactly what many companies

I know its hard

There's [an item on theAtlantic.com right now](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/02/kim-jong-un-looking-at-things/100237/) containing nothing but a bunch of pictures of Kim Jong Un looking at things. This thing has been posted on /r/funny

But why doesn't/shouldn't reddit allow a person to post it once and tag it, tagged with three distinct tags. 

Changing reddit to use a tagging metaphor would virtualize each reddit.  Most of reddit would look the same

A visit to [/r/pics](/r/pics) would still present all the posts tagged with ""pics"".  A mod on [/r/pics](/r/pics) could still remove a  post if appropriate - it would amount to removing the pics tag from the post.  If the post was still tagged with some other tag

Creating a reddit would still look the same. You'd still need mods.  Subscribing would still work the same. Custom CSS would work the same.

Up/down votes might need to work differently.  Suppose a post is tagged with 2 tags - one belonging to a million+ reddit like [/r/worldnews](/r/worldnews), drowning out any other rva-only posts.  This seems like a solvable problem, though. One way to address it is to just live with it. If that's not possible, then it might be possible to employ some simple algebra to normalize the relative in-reddit rankings. 

Another issue is the headline. On some reddits, /r/worldnews or /r/news).  In others, creativity within the headlines, or exhortation to action is encouraged.  In video reddits, there's a requirement to include the length of the vid in square brackets [43:22]. I don't have a good proposal for how to reconcile this at the moment, beyond - *just tolerate it.  A post's headline must conform to the reddit rules for every tag the posts bears.*  

When someone posts a duplicate link, then their tag gets added to the set of tags.  In this case, again, there's an issue of voting and credit accrual.  I'd propose that only the first poster gets the points, for any post, regardless of which tags he attached to the post.  

The main advantage to tagging would be to interconnect the various reddits

It seems to be the consensus view that subreddits have a tendency to become dominated by image submissions. This domination will not abate anytime soon. It will become stronger over time because the tools to make image content are becoming more accessible

What I propose is a checkbox in each subreddit sidebar labelled ""Include image submissions"". It would be checked by default

It is three-quarters of the way to just giving each subreddit its own image section, giving them some breathing room.

Note that no moderation is required for this to work. And for those that like their subreddit how it was

I'm aware that introducing filtering options has downsides. You want users to downvote stuff, and would be massively outweighed by the benefits.

All in all
crushed by image submissions. There is a lot of angst out there about the domination of certain types of image posts and so I think there is a real demand for something like this.

It's interesting to see reddit take this creative approach towards advertising.  I see it as a probe to see how the community reacts and one that shouldn't meet much (if any) resistance.  It is certainly a good match with reddit's demographics - Simon Pegg and friends.

I would be very interested to see how the RedditGifts exchange fulfillment percentages have changed over the years.  Early on it was about the reddit community and trust.  With volume has come a groundswell of ""I never received my gift"" comments.  How much is the system being gamed today versus in the past?

It seems like the reddit userbase seriously misunderstands the purpose/meaning behind some of reddit's mechanics

Starting with the nsfw tag: Pretty often there is controversy about over-use of the nsfw tag. The issue with that controversy is that for people at work, then they aren't going to run out of material to view, so over-use is just erring on the side of caution. However, the userbase that isn't viewing reddit in public places finds reason to complain about the overuse of the nsfw tag. It doesn't affect them, so why do they protest?

Because of this perceived controversy, or one who is okay with viewing pornography but not gore. People browsing reddit in an airport or a coffee shop who also want to avoid nsfw material also aren't really going to differentiate between the two.

It seems like now that the nsfw tag is established and commonly used

The exception here is when people post 'NSFL' material, for someone in a public area, there isn't much of a difference between nsfw and nsfl material, but some viewers try to avoid nsfl material for personal reasons. I consider that a separate (and maybe legitimate) issue.

I consider this misunderstanding pretty influential in reddit's culture. If tools are introduced and then changed for improper reasons

A bigger issue in how we perceive meaning in reddit tools and features is in how we use upvotes. I'm sure it's established by now that users treat points as something of value rather than as a tool for sorting quality. When we understand why it exists

Now, because their decision shouldn't be guided by either of those. Making you laugh isn't a criteria for an upvote, and being of bad taste might not be a criteria for a downvote.

It is claimed to be a ""place to showcase reddit’s community, but it provides an overview, in a sense. Certainly it will look different in the near and far future.

But what /about represents is an explicit attempt to answer an important question: what exactly *is* Reddit? Ask fifteen Redditors and you will get fifteen responses: some people use Reddit to share memes, to be an engine for organizing communities, rather than any specific community.

But up to now, a competitor to 9gag, and a site not known for quality content. Others view Reddit as a place for, say, trolls and porn and things that might not be the best image to present to others.

So it is unsurprising that this sort of rebranding would happen. But what might the results be? Will it succeed? I suspect it's unlikely to backfire

1: I'm not sure /about is the best way to orient new users. It doesn't give a very good practical idea of what a subreddit is, it would also explain some conventions on Reddit or maybe point the users at the FAQ or /r/help.

In [/r/science](/r/science), newscientist and arstechnica. And as he goes, the subreddit goes, with one notable exception: theatlantic, which is also linked to quite often.

In [/r/technology](/r/technology), but its still mainly blogs that then link back to primary sources. Take the top link, about the google engineer complaining about google. It's not actually a link to the blog post by the Engineer, it's a link to blog on money.cnn.com, where the author of  *that* blog post editorializes and therefore frames the discussion as being more about Larry Page (current google CEO). Larry shows up once, briefly, in the original blog post, which the author ascribes motives to as if it were its own entity. But

1326751234.0,ojuzs,Is /r/politics really as bad as everyone on reddit claims? I don't think it is.,goodbetterbestbested,118,52,83,"I don't think there is much wrong with [/r/politics](/r/politics) as it is right now

1. the discussion on politics is not nearly as invective as people make it out to be
2. people get the impression that /r/politics is extremely combative because people are very sensitive about their political opinions and are unused to having them challenged
3. /r/politics does have a left-wing bias

Let's start with (1), harassment, and generally juvenile behavior:

[Ron Paul Surges in Iowa polls as Newt Gingrich's lead collapses](http://i.imgur.com/TRTTq.png)

[Dear Internet: It's No Longer OK to Not Know How Congress Works](http://i.imgur.com/FipY2.jpg)

[14-Year-Old Girl Calls Out Rick Perry in Iowa on Gays in the Military: ""Why do you want to deny them their freedom when they’re fighting for your rights?""](http://i.imgur.com/jtYoA.jpg)

The top couple pages of all of these threads contain no real combative language or insults, I don't think the incidence is much higher than in other subreddits devoted to discussion of issues, and even if it is somewhat higher, that is to be expected in a political forum and **that is not a sign of some kind of dysfunction. It is merely a sign of the heated arguments political topics tend to produce.**

(2) That brings me to my second point. When you post something in /r/politics, and feel compelled to respond. Some of these people will be less than civil. But most will merely be providing a different point of view.

People inherently don't like to be challenged on deeply-held beliefs. There is a reason for the expression ""don't talk about politics at the dinner table."" It will usually end with heightened tempers, even when, if you step back and compare it to discussions elsewhere on reddit, it's really not all that much worse. It's just really easy to hate on political discussion in our culture generally and feel somehow ""above"" politics by doing so, and reddit is no exception.

And compared to [political forums](http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/*/index) elsewhere on the internet

(3) That brings me to my third point. Reddit is envisioned by its team not just as a content aggregator, but not all community consensus is groupthink or ""circlejerking."" Those are disparaging terms used by people who fall outside the consensus and feel that their viewpoints are not adequately represented.

On a web site like reddit, which appeals to young, cosmopolitan, technologically-savvy types, tends to attract community members who are politically to the left of, say, Rick Perry or Michelle Bachmann**. The political demographics of the world and the structure of reddit just doesn't allow for /r/politics to become some place where every single ideological position has an equally visible say.

And you know what? I'm okay with that. People in /r/politics do not follow reddiquette, that it's hard to imagine a post that would add to the conversation.

Let's also not forget that [/r/politics](/r/politics) doesn't exist in a vacuum. To some extent, and the top comment in the thread (at least sorted by best) is a correction. And let's not ignore the love Ron Paul gets in /r/politics, even though many of his policies are more ""right-wing"" than most Republicans.

**tl;dr—[/r/politics](/r/politics) is not nearly as bad as people on reddit make it out to be and it's probably one of the more civil political discussion boards on the internet. There are features of reddit and human nature that make it ""feel"" more incivil than it really is.**

1326997571.0,onl2u,AutoModerator - a bot for automating straightforward reddit moderation tasks and improving upon the existing spam-filter,Deimorz,84,18,34,"*(edit: for anyone new coming to this post, etc. For an up-to-date list of AutoModerator's current capabilities

**The current issues with reddit moderation**

Possibly the single most significant issue with moderating on reddit is that we don't really have *moderation* tools. We have *anti-spam* tools (and very limited ones), their subreddit's automatic filter tries to ""learn"" from that, and changes its behavior a little towards future posts from that user/domain, or with similar words in the title.

This is especially problematic when applied to sites that allow user uploads, which should be removed. But by doing this, you cause the spam-filter to increase its bias against *all* future submissions from youtube, on-topic or not. So now it's more likely that youtube submissions will start being filtered, and a moderator will have to watch the spam queue and approve legitimate ones. Removing that submission also adds a fairly strong bias against the submitter, and even if it was an honest mistake or had to be removed for some reason despite being a valid submission, it becomes quite likely that all future submissions by that user will be filtered.

This is basically a never-ending battle, they'll already be pushed far down the new page and will receive much less attention. So to have a ""well-moderated"" subreddit, you generally need extremely active moderators that can be checking the new page (for spam/offtopic/rule-breaking posts), the spam page (for incorrectly-filtered legitimate posts), and the reports page and mod-mail very regularly. Note that this activity is not really ""moderating"" a lot of the time, it's just being there to correct constant incorrect decisions by the automatic filter.

**Automating the job**

Most of these ""corrections"" that a moderator has to make are extremely straightforward. Check the domain, etc. So about a week ago, I started building a bot that could be could be configured with ""conditional actions"", where it would watch these important pages, apply the defined conditions to any new submissions, and perform actions if the conditions were met. It's been functional for the last few days, and is currently being used in 7 subreddits, with each subreddit having its own conditional actions

* The domain and full URL of the submission (which includes determining if a post is a link or self-post)
* The submission's title
* The submitter's name, and whether they have reddit gold
* The text of a comment (currently
* Which specific meme a post is

All of these conditions can be defined using [regular expressions](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Regular_expressions), where anything *not* satisfying the condition will be removed/approved.

This allows for many capabilities that are currently impossible

* Completely banning domains - e.g. /r/gaming doesn't allow URL-shorteners
* Removing ""suspicious"" domains from new users, but allowed if older users submit it.
* Restricting domains/titles for subreddits with strict submission rules - e.g. /r/bestof has a constant problem with people submitting from domains other than reddit.com, and anything matching approved (spammers usually don't try to follow the rules).
* Auto-approving submissions that are ""probably fine"" - e.g. if a user has a decent account age and at least a small amount of karma
* Approve *everything* - e.g. subreddits that are low-traffic that really don't worry about spam
* Removing reported comments containing certain text - e.g. there's an ongoing issue in the default subreddits with a persistent troll that spams ""shock"" images in replies to the top comments of the top submissions. AutoModerator now removes those immediately when they're reported in /r/gaming.

And so on, a large chunk of the moderating work of a subreddit can be handled. Since implementing it in /r/gaming, the amount of human moderation needed has dropped drastically. In less than 4 days in /r/Music, it's let 238 submissions through the spam-filter, which previously would have had to be done manually.

**Resistance to use and future plans**

One thing I'm finding interesting so far is that when I've offered use of AutoModerator to various subreddits, but where you can actually define conditions instead of just giving vague hints and hoping it works. Its decisions can always be overridden, just like the existing filter, but with no side-effects.

I think one factor of this is a feeling of a lack of control - currently the way to modify conditions for your subreddit is ""message Deimorz"", so that people are able to run their own instances if they don't want to trust me, or just confirm what exactly it does.

I also have a few more functions that I'm hoping to add very soon, ~80% of the ""please unfilter my post"" mod-mail now has already been approved by the bot before one of us gets to it, would be nice to know it did it), and having the bot send a mod-mail to a subreddit if any posts get above a ""probably actually a problem"" threshold for reports. *(edit: [all of these functions have been implemented](https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator/wiki/))*

1373520354.0,1i29s8,The Difference in Click to Karma Ratio Between SubReddits,zaron5551,83,21,15,"This is something I've been thinking about for a while, at least that's what I've always kinda assumed. But my experience has shown that not to be necessarily true. I would add that it seems especially plausible considering they're both images.

Now

Things worth noting: First, the image has a pretty major flaw; zoom in on that and you'll see hot air balloons. I fixed it later, but not for a few months. Third, it got ~40,000 views in the first 3-4 days. It has a few more now, but still about that many: http://i.imgur.com/nSK72X0.png

Let's compare that to my more recent /r/quotesporn image: http://np.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/1hqaqa/our_generation_chuck_palahniuk_2560x1440oc/

Things worth noting: quotesporn has ~140, book, and movie on reddit. Third, it has 9,000 views: http://i.imgur.com/vSEAnK9.png

What gives? 

I can think of think of three possible reasons for the disparity in karma/clicks, but of course there are downvotes to consider too, so 42000/879 total votes = 47.78 views/vote. Compare that to 9000/~1000=~9 views/votes or 9000/~1800= 5 views/vote. (I used approxomations on that one becasue it's so recent, but I actually would get a lower view/vote ratio if I used the numbers I saw). So, we have between 7-9 times difference in the ratio on these two posts. 

I have a control to quickly consider before I finish I'll offer my explanation. This post http://np.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1f01k1/the_kids_are_alright/ garnered 49 total votes and ~9000 views so 9000/49=183; wildly different, but I intend on doing another test, well really just obsessively checking numbers on things I post, but still, I expect I'll have more data relatively soon.

How do I explain this disparity:

1. I sometimes feel like imgur might have changed the way they calculates views or imgur may just be poor at recording them; after all

2. The quote I posted, I may have just been me stumbling into an accidental karmawhore niche. 

3. /r/wallpapers is crawled by outside sites in a way /r/QuotesPorn isn't. I know of redditlurker and I'm pretty sure I've run into a couple other sites that post links to my wallpapers from reddit. I assume this is the biggest factor

1370877186.0,1g1que,"How to address controversial moderation changes using the ""feetback"" method.",blackstar9000,131,65,80,"## The Problem

Recent events in /r\/atheism serve as a reminder of how difficult it can be to use Reddit's native systems to moderate in accordance with the will of community standard. Put briefly

1. **Pseudo-anonymity**—Reliable votes are linked to stable, there's no reliable way to ensure the necessary ideal of ""one person, one vote."" Admins could, in principle, tie votes back to IP addresses, but even that method could be circumvented (using TOR, for example), anyway
2. **Lack of an agreed-upon criteria for eligibility**—In short, which is normally tied to geography. If you've lived in an area long enough, you have the right to vote. If you don't live in a particular area, you can't vote there. That standard doesn't entirely work on Reddit because there is no real analogue to citizenship when it comes to individual subs. Should only subscribers be allowed to vote? What about users that aren't subscribed, but routinely submit to, vote in, and read a sub as much as, many of its subscribers? What about former subscribers who unsubbed because there was no prior recourse for the very issue currently under review?
3. **Methodological issues**—Put simply, which could be used to determine whether or not a vote was likely to be representative of the entire community. Attempts to implement other methods of vote collection have likewise proven problematic.
4. **Self-selection bias**—Controversial policy changes will tend to draw out the opposition in greater numbers than supporters

Some have suggested random sampling as a method for reliable polling, it's unlikely that a PM poll will win acceptance unless handled by a mutually trusted independent auditor.

----

## The ""Feetback"" Method

In thinking about these things, signaling disapproval by abandoning a venue—I'm calling it the ""feetback"" method. Also, the word amuses me. The idea is to structure the moderation team's response to controversy by converting the community's response into a trackable metric.

Before I explain

1. *The method is not meant to work as the first recourse for policy changes.* Rather, disaster management.
2. *The method is not meant to be genuinely democratic.* That is to say
3. *Risk is an innate part of the method.* What are the risks? I'll get to that in the next paragraph. Why would anyone want to incur those risks? See caveat #1.

With that out of the way, at the end of a month and according to a specific and measurable criteria, the policy has significantly damaged the health of the subreddit.** That can be gauged using the following steps:

1. *Decide on a criteria.* This will likely vary depending on the circumstances, the criteria I'd suggest is a combination of *average pageviews by week* and *average uniques by week*. In other words, if either stat falls below 66% of the pre-policy-change average, or both below 75%, the policy is a failure and the mods agree to hand the sub over to new mods. The initial average needs to be calculated in advance—if there are no older records of weekly averages, this can be done by calculating weekly averages from the available monthly totals.
2.*Appoint an independent auditor.* This should be someone who is reasonably trusted by both sides of the debate. It can even be a bot, they must be made a moderator (with limited mod powers, of course) and given the ability to view the traffic stats.
4. *Let the trial run its course.* Set a date for one month from the announcement of the trial. Run the subreddit according to the new policies. At the end of the trial period, since the initial opposition of earlier weeks may skew the results. Let the auditor verify the results. If the trial has failed, abide by the agreement to hand the sub over to new mods.

If handled correctly

---

## But what's to stop the opposition from interfering with the trial?

For example

The feetback method discourages that kind of disruptive strategy by the judicious selection of a criteria for determining the health of the affected sub. In other words

If you'd like to see the raw results
***
In total, 62 (12%) were female, and 9 (2%) were unsure or ""Other"".

At the time the survey was closed, somewhere around 50% of the total voting population and a significantly higher chunk of the total commenting population responded, although those figures are mere speculation and are subject to debate.
***
Of the 525 subscribers who responded, and 185 (35%) responding with 2-4 hours a day. Approximately 1/3 of subscribers (176 respondants) report operating more than one reddit account. Based on this data, we can conclude that /r/TheoryOfReddit is comprised of dedicated users (a hardly groundbreaking assumption; I would bet most of us are here *because* we are dedicated redditors).

Only 57 (11%) of respondants reported moderating at least one ""Large"" subreddit (more than 500 subscribers). Although it is not certain from these results how many moderators in general there are

Concerning academic studies:

338 subscribers reported currently being students; the remaining 187 subscribers are either no longer students or are students who work full-time. Of the students, 175 towards a four-year degree, 29 towards a master's degree, and 14 towards their doctorate (note: this is not entirely accurate on an international level, considering many countries differ from the United States in this regard).

144 subscribers (27%) reported having no major, garnering 75 (14%) of the total responses. 44 (8%) responded with some sort of engineering. Another 44 responded as majoring in some science (physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences, etc.). 102 (19%) of subscribers reported some kind of social science (economics, history, psychology, art, 16 studied math

The ""Levels of Interest"" questions can be easily examined from [this nifty series of charts provided by google](http://i.imgur.com/yASBv.png). In brief: most of the subject areas mentioned in the survey had a simple majority indicating ""Interested"" or ""Highly Interested"". The more heavily-skewed towards the positive side included Computer Science/Information Technology, Psychology, Music, Philosophy, and Logic. The more negatively-skewed topics included Art, Archaeology, Communications/Mass Communications, and Preforming Arts. 20% of subscribers are ""Highly Uninterested"" in Wumbology and presumably hate Spongebob

Finally, but as I said earlier, real life caught up with me, and trying to analyze that data turned into a bigger task than I had time for (and the main reason this post was delayed so long). However, one thing I took note of was the number of responses that indicated an alternative to a default subreddit (e.g. /r/games as opposed to /r/gaming, /r/photography as opposed to /r/pics).

2. Do moderators have expectation of privacy in mod mail?

My argument follows

(1) Users should expect that their mod mail messages will *always* be kept private

The main reason is similar to why reporting is anonymous. To protect whistleblowers and complaints about other users. People will be more willing to reveal information to the moderators if they trusted that it would be kept private. There are also other obvious cases, informing the mods about serious violations (to make their report more meaningful), and others.

Now, and it's easier for the users to assume the same standards in all subreddits.

(2) Moderators should assume that whatever they say in mod mail is public, you no longer have any expectation of privacy.

The major change is that the Fader is now rendered using a table rather than a list. That allowed me to put in some Unicode arrows in the margins at either side, make the function of the Fader more intuitive for the uninitiated.

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit improve the selection of which posts to show users first?

**Discussion**  
  
The public face of reddit is the mixed reddit.com frontpage, be improved? A few ideas to start us off :

*  *Weighting by domain / file type.*  
  
In subreddits with mixed content of discussions and links
  
One idea is that all votes do not have to be equal. A mod-team could set a weighting system based on the linked address and/or by the linked file-type. For example
  
The rule-set for vote weighting should probably be made public for every subreddit. Circumventing the system by using forwarding URLs is already covered by existing common rules against using link-shortening services. 

*  *Ranking normalised for time of day.*  
  
The first hour of a post's life on reddit is crucial to breaking into /hot. Posts posted at a quiet time of day can vanish without trace
  
This could be mitigated by referencing the number of users active at the time of the post, it will climb higher than a post that gets 50 votes when 3000 users are online.

*  *Crowdsourced post / subreddit discovery.*

[Last.fm](http://last.fm) works on a very effective system of recommending music based on what other users with similar listening habits also like. Reddit could further personalise the front page, if I always upvote posts from a certain set of blogs, it's likely that there are other fans on reddit behaving similarly. With the new social discovery system, reddit would place greater weighting on their votes when building my personal front page, and even suggest posts they like from subreddits I'm not subscribed to.  

This would have to be an opt-in system to avoid privacy concerns

Please let us know what you feel works and doesn't work with the current ranking system.",,t5_2rtff,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1j0z2r/admin_level_change_thought_experiment_week_04/

-------------------------------------------

Longwinded bullshit:

Reddit is one of the biggest single organs of discussion and deliberation on the web. It is also completely moderated by volunteers. Are some skilled ones doing all the work? Do moderators looking to recruit new moderators draw from people they've already worked with

###Data:

By asking reddit.com admin Deimorz nicely, 20761 subreddits, for a total of 59139 nodes and 653541 edges. It's not the entire data set: when I crawled for subscribers I got like 300000 subreddits, but Deimorz has said it's probably from stattit, so it's only subreddits that were once in the top 5000. Also it's like three months old.

###Procedure:

 1. I cleaned the data set (moderators.csv), so that I could add an attribute (bipartite) to the nodes, which makes it easier to make projections in NetworkX.

 2. Opened a new gephi project file. Went to ""Data Laboratory"" and used ""Import Spreadsheet"" to import the nodes first

 3. I wanted to split this into two projections, ""networkxprojection.py"". (I originally planned to use the Gephi multimodal networks plugin, but it was very memory-inefficient and this network is big.) My script spits out two unweighted networks and two weighted ones in gml format, I basically just used the weighted ones. The weights are simple and not normalized. It also spits out some average degree measurements for each class, which are hard to do in gephi.

 4. Now that I had these projected gmls, then partitioned by modularity class, layout by ForceAtlas2, calculated average path length (takes forever), sized nodes by # subscribers, and checked out the huge connected component, etc.


###Results:

##Original graph:

[Both in the same graph](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displayboth/index.html)

The original moderator and subreddits graph shows a large connected component and a belt of disconnected small cliques. The average degree displayed in Gephi is misleading, SFWporn, and celebrity worship. The fempire and other networks are also visible.

| Metric | Result (w/ Automod) | Result (w/o automod)|
|:-------|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
|Size of giant connected component | 50.56% of nodes |49.63% of nodes (549 fewer nodes)
|Largest detected module | 4.51% of nodes | 4.04% of nodes 
|Average shortest path | 8.994 | 9.747 
|Network diameter |33| 33
|Avg. subreddits moderated per moderator |These were incorrect |1.642
|Avg. moderators per subreddit |So I removed them |3.035
|Modularity |0.928 |0.933

##Moderators:

[Moderators mapped by shared subreddits network.](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displaymods/index.html) 

The modules are clearer in the projection of moderators that share subreddits. There are again many big cliques that kind of stand out, and a somewhat separate community made up of mods of subreddits which satirize reddit, e.g. /r/circlejerk, /r/braveryjerk, etc. There are a number of very high degree hubs in this network. Some are special users such as AutoModerator, a moderator python bot which performs menial tasks and which anyone can add to their subreddit and be benefited by, and which may have confounded community finding. Others appear to be simply very active users.


|Metric | Result (w/ Automod) |Result (w/o Automod)|
|:------|:--------------------------|:---------------------|
|Size of giant connected component| 51.88% of nodes| 50.75% of nodes
|Largest detected module |9.25% of nodes| 8.38% of nodes
|Average shortest path |4.72 |5.104
|Network diameter |16 |16
|Avg. unweighted degree |9.956 |9.854
|Avg. weighted degree |12.302 |12.157
|Modularity| 0.841| 0.847
|Average Clustering Coefficient| 0.895| 0.894



##Subreddits:

[Subreddits mapped by shared moderators network.](http://tz18.github.io/interlockingmoderatorship/displaysubs/index.html) 

Visualization of the graph of subreddits shows five clear modules of subreddits: satire of reddit, SFWporn (high resolution pictures of cars and rocks and stuff). Then there is a big clump of random relatively normal, unrelated stuff, which I'm going to guess is connected by AutoModerator and thus perhaps should be ignored..

|Metric|Result (w/ automod)|Result (w/o automod)|
|:------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
|Size of giant connected component|48.45%|47.56%
|Largest detected module|10.94%|12.59%
|Average shortest path|4.058|4.416

|Avg. weighted degree|47.008|34.008

###Conclusion:

I think that my analysis did provide new insights. Community analysis of subreddits found that there are at least four general categories of subject matter have prompted the creation of many specific subreddits moderated by the same people: celebrity worship, and pornography. Looking at the projected graph of moderators, we found that there are in fact many high-degree hub users. And our layout of the graph of moderators and partition by modularity-determined community showed that there are two large communities of moderators: mainstream redditors, and those that make fun of them.

Qualitatively analyzing the various states of minds that make up the frontpage hivemind.,GuntripAnalysis,96,36,28,"I do not know how to code but im ok with statistics and spss so perhaps acquiring this data is possible? Hang with me for a sec. 

This is for all of the default subreddits. And this example here just utilizes some of the simpler variables I could think of. 

A magical robot inside the internet grabs all the posts amongst all these subreddits and searches for word X. It then pumps out some data. 

Some simple examples:

First proportion would be a comparing (total number of times when X was said) with (total number of times a word was said 
[all words]) in the subreddits with one another.  Adjustments would be made based on total number of users. That gives us some information.

Another proportion would be comparing (how often a user said X) with (how many users are subscribed [and/ or active users) in the subs with one another. That could give us some more information. 

There needs to be a lot


Here are variables I am interested in playing around with:

* Average number of words per day on subreddit
* Average number of posts per day
* Average number of unique posts per day
**** How often these subreddits posted in? (can scale this one baby)
****Total number of subscribers (scaled)

And a bunch more. 

I think this would be a possible way to see into the hivemind. 

Could a magical robot/bot be developed to obtain these variables? If so I can punch some statistics into it and a whole bunch of interesting numbers would come out of it which we could try and interpret.  

I hope this makes sense so please ask if you have any questions about what I am interested in. I'm thinking Worf hypothesis (or linguistic relativity

To give you an idea of the variance between the two accounts, I can see 15 images that are memes/screen shots and that count is on the lower end of the range. There have been plenty of times where I've seen 20+ of the 25 links as images.

Also, stopping karma for links to images (fairly easy to configure because only 4-5 websites can handle Reddit traffic at the moment; you should add imgur.com to your filter in RES and watch how the frontpage of /all/ just loses 95% of the posts) are ignored by all the admins and none of them want to comment on anything that is related to karma. Why not? Are they afraid that when people need to do some effort to gain karma that they will just leave to another website?

When I saw the idea of the college contest I immediately thought about what for cheap form of marketing it is. A lot of people were cheering in arms for this contest but if you just look at the idea

Also, the admins take action because of the ""bad behaviour"" of those mods. I have some sort of feeling that they just saw an opportunity to ban a subreddit that was controversial and could harm the image of Reddit and lose advertisers (you don't want your product linked to jailbait).

Another thing is that the admins claim to censor a lot of advertisements like no sound advertisements, [Get your adsense account approved...](http://www.reddit.com/comments/jltwx/get_your_adsense_account_approval_must_read_the/),...) and when their is an uproar about an advertisement the admins come out quickly, apologize

Reddit also HEAVILY relies on good caching in order to keep the load at a minimum. Anyone that knows how caching works knows that more popular content is more easily cached

Therefore, the higher the load will be per hit. This would seem to give the admins reason to want people to stay within the default subreddits and reduce their desire to improve subreddit discovery to a point.

1) Is this possibly one of the reasons why the admins are seem so reluctant to make changes that will assist with subreddit discovery? 

2) Is this possibly why Reddit wants more funding? I feel like their revenue is now growing appropriately OR faster than the number of page visits are. It's a matter of each hit getting cheaper and cheaper as the scale grows larger (the internet is certainly one of the best examples of economies of scale). 

So it doesn't seem to make sense that Reddit needs more funding per hit now than they did before.

I'm not calling it an conspiracy, I'm thinking that subreddit discovery is actually an ""expensive feature"" and is purposefully being avoided to some degree.

Reddit has numerous irreconcilable political factions

Here is are some of the steps I would expect in this devolution of dialogue:

1) Straw man opponent arguments overtly

2) Covertly sock-puppet the adversary / Poe's Law.

3) Upvote the opponent's lowest common denominator content (opinions

4) Also embody the opponent's lowest common denominator user as as if you are a part of their invading down-vote brigade


I would imagine this behavior is already occurring

So one of the things I'm really interested in is information control. I'll preface this by saying that I'm not actively censoring anything (on the contrary, but psyops is the most fascinating part of warfare for me and I love anything to do with propaganda. 

**Actual content time!** I mod a subreddit called /r/fifthworldproblems, so that's dancing in a minefield as far as trying to keep any sense of coherency is concerned. 

Directly telling people what they can and cannot post is not something I'm okay with

To that end, causing our population to jump from 50 to 5000 in a matter of weeks and causing content stagnation almost instantly), using CSS edits to passively control the flow of information. It's all experimental and none of it is particularly conclusive yet, but what I already have is worth checking out and it carries some big implications both good and bad.

BUT HAPPYBLAJUR

----

It's a dirty word

- Reinforce or change a subreddit's image. ""Ents"" in /r/trees are an example of this. By rebranding the ""stoner"" image and giving it a positive makeover (happy, the ents built an empire on this website and they did it through basic propaganda. 

- Mobilise manpower and resources for specific causes. A few months ago, it was ""Let's beat the Christians"". Using an enemy's progress to further your own agenda, basic propaganda. 

- Destroy communities. Consider SRS and the recent ephebophile scandal. In a matter of a few days, and then completely lock down rival sentiment by declaring anyone who sided with the ephebophiles as a paedo-sympathiser. Overnight they had raised an issue, neutered the opposition, and pressured Reddit with the same scalpel to deliver the coup de grace while enriching their own position as morality police rather than a moralist circlejerk. Basic, brilliant propaganda. 

- Control the direction of content. Let's say you run /r/politics and you think there's too much conservative content getting through. Removing it silently is bound to be noticed by both the submitters and the other moderators. Outright saying ""This is a liberal subreddit"" will result in your head on a pike after the ensuing shitstorm blows over. Mobilising the leftist base through controlling what they see makes a goldstein of the conservatives and sends them running. I can't think of many good examples of this

With a subreddit as esoteric as fifthworldproblems, quality posts which drive new people to the subreddit. You want these people, you want to maximise that number. 

The bulk of your membership isn't creative, even if it means being smashed, just because movement is fun and they like to have fun. These are your parrots, and you can feed them into the former group by seeding them with creative cues to build off of. 

Then there's the shitposter minority, just use them to fill seats and hope the law of averages works in your favour. 

Propaganda targets the middle group. The creators will continue to post as long as they're recognised for it

1320923918.0,m7b2u,"Advice for Topical or Subject-based subreddits, and changing from ""all"" to ""text-only"" submissions, based on the experience at /r/fitness",menuitem,80,13, I describe that the behavior known as ""karma-whoring"" may be directly related to the size of the subreddit subscriber base.  I propose that topic or subject-centered subreddits wishing to avoid ""karma-whoring"" should change from a ""links and text-based"" subreddit to a ""text-only"" subreddit

On July 1, changing from the previous default setting of 'all' (links and text), which subsequently was made permanent.  This trial was initiated after  mod-led threads on the direction of the subreddit over the previous half year. 

In January 2011, quickly reaching 70,000 subscribers in the Feb-March period (these numbers may not be accurate: I'm recalling them from memory, and have no documentation about the precise numbers), with the growth largely flattening out by early April.  The number of unique impressions increased from about 800K in December 2010, to well over 3M in March 2010.  We think this was related to fittit being advertised on the front page by the admins, and perhaps also related to the subreddit being nominated as ""best community"" or somesuch.  Anyhow

Prior to, fitness is about being in a physical and mental condition to accomplish desired tasks -- sports, or daily work, or even just living life and feeling good about it.  Thus, fitness as discussed on the subreddit usually involves a basic weight-training program (which includes weight programming, proper diet, and rest), and then it expands into sports-related applications

Whether subreddits are discussion boards (topic-based discussion) or communities (human-based social interaction) is really just a summative description of how the board actually behaves.  Based on what I've seen on fittit, and this is an important point: more and more people come to the board in order to participate in emotional (as opposed to informational) exchanges.   They like to see posts which re-inforce their ideas, entertain them, brighten their day -- and the shorter the post is (low time investment), the more they like it.  

Now, when such interactions make up a small fraction (I will say, &lt;5%) of the group interactions.  If you've ever belonged to a goal-oriented group, it helps to have someone cut-up every now and then, throw a joke out there, relieve tension, make everyone feel human. 

On the other hand, upset, and eventually wander off. 

Thus, I stress that the 'karma-whoring' designation, though it may sound contrary, is not intended as a value-laden condemnation. It is merely and only a common description for behavior which is widely known and recognized.*).  

Because of this, and that is how they see the board.  However, it slowly became a community-based board, and the daily top posts would be pictures which elicit laughs, and not useful discussion about fitness. 

To many redditors, this is a huge problem, because none of them are involved for yuks, shits and giggles: they're there for useful discussion.  This creates a conflict between the many redditors who like reddit in its 'default' base (where links and self-posts are permitted) and visit largely for the yuks, and the moderators (and many other users) who suddenly see the content-based board over-run with karma-whoring images. 

To the moderators, and bringing in new members who are largely image-yuks oriented. 

This led to discussion, we saw stronger blowback.  However, the arguments against were largely about power (""you have no right!"") and not convincingly substantive (such as ""/r/fitness"" is better with all the pictures!). The test period of one month proceeded. 

After the test period, and some of those fell in the category of ""motivators"", which is basically where ""karma-whoring"" style posts went before).  But the qualitative response of both the mods and the users was very strongly positive.  The users who stayed for the full month liked it. 

I want to stress this point here: quantitatively, they gain no karma for their poster, and qualitatively, they were less aimed at raw yuks than actually addressing the fitness topic. As a result, the perception of everyone was that the board was much improved by the change to text-only.  **The complaint that we often heard before was that the switch to 'text-only' was to drive out the karma-whoring images; the switch did not do this, but the perception of those images which were submitted was that they were of much higher quality, much more on topic

Since that time -- and since May 2011 -- the subscriber base has largely grown linearly, and has been largely constant since then, except for a ~15% dip which hit in September (perhaps due to school re-starting).  Thus, the change to text-only did not significantly decrease either subscriptions or traffic compared to the trends prior to the change. 

**Conclusions**

* A topical or subject-based subreddit of size &lt;20K subscribers is largely focussed on the subject at hand. However, as
such images remain &lt;5% of the total posts
* At a subreddit size of approximately 40K-50K subscribers
* By the time a subreddit reaches 70K subscribers
* In conclusion, with the goal in mind of maintaining a topical- or subject-based discussion in the subreddit.

1376088879.0,1k2291,Admin Level Change Thought Experiment Week 06: What if mods had more tools similar to other Internet forums?,creesch,88,25,51,"*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week

Here is this week's topic:

## What if mods had more tools similar to other Internet forums?

**Prelude**

This week the admins introduced some new functionality for moderators to use for managing subreddits: [sticky posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/). It was generally positively received among the moderator community as a great new thing to be used within their communities. This is somewhat odd since sticky posts have been around for a very long time on the internet

____________

**Discussion**

Reddit was traditionally a website where people could submit links and vote on them

However there are many things available to ordinary forum moderators that are not available to moderators on reddit. A few examples of things available in modern forum software: 

- Locking posts so people can't comment in them anymore. 
- ~~Make posts sticky~~ Make multiple posts sticky. 
- Truly deleting posts
- Tag users/user notes. 
- Edit titles. 
- Merge posts. 
- Splitting off a topic.
- Filter out posts or comments based on keywords. 
- Set the subreddit to ""approved posts only"".
- Move a post to another subreddit. 
- User permission system
- Duplicate thread prevention (suggestion of similar threads when a user posts something) 
- A truly central moderation control panel. There are several areas that try to fill in that function to some degrees but many aspects are scattered around the place and take you to fastly different pages. 
- Inline moderation
- Scheduled/delayed moderation
- Removal reasons. 
- User warnings
- User point system
  - View warning logs. 
- Automatic actions against potential troublemakers
- Filter the moderation log on actions taken on a user.

The above list contains items that certainly are possible with third part tools right now (automoderator
So while some of tools on the above list are available they are not by any means ideal since they are add ons and not integrated in reddit itself.

So what are your thoughts on this? Would these (or other unlisted) features be beneficial for moderators? How should they be implemented and to what degree? How would they affect reddit if they were implemented?

The result is the establishment of Invisible Children's story as the actual truth

Now a whole message has been hijacked, ""well, what have **you** done?"" or told ""at least they're doing *something.*"" We care more about Invisible Children's good intentions than their actual methods. We care more about the organization than the people it's claiming to help. 

In fact the only criticism that seems to matter is that [Invisible Children only spends 30something percent of its revenues on charity work](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/qkxvm/kony_2012/).

**introductory remarks:** With power comes responsibility. Moderating a default is a huge responsibility. However

**Reddit is not unique.** Online forums have existed in one form or another for 15+ years. People have learned a lot of lessons over that period of time

**Defining moderation:** Moderation is the most powerful tool for influencing how a large community behaves. Let’s start with the basics. Moderation is the act of managing the community by going through its content and ensuring that it complies with either the rules or ideals of the forum. Moderation is not simply deleting spam

**Reddit is heavily under-moderated.** Almost every large sub on reddit is heavily under-moderated; a lot of content is never moderated at all. There simply aren't enough mods to actually go over every piece of content in a timely fashion.  That leads to a simple conclusion: if you have an interest in increasing the quality of your sub

**No change in current policy** Already, the sub belonging to the community in virtue of being a default and probably many others. Let’s just concern ourselves with removing spamming, trolling, completely off-topic content and single-word replies that add nothing to discussion. This implies no change in any policy on specific subs, simply executing the rules that are currently instated. Hands-off moderation does not work in practice. /r/atheism is the perfect example of that. Communities are not capable of self-moderation, even with an upvote/downvote system, in here that’s just preaching to the choir. Anyone who's led a large forum agrees. These things need to be removed if you want to improve quality

**A timely fashion is maybe 10-15 minutes.** That is the timeframe you have before something has time to blow up, it’s not. Other large forums have needed that amount of mods, and have managed mod crews of 150+ effectively. You redditors may be spending more time on the forum than them though, but we're still talking multiples of the current mods (except maybe in /r/askscience). 

**there are several ways of adding new mods.** You may consider adding batches of mods during set trial periods so you can train them together as a group

**differentiate mod roles:** Now, or someone finally pulling the trigger. Every community needs different levels of power suited to differentiated roles. This is something online communities are very aware of. Even 5man pro-gaming teams have a leader and 4 followers, online guilds, clans, and every other online forum have power structures and specialized roles/tasks.


**specific mod roles** Now, others who deal with CSS, bans, modmail, changes to rules etc. Specialization is the road to maximizing utility. 


**you need a power structure.** If there currently is no leader, someone to delegate specific tasks to specific people. Worst case scenario, have every current mod be a “leader mod” and every subsequent mod not be one. Bulky leadership leads to inefficiency and delays. 

**You can have a team based on respect with a hierarchy.** It is equally valuable to the betterment of the sub if you spend your time reading through comments and removing inappropriate ones as it is spending that same amount of time going through modmail, even if it's ""just"" someone who trawls /new and removes inappropriate comments. Being respected, heard and appreciated are different from being the final decision-maker. It’s all about good processes, just like in any offline organization. 


**The keys to successful moderation teams are communication and organization.** You need lead mods to organize other mods. If you have 30 mods who are tasked with reading comments and removing inappropriate ones


**recruiting more mods does not marginalize current mods.** Currently there are a host of incentives against recruiting more mods. The more mods, the less important you feel. With different types and levels of moderators, that is no longer true. Current mods don't lose anything by recruiting content-specific mods who trawl comments and /new. They have no other powers; their positions are never advertised as having other roles. Your position as a senior mod is not impacted by having a slew of mods with green names. Your distinct “senior mod color” could be a red username in Helvetica to distinguish you from the “content mod” green. Your impact as a mod isn't lessened because you now organize mods rather than doing all the hands-on stuff. You manage and delegate, direct, deal with policy and so on. It does not matter if you have 50-200 content mods under you who sign up knowing they’re there to do the dirty work.


I reiterate: no new policy


**The longer you put off adding mods, the worse it is to add more mods.

**Concerns and responses:** 

0. 10-15 minutes is unreasonable and unmangeable. **A:** The specific number can serve as a goal. 30 minutes is easily manageable. Subscribers who are capable of moderating this content already read it all within that time-frame

1. We may become unpopular if we remove more content. **A:** Users already agree to follow rediquette and the rules of your subreddit. You’re simply enforcing those rules. Individual people can become unpopular in cases where the messenger is shot. But at the end of the day, or they can leave. they really don't get a say. Results speak louder than words. People will appreciate spam-free communities. That’s the reason smaller subs exist that fill the same niches defaults do. 

2. We can’t organize this many mods **A:** Remember, mod issues and discussions. 

3. I’m against differentiated mod powers. **A:** Mods cannot nuke your sub if they have limited powers. You can track moderator actions and activity in the mod subreddit and remove mods that don't do anything. The whole culture of every mod being equal leads to a catch-22 situation where there's no way of moderating content and no way of adding enough mods to moderate content.

4. This seems like an awful lot of work. **A:** Some work is involved initially

5. Redditing is supposed to be a leisure activity! **A:** This is exactly why more moderation is needed. the concept of people creating reddit accounts to unsubscribe from defaults is evidence that too little moderation ruins the leisure and socially relaxed atmosphere. All the defaults are understaffed and it's lowering their quality of content significantly. 

6. I currently mod multiple large subs. **A:** To make an analogy



**Conclusion:** I urge you to reorganize the leadership of your large sub. Consider adding a slew of new mods so your sub actually becomes a moderated forum. askscience is good at removing off-topic content, and will reduce your current workloads significantly after an initial labor investment. 

Again, you’re our only hope!

Getting iffy: someone in another subreddit is discussing plans to troll your subreddit.

&gt;When a moderator approves a spam filtered link it will be put into the new listing with the current time (moving it to the front).

I'm going to omit the word ""probably"" in the charts to save space.

A second new thing I'm adding to look at is ""puppet/bot"" users. These are users that are moderators, funny_mod, etc. as well as the bots for various purposes (often flair-related) like BigFriendlyRobot.

This whole process of upvoting and downvoting.

The system is based on this. The dangerous combination of two elements: competition and conformity.

Not being able to even see subreddit rules defeats the purpose of having them.

Another aspect of this problem is that the main reddit submit page doesn't load the subreddit's sidebar either. Both issues are part of a general problem of people submitting to a sub without the sub's rules ever being on their screen.

Some questions:

1. How big a problem are app submissions for other mods? Is this even a knowable answer?
1. Which is a bigger problem: app submissions or submissions from the ~~main~~ frontpage submission screen?
1. Any ideas or proposed solutions?

If I could completely change the rules in any default subreddit, but every moderator does things a bit differently and I think if we had 100 different top moderators in a given subreddit we could have 100 different versions of that subreddit, it all comes down to personal preference and what rules a moderator chooses to implement and enforce.

Before I begin this thought experiment, a [quick search over at /r/SubredditDrama should fill you in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=atheism&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) I don't want this thread to be a discussion about drama, so please keep any such comments over there.

I know that /r/atheism has traditionally been moderated in a very hands-off style, so for the sake of this discussion, there would be no drama surrounding any rule changes that would be introduced.

The first thing I would do would be completely ban image submissions. In my experience, they have all either completely banned images, or images make up 90% or more of the submitted  content. I would use /u/AutoModerator to automatically remove all image submissions. If a subreddit like /r/AtheismRebooted already existed, I would heavily promote that subreddit and refer all removed submissions over there. **Disclaimer:** I do not feel that a blanket ban on images would be good for the *current* /r/atheism at all, because the community would not be happy about it. This is simply what I would have done from the beginning had I been the creator of /r/atheism all along.

There would be two exceptions to the image rule. First of all, obviously that would be allowed and would be an exception to the ban on images. Self posts that contain nothing but a link to an image would be removed. Submissions with an [IMG] or [Image] tag would be removed.

The second exception to the ban on images would be webcomics. Direct linking to webcomics would be allowed, as you can't submit the same link to the same subreddit twice, and it would ensure that any ad revenue generated from the exposure went directly to the artist.

I would conduct all policy discussion in full view of the public. Much like /r/PornOverlords, but there would be strict rules, and anyone who is trolling or harassing the moderators would be warned and repeat offenders would be banned.

I would let anyone who wanted to be a moderator become one. Absolutely anyone. There would be limits to how *quickly* the moderation team could grow, a list would be made, and we would be recruiting and training new moderators as fast as possible. We have the mod log, so any damage a rogue moderator could do would be quickly found and reversed by the other moderators. I would give only 1-3 moderators access to the sidebar &amp; css, because those shouldn't really be changed without discussion or by someone without experience.

Moderators have complete control over their subreddits, and have a solid system of policy discussion where every moderator has an equal vote, you can begin to approach something resembling an actual democracy on reddit.

---

Have you ever wondered how the Reddit community has changed since it started in 2005? I've only been active on Reddit since late 2011

**The current state of Reddit**

What does the Reddit community look like right now? Where do people submit their posts to? The graph below answers those questions at least in part by showing the number of posts that were submitted to each of the most active subreddits in the first week of November 2012.

[Graph: current subreddit distribution](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthCurrentDistribution.png)

If you're familiar with Reddit, /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/pics, and /r/aww. Four of them are focused on sharing pictures, and /r/AskReddit is used to ask questions of and share stories with other Redditors. Together, these five subreddits account for the majority of the content on the Reddit default front page nowadays.

The next 6 subreddits are a little more interesting. /r/trees (a subreddit dedicated to discussing marijuana), and /r/gaming capture the main interests of most Redditors, who are typically [20-something American male college students](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/07/who-in-world-is-reddit.html). Finally, /r/videos and /r/WTF are two more media-based subreddits.

From this brief survey, enjoy, and upvote. For better or for worse, Reddit's karma system favors pictures and short videos, and I expect there to be an ever-increasing trend of more pictures and fewer text-based posts.

I should note here that there are [thousands of active Reddit communities](http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_online_avg_1d/) nowadays

**How Reddit has changed over time**

Now that we know what the Reddit community looks like today

(I should note that I purposely excluded /r/reddit.com from this graph because it dominates the entire graph until about 2008

[Subreddit growth over time measured by fraction of posts submitted to each subreddit](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-all-time.png)

The biggest thing that you may notice is that there were very few subreddits from 2006-2008. In fact, politics,  entertainment, and gaming. Major subreddits dedicated to solely picture and video content started becoming popular in mid-2008, and even then their posts only comprised less than 1/4 of Reddit's content. It wasn't until 2011 did the picture-related subreddits really start taking over, and Reddit never looked back after that.

This graph covers so many changes in the Reddit community that it can't explain what happened by itself. In the following sections

**2005 - The Reddean Eon**

Reddit didn't show any signs of life until Thursday, when Reddit /u/ChickenLittle submitted the [first post on record to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/91/wired_news_beware_the_google_threat/) warning everyone about the threat that Google poses to our privacy in the future.

[2005 - The Reddean Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2005.png)

There wasn't really anything interesting happening during this time period, when they added core features like the ""hot"" page ranking (which is now default for the front page) and persistent upvotes.

**2006 - The Archreddean Eon**

2006 is finally when things get interesting! Presumably after one too many complaints about getting caught looking at pictures of breasts ""on accident"" on Reddit, showing how eager Redditors are to share NSFW content. It's amusing to read [their curt blog post about making the new subreddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/01/for-those-of-you-with-private-office.html), where they state:

| We'll be playing around with more of these sub-sections to reddit in the future. Should be fun.

I guess they didn't know that they had stumbled into an idea that would later make Reddit what it is today.

[2006 - The Archeddean Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2006.png)

You'll notice in February, they started adding all kinds of subreddits during February: [Olympics, feature request, and subreddit request subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/its-about-time-we-added-something-new.html); [language-specific subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/reddit-becomes-multilingual.html); and [yet more language-specific subreddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/more-languages-and-shoutout-in-english.html). A few more topical subreddits showed up later as well, which are vaguely mentioned in the blogs. For the most part, though, Reddit's content came from /r/reddit.com

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/programming

*Notable subreddits died this year*

Most of the language subreddits died before they even had a chance. Survival of the fittest!

**2007 - The Protereddoic Eon**

2007 marks the extinction of all but two of the remaining language-specific subreddits that hadn't already died. The main techie-friendly subreddits (/r/programming and /r/science) thrived

[2007 - The Protereddoic Eon](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2007.png)

The biggest change in subreddits that we can see here is the explosive emergence of /r/politics. It seems like Redditors in 2007 were dying to have a politically oriented subreddit, we can confirm just that: [/r/politics was an addition by popular demand](http://blog.reddit.com/2007/08/politics-reddit.html). Redditors of 2007 were so politically-oriented that they had /r/obama created over a year before the election!

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/politics, /r/gaming, /r/gadgets, /r/sports

*Notable subreddits died this year*

The rest of the language subreddits except for the Japanese and Italian subreddits. They really liked Reddit!

The rest of the subreddits dedicated to outside blogs: /r/lipstick.com

**2008 - Reddit's Cambrian Explosion**

If you've been following the graphs

[2008 - Reddit's Cambrian Explosion](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2008.png)

This year, people created /r/pics, /r/funny, /r/WTF, and many other subreddits dedicated to pictures. In just the matter of a few months, 1/3 of Reddit's content was sorted from /r/reddit.com into subreddits dedicated to specific topics. Thanks to the new ""create your own subreddit"" feature, Redditors were able to sort the majority of their own content out into the proper forums. The Reddit system works! Cool!

It's also pretty cool to see the spike in posts to /r/politics and /r/obama near election time in November

I was interested in just how many subreddits were created in this time period

[Subreddit diversity over time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/UniqueSubredditsSubmittedToOverTime.png)

Panel A shows the very gradual increase in subreddits from 2006-2008 as Reddit's managers slowly added subreddits by request. Panel B shows the huge blip in the number of subreddits during the ""create your own subreddit"" beta period, there were as many as 14,000 different subreddits active at once, and I'm sure it's kept growing since then!

**2009 - The Great /r/reddit.com Spike**

By the end of 2008, with yet more content filtering into subject-specific subreddits and /r/reddit.com becoming increasingly obsolete.

**2010 - The Year Gamers and Porn Invaded**

If it wasn't obvious in 2009, guys.""](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/trees.png) Interestingly, there appears to be a decline in all of the techie-friendly subreddits at the end of 2010, when the Digg exodus was in full force. /r/gonewild also seems to have started growing in popularity during the Digg exodus (not shown here -- it was still very small), so maybe Redditors have something to thank Digg for!

Apparently spammers became a huge problem on Reddit in 2010

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/ColbertRally had a short-lived spike in the months immediately before and after the rally happened. It's really neat how you can detect the big political events that Reddit participates in by looking at these spikes!

/r/leagueoflegends, and many more gaming-related subreddits.

*Notable subreddits died this year*

/r/RapidshareList died as quickly as it came to life

/r/Marijuana went down in flames as /r/trees took over.

**2011 - The Year /r/reddit.com Died**

Ah, after all -- we have been afforded a rare opportunity to see how removing a massive subreddit can affect an online community. Now, let's take a look...

(I should note that I moved /r/reddit.com to the top of the graph here so its removal at the end doesn't cause a wave in all the other subreddit's areas.)

[2011 - The Year the /r/reddit.com Died](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2011.png)

For the most part, Advice Animals... many of our favorite memes first appeared on Reddit in 2011. Fewer people talked about politics, world news, etc. and instead preferred the easy laughs and upvotes that memes offered. Using [stattit.com's subreddit time machine](http://stattit.com/time_machine/), we can see how dramatically the front page shifted during this time period:

[front page from January 1st,t3_aklvl,t3_aklqe,t3_akk8w,t3_aki14,t3_akl6u,t3_akf7b,t3_akkjf,t3_akgzm,t3_akjks

In late October, the images from /r/pics moved to the other image subreddits (/r/funny, /r/f7u12, /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/WTf, and /r/aww) for some reason. Apparently, the /r/pics mods decided they didn't like the sudden influx of meme pictures to their subreddit, and quickly became the most active subreddits.

By the way, and /r/skyrim for its November release. I should also note here that Minecraft, Starcraft, and TF2 have done a great job of maintaining active communities around their respective video games!

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/occupywallstreet sprang to life in late 2011

Bronies everywhere came together at /r/mylittlepony to rejoice in all that is wonderful about My Little Pony. I've never understood the appeal myself

*Notable subreddits died this year*

/r/reddit.com went down in a Rasputin-like fashion

**2012 - The Year Picture Subreddits Took Over**

Finally

Removing /r/reddit.com seemed to make pictures even more popular on Reddit. Just check the [front page on January 1,t3_nye1e,t3_nylqv,t3_nz0ed,t3_nyrq5,t3_nylx0,t3_nz26m,t3_nybxx,t3_nyl59,t3_nyikq

[2012 - The Year Picture Subreddits Took Over](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/SubredditGrowthOverTime-2012.png)

Apparently Redditors got tired of the rage comics in 2012, though, is how /r/trees remained remarkably active despite the fact that it's not a default subreddit. Reddit has some seriously dedicated tokers!

/r/politics experienced a small resurgence of activity near November for the 2012 Presidential elections, stoners, and picture/meme lovers.

Finally

*Notable subreddits born this year*

/r/ModerationLog was created to log all of the submissions that were removed by moderators of Reddit's various subreddits. There seems to be quite a lot of moderation going on nowadays!

/r/POLITIC's post bot has excelled at bringing content into this subreddit

*Notable subreddits died this year*

**One last word on the future of Reddit**

I have one last comment on the future of Reddit. I've seen a lot of people getting disparaged by how Reddit is slowly becoming a sophisticated image board

[Subreddit diversity over time](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/UniqueSubredditsSubmittedToOverTime.png)

What's readily apparent from this graph is that even though the picture subreddits are dominating Reddit in terms of pure number of submissions, I think Reddit needs a new tool -- or set of tools -- to help new Redditors find smaller subreddits that interest them.

The part people *really* didn't like was the bit excluding suggestions of how the admins could change the site. People like talking about that stuff. I wanted it out of ToR for two reasons. One is that there's already a place for talking about admin-level chances: /r\/IdeasForTheAdmins. The other is that idle speculation about how things *could* be different (if only people would change the very nature of the site on our behalf) was starting to drown out discussion about how we could empower ourselves and make changes as users and moderators.

Since I stopped modding ToR, but I think they'd like your input before they settle one way or the other. What I've suggested is replacing the current rule about admin-level suggestions with this one:

I was just browsing the frontpage and stumbled upon [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u4hhh/reddit_what_is_the_most_powerful_image_you_have/) question in /r/Askreddit. Needless to say

The first few top posts were pretty typical, however, get a little weird. I have screenshotted them along with some of the comments for context as well as provided the actual imgur links to the images. It seems that the links to certain photos in the thread are not what the posters are claiming them to be. So either this is some huge raid (given how many upvotes they have) or someone is getting hacked. Either way, here are my examples: 

[Here's the first one.](http://i.imgur.com/9BjZH.jpg) From what I can determine

[Here's the third one.](http://i.imgur.com/eZPxi.jpg) The poster calls it ""tank man"" which is probably a reference to [this photo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Tianasquare.jpg/300px-Tianasquare.jpg). But

I've recently come across an interesting [article](http://allthingsd.com/20120412/meet-9gag-the-community-comedy-site-thats-growing-like-crazy/) regarding the growth of 9gag. The co-founder of 9gag has reported that their site gets 67 million unique visitors and 2 billion page views. Assuming that's the April report

With the fall of digg during their v4 debut, but at a faster rate, and adding their watermark. The 9gag watermark may have contributed to 9gag's growth when content gets reshared to other sites (i.e Facebook). There isn't anything we can do since watermarks, or uploading original content to imgur (like [/r/comics](/r/comics)) is frowned upon here at reddit.

Another argument some of you may point out is that reddit and 9gag clearly focus on two different niches. 9gag focuses on sharing of images (memes or not), so I don't receive this type of junk content. 

In addition

Are the reddit staff considering these issues? I hope they have a roadmap for reddit in the longrun. What do you guys think about this?

**Some Analysis**

My original question was whether or not the users of r/starcraft participate in fewer subreddits than 'normal' users.  The short answer is yes.  Users of r/starcraft participate in other subreddits less than other users.  This is true for posters and commenters.

Interestingly, likely due to the high number of throwaways used there for posting.  The commenters' numbers for IAmA aren't abnormal.

Whether you are talking about /r/bestof, /r/Circlebroke, they do have a noticeable effect on whatever thread they feature. Often this can cause users reading the thread to get a false impression of how the community usually behaves. For example

As a moderator of /r/bestof, I feel that /r/bestof benefits reddit as a whole in the long run, bringing more exposure to smaller subreddits, spreading out the userbase &amp; educating them in the process. While it may have a positive effect overall in the long run, I certainly agree that it can cause an acute negative effect in the short term, and moderators need to stay diligent when their subreddit is linked to by a meta subreddit.

I have an idea for a bot that would help with this, and message the moderators of any subreddit that gets linked. That way mods would know right away when their subreddit might be experiencing some increased exposure and traffic, and be prepared.

It's a term casually thrown around on reddit these days. We have large communities devoted exclusively to circlejerking. It has even, circlejerking is not so easy to pin down. Like obscenity or pornography

Regardless, the participants express their views not so much because they believe in them (although they very well may), but because they like having their egos stroked. The danger of a circlejerk is the same as the danger of groupthink: that minority viewpoints will be shut out and erroneous views and courses of action will be adopted without a critical eye.

When I see a reddit post titled, I can even predict that one of the top comments will be a complaint that the whole thread should be moved to /r/circlejerk or something along those lines.

The reason I am able to predict what the top comments will be like is that the reddit community has coalesced around a viewpoint on those topics. But what is the difference between community consensus and circlejerking? As far as I can tell

It's as if the people who use the term circlejerk are unable to believe that a group of people would legitimately disagree with them,"" rather than a legitimate and inevitable result of having a community. 

I'm not saying that groupthink is not something to be scrutinized. I am saying that charges of circlejerking and groupthink have really gotten out of hand on reddit lately. And the adoption of the wildly subjective term ""circlejerking"" as a reason to delete threads and content is a smokescreen for moderators to get rid of content they don't like. A really good example is andrewsmith1986 allowing the fake suicide thread in AskReddit to stay up

TL;DR: Reddit, and consensus viewpoints certainly have inherent dangers. But the other side of the coin is that not all community consensus is groupthink. To call a community of belief a ""circlejerk"" merely because it does not match your own viewpoint is kind of idiotic. To delete content on a default subreddit based on your own idea of what a circlejerk is or is not is downright arbitrary censorship.

A key aspect of this is that predictions are built on reason

So, and perhaps with enough information one could make an appropriate educated guess. And similarly with Reddit, we can achieve a nontrivial prediction with relevant information.

This concept has been touched on before by Isaac Asimov in his *Foundation* series, and that in order for the predictions to be successful, the population cannot know about them (as that would of course change their actions).

In ToR, and so our predictions will be less amazing. But it should still be possible to make predictions that are one step beyond obvious, and that would be really cool. It may be possible to take the leap from observing Reddit to beginning to look into its future.

&gt; **N8theGr8**: They used to generate karma, karma whoring self-posts, so the admins removed the ability for them to generate karma.

&gt; **ymersvennson**: What would that be

For examples, bear in mind that this was in 2008, when Reddit's user population was a fraction of what it is now.

Of course, at least theoretically, obviate the need for a change in how submissions are scored. And two: people still post that sort of thing, even though self.posts no longer award karma.

Both of which are true, people continued to do it -- so much so that the front page was quickly infested with ""Vote up if"" posts.

As far as I can tell from looking back at the Internet Wayback Machine, karmawhoring went rampant, and the admins [jumped in](http://www.reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) to stem the tide. (It would help flesh out that time line if someone could tell me exactly when self.posts were first implemented on Reddit.)

As for the second point (that people still post the equivalent of ""vote up if"" self.posts), it pushed those submissions into their own reddits.

Consider, there was very little incentive for posting to a reddit like /r/DAE. If your goal was to get as much karma as possible, why would you post to a reddit with 90,000 viewers, rather than, say, /r/politics, how would a fledgling reddit like /r/DAE even get off the ground in the first place? The answers are

Take away the karma incentive, that's because, with the karma incentive gone, the karmawhores quickly abandon that format. Other motives take over. One such motive is that of appealing to the *best* (as in, most specialized) audience for a particular submissions, not just the biggest possible. People with legitimate questions will tend to take them to the reddit they think is most likely to give them a good answer. That makes it possible for reddits like /r/AskScience to build the momentum necessary to become really good at what they do.

Which does not mean, making our posts more difficult to pin to reddiquette, even as the reddiquette grows more extensive and more difficult to bear in mind. These days, you're more likely to see ""vote up if""-style submissions take the form of a link to an image of a favorite childhood television show or book, with a title like ""No, this is the best *x* of all time.""

The form has changed

The applicable reddiquette is easy enough to update, but it seems to me that there's a fair amount of what you might call ""in principle"" redundancy in the reddiquette, with the potential for much, much more. To the policy against ""pleading for votes,"" we could add something that also covers ""No, this""-style submissions, but doing so only adds to the burden imposed by reddiquette, I think, means communicating a better sense of what it is Reddit's supposed to do in the first place.

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit change the way moderation teams are structured

**Discussion**

Mod hierarchy and unilateral subreddit control comes up most frequently when discussing the defaults.  However

Without hierarchy, if not years of work with a few clicks to demod those who have been taking care of the subreddit on a day to day basis. 

* When would it acceptable to rearrange the structure of a mod team?

* What metrics could be used to support the removal of a top moderator?

* Is there any way to employ this without completely stripping 'creator's rights' that the reddit community typically celebrates?

* Could the role of moderator function entirely without hierarchy?

* Could these rules be applied to all reddit communities

* Is there any way to formalize these decisions in such a way that it could be applied fairly to any subreddit

**Assumptions:**

- Reddit sees itself as an (mostly) intellectual meeting ground filled with (mostly) progressive people.

- Individual user's interactions often quickly shift from positive discussion to dead end argument

- Most redditors (people) would (like to) consider themselves rational.


**Observed Behaviors:**
*Note: Originally this section contained examples, or the encouragement of drama I will leave finding direct examples of these observations as an exercise to the reader. Most of these examples can be found on the front page on a daily basis, and some even can be found in otherwise well moderated threads.*

***Allowing lack of clarification to spiral immediately into argument rather than seeking an understanding of idea presented. Example:***

&gt; **ActuallyBelievesinSouthernHeritage (ABSH)**: ""Well i believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of heritage not racism""

&gt; **SouthernMinorityWithNegativeExperiences:** ""You're racist""

* In this example we see two people who have an opportunity at a real discussion on race miss a golden opportunity to immediate assumption of hostility. While someone with the goal of learning or conversation would seemingly rationally wish to pursue the ""Why would you think that symbol was anything other than of hate?"" a personal investment in the matter leads to an understandable emotional response. 

* Despite the fact that ABSH *actually believes in southern heritage* and might change his opinion on the perception of the confederate flag given an understanding of a different viewpoint

***Assumption of mental superiority in a way that is not logically consistent.***

&gt; **DoesnotUnderstandConcept:** I don't understand this concept

&gt; **ThinksConceptIsBasic:** If you can't handle this task then maybe this isn't the field for you

&gt; **ThinksOPIsUninitiated:** You know, this is to note that many of these responses make no effort to point the user to more amateur friendly communities, beginner materials, or a tip on a starting point).

&gt; **ThinksConceptIsAdvanced:** This concept is really too advanced for you if you, not a dead end.)

&gt; **ThinksPosterIsGenerallyPoor:** Why would a guy like *you* want to know concept

* There are many examples, is twofold:

1. Empathetic Appeal: If a user is so advanced
2. Narcissicstic Appeal: If the user is so intelligent why can he not figure out a method to explain the information so as to inform those he feels is ""lesser""? While not everyone wishes to learn

***Assumptions based on affiliation***

* This section essentially writes itself. Examples abound in the wild and can be seen unfortunately often when two groups on opposite sides of an issue meet in either space

*The problem with assumption by affiliation is it is a simple way to free users the effort of classification by presentation of ideas. While not all users of opposing groups assume by affiliation the trend is common enough to see the following exchange on a regular basis:

&gt; **ControversialGroupMemberHasInformation:** I have [information] with [source]

&gt; **OpposingGroupMember:** I have information that you are a member of our enemy

**Wrap-up/Conclusions**

These are only a few of the observations i've noted compiled in the interest of time and readability. This is a hypothesis

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Do you feel Reddit is/displays/proclaims intelligence/progressivness. For either response

2. Do you feel you have experienced an instance where an argument was had where an exchange of information could have occurred with patience and mutual understanding?

3. Do you consider yourself intellectual/nerdy/academic/smart/clever/quickwitted.

3b. Do you feel you've had an instance where you were condescending where you could have been educational?

3c. Do you sometimes/often/rarely feel that you *do* present information

*Set 2 until i figure out how to format lists properly*

4. If you have posted a question

5. Do you feel that there is anything you can do to increase the level of discourse as relates to this topic/idea/hypothesis. Do you feel this is a valid hypothesis

6. Are there any observations on some of the negative interactions between question seekers and possible experts you would like to add? The positive?

My data shows the average net votes per year is decreasing well below the bar score Gravity13 set in his previous [analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/h0ymi/how_karma_actually_works/). He claimed scores were hovering around 2000

Okay

* The rate at which the front page is refreshed has increased due to an increased number of posts in general and in submissions that require little time to consume

* Popular submissions that take little time to consume might be seen as more disposable; that is

* If submissions in general are spending less time on the front page chances are they are receiving less votes overall. This adds to the reasons why the density of popular posts increases at lower scores.

* After a post reaches a certain level of visibility people are less incentivized to vote it up

What is your take on this data?

From the data that I gathered you can tell a few things. Firstly I need more of it

Secondly the size of the subreddit only has a limited effect on how many comments got gilded. /r/music and /r/AdviceAnimals both got only one gold comments where as /r/picrequests

It's quite obvious that /r/AskReddit is where most of the gilded comments are with 82/200 (or just over 40%). I think part of the reason is because most people browsing the defaults don't read the comments

I also think it's worth stating that certain people will be better able to give Reddit gold more easily than others. For example

For example

Moreover, first of all, who's obstructing what, and if ""who"" ends up being someone they like, or ""what"" ends up being something they oppose, they might actually find themselves in favor of obstructing it.

And that may be the single most appealing aspect of this experiment: that it actually forces readers to click through to the articles if they want to know what the link is about beyond the barest generalities. Which puts them that much closer to actually reading the articles.

I think that one of the reasons for Reddit's success is the free-wheeling discussion which is relatively uncensored.

Here are some relevant ideas:

* Having one's post removed *hurts*

* Should moderators choose the feel of a subreddit

* How do we ensure that Reddit is not censored for political purposes if moderators make a habit of removing anything they don't like?

* How can anyone make a case against a poor moderator if censorship becomes the norm?

* Do we want people self-censoring material before they post?

As you may have guessed

Do we really want strong censorship for Reddit?

Part of the problem is that ""low-effort"" sounds like an accusation. I have no doubt that some people even mean it that way. There's an ambiguity to the phrase—it could be taken to mean effort on the part of the voter (which is how I initially meant it) or effort on the part of the submitter. The latter interpretation evokes an us-versus-them mentality that tends to bring the entire discussion to an impasse. All too often, some people using the phrase probably even mean it that way.

Besides, and how some types of content that can be adequately assessed and voted upon in less time have a natural advantage over types that take longer to consider.

Over the last few months, one of the most interesting to watch evolve has been /r/funny. With close to three million members, and tons of posts with over 2000 net upvotes per day, this subreddit could, in some ways, foreshadow the near future for subs like /r/wtf, /r/pics

The most notable change that has occurred over the last year and a half (and more intensely over the last couple months) has been the shift in upvoting versus commenting. In my initial time on this site, which made the feel a lot different. Although the images and submissions were a tad more original, the comment threads were what kept me coming back for more. 

Recently, as they'll say banal things about the image or about the situation represented. Obviously /r/funny has not been funny in a long time, but the turnout of upvotes to comments is remarkably different than any other community I've seen on reddit.

Personally, as internet sharing capabilities increase and reddit users are more compelled to advertise the community on meme pages and as high-profile accounts share obviously reddit-related material.

&gt;Reddit’s voting system makes it the ultimate experiment in the democratization of news and content. With a population of millions

&gt;Reddit has a handy point system for quantifying contributions to the community. Called karma

&gt;But karma doesn't represent everything on Reddit. Volunteer moderators often work in the background, run smoothly. Moderators, or mods, also make decisions about subreddit rules that can affect hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

&gt;Karma points also don’t always reflect the weight of ideas as they spread across the community—or the growing scrutiny from outsiders brought on by controversial user activity.

This would, it would serve to remind users of how bad things can get without that moderation. In subs where the value of moderation is more questionable, it would allow everyone to see how little their current moderation changes about the community. And for everyone it would serve as a limited test of the current state of moderation in their sub.

To mark the occasion

Once the holiday starts, keep an eye on the sub, and contribute as regular users. But in principle, at least, they should not do any moderating. That means no removing off-topic posts, no releasing anything from the spam filter, no updating the CSS or marking posts NSFW or toying with flair. Of course, but the ideal would be zero moderation for the duration of the holiday.

My response:

&gt; I think the problem is that the majority of Reddit users don't know (and don't care to know) how a properly run subreddit works.

So what is the back page? Simply put, month, week, 24 hours, or hour). You can access the ""last 24 hours"" page through the following link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=all&amp;before=t3_14ymyf&amp;t=day

If you get ""there doesn't seem to be anything here""

* Look in your preferences for the option to ""hide links with a score lower than..."". If it's set to something (probably -4) disable it by leaving the field empty. 

* Also make sure you don't have ""hide links I've downvoted"" enabled.

* If you're using RES

____
Notice how the URL has the *&amp;t=day tag*. This is important because attempting to change the time period from the ""back page"" will redirect you to /r/all/top. There are two ways to change the time period:

* Go to /r/all/top

* Replace the *&amp;t=day* with another time tag. Here are the others: &amp;t=hour ; &amp;t=week ; &amp;t=month ; &amp;t=year ; &amp;t=all


Now

Whenever you visit page 2 of the front page

     
     http://www.reddit.com/?count=25&amp;after=t3_1kern4

?count=25 tells reddit that the first post on the page will be labeled as ""25"". You can alter the count on the url and change the numbers displayed

 http://www.reddit.com/?count=8008134&amp;after=t3_1kern4

will tell you that the 1st post on this page is post number 8008135 ^^^huehuehue ^^^BOOBIES

Long story short

reddit.com/?count=25&amp;after=t3_**1kern4**

Post ID's can be found on the post comment page's URL

For example

So how do you determine a post's ID? Just check the URL:

reddit.com/r\/Kawaii_Eyes/comments/**1kern4**/ssensei_i_llike_you/

Fun fact: you can make ""short links"" to posts by simply adding the post ID to the end of reddit's URL

www.reddit.com/1kern4/ will link to said post!

The last important part of the url is the fact that it says ""after""

reddit.com/?count=25&amp;**after**=t3_1kern4

This tells the page to load posts that are *less popular* than the post ID'd in the url. 

Simply put

_________

The back page's url has been modified. ""after"" has been replaced with ""before"" (reversing the order) and the post ID included is the ID of [the lowest rated reddit post of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14ymyf/we_are_members_of_the_westboro_baptist_church_we/) (WBC's AMA). This tells reddit to display posts in ascending order starting with the lowest rated post of all time (which is omitted from the page). Simply put

0.) Worst post of all time (not included)

1.) Worst post of time period (or 2nd worst post of all time)

2.) 2nd worst post of time period (or 3rd worst post of all time)

ect. 

The only limitation is the fact that it can only show 25 posts; the next button will not work. You can however modify the URL yourself with the 25th post's ID to generate a second page and so on.

One of the appealing features of reddit is that usernames are not emphasized by design as posts are supposed to be judged by their content. The voting system would then be used to sort these posts and hopefully the best content will rise to the top.

Some of the rules proposed below are more clear-cut than others; some may need extra care to avoid leading to censorship. This is an initial suggestion to give some examples

First

* Too short.

* Contains a link to a .gif animation.

* Contains a link to a blacklisted domain (e.g.

* All caps.

* Low score on a [readability test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test).

* Contains a word from a blacklist (e.g.

* Newly registered accounts.

Some positive rules:

* Long comments.

* Contains link(s). Images may be given a lower positive score than generic links. Educational and .org domains can be given a higher score.

* High score on a readability test.

* Comment is part of a conversation. That is

* Comments from the OP.

We can also look at spam-filtering rules for more ideas.

Some initial questions to get the discussion started. Does this whole idea have merit? What (types of) subreddits would be appropriate for it? Would moderators of these subreddits be willing to try it out? Good/bad/dangerous rules? How about distinguishing particularly high-ranking comments in a popular thread?",,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/rlz5b/improving_the_quality_of_comments_with_a_bot/

Additionally, with everything else that deviated too far from it downvoted into hiding. Without the constant reinforcement of what it *should* be, the new voters have little idea what the standard is for an excellent comment is (fuck, I miss RobotRollCall).

That's a structural problem with the way that the AS mods are dealing with it. Sure, which the mods really have no way of emphasizing or highlighting.

I won't go so far as to say it's hopeless, the problem people are those who aren't going to put in the time to familiarize themselves with the rules. It takes repeated interactions with standard bearers, mod or not, for a subreddit to defend its culture.

This problem reflects on the larger issue of elitism, accusation that we receive in ToR. With something like science, it's much easier to talk shit about Eternal September, because science is not a popularity contest. I'd extrapolate this to other topics as well, because the most interesting thoughts come the most consistently from the elite folks at the frontier. I don't believe in the democratic ideal, at least in matters of taste. I'd rather place myself in an avant-garde bubble, because I *want* to be superior to the ""commoners"" goddamnit.

1321799218.0,mj0ln,"Active moderation vs. the laissez-faire approach; or, Which users should the mods cater to? The ones who vote blindly from the front page, or the ones who comment, contribute to and care about the community?",,20, [/r/pics](/r/pics) has recently overgone a major overhaul in terms of the official subreddit rules and the degree to which moderators keep a close eye on the front page. [Five simple rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/lb24q/rpics_ruleset/) have given way to sweeping changes in the overall image of the subreddit; no pictures of text (including image macros), and no non-author urls in images.

Many users speculated that these changes would create an outcry from the subscribers, *they wouldn't keep getting voted to the front page! If the moderators enforced these new rules, there will be backlash, cries of oppression, witch hunts!* Indeed, the [recent controversy](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/mhant/legitimate_rpolitics_censorship_drama_involving/) in [/r/politics](/r/politics) and [/r/wtf](/r/wtf) have seemingly proven this point.

However, a network home to most likely the strictest subreddits around in terms of rules and the enforcement of those rules by the mod team, there have been no witch hunts, no cries of censorship and oppression. There is a sense of trust between the mods and the userbase. The rules are plainly spelled out, enforced universally, and the distrust of moderators that exists in the default reddits is virtually non-existent.

I believe this is due to the fact that everyone 'knows the deal, rage comics are frequent, if not commonplace. When one is removed from the front page due to some obscure (or worse, unwritten) rule, the users have every right to cry ""foul!"" Why shouldn't they? Moderators should be accountable for their actions. If a submission is removed, it should be plainly justified by citing a rule that is plainly visible either on the sidebar of the subreddit, or in a document that is linked to in the sidebar. 'Shadowbanning' submissions without clear justification other than the mod ""didn't feel it belonged"" is a good way to start a witch hunt. Try starting a witch hunt when the user is clearly in violation of the rules and the mod was justified (as well as courteous and polite). It won't happen, and [the OP will be relentlessly flamed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lozqp/where_can_i_make_a_formal_complaint_about_a/).

Let's get back to [/r/pics](/r/pics), it was initially met with lackluster reception. As documented in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/lb24q/rpics_ruleset/c2rf91x), **after the first 17 hours, the announcement had only 35 upvotes and 18 downvotes.** In a subreddit of over a million users, those numbers are simply pathetic. Any other thread would have died in the new queue. However, most threads haven't been sitting in a permanent sticky on the front page of [/r/pics](/r/pics) for over a month.

**As of this writing, the announcement is sitting at over 900 karma, with 1,263 upvotes and 357 downvotes.** A quick scan of the comments shows an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the userbase. This is the top comment:

&gt;kwangqengelele 337 points 1 month ago (398|60)   
&gt;I fully support this. No more text screenshots.

Which leads us to the question

There are two types of users on reddit, she would be one of these users. These users are why a submission will reach the front page even when the comments section is tearing the OP to threads. Collectively these users are known as the 'hivemind,' and many moderators make the mistake of catering to these users. *Someone upvoted all of these posts, so they must be appropriate for the subreddit, right?* I'll tell you why that line of reasoning is wrong.

These users contribute absolutely nothing to the community. Reddit is a source of entertainment to them. They have no idea how it works, these users are the ones the moderators should cater to above all others. Commonly referred to as ""the vocal minority,"" these users are often brushed aside.

**Not in [my subreddits](http://redditdirectory.com/6301/syncretic)

As moderators, not from the front page. The ones who have a *customized* front page. The ones who comment on a regular basis. The ones who have a working knowledge of how reddit works. We can't allow the hivemind to dictate the future of reddit. If we do, we are nothing more than a glorified image board. We are 4chan with upvotes.

Do you know why that musn't be allowed?

Because the lurkers will eventually do one of two things; many of them will abandon reddit and move onto the next flavor of the week. In that case, however, those users will stop lurking some day. One day they will leave an insightful comment, and it will be upvoted. As everyone reading this knows, that first upvote is beautiful... and addicting. Some users are content to stay as commenters, and that's fine. Comments bring value to a community; after all, who wants to stay in a subreddit where no one leaves comments? But some users won't be content with just commenting.

After a while, and what is it for. A polite, courteous and helpful mod will be there to either approve their submission, or tell them why exactly it was removed. After a few submissions are rescued, the spam filter is trained to like submissions from that user. They start submitting more, gaining karma and hopefully some new friends along the way. Guess what? They aren't lurkers anymore. Now is when their opinion should matter... when they are an active member of the community.

**TL;DR:** Get the fuck out of here. I didn't spend almost two hours composing this thread so you could TL;DR this shit.

dissemination. Several sites such as Youtube
Twitter, comment on and rate the content
posted by other users. This user generated content
has given rise to a whole bunch of interesting problems such as prediction of content popularity

problems involves understanding the underlying sociological processes and coming up with appropriate
algorithmic solutions. The goal of this report is two
fold. Firstly
user attributes

For a long time

But recently I have made an actual ban on the practice (offending posts will be removed)

----

**[XPOST] tags serve two main

* **They help promote small

It helps the subreddit find an audience

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/13go00/actual_photo_of_extreme_deep_field_from_hubble/): 

    Actual photo of Extreme Deep Field from Hubble [pic] [xpost from exposureporn]    
    ((subreddit has fewer than 20k subscribers))

* **They help source original content that was posted elsewhere on Reddit.** Sometimes a redditor will post their own original content to Reddit

At least for my subreddit

The **optional** part of the sourcing process is putting an [xpost] tag in the title, she has done nothing wrong.

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/xufq5/fireworks_when_the_camera_refocuses_during_the/):

    Fireworks
    ((post was original content first posted by another redditor))

----

**But

* Many redditors assume that a crosspost that is not labelled as a crosspost

[Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14jouc/pool_gif/c7dqetw?context=1):

    Complainer A - ""Nowadays it feels like everything gets reposted from /r/gifs to here.""
    User B - ""The word you are looking for is ""crossposted""
    Complainer A - ""over half of them aren't labeled as crossposts""

 [Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14lz0l/cleaning_my_ferrari_gif/c7edfpo?context=3):

    Submission: Cleaning my Ferrari [GIF]
    ((unlabelled crosspost from the hugely popular /r/gifs))
    Comment: ever heard of NO REPOSTS

This is despite the fact that /r/gifs is one of the most popular subreddits on the website, so there is no reason to source.

For every idiot that actually takes the time to harrass and verbally assault people about this

* Many redditors are of the mindset that if you don't add an [XPOST] tag

[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/14opng/sun_sequence_picxpost_from_rpics/c7fht6t):
    
    ""Got it. So when I cross post from another subreddit
    don't give any indication that it was from another subreddit. 
    Just act like it was something I found or made all on mine own.""

This is despite the fact that Reddit automatically provides a DISCUSSIONS tab at the top of every crosspost

Furthermore

A random redditor shouldn't deserve credit for telling you about something any more than anyone else in real life deserves credit. Let credit be reserved for people who create original content

**TL;DR -** 

Many posters now downvote and leave negative comments below submissions that don't use [xpost] tags

It's also amusing to observe how people who are operating at the same levels giggle about things like they're sharing an inside joke, but *fully understand* the other side's argument.

Last night I took the liberty of modifying some of that code to include a warning on several unoriginal, as well as implicitly encouraging our users to downvote such submissions. However, if the submissions are upvoted anyway, they will not be removed, because they technically violate no rule.

When reddit goes down, or informative. Simply because it's something that all redditors can relate to, especially those redditors who tried to log on during the downtime. Posts about the downtime net more up votes, and consequently rise to the top of the ""What's hot"" queue, elbowing out content with a narrower but more critical appeal.

Then comes the backlash. Because most redditors will see multiple submissions about the downtime on their front page, or, more to the point, [that one](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/glhqz/dear_reddit_users/)\) about the posts about the downtime. Less traction, of course, since not as many people will see the first round of downtime posts as were affected by the downtime, but traction all the same.

*So what?* someone will say. *People up vote what they like. If you don't like it

Take a spin through the smaller communities, 25,000 subscribers. How many of them have front paged submissions about the downtime? Apart from /r/ToR (now), I'd wager very few.

There are, the new queue is harder to keep up with when there are 500,000 people involved, as there are in /r/worldnews, where there have been 140 submissions in the last 24 hours (and that's with 6 hours of downtime). That means, first of all, that contributors are less likely to sort through all of the recent submissions to make sure their content hasn't already been submitted under a different URL.

Maybe more to the point, voters are more likely to distribute their votes among different sets of content, without looking for redundancy. In a community like /r/worldevents, which has under 4,000 subscribers and had only 4 new submissions in the last 24 hours, it's easy to keep up with the new queue, even if you only log in once every day or two. Subscribers aren't likely to up vote the same content twice

To be fair, since smaller reddits get submissions gradually enough that a submission might stay on the front page for weeks, while a submission in a large subreddit has to continue getting up votes to stay on the front page for even a single day, but that's part of my point. The increase in active redditors is a quantitative change that results in qualitative differences.

So,000+ subscribers, which means it got there on the strength of something like 0.0001% of the current subscribers bothering to vote on it at all, and which got 1,000+ submissions in the last 24 hours, which puts that submission in something like the top 2%. Most reddits would need an additional 100,000 subscribers or more to even aspire to that level of indifference, getting 0.0001% to vote at all (not even necessarily up) is an achievement that elevates your post above 98% of what's posted there.

In other words, the bar for entry relative to the number of available votes will tend to be much higher than in the super-reddits.

Since the new queue there moves so quickly

As a consequence, they only need a relatively insignificant proportion of the total available votes. What likely happens is this. Some of us are on from 12 to 1, looking through the new queue. There aren't many of us, but there are enough to promote something to front page status. And the submission we're most likely to agree on is the one with the broadest appeal. In this case, it's a post about reddit downtime. From 1 to 2, a different small group is cruising the new queue, and they promote another submission. They have a different pool of submissions to choose from, they end up promoting

That effect gets further amplified by the sheer number of submissions larger reddits get. Since it's harder to keep up with the new queue, making it eligible for votes that most submissions to /r/pics never had a chance of getting.

Earlier

The qualitative difference, submissions that rise to the top of the hot queue in very large reddit will be those approved by a very small minority of subscribers who happened to be viewing the new queue when it appeared. Once on the hot queue, they will tend to maintain a more or less predictable life span there, benefiting from the momentum they gain from the sheer fact of being exposed to more potential votes than most submissions to the same reddit.

That's a pretty significant transformation of the way that reddit's voting mechanism works from one reddit to another.",,t5_2rtff,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/glm65/100000_people_walk_into_a_bar/

## Background

Ever since [No Pics Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iem31/ever_wonder_what_reddit_would_look_like_without/), images will tend to outcompete other forms of content, regardless of what the users would prefer.* Some have called this the ""[fluff principle](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html),"" following Paul Graham's usage. I prefer to think of it as the ""conveyor belt problem,"" since that both avoids value judgments about the content that rises and evokes the mechanism that causes the rise.

Given some basic familiarity with how the site works, there's been enough skepticism to allow others to outright deny its validity, or to downplay its significance, so I decided to put the idea to the test. To that end, I used Python to build a simulation of Reddit in order to run a few scenarios related to vote time.

Before I could run the simulation, real world numbers. So I wrote [another script](http://redd.it/1h5f3f), this one designed to help me estimate the median amount of time it takes redditors to vote on different types of submission. This post will cover the results of that experiment; I'll get to the full simulation in a subsequent post.

## Content categories

Submissions were drawn from 11 different subs, /r/AskScience, /r/books, /r/comics, /r/gaming, /r/pics, /r/politics, /r/TrueReddit

By looking at the submission itself (or, I was able to derive the following categories:

Content type | Median eval. time | Explanation | Example domain
:--- | :---: | :--- | ---:
Standard image | 325 seconds | Original
Familiarity-based image | 243 seconds | Image macros and [FIXED] | livememe.com
Longform images | 1400 second | Multi-focus images, albums | imgur.com
Video | 508 seconds | You know… videos | youtube.com
Self (all types combined) | 286 seconds| Reddit-hosted text-only posts | self.reddit.com
Title-centric self | 275 seconds | self.posts that can be evaluated by title alone | self.AskReddit
Thread-centric self | 575 seconds | self.posts evaluated on the basis of the body or comment text | self.AskScience
Articles (inverted pyramid) | 353 seconds | Articles structured to foreground important info | reuters.com 
Articles (essay style) | 522 seconds | Articles structured to gradually reveal important info | theatlantic.com

Finally, for example, links to sales pages, a few links that were apparently posted in error. Incidentally, all of the overt spam collected came from a single sub: /r\/worldnews.

## Analysis

Right off the bat, image albums) has the longest evaluation times of the bunch. One possible explanation could be that a relatively small sample size has skewed the median. Another might be that the category encompasses too broad a variety of content types, from albums with only a few images, to multipage comics. Click-through time almost certainly plays a part, since these links usually can't be evaluated on the basis of a thumbnail image alone. Two related explanations strike me as particularly likely. One is that evaluation times simply rise when you have to ""read"" an unfamiliar image, and especially so with a set of images. The other is that, given the comparatively higher investment required by longform images, then the long interval is due less to the amount of time actually need to evaluate the submission than it is to a relatively high proportion of users skipping longform image submissions altogether. Short of a test that can isolate the actual reason

Another result is that the self.post category actually breaks along natural lines into two categories, I'm calling one set *title-centric* and the other *thread-centric*, though I fully admit that those names are burdened with interpretation.

For the most part, but the brevity of the articles themselves make it unlikely that anyone really took a full 15 minutes deciding how to vote. If we exclude those entries then the median shifts downward by more than a minute:

Content type | Median eval. time | Example domain
:--- | :---: | ---:
Articles (inverted pyramid) | 275 seconds | reuters.com 

However, and leaves open the possibility that voter apathy is a structural hazard of the inverted pyramid type of article.

Finally, the ratio of up to down votes is approximately 50/50 when we're looking at first votes alone. I suspect that holds true for the new queue in general. That doesn't contradict Ketralnis' data, though. The most likely explanation is simply that up votes are that much more common on the front page and user home pages, where the majority of voting takes place and most spam, reposts and off-topic content have already been filtered by the Knights of the new.

\* Things have changed a bit over at /r\/AdviceAnimals since these trials. Previously one of the most frequently used meme generator sites, if at all—[jokes_on_you's explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/cao99l6) seems to suggest that the vote manipulation took place mostly in the morning, so maybe the trials simply missed the times when the bot was active. Or maybe the bot simply wasn't the first vote in most cases. At any rate, when we extract the quickmeme votes from the rest of the set, you can see first votes for the quickmeme domains were up votes only slightly more than 50% of the time, which is an acceptable margin of deviation from the 50/50 ratio that holds for /r\/AdviceAnimals specifically and most new queue votes in general.

The video was removed from YouTube

Two points of discussion:

1) We know that appending ""[fixed]"" to posts is usually out of humor (as an aside

2) Further, New York Times), users are more likely to upvote corrections (probably because they're seen as important) and users that subscribe to a wider variety of subreddits are more likely to post those corrections (eg., potentially one aspect of 'more experienced' reddit users) [see bottom of p. 6 for relevant stats]. I'd venture to say that these types of corrections are particularly important because it's hard to validate content on reddit (due to the nature of the technical limitations of the site's architecture), and visibility can easily be manipulated for all types of content (correct or incorrect) solely based on voting behaviors (and additionally, some mods choose to keep up incorrect information because of the discussion that occurs in the comments). Finally, there's a grey area around reddiquette where users are not encouraged to solicit upvotes for content, ""downvote humor so relevant information can become visibile to those who need it!"" kind of messages

I used to submit my webcomics to reddit about a year ago. Back then, and those that were very poor. The latter were also engaged with more often. People would leave comments like ""really good effort!"", and other encouraging praise. 

There was always a gap, very funny comics (not just my own, but yes, I am somewhat arrogantly including mine in this grouping) which were being downvoted. My theory is that people assumed that these quality comics were already popular elsewhere, so they didn't need the ""boost"" of encouragement that was being given to the poorer comics. As a result, the top submissions in /r/webcomics and /r/comics were almost always a mix of poorly drawn, unfunny comics and well-established gems.

I don't draw my comic any more because I don't have the time and it eventually became less rewarding

Is this a delusion of mine, artists, etc. being downvoted, and I can't help but be reminded of the Louis CK bit (apologies if it seems circle-jerky to invoke him) where he talks about nobody praising him for what he does, and that everyone says something to the effect of ""yeah, so what, that's your job.""

Because I'm on summer break and have plenty of free time

* Create two accounts. One would be used to lose karma

* See how quickly I could reach -2000 karma on the first account

For my negative karma account, I simply posted or replied to people on popular subreddits' threads about things most Redditors hate while being a pompous ass and overusing smiley faces. In about 50 hours, I had received 2000 downvotes.

For my positive karma account, but with things Redditors like to read, that it was much easier to make karma than it was to lose karma. I quickly became bored with the account. It wasn't as much of a challenge. I stopped posting after a couple hours, and went back to check the account every hour or so. In about twenty hours, I had received 2000 upvotes.

**CONCLUSION:** It is much more difficult to lose karma than it is to gain karma. In fact

I also theorize larger subreddits are not as fun to read because of all the people trying to karma whore. You get the same posts upvoted time and time again, but simply share their ideas, thoughts, or stories. Sure, the picture might be reposted, but the discussion of the picture will be completely different the second time.

As you might guess, spawning an unknown number of subreddits for anything related to the PLounge. The 100 or so active users there have honest relationships with one another from all the conversations they've had. While, I don't participate as much in subreddits like /r/askreddit, it seems the more active users there don't have much of a communal relationship, and if they do, it's drowned out by the immense amount of other users. PLounge power-users have made it the [18th most commented subreddit on an average day,](http://stattit.com/r/mlplounge/) with over 6000 comments

While the PLounge does fall to similar sarcastic jokes that any subreddit seems to fall to

What makes the PLounge such a stand out case could be a result of various reasons. One is that the mods enjoy messing with the subreddit. The header, and since there's over 7000 emotes, individual ones don't get overused and obnoxious. The other reason I can think of is the approach the community has towards new users. The power users welcome new users into their community no matter what kind of person they are. People can honestly admit to being a furry, enjoying pony porn, or any other social taboo and it's ok. Lastly, there's no thought towards karma. It's a low karma subreddit, thus nobody tries to be a ""karmawhore""

Yesterday [soapyluggage](http://www.reddit.com/user/soapyluggage) (one of the moderators of r/skyrim) ~~made~~ announced [this highly unpopular change in the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf027/update_to_the_subreddit_rules/), each one downvoted to Oblivion (ha).

There have been two response posts ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf9je/hey_moderators_i_really_like_single_picture_posts/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mfoiv/motion_to_demod_soapyluggage/)) drumming up support for turning over the rule and removing soapyluggage as a mod - the first with 2126 upvotes

This is obviously quite the overreaction, it seems the community is dealing with a new rule in a very immature way.

Just by my own observations

1. Upvotes/downvotes are the best method of moderation

2. Mods shouldn't care about karma whoring

Number 1 is something I've had to argue against before in r/minecraft, which is why moderators have to step in to keep the community alive.

That actually feeds into my second annoyance: mods generally don't care about karma-whoring, but if the entire frontpage of a subreddit is dominated by memes that add nothing to the community, then problems arise. 

I, and is a good way of keeping the one-click bullshit away while still allowing images that actually add something. Unfortunately, the community response is indicative of how misinformation and immaturity can easily combat quality control.

EDIT: Let me reiterate that I am not voicing my support of this particular rule; to be honest, I doubt it will get anywhere. 

EDIT2: Another r/skyrim moderator, along with the fact that soapyluggage has decided to resign as a mod of r/skyrim (which I find ridiculous, but it's his own decision). A huge lack of popular support will do that to you. I still applaud the mods for attempting to reign in their fast-growing subreddit, even if the rule implemented was not the most effective approach.

So a reddit convention doesn't really appeal to me.

* heavy focus on arbitrary numbers (4chan has post count; reddit has karma)

Reddit has, I've recently noticed the upward trend of ""my face when"" posts, commonly abbreviated MFW. These are a type of reaction shot popularized on 4chan, and usually accompanied by a short phrase, such as ""MFW you just lost the game"". For illustrative purposes, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hxmge/this_is_my_reaction_when_i_get_three_upvotes/) is a current frontpage post that fits the bill.

What causes this parallel growth? Is it simply a function of an overlapping userbase?  Is it a result of both user driven content combined with user interface lending itself more toward picture driven posts? Or something else entirely? I personally lean toward the latter. Reddit is unique in that it supports image upload thumbnails next to the headlines. Fark doesn't support this, but it never manifested any of those similar traits. They appear to be exclusive to Reddit and 4chan. Perhaps it's related to the size and position of the thumbnail. Digg's image thumbs are noticeably smaller overall, and awkwardly placed to the right of the text where I suspect it tends to go unnoticed.

**Anonymity and good/bad conversation on reddit**
On reddit, and I would argue, responsibility.  The anonymity gives a redditor the freedom to be a complete dicktroll, and antagonize everybody.  It also gives people the opportunity to make a stupid joke, that oftentimes wouldn't be made in person because it is so off-topic, rude, or crude that they wouldn't say it to people IRL.  But on the internet it is funny, I digress.  

But the anonymity also is what makes reddit great.  It is a safe place, acquaintances, family, and friends.  Your ideas on homosexuality will not jeopardize your job security, or your standing on the PTO.  *I think this is great, and allows a lot of different viewpoints to be expressed in various subreddits.*  

**reddit discussion vs. Facebook discussion**
What prompted my interest in this topic, but more often than not, the quality of the conversation is worse than that found in the halls of middle schools around the world.  

What is it that makes reddit better than Facebook in the realm of discussion?  Is it just the anonymous voice that we all get to speak with?  Or is there something more?  Maybe it is the communities that we find.  Someone disgusted with rising consumerism finds [/r/anticonsumption](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption) and finds a group of people that really understand them.

Rather than going through an extensive list of those problems

1. Consolidate and clarify rule sets;

2. Rely more heavily on the various moderation bots provided by industrious users (at least until the admins get around to implementing those functions natively);

3. Reduce the number of moderators in most subs – in some cases

The third of those recommendations is the most critical – the other two are there mostly in support. The prevailing theory of moderation over the last several years has been that subs need a large complement of mods

There are two problems with that point of view. One is that large moderator groups tend to be very bad at decision-making. They deliberate interminably over matters of policy when a timely, a sub would be better served by two or three responsible and active mods making clear-cut decisions and explaining those decisions to the community, rather than a half-dozen or more mods attempting to maintain the cohesiveness of a sub by bureaucracy or committee.**

The second problem is that

That's where recommendations 1 and 2 come in. Moderation bots have automated a lot of the tasks that necessitated a small army of moderators. Clear and concise rules can further reduce the work load on moderators by making it easier for users to understand the boundaries of relevant content and making the task of judging relevance easier for mods.

Whether or not these recommendations are practicable is something we can discuss in the comments, no matter how reasonable the course I've outlined.

The goal then, users who enjoy meme posts (pending the moderator's rules of the Gold only subreddit).  If a rule is broken, a person could be tagged with strikes, or straight out subreddit banned according to the moderator's rules.

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week

Here is this week's topic:

## How could reddit give users more control over what items appear on their frontpage?

**Discussion**  

We previously spent some time [discussing how reddit could improve its algorithms to generate a better frontpage](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1j0z2r/admin_level_change_thought_experiment_week_04/). Here I'd like to discuss ways that users could directly improve their frontpage experience

* *Pinned subreddits:*

I am personally subscribed to over 200 subreddits - far more than even my Reddit gold subscription allows me to see at once. This means that on any given view of my frontpage

Now, I'd like to see my university subreddit on my frontpage all the time. Same for other subreddits I moderate, and those that particularly interest me. Others I might find entertaining, but don't need to see every post.

Having the ability to ""pin to frontpage"" would be one way to accomplish this.

* *Multireddit priority:*

But what if we take this one step further? With the introduction of multireddits, ""Medium"", ""Low"" to affect the frequency of subreddits in that multi making it to our frontpage.

* *Moderator stickies:*

Another aspect of this to consider involves the newly added moderator ""Sticky post"" feature. Right now, and allow usuers to more directly subscribe to moderator threads (useful, for example, with many tv show discussion threads).

* *How else could this be accomplished?*

This is our weekly admin level discussion thread

**Preface**

*Welcome to our weekly ""Admin-Level Change"" thought experiment. Each week

Here is this week's topic:

##What if the admins changed your privacy options on Reddit?

**Discussion**

In this post we will be focusing on a hot topic in the cultural zeitgeist today. Without a doubt the Reddit community has strong, opinions and discussion about admin level actions that relate to your privacy while on reddit. 

You can approach this subject several different ways with this. Privacy is all about give and take. In the U.S. we often give up bits of privacy for all sorts of different reasons. For example, on Reddit you can hide the information you up and down vote, but not your entire profile. We all have privacy through the use of pseudonyms, however, the majority of your actions on reddit are publicly recorded and can identify a user if they are not careful. 

Should the admins create more tools to further ensure the privacy of the users? If so

As food for thought

- Anonymous posting without throwaways
- The ability to remove your username from a comment without deleting it
- The ability to completely hide user pages or
- The ability to delete your entire history with one click

Do you support any of these ideas? If so

On the other side of the coin

- The ability for mods to view the user who reports a submission
- Remove the ability for users to hide up and down votes
- Add native tagging to further identify users like in RES
- Give the mods the ability to natively flag a user with a tag that only the mods could see

Would you support any of these options? How would you defend taking away a little privacy for ""the greater good""? What other thoughts or suggestions might you have in this regard? 

If you would like more information about Reddit's privacy policy you can read the whole thing [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy). To their credit

1372455203.0,1h9w4q,Using Python to simulate the effects of the new queue on Reddit's submission ranking system (pt. 3),blackstar9000,63,21,15,"This is the third of a series of posts testing the hypothesis that *the structure of the new queue gives a competitive advantage to submissions that link directly to image files*.

[In the second in the series](http://redd.it/1h7r54), and strangely (3) tilt the balance in favor of more slowly evaluated submissions in subs between those two extremes.

## Why that ain't necessarily so

The baseline tests do a pretty good job of simulating how evaluation time effects front page ranking when all else is equal, that means they each get caught evaluating long form images at one point or another, which takes them out of the loop for more than 23 minutes of simulation time. Particularly when you crank up the rate of submissions, that means that long form images cast a long shadow, preventing snoos from voting on other types of content altogether, and especially in the new queue where the votes effectively count for more.

In reality

To do that, based on which page they used to view submissions. Snoos on the front page voted up eighty percent of the time and down the rest; those on the new queue alternated between up, down, and none. The new method attribute allowed me to specify that a certain percentage of snoos on each page would vote according to their own specified method.

Unfortunately, trials at the upper end (2,200 snoos and a 50 second rate) took 8-10 hours to complete.

For that reason, it's entirely probable that someone more seasoned can figure out a way to optimize the code so that it doesn't take so long at the upper range, so we may yet see this experiment repeated on the full range of possible subs.

## The Quick and the Dead

To make sense of the results of the baseline tests

[This first chart](http://i.imgur.com/0jiADPa.png) shows the front page after seven days with the sub divided equally between snoos who vote only on quick-vote submissions and snoos who only vote on slow-vote submissions. If you're having trouble seeing the distribution, when there's an even division between users who want particular content types, those whose content types take less time to evaluate win outright.

That's a pretty sharp division, and snoos who vote on everything that comes down the pike. You can see that the disparity is not as sharp, but the majority of posts still come from the quick end of the spectrum. That's especially notable if, as yesterday's data suggested, subs of that size and level of activity tend to favor slow-vote content when everyone votes the same way.

Let's take it down one more notch. [The third chart](http://i.imgur.com/ZgkLSbX.png) shows day seven with a quarter quick-vote, but it does seem to expand the middle range at the expense of the extremes.

So far, while everyone else votes on whatever shows up on the front page: quick-vote content takes over. Pay careful attention to that. It means that *25 people have effectively determined the overall direction of the front page in a sub with several thousand voters.*

But we can amp that up. [Here's what happens](http://i.imgur.com/F40PQ6T.png) when half of the new queue only votes on quick-vote material, but watch what happens when [only the front page is partisan](http://i.imgur.com/bgsMTsd.png). Quick-vote submissions still dominate, because evaluation time matters.

## The Meme Knave

Those tests deal specifically with investment time

To test that scenario, I've taken to thinking of those voters as ""meme knaves""—that is, users who benefit from the site's structure at the expense of a majority that's content to see a broader variety of content types.

[Here's what happens to a moderately active sub when a proportion of its active voters start to ignore everything but memes](http://i.imgur.com/UdqMsMv.png). The trend from 10% (i.e. 55 meme knaves) to 25% (i.e. 138 meme knaves) is clear. Even with as few as [10 meme knaves in the new queue](http://i.imgur.com/E0kzTlK.png)

## Conclusions

So what does all of that mean? You might recall that our hypothesis was that *the structure of the new queue gives a competitive advantage to submissions that link directly to image files*. It turns out that's not entirely true. Yesterday's results suggest that there might be a slight shift at the extremes of activity

After 3 months of inactivity, clearly warning them that they have 3 months left before their subreddit is deleted. 2 weeks before the subreddit is deleted, an automated post is made to it saying that there are 2 weeks left before deletion. This post must get 25 (or another number if that works better) upvotes or else the subreddit will be deleted.

Sure, the most flagrant of things will be downvoted and/or deleted. But marketers are people too, and will endlessly endeavor to be clever enough to put their advertising under the radar.

This is ultimately why I decided to hand the subreddit over to VA. He is an experienced moderator, which will provide the yin to this subreddit's yang.

1316342468.0,kjfo0,Where do the votes come from?,IAmAnAnonymousCoward,53,13,22,"In the discussion of whether subreddit communities moderate themselves or not

Let's look at the places a submission can theoretically receive votes from:

* From within the subreddit it's posted to.

* From reddit.com (the front page).

* From /r/all.

* From the OP's user page and from /r/friends.

(Did I miss anything

Now the question is: Who is most likely to care about the context of a submission?

**\*** I'd say those browsing the subreddit definitely care about the context. If users browsing the subreddit don't care whether a submission is off-topic or not

One important aspect is that in small and medium size subreddits, then this matters.

**\*** It gets more interesting in reddit.com. Ignoring the defaults

Another interesting aspect is that reddit.com is the only place where subreddits are weighted. This means that the smaller a subreddit

**\*** Let's say users browsing /r/all don't care about context. I think that's a safe bet. But does it matter? Only submissions that already have a ton of upvotes make it there. Of course there's /r/all/new

**\*** User pages are very interesting. I doubt that too many users browse them

My implicit assumption is that the early votes decide on the fate of a submission

For example: I posted http://thisiswhatblogspamlookslike.wordpress.com to illustrate what ""blogspam"" is

This was also in a defaultesque subreddit

On the other hand, since presumably people click the link *before* viewing the comments given that the headline was what interested you in the first place. Though there's also a contingent that clicks the comments *before* the links -- people on news/politics subreddits who are used to sensationalist headlines and feel that comment sections ""cut through the bullshit.""

I suspect that when you're on a main page and not the comment jungle (i.e. you don't have to click ""continue"") the 20-40 estimate will hold true

One way that smaller subreddits combat this is by using aggressive moderation. With the help of encouraging users to report unwanted posts and comments, it loses some control over quality.

For example
&gt; So you're looking for a description of underage girl rape and your name is CardiacMolest...  
&gt; I kid. No idea about the article though good luck.  

However

Even if the old userbase would be against a username joke, it's up to the mods to delete the post, or for the new users to somehow be educated about standards. Regarding education, users can generally bring themselves up-to-date by just browsing a subreddit for a while. Alternatively, there are rules on the sidebar. However, we see that this isn't enough since large subreddits still degrade.

So, a lot of the comments on these threads seem to disagree with the premise and get annoyed by the threads. As the number of users that dislike these 'reminder/education/discussion' threads increases, the less effective and more ignored they will be.

So how do we combat this and keep a subreddit's purpose specific? If a subreddit can be split to different subreddits (/r/gore, but that isn't always an option, because sometimes a subreddit is about as specific as it needs to be. I guess another option is to use the /r/TrueReddit style subreddits.

The easy reaction is ""look at the conspiratards who think this must have been arranged in secret by the U.S. military! ho ho ho"" but frankly they don't even surprise me any more. What did astonish me was the equal viciousness of personal attacks in the other direction - against people who refuse to support the soldiers any more than they support the wars. Basically, overall, than the admins anticipated - there are very strong feelings on both sides.

One way of reading this is, a new ""Support Our Troops"" meme spread like wildfire throughout the mainstream media. Even now, Stephen Colbert gets reliably unironic when he speaks about giving financial or verbal support to his country's armed forces. It's basically been treated as a totally nonpartisan good cause that everyone can agree on, even if they oppose the wars. So you can see why someone in that culture might think it's a great idea for a charity drive that won't offend anyone.

Obviously that sentiment doesn't apply on reddit. So my question for ToR is

The internet often goes a different way from pop culture, drug legalization, Ron Paul, and cats - most of the viewpoints expressed on the internet about these issues are hard to imagine hearing on American TV news, even in the context of a debate.

First, is more of an experiment than just a karma whoring pyramid scheme thingy.  The thing is, karma is produced.  It doesn't change hands, like money does.  So we can easily just produce it with this system.

What the experiment is trying to see is, karma can easily be produced with no effort, earning a reward for nothing.  The 'real world' uses currency, which changes hands.

1309146334.0,ia0r5,Why Shorter is Better,alexanderwales,49,11,10,"This is a theory that I've had for awhile

Let's imagine a hypothetical subreddit devoted to widgets, reads, and votes on content which can be consumed in ten seconds.  The second group is similar, but their content takes about two minutes to get through.  Lastly, the third group favors content which takes at least a half-hour.  For simplicity, these three groups never vote on each others' content.  Also for simplicity's sake, we'll assume that they all have equal populations.

If ten pieces of content are submitted to each of the three groups, twenty minutes, and for group three, five hours.  Because of the way ""hot"" ranking works^\*, this means that the frontpage of /r/widgets will at first be dominated by the ""fast"" group, with ""medium"" and ""long"" groups eventually moving into place once the entire population of the subreddit has finished voting.  This would be fine if we were creating a ""best of"" list, because it would mean that eventually everything would settle into place.

However, this might not be such a problem; a short piece of content might move to the top faster, but eventually the medium and short pieces would catch up.  However, in a fast moving subreddit, or in the context of many other subreddits, this is not the case, primarily due to visibility.  Since we read top to bottom, and thus most likely to get upvoted, while mixing together subreddits does account for *size*

All this is said while putting aside the other competitive advantages that short content tends to have

 * People tend to have short attention spans

 * Short content is better able to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  A five page opinion piece almost by necessity will have a nuanced view, while almost everyone will be able to understand a ""blogspam"" post about that paper.  Shorter means simpler, and that means a wider appeal.

 * The initial dominance of short content creates a feedback loop.  More images (for example) on the front-page will attract people who like images and repulse people who don't like images, the feedback loop gets a jumpstart.

 * Thumbnails give a huge advantage to images

The question that naturally follows is, which (as shown above) will tend to favor shorter content, even without a change in the make-up of the userbase, though most people will tell you that this has happened.  The second part of that would be the above mentioned feedback effect.  Since reddit displays the ten largest subreddits to new users, new users are first being exposed to the subreddits which are most heavily affected by the bias towards short content, which further skews the userbase.

This is intended mostly as a reference, let me know, and I'll edit it in - I've long thought that /r/TheoryOfReddit needs something like an FAQ section so that we can start constructing an actual corpus of knowledge (rather than talking about things without the aim towards ordering that knowledge).

1356718374.0,15kyz7,Som things I've noticed about internet communities [long],freework,52,13,7,"A few years ago I was a member of a forum called JetCareers. It was (is) a forum dedicated to the aviation career track. Al the users there are either working as professional pilots

When I first joined that community in 2006

That was back when the JetCareers community was still growing. The site launched, as well as to engage the community in issues that I felt needed attention.

Sometime around 2007 I stopped using that community. It had really changed. I was no longer useful to me. Here is what happened:

First off, and there was no real core ""community"" so to speak of. There were no ""regulars"". In the early days, you didn't even pay attention to the name associated with the post because it was assumed that everyone was on the same level, knowledge-wise.

But as time went on

That core group of people weren't even the most knowledgeable. They were, and that friendship resulted in real job opportunities. So becoming part of the ""in group"" became extremely desirable.

By 2008 the site was completely and utterly useless for the purpose of learning about aviation. The community had become a circle-jerk to the extreme. Back in those days, how are things up in Buffalo. Do you like your new job"", ""Oh yeah I love it, It's great, say hi to Tammy for me"" -- That kind of thing. If you were an insider, this kind of chatter appeals to you. If you're just there to read about aviation, it was frustrating.

Some people want to learn. Some people want to belong. Reddit was founded by people who,000 (~50 posts per day, iirc). Everyone agreed with him. He was an airline pilot at Delta, and he was known to recommend his friends from that forum for job openings when they came up.

The life cycle of internet communities:

1. Community is founded
2. Community thrives by fostering great intellectual discussions by attracting the right type of person (this step is mostly driven by luck)
3. Community develops a reputation of being the ""place to be""
4. Said reputation attracts users who want to be ""where it is""
5. Community changes from ""awesome community to learn"" to ""awesome community to be popular and accepted into""
6. No one cares about the discussion anymore

Things that reddit does right:

1. Things are fairly anonymous. You can make sock puppet accounts. Your real life name is separate from your ""reddit life"".
2. Moderators stay in the background. Places where moderators are front and center (Something Awful) have the problem where is a bad apple moderator badly effects the community because people take after bad moderators. Everybody wants power and acceptance. Its part of human nature. If the mod is an ashole
3. Allows meta discussion. Most shitty forums forbid discussion about why the forum has become shitty. Something Awful used to famously ban anyone who dared criticize any moderation decision. Thank god reddit doesn't do that.

Things reddit does wrong:

1. Karma points. People will posts just to get the karma
2. Default subreddits are the shittiest

Thats it. I think reddit does a pretty good job of managing communities. Reddit isn't perfect, socialism to get to democracy, we'll have to go through many different ""internet discussion government techniques"" to arrive to a system that is nearly perfect.

2. There was a significant correction effect on comments that appeared to be negatively received
3. There was no significant long term difference in the final mean score of a downvoted vs. neutral comment.
4. A comment with an apparent vote on it (2|0) or (1|1) is more likely to receive a second vote (positive herding or correction) as it seems to draw attention to those comments (speculative by authors)
5. People are more likely to upvote ""friends"" who have a positive RES score next to their name versus ""enemies"". This was also an interacting variable with whether the score was positive

For many people

However

There is a collection of subs forming some kind of unholy trinity, it's not really a trinity, because TheoryOfReddit fits into the same category.

These subs are different from the usual Reddit sub because they are completely inner-directed, a single thread can create linked lists of submissions several layers deep.

Because the linking of outside material almost never happens on these subs, as it happens only within Reddit.  Because doxxing is disallowed, all of this content is completely unverifiable.

This leaves a situation where almost nothing can be assigned a truth value.  It is *all* uncertain.

As trolls gain more experience

For those who experienced the sisterofblackvisions troll, when it was revealed to be a deception, the whole horrible situation imploded in on itself, with the whole experience being shown to have existed only on Reddit after all (except for the death of one real human being, who remains unknown).


I just find this a fascinating situation to contemplate ... hundreds of human beings communicating with each other

What I am asking is


So,"" which generates more traffic to the videos already at the top. When you come on Reddit, on the front page are a small number of links that have been upvoted thousands of times. Meaning that which is already popular is going to become more popular on account of its popularity. Music stations will play the top 10 songs because they are in the top 10. In a sense this related to group think, seeing ""Oh, so many people like this, so it must be good, so I will like it too.""
