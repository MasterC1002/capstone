First and foremost

I started Reddit Water over two years ago, and when talking about water issues put people straight to sleep at parties. Which it still does, but one thing at a time.

So it's a small reward to reach 1, and ""blue greens,"" to name a few of the readership's occupations (that I know of).

I try to follow about [forty-eight water blogs](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F11714933878999847100%2Fbundle%2Fwater) and a dozen or so Google News Alerts

Our relationship with water is a vast topic; I recently explained to one reader [why I posted an article on a fire department draining a pond to fight a rural fire](http://www.reddit.com/r/water/comments/gfr98/firefighters_use_pond_water_to_fight_house_fire/c1nm9zd?context=3):

&gt; I try to post a variety of articles; in this case

&gt; Providing hydrants, and in the contract with the city there was no requirement to supply water for fires (it was ""optional,"" iirc).

&gt; For /r/water my view is one that's kind of holistic: the ""wholeness that's way too big

To that last point, but I leave that to Aquafornia (see our sidebar). Egypt and her neighboring nations are fighting over the Nile. Nebraska and Kansas, over the Republican River. A beached barge leaks in the Columbia River, requiring millions of federal dollars to clean it up. Billions of gallons of raw sewage flow into the Great Lakes every time there's heavy rain, while at the same time coal plants pump mercury into them, Asian carp threaten to get in, and algae blooms cause safety hazards.

This is just a small sample of ""the wholeness that's way too big."" Our relationship with water is intimate
