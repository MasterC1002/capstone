I'm the director, co-founder and one of many voices of DragonBall Z Abridged, a simple online parody of DragonBall Z using the footage to essentially edit it down to digestible chunks while changing the dialogue, music, etc. to ultimately make it a comedy.

The team behind it is called TeamFourStar

This is the day we have all been waiting for!!!! I want to thank each and every one of you for staying with us. We have had plenty of rough patches and a couple scandals but we pulled through. In the past few months this subreddits quality has increased far more than what we expected. I love you all.

Not too far from now

I'd like to thank our newest moderators, and Jax for making r/dbz more than what I thought it was going to be. I truly am grateful and I can't wait to see what we can pull off in the future.
_________________________________________________________

NEW FEATURES COMING SOON!

* We understand our episode discussions are lacking slightly. So every first Wednesday of the month we are going to have a Movie discussion! Hopefully it will spice a few things up.

* Art contests!!! We are fully aware a lot of you don't like traces of SSJ2 Gohan and Majin Vegeta. So starting soon we are going to have a monthly art contest. Every contest will have some sort of theme so it won't always be traces off Google images. I'm talking about pumpkin carvings

* MORE FLAIR. I've been getting messages about once a week asking for more flair. Don't worry. It's coming.",self,t5_2sdu8,1350960078.0,,ZZHalo,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/comments/11x4iy/over_9000_subscribers/

We don't need to see your fan art. Odds are, and it's really just filler.

We also don't need to know who would win in a fight between Goku and **X**. Unless it's Dr. Manhattan

Your DBZ soda cans are cool, and reposting them. 

Please, plenty of untapped in-universe topics, and just general franchise discussion. Look at the Kanzenshuu forums if you don't believe me.
