That's tolerable at the start and midgame, watching the attack drones so they don't get to destroy the ship, sending your Engis to repair your ship and opening airlocks to put out fires, it's quite probable that you forget to unfocus the ion bomb, losing your only missile ioning the shields that were already offline.

So I think that you should be able to put autofire to single weapons. That would give you much better control when you are doing a lot of things at a time. There should also be a button to enable autofire in everything and another to disable autofire in everything

So check it out if it lists things that have been causing you problems or if you feel like being helpful and testing

Changelog 1.02

**Compatibility Changes:**

* Older laptops experiencing ""overly pixelated"" or distorted images should now function

**Fullscreen Changes:**

* Fullscreen stretch now works differently and should be more effective at properly ""stretching"" to fill your screen
* Monitors that support 2560x1440 should be properly scaling and look much better (I'm jealous)
* Monitors with resolutions less than 1280x720 may now function in Fullscreen Stretched depending on your * OpenGL support
* A more elaborate manual mode is available for tweaking your desired resolution effect within settings.ini

**Additional Video Settings:**

* V-Sync can be activated within options mode. Depending on your system
* Frame limiting is also available from the options. Between the two (V-Sync vs. Frame Limiting)

**Additional Game Settings:**

* Within options you can enable paths to be drawn when hovering over a beacon.
* Dialog keys will now have a brief delay before they are active

**Other Bugs:**

* Start Crash Fix: Sometimes unidentified USB devices could cause FTL to fail to start
* Removed bugged weapon from the secret sector
* Moving crewmembers will still teleport assuming they are in the room of their final destination
* Killing the crew of an enemy ship will count as defeating it for stats
* Selling the Zoltan Energy shield will no longer be bugged
* Federation Ship will properly unlock on victory (and will unlock retroactively for those that experienced this bug)
* Secret Cruiser Type B stealth imagery has been fixed
* Fixed situation where a defense drone could become permanently powered
* Energy Shield can no longer be damaged while jumping
* Fixed: Ion Storm and Nebula effects would disappear at beacons where you leave behind an enemy

There has been some debate over what's better.  Engines
You see lots of players running around with 4 shields and 3 engines.  Some players will swear by upgrading engines first.  

I decided to figure out what is best.  **MATH TIME.**

***

I decided to look **just** at laser defense for this.  For missiles

If you've got 3 shields and 0% dodge

If you've got 3 shields and 25% dodge, so it's **like** you have four shield bars and no dodge.  Thus, you have 4 ES.  

If you've got 3 shields and 50% dodge

If you've got 3 shields and 75% dodge

***

**[From there, 375.  But the 3 engine case has 6.12 ES while the 4 engine case has 6.67 ES.  Therefore, if you had just 375 scrap to spend on defenses and just cared about blocking lasers, the four shield case would be better.

***

Another neat little thing I did was to check out the scrap cost per ES for each configuration.  If you sort by this, starting at 1 shield, 2 engines, is:

* 1 shield, 0 scrap/ES)
* 1 shield, 9.75 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 21.13 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 28.50 scrap/ES)
* 2 shield, 37.13 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 43.08 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 51.13 scrap/ES)
* 3 shield, 61.25 scrap/ES)
* 4 shield, 67.99 scrap/ES)
* 4 shield, 75.94 scrap/ES)

***

So, in general, it looks like a balanced build is best, with some very minor preference to engines.  

Of course, and no amount of math is gonna change my mind).  But this just goes to show you that something like, say, 4 shields 2 engines is **not** as good as something balanced like 3 shields, 6 engines.",,False,t5_2tnu1,True

I'm no expert but I have beaten the game a few times; anyone else who's played through should feel free to contribute in the comments.

- Don't use auto-fire. It's better to concentrate fire from multiple weapons all at once so you don't have to worry about taking out enemy shields every single time you shoot every weapon. If you're being really tricky

- You can watch the weapons mounted on the enemy ship for a clue about when they'll fire. The red lights on the weapons will gradually turn green

- The effects of powering/unpowering systems is immediate\*. You can (ab)use this in various ways, and then cloak or turn on a defense drone before it hits you in order to avoid the impact.

      \* (This does not hold true for shields

      ** (If you turn off a drone when it's ready to fire (green) it should still be ready to fire when it comes back online

- The door system is your friend vs. boarding parties. If you think you're overmatched

- ""Build Order"": With the Kestral (starter ship) I usually get 2 shields first, and a good cloak by the final sector. I also like having a good bomb if possible.

- **Edit:** I also would recommend not fixing up your ship to full every chance you get. A number of events can result in some free/cheap repairs and these are wasted if you bought the pricey repairs at a shop. Likewise, so early on I prefer to prioritize those.",,False,,t5_2tnu1,1347746329.0,ftlgame-flairHUMANMALE,

Getting 1HP achievement:

1. Set on easy
2. Grab Kestrel, who will be your #1 threat.
3. SAVE YOUR SCRAP.  Aim for 100 scrap.
4. Fly around until you find a store.
5. Fly around until you find an asteroid belt.
6. Quickly destroy the enemy ship.  Place two crewmen in the engine room and keep your pilot in the pilot seat.
7. DISABLE YOUR SHIELD
8. Let the asteroids bombard your ship.  They will come slowly
9. As the last asteroid comes (to get from 2 hull to 1), your shield will protect you until you can jump out.
10.  Jump and hit the store you saw earlier.  Spend your scrap en mass.

Getting full systems achievement:

1. Set on easy
2. Grab Kestrel, who will be your #1 threat.
3. SAVE YOUR SCRAP.  You will need a minimum of 300 (305?) scrap.  You will also probably need to spend some on repairs or fuel
4. Do nothing except hoard scrap.  Always accept surrenders
5. SELL EVERYTHING except for your Artemis and Burst Laser.  Unless you get a better weapon that only uses 1/2 energy, Crew Transporter, and Drone Control System.
6. If necessary
7. YOU DO NOT NEED TO POWER THE SUBSYSTEMS.  You do not need one power for transporter

I know that the full systems one is straightforward but some people were confused by what the achievement meant.  And some people were wondering an easier way to get the 1-hp achievement,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,ftlgame-flairZOLTAN,t3_zxgxg

1348236769.0,108yap,[Strategy] Ion Blast Mark II - build your ship around it and you'll easily sail to victory.,,97,14,50,"For the Kickstarter crowd, most of them involving this weapon on a broad variety of ships

What do Ion weapons do? They tempoarily disable systems they hit; if they hit shields, 5 or zoltan shields (ion deals double damage against those), since the sooner shields are gone or lowered, the sooner you can start dealing real damage.

Now, and most of them have mediocre recharge rates. But there's one exception.

[The Ion Blast Mark II](http://i.imgur.com/yijqD.jpg)

Notice the *4 second* charge time? With a veteran crewmember on the guns, a shield bar drops. *This is faster than most ships can re-activate their shields!* Which means that this weapon doesn't just temporarily lower enemy shields - it can take down enemy shields *entirely*. The shield bars vanish faster than the system replenishes, i.e. after a couple of shots fired, they'll be down to just one or maybe even zero shields. At that point, your ion starts hitting their subystems, taking those out (or, if you've targeted their shields

With a requirement of 3 power and a price tag of 80 scrap, surprise, a lot of people feel that that ship is one of the more powerful ships out there). 

Due to the rapid fire rate, e.g. shields -&gt; weapons -&gt; shields -&gt; bridge -&gt; shields -&gt; weapons etc. That way, multiple subsystems can be taken out simultaneously. If you're really cruel (and patient), just ion down their Oxygen and let them suffocate (there's an achievement for that, too).

Should you happen to get *two* of these babies, and even the Flagship can't hope to defeat you.

**Your starting crew having a bit of job experience.** Other members that join your ship could also have a bit of experience, and an expensive mercenary might have lots.

**More control over what your boarders do.** It would be great to prioritise attacking a system over attacking the people. Sometimes I want to just get in there and sabotage that annoying drone control and then teleport out ASAP. It would also be great if your boarders could attempt to loot the ship

**Assigning duties to your crew.** Right now they always prioritise attacking boarders, repairing system and then using the system. It would be great to re-organise that list, so for example you could have two crew in a room, one assigned to always use the system, and one attacking that boarder in the room. I don't want my engi fighting alongside my mantis and totally ignoring repairing the shields the ship so desperately needs!

**Using broken systems without repairing.** Linking to the above

**Setting up patrols.** When I have more crew than systems, and upon seeing a problem attempting to fix it. As well as that, being able to assign crew to automatically go to a system to fix it, as long as your sensors are up and running.

The higher the efficiency number

For anyone that's unfamiliar with how the math of evasion works: each point of dodge percentage you gain is better than the last.  Let's take your ship with its 30 hull and fire enough Leto missiles at it to kill it - this will take 30 missiles if you're at 0% dodge, but it increases the average number of missiles needed to kill you from 1500 to 3000 (an increase of 100%).

This means that going from 51%-&gt;55% dodge is actually a bigger increase than going from 15%-&gt;20% even though it's a 4% flat gain instead of 5%.  However

**TL;DR:** Engines are very important and cost effective up to Level 5; higher levels aren't worthless,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,t3_1itwoz

While I was playing today as the Engi, to the Engine Room. I immagined this to be the lowest point on the ship, with the most danger, the dirtiest work, highest stress, etc. Being on an Engi vessel the Human was designated this low spot, and was referred to only as his station title of ""Engineering.""

What captured me about him was his determination. I know it was because of my control, so he always had a very difficult time. I mean, he would have to patch breaches, put out fires, repair rooms, run the engines, and basically keep the entire ship functional while not even being acknowledged by his robot-like Engi crew mates.

One particular scene that still tickles me was when the ship was struck by a missile in the Engine Room. I pictured the Engi crew standing up after the ship is rocked by a massive explosion. They look at each other

""Breach - Engine Room."" says the first gray alien

""Engineering? Status

""Life signs: Stable.""

""Assist?""

""Negative.""

And the two gray analytical aliens go about their usual tasks of continuing the attack without even thinking about Engineering

Meanwhile in the Engine Room

He ended up dying in an attack after a laser tore through an already burning Engine Room. Of course I continued playing; the Engi were the ones on the mission in this run

FEDERATION PRIME

Sources within the Federation Ministry of War have confirmed an increasing number of complaints coming from recent Mantis defectors to Federation forces. Said protests claim that newly-assigned Mantis officers are being appointed chiefly to security functions and denied access to technical positions

Ensign Kara,"" she says, teary-eyed. ""My father was a starship engineer. I know starship engines inside out. But I've been in this ship for almost a standard year and all I've done is ship security and boarding. What's the use of all my knowledge if they just want me as a killing machine? It's not fair.""

Lt. Perry of the FSS Minanta is also distressed. ""When I was first assigned here, and I was reassigned to security. No questions asked. Report to the teleporter. Hunt. Kill. Show no mercy. That was it,"" he relates.

Roxanne Smith of the Species Equality Advisory Group, subsection iii states that '...all officers aboard Federation starships are entitled to protection from discrimination regarding their planet of origin.' What they conveniently forgot, though, was to specify penalties for commanding officers who disregard these guidelines, and so they basically have free rein to do as they please, which means Human pilots, Engi engine techs, and, and embarrassing to us as a governing body. It goes against everything the Federation stands for.""

Commander Matthieu of the Kalastor, you have to take care of them with the best troops you have. And those are the Mantis,"" he praises. ""Besides, they're terrible at repair. Have you ever seen a Mantis try to use a hydrospanner? It's painful to watch. And if you want to be a tech officer, you need to be able to make quick repairs with the tools at hand. Not even the Rockmen are as slow as the Mantis with repair. When the shields are down and the engines are crippled, you need to get the ship up and running ASAP or the enemy is going to turn it into Swiss cheese. It's that simple.""

Smith, Engi, and Zoltans given better riot gear to deal with invading troops? Because the Ministry wants to scrimp every last credit in this war at the expense of ethical values. And if we've turned into bigots because of this war, then the Rebels have already won.""

The Ministry of War has issued an official statement assuring citizens that ""The Federation Fleet is, and that the Mantis complaints are being reviewed and will be addressed in due course."" They also state that ""However, (...) commanders, as per the regulations, as the supreme officers of their vessels, have final word on all operational matters, including, assignment of officer duties.""",t5_2tnu1,True

I think this game really would benefit from having as many ship systems manable as possible.  Oftentimes I have 2-3 extra crewmembers and no teleporter to use them and they feel like dead weight on a ship where nobody should be waiting around.

Examples:

**Cloaking:** when manned reduce cooldown time between cloaks. Could also have a skill associated with it.

**Drones:** the one I want the most. Would increase drone damage

**Doors:** when manned increase time it takes for intruders to break through doors. Could just be binary (bounus vs. no bonus) when it comes to skills as having a ""doors"" skill for each crewmember seems a little silly to me.

**Teleporter:** would decrease the recharge time on the teleporter (but this would require a bigger room for the teleporter so the operator could stand off of the pad)

**Sensors:** I'm out of ideas for what this one could do

**O2:** ???

Now you would probably rarely use the option to man these unless you have extra crew and that's just fine. I just want the game set up so if you send a crewmember to repair, that you're always losing some functionality. Plus more options to place people would only lead to more interesting solutions to fights.

So

*30 seconds.* 

He looked to his right to his fellow Port Corp member Zzaz. He could see ZZaz’s eyes already turning from a subtle blue hue to a deep red ember. Something he was sure was the stuff of nightmares for most spacenaughts was now an oddly reassuring sight for him.  He had seen the two red dots time and time again move swiftly and silently in a darkened weapons or shield room slashing Rockmen and Engi and even those of his own race time and time again. 

There is a saying in the Federation that goes:

A spacenaught is dangerous job for fools and the Port Corps is a suicide mission for the insane. 

Being a spacenaught was already a dangerous enough thing flying in the empty vastness of space fighting in little more than weaponized coffins. But being a Port Corps member meant jumping into an enemy ship outnumbered sometimes in nebula storms bring chaos on enemy crew before porting back sometimes right as the enemy ship is literally coming apart. In the Federation it was a capital offense to wear the patch of the Port Corps unless you were a spacejumper and you don’t not get your patch until you survive your first space jump. In actual combat. 

*20 seconds.*

There is nothing like it in the universe. The feeling that you get in your stomach as your particles are hurled into space is something you never get used to. In the academy by the time you get enlisted on to a ship as a Port Corps private it was not unheard of to have over ten thousands space jumps on record. There was something truly unifying about it. The Mantis have a word for it in their own tongue. It roughly translates as “In the space between time.” The sensation in that nano perhaps femto second after you vanish from your own ship and before you materialize on some poor slug helmsman was both chaotic and serene. 

First all your outer extremities go. Non vital organs first. Logical enough. In the astronomically low chance an enemy missile hits the teleport room right as you are space jumping it is better that your head and torso are not the first parts to arrive conveniently ready to be tortured by the enemy for information. Nestool had heard horror stories from when the technology was first used for space combat. Luckily

*10 seconds.*

And then. CARNAGE. Most engagements last less than 3 minutes. His first space jump into actual combat lasted less than a minute. The fatality rate among privates in the Port Corps for the first jump is somewhere around 50 percent. Half of all Port Corps members don’t make the port back their first jump into chaos which is the reason why you get your patch only after your first jump. Port Corps members are a superstitious bunch. Zzaz wore hers on her left maw. Nestool wondered how many times he had seen that maw tear into the head Zoltan before it fissured into nothing? He had never seen it in the teleport room being always in the bravo position.

*5 seconds.*

But this time he was in the alpha position due to the room schematic of the Engi ship and the needed positioning upon materialization. This was the last chance The Kestrel had to survive and everything about this boarding had to go right. They had one missile left. A fire bomb. The engi ship was heavily shielded and the Kestrel had taken heavy damage. It could take one salvo max from the full deployment of the enemy ship and then who knows which components would be damaged from that first salvo. Weapons and the telepad must not be hit. For the plan to work they would need some luck. They would telly into the cockpit and take on whoever was inside. 15 seconds later his two fellow Rockmen Port Corps brothers would telly into their weapons room. As soon as the injuried crewmen fled to the medipad room the fire bomb would blast it on fire and the Rockmen would rush as fast a Rockmen could into the medipad room. 

His muscles tensed up one final time before the jump. How many of them would survive this jump? He thought of his two Rockmen brothers Samson and Goliath waiting stoically in the next room. How many of the crew would survive the first salvo? He thought of his lover Charlie piloting the ship. 

*Teleport in progress.*

And then nothingness. The nothingness that always came but this time enveloped him slower than before. First his outer limbs then his torso and finally his head. His last sight before he was flung into the space between time was a pair dark red ember eyes glowing brightly in a void.

- I think it'd be cool to be able to buy your way out of certain battles through bribery, missiles, etc to end the fighting as an alternative to waiting for your FTL to charge. Not a big thing, but it'd be nice (especially in situations when your engine goes down or it looks like surefire doom).
- I'd like a modular way to mess with how quickly the fleet advances, but also to have slower, normal, then quicker advancement. Then maybe also progressive and/or dice-rolled speed variables (progressive = starts with no advancement, ends up on quicker advancement by the final 1 - 2 sectors // dice-roll being that it'd roll a dice to pick a pace per each sector you go into). What you choose could affect the rate of your score (or, in some cases, disallow you from placing on high scores)
- I'd love more ways to get upgrades and augmentations. Sometimes this happens with weapons/drones, maybe you can get the drone upgrade that way, in lieu of grabbing scrap and buying it. This would probably unbalance gameplay toward boarding strategies though, and like I said, it does happen with weapons, but I'd like to see upgrades, even if it seldom happened.
- There should be another upgrade that allows you travel quicker; sometimes the one that lets you go backwards ends up being useless - I'd like something that let you travel to systems 2 points away from you
- It'd be nice to be able to extend the lifeline of your Hull; health upgrades (maybe it'd take an augmentation slot or something) It'd also be nice to
- CREATE-A-SHIP/LAYOUT
- This is a little out there and more of a roleplay thing
- - Abandon your own ship and steal another's if you wanted to (which could lead to, or opponents fighting you with two smaller ships instead of always just with one)
- - Some sort of hacking ability, etc. but obviously you could play to that if you had 4 shields, and maybe if you upgraded your hacking and put more power toward it, it would take less from you and more from your opponent -- they could always focus fire your hacking interface :p)
- - A way to play more stealthily/be undetected if you wanted to; steal cargo, progress through the game on pure evasion/cloak, boarding with stealth parties and stealing

Have you always wanted to attack the other ships asking for fuel? Now you can! What about fighting stations? You can do that too. Rebel ships seem too easy when they claimed the beacon? Now cruisers can spawn!

These are just a few of the features that this mod brings to the game, or were just unbalanced.

Been playing FTL for a while - love it. But my personal wish is for a hotkey based crew system.

The idea would be to create a crew position key primarily. So CTRL/SHIFT+1 would send all crew to their designated positions. 

I am am constantly pulling my crew out of position. Especially after fights to heal up. Having a one press solution to positioning would really speed up things and ensure I have the right crew member in place (although that is rare). 

Another hotkey crew press would be good for grabbing a Engi or designated repairman to move them. 

I know this is a very minor detail but I don't think it would break the game in terms of balance just make things slightly quicker. 

Thoughts?

I'll start by listing some links and my own findings.

* [ftldat](https://github.com/bwesterb/ftldat)
* [thread](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1920) about above tool on the official forums

* A lot *seems* to be moddable due to a fairly flexible xml -system
* Many things in there could be overwritten by hardcode

It seems the following have been tested:

* **Disabling the rebel pursuit is simple**. Instructions and necessary file: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zyzl1/modder_has_figured_out_how_to_disable_fleet/c6911ii)
* All character names seem to be drawn from a single ""human"" list
* Ship statistics
* Adding and moving rooms of a ship is possible
* The room layout (shipname.txt) file syntax is like [this](http://pastebin.com/8nprzHH6)
* Graphics elements can be changed

My own findings:

* ~~First sector seems to be hard coded
* Changing and adding different kinds of sectors works

~~I'll try to work in custom events next.~~

Currently working on custom events:

* [BLERP sector](http://imgur.com/a/3Q9Ra) now has a custom startup event
* Added [a couple of events](http://imgur.com/a/wwikc) into the sector. One of them seems to have some issues.

By sector five we were still running almost entirely on those starting lasers, killing both of our Mantises. Their brief funeral was shadowed by the threat of imminent demise for all, the ship now lacking any real offensive options. 

After a sector of running from tough enemies a chance shop brought some hope back, depriving ships of their shields and carving them up like roasts. So too did stage one of the boss, where careful planning even led to the elimination of several non-weapons crewmembers on their ship via application of SMAG and breach bombs. 

Stage two, and only carefully timed cloaking kept the rest of the crew alive long enough to put out the fires. Things were looking grim, but we pressed on. After a hop to the nearest repair station, we took our last shot at the boss. 

Both ships went into the fight crippled and missing half their crews. We lost our replacement shield-operator to a boarding party, the crew threw down their last ounces of strength to tear through the enemy's hull for good, knowing that they themselves were doomed to die from asphyxiation soon enough. And so ended the tale of the USS Redshirt, first to successfully brave the terrors of normal difficulty and come out ever-so-slightly victorious.",,False,,False,t3_10ltt8

Update 3: Disregard Update 2. There is still something wrong

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**   
Update 2: I've found out why the game crashes

* Open the created blueprint.xml.append in notepad
* Find the &lt;crew count=""x"" class=""y""&gt; element
* Change it to &lt;crew **amount=**""x"" class=""y""&gt;
* Find the &lt;weaponList count=""x"" missile=""y""&gt;
* Change it to &lt;weaponList count=""x"" missile**s**=""y""&gt;
* Save
* load with GMM

Update 1:
I've added the remove rooms/doors features

While the Door system now produces some graphic artifacts

Hi

I need some people testing my Ship creator. The game crashes when i use the created files and i don't know why.
Explosion animation, too.

It is written in C# so it needs the .NET framework or mono to run. For people running linux /OS X: It works with mono for windows

How to use

1. Load a ship Image

2. Position ship and shield with the buttons/text fields in the top right corner.
Align your layout with the grid. You can turn the grid and a Screenshot on/off with the last two buttons in the menu to help you find the right position.

3. Add as many rooms as you like to your ship by selecting the 8th button. Click

4. Connect your rooms with doors by selecting the 9th button. Door placement should be intuitive now. Just move the mouse where you want the door to be placed an left click to put down. Doors can now be removed with the 11th button.

5. Assign Systems to your rooms with the 13th-23th Button. Just select a System and click on a room. Only one System per room and only one of each system per ship.

6. Select the Weapon mount position by selecting the 12th button. Select which orientation you want for that mount. Click on the map to draw a mount

7. Edit the systems in the ""Systems"" tab on the bottom left. The number in the box is the power that system starts with when you start or buy it. Check the checkboxes to select whether or not your ship should start with it.

8. Click the Weapon/Drone boxes in the bottom left to select the starting weapons/drones. Click ""Custom"" if you know the ""name="" of a custom weapon.

9. Customize your crew in the ""Crew"" tab in the upper right tab.

10. Edit the Ship name etc. in the ""Ship"" tab on the bottom left.

11. Click the 2nd button to save the ship to a folder. Existing files will be overwritten. The tool will create subfolders. To create a .ftl mod file for GMM

Please consider that this is the first piece of software I ever released, so excuse that ,too.

Change log

Suddenly a Mantis ship was on us like plasma sticks to a warp core. My FTL drive was charging like old people fuck and our shields were getting pounded. My crew rushed to try to put out the flames as solar flares devastated our door control and O2. Pulse after Pulse fired from our cannons as we burned from the inside.
The Enemy had no regard to their own safety and suffered for it. They focused on repairing their guns instead of their shields. The mistake cost them their lives as the next wave of solar matter atomized them.
My crew rushed to the forward bulkhead as I opened every door I could to space.
The Fires were out but we had to Jump or be burned alive.
We limped to the next point blind as suffocation was taking hold. Scanners were useless due to the nebula. The crew rushed the o2 room with a slim hope of fixing it before choking out when out of no-ware we hear a message over the coms... Prepare to be boarded.

Two brave engineers held their breath long enough to get the life support operating again but would not live to enjoy their efforts. My two Mantis Mercs got to fighting the intruders while I tried to get the engines fully repaired so we could run for our lives again.

Most of you have noticed that the starter ship, the most valuable ship, carries over 300 scrap's worth more, almost all in drones and drone parts.

Other things I learned doing this:

* The ships that are drone- or missile-reliant

* The Kestrel and Federation ships are the only ones without augments.

* You start with 30 scrap on Easy and 10 on normal.

* Compared to the average (median) ship

I was building up a strong, a human pilot and my 3 Zoltan men. I was cruising through sectors, and even when I took dangerous hull damage, a store was in jump-range and I had a bounty of scrap.

Then I fucked up, their quad-lasers ate through my shields and took out my guns, their triple shield was too much for my usual Leto to shields, laser to guns and shields, leto to shields and finishing Halberd to deal with- I went from strong armor and a confident future to 5 hull and incoming missiles, luckily- with no missiles and 1 fuel for the jump, I made it through the sector beacon- Yes, but if I can find a store

I was instantly intercepted by pirates. Their shields were powerful, fixing the system before the enemy lasers came in, they had a heavy laser, dual laser and a beam, dangerous, right? Would have torn me apart in a few hits on a normal occasion.

After a minute of taking in hits, so they would lower my shields only to have them recover before the beam would charge.

This lead to a stalemate that potentially would last forever- they wouldn't jump away

[The situation](http://i.imgur.com/a2lxz.jpg)

After awhile all my system workers were on gold level, I was hoping this would help me do more damage, or anything that would help me win. unfortunately, my attempts were in vain, the eternal struggle was starting to make the crew, and me, exhausted, and agreed to make this ship our mutual graves.

Pause, open all airlocks, disable weapons, say your last words. 

[Unpause.](http://i.imgur.com/Sr8Nb.jpg)

Instantly they barraged the unshielded ship

""Full power to the main gun!"" I shout. ""Target all weapons on med bay and weapons bay; Mantii

My crew members follow my instructions perfectly. The mantii rip them apart except for the last two rebels trying desperately to put out the fire spreading for the med bay. The rebels succeed and reroute some of the power to the weapons bay and manage to teleport a bomb onto our own teleporter.

""Get off the helm and off the engines! Fix that so we can bring these boys home! Cut off the weapons; let the artillery do it's work.""

I look on my display. The main gun is at 90%. This is gonna be close.

The enemy has decided to focus on the Mantii. My boarding crew is getting desperately close to death in this prolonged battle.

The display flashes

""The teleporter is fixed

Perfect. Just in the nick of time.

The AI comes on

""Activate teleport!"" I'm shouting

""Artillery beam at 99%!"" chimes in the AI as my misplaced crew get caught in the teleport and are beamed aboard the doomed enemy ship.

""Primary weapon at full power.""

The repairmen don't have time to think. They finish their teleport and pull out their weapons.

You can feel my ship heat up as the plasma surges through the artillery cannon's mechanical veins.

The repairmen only get off one shot each

""Primary weapon: powered down"" flashes the screen in front of me.

I quickly beam my crew back on board the ship.

""You're a real asshole sometimes

""Nonsense- we had it the whole time. Wasn't even close!"" I say triumphantly. The crew watches through the window as the rebel ship explodes from an uncontained fire.

""Sure.""

I enter a new sector and a station is under attack, I send two waves, leaving no crew members on board (my ship was on fire and broken so I wanted to kill their crew as fast as possible). Naturally, however, I forgot to turn off my weapons. I destroy the ship. I think that I have lost as all my crewmembers went down with the enemy ship.

However, and the thankful station opens up a shop for me. What's more, they have crew members available. So, apparently with the autopilot shopping, I sell a bomb weapon and hire a Slug. He starts to repair the oxygen so that I can make my ship semihabitable again (many parts are still on fire, several breaches exist, and the med-chamber doesn't have oxygen and is broken so I can't fix it without my slug dying). The brave slug fixes the oxygen and right before he dies from asphyxiation I open the shop quickly, without questioning how this particular slug might feel about going on a ship with only a single dying crew member on it.

1364363320.0,1b3h04,Just got my hardest-fought victory on Normal (Spoilers),fedora718,48,5,13,"I really wish I had been recording the whole thing. It was an inspiring story.  Here goes.

The Red Tail launched with Captain Atreyu, and Marine Junpeng.  Our heros were lucky enough to acquire a Crew Transporter early on, resulting in a great deal of successful boarding actions.  Around halfway to the Federation base, however, they began to get concerned: their weapons loadout had not changed in days.  Atreyu assured his crew they would find something to help them defeat the rebel flagship they knew was persuing them.  Sectors passed, and while the ship gained remarkable defenses, it's offensive capabilities were used primarily to keep enemies weapon's disabled so that Junpeng's marines could capture other ships.

It was around the 6th sector that a prodigy came aboard.  His name was Mattieu and he was a rockman with an unquenchable appetite for violence.  Naturally, nothing could escape their grasp.

During this time of plenty

In the final sector before the Federation base, do a small amount of damage, and immediately beam back so that they did not suffocate.  Just as the duo wrecked the ship's primary weapon, a Burst Laser Mk III, Junpeng's Oxygen indicator beeped, signalling it was time to come home.  

""Two to beam back

""Alright I've got a lock and... wait! no I've lost you!"" came the response.  To the boarding party's horror they saw the telltale blue glow of a cloaked ship around them.  Knowing he had only seconds left to live

""Make me proud.""

Mattieu flew into a rage watching his mentor die. two more weapons were crushed under his rocky fists before Atreyu could pull him back.  It did not take long to finish off the automaton

In the aftermath

""He taught me everything I know about being a marine."" The rock rumbled.  ""How can we hope to defeat the rebels without him?""

""Our mission hasn't changed

""Who will lead the away missions? You know that our weapons are insufficient.""

""You will.  There are two slugmen on the engineering crew. Choose one as your squadmate and bring him up to speed.""

The rest of the journey was the same as before.  Ships were captured, no weapons presented themselves. The Red Tail jumped into the Federation sector at last, Ill prepared for the battle ahead.  Upon their arrival, Admiral Tully greeted them with some surprise, and immediately set them to the task of destroying the rebel flagship.  There were a number of minor upgrades the crew could apply, but nothing to improve the weapons.  They jumped towards their foe with heavy hearts.

The battle was long and hard.  Mattieu and Paul, but only a lucky fourth laser shot could hope to do any real damage.  Again, the task of disabling the ship fell to the Boarding Crew.

Teleporting onto the bridge was a useful tactic. It distracted the helmsman enough that Varnas could launch occasional salvos, Mattieu and Paul could teleport into the shield room just after Varnas hit it with a laser and prevent repairs from being carried out long enough for another shot or two to damage the generators further.  This was not without danger though, a few times Mattieu or Paul found themselves too close to a rupturing plasma conduit.  Eventually, Paul fell to an unlucky combination of stealth, defensive marines, and a stray shot from Varnas.

After an hour of Guerilla boarding actions with the remaining Slugman

""Sir

""That's true, and come back with her drones.  We can't do that!""

""If I can get her crew in that wing

A moment passed as Atreyu considered it.

""Do it.""

The next boarding action went straight to the Cloaking device.  Just as Matt predicted

""Captain! now!""

The Rock and Slug teleported back to their ship just as four superheated bolts of energy ripped into the port wing of the ship. It gave one last groan and ripped away

The Red tail crew celebrated briefly as they patched up the damage they'd taken in the fight.  In a few minutes

As soon as they jumped into range of the ship, it was time For Mattieu and his protoge to take the fight to the enemy.  They made short work of the flagship's primary weapons. and for hours they teleported around the ship, disrupting repairs and systems until the starboard wing began to show signs of stress just like the port one did.  Eventually it was ready to break off, just like the last one.

The Rebels has learned from the first encounter though

The Red Tail crew patched themselves up again and steeled themselves for a final confrontation.  The flagship was crippled

As soon as the ship jumped into weapons range

""Matt! Repel boarders!"" he yelled into the Intercom.  The proximity alarm sounded from the main ship interface as missiles and laser blasts sped towards the Red Tail.  Atreyu managed to dodge some of them

""Oh no..."" he muttered.  Green bolts flew out from the rebel ship

At the stern of the ship

""You cannot kill me, even if they weren't being healed.  He began to hear loud banging noises from the airlock door.

""Stupid rebels! teleporting into a vented airlock!  I hope you like the taste of space!"" Matt laughed.

Suddenly alarms sounded and the room exploded.  The holo docs disappeared

Back on the bridge, Sick bay, and Shields were all offline.  There were three hull breaches, and most of his crew were on death's door.  This could be the end of their journey.  One system, however was not damaged beyond use: The FTL drive.

""I swore I'd never run from these dogs...""

He called up the star chart and jumped away

The Red Tail appeared a few light years away, kicked out the gaping airlock, just before it automatically sealed itself.  Matt collapsed to the floor ad the rest of the crew, minus the captain, rushed past him to repair life support.  after a moment he got to work fixing the holo docs so it could patch him up.

Eventually, and he became BFFs with the Federation human. 

Then, and oxygen-less emptiness filled the ship. The undamaged drone control station managed to destroy the enemy ship with the level 2 attack drone, but the ship itself was in trouble. All the crew worked frantically to repair it, but the oxygen, med bay station and other rooms were severely damaged with several holes in the hull. Soon, all the oxygen in the ship was gone as the crew died one by one. First, the hired help. Then, leaving the Federation human alone without oxygen in the med bay.

In the coldness of space, running from the med bay to the life support station, then back before he asphyxiated. But he couldn't do it. The Engi might have been able to, but...

Then, but now could be switched in. It worked with the Federation human to fix the ship, then he set out, alone, determined to make it as far as he could.

It surely seemed hopeless, unwilling to surrender. He, also like the Engi, found other crewmen to bring aboard the ship. He upgraded it beyond what the Engi had been able to do. Two heavy lasers, a level two attack drone, a level one attack drone, and a Pegasus missile launcher. The Federation human arrived with his 3 crew to warn the Federation.

But we all know the Federation is a bit of a jerk. ""Oh, thanks.

1349268622.0,10vefd,[MOD TOOL] FTL Ship Creator 0.2 BETA - MAJOR UPDATE! It works now.,Neshgaddal,48,9,34,"Update: There were a lot of reports about crashes on start. I've uploaded a new version that *might* solve that problem. Some other minor bugs have been fixed

Hi everyone

My Ship Creator works now. I've added some new features, Augments and many little things.It's now also build for .NET 4.0/mono, so it should work on windows XP with .NET 4.0 and linux/OS X with mono now. I've updated the instructions below.
 
[screenshot](http://imgur.com/ECusJ)

It is written in C# so it needs the .NET framework or mono to run. For people running linux /OS X: It works with mono for windows

WARNING. This version seems to be especially buggy. Multiple users reported crashes or just not starting. I'll look in to it and post an updated version soon. Thanks everyone for testing.

**Newest version:**    
[DOWNLOAD v0.2 BETA](http://www.mediafire.com/?a155tiuwqe1pdap)


**Old versions**   
[DOWNLOAD v0.2 BETA](http://www.mediafire.com/?d739dg9afwc9q79)
[DOWNLOAD v0.1.1 BETA](http://www.mediafire.com/?gjnqk99fk0q1xwg)

[DOWNLOAD v0.1.0 BETA](http://www.mediafire.com/?6zsi80bgzqez5di)


**Installation:**
You have to have  [.NET Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851) or [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) installed.

 



Having ftldat installed is very much recommended. You can download it [here](http://westerbaan.name/~bas/ftldat/ftldat-latest.exe) -Thanks bas for this great tool.

On the first start


**How to use**

1. Load an ship existing ship with file&gt; load &gt; load Player Ship &gt; name. You can change the image

2. Position ship and shield with the buttons/text fields in the top right corner. Align your layout with the grid. You can turn the grid and comparison kestrel on/off with the last two buttons in the menu to help you find the right position. Loaded ships and layouts are already in the right position.

3. Add or remove as many rooms as you like to your ship by selecting the 8th and button. Click

4. Connect your rooms with doors or delete them with the 9th and 11th button. Door placement should be intuitive now. Just move the mouse where you want the door to be placed an left click to put down.

5. Assign Systems to your rooms with the 14th-24th Button. Just select a System and click on a room. Only one of each system per ship 

6. Select the Weapon mount position by selecting the 12th button. Select which orientation you want for that mount. Click on the map to draw a mount

7. Edit the systems in the ""Systems"" tab on the bottom left. The number in the box is the power that system starts with when you start or buy it. Check the checkboxes to select whether or not your ship should start with it.


8. Click the Weapon/Drone boxes in the bottom left to select the starting weapons/drones. Click ""Custom"" if you know the ""name="" of a custom weapon.

9. Customize your crew in the ""Crew"" tab in the upper right tab. You can also add and remove Augments in the ""Augments"" tab

10. Edit the Ship name etc. in the ""Ship"" tab on the bottom left.

11. Click the 2nd button to save the ship to a folder. Existing files will be overwritten. The tool will create subfolders. To create a .ftl mod file for GMM

The sudden quiet hum of the energy systems on board was a shock after the absolute mayhem of just a few moments before.  One final swipe of the Pike Beam from our port weapon bay had sliced through the hull of the Rebel Mothership, floated aimless outside of the ship, a [small cloud strewn about us](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067977968/C6069FEC381372448E8E51C9C3B2B08CB11E7355/).  In the distance, you could see the larger battleships of the Rebel fleet, engaged in their own manouvers--but it was only a matter of time until they became aware of us and the damage done to them.

""Hull report?""

""Analysis shows slight damage.  No major damages.  No loss of hull integrity.""  Markus' voice was analytical, but they certainly knew how to make this ship fly a lot better than our own Zoltan.  Far more precise.

I quickly pulled up a [full systems report](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067980609/69CD43F4E7D4DA436BB213A8B4AA1888890780F0/) from the weapons bay, I'd gladly moved back to the targeting console near the forward nose of the vessel.

Everything looked well stocked and outfitted.  I did one [final check of our weapons and drone systems](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067982164/EE8FB51FE88A0254B4664F3E516146C334D78408/), and often our savior.

""Caldwell here.  Engines are powered and we are ready for FTL.""

I turned away from the console and eyed those ships out in the darkness for another moment.  ""Markus

""FTL engaging.  Stand by.""  That slight visual wrenching feeling as the drive engaged, and had a few repair drones swarming over us as they beamed necessary fuel, drone parts, and missile pods on board.  Within about 20 minutes, we were patched up and ready to go.

I gathered the crew in the shield bay.  The three Zoltan, large and hulking, slowly flexing his large fists.  The quiet Engi, Markus.  And the Mantis siblings, the finest warriors I'd ever seen, sharing a quiet if tense joke with each other.

""We one last jump to make.  No matter what happens, I couldn't help but grin.  But you could still feel a tension--we might not make this one.

Again, powerful, but limping; both the port and starboard wings had been blown off by our previous efforts.  I gasped as I got a good look on our readout--the damn thing had a Zoltan shield!  This would not make things easy.

""Markus, and drones.  Mantis twins, we already wiped out their crew thanks to your hard work--but their automated AI looks to have repaired the weapons systems.  As soon as their overshield is down, you know what to do.""  Quickly, I tapped in the targeting systems and [engaged the ion blasters and pike beam to get through that overshield as fast a possible](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067984338/B56FA11085AB8218C9F679ED3EFFDF2B821F08E0/).  They may have been using our tech, but we knew it best.  The drones could be seen as they launched out of the ship, moving in an elliptical orbit

Menacing, missiles and energy beams  harmlessly impacting against the energy barrier.   The ion blasters and pike beam did their work, my hands quickly routing recharging power from the system back into them to get them firing faster.  Before long, their overshield was down--but so was ours from a second volley.

""Teleport NOW!""  The radio coms came back as the Mantis twins jumped over, a warning klaxon going off.

""Minor damages Captain, and you could see exposed portions of the hull crackling from the damage.

Suddenly, NOW!""  Just in time, the view outside became slightly smoky as our ship vanished from view, and the Engi pilot executed an immediate roll, [dodging the huge volley of laser fire that had threatened to tear through the shields and cause major damage](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560964212067992234/0C00BF83C7CF3A1CA8573039BDA049CA77AE7EC9/).

Gritting my teeth, we continued to pelt them.  Fortunately, we had done so much damage to their systems by this point that they were just a sitting duck.

With a final cry of victory, peace had found us.  At last, we could claim freedom for all.

At last

**Begging/Pirating**
Faster Than Light is a game developed by an indie team - not a studio. The game is retailing for $9.99 (or other reasonable amount in your local currency). That's very affordable for the amount of content you receive for your *purchase.* For these two very good reasons

Save up your allowance, go mow someone's yard, gather up cans and recycle them, go play your musical insturment of choice in public with a hat, ask your friends to donate $1 to your space exploration fund or go make some trades on /r/gameswap.

**Promoting /r/ftlgame**
/r/ftlgame was established to help share Faster Than Light with Reddit by a fan (me) and not by the developers. With that said

If you see FTL being discussed out there in /r/gaming, etc - if you could, throw a /r/ftlgame link out there because /r/ftl is private but kind enough to re-direct to us, but it always helps to have a clear map.

Over the past few weeks I've been seeing a lot of questions about beginner advice.  The following is a list of my most important tips (and they are closely related).  Also

1.  Upgrade your engines over shields.  I usually get them to level 4 or 5 (fully powered) before I upgrade shields to level 2.  

2.  Always have piloting AND engines manned and level them quickly.  The combined +10% evasion is amazing

3.  Don't level your reactor until you need the power for your engines, and then switch the power back when the enemy fires.

**TL;DR Make sure your evasion is as high as possible before upgrading other systems.**

EDIT:  There have been a lot of responses about dealing with beams, experiences in the first few sectors, etc.  It is meant to be a general rule of thumb that I have found to reduce my overall damage over a single FTL playthrough.  By all means, spend 20 extra scrap if you need Lvl 2 doors because you have weak crew that will be unable to handle a boarding party.  But these are minor details; having high evasion early on instead of shields is the single most important factor ON AVERAGE for reducing total damage.",,False,,1358310930.0,t3_16nigo

With that being said I think that this game can also use a few changes that could really help make it shine
****************************************************

**Endless Mode**

I've seen this mentioned a few times in this subreddit

**Sector Bosses**

The way I think this would work best is to have some sort of mini-boss at every exit beacon and have the battles with a few constraints.  Time limit

**More Weapons/Equipment/System Options**

I thought of this because what game wouldn't thrive on more options?  Yet, perhaps specialized equipment that aid the stealth/teleporter cooldown comes right to mind.  Maybe for new system/subsystems we could have a . . . um . . . shit.  Again I'm all for ideas on this one, I thought something like this was pretty self-explanatory for add-ons anyways.

**More Random Events**

Who doesn't love more random events?

**Build-Your-Own-Ship Mode**

Ok, and then you buy systems/subsystems/weapons/equipment for your ship.  So, for instance, take the Kestrel and you just add whatever you like as far as everything goes.  Burst Laser Mk II? Check.  Crystal Vengeance? Check. Zoltan Shield?  Well . . . there would obviously be a balancing act that would require some time but, why wouldn't you want to try and supercharge your ship?  Coupled with the endless mode?  [Well then.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYj7T9eEQ4U)  One caveat that I think is necessary, there would have to be 4 required systems/subsystems, and they are Engine, Oxygen

1348913005.0,10nv4l,Curse you random number god! Some tips to shift luck into your favor.,Uler,47,9,19,"I've seen a fair few complaints about the game being too random

* When going through zones, often multiple of them, very often it's possible to see every (or nearly every) node in a zone to ensure you see these shops. Not only can you find shops this way, but also distress beacons which are often worth more than other nodes. Ensuring you use every jump you can before the exit is blocked is important, but so is improving your odds of seeing what you want to.

* Don't go to stores if you don't have meaningful amounts of scrap. Sure, just go to other nodes. Possibly move around in a circle if you can to see if you have some scrap on your way past.

* As part of the above tip, however, as while passing opportunities can cause you pain down the line, falling behind the curve can get you outright killed. Just keep in mind that the most expensive item in this game is cloak/shield at 150, and the second most is Pre-Igniter at 120.

* Scrap spent on repairs is scrap spent not making your ship better! Always be mindful that any point of damage you take is scrap spent repairing. In addition to that however

* Crew killing isn't just for boarders! Consider spending a little scrap on sensors 2. You'll find that even without boarders there's a fair few cases where you can kill the enemy crew even with plain conventional lasers. Ships manned by 2 or 3 people can often be cleaned out before the ship goes down. Sensor 2 also has a few favorable events that can let it pay for itself anyways.

* Hitting the helm and engines can be even better than shields. Sure

* Don't use excessive force, do so. Sure, a two shield target and you only have a single burst laser 2 may take awhile, but if you keep missiles and drones for when you need them they should always be available. You can use that missile if they try to FTL or some such, but otherwise reserve it for when it will help mitigate damage.

* Don't always cloak for the enemy volley just because it fired. This applies primarily to laser volleys. If you have say 3 shield against 5 shot barrage. If you manage to dodge 2 naturally then there's no need for the cloak. Keep an eye on the shield and pause frequently if you wish, because screw those.

Hopefully some of these will help some of you make your runs a little bit more consistent. I imagine these are obvious to some,False,,t5_2tnu1,1348913296.0,,ftlgame-flairMANTIS,t3_10nv4l

1347738565.0,zxsxs,I added hotkey functionality to the game!,,43,9,21,"hu[Good news everyone!](http://i.imgur.com/ii0up.jpg) 

I added some basic hotkey functionality to the game!  I made it so you can get to the ship page, select your crew, and disable your weapons, all from the comfort of the keyboard! I mainly created this because I use a laptop and I don't like having to use the touchpad.


Now, and the script moves your mouse over and clicks on them manually. It really works best if you use windowed mode. Also, you can throw it off if you move the mouse while it's clicking something for you. The total click operation takes about 1/5 of a second, so it's not too much of an issue. 

Here's how it works. If you have AutoHotkey installed, and everything else should work fine. It's really easy.

**Key commands**

* Shift + Weapon Keys (1-7) will disarm / shutdown the weapon or drone
* qwe / asd / zx will select individual crew members
* f / g will fire the open/close all doors actions
* tab will open the jump menu
* ` (above the tab button) will open the Ship menu

**Downloads**

* You can find the source and executable here: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=53AC9E9657ECC288!188

**TL;DR:** I added basic hotkey support. It's not perfect

**Please let me know if you want me to add any functionality or have any questions!**",,t5_2tnu1,1347740479.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zxsxs/i_added_hotkey_functionality_to_the_game/

Commanded by a fearless crew of three, the Kruiser faced terrors previously unknown. An alien mantis that teleported onto the ship? Gunned down by Debbie in the weapons room. Pirates attacking stranded civilians? Day saved. 

Until we jumped too close to a sun. The warp beacon, oblivious to the danger everyone was in, attacked at will. We traded missiles and lasers against a fiery sun. A solar flare hit and a fire started in the cockpit. No problem. Flip is great at putting out fires. Well, he was. Flip was a good man, no doubt. Why he didn't flee the cockpit in time is unclear. He fought to the bitter end, God bless him. 

The fire spread to the hallway. Debbie and Russell, they were able to launch a massive missile, a Breacher, twice the normal size. The fire spread to the airlock control room as they watched their missile head towards the pirate ship. A direct hit and the pirates' vessel split apart at the seams, the explosion barely visible against the hot orange sun. 

The Kumbak Kruiser was victorious! Or so we thought. The fire, those beautiful people, could no longer seek medical attention. They both rushed to the med bay to put out the fires. Russell got there first, spraying valiantly with his fire extinguisher. Debbie got there too, just a few steps behind. But itwas a few steps too many. Russell was dying quickly. Debbie, ever the survivalist, left Russell to burn and ran out of the room. 

Only Debbie was left now. Sweet

So she ran to the very back of the ship. The airlock didn't even work anymore- a quick death would not be greanted. When the fire reached the camera control room, it came to claim its final prize. Debbie burned up, dead, just as the Kumbak Kruiser burst apart, spraying debris into the atmosphere of the sun, debris that would burn as quickly as the crew had.

God bless the crew of the Kumbak Kruiser. They were heroes to the very end. Except Debbie,False,,t5_2tnu1,False,,,t3_1019i6

--------

I decided to make a forum account and practice my writing after a particularly memorable campaign. This might be a bit long.

I bought FTL towards the end of the Steam Summer Sale after having it recommended by a friend

I might be a bit weird in that regard

After a few failed campaigns playing with crew named after Mass Effect characters which got me acquainted with the game, to give the characters slightly more unique names (or as close to unique as my naming-impaired brain can come up with - I swear, if I ever have children and have to pick names, they are *screwed*). I got significantly farther on that first playthrough with those new characters than I ever had with my Normandy crew, though that was probably due more to luck than anything else. Nonetheless, I decided then that I would continue using the ""same"" crew, on the same systems I had them manning in the first campaign

As I played through campaign after campaign, the crewman I had manning the engine room, was always the first to die.

*Always*.

Most of my campaigns ended with no crew deaths prior to the inevitable game-over... except for Davis. Whenever a random event decided to give me the short end of the stick; whenever an inconveniently placed deoxygenated room claimed a life; whenever a single missed click gave a boarding party the second they needed to finish off a fighter - Davis was inevitably the poor bastard who bit the dust. Every. Time. It's like his biography was written by Steven Moffat with a foreword by George R.R. Martin. A few times he even died within the first two jumps of the game. My own incompetence probably played more of a part in this than I'd like to admit

After telling my friend of this pattern, now taking bets on how long Davis will last!"" ""Oh, wow, the Mantis I bought died one jump after we got him, even Davis thinks he's a pussy!"" And so on. If Davis weren't just a collection of pixels on my computer screen, I might have felt bad for the mocking we gave him.

It got to the point where, killing one of my crew members. But it wasn't Davis who took the bullet. It was my pilot.

In all of my previous playthroughs, she'd never been killed by a boarding party... She *would not* go down unless she went down with her ship. So hopefully you can understand my shock when all of a sudden she's casually killed off, without so much as a fight, before she could even get out of the gate - and Davis remains alive.

I wish I could say I continued that game. I wish I could say that I put Davis in the pilot's seat in her stead

The *next* campaign

By the time I reached the Last Stand, and gotten two stars in engine control while he was at it. I had planned this more as an attempt to unlock new ships than an attempt to beat the flagship - I had been well on my way to [unlocking the Crystal Cruiser](/spoiler), but couldn't find the [Rock homeworlds](/spoiler) in time. I had a Burst Laser II, a Hull Smasher Laser II, and a Halberd Beam. Not too shabby at all, but I wasn't feeling particularly confident in my ability to defeat the flagship, because I had gone up against it in an earlier game with that exact weapon loadout and still had my ass handed to me. I had a higher-than-normal collection of scrap, likely due to the extended amount of aimless wandering I had done in an effort to find the different ship quests. Almost all of it immediately went to power upgrades before I went into battle.

After a fairly easy and generic first round against the flagship, so my only real hope for avoiding destruction was keeping my captain in the pilot's seat and Davis in the engine room, then crossing my fingers. This became problematic, though, when I had Davis leave the room to help my Rockman put out a fire faster. As if on cue, a boarding drone landed in the engine room, causing a breach as it started to shoot up my engines. I sent in my [Crystal](/spoiler) and Engi, and the rest were either manning or fixing broken systems)

As I sent the two to the med-bay, but not low enough, I thought, for Davis to take out before needing to retreat and giving the drone the last second or so it needed to damage my engines. As I watched his health closely between shots at the flagship, ready to pause and order him to haul ass out of there when the time came, my mouse hovered over his portrait.

As I looked at his character information

He had a green star in combat.

To some, I hadn't even noticed how often he'd been thrust into combat against boarding parties and drones in that playthrough alone. Thinking about it now, he had been up against every one of the several boarding parties that had been thrown at me - rarely alone, but always there.

And that just sums it all up, suffocated, shot at, and slashed to pieces more times than I care to count. He's been infected with deadly viruses, eaten alive by space spiders, burnt to death in malfunctioning research stations, Benjamin Button'd by crazed Zoltan elders

But he keeps coming back.

He'll *always* keep coming back.

Because he's Jonathan fucking Davis

The drone exploded. I don't know how much of it was due to the paltry 10% damage bonus from the combat star and how much was due to me poorly predicting the amount of health the thing had left, so I immediately send Davis to the med-bay with barely any health left. My evade chance was kept intact for the rest of the encounter, and I avoided taking enough damage to be killed. After another few volleys of shots, the right side of the flagship broke apart, and I sent my crew in to repair breaches and damaged systems, beginning with the engine room. Davis settled immediately back in once oxygen refilled the room, and I jumped after the flagship

It seems a bit anticlimactic to say the final phase went by rather uneventfully. Timing my cloak against the laser power surge was easier

With one last Halberd Beam sweep, I might add) and the name of my crew was displayed on the screen. And for once, Davis stood atop that list - the Redshirt Who Lived.

From now until the end of the earth (or my interest in FTL, that guy will be Davis.

* Beam weapons are sooooo fun. Strafing someone's shields, and other critical systems with one fell swoop is awesome. 

* Toggling your Ion Blasts back and forth between enemy systems can leave them with pretty much their whole ship disabled.

But I think it'd be fun to control larger crewed ships

How cool would it be to have a legit bridge, 2 pilots, weapons officer, shield controller all in the same room (would this be a good idea with boarders/fires? maybe so, actually).  Think about the bridge on Star Trek or something, or Battlestar Galactica.  You would still have true subsystem rooms (shields, weapons, engine) like FTL has now

I understand part of the excitement in FTL is the fact that you have to swap people around roles in combat when the s**t hits the fan, or something.

The Drone system could either be replaced or amended with ""fighters"", but can have defensive assignments (defend ship from enemy fighters) or offensive (target primary enemy).

With a larger crew and a larger ship, fires bigger. Medbays bigger, blast doors even more important.

The bulk of my upgrades go to more weapons (typically level 5/6), fuel, improved doors until later sectors where i rake in the scrap to get a 3rd shield and many more engines.

All this leaves little time for teleporting

Since they're mostly ineffective until shields are down, you have to micromanage more, and the result is usually equal or lower damage than lasers or missiles (at a higher power cost). In particular, I can't imagine them working well in sectors 6+, where almost everything has 3-4 shields.

What I'm looking for here is input on what is the best way to grind towards getting the right events. Here are my rules so far with my justifications:

* ~~Use the Red-Tail. I'm thinking this has the best offense early on to more quickly to blow through ships.~~

        EDIT: It has come to light that the Rock ships may be the best way to go. See comments below. 
* No boarding or otherwise milking ships for scrap. This takes too long.
* Head for Rock Controlled Sectors, but the FTL Wikia page says that's where you have to look to find the Dense Asteroid Field Distress Call. 
* Once in the right type of sector
* Once you have the Damaged Stasis Pod, Zoltan Homeworlds, and Zoltan Controlled Sectors to find the Zoltan Research Facility. Again at the advice of the FTL Wikia page.
* While looking for the Zoltan Research Facility, or distress calls. (Please tell me if this one isn't accurate!) 
* With the Crystal crew member
* If I'm halfway through the sectors and don't even have the Stasis Pod

1348001562.0,103kds,Share your knowledge of the skies,thesreynatwork,36,8,61,"Tips

I'll post my tips and update this post with other people's responses! I primarily do Kestrel Normal runs

* The Kestrel has some very interesting possibilities in terms of anti-boarding. If you're happy to fly around with ~70-75% O2

* Combine the above tip with Level 3 doors. Even if you don't

* Never, or you might ""never use it"". Hold onto that thing. It's a low power cost, fast charging weapon that **penetrates shields**. A single Artemis volley can be the difference between your hull being rent in twain and your enemies. Most useful for quick, strategic elimination of priority systems, namely shields, weapons and cockpit.

* Pulse laser's charge a bit faster than hull beams, in terms of charge.

* **Farm Sectors**. I know it's an in-game tip but it warrants repetition. Difficulty ramps up as you go through the sectors. Have a look at the map each time you jump to a new sector. Plan out the route you can go that will get you the maximum number of encounters. Skirt as close as you can to the rebel fleet.

* On the above

* Before you go for your first jump of a run

* [From another thread

* Shields are your friend. Assigning your beginning crew members is always a tough choice

* O2 upgrades may seem less useful than many other things

* Auto Pilot upgrades are a luxury. You will typically always have someone in your cockpit and in the very rare occasions that you don't

* Learn your opponents weapons. The faster you can identify them

* Fires and Breaches have tells, but more importantly you can hear if your ship is on fire. This applies even if there are no system indicators (i.e. fire in empty rooms). Similarly, you can hear breaches, but they're more difficult to locate than fires. Try and keep track of where you've been hit by things like beam weapons and missiles, as these are your most likely locations.

* Drone control is expensive, such as the hull repair drone.

* Weapon Pre-Igniter's give you that oh-so-critical first salvo. Expensive and rare

* Want to power-level your crew? Find an enemy that can't hurt you. Bonus exp for your weapons guy if you have an Ion weapon. Set to auto-fire, not something I do (Because I'm hardcore GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR). [See this thread for the original!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/zyssi/how_to_max_out_your_pilot_and_engineer_early_on/)

* Mantis sectors suck. Slugs are worse.

* Your medbay is something that should never

* Be careful with nebula jumps that halve your reactor output. The game likes to strip power out of your O2. Similarly

* Hoard your scrap. At some point you will have to make a choice (repairs, don't just spend scrap for the sake of spending it. For example, getting your second shield point requires two shield upgrades + power. That's around 80 scrap minimum right at the start (25 + 40 + 15, I think) and that's if you're only buying one bar of power. If you spend that 25 scrap, or that 15 scrap, that's a choice you can't undo, and the game may throw you a curveball where you needed that scrap for something else.

* Not really helpful

From frsvm:

* Don't branch out too much. Stick with the strongest weapons system you find in the first few sectors and then build your ship around it.

* Explore. Never take the short route; try to visit as many systems as possible before the rebel fleets gets close. So much more scrap

* Never risk your crew. A lot of events have options like ""send over someone"" - this is often a 50/50 chance your crewmember won't return. 

* Always destroy ships instead of accepting surrender unless they're offering something you desperatly need (i.e. 6 fuel when you're running out of it) or when they offer a weapon/tech that'd sell for more than you'd get from destroying them (which is the case with most but the basic items)

* In combat, but weapons, especially missiles, will ruin your day. Take out their guns and keep shelling the subsystem so they can't get it up again.

* Several ""small"" ship upgrades are worth their weight in gold. Doors

* When you can

* If a shop has them, quests) much easier, and helps avoiding nasty stuff (asteroid belts, stars)

* Get a lot of crew; the more, and most importantly, more people for extra dialogue options. ""Blue text"" solutions to scenarios will often reward more and better stuff, and most of them are triggered by having a diverse and large crew.

* If you can, or cloak before initiating combat and open fire as you uncloak, taking down their weapons before they can fire a single shot.

* Focus fire dangerous subsystems first (such as the tri-missile launcher on a certain ship)

* Use enemy ship layouts to your advantage. Several ships have rooms that cannot be accessed at all; if you destroy these, the crew inside can't receive backup

From BroganMantrain:

* In regards to O2 upgrades, just so they can take extra damage before being completely disabled.

From TrainerDusk:

* My favourite tip: Killing the enemy crew without destroying the hull will yield much more scrap and the possibility of a weapon drop. 

* Boarding parties consisting of 2 mantis/rockmen are better than any other race.

From ssercomic:

* Do not board auto-piloted enemy ships.

* They do not carry oxygen onboard and your crew will suffocate.

* Also

From DunkTheLunk:

* 1 tip: Keep Calm

From landroid:

* Missile management. Only use what is necessary to disable the weapons system in the early sectors since 90% of your encounters will be with only one shield unit. Losing the ability to fire your only shield penetrating weapon mid game can cause you to take quite a beating. Plus

From ElelloN:

* If you have teleport level 2

From GreenZanbato:

* If the enemy has a cloak

* Teleporting bombs

* The game will often try and trick you out of cool things, and you get a let them live option with no reward next to it, you get a cool bio beam that kills enemy crew or some information. The bio beam is cool but the info leads to a quest that unlocks a fancy new slug ship. 

* If you happen to have a fire weapon and some rock crew

* If you're trying desperately to unlock a ship

* Evasion is very

* If you haven't gotten a new layout yet

* Try to learn the outcomes of certain choices. Some choices are always one or two outcomes.

From longdrinkmcg: **UNCONFIRMED**

* I power down my weapons before I jump sectors as I believe there are some fights which you can avoid by going into the sector without your weapons powered (and even get some help sometimes.) Mostly the events where you are mistaken for an enemy. If you are fast with the pause
