1371006149.0,1g664w,"My UN is Pickle, I'm currently number 9 on Ladder playing Energy, and here are my thoughts on the game so far.",Theendersgame,134,128, so I'm excited to get to play and discuss strategy with my friends.

Right now

I'd like to talk about a bunch of different issues and points

1) (already known) The deckbuilding interface doesn't give as many options as I want it to. It would be nice to be able to sort decks by cost, not when I click on them. It would also be nice if there were private chat, friends groups, clans, etc but I know that that will come in time.

2) There are not enough Scrolls currently available. This is the biggest issue for 2 colored decks

3) People who say that Order is underpowered haven't figured out how to optimally play it yet. I say this because I smashed Order really badly with my Energy deck (even a couple of days ago when I had a few questionable cards in it). Then I ran into Blinky

4) Energy is underpowered. I know that many people will see this and be shocked since energy has op removal like Violent Dispersal (not op), so to win you have to try and reduce your opponents board presence. The problem with this is that to do this effectively you must be doing this and generating card advantage. Therefore we have to rely on our smaller creatures which are pretty mediocre and things like Clock Library and Shock Coil to edge out advantage over time. We can also rely on structures but those are not good for the most part because we can't move them to follow our opponents angle of attack. Furthermore, our really good creatures that we plan on winning the game with are terrible if we are being (iron golem and scattergunner are both very susceptible to being attacked by faster creatures). So we have to rely on these spells to stay ahead. The problem is that Violent Dispersal, while good, basically takes a whole turn to use and is our only answer to some threats. Thunder Surge can be insane, but if you are aware of it it is so easy to play around often nullifying its use at all. Burn is not very good because a lot of the creatures that you want to kill as energy all have 4 toughness (haste dude, wolf dude, lots of other things) and having to take 2 turns to kill things puts you behind. Furthermore, negating our main sources of getting an advantage. Also our ways to take cooldown off of our units are global in comparison to the other two

5) Quake should not be in the game. I'm fine with growth players being able to draw cards and play insanely efficient and hard to kill creatures and then being able to make them more hard to kill, as we have such little early game power compared to the other two factions.

6) The Economy is healthy and very well thought out by the creators of the game. I wouldn't change a thing other than maybe change the rate at which you get gold and the way that that works with winning/losing

I hope that you made it to the end,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,,t3_1g664w

However

I understand that they want to avoid future 'Noadi incidents' by testing the cards in a controlled environment first, and bugs. We bought in because we were excited to help Mojang shape the game. Instead, the Test Server acts as the true Beta, and the rest of us are just playing a pre-balanced product with little opportunity for content-related feedback. 

I feel the Test Server should remain intact for testing new features, as far as the scrolls themselves are concerned, I think Mojang should reconsider their decision to not let the entire Beta community put them through their paces. We're all adults, we can take being exposed to a 'Noadi' now and again. Furthermore, I think it'll go a long way toward making some people feel as though they're actually participating in a Beta, and not just playing an unfinished game.

The bot is ScrollsPost in-game and it sits in Trading as well as Trading 1 - 15. If I missed a trade channel, but from comparing prices on ScrollsPost vs in-game, they seem to be pretty accurate.

Depending on time of day, etc), naturally I can't do much if someone decides to spell Noaidi as Naoadi right now, but I'm happy with a ~95% success rate.

Messages are deduped to 5 minutes, rather than 50 entries of quake.

Prices are calculated using the 95th percentile average

I have the raw price data, I'm open to it.

The number next to the buy and sell price is how many entries we have

Prices are updated as

***
Full Set Review: 8/1/13
***
Decay:
***
1.	Animore: Needs to be castable on opponent’s creatures. Then we would have an extremely powerful card on our hands. Please let this happen because I want to play with that card so bad. Feel free to increase its casting cost in this case. Otherwise

2.	Arthritis: Kill braves and vaettrs just fine

3.	Atrophy:  Not playable

4.	Bitter Root: Welcome to the team of unplayable walls. Better than ilthorn because it does 3 damage instead of 1. 

5.	Blightbearer:  A very interesting  card. It has a ton of interactions with decay cards. Nutrition it as a surprise poison a row. Miasma well to help it kill itself so it can do 6 damage to a row. Use it deter your opponent from a lane. Use it as a 3 drop heavy hitter. This card is pretty cool. It isn’t amazing in play

6.	Brainlice: Burn but better. Pretty solid card. Wording on it is misleading because “poisoned” is not a keyword (see ranger’s bane) and suggests that the poison damage is indefinite which it is not. Would not be upset if the “draw 1 scroll” clause was only during the duration of the poison. “If enchanted creature dies while poisoned

7.	Cluster Hex: This would not be OP if it affected the whole board for 3 turns: See corrode. Is obviously supposed to combo with mire curse. Weak card atm. 

8.	Cursemonger: Solid creature. The curse is often more relevant than I thought it would. Please change scroll art back to its original. To creepy atm. 

9.	Damning Curse: Scroll was recently nerfed to not affect structures and only creatures. It is “ok” and I have found myself wishing it did more. The one damage to all your stuff is more relevant than you think. This card is almost weak enough to be cut from decay decks atm despite the effect being insanely powerful.
 
10.	Draining Mist: Great art

11.	Energy Siphon: Now we are starting to get close to the kind of cards we need to make dual colored decks. Close but not perfect. Similar effect as kabonk in a D/E deck. 

12.	Grisly Graft: Combos with animovore =D. This card has a place in the “death matters” deck and should not be overlooked. Requires more testing. 

13.	Hex Marks: Haha

14.	Husk: 3/3/2 Zombie for 1 

15.	Ilmire Hunter: Slayer is really strong. Don’t know if we really want this as a mechanic and will have to be heavily rationed. This card should probably have its health reduced by 1 for balancing issues. 

16.	Ilmire rot eater: Great card. Absolutely solid. Combos with grisly graft and animovre =D. Can steal games. For some reason I keep feeling he should have 1 attack and relentless. 

17.	Ilmire Witch Doctor: Solid card with solid effect. Similar to Cannon Automaton. 

18.	Infect Gravelock: I like the idea of having “move” as a keyword and hope to see “move 2” or “move 3” as keywords or even a structure with “move 1” (see metal wonder). This card is meh. Again… we need to universalize “poisoned” as a keyword. I honestly don’t think this card needs to have move 0. It would be a solid card as a 1/2/3 with normal move. 

19.	Infectious Blight: Used to think this card was broken. Now I think it is a little awkward. The effect NEEDS to proc off of curse. “if enchated unit is killed by poison or curse damage…..”. Pretty interesting and a chance for huge card advantage gain. I like the card

20.	Languid: Solid card. Another kabonk effect. Maybe a little bit stronger in terms of early game control. It virtually kills a brave and draws you a card. Not unbalanced

21.	Lifestealer: I used to think this card was just a playable creature. My opinions recently changed about this card after realizing how little combat damage decay has. 4 damage will end up seeming like a ton when you start playing with this card. It will help you beat down structures and idols. This card will become a core staple to decay decks once people realize they can’t kill structures. (Decay currently loses to waking stones). 

22.	Loyal Darkling: I love this card! Its effect being unconditional makes this card really good and should be a template for how “sacrifice” effects should be (I’m looking at you clock library and sinmarked zealot). 

23.	Lumbering Muckhead: Scary good card. Wins more cards for decay than any other card. Its butt (toughness) seems too large for the cmc. Compare it to mortars and peoples’ heads might explode. 

24.	Mangy Rat: This card may be better than people think. It does 4 damage to creatures when it connects to a creature. Kills a brave in 1 hit. Don’t overlook this card. 

25.	Miasma Well: This card is a disaster in the mirror. Please make it affect only its controller’s poison damage. I dislike this card more than others do. I do not think this card needs to be nerfed. It provides really cool synergies. Would not be upset if it casted 3 or had its health decreased by 1. 

26.	Mire Curse: Better or worse blind rage? I’m torn on this card and don’t know which it is yet. This card has a lot of potential power. I don’t know if it is intended for this card to effect structures when the enchanted creature is next to it. This is the only way to do poison damage to a structure and doesn’t make sense in terms of flavor. 

27.	Necrogeddon: Anyone that thinks this card is OP is wrong. If anything this card could do with a buff. This card is only good in a game where you are losing

28.	Oblivion Seeker: A necessary card for decay. Honestly

29.	Pestis: So close to playable by itself. Relentless will proc this multiple times. I have high hopes in the future for this card

30.	Pillar of Disease: Ug….

31.	Pillar of Fatigue: Double Ug….. both these cards could do with a buff. If they had double their effects I’d be willing to start talking about these cards. Also

32.	Puppet Soldier: Works with nutrition =D. 

33.	Regeniture: I like the idea of increasing my creature’s health pool. I don’t want to spend a card to do this though. Cool art

34.	Restless Bones: I have really high hopes for this card and could see myself screaming for nerfs in the future but for right now

35.	Return To Nature: Why is energy siphon unconditional and this isn’t? Please make the growth gain unconditional. Currently

36.	Scavenger Construct: Better than useless contraption. 

37.	Searing Shackles: My god I want this card to be good. I want to make this card playable. Its effects are super huge and could win games. Kill a creature

38.	Shroud of Unlife:  This should make two husks… otherwise why don’t I just play husk (which I wouldn’t do anyways). 

39.	Soul Scrounger: This is a super cool creature name. Just saying. The effect is fine. Might be more playable then people think. 

40.	Soul Steal: I’ve come to find this card to be unplayable. Wish it just did 2 damage and if a creature died make a muckhead. Currently

41.	Staggering Muckhead: Damn you RNG for ruining things that are almost good. 

42.	Tethered Recruit: Probably the best memorial in the game. 

43.	Totem of Suffering: This card might be nuts. I don’t know yet. Its effect is stronger than you think since you can control it. It is very similar to blood artist (so rat spam and necrogeddon them all)

44.	Unbind: It is fine. 

45.	Viscera Sage: There is value to be had in this card. It is just hard to get out of it. Fine creature
***
Energy:
***
1.	Corrode: Ok

2.	Storm Runner: Cool and logical step in card design. Stats aren’t right. Would rather it cost more and do more. As is, bombard, and desperation” it is absolutely but energy does not have IR to help fill its hand with that combo. The card really is just too big in terms of art. It doesn’t make sense when on board. 

3.	Metal Wonder: Despite what iscream would say

4.	Solemn Giant: People will disagree with me
***
Growth:
***
1.	Crone: Doing its worst puppet soldier impression

2.	Sister of the Bear: 4/2/4 for 4. I would love this to have interactions with bear paw

3.	Breaker: Solid three drop creature that is much needed in growth decks. 

4.	Rat King: Oh boy this card is dumb.  Understand this card was patched immediately to cost 4 instead of 3. This is not the proper fix for this card. At 4 the card is still a 3/6 for 4 across 3 bodies (which is good for crimson bulls and godhands) but is super clunky because you can no longer get fertile soil value and joins the ever increasing list of 4 drops. Please keep it at 3 and only produce 2 rats.
***
Order:
***
1.	Wings Shield: Seems solid. I like the idea of “x” effects.

2.	Wings Soldier: 3/2/2 for 2. Won’t see play probably besides in the GO 2/2 deck. It is just worse than x-bowman

3.	Fleetness: Ok… so when I first saw this, then I played it again and said, “ug”, THEN I played it a third time and removed it from my deck immediately after. To save myself the reply in the comments I’m going to lengthily explain this card here. So this is an enchantment which is generally considered bad. The only good ones have immediate effects of saving or killing a unit you otherwise wouldn’t be able to: i.e., potion of resistance or stagheart. This card has NO IMMEDIATE effects and requires an entire attack rotation to even become relevant. It effect is cool but it often won’t do anything for at least 3-4 turns. I never expect a creature to last more than one combat cycle anyways unless I have accelerants. This does not accelerate. Maybe in some kind of potion resistance build this card can find a place but does not need a nerf at all. I personally wouldn’t run it even if it costed 1. 

4.	Redeploy: Why does this cost 5

I understand that there is potential for abuse

The current way of abusing the system would be to just keep quitting games at turn one until you get what you think is a winning hand. This form of abuse is much more annoying as the two players aren't agreeing to abuse together

There were an additional three cards teased nearly a month ago along side the last released three. They have been on the test servers for weeks now

This might not be so awful if there weren't currently only 141 scrolls available. And this is the crux of what I believe gives us the cause for concern.

Scrolls is a self titled ""beta"" and only recently released. Which excuses the extremely low card pool. Yet simultaneously it makes the maddeningly quiet development all the more strange.

1375397518.0,1jizm1,"As we approach Scrolls' first big set, I hope Mojang keeps in mind that it is a computer game, not a print TCG",DysprosiumJudas,90,48, where every player needs to be able to throw together a deck only using boosters from a single set

That's because only a shockingly small percentage of cards that Wizards prints actually see usage in tournaments. Wizards even invented a format called Standard which only uses the most recent blocks of cards so as to have some format where new cards could be relevant in a scale big enough to encourage interest in the new sets. Only an incredibly tiny amount of cards will survive to Modern (and usually none or almost none for Legacy). Wizards prints about 500 new cards a year

Scrolls, they can finetune balance instead of merely banning OP cards and letting weaker cards just disappear into the milieu. They should take a cue from League of Legends, which has an entire team of employees focused purely on preserving balance, and focus on increasing the pool of viability. Viable cards &gt; junk, and with the ability to patch cards, I don't see why we need to have junk.

I'm going to say it now, because TCGs thrive on options and situational cards, but there should be a place for every single card. Perhaps its very niche, perhaps it only fits in with a certain kind of combo deck, or maybe its only good against a certain color or deck type, but somewhere, no matter how small, then Mojang really should take the opportunity to either balance it

I know it'll be hard, and yes, most likely Mojang will have to slow the release of cards down slightly to compensate, but I think a culture of fine-tuned balance instead of Magic's fire-and-forget printing style will result in a drastically better game. The upside of this is that competitive players only play with viable cards, and balancing will drastically increase the amount of viable cards whereas straight printing will only increase the pool of viable cards very gradually.

And frankly, and if Mojang has the ability to fix them, why keep them? The gap between pros and newbs shouldn't be just what cards they're using, it should be HOW they're using their cards and how they arrange their decks with those cards. Yes, the balance will never be perfect, and not EVERY card will be useful, but Mojang is a talented enough group of people that I believe that they can get reasonably close.

The reason a computer TCG is exciting is the ability to edit cards post-release and create a deeply balanced game. If Mojang doesn't utilize this strength

**tl;dr mojang should balance cards instead of just leaving them as-printed because viable cards are more fun than junk**",self,t5_2scq0,1375398206.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jizm1/as_we_approach_scrolls_first_big_set_i_hope/

Introducing the **Scrolls Pro Tour**, in both EU and US friendly timezones that anyone can participate in for free. Each of these PTQs will have a small cash prize for the winner along with guaranteeing an invitation to the top 2 to join in the final tournament, the Pro Tour Championship. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pro Tour Championship will have a ______ Prize Pool that will paid down to the top 8. The tournament will have over 150 of the worlds top performing competitors weeded through using the PTQs playing through a 8 round Swiss style tournament. Top 8 competitors will be celebrated through twitch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my very initial concept of the tournament. I've discussed this on my stream and had a pretty positive response along with getting confirmation from other streamers that they can help me host tournaments if/when the time comes. Here's a list of things that would need to happen in order for me to actually move ahead with this:

* This post gets extremely upvoted
* A community call to arms to strong arm Mojang into actually endorsing this tournament financially and verbally. It is not our responsibility as a community to make this game competitive for ourselves. It is cool that we can host our own cash tournaments but it isn't fair to us and I won't host this tournament unless Mojang drops $2-3k into this tournament (This is bear minimum 5k+ would honestly be preferred). If this tournament does flop (which I don't have a problem with) this will at least be a valuable learning experience for the community to see how invested Mojang is in supporting us. 
* I need to find a way to pay myself and other streamers. Whether I skim some off of the prize pool or w/e
* We as a community will have to come up with a schedule that can work for as many people as possible. 
* Lastly myself and whoever else wants to help

Anyways

EDIT: Guess there are a couple of points I'd like to clear up:

* This wouldn't happen for months. If it were to happen I'd like for the championship to coincide with the official release date. 
* When I mean pay myself and other... I'm talking like 1-2 dollars an hour to help encourage myself and others to provide the most professional content possible. Especially considering that running the tournaments would almost consume my entire life for the month that the tournament is run. 

Please don't think of this starting tomorrow. This is meant to be a large professional event used to advertise the game. I ask you to view further into the future. Hope this helps clear some things up. ",self,t5_2scq0,1373944360.0,,flair-growth,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1icvp0/scrolls_pro_tour_initial_concept/

*****  

###[Scrolls Toolbox.com](http://www.scrollstoolbox.com)
####Collection Tracking and Trade Message Generation.  
No More Google Spreadsheets!

Sync your collection using our in-game MOD and use our app to track the cards you own. Automatically generate customized Want-to-sell and Want-to-buy trade messages based on your synced collection data. We use the latest pricing data from [ScrollsPC.com](http://www.ScrollsPC.com) and have a wide variety of customization options and filters.

*****  

To get started

I tried to make the process as painless as possible, or on the [ScrollsGuide form post for the MOD](http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&amp;t=1961).


*****

This came about while I was attempting to track my collection data in the quest to acquire a full playset.  Originally I was using a google Spreadsheet, and both the MOD and the site are open source, available from [my github](https://github.com/Tidwell?tab=repositories).

*****

~~It appears there is a bug when you have around 1000 scrolls you are trying to sync - not quite sure what the exact number is

This bug has been fixed in version 1.2 of the CollectionSync MOD. Restart Scrolls to auto-update.

*****

In the next few days I plan to be adding:  
- Additional support for ScrollsPost and trading.ScrollsGuide pricing and aggregation  
- Exclude Checkbox (so those pesky Junkyards and Ilthorns won't show up in your generated lists)  
- Quantity overrides (maybe you want 5 speeds?)  
- Remember Me for Login  
- Developer REST API so you can grab a user's collection info based on their in-game name without having to write a MOD  
- Additonal Settings and server-side option storage  
- Card image updates to reflect the latest changes

Before we start

With that out of the way

The daily discussion will be a place to discuss one scroll, how you counter the scroll, or ask questions about the scroll, I'm guessing you get the gist of this.

So for discussion #1, let's take a very well known and very used scroll, the infamous Kinfolk Brave.

Kinfolk Brave - 2 Growth

2 Attack

1 Cool Down

2 Health

You most likely all know him

If he isn't played against me, and have a few focus scrolls in my hand, nothing is going to stop me from wrecking a lane, unless the opponent shuts him down quickly.

That in my opinion is the 'tricky' aspect of this scroll: If you don't buff him up

Here is what would make an awesome game even better for a guy like me:

1)  **Correspondence games** - A different type of match with maybe a 24 hour turn clock.  Not that every turn would take that long

2)  **Harder AI** - I've been playing the AI a LOT and really working on my deck.  I can now beat the Hard AI pretty much every time.  It would be nice to have even more challenging AIs to play against.  Maybe even give the AI decks from some of the top players.

1372329982.0,1h66er,"Bombardcentric energy control deck, explained",iScrE4m,70,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1h66er/bombardcentric_energy_control_deck_explained/

Here's deck I'm currently using: http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#2917

3x Gravelock Elder

Gravelock Elders are one of the strongest units energy has. They might not be as good when they are on board alone, which is good enough for 5 drop. If you get 3 of them out, it's 3 5/2/7 units and you have a very high chance of winning the game at that point. When it comes to shielding priority, you don't want them as your primary shields, but they are definately not as important as cannon automatons, at least not when on board alone. Try to protect them, if you have more of them in hand, but put them in front of your cannon automatons. This is one of the scrolls you will see in every energy deck. He's ranged. He's beefy. He can be buffed really well. It also is a scroll you don't want to sacrifice unless neccessary.

3x Thunder Surge

While people often say ""people at higher rankings don't clump up"", let them fear your mighty surge. And if they fuck up, punish them. This scroll is even better if you have destroyers in your deck, it will force your opponent into weird clumping. I don't use them though and it's still good. In terms of sacrificing, you have to count how many surges you have seen so far. It's most common to see your whole deck by round 20. If you have your 3rd surge in hand by round 15, you really don't want to sac it.

3x Burn

Again, using spark+burn lets you essentially pay only 1 card, since it is mitigated by the scroll draw. It's not as optimal as burning 3hp unit, but it is less painful. I sacrifice burn only if I know my opponent is careful and trying to play around it (like playing only 4+ health units). It seems like I'm saying this about every card, but you don't really want to sac burn either.

3x Inferno Blast

Many people don't like IB, but if you have it in your deck, you'll find that draw very useful many times. Even damaging waking stones + weaking his units, there are soo many good things IB can do. You can sacrifice this scroll more often, I try not to sac it first few rounds against growth, so I have a way of killing his vaettrs and sisters of the fox (especially when he'll be hitting 4 resources for fertile soil).

3x Potion of Resistance

PoR is tricky scroll to use like every enchantment, it's one of the best scrolls you can have, he has no other option that to go away or run his greatwolf to deal 1 damage. It's one of the scrolls I have problems using to the best, but it is still very good and should be in every energy deck. Sacrificing potion of resistance isn't as painful. Again I'd take care about how many do I have left in my deck, you don't want to sac your potions on round 1 5 7 and then be without it when you might need it. 

3x Copper Automaton

Copper Automatons are more about mindgames. They might force your opponent to do weird things, maybe playing haste units/blessings of haste he would have had better uses for. Also shielding your fragile unit with copper automaton when your opponent is about to attack (or has hasted units) might be sometimes good. It's 2hp, but still 1 round blocker, situational and sometimes good. There are few mistakes many people do though. First and the worst mistake is playing him on your first turn. Doing 4 damage to idol is meaningless, you don't want to do it. Ever. Second mistake is whip/copper automaton on strong 5hp units. Unless you are ahead in cards, you're just giving your opponent bigger card advantage (paying 2 for 1) for a small stalling. It might be good in few situations, but don't do it every time there's 5HP unit on board. Oh and of course, I don't regret sacrificing copper automatons most of the time. You don't rely on him.

3x Spark

This is 1-1 card at best, surge+spark is not as rare to finish off one of the units left standing. I mentioned above that spark+burn is sometimes very good etc. etc. Try to keep at least one in your hand early game, to counter braves etc., but you don't need to hold on to it. If you draw it, it's good. Sacrifing sparks isn't the worst decision. Of course, don't sacrifice if you know you might need it in next 3-5 turns.

3x Cannon Automaton

This is the SHIT. He deals 5 damage. That's instakill idol with CF. That's almost every unit dead on his hit. Even 6hp ones with whip. You wanna protect this guy. Put him in back. Don't loose him. He's going to wreck your opponent. I did the mistakes of trying to abuse his 1 armor and using him as shield, put this guy in front, but don't risk him if you don't need to! His damage is too good!. You might be surprised, but I tend to sacrifice cannon automatons quite a lot. Of course early game, it's 6 cost unit, every 6 cost scrolls gets saced in your first hand, but even then. The thing is, he'll just die

3x Violent Dispersal

MUST HAVE. you have NO other way of dealing with beefy units in back. That might be Vanguard, Great Wolf, Knight Scholar... But even waking stones! It punishes enchantments, it helps mitigate board control of your enemy. Yes, you pay 6 for it, but it's better to pay 6 unit than to let your enemy summon mangy wolf/play speed next turn and wreck your face. Always try to have at least one in your hand.

3x Fury

This is one of the newest scrolls we are trying to play. Once you have board control and you don't run into bombards, it's not AS valuable, especially when you don't ahve other shit on board. (I might be wrong with saccing this, I've played only 6 or so games with it - always think before saccing something. And not 1 turn ahead, but maybe even 3-4 turns ahead, this is not your guide that you can do every game.)

3x Ether Pump

Next of our newer additions. Don't hide these in back. They are your walls. Good walls. They will summon your enemy and he'll attack it with everything he has if it's about to hit. He doesn't want it out. He wants to get rid of it. And that means he's not hitting your units, it's up to your personal preference, but libraries will disappear eventually. Sacing this? Well, walls aren't what win you the game and mortars are cheaper, but you want to shield your units as energy. So don't just get rid of it without thinking.

3x Gun Automaton

Cheap early game 2 drop, but he doesn't deal as much damage. With 2 cost, you can play gunner and gun at same turn for 5 resources, providing cheap and potentionally attacking wall if you get something next in front. He also survives quakes! Oh and you can sacrifice him most of the time. Put him out on turn 2 to start getting some board control, but he's not as core.

3x Scattergunner

4/2/2 3 drop, sometimes even behind cannon automaton, but that depends on situation. His weakness is he just dies to quake. And to 2 ragged wolfs, 2 kabonks... He's very weak, but he can deal massive amounts of damage. Don't get too carried away with them. They are also great with bombard. You will get to 6 resources every game and if you can gunner bombard and the gunner will survive next turn, you just killed his annoying unburnable 4hp brother of the wolf or whatever else. You can also play him same turn as Hellspitter Mortar. I usually sac gunner if I already have one out and want to focus on something more beefy later. While he's good, his 2 hp have to be taken into account.

3x Hellspitter Mortar

Your best friend. 3cost 6hp wall that can sometimes make you dance. If he hits, watch him survive everything. Or get pothered. Pothered mortar is sad, but you have to take it into account. That might happen. You can sacrifice them if you have board control with different stuff, but if you don't? Then he'll give you space to set it up.

3x Iron Whip

SO MANY USES. 1hp ""spark"" for your enemy if that 1 is all he has left. -1 countdown if you need to. +1 damage if you need to. BOTH if you need to. You will almost always find a use for it. It's good. That said

2x Concentrate Fire

This is the only spell I'm using 2 of. It is kinda situational, pay attention that you only have 2 of those in your deck. It's almost sure first round sacrifice, but later on you might find it veeeeery helpful.

3x Bombard

THE CORE. It only affects your units (and crossbowmen, even the unit you summon that round! So that's 5 cost gun+bombard, 6 cost gunner+bombard, 8 cost elder+bombard and 9 cost cannon+bombard. Try not to sacrifice them without those you will have HUGE problems controling the enemy board and keeping his units low. The more shit you have on board. The better bombard gets. And it also affects your hellspitter mortars for ultimate awesome lucky hits. Every opponent facing energy fears this. It might come at any point. It's our rally. It's cheaper. It's center of this deck. It makes this deck awesome.

****

And that's it. This is my deck. This is the purpose my cards have in it. I find it VERY hard to cut any scroll from it, ask away in comments and try convince me why I should use it, so there's a good discussion around it.

1372402996.0,1h8hdm,"My UN is Pickle, I'm Currently Number 6 on Ladder playing Growth, and it's been over two weeks, so here are some more thoughts on Scrolls.",Theendersgame,9, I gave up playing Energy after losing some very frustrating games to Growth and Order decks. After switching fully I found that it was fairly easy to outplay people playing growth

I want to preface this text once again by saying that I am really enjoying this game a lot. The sudden releasing of new cards was a blast and the addition of the Scrolls Mod thingy was a wonderful addition to the game and shows that the staff behind scrolls are hard at work at creating a wonderful CCG experience. I appreciate that a lot.

I want to start by talking about a few game-play concepts that are very relevant to Scrolls, the things that are most positively correlated with victory:

1) **Early Game Board Control**

This is simple. If you control the board and are able to stick quality units in the early game, an early lead will often lead to victory and against Growth, playing around Quake in addition to an early board lead will lead to victory a large percent of the time.

2) **Having a Backup Plan for Every Scenario**

ANY CARD CAN BECOME A RESOURCE OR MORE CARDS. This means that you have little to no excuse to run a solution to a problem card or a way of making your deck more resilient if there are things that you simply cannot beat as long as it is only 1 of another card. In addition

3) **Have a Curve That is Reliable** 

This wisdom comes from Magic: the Gathering. A ""curve"" refers to the amount of each card with a certain cost

4) **Control the Center**

Having units together (in most cases) allows you to have more powerful compositions and allows you to rearrange your units to best attack/defend from your opponent. If your opponent is split on the sidelines they do not have a choice in how they are attacking you or defending you. The only time this is not the case is against Thunder Surge but Energy never really has control of the board anyway so that's kind of a moot point.

5) **Having a Mid/Late Game Plan**

There are simply not enough scrolls and options to be only an early game deck

6) **Generating Card Advantage**

I just said that you need to hit your mid/late game cards by producing resources every turn, pump cards into resources so that you can pump out powerful cards. This card advantage can be generated through killing opponent units, drawing extra cards, or through gaining extra resources through cards (since a resource normally requires a sacrifice of a card and your ""pitch-a-card"" play for the turn).

Now, in my opinion, be thinking about, and to start a conversation with you all on this:

a) Right now

b) As its scarcity on the top of the ladder suggests as well as my personal experiences with it, it has few good endgame units, and no ways to make those endgame units better. Growth and Order both have good ways of cooling down units, while Energy has no good ways to do that. Energy has no way to gain extra resources, and no way to draw cards. The only thing that Energy has is that they are able to be very aggressive, but have no way to follow it up, and then the developers decided to give Growth Quake

c) Balance issues are not going to be fixed by releasing cards in small packets. Trying to fix ""the current op meta"" or whatever you want to call it is going to be fixed when an entire set is released. Right now, as it just cements further the problems we have now. The tools we need to combat the top decks are not individual cards but new ideas and new ways to build our decks. 

d) On the overall subject of Balance

e) The test server for new cards should be application based

f) I was trying to look up lore for the different factions but I couldn't find any on the website. I know that in Magic the lore and the background behind what each of the different colors is trying to do steers heavily what the cards are capable of doing. I think that it would add a lot more depth to the game if the different factions were more outlined by their goals as a faction.

g) The community is doing an incredible job of doing lots of streaming, and overall being very friendly. I really appreciate you all doing what you're doing and want to encourage you guys to keep it up! (I'm gonna get in on some tournament shenanigans!!) I would love to start some sort of State of the Scrolls things at some point.

I'll try my best to explain why I think so. Sacrificing cards for resources is the fundamental restricting rule in the game. You can only do it once per turn. Normally early on in the game

For simplicity's sake, and slightly worse than that late. If everyone is with me, let's continue.

Noaidi is a 3/2/2 creature. When you play it, *AND* you got to put one of them into play as a 3/2/2 for free.

I can only compare it to Sister of the Fox, you pay 1 more resource, you draw +1 card, and it has +2/+1. Wut?

Ok, you only get 1), you have to play yourself out of a 3-card hole in a situation where your opponent has access to more cards and more resources than you do and where he got to use his turn 3 drop (a turn you probably passed on). It's possible, but you would need to outplay the shit out of your opponent.

But you're thinking what if you just refuse to play Growth, right?

The problem is that the Growth player can splash to abuse Noaidi even more. Normally, then you have to give up 2 cards just to have the right to cast it.

It sounds like an overwhelming drawback, up to over 2000 Elo and second place on the ladder. The reason for the Order splash is that Pother is an amazing card for Growth to have access to, a card that's worth discarding 2 cards just to play. Among other things, it's an answer to Waking Stone and Potion of Resistance. Even the threat of the Order splash makes Waking Stone an unreliable card. Transposition is also in the splash and is extremely powerful.

I can testify that it's a good deck. I piloted Growth/Order Aggro to over 1900 (copied Manchy's build card for card, it was a great deck (best in the format, I think, hence why I switched to play it).

Now it's running Noaidi. If you're playing against Order, it's a 3 drop that gives you +2 card *advantage* in that matchup. That wrecks the balance of the game. Imagine you're an Order player. Just because his color has Naoidi, now he gets to play all of your color's cards for free? It doesn't even cost him any mana, because he got that mana for free with his 3/2/2 drop.

So there's only one matchup where Noaidi isn't broken sideways, but from what I hear and what I've seen, Energy has a lot of trouble with Growth, it's certainly not going to be the counter to keep Growth in check.

Of course, you get a 3/2/2, *and* you save yourself from having to discard 4 cards. Absolutely disgusting. Imperial Resources is *worse* than that and Imperial Resources costs 7.

If you both happen to be running all 3 colors

TL;DR Noaidi is a 3 mana 3/2/2 that lets you draw 2 cards when you play it. Sometimes it even lets you draw 4 cards. No other card is remotely as powerful as it is.",self,t5_2scq0,1371720663.0,,flair-order,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1gpuyv/mojang_we_need_to_talk_about_noaidi/

Anyway


**Question 1: When did you start playing Scrolls?**

Somewhat unsurprisingly, 31 of them did so on the very first day, indicating that they had been anticipating the games release.


**Question 2: What is your current Scrolls rating?**

24% of players have never played (or at least, with the most clustered bracket being 1601-1700, where 17% of players claim to be ranked, as well as 11% who lie in the 1701-1800 range. 3 players lay in each of the upper limits; 1801-1900, 1901-2000, and 2001+, however, seeing as only around 10 Scrolls players actually have ratings over 2001.


**Question 3: Which resource type is your favourite?**

The most staggering level of support lay with Order, for Growth, and just 22% for Energy, implying that Energy is the least favoured of the three resource types at the moment.


**Question 4: What type of deck do you play with primarily?**

75% of players that responded to the survey play primarily with mono decks, mono Growth with 21 and mono Energy with 18. As far as mixed decks go, Growth/Order is the most popular, with 12 votes, while Order/Energy and Growth/Energy have 6 and 7 respectively.


**Question 5: What is your favourite scroll in the game?**

Luckily, meaning lots to sort through! In the end, 3 scrolls tied for first place, one from each deck. Honorable General, Burn, and Kinfolk Veteran each received 7 votes. Other mentions should go to God Hand which received 6 votes, and Speed, Great Wolf, with a combined 7 votes for the Ducal and Royal counterparts.


**Question 6: How do you spend most of your time in-game?**

73% of players spend most of their Scrolls time playing some form of online matches, 6% trading, and 2% building decks. The remaining 5% prefer the social side of Scrolls, either challenging friends or hanging out in chatrooms.


**Question 7: Do you have any past experience with CCGs?**

32% of Redditors have no past experience with this genre of game


**Question 8: How did you first hear about Scrolls?**

37% of players heard about Scrolls through following Mojang, 9% through real-life friends, 3% through another CCG, and 13% through internet advertising. Also though, 20% of players first heard about Scrolls through YouTube, an option I stupidly forgot to include in the main selection bar, so the number is likely to be higher. Furthermore

**Morre's Job**

&gt;Trauc: Morre

&gt;Morre: i'm a programmer

**Testing**

&gt;Rubber_Duck: Morre do you have a Test team or is that everyones job?

&gt;Morre: we don't

&gt;Morre: we mostly test as we implement stuff

**Growth Balance**
&gt;Blinky: What I will say on the current balance of things is that the fact that it would seem that about 90% of people are playing Growth makes it seem like it is OP. It isn't OP however it is definetly the strongest.

&gt;Morre: blinky

&gt;Morre: like

&gt;Morre: so most people play it and learn it

&gt;Morre: and then people see others playing growth thinking

&gt;Morre: and so on so forth

**Card Text Clarifications**
&gt;Strill: Speaking of bugs

&gt;Strill: also Blast Strike doesn't spread his effect

&gt;Morre: strill

&gt;Morre: that's intentional

&gt;Strill: other cards like Blood Boil and Spiky DO take effect when things deal 0 damage

&gt;Morre: strill

&gt;Morre: blood boil and vengeance veil should possibly be changed

&gt;Morre: we'll make it more consistent eventually

&gt;TheDigitalChao: wai twait wait

&gt;TheDigitalChao: blood boil?!

&gt;TheDigitalChao: but i use it well in my wildling.

&gt;Morre: we're not going to change how it works

&gt;Morre: i just meant we'll change either dust runner or blood boil for consistency in ""deals damage"" interpretation

**New Order Spells**

&gt;Morre: there's a new order spell in the design documents that I think you'll like though...

&gt;Blinky: yay

&gt;Blinky: gimme

&gt;Morre: I haven't implemented and tested it yet

&gt;Morre: but man

&gt;Morre: not sure how to cost it yet :)

&gt;Blinky: does it say ""Iff opponent has a growth resource they lose the game and are not allowed to play a growth deck ever again""?

&gt;Morre: ...it's a very ordery thing

&gt;Morre: like

&gt;Blinky: oooooooo

&gt;Morre: just cool

&gt;Rky: target unit gains 9000 attack until end of turn

&gt;Morre: 9001*

&gt;Strill: Morre: Then is it

&gt;Morre: Strill no

**Noaidi Flavour Text**

&gt;Strill: Morre

&gt;Morre: strill ;)

&gt;Morre: maybe they do in scrolls

&gt;Morre: it's an inside joke of a sort

**Plate Armor Balance**

&gt;TheDigitalChao: Plate Armor all combat damage reduced by 1!

&gt;TheDigitalChao: turn it to ALL DAMAGE

&gt;Morre: TheDigitalChao: it was that way for a while

&gt;Morre: it was completely OP

**Probability: Scroll Packs vs Singles**

&gt;Zougkla: I just bought 15 single scrolls

&gt;Morre: zoug

&gt;Morre: random scrolls gets you 70%

&gt;Morre: packs give you 7/2/1

&gt;Strill: Morre

&gt;Morre: yeah

&gt;Morre: we're working on sinks

&gt;Morre: primary concern right now

&gt;Morre: at least one sink

**Win Rate Statistics**

&gt;Zrave: Morre I'm sure you have the actual win rates? :P

&gt;Morre: zrave

&gt;Morre: but I really don't

First thing you have to understand when playing a competitive card game: there is no deck that could guarantee you 100% win rate. Loses happen depends on luck of the draw even if you play the game perfectly. Game balance design can only minimize the luck factor but the card game nature will always maintain the fortune's impact.

The auction chatroom doesnt require any mods and it works great. I will just quickly explain how it works. You start by joining the chatroom: ""auction"". Every few minutes a new auction starts. The bot will pick a card from his inventory

These are the commands:

* !bid GOLD - Just the command to bid on the current scroll. GOLD is th e amount of gold that you want to bid
* !request SCROLL  - The command to request a scroll for the next auction. SCROLL is the name of the scroll you want to see.
* !announce - To see info on the current auction (Card
* !help - This gives you all the commands

Some other notifications:
* I did not write the bot
* All of the money made goes back to selling new cards for the stock 
* If you decline the trade or take to long to accept you will be banned for one hour (This is to prevent trolls bidding and not making the trade)

I hope this post gets more people in the room because right now its just a way of getting cards cheap instead of an actual auction. You can ask any questions here or in the auction chat room.

- We also inquired about the possibility of 'World Enchantments' - a spell or unit that would affect the way the game was played (think of the conditions in Trials), but they could!""

1376067651.0,1k1aml,What Energy needs and the inherent problem of pump creatures/structures compared to straight draw,Sho7gun,46,10,55,"So, and I play energy since the start. My rating atm is like 1890 or something

So why do I make this post? Because energy is still falling behind the other factions. Against growth, but it's still quite hard. My winrate did drop to around 60% from 80 against order (people learned better how to play them and play better against energy) So something needs to be done and I'm going to speculate here what can help energy and what the problem is right now.

So the most obvious problem energy has is that it doesn't have card draw. Now Mojang stated that they will never give energy card draw but give it stuff in which we can spend resources so we can save cards. This system is good, it makes it so you don't have to play cards. 

1. It doesn't cycle your deck. Now some might not agree, because you'll be sure to draw the cards you need more often. With cycling, if you play a card, you'll see that card back faster than when you wouldn't cycle. You would also get to the cards you need faster. This means that Energy needs to spend their cards far more wisely and make better trades, which also means there's less room for mistakes than with the other factions. Plus, you have to pray more to get that one card you need for this situation.

2. It doesn't give you more options. When you straight up draw

3. Energy can't splash well. Because we have to be more conservative with the cards and don't have another way to build up resources. Sure, you need to cast it twice, because you need to discard for order to be able to play it. Take into account that you have to be more conservative with your cards, splashing is a big risk. 

So what I'm trying to say really, as you always want to lessen the rng effect (reason why people only make decks that holds the minimum amount of cards and tries to make as few 2 and 1 offs as possible)

So how can we make sure to combat these problems. Well, and as we won't get cards that draw us cards, that solution is out of the question. Another way is to give us a card that builds up energy and isn't a different faction card. What card that should be, well, I'm not good at creating cards, so I'm not gonna bother, but I bet there is a good way. If we get something like this, so we can discard more for draw instead of resources

On a whole different note, it should be in the game (so description would be: 1E = Take the next spell scroll from your library with a different name as this scroll and add it to your hand) Would also help with the cycling and energy reliability. 


There are a few other problems energy has (like it can only really run a midgame agression deck)

And again

1373473801.0,1i0l8y,dragonfruut's Collection of 30 Tips &amp; Tricks,,49,9,24,"**Hello /r/scrolls community!**

*I started to play this game three weeks ago and wanted to share many useful 
things with you :)*

---

1)  If you have a lot of Gold and plan to buy many Scroll Packs you can simply buy a pack

2)  I suggest to sell old Commons, because it's not worth the time to find a buyer for these. (When buying a Scroll Pack you will get 7 Commons that you can resell afterwards for 175 Gold, so you only spent 825 Gold for 2 Uncommons and 1 Rare!) But new Commons are worth selling:

* Currently: Dust Runner

3)  These Uncommons are also not worth the time selling in trading rooms (at least in my opinion):

* Blind Rage, Ember Bonds, Faith Blessing, Frost Wind, Fury, Leeching Ring, Machination Mindset, Metempsychosis, Redesign, Vaettr of the Wild

They are only worth around 100 - 150 Gold each (the NPC gives instantly 50 Gold). But if you are really low on Gold you could try to make some profit from them aswell.

4)  Same thing with Rares

* Essence Feast

5)  You can be in more than one trading room (trading-1, then wait 10 seconds and paste it in the other rooms.

---

6)  [https://account.mojang.com/stats/3](https://account.mojang.com/stats/3) This website shows how many copies of Scrolls were already sold (as far as i know).

7)  Don't worry about starting to play Ranked Matches! Ranked points won't decrease until you reach a certain amount of them. I'm not sure here

8)  The scrolls from the PreCon Decks are worth (Commons valued 25 Gold each):

* Growth: 6000-6250 Gold
* Order: 5250-5500 Gold
* Energy: 5000-5250 Gold

Advice for new players: Start with the Order or the Energy Deck

9)  Memorials are almost core scrolls for multicolor decks

10)  The easy Trials can be won fast and are a great opportunity for getting some Gold! Care: A surrender against bots will be shown in your profile!

---

11)  When building a deck remember to select only 50 scrolls

12)  The game currently has no graveyard (scrolls will be shuffled back into your deck after you draw all)

13)  If you play multicolored decks: Don't forget you can sacrifice for example a Growth scroll for a Order or Energy ressource.

* Decay : 

Decay is probably coming out next week, everyone tested decay some people may stay on the game but mostly everyone already left again. Why is that ? It's still the same game we just changed the meta a bit, added some new cards. Mojang could add like 1000 cards in one hit it wouldn't change anything because it's still the same set up. You can satisfy some people for a short time with that, but you don't keep them in the long run.

* Trading / Cards / Gold : 

New players feel like it takes to long to get new cards, we print infinite cards and gold, but we can't print infinite new player sign ups. So we already getting to a point where Scrolls is not generating enough sign ups to maintain a healthy economy, if we raise the gold earning value, the inflation is coming even faster and there is no point at all to play scrolls except the obvious reason the FUN ( the reason why you play a game in the first place ), but it's not enough today.

* Crafting :

Crafting is a nice gold-sink if you already have tons of cards but the shiny effect is not enough. People need to recognize the value of a x9 crafted card

* Custom games :

Warcraft III is world wide the biggest game which is mostly based on custom games. Besides the real game people like to customize the game. Allow people to start a game with different values

* Draft : 

A simple one click draft solution in the client. People love draft

* Tournament system :

This is a nice feature to keep a lot of people interested. It's not important right now but it's a good thing for the future.

* Challenges :

Allow BO3 + BO5 challenges. Why not giving the option to challenge people for a value of gold and the winner gets 95% of the money

* Ranked system :

Add point decay for people who not playing at least one game every third day. Set up a real Elo system like chess. The system right now is far behind of any standard. After all changes set a date for a ladder reset so everyone is getting a new chance to achieve a higher rank. 

* Progress / Updates :

People need to see progress

edit 3: Thanks to fr0d0b0ls0n for [pointing out a major error in the calculations](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hps38/some_math_on_how_to_buy_cards/cawvq8b). The below table has been revised.

**Pack Type** | **Expected *Profit* Per 1g Spent** 
 :---|:--: 
Random 10-Pack | 0.53g
Random Scroll | 0.53g
Random Energy Scroll | ~~0.59g~~ -0.16g
Random Growth Scroll | ~~0.54g~~ -0.21g
Random Order Scroll | ~~0.48g~~ -0.27g



So, Energy seems to be the most valuable, mostly because Automata Forge is at ridiculous prices.~~ If you're looking for a specific set of cards, deciding what to buy is more complicated, and will be the topic of the rest of this post. 

------------------------

Here's a rule you can follow to decide whether to buy the rest of your scrolls from the market or the shop:

&gt;**You should buy the pack type in the store that will result in the *lowest total cost of packs* after buying the expected number of packs it would take to get *one* scroll from your wantlist

Whew, go buy the cheapest card on your list, then reevaluate according to the rule above.

This means that any card that costs less than 100g should be bought on the market if you're willing to take the time to do so. If you're only concerned with one faction

If you don't want to be bothered with selling any scrolls you happen to get that aren't on your wantlist, so let's revise that rule a bit to account to profit from trading:

&gt;**You should buy the pack type in the store that will result in the *lowest net cost* after buying the expected number of packs to get *one* card from your wantlist and then selling any cards not on your wantlist.**

Let's move on to an example where our wantlist only has 1 scroll.

------------------

Let's say you want that fancy new Automata Forge,000g since there are 30 total rares in the game, Automata Forge is a rare, and each 10-pack gives you one rare. 1-scroll packs have the same distribution over time as 10 packs, so they'll be same. With energy scroll packs, you will need to buy 10 packs to get a rare on average, and there are 9 rares in energy right now,750g which is much better. **But, so you should just buy it on the market if your goal is to get that one card and not be bothered with selling.**

Now let's take into account the extra money you could make from selling everything don't care about. In order to get that Automata Forge, 60 uncommons, and 210 commons. My spreadsheet tells me that the avg price for r/u/c is 584g/192g/80g. So that means we now have 29\*584g + 60\*192g + 210\*80g = 45,256g in extra cards to sell. Wow! **If we sell all the extras at market price, we now have made 15,256g in profit on an initial spend of 30k! That's a 50.85% profit!** Really, we shouldn't be surprised based on that initial table above. If we do the same math for buying energy scroll packs,590g, since we know the return is greater over time from the chart above.~~

-------------------

For another example, so you're only concerned with the initial cost of the packs you'll buy. Your want list consists of every card in growth. Buying a growth pack means you spend 175g and definitely get a card from your list. Buying a random scroll pack means you expect to purchase 3 packs for a total of 300g to get your next scroll. The obvious way to start is through buying all the cards costing 175g or less on the market. Done. Now we're down to 18 cards I won't list here. We need 9 of the 10 growth rares (.90), 8 of 15 growth uncommons(.53), and 1 of 47 growth commons(.02). If we get a growth pack the chance of getting a card you need is (.10\*.90)+(.20\*.53)+(.70\*.02) = 0.21. Let's round to 20%, a 1 in 5 chance. So we would need to buy about 5 growth packs to get any one card we need at a cost of 175g\*5 = 865g. A similar calculation for random cards results in (.10\*.30)+(.20\*.17)+(.70\*.01) = 7.1% chance. To get one card we need, we would buy about 14 packs for 1400g. So, we now buy all the cards that cost less than 865g from our list on the market. Now, all rares. Energy packs give a (.10\*.50)= 5% chance of getting one of those rares. **That's 20 packs for a total of 3500g just to get one of the last cards we need. At this point we should just buy all of our cards on the market.** But that's only because we currently believe selling cards is the devil.

Once again, don't make me do any more math. T.T

----------------------------

Because I know you need it:

**TL;DR Spend all your money in the shop, and you will get ALL the cards you want. Eventually. Buying cards from the market is strictly a convenience, and don't forget that when you spend gold on the market, you don't get that 50%+ return.**

There's a lot of variables that determine how much you make playing over time such as game type, how high you are selling compared to the market median, and how effective your advertising (or spamming) is.

I see so many threads about people that is seeking help in just winning their first match. Insted of keep answearing every single thread so did i decide to put up this thread that will hopefully help relieve some of work of answearing all these questions until this thread is buried in the reddit grave.


I am a high ranked order player and can only give tip of playing the game in general and how to play order




**GENERAL**


* 1 *Dont be afraid to lose Idols

The more Idols you have the harder it is to defend, and boardcontrol is what wins games.


* 2 *Keep it down to 50scrolls*

The reason is that the cards are re-shuffled when all the cards have been used (usully around turn 20) which means if you for example play out your honorable general and he dies, same goes with other cards like speed, great wolf, burn etc.


* 3 *Ignore idols and hunt down opponents units.*

As mentioned before, and what gives board control? several things, but without making it to complex so is the core thing that you have more units out then your opponent, so always hunt down your opponents units, that is all that matters.


* 4 *Always sacrifice every turn*

It do not matter if it is your honorable general, if you are not going to use the scroll within 2 turns then it falls in the ""can sacrifice"" category. Of course there is exceptions to this rule but you rather sacrifice to much then to little, 90% of times so will you have done the right choice in sacrificing.


* 5 *Let Idols tank damage and regroup 2 rows away if behind.*

If you are behind and lost board control (basicly your opponent have more units then you) then the best way to recover is not to put units infront of their army and stall for a miracle scroll. The way to do it is to let your Idol tank damage and put down units there your opponent can not reach you for atleast 2 turns and regroup your forces. Dont get me wrong


* 6 *The center row is the most vital one*

Whoever can control it have huge power in the game, and most importantly so do you choose if you wish to control the 3 idols from top to mid, or bottom to mid, it is really hard to try control 2 idols and a third seperate one several rows away from the other 2.


* 7 *Check some stream and youtube clip for more insight in the game* 

It can give you ideas at how to play the game, they have posted some good videos for newcomers.


* 8 *Rush to about 5resource and then get cards.*

Regarding sacrificing  so do i suggest that you only sacrifice to get resource and reach about 5-7


* 9 *Remember what you got and you know what you will get.*

As mentioned above, if you can keep track of the important cards, like knowing you have only got 2 skirmishers so far, then you know when your at turn 15 that getting the 3:rd skirmisher is quite high, if you are able to count the cards so will you be able to plan for the future turns alot easier.




**ORDER**


* 1 *Skirmishers are your sword

Skrimishers are the most important unit you have and needs to be protected at all cost (except for the cost of Honorable general)


* 2 *Precon decks are weak but not worthless.*

Every precon deck is bad but that do not stop you from winning, the shield very from spearman to infantrymen depending on if you face melee or ranged units, spearman is good against melee and infantrymen are cheap enough to tank the range ones.


* 3 *Manipulate the field with your spells

Another streangh within order is all their tricks, you can increase your movement and decrease your opponents as well as flip them around and several other scrolls to manipulate the playing field, these are the scrolls you have to use until you get the vital speed scrolls and such, these cards are not weak, they are just not prefered over speed and other scrolls.


* 4 *Keep eye open for your countdowns* 

It dous not matter if you have 8 units out and your opponent 2 if your units that are about to attack next turn keeps getting picked off.


***Against another Order***


* 1 If they open with crossbowmen


* 2 Only open with crossbowmen if you can defend him within the next turn


* 3Whoever gets the general first and manage to get speed or haste for him first is usully the winner


* 4 Pother is the answer for waking stones.


***Against Growth***


* 1 they have no range units so spearman is the big deal here


* 2 The spearman only last so long however, embrace yourself for that impact.


* 3 So how do you embrace it? well first of all hunt down their units all the time


* 4 If you get kabonk then try to save it for taking out that veitr of the wild


***Against Energy***


* 1 energy can play several kinds of decks, they must die.


* 2 If they are not gravelock then spread your units out, but of course try to not hug if posseble.


* 3 The key scrolls are the ones that manipulate positions against energy, energy has alot of structures that they can not move and enchantments that will stop you from getting into the backline, as well as hellspitter mortar standing in your way. These postion cards are the vital answers to it, it will mess up their plans heavily.

EDIT NOTE:I have seen some comments here that critique my tips, and there is no black and white answears, of course these tips will not secure you victory and of course there can be commented ""you can not just assume this becouse of this"" but i am trying to keep it simple here for the new people and stating what is generally true.

Couple ideas for cosmetic
- Idols. This could spruce things up a bit without affecting gameplay, can not only drive monetization but player attachment to defending and attacking idols.
- Unit appearances. This would take significantly more work
- Unit animations. Potentially tied in with unit appearance skins

Secondly, I think we can expect for its price to be raised to around $30-40 once it is finally officially released.

That, Hex) makes me and probably many others put off by the price point being offered by Scrolls.

1373557823.0,1i33ys,A guide on how to beat Order with Energy,Sho7gun,35,2,30,"Hello people

Some of you might know me, I'm Sho7gun and I play Energy. Atm I'm 1902, but I did manage to get to the top 30 (untill I got a massive bad luck draw streak and fell down into the abyss, from which I managed to climb out again). Now, it isn't easy climbing as energy, however, I managed to climb this far because I was lucky to play against a lot of Order.
I know a lot of you might think 'But Order beats Energy, because I tend to just win that matchup 80% of the time. How? Well, I'm going to tell you. Btw, you should not think you'll win everything by just reading this, because games still have RNG and you still have to think a lot during the games. Besides, it's not as easy as I'm making it sound, but in my opinion



First things first



You might think 'Omg, and pother does almost the same thing, but is far more versitile. Next, I don't use CF because it's expensive for what it does. And I opted to get rid of mortars in favour of outcasts, because mortars can be played around with through the use of pothers, and outcasts serve the same purpose but can still be moved and can reliably kill (and attack idols). 



Ok



Rule nr. 1: Be agressive. With that I mean start playing creatures immediatly. You want to build up your creatures as soon as possible. If you get an early forge, put it in front so you can use it as a wall and can still move through the lanes. However, if you don't want to use it as a shield, put it in one of the sidelanes in the middle. Reason being that you can still protect it. Other than that, play many creatures and be agressive (although watch out for skirmishers, don't hunt for them unless you have to, but that depends soley on the situation)



Rule nr. 2: Keep the board clear. With that I mean, do that instead of putting down a big creature. Order relies on having many creatures on the field to buff eachother and you don't want that. Generals are the first to go (see rule nr 3). After that comes the skirmishers. Then you can go for vanguards and stuff. Save that burn to kill a turn 3 skirmisher. You should care less about the spearmen. 



Rule nr. 3: ALWAYS KILL THE GENERAL! This means you want to keep your VD just for him. Generals win order games. He is the rally and the bombard for order, just get rid of him. Even when he's alone he's dangerous. 



Rule nr. 4: Beware of Mangonel + Speed. This combo has become very popular recently. Most of the time you can know if someone has mangonels. Most of the times they don't run waking stones or decimates when they run mangonels. So when you see those, it can only kill two units max, making it an even trade (and him wasting speed). After the mangonel has been played, kill the thing. Don't keep mangonels alive, cause live mangonels will bite you in the arse. So beware, don't clump up and make the mangonel trade as even as possible. 



And now for the 5th rule, you'll lose. They will always have it, even if they don't. Remember this one, as it might be the most important rule.



Energy doesn't win of Order in the lategame, but it can increase the chances of winning. So just play a lot, don't play to hastily, think about all options and know what your opponent can play in his turn to ruin your day. When you're keeping the board clear, it doesn't matter how many cards he has in his hand or how many resources he has through imp resources, everything he plays will die and he will make very bad trades, evening the card advantage in the hands out. 



If you have any questions, you can because I do stream sometimes during the day at twitch.tv/sho7gun. And watch other people play, even order players, because you can learn a lot about their thought process and why they do stuff. There are a lot of good players streaming, so do watch them and it can greatly help with your own game. ",,False,t5_2scq0,True

1373668773.0,1i6o26,Sub 10k in last 24 hours... What's the Deal?,Drachenlord,35,9,59,"Just logged in

This is a sharp decline from 20k+ when I started the game a couple of weeks ago.

So

The trading market is hurt, queues take longer, fewer games get played.. 

This is a great game

But it seems like there are some things that may need to be done to right the ship and stop the decline in active players. 

Crafting is not it...  I think releasing Decay may be the only thing that will save it

Anyone else got some opinions?  I'm trying to start a rational and calm and productive discussion here

The ScrollsPost mod from Summoner (as of v1.0.4/v1.0.5) now supports full replays recording and watching with opt-in uploading to ScrollsPost (automatic or ask after each game).

For watching replays

I made a little demo video showing the multi viewpoint feature which can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpKaWw_gQc0 (it's only about 30 seconds). Seeking to a turn will speed up and disable most of the animations/delays to quickly get to the round you're looking for.

Replays are logged using the timing you played with. If you take 20 seconds to move, but I'll add an option soon that lets you ignore it and play it on a set time period (X seconds per turn).

To watch a replay

---

Seeking/speed up/slow down is a work in progress. It's worked in my tests

Multi viewpoint requires both sides of the replay to work, you can download [this](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4230774-1/scrollspost-vs-shadowed) and [this](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4230774-0/scrollspost-vs-shadowed).


Those are the replays I used to make the quick YouTube sample video. I'll be making the process to view/download multi viewpoint replays better soon.

---

Once a replay is uploaded

You can also view a page for a [specific replay](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4226202-1/dracon_ian-vs-shadowed) where you can see a breakdown of the game including the cards played and how many times. There's also a [game graph](http://www.scrollspost.com/replay/4226202-1/damage/dracon_ian-vs-shadowed) which graphs out resources with damage done

Replays can be viewed per player too

Unfortunately, send me an email with the replays attached and I'll send you back the converted version.

Ways this could work: 

* Shiny scrolls have a shiny border which is very noticeable and looks cool!
* The figure on the board which matches the scroll, and it also has a shine to it.

When buying a pack of scrolls:

* Chance to pull a Shiny Rare Scroll- 1%
* Chance to pull a Shiny Uncommon Scroll- 2%
* Chance to pull a Shiny Common Scroll- 7%

I think I did my maths correctly...

I know this is just a cosmetic thing and would only add to collectibility, I think this addition would bring some added fun to the game, and give people a reason to buy packs of scrolls (ahem, gold sink).

Why Ancestral Totem instead of crimson bull?

Ancestral improves our matchup against order since I've been seeing alot of order players recently.

Pother is also a given against order (those pesky waking stones and spiky 2 unit) its really easy to pick off targets ;).

Transposition is nice to have but only one is needed because you can just keep 1 in ur hand and 2 seems a bit too much.


Druids Burial ground is surprisingly really effective against growth mirrors as well because it completely counters rangers bane and also does really well against a suspected quake.

Purification is vital in this deck because of the recent pot of resist hype on growth mirrors and this makes them overextend a lane while you can laugh and clean up their row!!.

Why do I not run pot of resist?
Because I found out this gives me alot more dead hands than usual although I used to double splash when Noaidi was broken.

The rest is just basic growth stuff everyone has in their decks mainly. I chose to run 2 jarls and 2 godhands for lategame

**How To Draft**

First of all, and I'll discuss those later.

You can play a draft with any number of people, and a rare. You then choose one of these cards that you may want to use in your deck. Once all 8 participants have chosen their scrolls, each participant passes their pack to the next participant (on odd rounds you pass down, on even rounds you pass up). This is automated, all you will see is 9 more scrolls to choose from. After that pick, you have 8 to choose from. This continues until each player only has one scroll left to pick from and these are essentially default picked (and they're generally bad scrolls like Faith Duty). Now everyone has picked 8 scrolls, and the process begins anew with 8 more virtual scrolls packs being distributed. This continues for 8 rounds

Now, you can't use any of them if you don't own them. Again, the draft is completely simulated, no actual scroll packs are purchased.

A tournament then follows. There's two ways to conduct this. Some people use a tournament management site like Challonge to keep track of the tournament, so that people who weren't influential over each others' picks play first. Some people prefer to match people who were closer so that the decks are less similar to one another's. It's up to preference, but I'll describe the first method. Let's say these are our participants:

* 1. John
* 2. Bob
* 3. Tim
* 4. Sarah
* 1. Alex
* 2. Sue
* 3. Zach
* 4. Joe

John would play Alex, the winner of the ""4 matchup"" will play the winner of the ""2 matchup"" and the winner of the ""3 matchup"" will play the winner of the ""1 matchup."" If there are less than 8 participants, there may be byes or even a round robin point system style tournament.

Draft tournaments can take a lot of time (as much as 1-2 hours depending)

So hopefully by now you're familiar with what draft is and how it's played. 

**Why Draft?**

Personally, and this is will definitely change in the future. But for now, I'll play a draft game anytime one is available simply because it's more fun for me. Not only is the process of quickly choosing and building decks on the fly incredibly entertaining, the games themselves are generally much more interesting and dynamic than standard games. Unplayed scrolls like Golem Skin and Shrine can suddenly win games. In short, if you love deck building and coming up with on-the-spot strategies, you will love draft.

**Draft Strategy**

All of the following will be my own opinions

* 1. Energy is the most viable faction.

Probably a statement you never thought you'd hear, your pool of playable cards is extremely limited, which means even if you get lucky enough to draft a Great Wolf you will not have as many Mangy Wolves / Ragged Wolves / Brother of the Wolfs to support him. Getting both a single Honorable General and a Speed would be considered a successful draft, however it only takes one VD or Spark+Burn or just brute force to end that. Energy scrolls just work better as single units. A Cannon Automaton (which is uncommon!) needs nothing else to make it awesome. Also, you have much fewer ""power cards"" in a draft deck. This makes removal cards such as Violent Dispersal or Burn that specifically target these power cards much more useful.

Another thing that makes Energy such a powerhouse is that structures are actually viable. Very rarely are you ever going to see a Quake

* 2. Creatures are important.

If you take a look at any standard competitive deck, you are always going to be creature starved in draft. Fertile Soil may be tempting, but a Brother of the Wolf can be a game winner. The ability to summon creatures is hugely important in draft, which is why I said drafting an Automata Forge is almost an ""I win"" condition before. Your opponent is also running less creatures than he'd like, which means he has less killing power than you'd expect. Focus on creatures when you draft, don't end up with 6 playables. 3 Bombards are nice, but not when your only ranged units are 2 Gun Automatons.

* 3. Don't underestimate unused scrolls.

Pretty straightforward. Enchantments can be good. Golem Skin + Iron Ogre has won games. A Skirmisher with a Crown of Strength is scary. A Kinfolk Brave with 3 Stag Hearts is usually gg. As I mentioned before

* 4. Consider what the people around you are drafting.

Remember, you can pretty reliably deduce what kinds of decks the people around you are playing. If someone passes you a Great Wolf they're probably not playing Growth, but if you're not seeing any good Order cards the people in front of you are probably playing Order. You can use this to your advantage by picking cards that you think will be valuable to the person you're passing to, or just denying certain factions to keep people from picking them.

* ~~Top rated redditors (iScrE4m, Syl, and so many others!) give some insight on how the meta is shifting. (this is harder to implement and, of course, I realize some of you already provide tons of insight through post, videos and streams; Please don't take this as a demand or as someone who is never satisfied ). I also know it is quite common for those guys to post what deck they have lately most used in Ranked but maybe have some insight on the theory crafting behind the deck (i.e. why run crimson over totem or vice versa).~~ Ignore this, I realize how dumb it is to ask for even more content from them. Sorry for sounding like a spoiled kid ._.'

* Noob friendly official threads: Somewhere people new to the game can get the answers for their questions without:

  A. Not being down-voted to oblivion

  B. Filling up the front page with repetitive questions that some might find trivial/uninteresting

  C. Reduce the number of repeated questions 

^(this idea comes from the ""Monday Mega-Thread"" over /r/leagueoflegends that some of you might be familiar with)

Another issue I have is the ""the down-vote issue"": I feel that here at /r/Scrolls people are really keen of the down-vote and tend to just use it as soon as they disagree with someone ([reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) disagrees). Maybe use what some other subs have done with smaller downvote buttons and a message reminding people when they should downvote).

Now

1375205759.0,1jd0pg,Ideas for new mechanics that could be implemented,ChodeyMcgee,34,12,53,"So I posted a thread about scroll ideas

So

* Tile blocking - 

Scrolls is unique in the TCG realm due to the hex board + idol + animated creatures and whatnot, this gives you time to throw down a creature or two, or find some way to defend. Conversely, if you get streamlined, the unit blocking now has 1 CD, throw a focus/stag heart/desperation (etc.) on it and now it is suddenly working to your advantage. Also, maybe roasted bean pot would be useful finally :D

* Resurrection -

This would be tough to balance obviously, but also can be avoided by killing the creature that can resurrect others or simply avoiding killing the units you need dead on certain turns.

* Possesion - 

This is one my personal favorites. Imagine a scroll or creature effect that allows you to control one of the enemy units until the end of their turn. Of course

* Scroll Search - 

This mechanic is something I think specifically only energy should have access to. Since energy is obviously not about the card draw



So there's my short list of mechanical ideas, give feedback. I'll answer any questions and discuss how to balance in the comments!

**ALSO



Edit: Forgot one. - 

* Death shielding -

Another tough to balance but interesting play/counterplay mechanic. This could be a spell or creature ability on countdown. It simply stops the creature that is enchanted from dying one time. This could be done several ways... one being that it reduces the health to 1 if it would have died. Another way could have the scroll be resummoned in metempsychosis style if it dies. In order for this to be balanced it would have to last only a single turn or cause the unit to be a lot less useful if the card had no turn limit.",self,t5_2scq0,1375206796.0,,flair-multi,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1jd0pg/ideas_for_new_mechanics_that_could_be_implemented/

1374345323.0,1ipgqr,Scrolls needs content ? No game company can compete against its customers when it comes to creating new content.,Baccata64,40,19,32,"Hey guys. 

tl;dr : Mojang should give us tools to help them create new content (art/models/animations).

There have been many posts these days about how the lack of content and features is killing the game

All of us would like more cards, and animations have to made, along with the art/the stats/the effects of the cards. These have to be implemented/debugged/polished. This takes time, and resources. 

What I'm gonna say is based on Gaben's conference that occured earlier this year, giving new models, new animations, new features, pretty much anything, and the devs who choose to roll with it are often successful.  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8QEOBgLBQU

Now, It's never been THE game everyone NEEDS to play. However, it's still alive after all these years, and slowly growing, thanks to a great community and to the ability Valve gave us to modify it and propose new content (weapons, hats, etc ...). There are people living off the selling of their TF2 hats ! Can you imagine ? 

Now, I say ""a TCG from the guys who made Minecraft"". And everybody knows that if Minecraft attracts so many players, it's because guys like you and I can make amazing stuff with it. 

http://imgur.com/r/minecraft 

See where I'm going with this ? In my opinion, and among them are tons of guys who must be talented artists, or some who have notions in animations, and graphics. Wasn't Scrolls made using Unity ? It would be great for Mojang to ask for help, and the simple opportunity (even if there's a lot of competition out there) of having our work actually incorporated to the game would be fucking great ! Any Magic player would love to design a card, even if he does not have the final word on the effect/the stats the card should have.  Mojang, please

How should this be done ? Here are the some steps : 
0. GIVE US A TOOL TO INCORPORATE MODELS/DRAWINGS/ANIMATIONS AND WATCH HOW THEY RENDER INGAME. This is just what we need to go. 
1. Give us a way to upload the art (drawings / animations / models) into a database that use and that we can see and rate as well (because our opinion counts ... think Steam Greenlight) 
2. Review our art : if it's too far from the game's aesthetics
3. If our art is selected to be incorporated in the game, could be a mention ""animations designed by *"" in the deck builder, etc"".
4. ??? 
5. PROFIT ! 

Why am I saying all this ? Because what Mojang needs to release a new set of cards is much more expensive than what the others need in terms of time and resources (due to the TBS nature of Scrolls). And Mojang does not have a huge team. I'm a Tribes : Ascend player, and because the developers do not have resources to spare to fix stuff and add new maps/guns and balance things (most devs at Hirez are now working on their Moba). But I seriously think that if they had given us an SDK from the start, it wouldn't be the same. I don't want another game I love withering like Tribes. After listening to what Gaben said, I deeply believe he is right in the fact that the future of video games business models resides on the inner ability of players to provide content. And that is what I would like Mojang to do. Please Mojang, learn things from your own success !! We players love building stuff, and we'd be more than happy to help you with Scrolls. At lease in my humble opinion. 

On top of that, the names should be submited for approval ... I wouldn't like to see an Analrapist: Kinfolk Veteran. But giving our cards identities would feel great with the stats, and would give additional value (WOW, this is the card the #3 used during the last tournament). If community-created stuff could be ""crafted"" to improve and modify the look of a unit on the board, how great would it be ?


There you go...English not being my first language, I'm 99.99% sure it would be worth it. If we want to have expansion packs of 50+ cards every few months, I can't see better ways than making the community contribute. Anyway, thanks for reading, and have a good day :) ",,False,t5_2scq0,True
1374249153.0,1imyat,Opposite to gloom and doom post,ToGoodLooking,57,37,44,"Everyone has been mentioning the potentials in the game so i do not really have to repeat that to much


So what is the issue? atm many is running around in panic afraid their game is sinking and yelling at the captain to not hit the iceberg. Allow me to take the concerns one by one and counter argue them. And yes i know many already know this or agree to this but the massive outbreak in doom prophecy lately made me want to post this.


**1:Massive drop in players.**

The game was hyped when beta opened its doors but hype only last so long. Many have left now feeling ""mhe not my thing"" or as equal many probebly are feeling so is it ""this has alot of potential and i love it, same thing when decay is released, another wave of shit ton of players will come back and after a week or so they will take a break and people will start they doom prophecy again. WoW is a entirely different beast but same concept there, people play new content, then are bored, game is ""doomed"" and new content arrives. ""It is the ciiiiiircle of gaaAAAMEEES..."".


**2:There is not enough content**

Of course there is a lack of content, if you look at minecrafts progress rate and goal so is Scrolls their third/second game much better, content alot more often and you can definitely see where this is going and they tell us what plans they have, unlike minecraft there it was pretty much dark in a month and then suddenly we had pixel wolfs for immersion or something, who knows. Here we know whisper, decay, freindlist, it just needs some time. And we usually get something new about ever second week or so


**3:There is a lack of communication from mojang**

What is it you want specifically? a Vlog? sure they could do more but do not come with that bullshit that they do very little communication. They write in twitch chat, in chats ingame, sends news about coming content and list goes on. I could probably answer your question for them that you have, with information they have given earlier that i have read.


**4:The balance being so bad**

I actually laugh at this because been in other communities for so long

Game history:

Rock-Papper-Scissor:""this is so poor game design

Growth dominance:""remove this fucking quake! this needs a fix!""

Go-Draw dominance:""FUCK THIS SHIT! HOTFIX NOW!""

Growth dominance:""like 80% of top 100 is growth this needs a fix!""

Order dominance:""omg order is so damn op this needs a fix!""

And all of this in like 4-5 weeks, mojang seem to be going a different direction with you, using things like automata forge to keep up with card draw, when you have the tool you need to make the next great strategy so can i guarantee no one will know for a good while how to deal with it and you be blamed to be op.


**5:Mojang needs to step up if they are to compete with other tcg**

Scrolls dont need 5 million players or something, yes it is in decline for the moment but that is not relevant, what is relevant is how it is when released. And why will it succeed? Because it is unique, not pay to win and will have several modes later so there will be something for most people. That is all it needs to stick out enough to have its place. This becoming a giant and takes the e-sport scene? that is not needed and not likely but who knows.


If you have more points to come with why the game is doomed then feel free to comment and i will comment back. As final note so do i wish to say that mojang has done a great job with this game, fixing noaidi, answering questions in different forums and chatting with people ingame. Even if this will be a small game so will i have allot of fun with it when they make the official release that i can guarantee, if you want to take the lifeboat then i do not mind, i be leaning back on my chair here and adding ice from the iceberg in my drink while you do that.",,False,t5_2scq0,True

1372274092.0,1h4l6t,Game Balance Concerns,derpymcgoo,41,18,33,"I think this game relies on wombo combo/alpha strike stuff too much.  It really downplays the tactical element of the game.

I think it's the main reason why Energy feels mediocre late game(Can't burn units when you never see them before they hit you) and why ridiculous counter units like Spearmen are ""balanced"" in OvG.


I don't mind if it's something that you can see before it hits you like using Blessing of Haste/Iron Whip or stuff you can defend against like Thunder Surge

Stuff like this just leaves both players with smaller scroll selection and fewer meaningful choices in game.

This game doesn't have instants like MTG so having super strong spells with essentially zero counter play(other than save up cards and do it yourself next turn) seems like a bad idea to me.

Seems like it would be better if the more ridiculous things got toned down somewhat and other cards buffed so that we get more diversity.  I mean at this point

Pretty much every solid deck that I have seen has used predictable cards and uses alpha strike/wombo combo stuff to win

You could argue that there aren't enough scrolls released to really have a lot of variety

Cards tested:

Bounce
--------
* Pushback

--------
* Brother of the Wolf
* Rat King
* Forge
* Illthorn Seed
* Bunny
* Proximity Charge

None of the tokens can be bounced with callback or pushback.  You can't even target them.  However

However

Metempsychosis can be cast on any of the tokens just fine.

I propose Callback

Callback
----------
Target non-token unit you control is returned to your hand.

Pushback
----------
Target opponent non-token unit is returned to its owner's hand

Divine Mark
-------------
When enchanted creature is destroyed

----------

That wording for divine mark might be better off as some kind of ""rulebook entry""

So here's the plan. I need you to **reply to this thread** with a few of your details so I can start setting up tournaments.

1. I need to know your in-game name.
2. I need to know your rating.
3. I need to know your total games played.
4. I need to know at what times and dates you are available to play anywhere between 6 and 9 straight matches of scrolls in GMT.

This is so I can match people together with others of similar skill level to get some real fair competition going.
 
When I have a group of 4-8 players of similar skill levels together, it is really appreciated as I can possibly begin uploading these to YouTube with commentary in later weeks.

As far as the rewards go

It costs me around 1900g-2500g to run one of these tournaments (depending on the number of players), so your donations will just help me run more tournaments.

1372010658.0,1gx2xn,Why people are against GO Draw and why Energy is deemed UP. My look at the situation,Sho7gun,28,7,61,"Ok, that's fine

Few things first though:

- My rating is around 1739 atm with mostly having played a Gravelock deck with growth splash. Now I use iScre4ms decklist though, not great in this meta. So I'm not the best player around, but I like to think I still know the game well enough to make a post like this. But like I said, this is my opinion, how I view the problem and what I think should be done about it.

- I don't view this game as in Beta, or at least a rating wipe (if people can find a source where they state that rating will be wiped, post it, because I can't find it)


Now, since yesterday really) an issue got brought up about one deck that's becoming popular in ranked plays. That deck is GO Draw. For those who want to know more about go draw, go to this link and read it: http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1837&amp;p=18276. There are now people (mostly energy players, which I will get into) who won't play in ranked because of it. 

Now, but the biggest reason is that it removes energy viability and can still beat order and growth. Is it unbeatable? Nope. But the thing is, there are only a few counters against it, and those counters were either hyper agressive decks, which dominate the higher ratings, or other GO draw decks. This deck is strong because, once it survives the early game, the decktype which really can't build a reliable agressive deck is energy. And guess which deck is deemed underpowered? Yep

Energy has a lot of strong cards and has some of the best kill spells, it's very hard for others to make a come back. It's also very good at defending. However, energy also has major weaknesses. One is the most obvious, it's early game is very slow. This weakness Mojang tried to counteract by giving us Dust Runners, which are great and a good move. Suddenly, our matchup against growth is a bit easier. However, our second weakness, is card draw. Energy only has TWO cards that draw cards. One is burn, it's only good once you're already ahead, it's also about card advantage. Even when you're behind on the board
And that's why energy is being deemd underpowered. For a game where having card advantage is so important (not just on the board but also in hand) Energy has a hard time getting that advantage. Also, pothers and kabonks, are really good because you are able to cylce through your deck to constantly have those cards in hand you need. So in my opinion, Energy needs either a new card draw card (which doesn't suck like library) or a change in library so it's far more reliable (maybe make it two turn cd) 

Now, it didn't have Noaidi. Because of that one card, GO draw has an easier time against growth and order decks (the card does almost nothing against energy, but like I said, energy already can't do much, if anything, against GO draw), as growth is dominating the ranked. That doesn't mean GO draw can easily beat growth or order now, while good players see their ratings drop because they're not playing an agressive deck (mostly energy players

But why don't people just change decks? Because a lot of people, as we find it more fun. And removing the viability of one whole colour isn't what I call good balance. And this is why a lot of people complain about this deck, even going as far as refusing to play ranked untill something is done. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I'll probably wait 'till Mojang does something to change this whole situation (and I hope it's soon). And Like I said, no, I don't see this as beta as rating doesn't get reset (unless someone proves me otherwise). 
There are situations where you can wait and see

Edit: It seems they removed the ability for Noaidi to get growth

I am introducing my new tournament series so it's not a one time thing. It's more like a ladder tournament every 2 weeks. The system is kinda different so don't get scared off. Read about it

Usually you guys participating on tournaments which are finished in one day based on a KO-System. This takes a lot of time and leads to frustration since it's only 1 game in the lower brackets, we are starting on **Monday ( 19.08.2013 6pm CET )** and playing the ""[Swiss-System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)"" it means I am creating the bracket every day at 6pm based on the last results. The moment the new bracket is live you have 22 hours ( 4pm the next day ) to provide a result ( 1-0, 2-0, 2-1 ). If I don't get the results in time I will tie the game. Within the first 3 hours after the bracket is live each player have to get in contact with his opponent to set up a date. If someone is refusing to contact his opponent right in time it's going to be a free win for him. These scenarios are all worst case the goal is a clean tournament flow without any trouble. So if there is someone making to much trouble, bad attitude, making people feel uncomfortable e.t.c, I don't hesitate to disqualify him instantly. So these is the summary of the whole system. I am going into details now.

__________________________________

**Start:** [19.08.2013 - 6.00 PM CET](http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/eu/cet.html)

**End:** [28.08.2013 - 6.00PM CET](http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/eu/cet.html)

**Entry Fee:** 1.500 Gold

**How to sign up:** Add me ingame ""Heimerdinger"" and transfer me 1.500 gold

So these are the basic rules. Within the next 3 days I am coming up with some additional rules to guarantee a nice tournament experience for everyone. It was important for me to have 22 hours timetable for one Bo3 game, so it's not that hard to find a date for the match.

You guys can bring up your own ideas or offer me help to organize it. Every match-day at 6.00 pm CET I am going to create a new reddit post with the updated bracket and at the end of the day I try to list up all replays in this post. **No matter which kind of rules / changes we add

If the whole thing works well we make this every 9 days with a 2 days break between it.

When playing with / against growth and energy the matches always feel really tense all the way through. When playing against order though you need to rush them like crazy as once they get to the late game and can play a few imperials it's GG. 

Since order have lots of crazy card combos they can just mass cards with 10-15 in hand at once. It then becomes impossible for either growth or energy to keep up as even if you do fair trades they can just keep playing more beefy units and combos.

I think it's clear to most that the game is in a bad state currently. I've only been playing for about 3 weeks

* Decline in the number of active players ([Drachenlord's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1i6o26/sub_10k_in_last_24_hours_whats_the_deal/))

* Most recently

Of those the last one is **really** worrisome, as I do enjoy CCG games a lot).

I'd still like Scrolls to do well

* The game itself has a lot of potential and is fun. Coming from a Magic background
* Unfortunately, although some silly issues like frequent disconnects contribute to it as well. I realize it is still in *beta*, but please see my comments below regarding *beta* status.
* Mojang is not reacting to the problems in the right way at all. The common excuse seems to be that the developers are away on vacation
* The game is going to face stiff competition from the up and coming online CCGs
* Scrolls could still prevail

Word of mouth on this game has changed from ""you need to check out this awesome new CCG from the Minecraft guys"" to ""Scrolls is pretty stagnant

So what is needed to try and salvage the situation:

* A massive amount of material and communication from Mojang. They really need to look at companies like Riot and Wizards of the Coast to understand what is required here. Perhaps something like Mark Rosewater's old weekly design posts just to let the community know something is happening.
* Lots and lots of content
* Get out of beta

I know this *advice* is pretty obvious, it is too late, and the best they can do now is hope to hit really strongly six months from now.** 

Decay won't make me come back to Scrolls, hold on to the die-hard fan base (which will be very small for the foreseeable future) and make a big buzz about the actual non-beta release. Even then I feel like it will be an uphill battle.

Lastly a short note about the crutch that is *beta* status. I bought this game without even realizing it was still in *beta* (it's not that clear on their website). The concept of *beta* has certainly evolved, pay for, product *beta*. While perhaps technically correct, all I can say as a player is ""I don't care."" I paid for something which is of poor quality and as such I won't be playing it again until it proves, not that it has the potential to be good, but that it is actually good.",,self,,

Currently in the beta we've seen a 'scroll trickle' where a few new scrolls get added every 3 weeks or so. Scrolls is unique in this regard as this isn't really possible with tabletop card games. One downside about this method is that the meta game could shift instantly whenever a new scroll is added (as we saw with Noaidi) which would disrupt competitive play.

Another option would be expansions where a ton of new scrolls are released at once but the wait between expansions is longer. This would give us a lot of new deck options to play with at once

Which method would you prefer: the trickle, or something completely different?",,False,self,t5_2scq0,False,,
1374086720.0,1ii4sd,How can Energy be fixed?,Relentless_Pain,30,9,79,"  Right now energy is looking to be weakest of the 3 resources ( Rank Leader board backs this up + tournament results) and I am just wondering how it could be improved.

  IMO Thunder Surge needs a complete buff/reworking. The card does 2 damage to all connected units for 6 energy. It can be played around so easily and 2 damage isn't that much of a punish for connecting your units. Quake is better in almost every way except it effects your side as well and Speed + Mangonel does 3 damage to a diamond area and for 1 more order can be made to do 6 damage. Either Thunder surge needs to do more damage or lose the connecting needed for it to be good because atm you are almost better playing 2 IB's instead of using 1 Thunder Surge.

I also think cards like Ether pump and charge coil need to be able to be buffed so they can be some what useful. 1 Damage is not that important (especially vs order where most have 4+ Health) ",self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-energy,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ii4sd/how_can_energy_be_fixed/
1373986164.0,1iez7k,The ELO / Rating system needs to be fixed,Reiker0,25,7,30,"There's currently a huge problem with the rating system right now that is extremely detrimental to the game. There are much less 1900+ players playing ranked lately. This makes it much more difficult for people to climb the ladder, to climb right now you need to win approximately 4+ games for every 1

So we have a bit of a perpetual problem. High ranked players won't play ranked because they don't want to lose lots of rating to a low ranked player and mid-to-high ranked players don't want to play ranked because there's no higher ranked players to play against.

I think most 1800+ players are aware of this problem. I was watching a stream last night where a 1900ish player got matched against a 1500 player

The rating system itself should probably be adjusted. You should never receive -1 or +0 for winning a match

I think the above idea is pretty solid. However, you lose some rating. 30 was the proposed number, which may seem like a lot but if it was something like 5 or 10, I feel that most high ranked players would just accept it instead of risking -25 from a ranked match. The point is to make the possibility of rating decay a worse option than potentially losing a ranked match, to get people away from sitting at the top of the ladder and into playing ranked more.

I've been putting a lot of work into community building on twitch and I honestly believe scrolls viewers to be the nicest community I've ever seen on twitch. Please feel free to stop by and interact with either myself or my chat. 

I'm preparing a huge ""State of the Game"" article which I'll be writing next week as I travel around california doing job interviews. So for the time being I'll refrain from talking about scrolls.

Besides of course!
- 2 pm PDT each Sunday. 
- 1000 gold entry fee (this isn't set in stone). 
- Prizes down to top 4 or top 8 depending on the amount of entrants. 
- All entry fees are given as prizes
- Registration will be rolling per week
-The tournament will be single elimination Bo3s (or possibly Bo1 double elim depending on interest).

I restream participant's matches while handling logistics and provide commentary to both entertain non-participating viewers and to provide feedback that participators can review in my VODs

I hosted a tournament last Sunday with 26 entrants and Light as our winner raking in 6k gold (tourny was only 500g entry).

I'm aware that in the game it says you're guaranteed to get 2 uncommon and 1 rare in the 10 card packs and there was a dev confirmation that the probability split among random cards was 70%/20%/10% c/u/r.

My question is in the 10 card packs is it that you're guaranteed to get **exactly** 7/2/1 or **at least** 7/2/1? Can the common cards randomly be better or are you always guaranteed to get exactly the average distribution when you buy in bulk?

My suggestion is that there need to be some types of gold sinks in Scrolls to prevent gold from pouring in and packs from being bought and the cards in ""circulation"" continue to rise and decrease in value. This is something I feel strongly about and is related to tournaments but in the end there needs to be much more than that.

I see a tournament option and its greyed out obviously suggesting that tournament modes are in the works so my suggestion for a gold sink/tournament is a draft mode. This is not going to be THE gold sink to fix the gold problem altogether but as long as they balance the cost players pay in as more than what they are giving out it will help in the long run.

For those of you who does not know what a draft mode is, play each other, get prizes (more packs), and keep all the cards. The winners got boosters and usually there were varying modes, such as single elimination (one loss and you are out) where the top winners got all the extra packs or a swiss (where everyone plays 3 rounds) and those with the most wins get more packs than those under but usually only the person who lost all 3 rounds gets nothing.

This mode would have an increased fee (above what the packs themselves cost + the prizes given out) to join due. This is my favorite type of tournament (in MTG) and I look forward to it in scrolls if the devs could work it out with a good deck size/number of packs/prizes and fees. I'm sure regular tournaments will also be in there where you bring your deck already made and play and the best get prizes but I love playing with decks you make on the spot.

 

If you are an MTG player

Someone in the thread on the forums also suggested sealed events as well which i stand behind as well. It would be a little harder with sealed because you don't get to pick all the X color or faction from many packs but it could still be tons of fun with the right deck size and number of packs.",self,t5_2scq0,False,,flair-energy,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1fw5lo/gold_sinkstournamentsdrafting/

1372970866.0,1hnkgq,Spiky rules.txt clarity and Mechanics Guide (A Spearman and a Wildling walk into a bar...),popostee,20,4,15,"Hi all

Had this experience today with a Ducal Spearman and a Wildling.

Currently
&gt;""When Ducal Spearman is damaged in combat

In my mind, since the Wildling *did* do damage, that damage was just 0. But I think perhaps the wording should be changed to:
&gt;""When Ducal Spearman is attacked
for clarity. Or maybe this is not working as intended. 

In any case, especially in the context of testing whether those interactions are properly functioning; this is a beta test, after all! As another example, in my experience with Mangy Wolfs and spiky units, an attacking Mangy Wolf with 3 health survives with only one health, while a Mangy Wolf with 2 health dies when attacking, so the Mangy Wolf's heal is neither applied before, or after the attack. Is this working as intended

To be useful
*How precedence is determined when an ability interacts with other abilities.
*The actual source of the ability (eg. the dustrunner/efficiency dilemma)
*Any oddities which are not immediately clear from the text of the ability.
*Examples of the ability's function in normal and odd cases.

And
*Basic mechanics (countdown, 3 card max, etc.)
*Advanced mechanics (real health is removed before temporary health
*How disconnects are handled
*How the no-discard-pile works

Such documentation would help introduce new players to the game and, even a community-created archive of various rules and mechanics experiments would be helpful in the interim.

**TL;DR:**Spiky does damage even if no damage is done to spiky unit and we need a resource which clearly explains the complexities of game rules.

1372447734.0,1h9mrf,Special Rules Tournament (No Rares),Kittsy,21,3,12,"***FULL***

Scrollsguide link: http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=2042

**Intro:**

My favourite thing about card games is making new Decks and showing your understanding of the game by being able to value cards whenever something in the game changes. This doesn't work as well when people can just copy the top Decks. I'm going to be hosting a series of tournaments with special Deck building rules that mean you have to re-evaluate each card and show that you really understand the mechanics. 

**Prizes:**

1st: 2000g
2nd: 1000g
3rd: 500g

**Rules:**

***Special rule: No rares***

Once the brackets are up, and I can identify one player as the reason for the match failing to happen (example: One player has been on constantly, waiting for the match, and the other has not been on at all), that player will be given a match loss. If not, both players will be disqualified and anyone who would have faced them in a later bracket will be given an automatic win. A replay of each game should be provided by the winner to prove the result.

The tournament is double-elimination

You do not have to submit a Deck-list

I had a few ideas that might help new players a bit when starting out. Some of these could already be in the works. 

1. Specialize the Tutorial to your precon.

If you start out as order, you can play it again as the other precons to learn their basic strategies, see their scrolls, etc). 
(perhaps if you want to go farther, you're given the option to stay with energy or choose one of the other two precons and play test them). 

2. Did Not Sacrifice Notification in the tutorial only.

I remember another player posting how it would be helpful for newbies to get a notification before ending their turn for so many ranks. Personally I don't think that players that opt out of ranked matches should always be treated as newbies

3. Weekly Trials

Especially if you play order and got some cards of other colors to trade

---

- ALLCAPS IS BAD. Repeating more than 2x per minute is bad.

- Dont waste anyones time trading or browsing too much. Dont go into trades if you dont have a clear simple deal in mind or have a lot of gold to spend to add flexibility.

- Just join ""trading-2"" and ""trading-3"" and read the SELLING offers for 5 minutes. Please ignore the buying offers that are usually 75% of selling offers. A selling offer is barely ever a rip-off while a buying offer is sometimes put very low. After 5 minutes you are likely having a general updated idea of the most wanted and most traded card prices. i wont mention those here

- You can open the chat window and have the deck builder open to search for names if you think you have a wanted card.

- it makes much more sense to just say what cards you have to offer (without a gold price in mind

- Order is the least played faction

- Common order cards sell for as little as 65 gold

- The ability to chose a card does not cost extra. The price of a card is mostly set by popularity and demand. Most players buy random cards for 100 or 175 each. most players play growth and likely bought random growth cards.

- Common growth cards sell for 50-110 gold. Because everyone has some of them and some cards are just not bough by anyone as much yet.

- Having the same card 4x is useless to anyone. Any 4th or even more card of the same type indicates that no one wanted to buy this card for a long time

---

Why some cards most popular to be traded for a lot of gold instead of being valued less than 200:

- Kinfolk brave 1000-1600 - Because its a rare growth card that only costs 2 energy. This card is weak but its flexible and can cause a fast win or a risk a slow loss. Valuable for AI matches. Expect its value to rise for a while.

- Great wolf 600-1500 - because most players play growth with a wolf deck and its unlikely to change anytime soon. Do not trade this card too cheaply. 1500 is a reasonable price

- Kinfolk Jarl 500-800 - because its a rare expensive growth card

- Speed 900-1100 - (I have no personal experience with this one

- God hand 700-1100 - I have not much experience with this card. but its a CARD NAME and its a popular rare one whats still not easy to trade

- Quake 800-1000 - rare card that does lots of damage to a horde of unbuffed units. This is a ward against wolf decks with rising demand.

- Honorable general - 650-750 - the only expensive Order-card. this is what it sells for. so dont trade it 1:1 for one of the upper cards. Thats unlikely a fair trade.

- Waking Stones - 500-650 - similar to Honorable general

- Wildling 400-500 - Growth card that allows for some specialized PvP  decks with lots of buffs. Dont sell it cheap

- Bombard 400-500 - Its rare but a specialized energy deck card. low demand decreased its value but its easily worth more to someone who has already 2 bombard cards and such a specialized deck. Expect falling prices.

1370410989.0,1fpefd,Tips from a seasoned MTG player adapting to Scrolls,,16,0,7,"As the title would suggest

So here are my tips

**1. Scrolls is not MTG; don't get frustrated when you fail.** It can be quite annoying and humbling coming from MTG and doing rather poorly in Scrolls; especially to someone (like the Easy AI) who 'plays like a newb'. Remember

**2. Do not hold on to scrolls in your hand unnecessarily,"" but don't do it. What you need this turn can very well be the last thing you need next turn.

**3. Everything is played at sorcery speed.** Yes, once it is the opponent's turn you are not allowed to act. This related to the second tip in that you should not hold on to control cards ""just in case"" (see tip #4 as well).

**4. Stop worrying about the graveyard.** The graveyard is recycled back into the deck you draw from automatically (and behind the scenes). Your creatures keep dying? You keep casting your 'good' spells? Feel uneasy discarding your 'awesome guy' for mana? Hate to discard that boomerang that you *know* you'll need just for two scrolls? Quit worrying. All of those scrolls will be reshuffled back into your library at some point and you'll see them again. Play what you need to play for the turn. Discard freely for mana/scrolls.

**5. Don't get cozy with your mana (resource) pool.** So you got 5, but don't stop discarding for additional resources yet. The battlefield can change quickly and many times you will have to play several creatures/spells in a single turn to gain the advantage again or simply stay alive. Shorting yourself because you 'had enough' mana before will only cause you to lose when battles get dragged out.

**6. Don't immediately play what you draw out of desperation or excitement.** You may be in a pinch and you draw a scroll that you know is going to help a good bit. Or maybe it's your favorite 'awesome guy' scroll. Think carefully before playing it, I'd recommend discarding it for two more. I'd be willing to say 80% of the time the two you draw are better together than the single one you drew at first. Even if only one of the two you draw is good, you have a spare to discard next turn to prevent being faced with the same dilemma again. Now if both are good, do play them and repeat the discard procedure (see tip #4). If you have bad luck with this, it's probably more to do with your deck lacking consistency rather than your streak of luck.

**7. There is no sideboard so make sure your deck has some situational scrolls.** While there is no sideboarding, don't overdue it and water down your deck with every possible scenario. There's no reason a deck should not have some removal, burn, control, or prevention if your type has it.

**8. Build cohesive decks and keep your scroll count low.** Unless you're building a 'funny deck'

**9. Avoid 'multi-colored' decks until later.** I know it may be tempting once you get some of the scrolls and detect the synergy between Order, the playstyle, and a good scroll library built up first. 

**10. Utilize the benefits of your deck type.** Each type (Order, a few human units for Order will give attack/defense bonuses to the entire row of friendly units. They also have several units that are 'spiky' and make great front-line defenders. Between those two aspects, you can tell formations are very important and moving around is key in an Order-based deck.

**11. Never gauge your deck's performance against the Trial matches.** Trust me, don't do a Trial.

**12. Use the trade channel.** At the heart of it all, or simply just as a social thing -- do it. From my interactions it has been quite pleasurable. It's very easy to find what you are looking for and just as easy to trade away what others are seeking. Don't be afraid to trade using gold if nothing interests you or them, it's the only way to buy new random cards/packs.

**13. Sometimes, having access to the uncommon and rare scrolls doesn't hurt. The starter decks do a pretty good job of giving you a place to begin, but there is always room for improvement. Also, having multiples of the more rare scrolls helps draw consistently. Fortunately, this phase doesn't last too long once you start buying additional ones and trading around for the ones you need. This is another reason I mention tip #9 early out.

Please remember that these are tips or 'loose rules'

1375019884.0,1j7qw9,Since we're sharing our ideas for new scrolls today...,Reiker0,23,8,27,"Here are a few scrolls I've come up with. RES highly recommended to view this. I have some more ideas

[Magic Well](http://i.imgur.com/Jt6Mu83.png)

Pretty basic. We have a scroll that summons a creature for 1G and a scroll that summons a structure for 1O

[Bladegunner](http://i.imgur.com/jshniUl.png)

First of 3 creatures that appear in the Energy wallpaper that don't have a card. 

[Grenadier](http://i.imgur.com/LMs47sM.png)

I originally made her quite similar to the Storm Runner, and I already have plans for a counter card called Purge (1O).

She may be too powerful like this

[Machine Mage](http://i.imgur.com/AsKqTYn.png)

The offensive compliment to Machine Priest. I like this thing a lot. Not much more to say about it.

[Gale Runner](http://i.imgur.com/iAliFdF.png)

I came up with this before the Viscera Sage scroll was known about

[Overheat](http://i.imgur.com/yCbXGx6.png)

This was supposed to be a complimentary card to Gale Runner to assist with Energy's ramp, however. This should probably add some Attack to the structure as well.

[Death Ray](http://i.imgur.com/8GuH5Ge.png)

I simply made this because I thought the concept was really cool and totally fit the theme of Energy. Again, so it can be countered. Also you can potentially get better trades with it, but it's very counterable (kill it before it goes off or move out of the lane). It's removal and board control all in one, so it fits well with Energy regardless of its viability.

[Oathsworn](http://i.imgur.com/SJMtMRN.png)

Fairly self-explanatory.

[Wartime Conscription](http://i.imgur.com/hDHfOpb.png)

This came about me trying to come up with a clever Order-themed ""comeback card"" that's not Mangonel (btw, to essentially counter mass removal such as Quake or Necrogeddon. Maybe it's not needed, but it seems like the other factions all have some sort of ""oh crap, this is going badly for me, let me play this card that gets me back in the game.""

[Knight Crusader](http://i.imgur.com/0Fn7tId.png)

So, this is a card that does things. I like the powerful Order creatures that affect other creatures around them, so I made this.


That's all I have in card form right now. I'm also considering a scroll called Reckoning that costs 7O and gives all friendly creatures Slayer until end of turn. It would essentially be Order's God Hand but would probably also require a General - Speed combo and it would be more of a board clear than God Hand's game finisher.",self,t5_2scq0,1375021467.0,,flair-multi,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1j7qw9/since_were_sharing_our_ideas_for_new_scrolls_today/

Cut to Scrolls being released. I figure cool- I trust Mojang, I'm not sure how I feel about this. I like the gameplay style better, feels a a little more like a war/board game with the additional positions, little pieces, gaining resources requires sacrifice, etc. but I feel like I'm more or less stuck with my starter deck as I try to slog through the single player trials, which I don't know maybe I am just awful at this game but they seem quite hard with just the (Growth) starter deck and the few cards I've been able to purchase. I've beaten the Easy missions and it's feeling like the cards I have are not going to let me progress any farther.

**Basically I feel like I got similar amounts of time with DoC and Scrolls where I reached the ""my cards aren't good enough, I've already spent real money.**

I'll stick with Scrolls since I'm obviously already invested at least somewhat, etc but as a newbie I haven't felt a lot of the satisfaction that you want to feel a little ways in that makes you feel like you've made some progress from where you started.

That said

**Am I just awful at Scrolls or has anyone else experienced this?**

edit: Boldness for the TL;DR crowd

update: Just spent the 2000g given in today's patch to buy up in-faction single scrolls. Huge difference. Deck is getting more consistent and therefore more fun to play because I feel like winning has to do with my deck composition and not just the luck of the draw (as much).

Now, he drew that Speed RIGHT when he needed it to sweep the board...you know?  

http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1kg35p/has_anyone_confirmed_whether_or_not_the_ai/cbowiyd

The AI doesn't cheat.  It just operates intelligently with what's available.  So why does it feel like it does?  Inherent distrust of computer systems built into the psyche?  

Maybe

The computer doesn't look like it takes time to *think*.  As players, then make another move.  It's how the human mind operates.  The computer plans all of its moves on a given turn ahead of time, then makes them all at once.  It may take it 10 seconds to make those plans (especially when the board is full) but once it starts moving, it all happens very quickly.  

That produces the sensation that the computer isn't reacting to changing situations, where the AI would instantly make another move when given a second turn, rather than digging around the board like the player was forced to.

I'd like to see a small gold reward for players during downtime. This would help players that don't play often still earn gold for cards. For example, up to a maximum of 200% after 100 hours. This percentage would be applied as a bonus to the gold earned from the next *winning* game the person plays.

For example, I'd also get a down time bonus of 96, for a total of 296 gold. My ""bonus gold"" bar would then be reset to zero. This bonus would not start rising until I had not played a game for a hour.

**Idea 1:**

- *Flying cards:*  Owls, you name it.  What does the flying trait do?  Make you immune to any ground based spells and tile effects.  Which bring us to 2 and 3.


**Idea 2:**

- *Ground Effect:*  Tack this onto cards where it makes sense such as binding roots and quake and other effects that shouldn't logically affect flying creatures.


**Idea 3:**

- *Tile effects:*  This idea came mostly from posting a Fire Deck Idea in one of the other posts.  Basically Tile effects are effects that stay on the board for a certain number of turns that only affect an enemy while on that tile.  This could be used for zone control and could even have charges.  

Possible cards could include cards that add a sticky substance that prevents a player from moving for a turn when they move onto the spot and gets used up, tiles that increase max cooldown while on it, etc.


**Idea 4:**

- *Burn Effect:*  This came from my fire deck idea

I've been working on a really fun Energy/Order deck and two scrolls that have really helped me keep the deck running smoothly are [](#heritage) and *Clock Library*. It's even more fun to combine these two and draw **five** cards when it hits zero countdown. Even if destroyed prematurely that's at least **two** cards.
  
In my Order deck I really like *Divine Mark* which I rarely see played as well. It doubles as a save for your unit and an attack negation, how can you beat that?
  
Another is [](#powerbound) which I see used occasionally in mono-Order decks but I think it really shines in decks where Order is not the main faction. In my combo deck it really helps me ramp up Order without it getting in the way of my hand-sacrificing decision. Again

1376419979.0,1kangi,Decay Deck Theorycrafting / Discussion,Reiker0,16,2,18,"Since the devs have stated that they feel Decay is fairly balanced and we'll be seeing it on the main server soon

Here are the cards I feel every Decay deck will run:

* 3x Brain Lice
* 3x Damning Curse
* 3x Ilmire Hunter
* 3x Ilmire Rot Eat
* 3x Ilmire Witch Doctor
* 3x Infectious Blight
* 3x Languid
* 3x Lumbering Muckhead
* 3x Oblivion Seeker

I'm sure some people will probably disagree with those cards being must-haves, and removal. This leaves 27 cards to round out a deck (a couple other cards like Blightbearer will probably be in 90%+ of decks as well but I omitted them from this list because I could see some people not playing them).

From here I feel there's three ways that Decay can go:

**Standard**

[Mock-up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6933)

I call this standard because it functions most closely to the current competitive decks we have now. It's very creature heavy. Your goal here is to essentially play normally. You play creatures when you can to kill your opponent's creatures and keep board control. Tethered Recruit could potentially be replaced here

**Poison**

[Mock-up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6904)

This deck includes Mangy Rat, and it will require some attention to make sure the Blight stays active on your opponent's board. This deck does not contain the Puppet Soldier / Nutrition combo, which may be a mistake, but the exclusion of Soldier and inclusion of Summons effectively means you have 6 Miasma Wells in your deck to make up for how vulnerable and necessary they are for this deck to function. Infected Gravelocks are a possibility for additional poison damage, but I don't feel they're viable unless Mojang changes their Move 0. It's just way too easy for your opponent to play around them currently. If you do decide to use Infected Gravelocks, I'd recommend also running 3 Transpositions for surprise attacks. Pestis could also actually work in this deck as well. Even under the worst conditions (Pestis unit dies immediately) you gain 1 Mangy Rat for 3 Decay as long as you play it when you're about to kill something.

I'm really interested in seeing how this deck will do after watching Blinky vs. Rastien's 60+ round game. Blinky was playing Order and was winning the game, but the games will probably be the longest of any Decay deck type. It will also most likely have trouble in the Decay vs. Decay match-up, unless Miasma Wells are changed to only affect your own poison. Otherwise, this style of play could backfire on you quickly.

**Direct Idol Damage**

[Mock Up](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6936)

Probably the most interesting deck type of them all. I also had to contradict my ""must play Decay card"" list and remove Brain Lice and 1 Infectious Blight to fit everything here. Once again, and this time it's Totem of Suffering. This deck has a little less removal / control than the others, so you do risk your opponent just running away with the game. The objective here is to keep as many Totems of Suffering alive as possible. Whenever your creatures die, that's 1 idol damage for every Totem you possess. Every Loyal Darkling you play on the board is guaranteed to do at least 3 direct idol damage as long as you have just one Totem in play. Get all 3 Totems on the board and now each Loyal Darkling does 5 direct idol damage. Also consider I'm running Soul Steal here, so a Loyal Darkling + Soul Steal can deal 5 damage to an idol, and then summon another weak creature that can be subsequently killed for even more idol damage. There are some really interesting possibilities here, and it'll all be about toeing the balance between letting your opponent kill your things but not letting them just overpower you completely. Hex Marks could be played for more idol damage potential, and could ensure a win. The possibilities of playing Necrogeddon with 3 Totems of Suffering on the field to just insta-win games is a bit mind blowing.

Neither of those work out to 300+ gold for a winning game though. If I win a game (m=20 and 20i = 60) that took approximately 20 minutes (t=1.5)

1375010549.0,1j7lyb,We would see more true multicolor decks if scrolls cost would be partially colorless.,KungfuDojo,21,11,31,"Right now there are only pure scrolls for each color. Some decks splash a second color for 1 drop spells (often order) and there are some draw/ramp decks that can actually works with multiple colors but it ends here.

**The reason (you can skip this if you want):**

For each resource you more or less have to sacrifice scrolls effectively putting you at a scroll disadvantage. With 6 resources of a color you can play nearly every card of your deck already if it is monocolored. If you have a 2 colored deck and want to play only 5 cost cards of both colors you have to actually sacrifice 10 cards already to play your whole deck and you still might get screwed if you draw the wrong scrolls and don't have the relevant resources yet. It is a double disadvantage and thus not viable. The only effects that currently support multicolored decks a bit more are resource gainers but in the end those still will cost you scrolls or atleast slow you down hard. With the current system it will NEVER be viable to do a complete 50/50 split into 2 colors unless there are some ridiculous combo cards available.

**The possible change:**

What if instead of 5 resources of a kind scrolls would cost 2x+3 for example (2 resources of a kind + 3 times any resource)? It would instantly increase deck variety by a huge amount. I don't see a reason not to do this (beside having to put a lot of reworking into the existing cards but hey .. it is still beta). There still could be true monodeck scrolls that cost 5x etc because they are supposed to be very limited to a specific color.

**Discussion:**

You could say this change would make Scrolls more similiar to traditional TCGs like MTG but let's face the truth. There is a reason they chose this superior resource system there and in many games. Right now deck variety is very limited in terms of multicolor choices which isn't exactly a small problem given there are only 3 (4) different colors out yet. It is still not too late to do this massive change and I'd say better now than never.

So what is your opinion? For me lack of deck variety is the #1 reason why I don't play this game more than I do. I always come back to try new stuff just to see that the actually good decks can be counted on one hand.",self,t5_2scq0,1375011634.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1j7lyb/we_would_see_more_true_multicolor_decks_if/

**What is Scrolls Ladder League?**

Scrolls Ladder League is a league that consists seasons that last 2 weeks long. It is made up of multiple ladders(or divisions)

The ultimate goal is work your way up the Ladders and to win Ladder 1. Winning Ladder 1 makes you that particular season's Grand Champion.

At this time, are being considered. Season 1 we're looking to make there be a 100g entry fee per player. Does that sound okay? You would pay the entry fee to me(Pizzarony In-Game) before the Season began.

**How an Example Season Would Go:**

Pizzarony, NoScopexX420Xx and GruntMan111 are in Ladder 1. They all play 2 games against each other(may change depending on # of participants). Pizzarony ends up with a perfect 6-0 Record. BillyBob comes in second place with a 4-2 record. NoScope finishes 2-4. And GruntMan finishes 0-6. Pizzarony, in this case, would be the Grand Champion, or winner of the League's top Ladder. But say if these were results for Ladder 2, Pizzarony would then move up to Ladder 1, while BillyBob and NoScope remain in Ladder 2

Make sense? Good. (If you need further explanation

Sign-Ups for Season 1 of the Scrolls Ladder League are open now! Please visit [THIS LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/ScrollsLL/comments/1gdo66/officialscrolls_ladder_league_season_1_signup/) to sign up.

since everyone says Energy is underpowered or weak I decided to make a small Energy guide with some handy advices.

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#4903
This is a ranged Energy deck im running at the moment at ~1700 rating.

The main strategy behind energy is to use your spellcards such as Spark, Thunder Surge or Blind Rage (sometimes also Iron Whip) to constantly clear your opponents board.

Use your structures to protect your creatures. Put important structures in the edges of your board

Your creatures are very strong, Bombard or Iron Whip to clear his board (&lt;- clearing enemies board is very important, so you can control the game) and eventually kill his idols. Bombard + Concentrate Fire is a nice combo to surprisingly kill an idol with a Cannon Automaton. Iron Whip or Fury is a nice combo with Copper Automaton, since it attacks in the same turn you summon it.

Stall the game in the early phases with structures and cheap units like Gun Automaton and Scattergunner. Sacrifice Cooldownreduction spells or Concentrate Fire in the early stages of the game, Copper + Ironwhip for example, but never do a 3 for 1. When you have enough Energy you can eventually make plays with your strong units and Bombard/Fury/Concentrate fire.
Also watch high rating Energy players like Sysp (http://www.scrollsguide.com/replays) and practice this strategy alot and you will have more and more fun with your Energy deck. :)",self,t5_2scq0,1373249015.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1hsr7l/energy_some_advices_for_new_player/

MtG: Duels of the Planeswalkers. I hated this game. I know MtG is the big daddy that started it all, but on the computer it was a total snooze fest and I couldn't stand all the timer countdowns and interruptions and having to constantly hit ""continue"".

MM: Duel of Champions. Thought this was the most aesthetically pleasing game visually and aurally with the exception of having cards instead of pieces.

As it stands, I was only entertained for a few days and found it tough to follow all the different cards being played, and mainly because they are all flat and lifeless.

Scrolls. The Burger King-esque color scheme is a bit of a turn off. I think I get the reasoning for it... coloring everything in the same fashion of weathered scrolls, having those scrolls come to life really makes such a difference to me in following the action and making the game exciting. The game may still need some balancing but for the most part my matches have been very competitive. Oh and finding matches... so painless. Love the simple interface and even though I wish there was a grid like placeholder system for the Deck Builder, I still found the Scrolls Deck builder the easiest to use, even if it can become a cluttered mess. I also feel a much better monetization system is in place with Scrolls than the MM game. Whatever pay to win aspect is in there, it is so minor that it is practically non-existent. I've acquired all the scrolls I wanted for my build without spending extra money or trading for scrolls.

For each color 40 out of the 50 cards will be the same 95% of the time. This is what kills this game for me and should be number 1 priority to change. Why even allow mixing colors when only going 3 resources into a splash is nearly impossible to justify cost wise? Decay might imrpove the situation but why cant we splash more even now with the 3 existing colors?

Changing this should be number 1 priority even if it means completly reworking the current balancing.

I am going to be doing a pilot for a weekly show ""Table Talk"".  The purpose of the show is to have new players come and talk about building a deck.  We will help by providing feedback on strengths and weakness of the deck.  We want to help players build the deck by helping provide cards they can't get. 

This is not a free card service but more of a discussion on META and helping with new ideas.  We would like to then play test your deck on stream and further analyze it.  

Lets us know what ideas you have for a deck and lets see if we can make it playable.  

**GOALS FOR THE SHOW**

* share info on META 
* get people some cards 
* to try new strats and see if we can make them viable.

Do they:

A) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find the topmost valid scroll in the discard pile (most recently put there).

B) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find the bottommost valid scroll in the discard pile (least recently put there).

C) Causes your deck to be shuffled and the topmost valid scroll is selected.

Sorry if this has already been covered but I couldn't find any information on it.

EDIT:

So I did some testing because I don't know if anyone actually knows the answer to this. I made a 50 card deck with all unique cards including 4 structures
On the first test I discarded all my structures and used summons which brought back the most recently discarded structure and did not shuffle my deck which seemed to indicate A) is how fetches work. 
However when I tested this again it brought back a structure that was the second most recently discarded so this leads to:

D) If there is no valid scroll left in the deck it will find a random valid scroll in the discard pile (most recently put there).

About the only way I can get an attack in is if I use speed on the same round as I put down the creature, and you can only do that so many times before you run out of speed cards.

Firstly the Scrolls game server is located at: **54.208.22.193** on port **8081**.
You can log into the game by sending the following JSON message:

**{ ""msg"":""SignIn""


You need to encrypt your email and password using RSA and the public modulus and exponent from the game.
I was able to achieve this by using the following code:

Once sent

Once logged in

**{ ""msg"" : ""CardTypes"" }**

This returns a very long list of every card in the game:

The connection automatically closes to the server if it doesn't receive a 'ping' message every 10 seconds:

I know we are all eagerly awaiting the new content which seems so close yet so far
 Mojang have done amazing things over the past four weeks. The [community demanded more](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1ifdaz/how_do_we_tell_mojang_that_we_need_more/) community features, and Mojang have responded in delivering just that. 

The test server is a great tool for ironing out bugs and balance much more quickly and practically than in the main client. The key difference between it and the client


I think people are so keen on all the new content that they forget about all the inevitable negatives that would come with the elimination of the test server:

* More Bugs.

* An increase in server down time.

* An imbalance of cards.

* It would take longer to balance since on the test server you get every scroll where as you would have to buy them on the main client (scroll rarity may come into factor).

* People would QQ if a card was removed or drastically changed.

* Summoner Mods may cease to work more frequently due to client changes.

* Modders may be discouraged to pursue work on a mod by the constant client changes.


Positives:

* Getting new content faster.

My opinion is that test servers are a privilege

With a buttload of new content on the horizon let’s all just hold in our scrollual frustration for a bit longer or just go blow your load over another CCG while you wait.

TLDR: Elimination of the test server is a bad idea IMO

1375846427.0,1juz0r,Deck Idea : Necrovore (monoD),andimjustsittinghere,11,3,14,"Below is a copy of [the post I made over at Scrollsguide](http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=2548&amp;p=24159#p24159). I'm hoping to get some more feedback from y'all Redditors.

This is a deck based on [the new Necrogeddon](http://www.scrollsguide.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2537) and the announcement made by MansOlson that Animovore does/will work on structures and not just creatures (linked thread

**Central combos**

*Scavenger Construct + Animovore + deaths (Necrogeddon)*

For each death next to the enchanted Construct
Place the Construct in the middle of your board with Animovore on it, Construct is buffed by X).

*Deaths (Necrogeddon) + Totem of Suffering* 

*Necrogeddon + bonus-on-death creatures*

*Poisons + Miasma Well*

**The decklist**

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#6676

**Resource spread**

1D / 3 : Mangy Rat

2D / 4 : Animovore, Loyal Darkling

3D / 4 : Blightbearer, Brain Lice

4D / 4 : Totem of Suffering, Ilmire Hunter

5D / 1 : Oblivion Seeker

6D / 1 : Necrogeddon

This is a mono resource deck with a lot of low cost scrolls

**Past and possible future changes**

Pretty much everything is susceptible to change when scrolls themselves are and the deck has not been tested. 

*Update 1* : Rot Eater is out as it works poorly with the deck (what's the point of boosting it if it's going to die 3 turns later). Replaced with Ilmire Hunter

It's also 51 scrolls at the moment

**Strategy**

This is based on zero play test so it's very possible that this does not work well at all. 

*Early game* 

Get some cheap creatures out. You can put out a Construct and Animovore early on the second line with some disposable creatures in front. You can start to get a poison engine going with some Wells. Soul Steal and Languid will get rid of some early threats like Brave with a net scroll cost of 0. 
Get a Lumbering Muckhead (or 2 !) out as soon as you can. 
I guess you can get Totems out at this point but I imagine it's a better idea to hold on to them or sac (they are likely to get quaked away mid game). 

*Mid game*

Time to get those Muckheads to go to town. Do not hesitate to Damning Curse big threats (Great Wolves, use them liberally. 

*Late game*

Hopefully you have build a decent board presence with a Construct + Animovore in the center. If you run low on creatures, ad nauseam !
Try to get one or more Totems of Suffering out just before 'Geddon

**Matchups**

Again

*Growth*

You can compete on early game with some cheap creatures of your own. Languid can neuter an early Brave. You creatures are weaker but you should be able to hold your ground

*Order*

I'm really not sure how that match up would go
Spiky is going to kill a lot of your stuff, Pushback on a Lumbering about to attack = sadface). Good news is, an Order opponent has no ways to deal with your nasty structures outside of direct creature damage... and Speed Mangonel, which will probably hurt just as much as it does other decks. There's a reasonable chance you can get enough draw going to keep up with Imperial Ressources late game. 

*Energy*

Structure removal is going to hurt a lot. Fortunately nobody runs Incendiaries, they'll never be able to keep up with your draw. It might still be a tough matchup.

Soul Steal: I love this card. It's a Spark that only affects units it can kill, but it is not out of the question to sacrifice your own units in decay.

Blightbearer: At first, but the best part is the effect it has. It can wipe an entire row of units with poison. Good positioning is essential, but this thing can set up some insane combos. I thought the drawback is it can kill your own units, but decay has many moments where that is actually a good thing. I will definitely be having a lot of fun with this one.

Despite that

* Countdown in low levels / Haste
* Board Clearing ability
* Ability to draw cards

----------------------------------------------------------

**[Concept Deck: http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#5246](http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/#5246)** 

This is the *concept* deck

The concept was to: 

* Increase squishy units to easily be able to regain control of board
* Increase Ability to Draw to prevent diminishing returns due to use of low cost cards
* Add enchantments to ensure that despite the units being squishy they have defensive properties

Cards I don't have 3 of: Magonels

**What I need?**

Help. I'm really struggling here. I think I may have strayed too far from Order's strong suit. Patience and waiting for units to stack. However

--------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT**

Thanks everyone for the advice!

* Focus on High Health Units
* Suffer the first turns
* Remove enchantments involving units dying (as units should not be)

The decks were pretty consistent. 

* Any Order Unit with more than 3 or more health
* Mangonel for possible board clearing ability
* Flip
* Blessing of Haste and Speed for turn speed
* Focus for attack strength
* Kabonk for the early game
* Imperial Resources for the late game

As a MTG veteran I appreciate the streamlined resource management. No more ways to get mana screwed :) also the hex battle field offers another layer of strategic depth that is very different from most classical TCGs. Playing seems to reward the better player more than the better cards (to a limit)

That having been said

No1 (by a huge margin): more content!!! There are only three factions at the moment and each of these factions has only about 40 cards. There seem to be very few variances in the top decks of each color and a lot of cards are absolute must haves for their faction (Kinfolk Brave e.g). Other cards are absolutely unplayable (Junkyard anyone)
In each color there seems to be a deck that wants to be built regardless of your preferences of strategy. Consider just one color in one block of magic. There are dozens of possibilitys for building a deck

No2: more game modes. As it is now there are only a couple of easy to use battle modes for some quick matches. In itself this is fine, picks their favorite and gives the rest to the next player. Something similar is planned for Hearthstone afaik. Sealed deck modes would also offer variety, once the card pool has been increased.

**Galvanic Cascade**

3E

Spell

-Deal 2 damage for each energy spell played this turn

Flavor Txt - *""First there's a tingle

First one is a personal dear wish for energy: a 3 cost kill spell. By it self it is an expensive spark. But you can combine it spark for 6 damage, so you cant abuse low cost cantrips from other factions, and as energy has no low cost cantrips it seems to come out to be fairly useless on its own until you need to specifically kill a big creature and don't have VD in hand. 


**Discharge**

1E

Spell

- Deal a random opponent Unit is 1 damage. If that Unit is destroyed

Flavor Txt - *""Watch you head boyos

I won't deny it, it is a god send early vaetters and other 1 health annoyances, though probably not worth the card slot on its own it synergizes pretty well with Galvanic Cascade. 


**Arc Technician**

4E

Creature - Human

1 Attack 

Ranged*

When Arc Technician comes into play

When Arc Technician is destroyed

Flavor Txt - *~Bzzrt~*

This is my favorite of the bunch, early to mid game consistency. It's spell summon ability helps insure you have the kill spells to maintain board advantage. When it leaves play, it grants a second spell, but you have less control of when you get that effect, unless you are running Nutrition or other less than common cards. The second issue it resolves is maintaining lategame card advantage. The card is an unwieldy 4E cost, so its not easily abusable and the creature drop is pretty weak. In addition, the card is a soft counter to quake

1372271461.0,1h4hej,What mechanics would you like to see?,Zechnophobe,13,4,11,"Here's my thoughts

**Mechanic #1:** Cannot Be Sacrificed

* *Sovereign of the Night*
* 6/2/4
* Cost 5
* Creature - Assassin
* Cannot be Sacrificed

This is about as simple as it comes. Cannot be sacrificed means that the card may not be used to generate mana, and can't play it, you are stuck for the turn. Or early on you can't sacrifice it for mana to play other cards. It's a very strong negative effect. So why is a strong NEGATIVE effect an interesting mechanic?  Because it allows you to pair it with strong effects to create an interesting bit of tension on the player during deck design. The same way the 4/1/2 automaton that dies after it attacks is empowered by its sacrifice effect, so too can things with 'cannot be sacrificed'.



**Mechanic #2:** Invisibility


* *Nightmine*
* Structure
* -/-/1
* Cost 2
* Invisible (Does not show on the map
* When Nightmine is killed by an attack

or

* *Thoughtful Assassin*
* Creature - Assassin
* 4/2/1
* Cost 3
* Invisible (Does not show on the map
* Whenever you sacrifice

The invisible mechanic is somewhat positive, which is bad, but allows it to progress towards its victory condition, which is good. The two example cards I have here are two styles of this mechanic. The first is the 'nightmine' that is a defensive structure rigged to explode. The enemy doesn't see it, but will destroy it if they attack it. (Unless they deal zero damage I guess). This lets you use it as a hidden defense and play mind games. The game handles invisible creatures by showing that the opponent is casting them, but not showing where they are summoned to. This means that the non owner has to 'figure out' where the unit is if they want to attack it. Obviously some structures/creatures will be able to defend against invisible or reveal it.

The Assassin creature is a different take on Invisibility. It gives you the option of using it as an attacked (But then it will be vulnerable to counter attack and spells), but be vulnerable, or slowly chip away at enemy idols.



**Mechanic #3:** Punishers


* *Desolate Punisher*
* Creature - Nomad
* Cost 1
* 1/2/1
* Desolate Punisher gains +3 Attack for each destroyed enemy Idol.

The punisher mechanic, or their analogs, can power up.  This Desolate Punisher unit is a pretty terrible 1 cost creature.. unless you have an enemy idol down. Then it's a cheap powerhouse that could let you push through to victory that much faster.  By creating cards that want you to skip the normal 'kill all their guys before they kill your guys' mentality, we create different avenues to victory and more decisions on the part of the player. Sacrifice my powerful kinfolk brave so my first idol doesn't go down? Or let them start dropping 4/2/1 punishers for 1.



**Mechanic #4:** Rank/File


* *Mesmeric Tower*
* Structure
* Cost 4
* -/-/3
* Can only be placed in the front of a row.
* Enemies in the same row as Mesmeric Tower have -1 movement and -1 Attack.

There are two different but related mechanics here. The first is the idea that the position of a structure/creature could be limited or cause modifiers. In this case, and weaken them. This is very strong of course, since you can lock down some enemies, and the only reason it isn't overpowered, is because of that first effect... You can't put the tower in the back where it could be defended (nor can you stack up multiples of the tower to make all enemies do no damage)

By caring about rank and file positioning in the game, would also be an interesting defensive structure (though a much weaker one).",,False,self,t5_2scq0,1372271869.0,,

But there's a problem. Movement superiority isn't really important that often. I would guess that the devs imagined a game where players spread out their units, so it's perfectly viable to ignore half the board. What's more, players almost exclusively arrange their units in phalanxes with high hp units at the front and valuable units in the back. This means that even if you can move a long ways, it's not going to do anything because your opponent has no weak spots to move towards.

This emphasis on grouping units in the same row means that players instead focus on cards that let them overpower or dismantle their opponent's rows.  Hence we have Focus and Blessing of Haste as high-tier cards for overpowering opponents, and Flip allow you to dismantle your opponent's rows, negating walls and exposing valuable units.

1. Order &gt; Growth. Order has many spells that seem to hard counter growth spells. Most growth strategies are centered around buffing a single unit to all hell, kinfolk etc. However order can simply remove the enchants or flip it out of safety and 1 shot it with focus. Pushback also removes enchants. There are many spells that seem to simply hard counter any growth strategy centered on single units. I have lost countless games solely from Flip, and imho it is the only truly broken scroll in the game. It should at least have a resource cost of more than 2. The only way I have beaten order as growth is if I crush the early game which is completely dependent on the other guy not drawing ""spiky 2"" spearmen guys.

2. Growth &gt; Energy (sorta). This one is much less concrete. I have found that Energy has a tough time stopping growth from building to the point of no return unless they simply outplay them hard. Much of energy is based on large area of effect play

3. Energy&gt;Order. Now, Order feels very weak against Energy. Much of Energy is focused on aoe play, while much of Order is focused on clumping up a bunch of creatures for the buffs. These two factors clearly give Energy the advantage. The single target spells of order and positional play mean less (or much, much more) when much of the board is covered in blast zones.

Another option is say a spell too that would do the same thing where damage is redirected. This could still be purified off or pushed back

One that I think would be interesting too would be all damage from any spell would be ignored for 3 turns.

1. Do you go first?
2. Do you have a Kinfolk Brave in your hand by turn 2 and can he survive a possible Ranger's Bane?

If you answer positive to both questions you will win most of the time in growth vs growth. 

The reason I think these 2 factors can determine the outcome of a game is because growth is a deck about board control. In a mirror match-up, and have something to block/buff for it, he can snowball into a situation that Quake might not even salvage at that point. 

The things I can come up with to prevent getting swept by a single Brave are as followed:

1. If the other player doesn't have a buff in his hand

2. Counter with your own Brave

Other than those you could potentially root it in place, and who can have an early Brave that is protected in some way.

http://www.scrollsguide.com/deckbuilder/?d=1817

This deck centers around amassing a large amount of resource and cards and juggling the two haste creatures

Callback and Metempsychosis can be used to refresh the cooldown on a haste unit

Divine Mark helps keep your Vets in play if they're going to die

Heritage, and the Memorials act to give you a giant scroll and resource advantage. With call back, metempsychosis and memorials I've been able to get a total of 6 resources by turn 3.

Quake, and Pushback all help to exacerbate your scroll advantage by clearing the board. They can also be used to trigger your Heritage if needed. Decimate is also very useful for weakening the idols enough for a Vet+Focus+Focus to take it out. And you will have that opportunity often seeing as once the deck gets going you'll be playing a good 6 cards per round.

Blessing of Haste will allow your haste units to attack every round you happen to have on in your hand.

Royal Infantrymen act to make your haste creatures beefier

I used to run Faith Chains in this deck since I tend to kill a lot of my own units

Edit: I edited the deck a bit. I've been having difficulty with high HP units so I threw in a Unleash Inner Power so I can take them down to 2 hp instantly. I also added summons since it can be a problem if you don't get a lot of memorials at the start.

Cards that use the energy dump mechanic but cost a different resources. An example I thought of would be like a half dead Frankenstein cyborg type creature. It would cost 3 decay have zero atk 1 cd and like 3 hp and then an effect were you can pay energy to increase its Atk for that turn. Or maybe a decay creature that took dmg at the end of every turn if you didn't put energy in to it. Cards like these would be great to splash because even if you were not drawing energy cards you could use your energy every turn.

Puppet soilder plus nutrition - This card combo is insane, or by changing puppet soilder's effect changed to deal an amount of damage. Again it can be played around, but it's simply not much fun to do so.

Restless Bones - I would like to see undead as a subtype for most/all of the human types in Decay

Rat King - I would prefer this card be a three cost that gives two rats. Right now, primarily being that it gave growth a perfect curve. Also because it has amazing synergy with Fertile Soil, Crimson Bull, Ancestral Totem,  and Godhand. And while it's not as game breaking with soil anymore, it's still amazingly good for other synergy's I mentioned. Personally I would prefer it be a three drop that gives two rats since growth is severly lacking on it's three drops.

Illmire Hunter - I don't see why this card needs five health

Wings Solder and Sister of the Bear - I love the concept of blank cards with great stats, with one more hp she would be great. Some people might disagree with me, saying these stats are too strong, but considering they have no effect... I feel slightly stronger stats makes sense here.

Fleetness - I think some people see the one cooldown as a lot stronger than it is. The idea of this card is you can double the value of a card for a lower cost than the card you cast it on, but not amazing. 

Magnetizer - This card is one of the weakest three drop cards in it's current state, which isn't gamebreakingly good as some people believe it to be, it's just good.

Necrogeddon - I haven't had a chance to test this card in it's newer state

So that does it for my ''what Yugi would like changed'', then that's ok too. I just think these changes would be nice. At least on the test server where we can hammer out the cards that are too strong or too weak. I'd also like to see cards released at a faster pace, as this is beta, and even if something isn't perfect, I'd hope we could simply change it on the main servers.",,False,t5_2scq0,True

1. You cannot choose to take dmg directly to your idol and let your early creatures live (in magic

2. If a 2 turn attack unit with 2-3 dmg comes out in the middle of the board

3. Early dominance on the board is difficult to overturn unless with a good pother (even as splash on another type) followed by surge or double quake (most good players wont put many creatures with 2 hp expecting them to live early mid game)

4. There aren't enough viable defensive or counter tactics against early dominance helped tremendously by who goes first. In Magic and other TCG, pushback, root, pother, etc, it is not defendable against players who currently dominate the board. There aren't even spells that make the creatures immune to magic that will allow you to have a chance of gaining momentum mid game by putting say, iron golem in the middle of the board that will eventually come into effect 3 turns later.

It's come to that as a ranked energy player, he will establish early dominance and never let go (unless I get lucky pother + surge). Because the losers dont get much points, I've started to actually just surrender at turn 2-3 if I go second against growth players who've had some decent early drops.

I know this games in beta, more so than ANY other TCG I've ever played.

Potential solutions I came up with:
1. Increase the cooldown by 1 for the first one or two units the first player plays
2. Decrease the hp of all 5 idols by 1-2 for the first player

Coming from Magic:The Gathering I'm kind of disappointed to see that both resource and card generation seem to be handled by discarding any scroll. It feels a bit like taking a shortcut to me as it might restrict the game's possibilities.

I know that being out of resources or options isn't fun but at the same time I feel it should be part such a card game.

1376513971.0,1kdhdf,My problem with Winperials: You get card advantage without outplaying your opponent.,andy013,18,15,37,"Hey

You can be making even trades all game and then your opponent plays 2-3 imperials and they shoot ahead in card advantage to a point where it is impossible to catch them (unless you also have it in your deck). This is super frustrating to play against and it feels unfair. My opponent didn't capitalize on my mistakes...he just played a magic card advantage spell with nothing I could do against it. 

You could also say that fertile soil is the same but I don't really have a problem with it. I'm not sure why, or maybe it's because growth doesn't have as many insane combos for clearing the board in the late game. I don't know. 

I'd be interested to hear what other people think of these 2 cards. Overall I think it feels much fairer if your opponent can only get card advantage by destroying your units and outplaying you on the board. Quake is much less frustrating that Winperials to me. 

I'd also be interested to hear where Mojang stands on this card and how they feel about it as it is currently. ",self,t5_2scq0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1kdhdf/my_problem_with_winperials_you_get_card_advantage/

Key is poison damage and card synergy. 
Decay have some great cards but no Rally witch work great here. Rally + mangy rat/infected gravelock  for instant poison or lumbering muckhead/ilmire hunter for instant destruction. Other combo is nutrition + puppet soldier that will probably be nerfed. But nutrition/fertile soil + blightbearer still work.

Lot of buildings is great weakness but I dont think I will have lot of problems with it in this meta (biggest problem is probably well placed druid).

Mire curse and bitter root was discarded because they suck.

Still trying to work in 2quakes and 1 necrogedon.

If puppet soldier nutrition get nerfed i would probably use summons to get more miasma wells

1376419058.0,1kam65,D/O deck list,Stitch_Hax,4,2,11,"Okay

Before anyone even mentions Pother

Order:

3x Powerbound--because Tethered Recruit needs to die for the +1 order also

3x Heritage--card draw and because you want Decay to die.

3x Summons--Miasma Well or Waking Stones will only run one or the other.

3x Puri--Because why not?

3x Kabonk--for a while

Decay:

3x Mangy Rat--because poison and easy to kill. Also cheap.

3x Husk--honestly

3x Infected Gravelock--a pseudo-structure

3x Tethered Recruit--duh.

3x Languid--card draw and making Braves useless. Also making Ilmire Hunters useless.

3x Miasma Well--with all the poison I am running

3x Blight Bearer--Moar Poison.

3x Lumbering Muckhead--do I need explain?

3x Brainlice--the more I look at this card

2x Soul Steal--to sack Powerbound/Heritaged Tethered. Or to eat your Sister of the Fox or Veatter. Why Staggering Muckhead is not in the deck.

3x Ilmire Hunter--this will probably be killing more things than Lumbering Muckhead.

3x Damning Curse--Yes.

So, Life Stealer, or Witchdoctor? Why would I run Oblivion Seeker when I already have so many smaller cards that give me a more immidiate effect? Why run Cursemonger when Lumbering, Hunter, Poison and Damning Curse will kill everything anyway? Why run Witchdoctor if you have only 3 human creatures in your deck?

A friend of mine has got me thinking about a new game mode.  
In card games like magic, to mix things up. Now, in scrolls, that is currently not possible, thus I hereby suggest this new game mode:

**Best of three**  
Before you start a match, as usual.  
Now, your opponent his.  
The second game, he uses your deck.  
If one player managed to win two times
Otherwise, both can *choose, which of the two decks they want to use*.",,False,self,t5_2scq0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/1k0yum/game_mode_idea_best_of_three/

**Scroll Gambling (name subject to change)**

Here's the overall idea. 

1. Like crafting you place three of a single scroll (or 3 different scrolls of the same rarity) in the crafting area

1. Another idea

That's really it for that. It's just something else for those that aren't into actually crafting and have many extra scrolls that they can't sell/trade in market (store doesn't pay a good return at all) or like the idea of gambling scrolls to obtain better scrolls. 

Now here's a slight concern from myself and some in the community.

**Gold earned per game isn't enough for losers or A.I. matches**

This is only a minor problem for me, it got myself (along with others) thinking that maybe something like this should be more of a frequent thing to keep people playing, and not feel like playing the A.I. or even against actual people is anyway pointless or annoying. Here's a few adjustments/ideas that I think could help with the game.

*  Increasing gold for losers in ranked or quick match by 100g (adjusted for time played) for staying
* Adjusted rates for A.I. matches. An additional 50g for easy
* Daily bonus gold (similar to a first win of the day bonus)
*or a double gold day once a week. 

A slightly long post

tl;dr A new gold sink idea similar to LOL's rune crafting system with scrolls instead

Edit: Reworked the crafting idea based on feedback.
