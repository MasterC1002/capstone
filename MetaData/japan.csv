What usually happens is I'll go out, shops, etc and strike up a conversation (either I start it or they do).   Eventually one of us leaves and we exchange info.  Sometimes I'll suggest we meet up again for a drink/food and sometimes they suggest it.

I'll verify my identity if you want me to.

I recently made a video about Racism in Japan, but instead of high volume speakers, they flood the comments section with confusion and spin.  And they flag Japanese comments that support my video as spam.  

I think if you watch the video in full

I don't think racism is any worse in Japan than other countries. As a Japanese-American

Anyway

It seems like there are a lot of good Japanese speakers/readers here so I won't translate it.  (Plus



本当は、日本語でコメントを残したかったのですが（日本人の人にも読んでほしくて...）でも、ポストできず、英語にしましたが文字数が全く足りず...涙、目玉先生に、私の母国語である日本語でも意見を伝えたくて、書き込みをした日本語のコメント+をお送りしたくてPMしてしまいました。

バカちょんカメラ...聞いたことあります。悪気があったわけではない状態で普通に家族で使っていました。でも、意味が分かって一斉に利用をやめましたが...

部落差別のある村で少し生活をした事がありますが、実際きちんと状況について教えてもらった事がありません。ただ噂話のように ""あそこに住む人は北朝鮮人だから...""と指をさす人がいました。日本語を話す人達だったので実際本当に朝鮮半島の方なのか否か分からなかったので私は無視して普通に接していましたが...すごく深い傷を持って生きている人たちがいるのは少しだけ耳にしたことがあります。やはり、自分が対象になってないから大したことじゃない!精神が強いようです。

私が1つ思う事は、（日本だけを基準で書きますが）自分達のした事で非のあることはあまり実際学校では習わない・教えない感じを受けます。父と第二次世界大戦の話になった際に、日本が近隣国に対して行った行動はあまり取り上げられていないことがわかり、父が驚いて、真実は知っておくべきだ！と日本の行動を反日的ではなくただ事実として話してくれました。具体的にかいてしまうと、すぐに""日本人のくせに反日だ！海外に住んでるからって...""ということを言われてることがあるので本当に意見を公にて分かち合うのは大変です。

日本では日本の非と受け止められてしまう（そういう気持ちがなくても）事は、すぐこのように'反日'という印象を与えてしまう可能性があるから心配...と避けられているような気がしますが、どう思われますか?　学校でこのような話をする先生がいたら、きっとどこかで『反日だ!』と少なくはなってきてるとしても言う方がいるような気がします。

私は生まれも育ちも日本ですが、1つどうしてもわからないことがあるのです。もちろんすべての人ではありませんが、なぜ日本人はある種の""defensive""な行動をとるのでしょうか？　意見を、そうだね、考えてみよう! という人もいるとは思いますが、すぐに ""そんなこと...""そして""日本人ではない人がそんな話をして！反日だ"" と頭ごなしにしてしまう...残念なことだと思います。

国際人を育てたい日本は、海外からの人達の意見や考え方にもっと耳を傾けなくてはいけないと私は思うのです。そしてうまく意見を交換する。これは別の話になっていしまうので辞めておきます笑

長々となってしまってごめんなさい。
私はコメディータッチの目玉先生のビデオも、今回の人種差別についてのビデオも大好きです。ニコニコ動画の生放送で深くではないですが、人種差別の話をしたことがありますが、気が付いている人がたくさんいましたよ。なので、日本もそこまで真っ暗ではないとは思いますが、もっと親の世代が子供とこの様な話をしなくてはいけないと思います。

あ！また付け足してしまった!!

A while back my mom found Yukifumi Shibasaki on Instagram. He's a graphic designer/photographer/artist. She showed me his feed and I started following him too because I really loved his work. Through Facebook and commenting on each other's photos my mom and him became friends.

One day, a letter, a collection of flyers he had designed, and a cute little illustration done by his girlfriend (see the gallery link for pictures).

I was just so struck by this gesture, debt, having go to onto welfare, and suffering depression. And now he's hoping to build a new career around his paintings. It makes me feel so happy that mine and my mom's words have given him confidence in his work.

Here's the links to his Instagram and Flickr accounts if anyone would like to see his other work:

As we're waiting, cause I'm trying to figure out if she was talking to me, considering it was evening and I hadn't really done anything to merit the pat on the back. And she was facing the elevator.

After a moment, so I just got in the elevator. She pushed 3 and I pushed 7.

We get to the 3rd floor and she feels the need to bow out to me as she exits. As she anticipates the door opening, she wacks her head on the door with all her might.

I was speechless and as surprised as she was as she bolted for her apartment. It was an awesome awkward performance

A Shimane JET was arrested about 6 weeks ago and is being held for trying to import 6.9 *grams* of MJ via the postal system. He has been charged but his first court date isn't until February next year. 

It's a foregone conclusion that he will be held in custody until the completion of his trial. Trials here are very open ended

He faces up to 5 years in the slammer but as a first offender a suspended sentence

Personally I find Japan's strict MJ laws to be pretty hypocritical considering the situation with drinking and tobacco. However we don't get to make the laws and the laws here are really

Be smart

Edit: It seems some people think I am expecting sympathy for this guy. I'm not. He fucked up and he knew better. All JETs are warned very strongly about Japanese drug laws at their orientation. I posted this here simply as a warning to those who may be thinking that ""Hey, and the repercussions are insanely harsh.

**Update 1:** 10 kilo area is said to be the danger zone. they just said that at this time the rods have melted but most radiation is still being shielded by the building. People in the area please stay calm and follow evacuation instructions.

**Update 2:** According to the talking head on ABC (Japan TV) this will NOT be another chernobyl. The nuclear reaction is shut down during an earthquake. In Chernobyl it was a run away nuclear meltdown

**Update 3:** They are having problems keeping coolant in. The level of the coolent is slowly going down. If this increases the other rods will melt and there is a chance that the 10 kilo evacuation circle will be increased but at this time only a part of the rods are thought to have melted and radiation is being contained. 

Also they are having problems with Fukushima #2. The vents that get rid of steam are not working properly. 

**Update 4:** There was the sound of something exploding around 3:30 (4 people have been taken to the hospital)

**Update 5:** The TV ticker says the building holding the rods has collapsed.

**Update 6:** The line that the radiation reading (a year's worth in 1 hour) was taken was on the line that is drawn between the reactor area and public area (border?).  I just directly translated that. I guess they mean on the edge of the reactor land?!

**Update 7:**  10km evac area has just been increased by 10km. 20km area evacuation area has just been announced. (7:00pm tokyo time)

**Update 8:** IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will be holding an emergency meeting from 8:00p.m. (tokyo time)  to deside what is needed to be done.

**Update 9:** The people evacuated by bus from the surrounding cities do not have a destination. For tonight they have joined others in evacuation spots (community centers

**Update 10: **The explosion was from Hydrogen which caused the outer wall to blowout. The container holding the radioactive material was not broken. **Radioactive material has not been released at high levels. The radioactive levels that were taken earlier have dropped at a considerable rate.**

**Update 11: **At this time they are using ocean water to cool the reactor down. It will take 5 hours to do this (they just said to totally fill the chamber will take 10 days). The ocean water will be used to cool the outside as they continue to use pumps to cool the inside.

**Last Update for now** cause it looks like we won't learn anything new for a while. To translate what the tv people were saying about radiation levels being high at the time of the explosion. This is of course conjecture on their part but here goes...

 The coolant levels dropped exposing the tops of the rods. Some of the rods melted. At the same time a chemical reaction caused an increase of hydrogen. The explosion happened and with the rods exposed high levels of radiation are detected. Rods are again covered with coolant. Radiation levels drop.

   I could see her leaning into the back seat of her car and I was worried there could be another person in the back seat. I got closer and saw a young child laying down in the back seat, and took her away in a stretcher, while her mother screamed at the sky, at me, at her child. I quickly asked an EMT if the child was dead, he said ""no.""  I was so relieved. A weight lifted. I could still hear the chatter from the gathering crowd, ""baka gaijin"" being the only thing i could make out. And one older man even throwing a snowball at me from the crowd. I was escorted away quickly by the EMTs. I was fine, went home
   Went to the police station
   Few days later the insurance informs me that is was 50-50 fault. I was a little suprised but I accepted that. They also informed me that the child in the back seat, how could such a serious injury take place? I was then told she was NOT wearing a seatbelt, and hit her head. 
   Few weeks later I have to go back into the police station and i am charged with injuring someone while driving? or something like that. The police told me I will be fined,000$ and i have no way of affording that. i am completely broke and i havent even started working here yet. 

TL;DR:: I was in a car accident,000$ for injuring her. 
    
  Like i said i am somewhat new here, and i will have to get a loan, and the money is a way of saying sorry. Is there no way i can defend myself? The other driver lied about her child wearing a seatbelt on her report. 
  Im sorry for the wall of text

EDIT 1: The girl is out of the coma

EDIT 2: Apparently there is some confusion. The fact that I am responsible at all is bs. She was speeding, is bogus. If I were at all responsible, or if i lost control and slid into her lane, or even into the middle, i would not have a problem paying the consequences. But that is not the case. She lied, and who knows who else lied, so that the blame would be shared.

EDIT 3: Wow, it was really my word vs hers when it comes to the child not wearing a seatbelt, and apparently they took hers. I was told that it should have been no more than 10% my fault, but that i would still have to pay a fine regardless. I was told that even if i was at a stop light, and she rear ended me, i would be charged with the same crime. Such is the law in Japan. The money for the fine is a very important gesture i was told. And that refusing to pay would result in a much heavier crime. I have two weeks to pay the 3,000$",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1dszrc/i_was_in_a_car_accident_im_being_fined_and_could/

Of course there will still be travel posts here, etc.  But maybe we can achieve a bit better balance if we start using /r/JapanTravel, and everybody can be a little happier.

I'd like to share my updates to counter some fear mongering.,johnwalkr,147,14,44,"I'm moving to a new location so I'm just quickly copy-pasting this from multiple facebook notes/[blog posts](http://www.inertreactants.com/?p=237). There might be some repeated statements

**update 1:**
I am OK in Sendai

They are already starting to restore power and water to the city of Sendai.

The earthquake itself was pretty scary but afterwards everything is very well organized; we waited outside after the earthquake and eventually were allowed to grab our stuff from the lab. We left quickly after an aftershock and possible gas leak. At my dorm we are staying together in a group.

Where I am located in the city I don't have running water or power but we are safe with lots of food and water.

Although the shaking was quite violent

It was much worse to the West where soil conditions are worse and to the East where tsunamis hit. We weren't aware of how serious things were until we heard news reports.

In the city today

Local groups are also making rice and soup for people. Basically the same food I've been eating since I arrived

Convenience stores were open today, as well as flashlights and batteries.

Amazingly

There are buildings designated as refuges where people in tall and evacuated buildings are staying.

The news images are not from Sendai city

The nuclear reactors are not posing a serious risk according to local media

We are not sure if/when we can go back to the lab. Many experiments were damaged but our rover was OK when we left it. I am uploading pictures from the lab and city now.

I'm currently with friends in the city centre where we found power and 3G internet. I should be able to update occasionally directly and via friends (email is sporadically working on my phone).

I want to stress that I am OK and in a safe place.

**update 2:**
Update: the rover is ok and in my dorm. Many are leaving Sendai by (free) bus

The journey to Tokyo is indirect and about 20 hours. It looks like convenience stores and supermarkets are out of food but military trucks are starting to arrive with supplies

Where there is power

Life downtown is pretty normal. Inspections appear to have started today and some are back at work.

Still no power or running water in my area but we have lots of supplies.

A main concern is aftershocks of up to M7, is that it's not very dangerous for us, 80km away.

**update 3:**
Many people are leaving Sendai, as food only took one day to start arriving.

I'm the only english speaker left at my dorm

I already had a bus ticket to Tokyo for this weekend. I have no idea if I can get on that bus. It will need to be rerouted as normally it goes though Fukushima.

University is closed until at least May. My internship was supposed to end in late April. My current plan is to get to Tokyo when I can

There is a small amount of work to get part of our GLXP rover to Europe for testing and demonstrations. I will be bringing those parts to Tokyo in order to ship them. The rest of the rover is safe in my dorm.

If I get stuck in Sendai I should be safe. There were a couple of large (M6?) aftershocks today and they are expected for one month up to M7 (100 times less energy than the original). There is plenty of food and water available and my dorm now has water

The main concern is nuclear fallout but from what I understand of the design and situation of the reactors were are reasonably safe. Preventative medicine is available if it is needed and the worst case scenario does not involve danger at short-term exposure lengths.

Many thanks to the heroic nuclear workers who have sacrificed their lives keeping the country safe.",,t5_2qh2u,False,,text tohoku,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/g3l35/i_live_in_sendai_and_am_ok_id_like_to_share_my/

I found a camera while on vacation in Thailand

Facebook/Google+/LinkedIn searches haven't turned up much.

Do you guys have any thoughts on how I could go about this

Thanks!


PS. checked with the mods in advance to make sure this post is OK.

**Edit**:  Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and offers to help out!  I'm planning on calling the embassy here in the US today to see if they can help.  I have also emailed Tohoku Institute of Technology to see if they know him.

**UPDATE (8/7 1:15PM)**: Got a hold of the Consulate-General of Japan in San Fransisco and the woman I spoke to seemed to want to help out!  I gave her his name and passport number along with my contact info and she said she would see if the passport folks upstairs would be able to contact him.  I think I'll give them a few days.  If I don't hear anything back I'll PM some of those that offered their assistance to continue the search.  I'll keep updating as this unfolds.  Fingers crossed!

**UPDATE2 (8/7 1:35PM)**: Already got a call back from the same woman I spoke to.  Basically just confirming that she passed the info along and ""things are happening.""

**UPDATE3 (8/12 1PM)**:  Well

**UPDATE4 (8/14 5:50PM)**:  Success!  Just got off the phone with a guy at the Consulate in San Francisco and he found the owner.  I'm going to mail it to the consulate tomorrow and he will send it to the owner from there.

The brief version is that it’s painless

**If you want more details ...**


**Previous day**

Your last meal is before 9:00 p.m. and you are to avoid sweet potatoes, gobou, raisins, cucumber, kiwi, wakame, negi, spinach, and a few other things.

You drink a laxative at 9:00


**Day of the procedure**

1) Getting to the hospital is a bit stressful

2) At the hospital, but it’s not a pleasant time. On the positive side, it’s all downhill from there.

3) After drinking it all, so I spent the time at my office, making multiple trips to the men’s room.

4) While you’re purging, make the nurses squeal with admiration. [http://imgur.com/5HRcd](http://imgur.com/5HRcd)

5) At 2:00 p.m., and a kind of paper tunic. This is great, because with all the nurses running around, you’re not standing there naked, but are fashionably posed in your paper tunic.

6) They give you an intravenous drip, a few compliments on your Japanese ability, an intravenous painkiller, and the camera is up your butt before you know it! You can watch on the screen, just like Hank Hill’s family did in King of the Hill, Season 1.

7) The actual procedure only took about 20 minutes. You can’t feel anything, you rest for 30 minutes before you’re free to go.

**Update:** I found out at my consultation 3 days later that I actually fell asleep during the procedure! I had no idea. I thought the sedatives had no effect on me, sorry if I gave everyone the impression that this was painless without sedatives. Rather, it's painless WITH sedatives, logically enough.

This may cost you $1500 in the U.S. Ha! I paid $83! Thank god for socialized medicine!

In all seriousness

But I hope I never have to do it again.

I work for an ""international company"" and my colleagues are just up and returning to their countries.  I understand that they need to be safe and all that

Others have been staying at my house when the trains go down because I don't like long commutes and can walk to the office.  Good people, but he never offered to share the ride with our stranded coworkers.

The international news is pissing me off royally.  Thanks for the nonstop disaster scenes and alarming headlines!  My mom back in the States is scared shitless.  I can't talk to her on the phone because she just puts me on edge and I don't have time for it.

I have to walk up 6 flights of stairs to ""save energy"" and all the stores are empty.  I'm craving pastries

I know things could be a hell of a lot worse.  I could have been further up north.  Hell

It came down from the local Board of Education to us on February 1st

We will soon be pressured by our dispatch companies and other employers to sign contracts for June right away. If we do this we will not be eligible for the unemployment insurance we have been paying into.

This is a trend that has been eroding working conditions since the economy took the downturn. If the local Board of Education can get away with this move, families and lives they can not afford to simply drop.

We are asking for your suggestions and any information you can provide that will help us find a way to make this work. Even moral support is appreciated. Some people have already started a letter writing campaign to the city mayor and there is a lot of buzz going on to bring people together.

At the very least we hope you will spread the word about what is happening here.

Managed to dig up a lot of garbage from a field in the afternoon. When the work was done the owner of the field gave a short speech saying thanks, and then work on replanting, and maybe have strawberries in time for when they sell them at Christmas (to a lot of applause).

Please remember, vegetables, sake, and more. There are a lot of people working hard to re-establish their livelihoods, and that's something you can help with in your day-to-day life.

At the time I worked in the Miyagi prefectural office. We evacuated about 10 minutes after the quake (had to sweep the floor for injured or trapped people)

As the prefectural office is the HQ for relief operations, corpses scattered amongst debris in the middle of destroyed cities, familiar places where I’d gone to for festivals and to visit famous sites, places where I had friends. The only thing to over take this in my own personal “horrible” rating was when I went myself a week after to ID a body and a few times after that and saw it all for myself. Those are the memories that I find waiting on the nights when I can’t sleep.  

As days passed, as well as the more general TV news coverage (we got main power back just in time to see the first wave hitting Natori on live TV. Later on when they were showing stranded commuters in Tokyo I angrily questioned why they were focusing there and not on our area, and when they cut to video of Kesennuma burning, I really missed the commuters all a sudden) painted a picture that was hard to believe, despite being there: I mean, this was the sort of thing you saw on TV in a far away place, not where you live. I was there and it didn’t seem real.

Despite all of this, and came back after the time he was given off ran out, before he was able to locate his mother (she died in the tsunami, but the rest of his family managed to evacuate). Him, and everyone else kept working and so did I. I’d be a liar if I said I wasn’t afraid; hell, it was May before I made it a full week without thinking I was going to die at any moment, but my job was to confirm the safety of people and assist them any way I can, so my coworkers and I just kept at it.

For the first week, and after the building’s maintenance staff requested that they share them, people did), but even this was resolved by making a reservation list on a scrap of cardboard from a box of blankets. I saw people leaving a food line to let a women with children get a share in their place, and I began to see that despite the awful situation, people weren’t going to stop being human. 

I watched with sun come up from the window of my office on March 12th (shining through the smoke of a massive refinery fire that was the only light outside the night before) and forced myself to think. This was obviously an undesirable situation, and now I was hearing about a nuclear plant in Fukushima some 100km south seemed to be out of control, I had to decide what I was going to do, stay or leave, even if just temporarily. It took all of one minute. There was no way in Hell (fire-caves version or the version I was in) I would leave, abandon friends and people closer than some family, desert my job at a time when it was especially needed, etc

Things were pretty much on a downhill slope for awhile. The number of deaths just kept skyrocketing, gas and the like made basic living difficult. My co-workers and I made contact with more and more people, and some of them began to come into Sendai as a first step towards evacuating somewhere else in Japan or out of the country for a while. Of course there were no trains, and the airport was hit by the tsunami, so there were only buses. Gathering this sort of information and letting people know what was happening (there was no English news if you were stuck in the countryside with no electricity and internet) was also our job, and we did what we could.

All the little moments I witnessed could fill a book. Seeing an evacuated man and his wife building a divider (and shelves) from cardboard between their beds (and later entertaining guests with wine, it isn’t being purified so you shouldn’t drink it (I was pretty sick with the runs for 2 days), the feeling I had when the official death count exceeded the Kobe earthquake, seeing a convoy of trucks loaded with water and food pull up two hours after my friend in the Crisis Management Division told me that they were completely out of supplies for the coastal cites (I cheered, pumped a fist in the air and ran to help unload them, marking the only time (to date) I’ve made SDF soldiers laugh), meeting with embassy officials from five different countries and assisting them in finding their citizens, available for the low price of “help us if we need it” and a lot more.

But it’s the people that stick with me the most. People who held it together in the worst, and instead of being defeated by it, pushed and fought to win back their way of living. Not to mention the (at peak) 95,000 volunteers in Miyagi alone who came from all over the world to help, despite it being the definition of a “safety not guaranteed” situation. 

That’s the biggest reason I didn’t move after I finished my job in July: I’ve lived in Miyagi for five years, and how much I wanted to…just fix it somehow. 

Given the scale of the disaster, because Miyagi deserves as much. I'd rather be here than anywhere else.

A friend of mine recently started as the only foreigner at a company, but a place that becomes your hometown - you represent it, you should be proud of it and likewise do it proud, which is why everyone makes so many personal sacrifices. But when a foreign employee joins, people are unsure about whether to treat him as a villager or a visitor. They will look to his behavior for cues about which it is. So if you don't do the same kind of sacrifice and suffering for the company, that's actually okay and doesn't mean you aren't doing your job (that's the part that surprised me). But don't expect to be promoted to town council. On the other hand, if you do start acting like a villager

The reason we want you to see this is so that you can hear the cries, and fear that is afflicting these people trapped in Minami-soma, the 30 km fallout zone near Fukushima this very second.
 
With the fear of Nuclear fallout
 
Please spread the word - help them however you can. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
There is an unknown amount of people in Minami-soma who have been advised to stay indoors. There is a hospital (Omachi Hospital - http://www.ohmachi.jp/) trapped within the fallout zone that has 180 patients

Things are getting much much better in the area where I live.

We finally ran out of food

Fortunately

 

What we still really need is gasoline.

There is no bus service available around his hometown, so Hideaki decided to be patient. It's so painful to see him worrying about them like crazy but he can't visit them.

 

Hide and I don't consider ourselves as victims aynmore.

We don't buy too much food. We save on electricity and water.

 

And I don't really care about the Fukushima nuclear plant

It's nonsense to worry too much about it because I doubt the radiation leak from the reactors harm our health.

Lot's of experts have been working hard! I believe in the professionals working on it. I hope people not in fukushima don't get freaked out by it... I'll eat food from fukushima and I'm not scared of visiting there.   I really hope Fukushima will not be hit hard by rumors.  

 

Thank you very much for trying to send me something. Everytime you asked me if there was something I need

 

Japan Post is partly in service in sendai city 

I'm afraid no couriers are available right now.. It means a lot to me you offered though!

 

.. I want to ask you a huge favor.

If you  have money to send me something

Thanks to the local people,  they started to be able to eat properly and drink gradually.  but they'll need financial aid soon.   I know some of you have already donated money. That's enormously helpful.   I'll donate money and resorces to them too.

 

I have food. I have lights and water.  I have tons of warmth from my dear friends.

I don't need anything else. 

 

Don't worry about me

Please take care

 

 

I hope I can visit you and say ""thank you"" to you in person someday.

 

Arigato!

With great care, a circus of cute and absurd, through the crowded-yet-sometimes-empty streets of Tenmonkan.


Women and men alike flock to his sideshow of pedigree fluff and sleepy yawns. The onlookers squeal like school children full of delight as they frantically pull out their cellphones to snap photos of this rare


Outside of the confines of the stroller, is this man's first and best mannered friend: Maron.


Maron is not your typical cat. Maron is bushy, and brushed to a puff, Maron is a four paw show that requires no entourage.


When the man in the dark denim jeans calls her, that she's the star. Not just the star of the show, *his* star. His best friend.


He loves all of his friends

Not too long ago, than I'm used to, and it was then that it dawned on me: I hadn't actually seen him in quite awhile.



I approached him and listened to him speak words so soft they floated away on the wind like little puffs of smoke, and looked down as if to maybe find her there once again by his leg.

Recently I have noticed more and more links to [japanCRUSH](http://www.japancrush.com/) being posted, with a particular focus on translating comments of native bloggers and message board users into English. The original and most popular of these sites was chinaSMACK, where one could access the previously untapped source of opinion of Chinese netizens. It was a huge hit with Western expats in China. Then followed koreaBANG, indoBOOM, russiaSLAM, and now japanCRUSH - using the same formula of translating native netizens’ comments into English for all to read.

Here’s the problem. This website is utter garbage. The stories are pure sensationalist drivel, usually cherry picked from right wing boards, reacting angrily, cursing foreigners and wishing deportation/punishment/death upon them. The final stage is the comment section of smack/bang/crush itself, involving defensive expats battling with English speaking trolls, usually about sleeping with native women.

http://www.koreabang.com/tag/foreigners

http://www.chinasmack.com/tag/foreigners

I think the Korean one is by far the worst

So to sum up their business model: post a bunch of inflammatory stories and inflammatory comments, which serves a dual purpose: anger the racists, and promote their other business venture, [a dating service.](http://personals.chinasmack.com/member/home.jhtml?puid=3819060)

Now japanCRUSH is still very young, I think it has the potential to become very big, and damage relations between foreigners and Japanese people. Online at least. If I had never visited Korea before, based on what I have read on koreaBANG, I would assume it was a racist hell hole where I might get lynched for holding hands with a Korean girl. Some poor soul might think the same thing about this country and think twice about coming here, or feel further stress in living here. This blogger said it better than I did.

http://eastasiastudent.net/china/problem-with-chinasmack/

Finally, or take it with a pinch of salt.

**TL;DR: japanCRUSH is part of a network that posts negative

I majored in Japanese, JLPT) before just trying to find *something,* anything, and jet over here. After working two years as an underpaid ALT, I just can't do this anymore. I've been waking up at 4am, studying from 4:30am to 6:30am, rushing to get ready for work, then collapsing in bed soon after. I took, and I'm not gonna pass. I just haven't consumed and retained enough grammar

So, in Japan. But I feel like I could have stayed in the U.S. and advanced my career. Hell, started a career by now. As we all know, teaching English in Japan is mostly a joke (outside of the respectable people who teach because they love it, and are professionals). I've been a fool these past two years. I really, really tried. I tried to become proficient. But due to my own lack of stamina, and my intellectual limitations

3. The airport's scheduled opening date of 1971 comes and goes but the government hasn't been able to get the landowners to sell. They decide to appropriate it anyway


4. Finally, there are only 2 runways, and you still have to go through a security check (or at least show your passport) before you can even enter the terminal building due to fears of terrorism that pre-date 9/11.


5. [Violent protest continues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoFM8ynyMQ&amp;t=2m05s) as late as 1985 (!). But the people in that video are old. And though security is still high


I hope I have the facts right. So here are my two questions:

1 - Wikipedia identifies the groups who protested against the airport as ""socialist"". Why would socialists fight for the right of private citizens to keep private land that would benefit the nation economically if it were used as an airport?

2 - What's with the people who have held onto the land near the airport? As the original owners have died off, in effect, wait for a generation of people to die because it will still be around and they won't?

It's been over two weeks

Monty was at Rikuzentakata when the earthquake and tsunami hit. He called his fiancee, the names for those buildings interchange, so if he told Naoko that he was at the civic center, he could have been at the city hall. Only one of those buildings were left standing.

There has been conflicting information about his post-tsunami whereabouts. Some people *may* have seen him, those people have not been heard from, either. 

Naoko biked to Rikuzentakata, I am not sure if I can believe it anymore.

I can't emphasize how heartbreaking this is. Monty has been a very prevalent person within our department at the university, sweetest, most compassionate people I know. He deserved this great opportunity to work in Japan after working his ass off for years to get there. He was orphaned as a teenager, and that only further amplified his ambitions to make his parents proud. No one deserves to die in that manner, but his family deserves to know what happened.

I'm again asking for Redditors to pass along his information. [Here](http://japan.person-finder.appspot.com/view?id=japan.person-finder.appspot.com%2Fperson.2704239&amp;lang=en&amp;query=Monty+dickson&amp;role=seek) is his missing person's page with information and photographs.

Now for the big question. Redditors in Japan, contacting various officials and consulates. Those people, in turn, can only do so much in Japan when the sat phones go down and traveling is difficult. It's been so long, and so hard to not have any news, good or bad, come from Takata..

2) You must pay a ¥9

3) Final payment can be done with a credit card or paper bill. Additionally the credit card must be the same name as the account holder. Since we closed our bank accounts in Japan and my wife has a different last name in the states than Japan she was unable to use any american credit card for this and I was not able to use my card because I was not the ""primary"" account holder.
