1336060277.0,t58cl,"People are always looking for things to do in Miami (besides, you know, the club scene). Here's a list. ",scru,150,69

Things to do if you're not a clubber

* Go watch Jai Alai and enjoy the rowdy old Cuban men yelling at the players. It's free

* Bike the 15 mile Shark Valley path

* Climb a couple walls at X-Treme Rock Climbing down south. You'll need a buddy for this.

* ~~Go join up with the anime club at FIU. They put on a totally free anime con each year called Yasumicon, and join up with the UM Anime Club for screenings on Thursday nights (thanks, Desertfox88!).

* Go check out El Palacio de los Jugos. It was featured on No Reservations for a reason.

* Take a figure drawing course at UM. It's about five bucks and you get to draw a naked person for hours. Heaps of fun!

* Do yoga in the mornings at Bay Front Park. It's free and will help to alleviate all of the pent up anger you've got about Miami.

* Outland Station ~~up in Ft. Lauderdale~~ in Kendall (thanks for the correction

* Asian events happen all the time

* Go check out all the festivals at Fairchild Tropical Gardens. The gardens are one of the cities greatest treasures. My brother works there and I'm sure he'd be thrilled to give you a tour of their acres and acres of amazing plants.

* Speaking of family, is the Director of Fundraising and loves showing people around. Their collection is totally astounding.

* Go watch a movie at O Cinema in Wynwood. They're always showing weird and obscure films (though sometimes they put on movies that everyone knows

* Join the Wynwood Art Walk for a tour of the Wynwood area. The next one is on Saturday May the 12th

* Go eat your fill at Food Truck Night. These move all around each day so you're really going to have to just Google it (like the rest of the ideas I'm giving you).

* The Goldcoast Railroad Museum down by the zoo is really worth checking out. It's recently renovated

* While you're over there

* You say you're not into sports but it's baseball season and most weekends there are three games in a row at UM. Ticket price is $10 if you're not a student

* Speaking of milkshakes

* If you're into more hardcore fare

* Go to the beach! You live in Miami! I prefer going up around Collins &amp; 69th, much easier.

* Tour the city in a whole new way during Critical Mass on the last Friday of every month. Remember to bring your bike.

* Go do a You-Pick-'Em session at one of the many amish Redlands farms. There's also a closer one over on Kendall.

* Meet up with other Redditors at Sandbar (no one says you have to drink) and do a little Trivia on a Friday night.

* Go check out the Hare Krishna temple in Coconut Grove. It's beautiful to see and sometimes they give out good free vegan food.

* Wander through Bal Harbor and pretend you can afford what the shops are offering.

* Even if you don't drink

* Ride the Metro back and forth. There's good stories in the making from that.

* Get your off road vehicle license from Big Cypress National Park. You'll watch a powerpoint and then get your photo and name on a little card that allows you to ride ATCs, and Swamp Buggies.

* Once you've done that

* Are you into comic books? There's a comic book store on Bird Rd. (probably the only one in the city) that's just totally incredible. Wall to wall boxes of old comic books and new comic books

* Got some work to do

* Via iRUVtacos

* Also from iRUVtacos

* User juniorv376 is a member of a bi-weekly GO group that is active in both Hialeah and Aventura. Bug him about it! 



For the drinkers:

* Titanic Brewery over by UM can't be overstated as my favorite place to drink in the city. They brew the best IPA I've ever had (perfectly grapefruity) and make a pulled pork sandwich to beat Shorty's.

* Mac's Club Deuce is one of the last remaining true dives on the beach. I hear it's grody -- but isn't that what you want?

* Though if we're talking dives

* Abraxas on Meridien Ave. is built into someone's bottom floor apartment. You can still smoke inside (watch out!)

* The Abbey has been around for years and they also recently renovated. Go get some traditional trappist ale in their gorgeously embiggened space.

* DRB (Democratic Republic of Beer) is a beer snob joint with a classically Miami vibe. They're a little too shiny for my taste

* WetLab is an amazing place and should be considered a treasure of the city. It's a little hard to find since it's hidden in the back of the UM Marine Biology School, this is the perfect place to watch the sunset and relax. Cash only!




Food:

* Por Fin is reopening some time soon (not sure when) and when it does you should go eat their Bunuelos de Bacalao. Perfecto!

* Mojito grill (hole in the wall Cuban joint) in South Miami makes the most perfect croquetas. The rest leaves something to be desired though.

* Versailles has okay food but it's a must for the Miami experience.

* Via Tmachine, Jalapeno Cheese grits and Collards is probably the best meal a human being can have.""

* Also re-mentioning Don Burrito -- it's the only place to get Mexican food.

* The Daily over on Biscayne Blvd is good diner food with a nice outdoor seating area. I like their breakfast burrito in particular.

* Miss Saigon on Dixie Highway makes the best Pho in the entire world. Trust me. Also

* Lan Pan Asian in Dadeland Station makes the freshest and tastiest sushi

* Whisk is the city's current baby. Nouveau Americana food to die for

* If you want pizza, probably.

* There's a little french bakery in a strip mall off of Red Rd. by Sunset Place called something like ""Le Royale

Apologies in advance for the length of this rant, so that someone will enlighten me, as I currently believe that their incompetence literally took someone's life.

I was on board a diving boat yesterday (Sunday, not including crew, to a couple of dive sites off Miami's coast. 
At the conclusion of the first dive, they realize that there is one of the scuba divers--a middle-aged woman, is missing. Her dive buddy (to those unfamiliar with diving--everyone is always assigned a partner, in case something goes wrong) says that she thought she had seen her come aboard, but evidently this wasn't the case. It happens now and then that someone gets separated from their partner--often overwhelmed by a current of something like that. There are several ""backups"" in diving for these types of issues--for instance, dives are planned so that you still have a decent amount of oxygen left in your tank by the time you're supposed to be back on the ship; we have a snorkel, so you can float on the surface and still be able to breath even if there are waves hitting you; the BCD (this is the ""vest"" that the scuba tank is actually attached to) can be inflated just like a life-vest--all so that a person can safely wait to be rescued. 

Once it was confirmed that the woman was missing, things become more serious--it's very difficult to stay afloat for an extended period of time without the BCD, and easy to succumb to exhaustion. At this point the USCG is called...

One small boat arrives about 15 minutes later. Our captain informs them about what's going on
He asks one of the USCG how they'd like to continue the search. The USCG officer looks at us with a completely blank stare, but we left to continue searching, while the USCG boat kept circling a tiny area. 

We spend the next hour with two of our divers dragging off the back of our boat
At the end of the hour, mid-20s, maybe 5' tall, we'll call her Betty) heads underwater and pulls the woman up. Betty starts swimming over to the USCG boat, but they start yelling at her, ""no, don't bring her over here! Take her to your boat!"" Betty, exhausted from being dragged behind the boat for an hour
People on our boat are yelling at them

We spend the next 35 minutes going full-speed back to port, which was at least 5 times faster than our vessel has sped past us about 8 times--they were now circling us, apparently. 

By the time we got to port

In the news today

Now

- Why did one 1 USCG boat respond? Why no helicopter? Oceans are big--and boats can only cover so much ground. Even our captain thought it was a miracle we found the woman--20 feet in either direction
- Why did the USCG refuse to take her on board? Surely they must be trained in CPR and have better medical equipment than the crew of a dive boat?
- To the point above
- Why would they lie later about arriving only after the body had been recovered?",,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/198f5u/woman_drowns_off_the_coast_of_miami_beach_coast/

What I'm not cool with are the riders who create dangerous situations by blatantly ignoring traffic laws. Almost every morning, but it is dangerous and puts a lot of unnecessary risk out there. 


So this morning I safely pass a group of 60+ bicyclists going towards the Rickenbacker causeway and come to a stop at a red light. I needed to make a right hand turn, they are yelling obscenities and hitting my car, to get my attention, I guess?  I sat there, stunned for a moment thinking about all of the ways that situation could have played out. What if any of those bicyclists crashed into my car and fell under?  


It's dangerous enough driving in Miami let alone trying to avoid bicyclists who seemingly have a death wish.  If we are all supposed to share the road

Each building ""off the chopping block"" is a homework / technology center reduced to less than half the hours you have now.  Insert a ""cadre of volunteers."" according to County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. 

Your 2013-14 taxes won't go down one nickel.  Just your services are slashed by 2/3.  What you were able to get with your library card is now reduced to less hours, less access to the building. 

Two years ago the library was financially healthy and even had a $75 million reserve while all of the other departments were $250 million in the red.  

Now, the library system is bankrupted by Mayor Gimenez. On July 10th, our Mayor and seven commissioners rushed a vote in fifteen minutes to underfund the library and voila!  251 people are targeted for layoffs and you get a shadow or ""footprint"" of what you paid for over the decades.

1347053825.0,ziyl2,Six Reasons Why (East) Little Havana is Miami's Best Place to Live.,KingWalrus00,64,28,71,"Okay

1. It's cheap.  The average price for a spacious 1/1 is around $650, and the newer ones are still *very* affordable.  But that's not even the best part.  A lot of people don't realize that leases are not only extra negotiable, but often *nonexistent* in Little Havana.  Plenty of places will allow you to just move right in without signing a thing.  You don't like it?  No pressure, no contract.

2.) It's charming.  This part of the city has true character, slugging down a quick cafecito, and taking in the sights, sounds, and scents of 8th street.  I especially love that quick whiff of tobacco leaves you get when walking past a cigar shop.  I wish I could say the same about the reggaeton blasting out of random speakers.  

3.) It's safe.  Sure it looks sketchy here and there, but those areas are far sketchier IMO.  I wouldn't suggest a solo female to walk the streets at 3 am, but that's just common sense.

4.) Calle Ocho parade.  Okay, or just enjoy the novelty, the idea of parking anywhere near Calle Ocho on this day, let alone driving, is beyond terrible.  But setting out on foot with some friends to devour arepas and get wrecked off of gasolina?  Sign me up!  Have to use the bathroom or just get away from the chongas?  Simply walk home =)  

5.) The food.  Nothing else needs to be said here.  A snapper fillet and two sides for $9?  You got it.

6.) By far the best perk on this list: it is the most conveniently central location in all of Miami!  The beach, coconut grove...they are all within 15 minutes.  Every main road is super accessible.  I-95?  Down the street.  The 836?  Down the street.  Want to head to South Miami?  US1 is down the street!!  Location, location, location.

So that's all folks.  Bitch all you want but I stand by it.  If you're new in town and want some real flavor,,False,,t5_2qi76,False,,True

I've never been to a meetup because I imagine

Nearly all of my life, went away to Florida State, came back for a job opportunity, and slowly have been going out more, exploring the city, and realising that it's on the cusp of becoming a great symbol of 21st century urbanism. It has great potential to be the flagship city of this century.

When I travel, DC, NYC, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland... no one else seems to hate their city as ardently as /r/miami does. No one can ask a question about things to do here or where to move or how to get a job without someone telling them that our city is awful, and that Miami is just a bunch of racist Cuban pricks living in bad neighbourhoods. It really boggles my mind to imagine why anyone would still subscribe with so much hate for the city. The negativity oozes out of you. God forbid someone mention Hialeah

Why is this such a popular thing?

I grew up and live in Hialeah. It's not a great place, or Kendall.

There's good Cuban food everywhere, Hialeah Senior High got more kids into Ivy League and top-ranked schools than any *magnet* school in Miami).

The cops suck, like they are from here to Florida City.

You complain about our streets. The same streets that are on the same type of grid system as the county, and you have no real reason to complain. Homestead, Miami Lakes, Opa-Locka, and Florida City all have their own grid system, but I never hear it about them.

A lot more people here know Spanish than I think it's assumed. If you walk into any bank, most people will know enough English to help you or have someone to help, if they're not fully fluent themselves. I've gone out with plenty of 'white' friends here and I've never seen them, us, or anyone get bad service just because the Spanish wasn't great.

So what gives? Most of the reasons to hate Hialeah are blown wildly out of proportion. Do you guys just hate on us for the sake of hating on us?",,t5_2qi76,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1awxbj/lets_talk_about_hialeah/

Initially I was somewhat on the fence about the libraries that are slated to close.  It's true that I don't use the libraries as much as I did growing up in the 1980's and 90's.  The Internet has changed my reading habits.

But I was thinking about the loss of public spaces and I think the libraries are worth saving.  Little kids still go to book readings.  I am signed up for a free Saturday native landscaping course at the West Kendall branch.  

The comments on the Herald focus on the fact that many homeless people use libraries.  I've read nasty quips about the homeless enjoying the ""free air conditioning.""  If we close the libraries it doesn't solve the homeless problem.

I’m a 25 year old male grad student from Munich/Germany and I’m moving to Miami in August to start a MBA at FIU. I have no idea what I’m getting myself into. 


I’ve been subscribed to this subreddit for quite a while, drivers are loose cannons, traffic is hell, public transportation almost non-existent and finding an apartment tough. Also, people are obnoxious.


Anyway


So


1. The discussions on this subreddit have given me the impression that Coconut Grove, most ads on Craigslist are very vague to say the least and people seem to care very little about who they live with. Are there any better websites that i should look into?
Another option for me would be to look for a condo or efficiency in cheaper neighborhoods such as Little Havanna. I’ve lived in Medellín/Colombia and other Latin American countries and speak Spanish fluently. I’ve never had bigger problems in Latin America and have mostly felt safe


2. Unfortunately I don’t have a driver’s license. I could either try to get a license or find a way to somehow get along without a car. 
Getting a driver’s license in Germany would cost me more than 2000$ so now I’m considering getting it in Miami. The rants about Miami drivers in this subreddit make me wonder how difficult and cheap it can be to get one? Is it true that you need your own car for the practical driving test and if so


3. In Germany I live comfortably off about 1000$/month (plus rent). I go out quite a lot and like to eat out once in a while. I go to concerts


4. Miami is often described as a very superficial, philosophically and politically interested person. I enjoy indie, punk and DIY concerts, I like run-down bars, underground techno parties, bookstores, political discussions and independent cinema. I know, but well

I gotta say, and have given awesome guides for those coming to your beautiful city! 

Out of inspiration and slight boredom

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**
Great weather (duh)
Friendly locals and helpful public employees
Absolutely horrendous public transportation
Extremely accessible and diverse beyond belief

So here's a little breakdown of how our first day went: 

We arrived in Ft. Lauderdale and took the shuttle to the Tri-Rail, it took almost an equal amount in hours. That was rough on the morale considering we were on spring break!

We stayed at the [Majestic](http://www.majesticsouthbeach.com/) hotel on 7th and Ocean. Yes I know

**Beach Life**
The weekend was DRASTICALLY different than the weekdays. Locals swarmed [Lummus Park Beach](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lummus-park-on-south-beach-miami-beach) on the weekend

Cops were an enormous pain in the ass. They were like flies

Bottom line

**Night Life**
Bracelets bracelets bracelets! Holy god

We were only two blocks from [Clevelander](http://www.clevelander.com/) and my buds and I agreed that it was the most well-rounded club. It is outdoors, but that's what pregaming is for! I met some awesome girls and it was super convenient to the hotel. ;)

In second comes the package deal from [Catalina](http://catalinahotel.com/) hotel. For 20 bucks each, and free entry to NB. Suffice to say I got demolished at Catalina and vaguely remember the bus ride or even taking a girl out to the beach and having some fun.

**Food**
Spaghetto (I can't find any links online). For the love of god, and a drink. Fantastic deal IMHO. It's located on Washington between 5th and 6th if my memory serves me correct.

[Tap-Tap](http://www.southbeach-usa.com/restaurants/misc/tap-tap/tap-tap.htm). Fantastic Haitian food but jesus christ it was the slowest service I have ever encountered. I got the Tilapia

[Pizza Rustica](http://www.pizza-rustica.com/). I know it's a chain of sorts

**Shopping**
Don't waste your time. I love clothes, Quicksilver, Urban Outfitters, Benetton). 

I do recommend, relaxing, and pretty damn easy on the eyes too.

**REGRETS**
Not visiting the Keys. I got some [very sage advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ps0w6/car_rentals_for_a_day/) on car rentals from you fine folks and I never even followed through. It was a mixture of laziness and time constraints. But damn

Not spending enough time in actual Miami. The lack of a car was tough. Having homebody friends who only want to drink and sit on the beach? Makes it even harder. Get to Miami! Do it for me!

**Pros**
Clubs and partying is accessible every hour of every day. We got home at 6 a.m. one day!
Girls girls girls. Need I say more?
Pristine oceans and easy access from hotels.
Food from every corner of the earth everywhere you go!
Locals are extremely friendly and helpful.
Miami Heat game was only 20 bucks a pop and we got great seats. Who would have thought!?

**Cons**
Prices are obnoxious. But come on
Clubs can be extremely hit-or-miss and racially quarantined. 
Hotel-front restaurant venders are a fucking nuisance. You learn to just ignore them.

I'm not really into the clubbing scene, even if it's something as simple as grabbing food at Cici's, shopping at Westland, or catching a matinée at the Muvico nearby - I believe it even has an arcade now. Maybe we could even start an informal organization that meets up from time to time for board games or cafe con leche. Nothing over-the-top - I imagine a lot of you who live here aren't really out of the closet, and I don't blame you.

If you're queer, leave a comment and make yourself visible. I know I can't be the only gay guy in Hialeah that isn't into Miami's nightlife. A lot of us probably don't really appreciate Hialeah, but I bet meeting other people would help us foster some greater sense of belonging and community here. And who knows? Maybe there are some places nearby you'd enjoy but have never heard about. 

Anyone here?

Art ranges from jewelry to fine art and takes a variety of forms, including sculptures. You can explore the area with a map, popping in any gallery you choose, or take a trolley to save some time.

I would like to start at the Books &amp; Books (they have a nice selection of craft beers) on 265 Aragon Avenue at 7pm for a little pre-gaming. No, I will post my phone number &amp; some more info (if anyone actually shows interest in going, that is). So what do you say, r/Miami?

I've got a couple ideas but I would love to hear from the community. The plan is to kind of keep the distances equal between Miami and Ft Lauderdale so we don't have people driving up from Miami Beach or Kendall area to go to Las Olas and vice versa.

It would be taking place on Reddit Meetup Day

As soon as we have all the entries for locations, we will be able to plan for the absence.

I will be creating a separate thread tonight to be the voting/planning thread. 

So far these places have been thrown out. Each park has link describing features and activities found at said park:

* 
Dave and Busters - Fun as shit. Plenty of games, and beer. A little something for everyone.

* 
Wood Tavern - I've got two people so far vouching for this venue. Seems like a chill down to earth bar. Would be a nice place to go for those redditors that had to work if we choose to have the meeting during the day.

* 
Oleta Park - This was just recently thrown in and after looking on the map it is the only park brought up so far that would be fair to both Miami and Ft. Lauderdale.
[Info on Oleta Park](http://www.floridastateparks.org/oletariver/)

              -For those of you in Ft. Lauderdale
              -For those of you in Miami and surrounding areas it goes as such:
                      South Beach and surrounding areas: 35min up A1A or 25min up I-95 w/o traffic
                      Kendall and surrounding areas: 45min straight shot up the Palmetto
                      Miramar/Pembroke Pines/Davie: 25-35min dependent on location
                                     

* 
Crandon Park - Two people vouching for this venue. Apparently this is where last years meetup was held. Scru made a good point that it would allow the under 21 crew to join in on the meetup and then for those of you who couldn't make it too the beach due to work or other constraints
[Info on Crandon Park](http://www.miamiandbeaches.com/crandon_park_beach.asp)

* 
Markham Park - Another excellent spot with jet ski rentals, and even the possibility of a bounce house lol. [Info on Markham Park](http://www.broward.org/parks/markhampark/Pages/Default.aspx)

*

For a while now there have been plans to remove my father from the household

My elder brother lives nearby and may be able to take in one of them; also my elder sister also lives in Miami and could take in a couple of them. However, at least two. I currently live in a studio/efficiency in what is called the ""apartments"" of the University dorms. It is very liberal here, meaning that if I took in a kid or two, if they make no ruckus, nobody here would notice or even care. However, that does not mean that the case worker will let them stay with me.

The end of the first summer semester ends in a couple of days. I am planning to withdraw from the university dorms and live off-campus. However

I am looking for a place close to FIU, but an efficiency/studio is okay too. I can't afford much more than $1050 a month, although ideally speaking I would like it around $800. A place with utilities included in the rent would be great. I can't have a place without a stove, as I would obviously need to cook for them. A/C is a must, and if there were a washer/dryer within the community that would be fantastic.

This is me with the two youngest: http://i.imgur.com/XHexF.jpg

1332019007.0,r18g4,Warning: SmartPhone Clinic,magically_malicious,20,2,18,"I will tell you all a tale of the WORST retail experience I have ever had. This happened over the last few months and just kind of exploded today.
I took my PS3 for repair at The SmartPhone Clinic in Plantation, connected to the internet, did everything, it was just a minor pixel issue with 3D models. Since I had the extra money, I figured I would get it taken care of. I dropped it off on January 17, they said it was my graphics chip. They said they fixed it, called me up and said it was ready to go. I came and picked up up on Jan 31.
I took it home, so I did. When I got in this time, there was a different technician, I told him what the problem was and he said ""Oh yeah, we have had some of those come back, we got some local cheap American graphics chips that are failing and we are waiting for a shipment of good Chinese chips"". I said fine, I just want it repaired.

So weeks go by

I called the next day, he said the next day (Saturday) and then I asked about a refund, he said he wasnt sure I was entitled to one but I would have to speak to someone at the store.

I tried calling on Saturday to see if my PS3 was in, I said I was coming to get it and I asked about the refund, luckily they agreed to give me a full refund.
When I got there, they matched up. I asked about it and they said they must have forgot to put it back on and asked if I can come back in a few days to get it. I informed them that this was by far the worst experience I have had with any service company. They apologized. I got my refund, and they said they hoped I would still consider doing business with them. I left with my PS3.

I get home and go to turn it on and it is not getting any power. NO POWER. I gave it to them 98% functional except a minor annoying graphics glitch and they gave it back to me completely broken. I called up the repair center. The ""head tech"" barely let me get a word in. I was crying on the phone. Finally I yelled and said it would be nice if he would let me finish my sentences. He told me that the first time they gave it to me (Jan 31) they actually forgot to repair it. He said he was sorry but it was going to eventually die anyway. He said he couldnt do anything about it.
I got my PS3 back in far worse condition than when I sought their help originally.
https://www.facebook.com/TheSmartPhoneClinic

TL;DR sent my PS3 in for a nosejob and got a corpse in return two months later.

EDIT:  I would also like to make it clear, when it wasn't even opened up) I never once got a phone call back. I was never told that it was now 100% broken, I didn't find out until I got home. Parts were missing from my ps3 when I got it back. When I called and shared my concern, instead of having a system in place for the rare occasion this happens (I was told about 1% of the time), I was giving the big fuck you and told ""your ps3 was going to break eventually anyway"". I was crying on the phone from frustration and then told ""I hope you will still use us in the future"".",,False,t5_2qi76,True

Here's an excerpt from the FDOT site on pedestrian laws:  ‎"" A pedestrian who sets foot in a (marked or unmarked) crosswalk where traffic signals are not in place, so long as it is feasible for the driver to do so. The driver's duty to yield applies regardless of whether the crossing location is controlled by any signs (Stop or Yield). Yielding may take the form of slowing or stopping; safe yielding requires stopping (and waiting) if the crossing pedestrian is in the driver's lane, in the lane into which the driver is turning, or in an adjoining lane.""

**Round Two:**  Looks like the majority of people are interested in a Saturday the 10th morning ride.  What I thought would work best would be a 10:00 to 11:00 AM meet up time at the first parking lot (or more likely directly across from it in the picnic area) of Matheson Hammock.  At 11, and have us taking paths north to the grove and then circling around and taking the M Path back to Matheson Hammock.  From there we can commence with the beer and food (which was presumably left in coolers in our cars)!

**Original Message:**  Wanted to see if there was any interest for a group bike ride, I don't think that's a good idea.  For this reason, we would probably be sticking to some of the area bike paths.  If we go Friday, maybe we can end up at a bar for some beers? Alternately, we could finish up a Saturday ride at Matheson Hammock for a picnic? ",,False,t5_2qi76,True

About the place, self parking, utilities, etc.) it'll come out to $1,100 a month each. They also said that they're going to be leaving some furniture behind including big ticket items like one or two beds, table, etc. so overall it's a good deal.

About myself, graduated in the spring, been in Miami since September. Work full time, 8:30-6:30 typically during the week. Like to go out on the weekend. Overall I'm a laid back guy.

If you're interested let me know! I figured I would try here before posting an ad on craigslist because I would rather live with another redditor than some sketch off craigslist.
