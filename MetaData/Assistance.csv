As soon as I heard of Karen Huff Klein and what some condom worthy offspring have done to her

Lets give Karen a vacation of a lifetime

I have just created a fundraiser page for Karen:

http://www.indiegogo.com/loveforkarenhklein?a=714358

I have contacted her through Facebook

If someone can let her know or send me her email so I can forward all the logins and details to her that would be great!

Details:

The video above shows the 68 year old bus monitor named Karen Klein being verbally abused by a group of condom worthy middle schoolers from Athena Middle School in Greece

Through the video you can hear them verbally berating the woman, poor, ugly, and various other words of the like. At one point in the video, you can hear one of the kids yell, “You’re so fuckin poor you fat ass,” in which Karen responds, I try and it’s really hard, something that will bring some joy to her life.

She doesn't earn nearly enough ($15

My name is Michael West, and moved to Denver with his wife Katie for better job opportunities and to have better chances of making it big as a professional standup comedian. Katie, who I have known since I was 4 years old, is well on her way to being a veterinarian technician like she has always wanted. She is currently still in her program, but should be graduating in 1 ½ years. Caleb and Katie started dating in high school in their senior year October 31st, 2007 and got married October 31st, 2010 up in the mountains with only family and close friends. I was one of Caleb’s grooms’ men, you could just tell that out of everyone in the world, and they would be happily married for eternity. They have been inseparable since that beautiful morning in the mountains, they found the name from the guy from Lost
 
On Thursday night, and sat within 15 feet of the emergency exit where the shooter entered. About 15 minutes into the movie, the terrorist came in and “did what he came to do” according to CNN. Katie told me he came in through the emergency exit at the bottom right of the theater, and threw something over their heads. “I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene.” Katie told me. “Then he opened fire, and Caleb was shot in the right eye as they all tried to duck in cover. “I thought he was dead, because there was so much blood, and he kept running his fingers through his hair.” Katie and her friend Ashley were staying down right next to Caleb until the shooter left the theater. Within minutes the police was taking people out of the theater, and I did not find out if he was still alive until they released me at about 4 am.

Caleb is now in the ICU, and is fighting for his life. He has been to surgery twice already, has received over 4 liters of blood, and must go back to get his right eye removed and the pellets from the shot gun removed. Caleb is a friend, a husband, a son, and about to be a father. Caleb and his family have no insurance, to please do so for these marvelous people that do not deserve any of this that happened to them. If you cannot donate, and ask any questions

I don't personally know her Dad, her spine will revert to 55 degrees from the 35 degrees it is currently at.

Thank you....Javacat

&gt;My 3 years old daughter is fighting Progressive Infantile Scoliosis and we are making it together! We found a treatment called Mehta Casting (w/no surgery). A nice doctor from Mayo Clinic took us there for a 1 time application (she needs 4 more) and her spine curvature was reduced from 50° to 35° and she is doing a lot of progress.

&gt;We sent her doctor to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital to be trained by Dr Peter Sturm (another successful experience) and we are working really hard to bring this life saving technique to our country ""Peru"" and all we need now is to buy the special frame that is made in the US.

&gt;We have set up a Paypal account to receive donations. Once we reach our goal (USD 12

&gt;Mehta Casting has the real potential to save children life...the same way it is doing it now with Sofía.

&gt;We just need that extra push to achieve our goal....You can help Sofía and kids in our community.

Sofia needs her next treatment by March 15th.  If she can't have the treatment,415 and only need $11,085 to pay for casting equipment.  Once it's paid for, it should arrive in Peru within 30 days.

what had happened was ... A ""friend"" is a sculpture and had some pretty cool sculptures ...  I told him i could help him and had some ideas ... Thinking i would just help a friend that was my motivation ... I spent a day with him planing out how i would do it and studied his sculpture ... he told me when we do the real shoot he could have people help us ...  

time passed ..  i kept trying to get in-touch with him ...  and yet never seemed to meet up ...

so i am mostly unemployed right now ... and was doing lots of stuff for a close friend not the the fliped me the finger .. there was trade involved but being a little depressed i was feeling a little used .. but i was ok ...  the morning after i finished that job i saw on my face book page where my so called freind had a vidio of his photo shoot of his sculptures ... it was in the excat location i had taken him and in the same lighting i had said we would shoot in .. HE totally used every thing i said and every thing i would do but he cut me out ... I am sure he seemed like a fucking genius to all the people he had helping ... but the core idea and how to do it was me .. It is something i can not get back nor really claim but it was me... I felt so used ... i know this does not fit what some people were thinking ... but i got used and it hurt me so deep i can not explain ... i was hoping when i helped him i could expand my circle of friends .. but nope he is the sort of fellow to take from you and show others how great he is ... fuck him ... if yall are wonding what i do .. i am a photographer here is a photo i did for /r/trees a long while back .. http://imgur.com/a/O7Y0D",,t5_2s25d,1361487705.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/18wbif/self_post_i_feel_very_used_and_thrown_away/

There are repairs
 

This is a 3 bedroom 1.5 bathroom townhouse.


Work that needs to be done:


* Cleaning; not only is there smoke damage from her chain smoking in the house but it’s also fairly cluttered
* Wash the walls and ceilings in preparation for painting.
* Moving of furniture for the preparation of painting.
* Installing of laminate flooring tiles on the 2nd floor and stair way.
* Cleaning of furniture
* Priming and painting the walls.
 
I have 2.5 days to get this work done on the **August long weekend (Aug 3-6th)** as it’s the only time I can get off of my job and travel to Vernon BC from Victoria BC where I live.

I currently have 4 people traveling with me that weekend to do all of the work stated above
 
**I’ll accept any and all offered help.**


* Live close by or willing to travel? I’d love the extra hands. I can feed people for the weekend.
* Donations. I can’t afford to pay anyone back, painting and repairs.
* Upvotes! They help too! If I raise more than that
* Suggestions! Do you know of resources we can tap to get the help we need? Ideas? Tutorials on how to best get the job done for a bunch of amateurs?
* Seriously anything

A 91-year-old man wants to stop his daughter from evicting him from the home he built 56 years ago in Zaleski
In 2004, gave the general power of attorney to his daughter for future matters if they declined in health, including to take care of her autistic adult brother, now 63.
But unbeknownst to Potter, Jaclyn Fraley, now 35.
Potter, arguing that his daughter had transferred the deed to herself illegally because those with the power of attorney are not permitted to transfer assets to themselves from the estate they oversee.
Potter won in Vinton County Court
Early this year, during which the judge will have no choice but to evict Potter, Fraley told ABC News.

OK. Saturday morning a kid I took under my wing through coaching him in baseball because of his shitty home life. His hous caught fire and is completely gone on Saturday morning (News link below). This kid has seen tragedy after tragedy man. He is a smart kid and deserves so much better. I just got off the phone with his mom, his tv, all of his baseball gear, his game collection and his collection of cards just to mention a few. He is a kid man. So here I am reaching out to anyone and everyone. Notice I am not using a throwaway for validity reasons. I would like this to get visibility. Any ideas or cross posts. I want to help him out as much as I can. I can ensure you, he will make a video thanking everyone and everything will be going to him. Please help me help this poor kid. I have all of his sizes and such if needed. PLEASE REDDIT COME THROUGH FOR THIS KID!!!

  * UPDATE: I just walked in the door, you know why? Because we are human beings, and when one of us needs help we should do our best to try and help, even if it is encouragement or words. That is what we are supposed to do. THANKYOU GUYS!! Talk to you soon. 

  * UPDATE: I just got into work and I will be able to go through Reddit. Last night we were very busy. 2 kids had games, I would like to say a big heart felt thank you. The response so far has been overwhelming. We will go through and answer each and everyone of these.

  * UPDATE: Sorry it has been a day. We were extremely busy yesterday. I am reaching out to community resources as well, I did not know what to do, so I did the one thing I know, Reddit. There is a reason I used all my real information and not some throwaway. If you look through this thread and look at a link or 2 I posted, it will not be too hard to figure out my real information. Google the hell out of me, I have not been shy about leaving a foot print. But just understand I am trying to do something good here. By the way he is 13 (he just says hes 14 because his bday is in July. To answer some emails and such I have gotten this. ""Why are you doing this, what do you get out of it""? I hit on this before. You know when you see a car broken down at an intersection, you know that one guy, that's me. I see someone down I help them out. If I se someone getting bullied or taken advantage of
 Another reason. I had an alcoholic lush of a mom who walked out on me when I was 6, I moved to the UP to try and finish high school. As I remember parents weren't so understanding and were not fast to accept me. I was staying in garages, sneaking in windows, all so I could go to high school every day. I have had nothing in my life handed to me. I lied when I was 16 so I could work nights at the foundry, yes at 16. It was then I realized I had this skill nobody else really had, I could rock a computer, it just all mad sense. So that's how I made myself. My wife and I do NOTHING on credit (Probably really cause we couldn't get it if we wanted as that all went to hell in my twenties when I was trying to survive). MY Mom did eventually come back and we made a menz when I was 17, I would go years with out seeing him. I did not even visit him on his death bed, maybe this kid just has something special and deserves so much more. Google me to hell Mike Slomanski. 

With all that said here is what we received so far from Reddit: 
* Dominos Gift Card from AstroZombie138 (Thank you so much


I know we have gotten offers, Like most of you we live pay check to paycheck, which we are between atm. So picking stuff up is very hard, I will try to arrange a day this week. I am open to suggestions. I am open to people stopping by to meet him personally. We are a close family, I have 4 kids of my own. We have normal family problems, for those who google mapped me, I RENT, as a matter of fact I think I am behind on every bill. Again we do not do credit

What we got from Neighbors and me:
* I got him a futon and air mattress to sleep on
* An old CRT 24"" TV I picked up at a rummage
* 1 pack of boxer briefs 
* 1 Pack of socks
* A Pair of shoes 1 size too big
* A neighbor gave him $50.00
* A bicycle I fixed that was laying around.

  Now as you can all see, but that is yet to be seen or known.  
 Of course I know how generous Reddit could be, he did manage to get his baseball gear, it was in my trunk the entire time. Another question I get asked, does he have his own room? Yes, and he needs his own space. I have given him structure and set expectations, he seems to like that.

What could he use: 
* Teenage boy stuff, he like to go out and be active 
* Toiletries (You know like Axe, shampoo) 
* He could use a pair of shoes that fit (10) 
* Sizes are 32x32
* Clothes are always good * Games
* He loves baseball 
* I really want him to play RISK
* I know he doesn't need it
* Like I said I live paycheck to paycheck and now have a family of 7, gas card, electric cards are a big help at the moment (I always give back) In lieu of cash I would ask you send him gift cards or something, although I guess cash couldn't hurt, I just don't want to see him sneaking it to his Mom. * Anything else you can think of for a 14 yo boy (He finally told me yesterday (I am 13, I turn 14 in July, I just say I am 14) * I have an old ass XBOX but it has the Red Ring, if anyone knows how to fix it

I do not want to put a picture

Again My Name is Mike Slomanski, I do not care, nor do I have anything to hide. I am trying to do what is right and what I would hope anyone else would do. 

If you want my addy or phone number just message me or hit me on FB. Thanks again everyone

Given it’s rarity, the funding for any kind of research into this is limited, to say the least. The cureangelman.org foundation is almost entirely privately funded with every dollar going to the search for a cure or therapy for children like Casey. It’s a rare condition, but it’s a devastating one that, apparently, has a real shot at being cured.

If you’re interested in seeing why this is different than other similar-type disorders such as autism and cerebral palsy

http://cureangelman.org/what-hope.html

One of the most prominent symptoms of Angelman Syndrome is the disposition of the child. Given a general lack of development and understanding, drink, or even if something has startled or terrified him.

So again, and FAST is currently around 6th or 7th. I know we hate letting Facebook apps into our FB ecosystem, but it’s for a really good cause. If, and when a cure is found and by some profound miracle I’m able to hear the voice of my Casey, I’ll post as many videos as you want of him saying whatever comes to the Reddit hivemind. I have a three year old right now, actually, who’ll do that for you now if it’ll help to motivate.

Here’s the link to vote:

Thanks Reddit, hope, mobility and a life back to this community. Conversely, if you have any questions that you’d like to ask me about Angelman Syndrome, I’m happy to share what I’ve amassed over the last few days as far as knowledge goes. And since I know Reddit is chock full of science-y types, I’d be really happy to hear from anybody with a better understanding of what’s going on in the research world.

1307512736.0,huemy,I lost my two-month old son-- a plea for help.,alkalinearmies,131,28,43,"I've been a long time Reddit lurker

Being the type of person I am, I'm desperate and I don't know what else to do.

Ten days ago my beautiful two-month old son passed away.  He had awoke around 6am hungry and my girlfriend got up to feed him.  She laid down on the couch while feeding him as she had done hundreds of times before and fell asleep.  At some point between then and 10am he somehow got lodged between her and the couch and suffocated.  I'll never be able to get the image out of my head of when she woke me up screaming ""He's not breathing!"" as she held our lifeless son.

There's not one day that has gone by since that I've been able to sleep soundly.  I lay there in the dark and think about him and how much I love and miss him and just cry.  It seems every hour or two I wake up thinking I hear him crying only to remember that he's gone.

We knew a friend who had lost a baby as well who recommended that we go to a local funeral home because she knew we had no money and she told us that she had been in the same position and the funeral home worked with her and she was able to have a beautiful service and they charged her nothing.  When we told them the same, I'm not sure why they helped our friend and not us.

No one in my family has any money.  The funeral home told us if we paid a $500 deposit

Unfortunately, not only did we not qualify for $750, we didn't qualify for ANY assistance.

I support myself, utilities, gas, car payment, etc. I have little to no money left every month.  My girlfriend has been trying to find a part-time job.  She actually got one at the Goodwill just before our son passed, but it's hard because we can barely even afford for her to work because child care is so expensive.

I now owe $750 to the funeral home.  What makes it even harder is that our baby boy doesn't even have his name on his grave.  Whenever I go to visit him

If anyone is able to offer any financial assistance or assistance of any other type, beautiful boy and I want his resting place to reflect that.

This was very hard for me to write

I'm sure many of you may be doubtful of whether I'm being truthful about this and I don't blame you.  I'm generally a very skeptical person as well.  I have plenty of ways to prove I'm telling the truth, that would be wonderful.

I know how great of a community Reddit is from my time here and I want to thank you.  Even if no one is able to help

Now she is going through one final obstacle in her life, but the point is that as a result of this, her kidneys failed in September 2011.

Since then, I've gone into my savings until I've gone broke. My father has gone into his until he has gone broke: and he's working 16 hour days, six days a week. And remember my mom has health care. This is what health care in this country looks like even when you have health care! It's not for lack of worth ethic.

We're drowning. We have nothing left to give

Right now my mom is on the brutal three-times-per-week dialysis, depressed, barely-functioning zombie when she comes off. She basically is dead to the world every day, and it's killing her. Gone is her smile and that fortitude of will that has anchored this family.

She was told she was the ""perfect candidate"" for dialysis @ home, allow her to function somewhat in the last days of her life and basically have some quality of life. It's all she wants, and I can't think of anyone who deserves it more.

So they said she could go on it, but even if in the end eventually she gets covered, the deductibles and medical expenses keep adding up, and there's no way we can cover it anymore without going into financial ruin for everyone in the family. We're already teetering on the edge.

As a result, and as a son I feel desperate to try to make her happy again. 

We're having a fundraiser to try to cover her medical expenses.  Helping her live these last days with some measure of relative peace is the least I can try to do for her.

We have kept in touch since. Here's the reason I'm writing you:

She is 26yrs old now, a skin graft, physical therapy, medication... These things are not affordable or available where she lives. I have been trying to fundraise to fly her over here but as a college student working and paying my own bills, it is proving much more difficult than I'd imagined. She is part of our family. Her entire family died in a car accident 2 years before I met her. She was the only survivor. My mom, brother (fellow redditor) and grandmother are all in constant contact (we pay for her cell phone).

If she could just get here, pictures, and Emails for proof. She's receiving some care, but it's sub-par to say the least. Also, fighting off infections is nearly impossible when her only access to clean water is from a water bottle.

Please, thoughts, ideas. I don't know where else to turn.

I did finally hook up with some family last night but I felt out of place there and came back home awhile ago. But my mom isn't here and I can't keep it together. This is my second night with no sleep because when I start to doze all I see is her dead body or pieces of corpses--and I panic. (I did try lorazepam

I'm also broke with health problems and have now lost my ""work"". I'm gonna have to leave this house very soon. Which all sucks...but is nothing compared to how I truly wish she were here.

I dunno what I'm asking for. Somebody please help me get through this night. It's like the day my mom died just can't end and I feel like I'm going crazy. I guess any conversation would be good. Advice. Distractions. Any links to interesting games or recommendations on movies to stream? Any encouragement? Actually

It hurt me so badly to see her like this and has prompted me to act. What else can I do to get her some help? We've gone all the typical routes with no results. I recently got her covered under my dental insurance through my job but we are still completely unable to pay for the cost of the full mouth reconstruction she is going to need. Any help/advice will be welcome. Below is a copy of the letter she sent. What I have not posted here that was included was a picture of her smiling. I don't think she would agree to let me post the image and I will do so

&gt;My name is *Redditors Wife*. I am 25 year old stay at home mother of a beautiful 1 year old little boy. I live in and grew up in XXXXX

&gt;Even as child I was constantly in pain from my teeth. My family has always been very poor and could never afford to take me to the dentist unless it was an absolute emergency. By the age 15 I had at least 10 abscessed teeth and 4 root canals. I can actually remember a time when I was 5 or 6 when I had a molar rot so bad that there was only a sliver of it sticking out of my gums. Let’s just say the tooth fairy didn’t come to see me for that tooth. My parents were young and they didn’t instill in me how important taking care of your teeth was. I never remember them telling me to brush my teeth. And I never remember drinking anything besides soda. I was constantly picked on at school for my teeth. It didn’t help that I had huge gaps because for whatever reason my laterals on top and bottom didn’t come back after I lost my baby teeth. So I was left with huge gaps. I begged and begged my parents for braces. I prayed to God every night and even asked Santa for my teeth to be fixed instead of toys for years and years. Finally my dad found a dental school that would do braces for a very low cost. I got my braces and I thought my prayers were answered but the braces turned out to actually make things worse. After 2 years they took them off and when they did
&gt;
After I graduated high school I was too afraid to go to college because of my teeth. I’ve put a hold my dreams because of my fear of being judged or laughed at. I really want to go to college and become a High School Biology teacher. But let’s be honest, I feel disgusting, I feel unworthy. I don’t speak in public unless it’s absolutely necessary. People think I’m rude, but really I’m just embarrassed to be me. 
&gt;
I wake up and go to sleep in constant pain daily. I can’t eat certain foods because I’m missing those laterals. I’ve never been able to eat corn on the cob, drink alcohol or soda. 
&gt;
Not only would getting my teeth fixed be good for my health

'

So my absolutely delightful grandma will be turning 93 in July
This woman is incredible - she ran away from home in Poland as a teen, and when the doctor found out she was punished and sent to a work camp. After her camp was liberated by the American troops she met my grandpa, a young American soldier who asked a woman with no teeth, no English, and a child out of wedlock to marry him and long story short, she did just that. Her ornate wedding dress was made by hand by other kind strangers in the Displaced Persons camp she was in.


She came to the US, drive, and had another daughter (my mom). So the thing is, have a really small family, and my mom recently quit her job to move there and take care of my grandma who has lived alone for almost thirty years since my grandpa died. But since my mom is out there, I'm the only family out of state, and the only family to send her cards. We're not sure she's going to make it to her birthday in July and I was thinking how nice it would be to be able to send her a giant box of cards with some nice words or an early birthday wish. If you have an extra $0.45 to spare and a few minutes to doodle a card and maybe say where you live I really think it would mean a lot to her.

(She likes birds, dancing to Polka music, coffee, teaching me bad words and pick-up lines in Polish, and being sassy...)

And so you know it's real- *http://imgur.com/9x2c1

Hey Reddit!! So after a couple weeks, Ireland, and everywhere in between. 

I'll be sending out what I've got tomorrow in a plain box (she thinks she's just getting some Vivace coffee beans from me.) And in a couple weeks I'll send another box since I know cards got sent late or are still coming from thousands of miles away. 

It's been really surreal to see this type of kindness and I really really appreciate every hello that you sent. My goal with all of this was to put a smile on her face and make her feel connected to the world at a time when time running out can make you feel pretty alone. So thanks again for helping me make sure she knows that even in this big world

Introducing JackFM,000 to the winner of their competition, vincent and kerrie have entered and are now through to the final round of the competition amongst 6 other couples, in order to win, they are having to advertise JackFM in any way possible, each varied way gives them a number of points, when the competition ends on the 27th june 2012, wins the wedding, and every like per picture, if any of you could take the time to like the below page

I found a position in Manchester, New Hampshire, not exactly ideal, but a step in the right direction for sure. the job starts on November 5th, was coming to an end, and start this new position on the 5th of next month.

So with my last paycheck in hand, and had a few hundred dollars left over for fuel for the trip up the east coast. Between driving and resting it took me about 24 hours to make a trip from North Carolina to northeastern Massachusetts. My wife had told me before I left, that it was going to be a tight fit in her mother's house with all of us staying there. As it was, my wife and son were only supposed to be there visiting while she tried to get her mother some help. About 6 hours before my trip ended, my wife called to tell me that her mother felt there wasn't enough room for me to stay with all of them. It's a 2 bedroom house, and staying in the same bedroom as my wife and son, shouldn't have been a problem. That said, and I suddenly found myself without a place to stay. I begged and pleaded with her mother - even offered my last $100

That first night here in Mass, or they didn't have the room. I suppose that if I was in my early twenties, that I might have a little bit better luck, and I might also have a larger circle of friends. I know that when I was at that age, plenty of friends spent many moons on my couches. There isn't however, a lot of sympathy for guys my age, that just shouldn't be in this position. 

So, that can't let me stay with him, has provided me with a few dinners, and has let me shower at his place. 

I need a couch to sleep on, have a laptop that I can use to do any work on, at the moment. My desktop PC is of no use, because I have nowhere to set it up, nor plug it in, for that matter. I thought of taking that computer to a pawn shop, but I don't that PC myself, or software built, to anyones delight

If anyone has a place that I can stay, and for that matter, I haven't had a drink in almost two years. It's just not my thing.

Aside from that, made too much last year, and we were denied for cash assistance, nor housing assistance. She and the baby, however, did qualify for food stamps, and to my surprise medical care assistance, well I get myself back on my feet. It's getting through the next 3 weeks a cell that is going to be the problem for me

Reddit, and I've seen that some people have gone as far as making an Amazon or Walmart wish list, so that others can pick out items for them to buy. I'm not looking for someone to fill a grocery cart for me, I just need to make it through the next few weeks. The plan is to get the first paycheck, and check myself into a hotel or motel, where I can at least have a room, and a bed. If I can somehow make it that far, I'm just asking for a couch

I can provide whatever proof that I can, but I am a useless father and husband right now, and that's the part that really hurts.

As I said, but know someone who does, I would love to talk to that person. 

I'm typically way too proud to ask for help, and I'll be spending the night again in the car.

Before this realization i lived a very inactive life, if i had to go anywhere important i got driven by my friends or my mom, i ate a big bag of potato chips each day, i ate mostly white bread, pizzas, burgers and much more.

But this is now over, no more chips, no more white bread - and I've had 1 pizza and 1 burger since then (on 2 special occasions) i eat fruit every day, i switched to rye bread, i make smoothies instead of buying a bag of potato chips.

I have also started walking

The fact that i can track my progress on Endomondo via my phone has really encouraged me to continue.

http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/user/1009853
And i can both see and feel a big difference already - i walk faster and i don't get tired as quickly.


All in all i am feeling great.


**TL:DR:**

But i need help.

I'm broke since i'm on welfare
And i could really use a few things to help my weigh loss

One thing is new clothes. I'm currently walking around sweating like a beast in my normal everyday clothes because i cant afford new clothes
*1 Big clothes are generally expensive.
*2 The only place i can get clothes my size in Denmark is halfway across the country in an overpriced store
So my only choice is to order clothes from other countries and cross my fingers it wont get caught by customs

Another thing is new shoes, and i get blisters where the holes are, plus its really uncomfortable in the rain.

The third thing is more of a luxury item

**Edit 1**
WoW

i was asked to make a wishlist with sizes and such so here goes:

&gt; T-shirts - 5-6 XL by ""Espionage"" brand standards - which is 58-60"" - 62-64"" according to their sizing chart (147/152 - 157/162 in centimeters)

&gt; Pants - 58"" waist (145 centimeters) by KAM jeans standard

&gt; Shoes - 46-47 EU (US = 12-13 UK = 11½-12½)

&gt; Hydration Pack http://www.hydrapak.com/store-2/#ecwid:category=632541&amp;mode=product&amp;product=2479637

**Edit 2**
And someone asked for my paypal - the email is dummiesworld@hotmail.com

**Edit 3**

I've learned that when ordering from the UK to denmark you avoid import taxes+fee's unlike when ordering from fx. USA

So i went ahead and made a wishlist on the UK amazon

http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/KEHYTU03PODG

**Edit 4**

I have decided a few days ago to start on the so called ""Slow Carb"" diet - from Tim Ferriss's book ""The Four Hour Body"" - i will begin the diet when my next welfare check arrives, and the fat measurer (since he says it is important to keep measurements)

My grandpa gets the idea to pick them separately, and then tells me to go get my wiffle ball bat. For the rest of the day we play baseball with tomatoes, and for a seven year old boy that’s about the best day you can have.
I’m honestly scared for him to go

The main thing I need help with is helping my kids get some Christmas gifts on Christmas morning.  If we don't have power that's fine, and other places but their funds are exhausted.  Any other ideas that I could try? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

My friends have had the shit kicked out of them by cancer. Here's the TL:DR: Kevin (AKA Wash) was diagnosed with [Glioblastoma Multiforme brain tumor](http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Health-Conditions/Glioblastoma-Multiforme-Brain-Tumors.aspx) in November 2009. Neither were in jobs with health insurance. Wash had only a semester of college between him and a career that would provide insurance. Tashi, to keep him from getting hurt, to remember to turn the oven off, to remember his medicines, ect. 

This is why I am here. They need help. They really need financial help. Here is their monthly budget rundown:

**Income**
Social Security income / month $740.00
Food Stamps SNAP $280.00- food only no cash/TAFNF benefits /month

**Expenses**

*MediCare + AHCCCS (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System)     insurance premium $115.25 /month

*Rent $750.00

*APS (electricity) Summer $250-300/month Winter $50-100.00

*Wash's meds (non insured) $800-1000.00 / month

*Co-pay's average month $25-40.00

*Tashi's meds $20 /month with insurance 

*Car insurance $65.00/ month

*Gas $60-100.00 /month

*Phone $55.00 /month

*Cable-Internet $120.00 / month 

*Netflix $25.00 / month (approx)

*Pet needs (food

*Sundries (shampoo, sunblock, clothes) $50.00 or so

*Doesn't account for any illnesses or sudden car issues etc. 

Obviously they run into money shortages on a daily basis. They both came from middle class families that are unable to give much financial assistance. I understand being reluctant or unable to give financially, or just having someone to stay with Wash so Tashi can have a few hours to herself. She has spent the last almost 2 years working 24/7 for no pay. She has kept her husband alive so much longer than the doctors had predicted, and she has done it while watching her husband slip away. Her best friend, the man she wanted to have children with, to grow old with. She will take care of him until her life force is drained. But Tashi needs people to give her support too. 

So now we come to the verifying part of this post. [Here is the link to their local new story](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2010-08-05/news/til-death-do-us-part-they-got-married-then-everything-changed/).  Their story was vetted by the newspaper for several months before printing, learning they would most likely be unable to ever have children, how all the little disturbances we all deal with like car repairs and simple illnesses turn into major problems for them. Please read it.

Wash will not see a cure. He has already outlived what the doctors had predicted for him. Everyday he wakes up is a miracle. Tashi and Wash deserve to have days that aren't full of worrying about how to pay for his medications. They have a lot of medical expenses coming due this Friday

I know this economy is really sucky for most of us

**INFO REGARDING THEIR PAYPAL ACCOUNT BEING IN ANOTHER PERSON'S NAME. PLEASE READ**

**Shannon Rich started the paypal for them since AHCCCS only allows a certain number of ""bank accounts"" of which they count paypal as one. That's what they were told in 2010 after they cancelled his insurance once before. Since it's in Shannon's name and run by the fraternity

**There are also the more personal reasons they do it this way. Tashi lets Shannon know their bills and she gives them enough money to cover them. If there is anything 'extra' she keeps it in paypal for when either of them has an emergency
Wash cannot be trusted with money. It's just part of having brain cancer. So Tashi keeps their accounts away from him and she tries not to put cash where he can find and spend/lose it.**",,t5_2s25d,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/kl6z4/help_say_frack_you_to_brain_cancer_with_my/

What you just looked at are the bandages from the surgery to remove the abscess next to my spine, local food pantry has me enough food until i can get my food stamps going(2 weeks), but I spent nearly every dime on medicine and things like rent, electric deposits etc. My  gasoline is now on E and there is no bus nearby to ride. I need some gas money or even just the gas.

Problem with that is I have overdrawn my PayPal and my bank account so the only way I can think to even receive money for fuel quickly is a moneygram or western union or somesuch, but would certainly improve my health)

In reality, cell phone, email or the Internet. There are a growing number of allegations about the use of illegal restraint practiced by the staff at DRA. Boarding schools do not deny their students access to a telephone; nor do they physically restrain students for speaking out of turn, falling out of line, refusing to perform calisthenics, refusing to count out loud while using the bathroom, or telling their parents that they want to come home. Students have reported DRA using physical restraint in a large number of instances like these.

Victoria did not like or do well in public school. This past January

Victoria’s mother and father were never married

Victoria has not abused drugs, and she is not on any type of probation.

It is our opinion that DRA was misrepresented to the judge

Victoria does not want to go to DRA. Her mother has conducted significant research about DRA and is horrified by the allegations of physical

**WAYS YOU CAN HELP**

- We need to find a lawyer who has the ability to file an emergency injunction (in the state of Louisiana) on behalf of a minor who is about to be court ordered to Diamond Ranch Academy against her will, if someone could do this pro-bono or nominal rate, that would be very helpful.

- We need to get Victoria's story out to the press, especially in New Orleans, please let them know what's happening. You can give them my email address, reddittroubledteens@gmail.com, and I can put them in touch with Victoria's mother.

- IDEAS! Reddit

- Please spread Victoria's story. x-post to reddit, tweet (#SaveVictoria), blog, etc. Social networking can mean all the difference in the world to a girl like Victoria. The judge is up for reelection, and I've heard the father wants to keep this quiet. Make some noise! 

- *Edit: Also

Thank you.

Short Story:
I left my iPad in a bag with some papers for work at a restaurant. When I called the next day they didn't have it. I considered as gone and probably stolen by maintenance.

Fast forward a month to 9/8. I look at my Photostream on my iphone to see pictures that I didn't take and realize they must be from the people who stole it. I go on iPhoto to see that the pictures have location info also. At this point in time I posted my story to Reddit thinking it was a pretty dumb mistake on the criminals part and maybe some people know what I can do.

I contacted the police and gave them all of my details about the story and the address where the photos of the guys were taken. They went over there on Sunday night (9/9) and apparently recovered the device along with my bag and all my work papers (no idea why someone would keep that stuff). They also have the criminals in custody last I knew

So in short

~~~~

Long Version:

I went to a restaurant in NYC (Trattoria Dell'Arte - 900 7th Ave at 57th) on what I think was August 6th. When I left the restaurant I forgot my laptop bag next to my chair against the wall. In the bag was a iPad 2 16GB 3G in Black and some papers from work. When I realized I had forgotten it the next day I immediately called the restaurant who claimed they knew nothing about it

Today I went to check my photostream on my iphone and there was a bunch of photos of the guy who stole it and his friends with location data. So I have the location of what I assume is their house

They hadn't connected the iPad to the internet until today because I had sent a lock request from find my iphone which confirmed lock today. Also I had it display a message to call me if it was found.

All I want is my iPad back. I considered it as a loss already

Please help me get my things back (the iPad is most important

UPDATE:
Local Police have been contacted and given his information. They are looking into it today and will update me as they learn anything.

UPDATE #2:
I have been speaking with the police who last night went to the address I gave them from the location data on the photostream photos. The people living at that address had already been convicted of some other crimes so they were able to match the pictures I gave them and find the guys who took my iPad. They got it back at around 4am last night and will be shipping it to me at the end of the week.

ETA: Someone said this doesn't make it clear what we 'want' out of this campaign. Well, we would like suggestions for how to make this happen. We would like visibility to try and get it into the right hands. Writing a letter didn't work, so we have to find a way to get the letter seen. 




**Letter to Ellen
&gt;*What can’t you say about Jen? She’s a rockstar. She’s spunky, silly, beautiful, amazing, compassionate, a chef, a mother, a sister, we go to Jen’s. There we  have a shoulder to cry on, telling jokes

&gt;*2008 was a big year for Jen. It started off with a BANG, so this tiny miracle meant everything to them.*

&gt;*Only a month after this happy discovery, finally succumbed to the diabetes with which she had been struggling for many years. Margie passed on April Fool’s Day (no joke), but not before correctly divining her unborn grandchild’s gender and naming him Liam. Margie’s death was mourned by many people - she had been a devoted and intensely loving mother and wife, but her mourners extended well beyond blood ties. Margie was, like her daughter, a powerful force of positivity and good will in her world. Many a birthday, Halloween, New Years

&gt;*Days after Margie’s funeral, undetectable by standard examination. Had it not been for Liam, Jen’s cancer would have gone undetected for who knows how long and we may have lost her forever.*

&gt;*The following months were tenuous, but love for her child took precedence over her own well-being, so treatment had to wait until his birth. In early September, when Liam had been cooking for thirty-two weeks (the earliest gestational age at which docs will voluntarily take a child from the womb), a cesarean section was performed and Liam spent weeks in the NICU while his mother began radiation and chemotherapy. In December, Jen underwent a radical hysterectomy and was declared cancer-free the following June.* 

&gt;*For years, this past October, Jen came down with what she believed to be bronchitis. An asthmatic since childhood, her difficulty breathing did not cause her much alarm. She sought medical treatment, which proved fruitless for many weeks, until she was diagnosed with Laryngoesophogeal Reflux, which was blamed for her respiratory difficulties.*

&gt;*Just before New Year’s

&gt;*That’s not how it went down.*

&gt;*Jen’s tests came back abnormal and, so under the knife she went. Before she had even recovered from the anesthesia, we were informed that she had very aggressive cancer in both lungs. Pathology reveled that it was a recurrence of the cancer we thought she had beat in 2008.* 

&gt;*At this point, she grinned and replied, “I’ve got a rainbow Bozo-the-Clown wig just waiting to be worn and I’m gonna pencil some awesome tranny brows, maybe even rainbow to match.”*

&gt;*Jen

&gt;*We honestly believe that a genuine Ellen encounter would change her life, but we truly hope you’ll consider the journey of this amazing woman. Help us knock you off of her “bucket-list” and perhaps give her the experience of a lifetime. No one would appreciate it more.*

We were set to proceed with a living donor transplant from his brother, and now his brother is no longer a donor option. 

Other members of our family either have the wrong blood type or are out of the age range. We are now reaching out to our community to seek a potential living donor candidate. 

The criteria for a living donor are the following:

* Good Health

* Type O (doesn’t matter if – or +)

* Between 18 and 55 years old

* ~~Similar Size to Recipient


Additional info from the Cleveland Clinic:


The Donor:

* Must not be pregnant.

* Should not have any major medical or psychiatric problems

* Must understand the risks of the surgery and follow instructions for short and long-term care after the donation.

* Does not need to be a blood relative of the recipient; spouses

I have been drinking and using drugs with ever-increasing frequency since I was 11. I would consider myself an addict, crippling feeling of emptiness that has caused me to use drugs and alcohol multiple times a day for several years. This has cost me more jobs, homes, and friends than I can count. Last week I was dragged to an AA meeting and was inspired to try and get my shit together. I've been spending every minute since with other people in the program, and, to my complete surprise, you can feel good without getting fucked up, but completely baffled.

Here is my situation:

* I have housing through the end of January. I'm hoping to come up with enough money over the next few weeks to pay February's rent. I do your typical broke-ass hippie stuff--I read tarot cards in coffee shops and before I ran out of materials I was doing caricatures.

* I am desperately looking for a job, but no one is hiring until after the new year. A friend of mine who found a better job is trying to get her boss to give me her job at a consignment store.

* I do not drive. I only have a bicycle. I'm not afraid of distance and I ride an average of 15 miles a day as it is

* I do not have any presentable clothing. The same friend who is trying to secure me a job is approximately my size and has promised to lend me whatever I need

* I have applied for food stamps. I spend the emergency stipend and the rest is still pending.

* I have literally no money

* I barely have phone access. Someone bought me a pre-paid phone but I only have $15 left on it and I'm afraid to use it in case I run out of time before a prospective employer calls me.

* I've been offered a flight home, and no desire to go back there, especially since it would be walking right back into the people and situations that caused me to use drugs in the first place. I think my best shot at sobriety is to stay put.

All I've really got is my dog. This may sound stupid to all of you, lonely death. If I gave her up I could probably stay in a womens' shelter and not have to worry about rent, but I just can't. She is everything to me and I love her like she was my child. There is a pet food pantry every other Saturday at one of the local churches and so far she hasn't been much of an expense and is instrumental to my sanity.

Where do I begin? Or, but for the past few years my only priority has been making sure my dog is fed and getting fucked up, so from here I'm just kind of like ""?????????""

This week I'm house-sitting

**I DO NOT WANT ACTUAL MONEY. I am an addict and I do not trust myself. If there was any way anyone could put time on my phone (I think as long as you have my phone number, or send a check to the DMV so they'll send me a new ID.

Anyone who has donated if you feel that you want your money back let me know. If anyone wants to continue to donate the money will go towards pain medication, and planting an orange tree in his honor.

As I said in the title, and an unemployed wife. I am employed and I make enough money to keep us above water. However, we are living in a bug infested shithole apartment. The reason being is that we pay over $1000 a month for health insurance. My wife cannot get a job as she has to stay at home and tend to our children. 

I was involuntarily separated from the US Air Force after 9 years because they decided to cut back on people and I was picked for DOS Rollback. They separated me one month after my daughter was born. I was lucky as I was able to find a decent job month after I was out

A little background on my son:
My son was born at 26 weeks and spend the first 109 days of his life in the NICU. He is 2 and a half years old now but struggles with cerebral palsey, but we are struggling right now to even make ends meet.

I'm not asking for much, it's your choice. I'm just hoping some kind soul will see this and reach out a helping hand. If you feel like you want to help, please message me.

We live in Hattiesburg

I'll post some pics of my children in the comments.

Edit 3: I have received a good many questions about this so I'll address it. My son's Cerebral Palsy is mild. He doesn't walk, and he will drink pediasure. We also push vitamins and fatty foods (Oils, milk, etc...) through the tube in his stomach. We have been working like crazy trying to get him to eat. We pay for all of the pediasure out of pocket (and it's not cheap). He has been in PT and OT since he was a year and a half old. Hope that answers any questions on him.

Now it looks as if maybe it would have been better if it wasn't caught in time and I'd dropped dead.  ",lilredridinghood2120,63,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/swntv/im_32_just_had_emergency_open_heart_surgeryabout/
I go to work and I notice an itch on my lip. Oh no a cold sore! I've only had 2 other cold sores in my life and am pretty sure an old roommate gave it to me when he kissed me with open sore years ago. I've heard that a cold sore usually only pop up when your immune system is down. I figure I must be really sick and I should get my ass to the doctor. I tell my boss/roommate/friend of 11 years that I really think I should go to the doctor today.
I manage to get an appointment at an office I'd been to once before that takes cash and is fairly reasonable. I was probably his last appointment of the day. He says go to the emergency room. He doesn't know what's going on just looking at it from the outside and all the techs at their office are gone. He doesn't charge me for the visit and continues to make me promise I'll go to an emergency room where they can look at it from the inside.
My friend takes me to the emergency room. They order a CT and after they look at it they come back and the first thing he said was ""It's not good"". I had an aortic dissection. I will post some links with better explanations but basically there were tears in the main artery of my heart and it was splitting...about to burst open and I was going to bleed to death on the inside. I don't feel like getting into to many more extreme details now. It was very frightening. It is a rare thing that usually happens to people late in life and is rarely caught before it kills you. It has an 80% mortality rate and is actually what killed John Ritter. He was diagnosed with a heart attack they did no images and he bleed to death on the inside.
They gave me the choice of going north or south as their people did not feel they were qualified to handle it(I totally agree especially after the care I ended up receiving before my transfer). I chose north to OSU. Turned out to be an excellent choice. Everyone there was wonderful. The care there was excellent on every level. I got there in the evening and had surgery @8:30 am the next morning.
My friend I mentioned before is by my side the whole time. She is like a mother figure to me in some ways. My own mother has just recently passed away and we had been estranged. My friend tells me not to worry. I can still live with her and her husband while I get better. They will help me as we know that if I receive assistance there will be a gap between my last paycheck and the start of this assistance. She brings me home after 11 days in the hospital. The whole staff agrees I'm doing better than they've ever seen anyone recover. I don't need rehab/home help/or anything like that.
At first when I get home her and her husband are freaked out about me doing anything. I shouldn't be doing cartwheels but it's just as bad to lie in bed. I try and explain this to them. Well to her really. Her husband would be called eccentric if they were rich. I think we have that worked out and then a day later right before a phone interview with one of my assistance things he comes and tells me that I have to leave. She won't ruin her marriage over me. That she loves me and will help me any way she can and walks off. I'm shocked and even more upset that she'd tell me right before my interview. Turns out her husband is freaked out that I have oral herpes...and that's why he wants me gone.
Heart surgery is very traumatic. I was very emotional after mine. Euphoric and grateful to be alive. Plus I'd been living in that dying body so long it had even more impact on me. Prior to the surgery I had been a worrier...for as far back as I had memories. They picked up on this the day they were going to discharge me because my vitals signs
Since my friend asked me to leave my recovery is going backwards. I'm scared. It seems everyone else I know that could take me in doesn't have the room. I have no way to get more money and will run out of my prescriptions in about 2 weeks. I am still in a lot of pain and the stress of all this is not helping. I don't have the much energy to try and figure out ways to help myself. I was so happy and so looking forward to six months from now when I'd be healed. If anyone reads this thank you. I feel a tiny bit better writing some of it out and throwing it into the universe...like a message in a bottle.
I need help of all kinds. I have been through a lot of tough times in my life but this definitely tops them all.
I live near Dayton
No I do not have any insurance btw. Have applied for medicaid but has not kicked in yet as I have just now gathered all the paperwork they require. Am in the process of applying for other assistance as well. Even if I am approved for these things it will be months probably. I need help right now so I can relax and heal. 
I want nothing more than to heal and I know I will be in probably the best shape I've been since my late teens. That is when my health problems began. I'm afraid I won't make it there because of all this stress and drama. My recovery already seems too be moving backward because of it. If I've rambled here I'm sorry on a lot of medication.

At the encouragement of the mods

I removed any references to money/donations


There was recently a popular thread on AskReddit asking amputees about their daily lives and what it was like to live without limbs.  The top comment was made by user [sweetxjosie](http://reddit.com/user/sweetxjosie) here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10iiud/amputees_of_reddit_what_was_it_like_to_lose_a/c6dtblg

Sweetxjosie was rushed to the hospital after experiencing complications of what seemed to be a sinus infection – it was, sweetxjosie woke up in the hospital four months later with both legs amputated and little to no memory of what had happened.  She is only 25.  She was at first diagnosed with Lemierre's Syndrome, although doctors are now uncertain about that diagnosis.  With her permission, I wanted to help her share her story.

Sweetxjosie posted an extremely touching [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10iiud/amputees_of_reddit_what_was_it_like_to_lose_a/c6dy1bk) in the thread:

“I'm about to get real with all of reddit

I'm sad. I'm so so so so so sad. I'm only 25, but its so fake, and those that are close to me can tell. I sit in front of my computer every single day. I've been trying to get prosthetic legs and a wheelchair accessible van that I can drive for months now, but I have no money, no savings, no insurance, and medicaid has denied me 3 times now. I hate going out in public because I'm tired of catching stares. The majority of my friends can't be bothered to drive all the way to my mothers house, so I spend most of my time alone.

But thank you for the positive vibes. If anyone needs them

I’ve seen Redditors do incredible things to help strangers.  I followed the story of 3-year-old Lucas, Colorado massacre.  Let’s do it again and help sweetxjosie.

We are looking at two weeks

I know it's a lot of money but recently a bus monitor was donated over a half million dollars in donations for being harassed by a bus full of children. We only need to raise a fraction of that. I think if the Linux community pulls together

Thomas A. Knight has put up a page that tells Ken's story and he's volunteered to host the fund raising page for this effort. Please help us by a small donation and spreading the word. Ken's done magnificent work for the past 7 years in getting Linux computers into the hands of poor children. I'm just hoping that the community at large sees enough value in Ken to help him beat this monster. Because

See Thomas' page here. If the page times out, thank you.

My name is Shawn Myers; I live in Nanticoke, she would cry and pant, and wouldn’t try to go down steps. Upon a visit to the vet they diagnosed her with having injured her back; this is very common with these dogs due to their length of body, along with their tiny legs. 
After 2 weeks of medication I brought her inside from a bathroom break

I rushed her to a local animal hospital near me and checked her in. After mounds of paperwork and tears thinking the worst

My option now is to have her get surgery; the exact procedure is known as a laminectomy. This involves removing a portion of her vertebra to widen the spinal canal. A full detail can be found here: [Laminectomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy). I decided that I needed to go forward with the surgery, next to me, and the real only living memory I have of her. It was her everything. Myself, I am a hardworking college student at Full Sail University in the Music Production program. I work a full time job that basically goes towards interest on my college loans and bills. To pay for this surgery, I had to apply for a credit card at a high interest rate (15%). The procedure itself can cost up to 4,000$ to perform; I had to put 3,100$ down for them to even commit her in the surgical center. 
Reddit, no matter how small, will help me not go into complete debt to save the one I love. Below I have links to pictures and the bill for her. 

If Reddit helps me with the cost of this procedure for me

With Love

I just got done doing her therapy exercises to keep the blood flowing to her legs while her back heals. It makes her so uncomfortable so we wait an hour or so after her meds are given. The tattoo is looking awesome. Can't wait for it to heal up so I can put my arm down hehe. Also! the 200$ I needed was funded this morning by a donor I work with. So all of her original surgery costs are covered! We did it!!!! If I get any additional money it will be used for her follow up appointments (apparently there is a few), but its still messy. I will keep updated, thank you all!

1/28/2012: Gypsy is having an OK day today. She seems to be in a little pain since she is panting a lot. We started to take her outside to go to the bathroom so she gets uncomfortable when we do so. I am getting nervous since when Misty (my schnauzer) walks into the room she tends to growl. I am hoping it is her protecting herself and her food. Thank you all.

In the midst of having her two oldest children move out, and it takes at least ten minutes to heat up. It's one that has raised cooking rings, which are all tilted and wobbly. There are chipped and burned spots from where my (brilliant) older brother accidentally melted a silver cooking pot on not only the stove, but all over the counter and sink, too.


.

My mom dreams of a fabulous kitchen makeover in the same way that some people wish to win the lottery. So


.

My goal is **$500 by Christmas**-- about $300 short of what the estimation for the stove will actually be. 


.

**Long story short


.

Buy one for yourself! Buy one for you mom and dad! Buy one for your grandma! Buy one for your dog! Buy one for ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS! Buy one for your family and send it out as a Christmas card! Buy one for each of your friends and use them as trading cards! Buy them for your pets and use them to brag about what beautiful domesticated animals you have!

All you have to do is send pictures of who/what you want drawn to **ashleyhollaback@gmail.com!** Each person/animal is **$2**

.

If this works (and I’m hoping it will!) I’ll only have to draw **250** of these bad mamma-jamma’s by Christmas/New Years (that’s about 10 a day!)

Please shoot me an e-mail at **ashleyhollaback@gmail.com** if you’re interested in ordering one or two or two-hundred-fifty of these awesome little cartoons! The money will be sent through Paypal

Here is the back story: My mother, to open a clothing store in her home town.

 I came along to help in anyway I could (plus I had my own reasons for getting away). My father stayed behind in Oklahoma, etc.

 The arrangement was supposed to be she lived up here during the summer (tourist season), I suppose.)

After a few months, his kids are all adults, he owns his vehicle, etc. Soon after that, my mother found out about some girlfriend he had, and confronted him. My father, being the person he is, and cut her off completely. 

After that, but pushed us to come up here).

 I don't know how much detail I can give regarding the divorce, pulling all kinds of dirty tricks (even resorting to dragging MY name through the mud in court).

 For a short time, that only lasted a few months until the next hearing. 

That next hearing was cancelled

Every hearing since has been cancelled, and no one knows where he is.

There's a lot to this situation so please bare with me. The last three years have been a blur of survival mode

Anyway, and thank god she was able to get my father's insurance to help, but she can't work due to chronic pain. 

Shortly after that, and my pride was still somewhat intact because I was selling things. I didn't have much, though, and ultimately I only raised maybe $130 or so. Still, I am eternally grateful.

After that, until I was able to get another place, although I'll probably lose that soon.

Now, and I am out of ideas (not to mention energy). 

We are backed up on everything, but those in Michigan know how that can be. Not even taco bell has called me back (at 31, you can imagine what that does to one's self image). 

I was turned down for food assistance because I went to school this semester. Apparently here in Michigan, can't have both. (Trying very hard not to sound bitter). 

Next week, it's an hour away.

My mother, frankly, extremely worried about her emotional well being. This store is her livelihood, and it's truly the only thing she has. She has been a homemaker for 30+ years, and even if not for her back, no one will even consider hiring her.

 We have both tried everything! She is still waiting to hear from SSA about disability. This is truly our darkest hour, reddit has really kept me sane, and for that alone, I thank you all).

If I can raise $25, I know we will make it through the winter. That's just to make it to summer, after that I really don't know, it's difficult to think that far ahead when I'm just trying to keep afloat until next week.

I will be adding as much detail as I can throughout tonight and tomorrow. My mother is asleep at the moment

Rent for the store,300

My mother's apartment rent

Sales tax is at $1

Electricity for my place

Insurance on the store: $200

Internet (we also need this to run credit cards if there is a sale): $237.11

My rent
(My own expenses are the least important

Total of just the backed up expenses: $7

Now, hence the $25,000 figure. That's a huge number, but if enough people help just a little, I know it can be done. Please, reddit. I'm pretty desperate right now. Again, if anyone has any questions, please PM me.

I have no clue where to begin. This is extremely difficult to put into words as it is an accumulation of several years/events that I still have problems facing. I feel that my resources have been extended beyond their means.

I am a early-20's y/o male, just to name two). Multiple semesters I was considered ""disabled"" due to the severity of my ulcerative colitis (this involved being placed on the home-bound program and home-schooled by the county school system for cumulatively half of my high-school enrollment). I graduated with a very respectable GPA (4.xx+) and received multiple scholarship offers. I spent my freshman year living at a private university ranked amongst the nations best in major. After a year of university studies, I decided to change my major from pharmacy to double in business/humanities and then transferred to a local community college (this was after being told by my father that changing my initial major was the most devastating thing I could have done, short of coming out of the closet, and that he would no-longer support my education financially). At this point, I moved back in with my parents and completed a semester at community college. 11/2009 I dropped out of college and secured a job about an hour away. My moving out was ultimately the collaboration of my fathers substance abuse and my mothers enabling it.

My father was an alcoholic/narcotics abuser on a daily basis for the past 20 years and this was not brought to face until I moved out of my parents house in fall 2009 (despite my efforts to bring this to family attention for years beforehand). My moving out in November spurred my father to check himself into a rehabilitation center the upcoming January (2010). From 11/09-01/11 I was able to maintain employment but my medical issues began to resurface

In July of 2011, I have had two jobs for less than a month each, both situations it being mutually understood at my time of quitting that I could not continue working under my medical conditions.

My medical issues have made it impossible to find work locally. I have tried several online job-search sites along with exhausting personal contacts, gastrointestinal pain/odor, and unpredictable bowel movements (avg 15/day).

I have applied for medicaid and was denied (reapplying). I have applied for ss disability and am still awaiting response. I have filed unemployment and am still awaiting response. I do receive food stamps. No savings/checking (have sold everything to my name over the last months to buy time). Full tank of gas.

All I need is an opportunity. Be it, or job that allows an individual to work on their own schedule/15+ bathroom trips per day. I am willing to work any job/task, full or part-time, as long as I have continuous/immediate access to alleviate myself. I will literally jump in my car and drive to California tomorrow if the promise of stability is there.

Ask questions

tldr - Intelligent, help, etc would be great.

1330400966.0,q96l3,Hey Reddit - My dad has Cancer and I need your help to do something amazing for him...,,63,8,9,"Hey Reddit

This is a bit of a longer read

I'm turning to you to make something very special happen for my dad as my own resources have run out. My dad (70) was diagnosed with Stage 2A Pancreatic Cancer about 7 months ago. He has had surgery to remove a 3.6cm tumour from his Pancreas and is now taking oral chemotherapy drugs. For the most part, but he has changed a lot and definitely has a lot more he wants to do before he ""kicks the bucket"" or so he likes to say.

One of the things he really wants to do is to travel to Argentina. He has a lot of friends who have travelled before and it's been on his bucket list for the past 20 years or so. He is not the ""spend money on himself"" type of guy so would never do this type of thing on his own, which means I am about €1300 short. We wouldn't be staying in expensive, lavish hotels, and we wouldn't be going there for shopping by any means, it's just to experience the culture and see a beautiful slice of this planet that he has never seen before. A friend of a friend of a friend (and so on) can help me out with cheap flight tickets.

Bit of a back story: I moved away from Germany when I was 19. I wanted to see other places and just....get away. My dad has always been a working man...a proud guy. We were close but we never really had those typical ""father and son"" moments. It changed a bit when I moved to Canada, it just never happened...or my expectations were just too high, god knows). So, last year I moved back (Amsterdam) and I am glad I did. We're talking on a daily basis, we're doing stuff, he's finally opening up to me (he never spoke about his feelings before). Things are great.

I do fully understand that there are tons of people on here that need help far more than I do. Which is why I would pay every cent back if needed, but the bottom line is that I do need some help.

I'm asking you, I've set up a Chip-In page **[HERE](http://atripwithdad.chipin.com)** as I want to show you guys the progress and I have also posted a photo of him there. We'll even send you a postcard or bring back a tiny souvenir for you if you want! There will for sure be a big picture dump as well as many updates from the road. 

So please, has worked hard all his life and needs something like this but I'm not able to do it without a little help.

A little backstory; my name's Sam, with one of my best buddies, Nathan. We both were on the receiving ends of breakups last year, and decided that whilst young, free, single and spontaneous, we wanted to do something really awesome that would truly tear us out of our safe realms of our comfort zones in exchange for new experiences.
Anyway, he's wanted nothing more than to explore the world - and with my new-found spontaneity since my breakup, we both decided to spend a month touring the USA, coast to coast, to meet new people, new stories, new weather and (hopefully) some awesome experiences. We're planning on flying to Vancouver to stay with one of Nathan's friends for a few days to rest up and get our bearings together, stopping at as many places as we can along the way. 
This is (hopefully…!) where Reddit comes in; we want to experience as much as possible - everything from the totally normal to the completely abnormal, a place to stay - or even something truly unusual and out of the ordinary - it would be really amazing if you could give us a bit of a guided tour around your town. We're not going to say no to anything if we arrive in your town (within reason, of course…) as this whole expedition is really meant to blast us well out of our comfort zones to experience things we hadn't even imagined.

With us being grads from a filmmaking course, friends and family; which will be uploaded after the whole expedition for Reddit's entertainment. We also plan to send anyone involved a DVD with everything on it as a little way of saying thank-you!

So if you know somewhere, meet or do, you live somewhere in America and think you could put up with our somewhat annoyingly thick British accents - then we would be hugely grateful if you could show us around your town. *tip of the hat*

TL;DR: We're road-tripping across the USA, and we're filming the whole thing too. Thanks!

Before i post my question some backgroud info: (if you just want to sign please scroll down


My next door neighbour Julio Poch has always been a proud man.
He had a successful career as a examiner-pilot at Transavia (a Dutch airline company) 3 kids and was a very pleasant man to talk with.


3 years ago suddenly i got called while i was at work


He got arrested because he was accused of being involved with the so called ""Death Flight's"" made by the E.S.M.A. (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada) during the war in argentina.


Me knowing the background of my neighbour i felt something was wrong, because it could only carry 2 persons).


The only ""proof"" argentina has is that Julio was on a trip to Bali where he had an dinner with some colleagues and spoke about the war.
He spoke about the war in the same way we currently talk about our beloved sports games ""We have scored"" ""we won"" ""we made it to the finals""


He spoke about the death flights: ""we trew them into the sea"" 
I do not know the entire conversation for i was not there


Because of the different nationality's of the people at that table they chose to speak english.


Everyone on that dinner was not an native english speaker


because Julio knew he was innocent he volunteered freely to go to Argentina and proof his own innocents.
the first trial took about 1 year, second trail never came and instead the public attorney said he had more proof of Julio being guilty. Proof witch was the exact same stack of paper he came with the first time (and didn't proof anything).


because now there was this stack of paper Julio got arrested again


The Dutch authorities doesn't help because of our princess's father (Mister Jorge Zorreguieta) who was a minister at the time of the war in argentina and now an refugee in the netherlands in hiding for the things Julio is now taking the blame for.


(FYI


Since he was arrested he became a grandfather of grandchildren he has yet to meet..


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So here is my question
will you please sign this petition in order to kick the Dutch politics awake and help Julio getting a fair trial.


Because at the moment we don't believe we will see our beloved neighbour ever again in real life.


The petition can be found at: http://www.petitions24.com/tegen_schending_mensenrechten_julio_poch
All background info can be found at: http://juliopoch.org


You have my sincered thanks for reading my story


please help a innocent man getting a fair trial so he can go back to his family.

Kick in?,cyndyetler,61,11,67,"**tl;dr** first: this ass-kicking teacher at an Alabama juvenile prison (who is also a close friend of mine) won 20 copies of Fahrenheit 451 so her students can each get their own copy....but she has 28 students. Can you kick one in? Or fast food or toiletry gift certificates for kids who don't get visitors? DM me for the physical mailing address

Somebody knew what they were doing when they gave Mercy Pilkington her name. If she worked at the public school across the street in her Alabama town, and nobody cares for them like Mercy does.

Let me tell you something about Mercy: she's a human freak show. Her generosity, her apparent lack of need for sleep--she makes no sense. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. The National Juvenile Detention Association saw fit to award her Teacher of the Year in 2010; her work has been covered online [here](http://jjie.org/healing-words-creative-writing-programs-as-therapy-for-kids-detention/99293) and [here](http://ec.libsyn.com/p/0/5/d/05de315691e24d2a/Substance_Abuse_411-55-Creative_Writing_Program_as_Therapy_for_Kids_in_Detention-Mercy_Pilkington.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01ce823fd7cf5923b6&amp;c_id=5288921). 

For the second year in a row, when you're a kid in prison in Alabama. Trust me.) The book this year will be Fahrenheit 451, a reddit fave! Here's the problem: while Mercy gets 20 books, she has 28 students. She would love donations of copies, new or used. The kids would love if you'd put a personal note in the inside cover! 

If you're feeling creatively generous

--Some kids don't have visits from family due to court order, some of whom are as young as six, stuck in their cell while the other kids get visitation, but they also miss out on the perks that family visitors can provide: fast food treats and toiletries that aren't gross prison-issued. If you'd like to REALLY make a sad kid's day, you can send a gift certificate for one of the fast food joints near the prison, and Mercy would pick up the grub, or same process for drugstore goods. 

You can send a virtual gift card (to mercypilkington@yahoo.com) from these spots:  [Subway](https://www.vcdelivery.com/Cert/T2/cert_MyCertificate.aspx?sample=true&amp;GSID=oXkPWE5GgLpEYvF9S%2BNH5g%3D%3D), so DM me for the mailing address. 

Toiletries: DM me for the mailing address to send the following: Toothpaste: any kind; soaps/shampoos: both the bottle and the product have to be clear. They can be colored

Or send a virtual gift card (to mercypilkington@yahoo.com) for one of these drug stores: [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/cp/Walmart-eGift-Cards/175427) or [CVS](https://cvs.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/?ref=cvs1). [Dollar Tree](http://www.dollartree.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=GiftCards) will mail a physical gift card for free; DM me for mailing address. 

--Copies of any new young adult books--good ideas include Bluford High books, Divergent, Insurgent, Vampire Academy...or maybe MY young adult book, which is a memoir about my own teenage incarceration, [Straightling](http://www.amazon.com/Straightling-Memoir-Cyndy-Drew-Etler/dp/146990280X)! (Shameless, right? And maybe cancel that idea--freak Mercy, mind you

--Or let the kids choose with [Amazon giftcards](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-com-Gift-Card-Thank-design/dp/BT00CTP6GS) (which can be emailed directly to Mercy: mercypilkington@yahoo.com)

--Remember how I said some of the kids in the prison are six years old? Yeah. Mercy said she'd love to receive crayons and coloring books

And finally, telling them there's a new comment, the kids get all cheery and hopeful. 

Thank you

Love

Very early on, decided he just didn't want to deal with being a dad to a ""handicap kid"" and is not in their lives anymore. (Sadly she isn't able to afford to take him to court for child support.) So she's been raising him on her own for several years now. She is unable to have a job as his needs demand total care and is modest in the amount she will(and/or is able to) accept for help, so she is not in the position to purchase a new vehicle on her own.

My brother came into her life (actually re-entered, and has even recently moved in with them after being together almost two years, he does have to work (for very low wage) full time, so they are still unable to afford this on their own. 

As briefly mentioned, so they have set up a fundraiser website to try to raise funds to at least help with buying one. 

I have seen Reddit be amazing and turn up in numbers, hoping really for just enough to potentially turn an old van into a handicap one. However, it would be amazing if they could reach, or surpass, their goal to really get other things they desperately need as well. If you are able and can find it in your heart to make a donation, go to http://www.giveforward.com/austinsvanfund and help. Any amount helps, and if you can't make a donation, your well wishes/good vibrations/prayers/thoughts/whatever would be something they will appreciate just as much. Thank you either way.

I have a £30k loan to pay for my studies (the course does not fall under the government's student loan program) and the cost of this round trip is beginning to add up. A Nissan Leaf will help me reduce these costs dramatically!

There is also a link to the fundraising we did (still accepting donations I think) for the Down Syndrome Buddy Walk. Oliver was diagnosed in April. We thought about putting up a medical donation page to help with out of pocket expenses but that has been pretty good as we do have insurance (however, and our premiums starting in January are going up to 700$ a month with me having to quit my job and switch us over to our husbands plan). I don't think we can complain about premiums ever considering he will probably reach the 1mil mark (he also had open heart surgery at 4 months old). So I thought I would post his wish list if anything people can get him an xmas present. Reddit schwag would be cool too (message me for a shipping address).. he wears a 4T but 5T would probably be better as some things run small?. (the little 4 month old is passing up the 6 month and 9 month clothes incase you wanted to include him).

I can tell you right now off that wish list if he were to get something is that catbus since he has been watching the movie related to this stuffed animal daily (he got the movie for his bday).

So there you have it reddit. We will be just fine, but with all the unknowns its always going to be up in the air until he is fully done with his chemo treatments.. which will continue until the summer of 2013). When his counts are low he gets cabin fever because we can't play with friends or at the playground. He doesn't understand most of this cancer thing either, just that he has this broviac line in his chest that he gets medicine for.

Thanks for listening reddit.

**Here is his story...**

***

Hello, but there are so many twists, I couldn’t make it shorter. And speaking of twists, I’m going to start at the mid-point.

It’s a cloudy night, elated, excited, a little guilty. I’m standing in a highway rest stop in rural New Hampshire as the sun sets in a gray sky. I’m standing next to a man I’ve grown close to, a man who represents what I’ve been fighting for fifteen months. We’re looking for the white car.

This car isn’t just some white car. This car is my salvation. As I search the lot for a Massachusetts plate, Jimmy, this doesn’t have to happen. We can still go back. I know how you feel about Shortridge, but we don’t abuse kids. You know that.”

“No

No one in the real world calls me Jimmy. It was always James, and how I could not get into a fight with my parents that night. I thought all that sucked. Looking back I realize I didn’t know what suck was. I didn’t know until I began my “therapeutic journey.”

I should’ve ran two years ago

He asks me, talk about anything besides what we’re doing. When we get back to the rest stop, the white car’s still not there.


                                       So we wait.
                                               And wait.
                                                       And wait.

A long time later, then hands it to me. It’s my best friend. I haven’t seen him in over a year and a half.

Are you okay? he asks. Do you trust this man? he asks. Where are you? he asks. I tell him where we are. I tell him what the car looks like. I tell him I’ll see him soon.

I don’t tell him how it feels to be free. I don’t tell him I don’t know if I’m safe--that I half-trust the man

He knows almost nothing about my situation

The man tries again: “Jimmy

I ignore him. I don’t want to be homeless

As the sun passes below the horizon, I realize that I won. Once again, I realize that I’m fucked. I note the paradox as my best friend drive up.

After all this time, less acne. No wonder he didn’t recognize me at first.

And over that echo of eighteen months ago, in 18 months: “Hey.”

“Hey

The man approaches and introduces himself. My friend looks at him

The man tries one last time: “Jimmy

“No

“Well

“You should know me by now. I don’t plan on it. I won’t say it’s been good

I get in the front seat

And that is how I almost gained my freedom.

Three days later I’m sitting in a cafe, did it?”

And my mother’s there, “Yeah, it didn’t work out.” We discuss terms, the “agreements” behind my return to Shortridge Academy. We don’t discuss how I’ll explain to everyone at the school how, in three days, I went from prisoner to free man and back. And how this time, I have to be perfect. How one fuck up will put me on the streets of Portsmouth

Now that I have your attention, I would know more than I ever wanted to. Like the man said, Shortridge isn’t physically abusive. But you can abuse parts of a person other than their body.

I think I was sent away on August 21st, you know? I was sent away for bad grades. At least, bad by my parents standards. Almost all Cs. I'd failed French (by one point!), and I took summer school for Algebra II.  I probably could have done better. I'm not going to blame my grades on ADD. I will, however, blame half of it on my parents. They weren't great parents. But still, the other half was on me. 

I was not escorted to Summit Achievement, Maine, and I don’t have much to say about it. It wasn't bad, and they were more ethical than other programs. I would never send a kid there, but still, it wasn't that bad. I had some fun, sometimes is sucked hiking eight miles in the rain, but not really that bad. Unfortunately

I've been a ""shut-in

When the insurance company (through my husband's job) doubled the premiums, I had to begin ""adjusting"" the dosage. 

The premiums will double again in January. 

Both my illness and even the ""adjusted"" dosage of the medicines have dramatically reduced my income. 

Even before the increased premiums and co-pays, I was told we don't have enough credit card debt to qualify).

Any chronic illness is costly. We have nothing of value to sell. 

We're no longer able to help our families. 

That was the most horrible sentence I've ever had to type. 

My husband is the best and most noble man who ever lived.  He's already working &gt;80 hours most weeks. It's not humanly possible for him to take a part time job. We don't have the cash to pay for COBRA

There is no pain worse than watching a loved one suffer

I ""ration"" the medicine I can afford so I can keep pain off my face when he's home. There's no deceiving him about that. We've been together over 20 years. He loves me.

I have been deceiving him about the medicine situation. I tell him I got more samples than I did

He's sacrificed so much already, for me. I can't tell him it's not enough. 

The kind of work I'm able to do, and when it goes, with it will go even my illusion of usefulness.

Because of my husband's job

Although his income isn't enough to pay for the medicine

This would be the case even if he divorced me. That would, but if he were still providing me with shelter and food, his income would make me ineligible for indigent care.  The state is on to that one. He would have to literally throw me in the street.  That I even know this literally makes me nauseous.

I'm still able to walk short distances

Although I'm ancient on the internet :) in real life it will be a year and a half before I can even apply for a few hundred dollars a month from Social Security - and even longer before I'm eligible for old age medical care.

**Update:** I changed my mind. I **AM** asking for money. Not for me, and still coming up short.

If you're lucky enough to have discretionary income, even a couple of hundred dollars a month can keep a family you know in housing, fix the old hupty a single mom needs to get to work, buy someone's way out of pain, or even some extra time with  their families.

If you're really lucky, or even save a life.

Please, work the register where you buy things, the person who empties your office wastebasket at night, the friend or relative you know doesn't make much money, but who will literally die of shame before they ask for help.

We moved from Texas to Connecticut(Hartford area) less than a month ago and are homeless. I have a college degree come from an affluent family. Which makes this sobering truth harder to swallow. We found ourselves in Connecticut after taking my grandmother up on her offer to live with her. Prior to that we lived with my fiancees father who we turned in after finding child pornography on his computer. My grandmother died due to complications from a blood clot on our way up here. We had money saved up but it was quickly squandered on motel stays while I frantically job searched. I found a job which I start on Monday as a hotel manager but our money is gone and we are driving on a donut(tire popped a week ago). I'm frightened I am putting my daughter in an unsafe environment by driving on this ticking time bomb. Not to mention the litany of problems having no money presents. We have sought some government assistance but that a slow and arduous process. I have sold what little possessions of mine I brought as most of our stuff is in storage in Texas. I'd even be willing to sell our car as it is a 2012 to get an older one and pocket the difference. It is so frustrating to claw your way out of a hole only to make it deeper. I need help or its very likely we will lose our little girl. If anyone knows of a place we can turn to please don't hesitate to let me know.

So here's the breakdown: 
I decided in January I wanted to take a gap year from university and be an au pair somewhere. After looking through many sites and being contacted by families from all over the world I was contacted by this agency. They told me they would place me in a family and promised me all these benefits. 


* 12 month contract: trip to china reimbursed, and they denied and stalled for another month until I finally forced them to pay me, they have refused other au pairs who had the same contract as me*


*  Monthly compensation of 750RMB-1200RMB or more 


* Visa Invitation, and pay you back MAYBE a month later, and offer NO assistance what-soever*


* Arrival Orientation - *...stilll waiting on that one*


* 24/7 emergency call number -*another negative


* Assigned coordinator - *nope


* Monthly newsletter &amp; Cultural Activities - *this is my biggest pet peeve


* International travel and health insurance - *they refused to pay for my insurance because it was too expensive


* Chinese classes with materials - *they refused to put me in a class for a month after my arrival


The list goes on of what they lied about. They've also reneged on our contract in multiple ways. As well as breaking the International Au Pair Association code of conduct. So as you can see


I just really want to go home

She works very, they walk everywhere and take the bus. Last week, her 11-year-old son Enoc and her were walking home from the store when Enoc found a baby bird on the side of the road. He picked it up to help it find its nest but his mom asked him to put it down while he looked for it.

I remember listening to awful 90's rock in her room everyday after school. I remember helping her sneak out at night as teenagers. We were both the oldest member of or families so we instantly bonded.


She was beautiful as was her son


My family is not rich

The funeral is on monday

I need about 200 in gas to make the round trip


This would mean the world to me. Thank you so much

1310779037.0,iqxmj,The New Assistance Guidelines!!! - Please Everyone Read.,backpackwayne,60,16,68,"Here are the new assistance guidelines I have promised. I have listened to your suggestions and input and have come up with a more civil and consistent way to help and be helped. Please read them and tell me if there are any issues I have left out. Of course I welcome your input.

Rollout is working on a verification application. I look forward to it with great anticipation.  We still need graphics to use for the different icons that will be used in the system. (ex: request

Anyway

---------------


**MAKING A REQUEST:**


* Anyone is allowed to make a request but take note you will be asked to verify your situation. **DO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY.** It is necessary to prevent people attempting to work the system from  taking advantage of our good nature.
* We recommend you use your primary account but understand if you choose not to. A new account will look more suspicious so you might be asked to provide more proof. If using a throwaway account you might considered offering to supply your real account to a person considering helping by PM. That is a fair request.
* Proof that you do not want to post in public can be offered by PM. Please have it available to offer the folks that might request it. I’m sorry that we have to ask in your time of need but it is a necessary step.
* If you make arrangements with someone that involves returning any items, contact the person who helped to explain why. If you said you will pay it in back in two weeks and something comes up where you can’t, please just simply let the person know when you will be able to take care of it. We keep track of these transactions so do not violate that trust. A second chance will not be offered.

* Include your city and state or country and province in the post. It makes it easier to find help more specific to your local.

* We offer all kinds of help here but prefer to assist in more direct ways. For example if you are in need of food someone might offer to buy groceries or supply extra food they already have. To simply post a need then be insistent on only taking money is not acceptable. Folks here are very innovative when it comes to solving problems. If you came here just wanting money you have come to the wrong place.

* If someone helps you out

-------------------

** CONSIDERING A REQUEST**

If you see a post that you are considering fulfilling first take some precautionary steps.

* Check the person’s overview page and use it to determine if they are worthy of your help

* Time as a redditor is one method but doesn’t always work. People are sometimes embarrassed to ask with their primary account. I’ve considered not allowing requests with a throwaway account but decided against it. If they are doing this they should be willing to give their username of their primary account by PM. Even if they are new to reddit they should be allowed to make a request but should expect more scrutiny because of it.

* You may ask the person in the comment thread or by PM to supply information to back their claims. But **PLEASE DO THIS IN A CIVILIZED MANNER.** True there are some who might try to take advantage but let us not punish the genuine folks for their transgressions. It is horrible when you are on your last leg and resort to asking for help and get berated.  We can accomplish verification without tearing down the spirit of folks truly in need. There will be no more infighting allowed.
* If you suspect someone of being dishonest and trying to scam the system
* The first rule of giving here is to **NEVER** give something you can’t afford to lose. There might be a chance someone does not live up to their promises. Never put yourself in a position where if that happens you yourself will be put in jeopardy.

-------

* **Before you give any help or assistance gather the private information you would need if a problem should arise. It will be too late to do that afterwards.**

-----------------

* If you make a deal for help that is to be paid back
* If you do loan someone money

-------------------


**OFFERING HELP**

* Once you have decided to assist someone please make sure you have verified them to your satisfaction.
* Consider more innovative and direct ways of supplying help. Just sending money may be easier but it increases the chance for abuse. If someone wants help to pay their gas bill considering paying that bill yourself directly. Gifts cards to a specific outlet, directing people to agencies that can assist and good old fashion advice is always the preferred method. The “wish list” has been suggested buy I think that only serves to be too specific and limits the ability of the giver. I do not recommend this method.
* If you decide to give money directly to the person please verify them before you do. Assume in your mind the worst possible scenario and decide what information you would like to have should it occur. Then gather that information beforehand.
* If you make arrangements for a loan make the terms specific to both yourself and to person you help. Please let me know about these transactions once they have been fulfilled or broken. I like to keep track of them so we know who is worthy of our help. 

-----------------

*Within minutes of posting these guidelines one of our subscribers put them into action. It was done flawlessly. Please check this example and how it was handled. No back and forth fighting

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/iqwtc/do_you_have_netspend_so_do_i_please_help/

--------------------


**LET’S REMEMBER WHY WE ARE HERE**

Reddit is more than a place of  rabble and making poop jokes. We actually make a difference. We are proud of this community and the things we do. The generosity here has astounded me. Yes we are nice…

* **If you are unsure of these guidelines you of course can contact me or any of the other mods.** 

We  take this reddit seriously and work to keep its integrity. Should you have questions or suspicions and are not sure how to proceed

* **We will not tolerate any more cat fights. We can be smart but we can also be civil.**

* **And please stop the downvoting unless absolutely necessary.** - It serves no purpose.

-----------------------


**Thank you all for everything you do.**

This is what happened in the mother's own words: 
On December 21st my family had a ""Doomsday"" of our own. We lost our home and everything we owned in a house fire. It was near 3:00 AM when my husband was woken by screams of terror from our 13 year old daughter. He woke me as he jumped from the bed saying that something is wrong. We headed for our bedroom door; as he opened it, thanks to his quick thinking. He had to first move a huge mirrored dresser that was blocking our exit. We were both getting weak from the smoke, so he had to dive head first through the glass to the ground. He grabbed me by my arms just as I was about to fall back and pulled me out of the window. Before I had even hit the ground, he was already headed around the corner of the house to our daughter's window. Her window had an A/C unit that was in the way. He was trying to get it out of the way and had to beat it until it broke loose and pushed it inside. He jumped up through the window; as he screamed her name, she flew into his arms and they both fell to the ground outside. We also had some friends staying in a back room. He was able to pull them out to safety. Both of them had already passed out from the smoke. Our three dogs Betsy, Winnie, and Beanie Winnie were trapped and did not make it out of the house. I thank the Lord above for giving my husband the strength and the will to save all of our lives with his quick actions. The whole house was engulfed in fire. As we stood outside, right arm, the doctors said. I want you to know that my daughter is the strongest person I know and refuses to physically let this hold her down. The hardest part for her seems to be the emotional side of everything. Please pray for our family in this time of

Three of her four kids were at home at the time and they all escaped. The oldest boy was burned severely after repeatedly attempting to go back in the house to get his mother out. He was just released from the hospital this week. 

The cause of the fire has been determined to be an electrical problem with the house's wiring. They lived in an older mobile home that had been added on to and the addition was apparently not wired correctly. 

The children have gone to live with their father who lives about 2 hours away. They have lost their mother, their friends and even their pets. (Note: the 3 dogs escaped harm but couldn't go with them to their dad's. Neighbors are caring for them.)

They held funeral services for her on Tuesday of this week. There is a balance owed to the funeral home. I am asking for your assistance with paying this balance in full. She did not leave any life insurance behind and her family is very poor. 

I will be happy to PM links to any proof of this story. I don't want to violate any privacy rules by posting her obituary or the news story. I can also go take pictures of the burned-out house if further proof is needed. I understand that there are a LOT of fake stories on Reddit and I'm willing to jump through any and all hoops to prove this is legit.

So tell me a little bit about yourself

I do own a home

Do you know someone that needs a small bit of cash for groceries or gas to get somewhere?  I'd like to help.  How about someone that is just trying to make ends meet for 1 paycheck?

I'm also willing to do small loan-type stuff to anyone who might need me.  I'm can to go through anything you might craft or build in your spare time and get you a bit of good press, and I want to connect all of you guys to each other just a little bit more.

Tell me a little bit about yourself.  I want to read through your comment histories and see if you've been nice.  I'm pretty patient and happy to do anything I can to help out my fellow redditors.  Onward!

**I cannot thank everyone enough for the help and I promise to have it all back to each one of you the day I get that financial aid. It means so much to me

**Will update with pics ASAP**

Hi there. I don't really know anywhere else to turn. I need **short term** help. I always keep a buffer in the account in case of emergencies, days after I paid for books, and just 4 days before I am supposed to drive to FL to get my son for the summer.

I rear-ended someone due to fault of both of us. She had no taillights and did not have her blinker on so I had no signs she was going to slow down or stop and therefore had no idea looking to the left for a second would cause such a shitty turn of events. I was not tailgating, by the time I looked back and realized her car was way too close, all the slamming on the brakes I could do couldn't stop my poor little car from going right under her SUVs bumper. Everyone was fine, but my car is done for. It was insured, but it is 11 years old and had 250k miles on it, so there is nothing coming to me int he way of cash towards another car. The cops cited me despite me watching them test her taillights and seeing that they were out...but that is another issue that I will deal with in court.

Right now, but ok. However, the credit hasn't caught up with the paid off debts. I did find someone willing to finance a low priced truck for me, but I need help with the down payment. I have a couple hundred, but I need a couple more. 

I don't want a hand out or a gift. Don't tell me that is what it is because I will pay you back anyway. I am not poor enough to deserve or need gifts...I just need a short term loan. My financial aid comes in July 15th

I just want to go get my kid and enjoy the first full summer we have been able to have since he was a toddler. I am wiling to offer whatever proof I can, I had a redditor offer a gift of cash when I mentioned an airline messing up my christmas flights, and I paid him back. The only other time I have asked for anything here, it was to donate to a charity I was walking for.

If anyone can help out just until July 15th

Paypal - amzngdisaster@yahoo.com

EDIT: [Claim](http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/9933/insurancess.jpg) This came out smaller than I thought it would, etc. If anyone wants me to redo it bigger, I will.

I am open to proving that I am using funds on the truck in any way someone can suggest I do so!

**EDIT 2:** THANK YOU to the redditor who threw in $50!! He didn't give me his reddit name so I don't want to call him out with his real name

**Edit 3:** Thank you to the Greg(g)s of Reddit! Another $50 in the pot!

She developed End Stage Renal Disease, who had no reason to be in Miami, stepped up and decided to get checked to be a living donor. Within 2 weeks he got his initial blood tests, and was a positive match. Four months of testing, and anticipation came to a surprising discovery. This guy, who had never met this woman, was a better match both physically and genetically that her own brother. It's funny how the world works. To fast forward a bit

Her family was so overwhelmed with gratitude, but his dream car. Unfortunately, the car has brought him nothing but problems since day one. It began with a bad alignment, and is at the point of bad piston rings, transmission, rear end, suspension, who has immense plans for this machine. He has a grocery list of parts

I'm not necessarily looking for a handy me out but the car has gotten to the point where he needs to either replace it, I'll make sure of it. I would've written to those shows, but unfortunately they have been canceled. So I will take it upon myself to make sure every forum, media outlet, and news station hears the story of the shops that made a hero's dream come true.

Please, and written to the admins of some of the larger Mustang oriented forums.

Proof can be emailed

Emails to lovematthew18@yahoo.com would be preferred so that he doesn't find this but he is gone for the weekend

Thank you

From the beginning: [Original Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h7iky/i_found_a_pregnant_cat_with_3_legs_not_karma/)    
I found a 3 legged pregnant street cat almost 2 years ago (I am living in Turkey and I appreciate the suggestions of SPCA and other organizations I see in other threads about help for dogs and cats but they do not help me here as far as assistance). She had three babies, so much love and great memories and laughs just lots of stress and money taking care of them.  
That being said we are living in an apartment on the fourth floor. We recently decided we should give them to a friend with a farm for health reasons for us (we have to keep our cats in the room with us
Today the cat had surgery on it's back legs and everything went well and he is doing better but the road of recovery will be long.  
   
   
I am asking today for money for vet bills. We managed to cover the surgery with money we borrowed and can pay back soon (they needed it in cash...1650 Lira...roughly $950
The vet stay so far has been $500 and 3 more days the cost all depends if he needs more IV's and medication...and he may require more surgery eventually.  
This is getting long so I will post photos here and just say anything anyone is willing to offer is greatly appreciated. I am hoping the karma of taking in these cats will be repaid a little.  
[The vet took this photo post surgery](http://i.imgur.com/evWnD6H.jpg) (I am Canadian and one of the vets was as well so it was sweet of them to make that heart)  
[Pins in the legs](http://i.imgur.com/181KzzK.jpg) after surgery. I will update this perhaps because the vet said she would send us photos pre-op...they said the bones were like a puzzle...shattered. Poor cat.

 Mom you were my whole world you always made everything better. I don't know what I'm going to do without you. No one has the heart you had, your love, your kind words, your amazing smile, your guidance, you were the most inspiring person! I will always think of you every day, every hour, I want you back! Everywhere I look I'm reminded of you. You were the best mother any family could ask for. I loved seeing your face light up. Someday I will tell my kids about the amazing person you were. I'm so devastated I wish I came to the party. I'm so sorry life is so crazy and my heart is going to have an empty space until I get to see you in heaven.

This state of mentality was brought about by a panic attack that struck me out of the blue while I was laying in my bed one night. I had never experienced one, fear, chaos, and confusion one goes through during a severe panic attack would be futile at best. It was--in the most conservative terms--the most terrifying experience of my life. Had I had the option to choose death at the climax of that experience, I would not have thought twice, but I got through it even though I was sure my end was playing itself out. Setting in motion a trend, many other panic attacks continued to over take me, near the end I had lost weight, I was hanging on by just a thread. As a last attempt to regain a will, I enjoyed periods of normality and sanity. It was a luxury for me now

In the midst of all this turmoil, it was no longer a passive experience, but had become an engaging phenomenon. My perception had left the realm of singularity and entered the realm of duplicity, resulting in the perception of perception. I became an audience of this being and its interaction with the universe around it. I was now existing in three realms, the core-self, the self, and the platform otherwise known as the cosmos. It was more foreign to me than any language I had every heard, more foreign than the principles that govern world of quantum physics. It was as though I had been living in a two dimensional world and was thrown unexpectedly into a three dimensional one. As hard as I tried to verbalize to the world around me what i was experiencing, to me

How I wondered, hours into days, days to weeks, and weeks to months. My patience was on its final stretch, what was it that I was trying to regain, or what was it I wanted to relinquish, not knowing what to aim for to restore things as they once were,

The dire need for answers has resulted in various assumptions

To the people of r/Assistance:

After reviewing and responding to the umpteenth post for legal advice in order to correct bad advice given by a non-lawyer on this forum

There is a reason attorneys are required to go through rigorous education and testing in order to obtain their licenses

Whether a person's legal problem is criminal or civil (including issues of family law, immigration, involuntary commitment, and foreclosure) the consequences of relying on bad legal advice can be dire.  This is why attorneys on Reddit do not provide legal advice over the internet, but will provide legal information--usually to contact a lawyer in the requesters jurisdiction.  In order to properly advise someone, lawyers need a lot of information.  Any of you who have been represented by an attorney before might remember how many seemingly bizarre and/or personal questions he or she may have asked you.  This is because this information is integral to providing appropriate legal advice.  It is as important as having an understanding of the relevant law.

Many times, but in others, they could be life changing.  They could be the difference between remaining in ones home and being foreclosed upon or evicted.  The difference between being able to file suit due to an injury and missing a deadline and thus never being able to recover for that injury.  I know that the advice that is given here is well-intentioned, but more often than not it isn't just incorrect, but the exact opposite of what an attorney would advise.

All 50 states make the unlicensed practice of law a crime for this reason exactly.

So, *stop providing legal advice*.  In the side bar, there is a link that provides information on the Legal Services Corporation (free legal aid organizations) for each and every state.

He was emotionally abusive for a long time and I was taking care of him because he had the maturity of a six year old and was unable to take care of himself. (Showering, etc...) on Sunday he was mad at me so he grabbed me and pushed me very forcefully into a cement wall.

1365203561.0,1brkwb,[update] Little Eric has passed away,punkinpink,50,5,15,"Hello /r/Assistance today is a very sad day for a wonderful family. 

Some of you may remember my previous [Post about Eric about 6 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/zja09/any_help_appreciated_for_a_toddler_named_eric_and/)  He lost his battle and passed away about two hours ago. 

His prognosis was looking great 4 weeks ago. He had one kidney removed and many many sessions of Chemo and Radiation. They noticed something off so they took him back to surgery to see what was going on. His cancer spread through his whole body and there was nothing any doctor could do. We knew he had a VERY small chance of survival when he was diagnosed

I didn't come here to ask for anything except thoughts and prayers for his family. I do know the family had already planned and put a funeral on a payment plan since they couldn't afford to pay it up-front. So many thanks to the funeral home for doing this for this young family.

I have never had a child myself

I want to thank anyone that commented or PMed me before. Even without raising cash donations

Thank you for reading. I have included some pictures of his last days just to show you how strong he was to make sure he kept people around him happy until the end. Please note that these are in a hospital setting and may be a little upsetting to some. He refused to go home because he wanted to ""get better"" and thought that by staying there,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,,t3_1brkwb

Will you also let anyone you know that I need a job?  For the most part I am computer technical but the problem is I have had one job in the last eight years.  The reason being is my son has Asperger’s syndrome(hasn’t been officially diagnosed but the school system seems to think so) and he needed me to stay home with him.   This was my wife’s idea by the way and when it came time to go to work my wife also decided that it was time for my youngest son to be home-schooled.  

Life has thrown me a lot of curve balls in the last couple of years but I know with your help

A word of advice for you; never ever let your spouse control the money, bills, etc.  This is the issues that I am having now.  The car and house are in her name but do to the fact we are married they are half mine in the eyes of the court.  I am safe for the time being until such time as she decided to file for divorce.

I've been stuck at home since August, aside from a handful of times when someone could help me. It's been rough. But I'll be heading to grad school (through a scholarship and misc loans) in the fall, and I desperately need to have a reliable way of getting to and from class every day, as well as being able to get out of the house more than a few times per month.

I insisted that he go to rehab, he again cleaned out the the accounts and left me for broke.  He's actually doing better then I am at the moment because he's a bloody conman, and found a girl to believe his lies and lives with her now.  I warned her, but she didn't listen.

We are a couple in their mid-30's. We have a four year old son, FL to a small town in Northern Georgia. My wife is the  most empathetic person in the world, and saw it as a chance to repair her broken relationship with her sister. It seemed like a cheap place to live, and I figured even at $10 an hour, we'd be able to survive here. I would kill for $10 an hour now.

My wife just finished her Master's in Education in Guidance and Counseling, and prior to moving, I had planned to get a job with one of several mental health organizations here. They all closed down or moved within months of us moving here. We were surviving on my GI Bill. However, now that I am in my last month of school (My Bachelor's in Psychology) we no longer have that. I've applied everywhere, even the local chicken processing plant, and I never even get a callback. Locals that I've talked to say that no one will hire outsiders here, much less a New Englander like me

My mother used to own two natural medicine stores, she lost them both, went bankrupt, and now makes minimum wage at 60 years old. My father lost most of his retirement during the recent crash, and was laid off as Vice President of the company he had worked at for 20 years. There are also some relationship problems there, he hasn't even sent my son a present for birthday or christmas in years. I think my stepmother has a problem with us. I'm not sure if it's because my wife is Hispanic, or we're not religious

He has lost a pound (and being only 2.5 pounds that is quite a lot of weight). We discovered that his white blood cells were low and was having a hard time fighting an infection that remains a mystery. We have spent over $2500 on him already and have spent as much as we can possibly afford. I wouldn't ask this from you reddit

My son is a junior in high school. He is very interested in engineering and is planning a future in the pyrotechnic or digital engineering field. This camp will help him gain real life experience and a safe immersion into how explosives work and will help him determine if this is the field for him.

We all remember what it was like our first year or two of college

With limited funds, but the rest will depend on him. I don't want him to miss out on opportunities that I feel he really needs, just because his dad and I can't afford them.

I promise that any funds you donate will be strictly used for his explosives camp fees. Any remainder will be used to help with school costs such as track fees, and really quite good, even if I am a little biased. :)

So far we are doing:

1. Her former work is putting on a fundraiser - not sure when.
2. Her Highschool friend is a hypnotist in Vegas
3. www.savetyese.com   We have just set up a blog called “Save Tyese”   where people can donate and we will be doing a facebook blast to all our friends to raise money.


What else can we do?? Is there somewhere else this should be posted? Does the blog work?  Not sure how to get 250 people through the doors to a vegas show from Canada on an unscheduled night.. Any ideas would be appreciated.  Help spread the word.

Here is her story from the blog that we set up on friday: savetyese.com  

“Please save my life. I may only have a few months to live unless I receive laser surgery for removal of a brain tumour.
I am desperate. I have a six year old daughter  who needs her mommy and I need this surgery to survive.
My name is Tyese xxxx  and in October 2010 I found a lump in my breast and went for a biopsy 
Two months later I noticed a lump under my arm. I went back for a second biopsy and this time it showed that I had breast cancer that had spread to my lymph nodes and possibly my spine.
After six months of chemotherapy I was cancer free and feeling healthy. Soon however I started to get headaches. An MRI revealed a brain tumour.   I am still cancer free everywhere else.
Since my journey or battle has begun two years ago I have had a double mastectomy
There is a specialized AutoLITT laser technology which is far more precise and effective than conventional knife surgery. Unfortunately this is only available in the States at the moment and is costly at 70 to 100 k. Again

Some of you might remember me

I am looking to somehow get in contact with the famous rockstar Alice Cooper. Long story short, and constantly asked about. I'd like to be able to at the least contact either Alice Cooper's manager, or Alice Cooper himself in regards to my grandmother. I want to give her something that would really make her happy, something even as simple as a letter from Alice Cooper himself.

I know anything is possible with the internet

My grandmother is a survivor of breast cancer

I've thought about going along the same lines as the Marine who asked Mila Kunis to the Ball

1) If you live in the USA

2) Give out the GoogleVoice number instead of your real cell phone number...put it on job applications

3) Then you tell GoogleVoice to forward all calls and texts to your ACTUAL cell phone number. 

This way, and boom...all the calls go to the new (actual) number, but nobody else needs to change their listing for you. If you run out of money and your cell gets cancelled, it doesn't matter. Just un-forward your GoogleVoice settings, and it will continue taking voice-mails which you can check online.

Bonus: even if your el-cheapo actual cell phone plan doesn't include things like call-block, while everybody else gets right through.

1369073441.0,1ephip,A Little Help Needed For Recently Widowed Teacher. (New PC),Calvyno,42,1,20,"Hello

Never done this before

Just yesterday (Sunday, I get a call out of the blue from a teacher I had in middle school, which was over 10 years ago.  She apparently got my number from a family friend of mine.  She sounded desperate and wanted me to go over to her place to troubleshoot her computer (I work in IT).  She said her computer was showing a message saying her C drive was low on space.  It sounded like a simple problem.

I picked up a simple 16GB USB thumb drive from the store and headed over to her apartment in the afternoon.  As soon as I sat down at her desk and checked out her computer I knew it was in bad shape.  It was at least 8 years old, she still only had a little over 100MB left of free space.

While helping her out, but it was only a part-time job, so of course when I told her she should get a new computer it was out of the question.  Her computer played a major role in her teaching materials.  She was still using floppy disks and CDs.

I felt so bad for her.  She was one of the best teachers I've had,  but I don't get paid much myself so it's hard for me to afford new parts for her.  I planned out a simple build for her new computer here http://imgur.com/QvdvZPv

As you can see it is a very simple PC, and word processing (and clip arts).  I was also surprised at how clean her computer was.  She had no malware of any kind, and for a person that knows very little about computers, it amazed me, considering all the people I deal with at my job everyday whose computers were completely filled with crazy malware.

Of course money is an issue here

Banks that own your debt are generally happy to receive the much smaller but guaranteed money from a debt collector who then seeks to be compensated by the debtor.  But in this case

The Rolling Jubilee is near $500

Letters have been mailed to dozens of debtors.

Make a gift of debt liberation

Start planning for January 21st


But first... Thank You.

You have made the Rolling Jubilee a success of unimagined proportions.

It’s been just over one month since the People’s Bailout telethon.  Can you believe it?  Relive the magic by watching clips here.

Since that incredible night, thousands of emails and, of course, over ten thousand individual donations.  These donations - averaging just over $40 apiece - now total nearly $500,000, or ten times our initial goal.

Every donation will be used to help relieve someone’s debt burden

 

We have already begun to purchase debt. 

On Monday November 12,000.  Documentation of this purchase is available on our blog.  Thanks to donors like yourself, we are able to expose the vulture-like nature of debt collectors, and show just how little your debt is worth to the banks and lenders who sell it off in bundles at pennies on the dollar.

Earlier this week

 

Rolling Jubilee Holiday Cards: Give debt abolition for the holidays this year!

You can choose one of three illustrated cards to give the gift of debt liberation!  Go to http://rollingjubilee.org/gifts/ and generate a personalized holiday card for printing or emailing. These cards are another way you can work to build a social movement against the predatory debt system. Together

Art for the Rolling Jubilee holiday cards was graciously donated by Tim Paul, and Marc Scheff.

 

Next steps

Strike Debt will host visioning session on debt on January 21st, for further announcements about this historic gathering.

Our primary focus over the next few months will be to deeply target the role of debt in our broken healthcare system. We will announce a substantial debt buy - made possible by your generosity - in concert with the release of in-depth report on medical debt that will follow the model of our report on the debt crisis emerging from Hurricane Sandy.  The strike of the Rolling Jubilee and the public service document on the healthcare system, to educate, create paths for direct action and mutual aid.  When we attack the current system, we build alternatives in its place.

Are you starting a local Strike Debt chapter? Great! We’d love to hear about it.  We’re building a directory of chapters around the world.  To get involved in the organizing, and anything else you would like to share with the Strike Debt organizing team.

My parents have never had much money, has given us a very good education and well-being. This has, however, strained their finances for years, they worry about the electricity and phone cutting off all the time, but financial aid programs along with the help of the schools' administrations have let my parents do what they believe is best for their children.

My dad went into business for himself over 4 years ago and it's gone sour. He's also fallen behind on filing taxes because he didn't know how to handle all of the complicated forms that come with owning a business

But as you know, the private college-prep high school has worked with us as well. They've seemed to understand my parents' value of religious education and because it's a private school, they have more free reign over how they do these kinds of financial deals. Also, this school only opened in 2008. I came as a sophomore and my sister a freshman, and a lot of the school's vigor came from its newness and readiness to establish traditions and whatnot, blah blah blah.

Now, such as guiding tours, writing articles and pamphlets, sending cards and mail to potential new students, organizing and working open houses, the works) and is one of the true faces of the school. Point is, she's always been promoting the school and helping it grow.

**But now they're basically stabbing her in the back.** A few weeks before final exams, or Laura is disallowed from taking her final exams and is disallowed from getting her diploma. This will either render her grades incomplete or much lower than she deserves, and will prevent her from going to college next semester, because my parents cannot pay a lump sum after *already* working out a steady payment plan.

**edit: My biggest concern is for her final exams. I understand that money is owed, she at least deserves her final exams.**

Now, but I've already explained their priorities and comments like that won't help. They won't send their children to public school, no matter what. But this decision is taking it out on the wrong person. The only person they're harming is Laura, their star-student, the student who proves much more worthy of these tuition breaks than I was. It's also sabotaging her transcript, as a transcript is supposed to be an example of someone's academic performance, and nothing else. If Laura makes bad grades or incomplete grades as a result of a *financial* issue through no fault of her own

I don't understand why they feel the need to make her grades fall as an insult to not letting her graduate.

Not to mention how *incredibly* un-Christian this is. It makes me sick to see them sign their letters ""In Christ"" as they attack a child for her parents' hardships. They have a choice in the matter. This is a private school.

**What can my parents do? What are your opinions? How can I ruin this school's public image if they ruin my sister's graduation?**

Just over a year ago I was raped, and nightmares. It ruined my life. I went from being a hard-working young woman, with excellent grades and lots of friends to a depressed, broke, anxiety-ridden, anorexic wretch who is too afraid to go to her own mailbox. I was a virgin when it happened and part of me hates myself for having saved myself for 'the one' when all it meant in the end was that this creep had more to take away from me. I was putting myself through college at the time and doing so well at university that I even had an essay published in a medical journal while I was an undergrad. I've always been self-sufficient and have lived within my means. I've tried really hard to keep it all together, but my grades slipped (I even failed a paper for the first time

What I really want is to get my life back. I've already started work on getting my grades back up to my old average, but I can't afford it. I can't afford health insurance, and even if I could I have a pre-existing condition that would make me ineligible. I'm able to afford the fees for visits to my family doctor and for the medicine I am prescribed for depression, anxiety, and chronic insomnia. 

I've tried going to rape crisis and another sexual abuse help organization, but was told that it wouldn't be ""appropriate"" since none of the staff were specifically trained to deal with sexual assault victims. I have never felt more like a leper in my whole life. 

I went to the police, but they said they couldn't help me. I tried the community advice bureau, but they said they couldn't help me. Same for the students' welfare executive and the disciplinary office at my school (he was a student too). The disciplinary office said they couldn't even start and investigation or even take his name down for future reference without him first being convicted of rape. Since the school's code of conduct means that a student can get exlpelled simply for having an open beer on the campus, you can imagine how shocked I was by the university's response. 

I finally found out that ACC (accident compensation corporation) offered a limited number of free counseling sessions for rape victims. However

I'm so tired of doing it all on my own, and I struggle to remember a time when I wasn't sad. I feel so trapped and I don't know what to do to make things better.

I have honestly been debating back and forth on posting this and asking for help. Up until very recently I haven’t experienced very many kind people in my life *other than close family and friends*. However

First a few things about me. I am a stay at home father of 2. My wife has a full time job and we have about $300.00 a week for bills/food/amenities. We live paycheck to paycheck and have nothing saved up at all. Recently we found out our food benefits have been cut rather drastically due to what we can only assume are state wide cutbacks. The cut was nearly 6 months ago now and we have slowly but surely been sinking into debt. We each have a $300.00 credit card *each one is within 50$ of max* that were used when our vehicle broke down nearly a year ago…. 

It would seem that same issue has hit again. Our vehicle now has a 1: blown head gasket, my brother *being the awesome bro he is* has set out to find parts for my vehicle at the best price. He has also found a mechanic that can do it for an exceptionally low price. 

So far he has found an engine head (tested) for $45.00. However, but when the exhaust gas is too much the thermostat can't open and the engine overheats. Thus, we need a new engine…….. SO, my brother set out once again (unknown to me) and found an entire engine for $450.00. (make, model, year, matched it all) The mechanic said he can do the entire swap for $300.00. 

My wife and I have ZERO saved up right now and will be lucky to pay rent tomorrow (my mother has offered to help us :D). So, missing the DHS office’s vehicle help program by 2 months.

My brother and my mother said they will do everything they can to help. But there is just no way we can make it on our own.  Normally it would just be a hassle that would cause my wife to use the bus to get back and forth from work. However

For ANYONE willing to help, but we do have a paypal account that we use regularly. The email for that is Megami619@yahoo.com . That address is our paypal account that can accept most forms of transfers. *not sure how many different options there are.*
If you’re still reading

ALSO: Please, so far those things don’t seem to kick in until it will be too late. I will still be pursuing those options myself but for now we need to get out of this hole. 

**UPDATE 3** Because of 5 awesome and incredible redditors we have already received $205.00. In all we will need $450.00. Nearly half way there. I will be keeping it all in the paypal account until it is absolutely needed.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/jAq1C.jpg) is a pic so you can see it with your own eyes. :D. I have blanked out the names of those who have donated as this is personal information that I would rather not list publicly. If they wish their names be known they need only ask :D.

Anyways

    My on and off girlfriend since 2011 recently started seeing each other again back in September of 2012. We both realized that our feelings for each other never went away and we started dating again. And of course with the dating comes the sex. I admit, she became aware that she hasn't gotten her period for a long time and was experiencing all the pregnancy symptoms. I told her not to worry, I'm not going anywhere, and to abstain from any marijuana or alcohol until I managed to get her a test. 
    Fastforward January 2nd, spreading rumors about me poking holes in the condom(never used one) to get her pregnant on purpose and constantly threatening me with not letting me be apart of my child's life. I know some kind of issues have to be going on with her mentally but it's too late to go back on that. I've been paying all her medical expenses, phone bill, and gas. Anything she needs help with. I'm also currently unemployed but I've applied to several places. Thing is for now, I'm drained financially. I'm currently staying with a buddy of mine in his apartment but he also isn't financially stable. I've got a phone but the service runs out in two days and idk how I'm gonna get the money to pay it. My only reference number for the jobs to call back(I've applied to Fred's, dollar general, Walmart, this will turn into a custody battle after our baby is born. And emotionally, I try to be the perfect boyfriend for her and want to be the perfect father for our child. I really want to be that above all else. I want to spend the rest of my life providing for my kid

My name is Jesse. I recently moved to New York to get away from an abusive family situation. Since I've been here, everything seems to be going downhill. I ended up getting a job while I was here, working third shift in a grocery store stocking shelves. It's important to note that I'm legally disabled, and that the only reason I got this job was because the expenses of moving ate away ALL my spare money besides what I needed for rent. Since I've been working, my food stamps ran out for the month. Because of this, I've become behind on my rent, due to having to spend cash on food. I live in a ""rooming"" house, but have my own room and pay rent weekly. As of yesterday, and because of this, and I don't think he will be lenient about me being late or missing another week.

After two months I was in so much pain I couldn't sit up for more than a few seconds at a time. I couldn't game, no diagnosis, they just sent me home. I figured it was because I lacked insurance so I shopped around and found some I could afford. Still, they did a urine test and sent me home, completely ignored my other symptoms. I couldn't leave the house anymore, the pain was so bad I thought I'd collapse. I almost did a couple times, I'd find myself sitting down in the middle of the aisle at the grocery store.

I found a doctor who made house calls, told me I had GERD. He then referred me to a GI doctor and a neurologist, specialists that wanted over $450 just for an appointment! He put me on Nexium, the most expensive PPI on the market,  and gave me some medication to help with my shaking. I was shaking uncontrollably, I was in so much pain I couldn't help it. I was at the point where I'd try anything, I was so sick no amount of money was too much for relief. I was spitting up blood by this point.

The Nexium was $200 a bottle, and I was still spitting up acid when I ate anything. I can't even drink water without spitting up. By Feb I had refilled 3 times and that on top of what I had paid for him to refill my RX I'd spent over 700 dollars on a cure that did nothing miraculous for me. I still couldn't work, or sit up, was in constant pain, spitting up blood daily now, and the bastard refused to refill my RX anymore. He said he gave me ample time to see a specialist like he said, but I could not possibly have afforded it. Now I was back to having acid pain as well on top of everything. I went to the hospital after spitting up very bright red blood, but not for what was wrong with me. 

On the way there the EMT checked my blood sugar, then dumped in an ER room for 3 hours before they even took an x-ray. When they admitted me they did so to monitor my heart, I was literally vomiting up blood but they were completely unconcerned about that. The GI doctor on staff is for ""emergencies only"" as they put it. This was my 4th trip to the hospital in 6 months, it was the only time they'd done anything more than check my blood oxygen and made me piss in a cup. I got an RX for a generic Omeprazole that I took up until a month and a half ago, I ran out and could not get a refill for it. Now I take the OTC alternative, literally half the dosage I was taking, and I'm getting sicker every day.

I'm going to lose my home due to back taxes, let alone pay several thousand in taxes. I'll be out on the street soon and she'll go live with her mother, it upsets me so much I just want to cry, but if I did I would stop breathing because I can barely breath as it is. I can sit up for short periods of time, I've gotten used to the pain, but as soon as I eat or drink something it hurts so bad I want to die. As I stated before I can't ask you guys for medical advice, that's not what this sub is for. But I need to know what can I ultimately do at this point?

I've exhausted every resource I have, though i couldn't drive one the way i feel every day. What should I do from here?

Was urged by potentialloser to post again. 

So

For more background


Found a place about 21 miles east of Arlington, the kind of place I've been dreaming of living in since I was a kid. Rent is $250 a month, with a $50 deposit to hold it. I went there yesterday and put a deposit on it. The place is *mine*! Yayy!

Now I just have to get the RV there.

Was quite an expedition getting there. My car's radiator is broken

Drove 132 miles round trip that way. 16 hours each way just to get there, doing that.  Spent most of yesterday sleeping, to recover from that.

I did not receive any help with repairs to the RV--it too has a broken radiator. It also has extremely weak brakes

I had several redditors promise me help with RV repairs months ago, and impounds, draining me of funds, and the needed time for repairs (can't really take the RV apart for repairs on the street when it has to be kept ready to drive at all times to minimize police problems).

I realized it's faster and cheaper to just tow the RV as it is to the new place

It's a *big* motorhome though,000 pounds, and I do not have funds to both pay the move-in costs on the new space and the RV tow. 

An ordinary tow truck that tows cars and pickups won't cut it for this big beast. I'll need a big tow truck that can tow large heavy vehicles the 66 miles to my new home--the first home I've had in 15 years. And pretty much the ONLY kind of home I can afford on my extremely low fixed income (SSDI

So I am looking for a tow truck driver who can do this job

If we can do this, electricity, internet, stability. The police will finally be off my back, no more parking tickets, no more impounds, no more police harrassment. I can finally move forward with my life and focus on getting an online business started so I can supplement my income and get out of poverty. The predators will be *gone*.

If I *don't* get the motorhome towed to the new space (The move in date is August 4)

So I lose the motorhome if I don't get this moved to my new home on August 4.

I've posted to /r/Seattle before for local help but they downvote me to  oblivion. Mean folks in there. 

Not really asking for money--just need a tow. Some how

The old complex took out rent for June (even though we were moved out) and caused the security deposit (not rent) to bounce.  I found about the mistake

Flash forward to two months ago, we have no idea how that got on there!  Sorry!""  and I ask them to take it off.  They say it will be taken off.  Flash forward to this month, still in the court system, I go back and say, ""Hey, what happened with this,"" and they say that once a judgement is entered there's no going back.

Nevermind the fact that it's an erroneous judgement since I paid within the 5 days of the notice (actually the day I got it) and I also paid the legal fees ($300) which was supposed to stop this from happening. 

I called the courts, and I have no idea what kind of lawyers I need.

So

1.  What kind of lawyer would I need
2.  Is there anyway I can get the complex to pay for the lawyer?
3.  Is this something I can do relatively easily myself?  And by easily

What I have is an entirely automated excel document that can help in long term planning.  Currently my excel document forecasts the next year for my needs and resources

First you put in how much money you have on hand. and your last pay date.
Next you put in how much money you make bi-weekly (but the rate of pay can be changed to however you want it)
Then you input the frequency in which you wish to set money aside for bills.  I am still climbing out of debt so the frequency I put money aside is when the bill is due

Then you watch the magic.  It completely automates your payments, and remaining balances.  It really helps you plan in the long term to see what the effects of for example even spending 10 dollers more in gas a week will do to your budget long term.

Additionally it is modified so that it can monitor activity in accounts based on initial value and current rate of payments.  This way you can see the long term affects of working hard and paying the debt at specific rates will result in.

I'm a twenty-two-year-old woman, housebound.  I'm taking care of my grandparents, who had adopted me, so now I refer to them as mother and father.

Father is on his deathbed.  He's a ninety-five-year-old veteran, he has alzheimers, and it is at a late stage.  His body is shutting down, and we are watching him die.

Since I still live with them, clean him, change him.  I also fix things around the house, clean, move things, and in general, I do whatever needs to be done.

Mother, but has been having troubles with her back and hip.  She's not capable of half of what she could do last year at this time.

We just got father back out of a nursing home, we thought we were utterly screwed until he died.

The VA has finally decided to get around to pushing papers here and there, but all good things that have come to us have always bitten us in the ass when we weren't looking.

The rest of our family heavily disagrees with us on keeping him home.  They keep trying to force mother into accepting different plans, to pay for his care in the nursing home.

Since they've been unable to budge her, of all great seasons, they've turned their hostility onto me.

They insult me, they're terminating my phone contract because I cannot pay for it myself, even though mother has asked to pay for it in my stead.  Did I use that word right?

The point is, and I've got dozen of job hunt applications on it that I actually use.

The problem is, then they'll still take the damn thing away from me.

So I guess what I'm asking for here, advice...  Pretty much over the following;

How to help my mother through this time.  She's watching her husband of almost fifty years die before her eyes.

How to tackle this problem with my siblings

And should my phone be terminated

And maybe someone has suggestions for a way I can get an income from home?  I don't think there are any from-home jobs open in the area that are within my qualifications, but it might be worth it if I can do it in my spare time.

I don't know what I'm really asking.  I just wish that everything could be laid out, and assigned proper answers.

Hope I didn't waste anyone's time.

For the past three or so years, simply because it makes things easier (I have a bad habit of losing checks and other important things). Around that time, I won $100 from a scratch off lottery ticket, and instead of using it on fun irresponsible things like a 20 year old should, I opened a savings account, separate from my checking account, at a completely different bank. (PNC). At each job I ever got after that, 10 dollars going to my savings and the remainder to my checking (at an entirely different bank, only if I came to him in an absolute emergency. (I even went as far as to sign a direct deposit form

Its been three years since I opened that account, they still threaten every other day), phone bill past due, rent behind (we're not on a lease, so we're pretty fucked in that department), no food, no gas, payday not for another week...what a perfect time to dip into the rainy day fund

""LOL WUT?"" says PNC.

Turns out, where I no longer live, and they ignored them, thinking it was junk mail or whatever. Obviously I didn't respond. They closed the account, took my money (roughly $1500, not including interest), and here's the best part: until last week when I found this out, but instead of putting it in the (now closed) account

I'll keep things short on this part since I'm not seeking legal advice from reddit, as they are too small to make money off of the interest alone, and since there are never any withdrawals, cannot make any money off check/debit card fees or overdraft fees. He fought a few cases just like this over the past decade and lost every single one (he's a good lawyer, too, he has really helped in the past for all sorts of things).

So

tl;dr PNC stole all my money, I am begging. I don't know where else to turn. Please, please, please, anyone. Thank you.

My friend, dragging the motorcycle, before stopping to finally try and remove it.  

A passerby saw a man on the side of the road drunkenly struggle to remove a motorcycle from under his car, he has denied being part of the accident.  This guy has apparently had several arrests already for accidents related to drinking and driving, one of which was a hit run!  Police are running blood samples from his car windshield to confirm DNA to Trevor Ware.

Trevor is now in a coma at UAMS Hospital with many life threatening injuries.  The doctors removed part of his skull to relieve the mounting pressure on his brain.  They are leaving him in a coma until the swelling comes down and the rest of his injuries have a chance to heal.  Doctors have said this will be anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months.  His other injuries include a broken femur close to the hip bone, and many scrapes and lacerations.  The neurosurgeon has told the family that surprisingly there may be no permanent brain damage and that there is a chance that his other injuries are also recoverable.  He just needs to make it the three weeks without complications or infection to bring him out of the coma.

The douchebag drunk driver was ticketed in JULY, I highly doubt this guy is going to have the money to cover Trevor's mounting hospital bills.  The family is asking for donations through this [website](https://www.everribbon.com/ribbon/view/8352).  Every dime adds up.  

Equally if not more important, can you show my buddy that there are better people in the world besides douchebag drunk drivers who can't even apologize for their douchebaggery?!

The vet called me and said Penny has begone accepting solid food. Turkey slices and boiled chicken. They will be taking her off injectables and start giving her oral medication. Penny is taking steps in the right direction.

Penny is home! Doctors let me take her home saying that they were confident in her being able to continue her treatment of antibiotics at home. She's eating soft food and drinking on her own.

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, hurt, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control. 

Today

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, drowned

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job. 

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything

**EDIT: PROOF:**
I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.

**Edit** - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

**Edit**

I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral. 

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male.

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda.

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed.

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the highway during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots.

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. They're mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes.

UPDATE: I was given $100 as an early birthday present from a friend i havent talked to in years. So now i only need $400.

I posted in r/loans yesterday but i was told this subreddit would be better. I recently posted in this subreddit asking for help again too. 

I have to come up with $300 or im gonna be homeless. I am going to be as honest as i can be so please hear me out.

I have been asking for help for things recently as I lost my job (late too many times (3 times in 3 weeks) due to no reliable transportation and no driver's license) a month ago. I was doing side jobs to get by but I finally just got a new job today and its a good one. I had my rent money in my wallet but it was stolen sometime when i was riding the public bus I think. Now i only have 2 days to get that money somehow. I would try getting a small loan but I have the worst credit due to identity theft while i was in the Marines. I haven't gotten it fixed but the person finally wasn't able to put anything else in my name so i can start to fix it. But this is keeping me from getting a loan. I had a car but i had to get rid off it when it broke down because the payments were too high

At the moment, pay for anything really. I just begged a friend to get me something off the dollar menu at McDonalds for dinner tonight.

But i have learned my lesson and I wont carry that much cash around in my wallet anymore. I do have a bank account but i wanted to just hand the cash over tomorrow morning to my landlord but now that's not gonna happen.

At this new job, the 8th of July. I can pay you back, up to $100, then and get on a regular paying schedule of up to $100 every check until i pay it off, plus some interest for helping me out in my time of need.

And i don't want to pull the sad cards as the #1 reason why i need help but I really have nothing. And i finally have this one hope but then this happens.

So i need exactly $300 and it's all going to rent and that's it. Im willing to take whatever you offer of course

If you can only lend me $20, I will pay it all back plus 20% interest. And I won't take more than the $300 I actually need whether its from one person or a dozen. 

I use reddit everyday and I promise, facebook page, email address, etc. I would give you a phone number but my iphone broke last week and I can't afford to buy a new one right now, i didnt have phone insurance.

A little bit about me. Im 21 years old. I am completely independent and i don't live with parents/family. I have been on my own for 3 years now. I have been buying my own clothes, car insurance, etc since i was 15. My father kicked me out on my 18th birthday, right before I went off to college (which i couldnt afford and had to drop out after one semester). I was in the Marines for one year before getting a rib infection and receiving a Honorable Discharge for Medical Reasons. I am all cleared for work now but I can't apply for benefits until I turn 24. I can't go back into the Military until then either. I love sports, especially basketball. I love pets and I wanna be a vet. I have no criminal record, one traffic violation but it was dismissed in court, I have never been in any trouble in school. I have always been fairly quiet and shy. At every job I have had I was the favorite. I won many employee of the months and promotions. And one time I won a free nintendo wii on the radio for getting the worst christmas gift (furniture/couch fixer kit from my dad when i was 19 and i didnt have a couch)

My hope is that when others hear my story, to greatly improve my health, safety and quality of life.

This is from their website (https://www.facebook.com/events/445196962202171/). They are a good and loving family and I just want to help more than I actually can.
""You may know Don Mott from his time dedicated to serving on the Steele Canyon Board, or cheer dad. You may know him as a loving father, a member of your family, or a loyal friend. He stands proud to all these titles, and humbly lives his life as each of these, with a beaming smile and open arms. 

At the core of his being Don has always known he is most happy being a father of three, optimistic, and disciplined he was sure another career opportunity would come. By December, Don was still unemployed but feeling hopeful. 

His life was then turned upside down when in that month he suffered from three heart attacks. On December 13th, Don remained in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for a week before he could return home to his three daughters. 

Now at home, hospital bills, and his inability to work, the family is asking the community for help.""

For now I won’t go into detail about how I got in this situation or what I’ve done in the past to try to get out

I am a 21 year old female with two dogs. One is a 13 year old mutt that I absolutely can't part with, and I have been in several abusive relationships in the past, one involving rape and threats of blackmail on a very regular basis. I was able to escape from all of that for close to 2 years, and had a very successful life during that time. But everything kept going wrong, and eventually the PTSD and anxiety caught up with me and things started going downhill.

I ended up back with my parents and have been here since April. They constantly put me down and make me feel worthless. To them, no in-betweens. They interrogate me for several minutes every time I leave my room, not because of any trust issues but just to be nosy and controlling. They yell at me or cry every time I talk to them, because they say I always have an attitude or are giving them angry looks, when I'm not even mad and didn't mean to, and honestly didn't realize if I was. I’m always told how I haven’t said a kind word to them in months, and they yell at me for backtalking when I bring up examples of when I did. We get in stupid arguments, and then when I react in even the smallest way (which I try not to), not letting anyone else talk

It's really confusing because I KNOW they love me and don't mean it. It makes me feel like it is all fault. In front of friends, they are so proud of me, that I’m so smart and talented, and that I “just don’t realize it yet” and that’s why I’m “not making the right decisions with my life”. They say they are so happy I’m back at home with them again. They make sure I have everything I need, plus some. They pay for my food, insurance, doctor bills. They even pay for my dogs' food and vet visits. They occasionally let me drive my car (which is registered to them, as long as I give them very specific details of what I’m going to do and get home before dark, because “most parents wouldn’t do so much for their children”. They always refuse to believe anything negative I have told them about how my parents treat me or what has happened in my life

I have tried talking to my parents very calmly, and then guilt me for being such a burden to them all the time. Then they start turning it around, blaming themselves for “raising me wrong”, trying to reason that everything bad that I do is their fault. The other common reaction that happens is that mom will immediately start to cry for being ""a failure as a parent"", and telling me that “I will regret everything I’ve done to them when they are dead”. Then dad will get violent and because I upset her, even if he has absolutely no idea what happened. He will get in my face and yell until I am in tears. Since I've turned 18 he's mostly refrained from hitting me unless I ""acted out"", which was only when he physically cornered me or held me against a wall

To make things even more conflicting, and he started chemo last week. They said that some of the medications they gave him during chemo, especially the steroids, could cause him to be in a bad mood. And by bad mood they apparently meant both him and mom, at every chance they got, accusing me of not caring about them at all and ruining their lives. I mean, I'm very sympathetic and understanding about what he’s going through, and in my opinion

I had a tiny bit of confidence left when I moved back here, wondering if I’m right or wrong. Anything from leaving my room to use the bathroom, to going outside for a walk, I’m terrified that I will get yelled at for something I didn’t mean to do or say. I never trust myself enough to know whether I was the cause of an argument or if they really were being unreasonable. I want to get out of here, I want to get away from abuse forever and be treated like a human for once in my life. But I know that if I escape it again, it will probably end in failure again because of my PTSD and anxiety, which is so bad sometimes that it is absolutely disabling.

I feel like a terrible, and all I can think about is running away from my problems. I know they won’t live forever, and I want to make the most of the time I have with them, but at the same time I want to protect myself. But I’m afraid to even do that because it might upset them…

I have tried everything to get out of here. None of my friends can help, suicide hotlines, talked to therapists. I've tried literally everything that's been recommended to me, and I have no idea where I can go, even *without* my dogs!

I'm willing to find a temporary home for my puppy until I get back on my feet, sometimes he is the only thing keeping me motivated to live at this point. I have no other reason, and I think about that a lot. It worries me.

I have a friend across the US that might be able to help me. My current plan, especially with winter coming up and without a solid plan for once I get there, but I really don't care at this point. I can't take this much longer. But every opportunity I’ve gotten, I can’t seem to get myself to leave, because of this constant fear of their reaction to it.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what other options I have. It seems like there HAS to be some way to get out of this

I really hate to ask for help from people that I don’t know, whether it is some advice on what I can do, a temporary or permanent home for my puppy, resources where I can get help, anything. I fully intend to pay it forward when I'm able, whether it's repayment to the people who help me or in the form of giving help to others. This is a throwaway account, and I'm willing to PM mods or anyone from my active account if it is needed for anything.

Thank you all so much for anything you can offer

Whenever my wife goes to sleep no matter how long she has been asleep she will sleep for 12+ hours and I have seen her sleep for over 36 hours....when I attempt to wake her she either dosent wake up or enters a fit of rage. And then immediately falls back asleep. It takes at least a good 1.5 hours to wake her up some times even 3 hours. It is affecting our relationship and since I work nights has caused our 4 yr old son excessive tadys at school and a couple of times I've gotten home from work and my wife is asleep and my son is wondering around the house. One time he was crying his eyes out. Luckily I get home at 8 am so it's never that long that he's awake for. It is also affecting her job causeing excessive lateness... Please help reddit

Edit

I believe it's a condition I've done a bit of research (an hour or so) and apparently a lot of people have this problem....we've been to a doc and he suggested ambein ( worng spelling) and that only made the problem worse doc said it was prob due to her not getting restful sleep

Edit

We've done a sleep study and results were negative for apnea she only had approx 9 interruptions during the study. As far as depression she goes to a psychologist regularly and was on depression for about two years but hasn't had a problem with depression in over a year and half so we discontinued use of the medication. We tried a cpap machine for apnea anyway ( my father has apnea and has a home and travel unit) and that was no help ( was used for 2 weeks straight)

I'm Mike O'Brien and I could use your help.
For the past 4 years I've been trying to get a heart transplant and because of the heart defect I was born with I was shot down over and over again.

Why?
Because no adults have heart transplant with my heart defect. There have been successful transplants on children but because most people don't survive into their adulthood it's very rare to see an adult with a Fontan
and Protein Losing Enteropathy.

What changed?
After hounding Doctors for years, adult Immunologist, adult heart failure and transplant surgeon and I will soon be seeing the pediatric heart failure and transplant surgeons.

Everyday I get closer and closer to achieving what I always felt was the impossible. But I never gave up, travel,food costs, rent,etc. Everything is piling up.
What about insurance?
I have two insurances already; medicare and medi-cal. However transplants can cost millions of dollars. And there are lifelong costs afterwards. The drug costs,food,etc. A lot of the transplant medications are not covered by insurance due to most of them being very experimental. And yes, they are very very expensive.

The first 6 months to a year after the transplant will cost more money than I can even imagine right now. And they will be the most difficult for me health wise due to possible rejection

The $5000 I'm asking for isn't going to even come close to covering the next year for me

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
I also have a blog at http://apaleoheart.com

I can put up as much information as possible. I'll try my best to make a video when I'm feeling better(sick right now) and I'll post a letter from one of my previous cardiologists about my medical history.

As a result, I quickly began making arrangement to leave for San Diego and the alternative care treatment that we believe will save Thomas’ life.""

This caused the anticipated nausea, and of course, the extreme weight loss and depression that follows. Soon after we arrived in San Diego Thomas was rushed to Children's Hospital Emergency facility due to a new tumor that rapidly began growing during the eight week period of waiting with NO Treatment, after Children’s Hospital said there was nothing more they could offer Thomas. Thomas was in uncontrollable, excruciating pain that could have been prevented weeks before, but by that time the tumor began pressing on the nerves in his lower back. From the facility, 45 minutes away - Thomas literally passed out in the car on the way to the hospital! We spent the next 14 days at Children’s where Thomas underwent 6 rounds of painful radiation and had to be transported by ambulance daily that required a 30 minute trip to and from the radiation center.

Hi Reddit. I'm a graduate student and a former kindergarten teacher. I live in California and am working my way through school. 

This summer, her dad is in prison, and she lives in a run-down migrant village on the outskirts of town. 

Yiming is an amazing child. I've taught and been around a lot of kids in my days of teaching, spunky, and warm-hearted 11-year-olds I have ever met. I wish I could tell you all the stories I have about her. 

The long and short of it, for-profit, low-quality migrant school that does not tap her potential at all. As a migrant, she is barred from attending the local public school, and as the child of a single mother, she cannot return to her hometown for education. 

Very near her house is an excellent nonprofit school for talented students -- but it's four times as expensive (to cover the more-qualified teachers' salaries). I visited the school

This September, although she has struggled to overcome her deficit in preparation, her intelligence and hard work have given her significant improvement in the past few months. If she continues to be enrolled, she has a great chance of testing into high school, and out of the cycle of migrant exclusion and poverty. 

Although it's hard to imagine an American private school that costs this little

There's so much to her story

Over the last four months, and leaves her audibly wheezing.  She didn't (couldn't) go to a doctor when it started, and it's been getting steadily worse.  I've been doing everything I can to help her through this.  Through trial and error, we're pretty sure it's not a food or environmental allergy, so that only leaves something internal, like asthma, or worse.  

A friend-of-mine's father is a pulmonary doctor, crippling, and ProAir inhalers do little-to-nothing to help her breath easier.  (She has to take 5+ ""hits"" of the inhaler for it to have any effect, and, one, it leaves her jittery and unable to do one of her jobs, and, it's close to ODing, just in case, it was possible.  Unfortunately

She's Deaf.  Her disability makes it very hard to get by in a normal environment.  If you know Deaf, and non-understanding some (c'mon, *most*) hearing people can be.  (You won't believe me, but we've been given Braille Menus in restaurants.  ...  Think about that for a sec.)  However, despite that, she has been repeatedly turned down for SSI assistance.  She has five part time jobs.  Four.  Some of them are incapable of promoting her to full-time due to her disability (eg: managers are required to answer phones, so she can't be bumped up to manager), a private tutor, gas, that's not a typo; she banked ten dollars last month.  (Why is it so little?  For starters

""What about insurance?"" you ask.  It's true, and left her bleeding and with with a concussion.  It was almost an hour before we could find her (the only thing she could text me on the phone was that she was by a big cherry cafe) and take her to the ER for a cat-scan.  Not only did it eat up all the insurance, but stuck her with a $1,700 medical bill to pay off.  Now the insurance will only pay for 30% of ""approved"" procedures.

But wait, brutally raped.  When she reported it to the local authorities, they didn't believe her (as they were good friends with the man who did it) and ""advised"" her to leave town, which she did, which is how I ended up meeting her.  She was crashing on someone's couch, having just fled that incident.  The guy she was crashing with had taken her to the hospital.  (The doctors there berated her, saying it was her fault for being raped.  Yes, cowering in a corner, HRRG finally caught up with her

At this point, *extremely* important medical tests that need to be done, and banking a whopping $10/mo, she (and I!) is doing everything possible to try and make things square.  She turned off her cell phone.  She eats once, sometimes twice a day, and only steamed vegetables and quinoa (since it's cheap and still relatively healthy).  She avoids driving whenever possible, and tries to bike to places (which is risky in itself; people get mugged in her neighborhood very frequently).  You might think, I would probably start selling off my belongings if it were that bad.""  And you'd be right!  Except, I'm still going backwards, put it in his mother's attic

And then there's me.  I've been doing what I can for her, but it's not going well.  I made $5,500 last year in total.  I'm up to $3,800 for this year.  Still, I've given her about $800 to help with medical bills and living expenses, buy her food whenever I can, and am calling in every favor I can think of to try and help.  Plus, so hopefully she can start eating a little better.

And now it's come down to this.  Asking random Redditors for help.  I admit, I don't have a lot of choices left.  The doc thinks she may have something very serious wrong with her, and we need to find out what it is.  Unfortunately, the pulmonary xray is going to cost about $200, and the other test he mentioned (I forgot the name, some sort of drug-breathing test) is somewhere between $600 and $1,000 from the hospital (the only place to get it done).  If her insurance approves it, but we're still looking at $800

For a story like this, so I don't really know what constitutes proof.  I took a photo of her month-trial inhalers and one of the scars left over from the accident, so there's something.  Not much, I know, but something.    (\*edit\* what the hell, I'll put them up.  Links at the bottom.)  I was thinking about taking a photo of the medical bills when they come in, but that's not really ""proof"" either, and all the personal information I'd have to black out (for obvious reasons).  So...  yeah

Hello. My name is Tyler, if you have my type. Normally i'd never ask for others help with money, but we're hurting financially, and pretty significantly. 

Our wheelchair accessible van had broken down a few months back, completely. Only able to roll myself a few blocks down, until stopped with incredibly steep curbs. 

My dad had lost his job last year

My parents are really great people, to living paycheck to paycheck. They've also recently taken in one of my best friends because he had nowhere to go. 

The repairs for our current van are astronomically expensive (Engine, and using a program to get our current lift transferred over.

I myself have talked to countless program directors

So we're in a pretty big bind. Every single donation is deep heartedly appreciated. I put the donation at 10, every single cent will be put toward a better van.

I've been working as a web developer and PC tech

For the last 2 1/2 years since my daughter was born I've been her 24/7 parent. Part of this was because my wife was working full time at a store, but lately trying to get some of them to pay has been like pulling teeth.

The stress finally got to my wife a month ago and she left me and took our daughter. She went away to another state. I've begged her to return

My wife also took her last paycheck from her job, and I've used what little I had to pay the electric bill and for internet access and phone, and soon those will be overdue too. In a couple of weeks I'm pretty sure I'm going to be evicted, and then my wife won't have anywhere to come home to if she decides to come back. I miss her and my daughter terribly, and the depression is almost incapacitating, but I'm still trying.

I need to have $1, so I can't go back to my family and ask for more. They don't have it.

I feel terrible asking strangers for help

If anyone out there actually reads these and could help me out and help me save my family and get a little more time to find a job

Also, paint, sculpt, Photoshop, do vector art with Illustrator, or even make 3-D art with 3DS Max or Mudbox. If someone wants to donate some money to me in exchange for artwork for any purpose or if anyone wants a web site, I have web space pre-paid from when I started my business.

But if you ask my students where they dream of going to college, Title 1 students I teach, reaching these schools is tougher because their families cannot afford to expose them to these opportunities (due to managing multiple jobs, limited funds for trips, etc.).


I am setting up a field trip to the University of Southern California (my alma mater) next November. They will see what it's like to be a college freshman -- from seeing the dorms, and observing a lab with current college students. The students had to apply for the trip, and after thoughtful considerations, 20 total freshmen, sophomores, and juniors were selected.


This experience will change their lives -- but they need your help. All of my students come from low-income families who cannot afford to pay for this life changing trip. As a result



A lot of people think these students should ""stay local"" and consider community colleges instead. Why do they have to be limited? Why is it acceptable for a child from a middle class family to move thousands of miles away for college

1337365156.0,ttlhm,"Reddit, I am at the end of my rope.  Is there anyone out there that can help me?",shinjo101788,32,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ttlhm/reddit_i_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_is_there_anyone/

I am a 23 year old male that has been living with constant pain, Reddit, with hopes that someone out there would be able to offer me some form of help, an answer to my supplication for some reprieve from this pain.  I am a foster child, I have been since the age of 12, and have aged out of the system.  I essentially have nobody and I feel incredibly alone and scared.  I have been going to counseling to help cope with my symptoms, but the sessions only serve to shed more light on how grim and hopeless my situation is - it makes me realize that it would be better for me to end things myself as opposed to living in constant pain.  I am bound by my own cowardice, and could never see myself doing something like that



About 5 years ago I developed really bad migraine headaches out of the blue.  The headaches were not that bad, ultimately turning in to a debilitating ailment.  Initially, the pain would occur in the area of my forehead and would be accompanied by a strong pressure and pain sensation in the back of my right eye.  I saw a neurologist for the pain, and was prescribed some Atenolol (50mg Daily) to help manage the pain - this did not work at all.  It is important to note that early on my headache episodes were intermittent, but have now graduated to always being present.  



Roughy six months went by and I did not get better, I had a similar experience after going for a jog.  I came home and right when I was going to take off my shirt to go take a shower, I was overcome with an extreme feeling of dizziness and my vision, again, became blurred.  I distinctly remember my vision being blurred because I was looking at my alarm clock just as I was about to take off my shirt, the numbers immediately transitioned from being legible to a big red blur.



It was at this point where my headaches developed into a constant pain, my headaches were exacerbated to the point where I could not do anything anymore, and my sense of taste and smell were severely affected by the pain.  As it stands now, my sense of taste and smell share an inverse relationship with the pain and pressure I feel in my head - the more pain and pressure I feel, the less I am able to taste and smell.



This was where I became worried that something was seriously wrong with me.  I went to see countless specialists ranging from ENT’s, dentists, allergists, and chiropractors. I have had, so far, two sinus surgeries - bilateral turbinate reduction and septoplasty, which both did not help my pain or my sense of taste and smell.  I have been on countless regimens of antibiotics, and special diets - none of which has worked for me.  A couple of months ago I was prescribed Nortiptyline (30mg Daily) (50mg Daily) (75mg Daily) which did not work for me despite the increases in dosage.  The neurologist I saw thought I had a bad case of migraines and said the medication would act as a preventative measure


I recently saw a dentist that said two of my teeth, in an act of desperation I agreed to the extraction which has also done nothing for me.  Being sick of all the failed attempts to find a correct diagnoses and a chance at living a normal life again, I went to Syracuse Upstate Medical’s Headache Clinic for a possible answer - this was a week and a half ago.  I told the neurologist about my symptoms and updated them on how the symptoms have developed.  As it stands right now, I have pain and pressure in between my eyebrows (above my nose) that is always present and that fluctuates in severity.  The pain then resonates to the roof of my mouth, into my eyes (which now have a burning sensation), and to the crown of my head.  Accompanying this pain is sometimes, not always, stuffy nose



I was so happy that I had some form of an answer that made sense and was consistent with my symptoms.  I started the Indomethacin last Tuesday and it has only served to harm me, only to get up to fulfill my responsibilities as a CS graduate student and TA.  Despite all of my ailments, I still am able to maintain a 4.0 GPA - I literally live to do school work, nothing more.  This is no way for me to live and I can’t see myself going on like this much longer.  I have no enjoyment in my life and every single moment I am alive I am suffering and am in pain.  I am constantly being strung along with diagnosis, after diagnoses, which never seem to materialize to anything.  I am alone and scared and have reached the point where my level of discouragement has reached its precipice - I just feel like giving up.  I have worked hard for everything in my life and fear that I will not be able to support myself if I continue to be ill.



If there is anyone out there that can offer me some help, I just want this chapter of my life to be over with.  I feel as if my whole life has been on pause because of this debilitating mystery illness that has taken everything away from me. Please feel free to send me a PM, reply to this post, or forward this around if you have any idea what may be wrong with me or if you know of any way I can be helped - I will be sure to look at every comment sent to me.  From the deepest depths of my heart, and with the utmost sincerity, thank you Reddit.

(Xpost)",GreatSince86,37,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/nlpc5/reddit_i_need_your_help_xpost/, as I’m just starting to type this I am already tearing up from what has been a horrible month for my family. I’m asking for two types of assistance for them… monetary and advice. My step-father Bill and my mother Pam decided two years ago they were going to try for their dream. They had the crazy idea to move out to the Peoria, for their business to be unique. Business finally started to take off and they were making tons of money which they just turned around and put right back into the business. 

   Well, that they were going to have to close up shop. For two years, business went up and down and they loved every high and low… but closing that place broke their hearts. But as my parents are very strong people they moved on and naturally my father with his new found popularity in the Peoria area, found a job rather quick. Which was needed since they had sunken almost everything they had into their dream (which after taking loses on selling out house here and other financial problems from passing relatives, wasn’t that much). 


   Not long after is when a series of such horrible events happen that it would almost seem impossible for such a travesty to happen to such good people. My mother who has had a series of brain tumors in her life, we got a badass over here.” But not in the rage comic sarcastic sense, but in the real life sense.The incident happened the day she came home after surgery, it came with a single phone call. My father had been into an accident and was in route to the nearest hospital. He had apparently fallen off a ladder, which my mom thought couldn’t be that bad… how she couldn’t have been more wrong. Hours go by and my mother still has no details until finally my father gets ahold of her and is in tears. 


   He had what was called an upper pilon fracture. Now, but I have nowhere else to turn to at this point. I recently lost my job, but am ok myself for a couple of months. My parents don’t know what to do or where to turn in this matter. My mother can’t work for some time and my father certainly can’t and they have NOT received any kind of workman’s comp checks in anyway. The boss my dad works for is apparently shady, and doesn’t even pay into some members benefits the way he’s supposed to.


   Now, and they basically used what they had had left to put food on the table for my younger brother and sister and pay Decembers mortgage and utilities. My mother just told me, as my father is in surgery that they only have 13 dollars in the bank and she has no idea what they are going to do. Now, my father was injured on a union job, so you would think that he would be entitled to his full amount of benefits? Apparently, this is not so and he is only going to be entitled to 80% of 30 hours of his rate due to how the person he was working for did things. Apparently, he paid my father by check for 30 hours then by cash for 10, I don’t believe anything in life comes for free… so for every 500 dollars for my family that is donated I will personally volunteer 40 hours at various (even your choice) shelters or with community projects throughout the city. For every 1000 dollars donated I will not only volunteer 80 total hours


   I am attaching some pictures that I myself have been too afraid to look at. I will e-mail the medical documents to a mod or post them. Whichever is necessary. I am unfamiliar with how the donation process works

Thank you guys. The short story is that Loki ate a ton of string which destroyed her insides. Thanks to some amazing doctors and nurses she has survived so far. Unfortunately her intestines are still not functioning.


Loki was rescued when she was a tiny little baby, to drink, and basically was and is their mother. She and her sisters are 6 years old now.


We noticed her withdrawing and not eating (she is a very social cat and loves to eat). We took her to the vet and they found that she had string basically cinching her intestines together into a tiny little ball. After a six hour surgery all of the string was removed. They had to cut her stomach open once


Since then she has been touch and go. Her pancreas is in very bad shape from the string and the surgery, purring, looking around. She is in a bad way but still has a 50% chance of making it if they can treat her pancreas and get her intestines processing food.


If we can afford to keep her in the hospital, we can have our baby home and happy.

this is where i swallow my pride because i am out of options at the moment.

I am on a fixed income, and desperately missing my child.",LolTurdFerguson,39,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/19jiff/i_have_been_alienated_from_my_daughter_for_over_a/

Basically, and my husband and I were stuck financially.  My ex husband swooped in like a vulture, and saw his chance to finally relinquish custody from me.

I was presented with a temporary custody order (and assured by his lawyers and himself) that it would ONLY be temporary

At that time, she would sleep over my house and I would transport her to school.

My ex husband assured me I didn't have to pay the child support (he was working a Government job and making a ton of money

I didn't pay him the child support (which was never ordered through DHR

Fast forward last year.  He started to become VERY bitter towards me (with no specific reason given).  He started talking bad about me to my daughter (she would confide in me
Then

He said it was because she was ""tired"" for school.  Unfortunately

Last month, it had spread to my other children and myself.  Not a big deal.  We got the infestation under control, and everything seemed to be going smoothly.  

My husband called me and told me ""we need to talk"".  I know what this means.  He is a severe control freak.  He continued to berate me and tell me that the lice infestation was originating at my house.  I, indeed, lice free.  He refused to believe me, so I got 3 different written statements and head inspections on my entire family.  One was by our family pediatrician.

Still a no go.  He refuses to let her come to my house.  Without any reason.  

He uses material possessions to bribe her.  Giving her things I could never afford.  Dangling things like new game systems and kindle's in her face.

He told me he will NOT let me see my daughter, indeed, her biological mother, and very much would like have that sort of privilege with my own flesh and blood.)

He also stated that he would NOT tell me the reason

Whenever I tell him that his withholding of visitation is illegal (I am a certified Paralegal..I've dealt with this before)

So

The bummer?  It will cost 1

So I come here, or see her infectious smile is indescribable.  It is like she has died to me.  I am unable to contact her (except for her 1 sentence texts she sends me when she can), and I just have this gaping hole in my heart.

My husband has been in my daughters life since she was two years old.  She is now 11.  He misses her just as much as I do.  My other children cry for her.  This is unfair

I came here to see if I could receive ANY assistance (whether monetary, and so down.

Being poor feels like a prison.  The only thing I can offer my daughter is my unconditional love.  But according to my ex husband

**Update** - I decided to be a bit ballsy and ask my ex if I could take my daughter out to lunch (with my mother and other children present

The only way I can see her is if I visit her on his porch.  This is such bullshit!  

**Update 2** - Legal Services rejected my application for help.  They rely on Federal funding, that they will not waste their time with my situation.  They did tell me, however, that if I had criminal charges, it would be a different story.  *sigh*.

So

My girlfriend and I, gorgeous wood floors, over 1000sq ft... awesome place to live...

Not so much. [This is what we found the night we pulled into town.](http://imgur.com/a/zKoc5) No walls

I should say that the arrival date was confirmed many times over the last 2 months and I was assured in every possible way that the apartment would be ready and waiting. In addition to it being completely unfinished and unlivable its also about half the size promised.

We went from riding a super-happy-high of finally getting to our new place after a long drive to super depressed and thinking we'd possibly made the biggest mistake of our lives. There was a single room provided (with no airflow or AC) in the rest of the hotel with an old lumpy mattress that we and all our animals were supposed to live in till the apartment was done. est time to completion ""about 2 weeks""

This room had holes in the walls

Luckily I have family down in Moab so we put all our stuff in a 10x20 storage locker and drove about 2 hours south to see my sister and my mom who both live in town. We're essentially ""couch surfing"" with all our pets and some clothes in suit cases till we can find a place to live.

The #1 issue we've run into is finding a half way decent place that allows pets. We have a few prospects but they aren't available till October at the earliest. 

We just put an ad in the local paper that comes out tomorrow hoping someone who sees it will have a place. We've been through pretty much all of the local realty companies and haven't had any luck yet.

I'm an independent web developer and have plenty of work right now. Keeping my clients happy is crucial so my girlfriend is handling most of the house-hunting so I can sit at the kitchen table and get work done on time. So at least I still have the ability to continue working through this. Far different from being able to move in and set up my home office though.

We spent most of the cash we had on the initial plan (truck rental, etc) so I'm doing my best to make enough money quickly that we can put down a security deposit on a new place, first months rent and then rent a new truck to move our stuff out of storage ~120 miles away and into the new place.

So

Anyway

Just for fun... [here are some instagram pics of our kitties and puppy](http://imgur.com/a/xw7Ol)

**Edit:** Yes it was *family* who did this to us. Yes I will still try to get whatever money I can back... even via court if it comes to that.

**Edit from comment below:** We did have a rental agreement and would have paid rent though so it's not like he was ""helping us out"" or anything. Just renting us a place at regular market value. Additionally we didn't have to leave the place we were in for like 6 more months if we didn't want to. We LOVED it in VA but decided to move because it seemed like a great/cool opportunity to explore a new place. The land we lived on in VA was going to be sold but if we liked the new owners we could have stayed there indefinitely.

We've lived in Berkeley

All I want to do is go back to San Francisco. I don't want to live anywhere else. My daughter loves it too. I'm not sure if that's only from me hyping it up so much or if it's truly her own opinion. We've gone there a lot just to hang out. She likes the buildings, the beach, the parks, etc.. I want her to grow up in a city, not in a suburb. I grew up in a suburb. I know it's ""safe"" and more affordable and all of that, but I want her to grow up with all of the positive and negative aspects of city life. If you live in a city by choice, then you know what I mean. If you live in the suburbs and think I should too, and it's a great place to be for someone pursuing a career in programming. 

I'm beginning to feel defeated. I've been calling and emailing people with studios and one-bedrooms that are explicitly said to be suitable for two people and I can't even get to the application process because these people all seem to be anti-children. They haven't even asked how old she is! One person even questioned whether I have custody or not. And when I do get to the application process, and that my mom is even willing to sign the lease and pay a small portion of my rent to make this happen, I have bad credit (no bankruptcies, evictions or foreclosures, just unpaid bills in collections).

We've always lived in one-bedroom apartments. My daughter has the bedroom to herself and I have the living room with a futon. She never used her room besides for sleeping. A studio wouldn't be a stretch at all for us as long as it's not a glorified storage room.

&gt;This reference suggests that a landlord’s policy that is more restrictive than two occupants per bedroom plus one additional occupant is suspect as being discriminatory.



&gt;Section 503(b), if three people were using a room to sleep, it would have to be at least 120 square feet. If four people were sleeping in one room, it would have to be at least 170 square feet.

I've paid for a first round of x-rays and his treatment overnight. He has a shattered left rear femur, and the vet is planning to amputate on Friday morning after he's more stable. He doesn't seem to have any internal injuries.

Reddit, and I'm sure he's someone's pet. The vet has alerted the shelters in case the owner calls for him, but in the meantime, I promised him that I wouldn't make any decisions based on the expense.

I asked the vet if people could call to make donations for Buck's treatment, matt@writingworksltd.com. I will NOT profit from this. Please give what you can so that we can save this beautiful dog. I promise full transparency; I will update with receipts for his care, and any donations in excess of that amount will be donated to the emergency vet who is treating him--they've already offered to operate at their cost. Please help!

Update: Thanks so much to each of you for your help with our four-legged friend over the last two days.  I'm sincerely touched by your generosity, or sent some positive thoughts his way.

So I run this [blog](http://filipethedinosaur.tumblr.com) about my toy
dinosaur Filipe
([that's the two of us!](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwKpl35W))

He's snarky and wonderful
batman](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwFarAAM) and I've put a lot of
sentimental value into him. Except he's gone missing. My best friend
[Claire loves Filipe too.] (http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwHmTEM3)

Unfortunately Claire and I had a small mix up while out on the town
and lost him. We each thought the other had him! We realized within 10 minutes what had happened but it seems it was too late. We've put up signs and a [craigslist ad](http://pittsburgh.craigslist.org/laf/2997766196.html) but we don't have a lot of faith he's coming back.

But being adults we are willing to accept he is a mass produced toy
and we can get a replacement. Except here's the problem

We know he was sold at Target in December 2011 from [this brand](http://www.toysmith.com/) with a tag that says ""Prehistoric Dinosaur!"". He shares an item number with [this
dinosaur](http://www.target.com/p/Toysmith-Soft-Dinosaur/-/A-13671924#?lnk=sc_qi_detailbutton) but is a green T-Rex with purple on his back

We've called every Target in a 20 mile radius of Pittsburgh with no luck. If they have a T-Rex

We've contacted the distributer and are waiting to hear back but again
it seems like a dead end. So at this point we're not sure what else to
do. We've seen Reddit pull amazing feats and we're hoping someone
somewhere has a Filipe they'd like to donate to the blog
someone's Target isn't sold out of them and they'd love to send us one? We'll pay for shipping and the toy! Or against all odds you live in Pittsburgh and have our Filipe and read reddit?


In return we can offer
1) eternal gratitude
2) the continuation of an epic blog
3) a feature on the blog
4) home made cookies of your choice sent express mail (Filipe helped
Claire make [these](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwDhlN3Y) delicious Oatmeal
Raisin cookies a while back )
5) friendship with two clearly awesome girls (I hear this is a big
deal on reddit?) 

Please help us not be [sad](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwLEYxbb) anymore.



Edit: We heard back from the manufacturer. He came in a special order for Target several years ago. Reddit

August has come and is going. She still doesn't have a job. My work has been slow lately, we acknowledge that even if she gets a job, it'd be mid-September before she gets her first paycheck.

So, but, I have been to a few Reddit meet-ups in LA, Pasadena, and Santa Monica and there are Reddit people who could verify that my fiancée and I are good people and we're in trouble.

So - there are people here, and their intentions are good, just like yours.

In light of recent scams and animosity

Get as much info as you can from your potential giftee. Reddit history is a good place to start. If they're really in dire straits, an address, the name of an employer or other reference, a phone number, or their own real name. Seeking charity is no time to be shy.

If you're suspicious or uncertain

If you don't feel comfortable sending someone money

The risk of getting scammed will ALWAYS exist - both here and in the real world. In the end

The veterinarian said that he would not have lived another 48 hours without the operation, and would have died a slow and agonizing death. I can't even think about that possibility, it never seemed like an option to just give up.


The vet was absolutely amazing, he began to cry and tremble in fear. Without even thinking, the vet wrapped his arms around him from behind and scratched his chest while gently kissing him on the head and telling him he was a good boy... Exactly how I comfort Bear when he is upset. He noticed me smiling at him with tears in my eyes and let go of Bear, with a look of embarrassment. He apologized and told me that was how he would comfort his own pet if they were in the same position. It was like an automatic reaction, he saw an animal in pain and immediately wanted to help them in any way he could. He took care of my baby as if he were his own. All of the staff were, in fact, amazing.


He made it through the surgery ok, is running a temperature and not feeling well, but he is slowly getting back to his old self... Eating like a monster, purring like a tank, sucking on his favorite blanket like the big baby that he is.


[Here](http://imgur.com/wiISEvR) he is immediately after coming home, softly purring into my ear. I never thought that I would have that chance again. 


It's a long road to recovery, and keep the cone around his neck for up to 10 days. He does not like the cone of shame :( I'm trying to spend as much time with him as possible so he can leave it off, we've been curled up in bed watching old cartoons. His favorites are Bugs Bunny &amp; Friends, Scooby Doo, and the old 60's Batman &amp; Spiderman.

A special thanks goes out to /u/mbacpa, /u/wisnowbird, Leah, Amanda, Ryan


Between our savings, we have managed pay off nearly $1100 of the $2900 bill. It's still a lot of financial stress to handle, but it's much more manageable thanks to your help. The donations received were used as a down payment for a surgeon and an OR on Sunday. A copy of the updated invoice can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/IJy4d2t), for those wanting to make sure their donations are being put to good use!  


If anyone would still like to help, and we would like to repay them as soon as possible. If any funds are raised above the total cost of surgery, they will be donated to the incredible clinic that made this all possible.


So Reddit, with a smile on his face and a new lease on life. I cannot believe the miracle you made happen...  And I cannot express the impact your generosity has had on me. Keep being awesome. 


Thanks to your help

To sum the situation up, right now, it twists sideways when he walks. He falls down a lot and has lost a LOT of muscle definition. When he lays down, it's like he loses feeling of it. It will be sticking out to the side and he'll start to roll over onto it, pushing it out unnaturally, but he doesn't seem to notice at all. We can't take him on more than one or two block long walks (and only on flat surfaces).

I know it says ""Baxter's leg brace"" but our most recent vet appointment showed that he might need anything from a brace for the good leg (to keep him from wearing it out), if he needs the surgery and two braces, we're looking at $4000+)

I'll be straight with you: we don't have that money. We're doing our best and putting money away for Baxter when we can

1360467674.0,188a0h,"18 year old Twin brothers, one who wanted to be a Marine and the other who wanted to join the army, diagnosed with a unnamed condition that causes their blood vessel walls to rip and tear easily. They have required many surgeries and one has been left a paraplegic.",soupx360a,34,3

Two of my friends from high school

&gt;18 year-old identical twin brothers, but it is aggressive and causes the blood vessel walls to rip and shred easily.  Within the past 12 months, Daniel has had 3 major operations, including open heart surgery, brain surgery and descending Aorta replacement surgery.  The most recent operation has left him paralyzed from the waist down.  Forrest has had open heart surgery and has been awaiting brain surgery for aneurysms.  Please read their story, as told by their father, Matthew Theiss.

 

&gt;In June of 2011, Ohio. Each boy carried dozens of 50 lb. boxes in and out of storage and into the RV we traveled in, along with 8 cats, 1 dog and 6 fish. For the next 5 months, everything was normal except for Daniel’s bout of double pneumonia and DVT in both arms. Once settled in Mason, Daniel ran cross country and Forrest began weight lifting and working out with the Marines in Lebanon as a poolee.

 

&gt;That December, to everyone’s surprise, he failed the physical because the doctor heard a slight heart murmur.  For a healthy young man who ran track for several years, it seemed unusual.  That same night, Daniel complained of severe stomach pain, so we took him to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Dissection (AAD). A subsequent thoracic echocardiogram revealed he also had an enlarged Aortic root.  At that point, including his mother, had an enlarged Aortic root

 

&gt;In hindsight, both boys have had stomach issues and were on high fiber diets. It was an “a-ha” moment, but no one expected this. Doctors considered their condition serious but not acute, although they could not assure us that their Aortas would not burst or critically dissect at any time. They definitely needed surgery to replace their Aortas, but the doctors were comfortable with waiting several weeks.  So, my wife and I reluctantly took them home and sent them back to school.  We created an emergency medical plan with the school nurse that stated if the kids feel acute pain in school, they were to be ambulanced to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital immediately.

 

&gt;In February 2012, being a teenager, Forrest had different plans and instead, first drove himself to the Marines recruiting center to hand in the medical prognosis that would lead to his medical discharge from the Marines. The ER was eventually notified that Forrest was on the way.  He sat in the ER for seven hours, receiving an X-ray and little care until about 9pm, when they finally did an MRI and at 10pm, told us that he needed emergency surgery because of an upper Aortic dissection. The surgeon then told us that he would not try to save Forrest’s own valves, I knew that if his valves were good, the doctors kept telling me he could die at any moment and would most likely die on route. My son the jokester told me that if he didn’t make it, Daniel was sent by medical helicopter to the Cleveland Clinic for the same operation

 

&gt;Both boys had successful Aortic Root replacements with a David’s valve sparing procedure performed by Dr. Eric Roselli. Unexpectedly, requiring the insertion of a filter in his veins.

 

&gt;After months of outpatient rehab, they had to accept that military service was no longer an option.  Their heart surgery made both of them realize that they wanted to pursue careers in the medical field, to help others as so many helped them throughout their ordeal.

 

&gt;However, we took him the ER on multiple occasions, where we were told that he was orthostatic (very low blood pressure, combined with a fast heart rate).  They advised us to increase his fluids and salt intake, and to have him wear compression socks.

 

&gt;In August 2012, fusiform aneurysms in each of his Internal Carotid arteries. He was taken back to Cleveland Clinic, where the neurologists confirmed the diagnosis but stated that they could not operate for several months, for bureaucratic reasons.  After being discharged from Cleveland Clinic, my wife and I decided not to rush home, but to stay in Cleveland near the hospital for a couple of days, to see how Daniel would do.  It was the right decision, when his vision went blurry. Since Cleveland Clinic still could not do the endoscopic stent procedure required to occlude the aneurysm

 

&gt;In September 2012, and found out that he had similar aneurysms in his internal carotid arteries. Since Daniel’s right side and both of Forrest’s sides were too wide to use the same stent, Dr. Woo told us we could apply for a “compassionate use” exception to use a non-FDA approved stent that would fit both him and his brother.  However, while awaiting word on the whether or not the compassionate use was approved, Daniel experienced excruciating pain.  Upon taking him to the ER, we learned that his AAD enlarged and further dissected to the point of requiring surgery.

 

&gt;Daniel’s surgery was on January 22, causing a stroke and he was rushed to the ER.  He is recovering from that well, but now has debilitating orthostatic hypotension. At the same time, post-surgery, Daniel slowly lost feeling in his legs and was diagnosed with a spinal cord infarction that has made him a paraplegic. He has complete paralysis from his belly button down and has no control of his bodily functions.

 

&gt;As if all of this weren’t enough, all the blood vessels in their body are vulnerable to ripping, shredding, and wreaking havoc on major organs.

I'm not sure how much information everyone is looking for so if you have more questions please don't hesitate to ask. I'll be your open book! 

On May 5, days earlier I had a doctor's appointment where I was told everything was fine. 2 weeks earlier I went in because I suspected my water broke but I was told it had not...at delivery it was found my water had indeed broken. Test's for preterm labor, I would later found out, aren't very conclusive. 

She was rushed to the NICU where we were allowed to see her for the first time a few hours later. She was too small and fragile to wear a diaper

The nurses just stood with us

There is a lot to this story so I will just flash forward to August. We had spent everyday since her birth in the NICU. Taking one step forward and two steps back. Dad worked and Mom learned every hospital term, I knew the signs were not good. Her doctor talked to us and told us we needed to think about surgery for a tracheostomy because ventilation was looking longer term. 

I turned to the internet and learned about a life of home ventilation. It seemed daunting but I had to make this all worth it for her. I had to try and get her out of that damn hospital alive. We went ahead with the trach surgery on August 5th. She died on the table but had a determined nurse that I'll never be more grateful for hand picking to go in there with her. She made them work for 10 minutes and Olivia came back. 

It was very touch and go after surgery. Two days spent sleeping next to her crib in a computer rolling chair. But she pulled through. And we finally got a change of scenery. We went upstairs to the PICU to learn how to be responsible for at home ventilation care. But we'd get more than we bargained for. She was scheduled for a last surgery on the 19th for a g-tube since she wouldn't be able to eat. At 7am on August 19th we were called and told surgery was canceled and we should come in. We walked in and her 30% oxygen requirement was at 100% (you and I require ~21.5%). 

Something was very wrong but we got a lot of ""we don't know"" and ""we'll run more tests."" On August 20th our worst fears were confirmed. She had a colonization of MRSA in her lungs and tested positive for KCP (Klebsiella pneumoniae). KCP is considered an instant killer

Unfortunately the bacteria was ravaging her body. She was bloated, things could end peacefully that way. On September 19 she had the best day yet. Her sats were great and we all didn't want to rock the boat so we skipped our nightly 12am bath and headed home for a nights rest. 

At 4am we received a call. Olivia's sats had plummeted and they weren't coming back up. We didn't speak until we got on the elevator. Emery, not matter what happened. When we arrived her room was packed. Only the nurses looked familiar. Her sats were awful. Her blood pressure was barely registering. We walked out of the room to talk about what we needed to do. Neither of us could say it so we walked back in. 

I asked to hold her, and I. 


The March of Dimes is a charity which hosts the March for Babies every year. The March of Dimes funds research into pre-term birth and infant mortality. They have also provided us a way to help others for Olivia. I don't come asking for much

My son is turning 10 next Monday and, gas is insane and I go through a lot for therapy/specialist appointments, etc) these past twoish years, we just do not have the money for gifts or much of a celebration. He receives almost nothing from family for Xmas/birthdays. We stopped having parties as no child has ever shown up for a birthday party of his (heartbreaking).  He will really enjoy receiving a bunch of birthday wishes from all over and it will make his birthday extra special even if we cannot afford much! 

Jamie is my little trooper. He is autistic and has many syndromes and deficits that sometimes go along with being on the spectrum (motor skills deficits, executive function deficits, social skills deficits, generalized anxiety disorder, speech &amp; language deficits, Sensory Processing Disorder, etc, which he has rarely ever complained about!

He's dealt with a lot of consistent bullying since kindergarten. We finally had the board of ed agree to a school transfer, sometimes up to 10 hours weekly depending on if either (or both) boys have a specialist visit).  It looks like our youngest may end up with the same or similar diagnoses. 

He's just an awesome kid. He loves TF2, Wolf's Rain and MLP (yes, he's a Bronie and is so embarrassed that he won't admit it to anyone).  He makes rage comics (he knows what Reddit is but doesn't browse it) and builds awesome Halo Mega Bloks toymations.  He loves to watch terrible scary B movies with me.  He also loves Skrillex and could gem mine for hours on end.  He says he will have no problem becoming a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company (apparently, dentists don't make enough).  He's a great big brother, even when the baby is annoying him (he says his brother is the best thing that has happened in his life).  He's the type of person who would take the gift bags we made for his birthday party to the kids at school/therapy/social skills play group/therapeutic horseback riding group even though not a single one of them showed up to his birthday party...

He has come so far. Back when he was diagnosed, run without falling, write his name legibly (writing is still painful and tiring so he uses the school's laptop much of the time), zip, snap, button, etc. Now he's reading at a 6th grade level (he's in 4th), is trying hard to be able to tie his shoes (motor skills/executive function deficits make it extremely hard for him) and as soon as we can afford to get him a bike

1339739110.0,v30sx,My upcoming wedding is turning into a disaster and I need help.,poloxamer,30,5,23,"Hello

A little about myself

I have been dating my fiancee for six years now and, so we are having to foot the bill for our own wedding. We have tried to keep it small, yet include as many of our friends and family as we possibly can. We started with a list of around ninety people, but we managed to whittle it down to about 55. We planned out a budget and a way to save some money and then it's like everything turned against us.

First up was the alternator going out on our car. We drive a Volkswagen Jetta and, we were set back over $600.

We both work full time at Wal-Mart, but we figured we could tighten our belts and sacrifice comforts here and there so that we could have a good wedding day in October.

Well, so we had to take him to the vet today. Between the x-rays to make sure he doesn't have pneumonia, the cost of the visit itself, and the medication, that set us back another unexpected $200.

Well, she made a deal to stick to a payment plan where she'd pay them back a little each month to avoid having her license suspended/revoked and she has been sticking to it moth after month. Earlier this year, she and I got rid of the car that had been in the wreck and traded it in for a better one. The car company said that we both had to have insurance, so I added her to my policy. Today I got a letter in the mail informing me that my policy was being cancelled because, apparently, they went ahead and revoked her license anyway. She called the department of transportation and, between the court costs, and reinstatement fees

Needless to say

So far, and we have reserved a pastor for the occasion. We have yet to buy our rings and there is no telling how we're going to rent me a tuxedo or feed the few guests we can afford to invite.

My dog Riddle is in trouble. Not quite a week ago, but... each surgery is roughly $3,800. Her right knee was only a partial tear, so we were able to save up over a while without her being in too much pain, but this one is a full tear. She's currently wearing a harness most of the time so we can help her get up and down, go down the stairs, and get around easier. We are saving up to get the surgery

Of course

Here is a Imgur gallery: http://imgur.com/a/S3BcB#0

Here is a video of Riddle in action before she was injured: http://youtu.be/WpLZFyqR9qE

I know that this isn't a cause equal in size and global importance to some Reddit has championed in the past, to exercising and training regularly, to spending a fortune on vet bills as it seems we're destined to do with poor Riddle. 

I don't like asking for donations, and that's tearing us apart. Any donation you could help us out with would be amazing, even just an upvote to gain more visibility.

If we raise five dollars I will consider this a success

I am not expecting that this will be huge

I have family and friends here, but I've run into quite a few problems with life, and as a result, I'm financially backwards. I don't see an immediate end to my problems, but I'm looking to keep my head up.

Without going into a sob story, however I've run into a wall with getting the situation fixed. Because I've used my credit card to pay the bill in the past, since they tried billing it again and no funds were available, they're not accepting anything but cash-payments from me at this point. To boot, we were on a payment plan, and I've missed the last payment by 10 days. I'm rather shocked actually with how this has worked out.

I've contacted our local welfare office, we just don't qualify. I'm stunned, because I've been a  hard-working taxpayer my entire life, have kicked into the system every which way possible, and I always give my change to the bell-ringer's for the Salvation Army.

I'm not sure who I pissed off

Any points in the right direction would help. I've finished applying for small jobs at odesk, and haven't had any bites yet - but there's hope! :)

Thanks for listening reddit!

**UPDATE**
Thanks to those for the comments and suggestions, it's Friday afternoon, and I'm already past freaked-out. At this point, I don't even know if I can get the heating company out here anymore. If anyone has any further ideas, I'm definitely game. Finally, I'm willing to do A TON of work to make this happen. Literally. Anything.

**UPDATE 2**
A very kind redditor has just sent, PhoenixMan83. We're now down to $135 or so left. I guess, by his suggestion as well, it doesn't hurt to put the paypal out here at this point either, but I feel rather ""grungy"" about this. [Redacted] is my paypal address. Thank you again. :)

That said, I guess. So if I anyone has ANYTHING I can do, I'm definitely game for it.

We finally got Bear home, sucking on his favorite blanket, and purring like the big monster he is. He slept through the night ok, but things changed this morning. He started throwing up again, this time much more violently. He couldn't even keep his stomach medicine down, and began vomiting a bloody foam. We immediately rushed him to the emergency vet as quickly as we could in the middle of a raging blizzard. 

After a very painful examination, the vet has determined that the foreign body is obstructing his small intestine. Bear needs surgery within the next 24 hours. He is currently in stable condition, but is obviously in distress and deteriorating. We were given two options, perform the operation or euthanize him before he suffers too much. 

The thing is


We have managed to work out a deal with the vet, I will not give up on him.

So Reddit, who would rather remain nameless, has been overwhelming. I want to thank you all for your kind words and advice as well, it definitely helped me get through the day.

I know some of you were wanting proof, but unsure how to help. I have spoken with the vet's office and they confirmed that they are able to accept donations over the phone, all you have to do is mention the patient name ""Bear"". Their phone number is 403.770.1340. Feel free to ask them any questions you may have, or just tell them how freaking awesome they are.

I'm off to the vet to say goodbye to Bear and see him into surgery. I'll be gone for a bit but I promise I will update you guys once I get the call saying how things went. With some amazing care and a little bit of luck my baby will be home tomorrow night. Thanks again reddit

By some coincidence, and his mother was nowhere to be found. 

[Over time](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2012/06/cemetery-dogs-oscars-updates.html)

My girlfriend Charlene and I researched a long, and we actually decided naming our puppy Oscar before changing our minds about buying a dog.

And it just happened that we saw from Hope Dog Rescue that Oscar needed a foster home. We decided to visit their adoption drive

Being a mongrel living in a cemetery

He is scared of strangers touching him, and our family. 

[This is a short video of Oscar in happier days!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh5Av6K_ZqI) The main cameraman(woman?) is Charlene

We brought Oscar to the vet last Sunday 24th of March, we realised something was terribly wrong. The medication causes increased thirst and urination. I had to bring him to pee four times a day (Oscar is outdoor trained). But on Saturday 2nd of March, after his morning walk, we noticed that Oscar did not drink any water from his bowl. [He also refused to eat his meal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_A0to4Yzc). His poo/diarrhea  was really yellow, soft, and mucuous-y, and he did not pee even a third of what he usually had. His pee was also extremely yellow. We called the vet out of concern

He was limp and we had to lift him up. Once he stood, and once the vet saw Oscar's condition, she immediately brought him in and ran some checks. 

She told us to leave him at the clinic overnight

But on Monday, and 2300 instead of 200 normal range). Oscar began to show signs of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).

The vet advised for a plasma transplant to stop this. After a quick discussion with the volunteers

On the morning of 5th March 2013, and he brought Oscar and me on the facility. After that, another volunteer drove me back to the hospital. The vet also said that Oscar's platelet count had plummeted, from 100k to only 11k overnight. She said a blood transfusion was necessary to give Oscar the platelets needed to fight whatever was going on in his body. We gave our consent, and the volunteers at Hope really shined and got a blood donor in a matter of hours.

His blood donor was a fellow rescue dog named Rudolph

I am going to be honest here: I have graduated last year, on the vets' advice).

I have been living within my means, we love him. We were just a couple who adopted a cheerful dog, and we are totally unprepared financially and mentally for this sudden collapse. 

The volunteers at Hope Dog Rescue have been an excellent support network, and Oscar collapsing so suddenly is sad, heart-wrenching and an occurrence that NONE of us, not me, not Charlene, not the rescuers at Hope, not even Oscar himself expected. I am lost and unprepared for this. 

Reddit

I am typing here really quickly on a laptop before I travel down to the place where Oscar is being hospitalized. Rudolph

I am appealing from the bottom of my heart. I've been here on reddit

If you stay in Singapore

If you are staying overseas, but I do not have a website to put it on. Any help or advice is appreciated. Again, any amount is greatly appreciated. 

I will provide proof

Thank you.

EDIT 1:20PM GST Oscar's platelet has gone even lower. From 11k the night before

The plan is for Oscar to get back on solid food

So I come to r/assistance asking not for money. The assistance I'm looking for is simply in spreading the word about organ donation. Far too many loved ones are lost because of a tragic shortage of awareness in North America. In Matt's native Ontario, and you can find the links below. As another friend said before he passed away, and subsequently donated many of his organs, ""it's simple, if you don't need it, you give it."" 

So register as an organ donor, should something unfortunate happen to you, that you may be able to provide up to eight(!) people with countless additional years with their loved ones. It's the greatest gift you can give, and you won't even have to pick up the tab!

TL;dr vol repo'd car (not realizing we'd be moving halfway across the country unexpectedly a week later) we can reclaim for a very reasonable amount.  First payment made.  Second payment will be made Friday.  Have plane ticket to get car booked with points.

We made the first payment, which we have paid but takes the gas and toll money to get the car back here.

I've confirmed that we can get temp tags to get it back here.  I've confirmed that we'll get the car back once the payment is made.  I've also confirmed we have nothing in the bank that will allow us to drive the car home.  My estimate for gas and tolls is $250.00.  Paypal should work (cutting it close time-wise to deposit into checking, that sort of thing) I could avoid tolls. It would add several hours to the trip but it COULD be done.

Latest pay stub is at http://imgur.com/c8aTG.jpg and I can and will pay back any amount.  We've received a paper phone bill

If I don't get the car on 12/26, overtime shifts would not be overtime anymore (&lt; 40 hrs) and I'm a temp so I can't exactly just take a day off even with a good reason.

To sweeten the deal, I'll be headed westbound) I'd be happy to give a ride.

I'm even more willing to prove legitimacy

Please?  I know $250.00 is quite a bit of money

We've gone to clinics and the ER instead of coming here for money for medical treatment (TMJ

TL;dr - can pay to redeem car.  cannot pay for gas to get it back here. (NY-IN).  Gas cards or donations of $250.00 would solve the problem

TL;dr #2 - I promised my wife I'd take care of her when we got married and I've not done the best job of that.  Headed in the right direction, and get some health insurance with it.  The better job leading to insurance is becoming more crucial as time goes on.  I'm borrowing a car to get across town to work now, but I'm severely putting family in a bind by doing so and my job options are very limited based on the schedule I need to be on with the borrowed car.

Sorry for the wall of text.  

I'll even gladly share a PDF of my Southwest itinerary for getting to NY to get the car

I've been selling plasma, but it's something.  It won't come up with the money we need for gas that quickly, though, for sure.

The lawyer who did my adoption said my parents are dead. He said my sisters were adopted by a baptist family and my brother was taken in by family.

*Update*

I just got off the phone with my mother (the one who adopted me) and she says that my birth mother was 16 when she gave birth to me. She was a wild child according to the people who spoke with my mom and may have used drugs or alcohol. Apparently we all have different fathers and there was a delay in my adoption while they tracked down my particular father. 

Apparently we'd all been abandoned by her and were living with our grandfather who surrendered us when our grandmother had a stroke and he could no longer take care of us.

To give you a better picture, I made enough to get by and be comfortable. Then the housing boom stopped, and the recession hit. I managed to eke out a living on unemployment, and I quickly ate through my savings. I moved to a cheaper place after selling all the furniture and electronics I could. I reduced what I own down to what can fit in a few boxes and my computer, all of which I was able to fit in the back of a car and move in with friends. After I moved, my car decided to turn into a piece of immobile metal, which I sold for scrap to pay for rent. After a few months of not paying insurance on a non-existent vehicle, and there was going to be a fee to get it reinstated.

Since then I've tried making stuff to sell on ebay, and some places several times. At a local bagel shop, they pulled me aside and told me to stop coming in every week, because they had a stack of applications the size of a phone book from potential employees. I would go to college, however, getting there and back is possibly the largest hurdle.

My bank account was closed due to insufficient funds months ago, because the most someone can steal is less than a quarter.

I don't know what to do, and they live too far away to do anything.

My good friend Katie and her family are expecting their rainbow baby come early July.

**[Late Child Trigger:]** *If you don't know what a ""rainbow baby"" is- it's a term given to a baby that has come after a previous child has been lost- like a miscarriage

Now

They aren't rolling in the dough, as she's 9 months pregnant and won't be for a few months after baby), I've come here- where miracles are known to happen and people here are as good as they come. I'm not trying to give you a sob story, it's just a sad story. But- this baby will be a new beginning for them.

With that said

She's not a reddit user

**A little about Katie and her family:**

Katie is sort of a ""crunchy"" mom. She loves to babywear, she's a breastfeeding champ and an all around awesome Mom. They have twin boys who are turning 5 soon. H &amp; J. Her husband Taylor is a great cook. They're both geeky, awesome people. They like Dr. Who, Taylor likes WoW and the twins love Power Rangers. Their late son Rowan was the prettiest baby with his big blue eyes and bright blond hair. His death was a surprise- no one saw it coming. He was sick the night before and passed away the next morning while they were getting ready for the doctor visit. It was more than traumatic for the whole family. He was a sweet baby and they all miss him terribly. They never found out what happened to him, but doctors chalked it up to cardiac arrest.
