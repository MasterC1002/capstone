1. If you plan on skipping class because you are ""sick"" you probably shouldn't write a status update involving how you have a hangover. We don't count hangovers as being sick. When you have class the next day we count them as stupid. Same goes for incriminating pics. Also

2. If you want to skip class

3. If you are having trouble in class, it's a part of my job description. Keep me company and ask me questions. It is usually good for your grade. If your prof/TA won't do this, talk to their boss. 

4. It takes me MUCH longer to grade F papers than A papers. If you're failing because you aren't trying, I WILL get pissed off if I can tell I spent more time grading your paper than you took to write it. 

5. Over half of freshmen flunk out. You will find yourself up a creek if you have to pay back loans and you have no degree. You will be eligible for the same jobs you had in high school but now have a considerable monthly payment. You are literally worse off than if you just stayed at the burger joint. If you aren't sure you want to do college

6. If something major and detrimental happens in your life, let you make up an assignment, etc... I will bend my own rules for you. I'm allowed. They're my rules. I bend them for students who need it.

7. Listen to advice from people who know what they are talking about. If you have a 2.5 GPA and are pre-med

8. Make use of your campus facilities. Your tuition money goes to pay for things like tutoring centers, concerts, and cultural centers. You don't have to use all of them, but use some of them. You paid for it, and you may find them helpful or fun. 

9. Don't talk about your professors to other students. Every single semester I get a very loyal student who rats out a classmate for talking about me. Loyal students who like professors get REALLY upset when they hear trash talk. I won't grade you harder

10. As a grad student I took out $11K in student loans when interest rates were really low. My monthly payment was $85. Many of you will take out $40-200K for your bachelors education. Your payments every month will be higher than what you spend on your car, unless it will save you a lot of money (you almost always lose classes you took when transferring). Get tutoring if you need it. If you advisor sucks, get another one. Know the course catalog for your major so you aren't relying on someone else to tell you what to take. Pay for as much of your tuition upfront as you can.

---

I dropped out of Stanford two years ago

Living the dream, and make a million dollars. And now here I am (with two out of the three so far).

Except nothing went the way it was supposed to. If it had, pretty low on the totem pole, about to start my second year as a Combat Correspondent. I didn't drop out of Stanford to go do the start-up thing; I dropped out because I was absolutely miserable. I didn't leave to take some internship at Google or rub elbows with VCs; I left to do whatever felt as distant as possible from college and the Silicon Valley. But for some reason, while half my Stanford classmates wanted to be entrepreneurs, I'm the one who ended up starting a business.

This is the fifth time I've started this letter over from the beginning. I'm at a McDonald's in the Philadelphia Airport on a layover from my new home in DC to SFO. I've been invited out to the Bay Area for a week by another small business and they're conveniently located right across Sand Hill Road from the Stanford Mall. I know so many other people who felt depressed, and now seems like a good time to tell it. But somehow it's hard to say ""I'm really, really happy and this is how it happened, and this is how you can do it too"" when all my advice boils down to ""be yourself"". ""Be yourself"" sounds profound when you hear it from a forty-something with years of experience behind them; i think it sounds stupid coming from a 23-year-old white boy who works by himself in a basement.

But I'm happy with my life. Really, beachfront houses, all kinds of skills and talents and the world at their feet. I met almost none who could honestly say they were happy.

The brand Stanford builds for itself is that you can expect Stanford to accomplish anything, and there'd be awesome drunk 4 AM conversations in the dorm hallways about the physics and ethics of Batman. I expected to learn so much in class because ""class"" would finally mean more than lectures and reading texts and writing papers.

It turned out Stanford students are humans too, and for this kind of person Stanford is easily the best of all possible environments. I'm not one of those people. I always thought that the A-average I'd carried from kindergarten through my junior year at Stanford meant I learned really well in a classroom, but after taking a full course load every quarter and not being able to remember anything after a final exam, I realized that actually I'd just gotten really good at taking tests.

Protip Number One when you're having a slump in college is to branch out and try different activities. I joined Fleet Street, and Dance Marathon, went to Cape Town, took Improv and ballroom dance and Design and Spanish and lots of Urban Studies, saw a counselor at Vaden, wrote for the Daily, went steam tunneling, had an awesome bombshell girlfriend

So I left. That was hard. It took two-and-a-half years and a whole lot of weekends spent alone in my dorm room watching Failblog, at the cost of some other kid somewhere getting a rejection letter, and you can't even appreciate it? What an ungrateful brat.

The reality is that college isn't right for everyone. Logically you know that nothing's right for everyone

So I switched my expectations over to the Marines. Classroom schooling hadn't been the answer to everything but maybe the opposite

Turns out Marines are humans too, and put on permanent suicide watch for three months while I waited to get discharged for being psychiatrically unfit -- officially an ""Erroneous Enlistment"" which is the military's way of saying they screwed up by not seeing the warning signs and letting me join up in the first place.

There are two nice things about feeling like you've hit bottom. First

Until that point I'd been expecting other things -- jobs, people -- to be the key to happiness. It meant not only a lot of putting my eggs in one basket but also a lot of trying to change myself to match what I thought was expected of me. If this wasn't achieving the desired outcome then logically the next step would be trying to not expect anything from anyone else, nor let anyone expect anything of me.

That meant that instead of going back to finish up a West Coast Ivy education I stayed at home in Cincinnati and looked at table-waiting jobs, DC, I ended up redesigning half their HR systems and exponentially increasing organization-wide efficiency because it was FUN, even though it was pretty clearly outside my authority because I was brought on as a recruitment intern. When I came up with a cool little invention and was advised to get investors and try to pass myself off as a professional established business, I instead made it abundantly clear that my ""business"" was just a young friendly guy in a basement learning as he went.

And now here I am, the more the world seems to reward me. 

What a neat trick! You grow up in a society of how-to books and ""ten steps to becoming an entrepreneur"" and it turns out all you have to do to be who you want to be is to be who you are. I don't think an entrepreneur is a person who comes up with great ideas; I think an entrepreneur is a person who lets themselves be so possessed by an idea that they'll naturally end up making it great without even meaning to. The idea doesn't have to be a product or a business; a stay-at-home mom who blogs honestly and openly about raising kids because she loves it is as much an entrepreneur as someone who invents a new computer. Entrepreneurship isn't a measure of accomplishments; it's a measure of self-commitment.

If you're happy at Stanford, make it a deliberate decision -- you're choosing to stay or you're choosing to leave. You're no longer just following the rules in the expectation that some day they'll start granting you freedom. I think Stanford's quietly on the same page with me here judging by how easy they make it to take time off; you can defer your admission or take off up to two years as an undergrad and come back pretty much whenever you want with no sort of penalty.

These aren't mean posts they are simply posts meant to help Freshmen not do something that clearly labels them a freshmen. So I will start off

Dear Freshmen
Please for the love of all things do not bring your whole room to college. I know Walmart has that wonderful list of about 45 items EVERY college kid needs to have. Its a trap!!!! I promise. Realize that you will probably wear the same pants with a different T-shirt about three days a week. You don't need a million clothes. All 45 of your teddy bears doesn't need to come either. Bring the essentials because many colleges and organizations will give you free stuff at the beginning of the year. Call a friend who goes to the school or just ask any college kid. They probably ocerpacked their freshmen year and ended up not using or wearing half the stuff.
Sincerely 
An upper classmen

P.s. good luck!


Edit: I will start adding more as I go and number them as well as the suggestions of others. 

Edit: have to go take photos of a soccer game. I'll be back soon

Not good. Second year (second semester) got my life into gear

So
-&gt; It doesn't matter who is paying your tuition. GO. TO. CLASS!
You can literally sit there on Reddit everyday and do 70% better in that class than you would by not going. This way, they still pay attention to whose there. Unless you're class is 150+ students, they will notice you if you've never been there before. PLUS they will be more willing to help you out if they know you at least show up to every class. 3. Stress. Even if you go and do nothing, you will feel better. If you just keep skipping class, you're stress will skyrocket, even subconsciously, especially closer to exams/midterms. 

-&gt;Talk to your professors on the first day of class and introduce yourself. Let yourself become on of the first faces they can recognize this term. This will (for most of them) give you a great first impression and they will be A LOT more willing to help you out on a 1on1 basis after this.

-&gt;The friends you make on your first day/week/month/term may not be your long term friends. I've seen people meet during ""Frosh Week"" and continue being BFF's from then on out. Then, it took me until the end of my first year/beginning of second to meet my friends who are my best friends/roommates today.

-&gt;If you can get a single room, its not worth it. Even if you don't end up with a horrific roommate, you're room should be somewhere you can retreat to, whether its just to mellow out, be with a girl or just study. Let somebody else's room be the ""host"".
P.S. Quick note on thinking about roommates. You don't REALLY know somebody

-&gt;Video games are AWESOME!.....in moderation. Trust me, but its not worth the long run (plus its a lot more money). It's hard, but just DO YOUR BEST to try and moderate your gaming. 

-&gt;Studying. You really don't have to sit down, study right after class. This way, the stuff is still fresh in your head AND if you do this right after class, every day, you will only need to spend 1-2 hours (on average) a day. As opposed to freaking out and trying to spend 5 days of 7-8 hours of studying before a midterm/exam. Doesn't work. Wouldn't you rather be able to just chill those few days leading up to your test?

-&gt; PLANNING! Make a study plan and stick to it. Go out and buy one of those giant dry-erase calendars that you can stick to your wall. Fill in important dates such as due-dates, fill in a day schedule. Your classes and study times. I cannot stress this enough. It is much more worthwhile to study a little bit every day then wait until its too late. This way, it will be staring at you every time that you're in your room. 

-&gt;Budget your spending. Try and manage how much you spend each week/month/etc. Its amazing how much stuff just randomly ""comes up"". You may need a new book that you didn't know about

-&gt;Be yourself. As corny as that actually sounds, you'll find the group of friends for you. If you try to be fake, it can only end badly. You won't feel like you really fit in and sooner or later, your friends notice too. Trust me.

-&gt;Lastly, was after 1.5 years of eating whatever the hell I wanted then realizing why I gained more weight and felt like crap. If your campus has a gym, use it. Even if it is only for 1-2 hours a week and you're just getting some cardio in, its worth it. You will look/feel better and in turn, will do better overall! This last semester, I ate healthy and hit the gym for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week. Lost 60lbs and am sitting at 210lbs and feeling amazing. 

I'm sure there is a ton of stuff I'm forgetting and if this gets anybody's attention

TL;DR
Go to class.
Meet your professors. Your first friends may not always be your friends. Should try for a single room. Manage your social life and video game playing. Study (derp). Plan everything. Watch your spending. Watch your health.

Be yourself.

1 . Do stuff. Don't be the guy who sits in your dorm and watches netflix and gets on reddit all day (sorry guys...)

2 . Find a girl/boy. I know this sounds cliche

3 . If you still arent convinced to do something (a sport, and your  choices come down to either: be poor, beg from your parents, or get a job. Just think of it as practice for when you graduate.

4 . Get a posse. This may sound like a bad thing, i just mean you need a close group of friends who you can be real with in college. The truth is, it is stressful, even to a guy like myself who is a ""no stress"" guy...you need some friends that you can chill with at the end of the day.

5 . Remember what you are there for. It seems like anytime i see a ""Things you should know about college"" post they touch on this, and drunk girls EVERYWHERE, but remember, you are there to get a degree. That should be first on the list.

6 . While we are on the subject

- Evernote: Make a notebook for each class and take notes

- Also use it to write down thoughts

- Don't be afraid to go analog. Handwritten notes are awesome and no one will make fun of you for going low tech. If anything they will give you major respect. We live in a world where writing things down in a word doc begins to lose its magic

I did what some of you suggested and went to her for an explanation. I emailed her and she didn't respond. I called her and she didn't answer. I went to her office during her office hours and she wasn't there. I did this for three days before finally saying fuck it I'm going to administrators. 

Shortly before our spring break

His response was that they have gotten a lot of negative feedback on this teacher over the past few years and that he couldn't say any more than that. He told me he would look into it and apologized.

**AFTER SPRING BREAK**

I walked to class and saw a note on the door. Said class would be held in so and so room for THIS DAY ONLY. I went to that class room and saw really old guy and same guy I talked to. Brief ""good afternoon"" yada yada how was spring break etc. Once everyone got in and about five minutes after class was suppose to start our teacher wasn't there yet.

He began talking and let us know that she was no longer with our school and that if she tries to contact us to ignore it and report it to them. That was monday. I was actually shaking with excitement.

Today however

Now we're in the process of trying to recover grades for everyone and sort out some kind of agreement on where to go from here.

3. Flawed Curriculum - It's funny how many times a student or teacher will point out technical

4. Three fourths of the teachers here are incredibly sub par. You can tell they are here for the paycheck and not to teach. My 2nd quarter I had a class with my chair of my program. He was burnt out

5. At 40k for your AA

6. Career Advisers points me to jobs requiring 2 years + experience that also require certifications.

7. Friday night classes to 10:45 PM followed by a Saturday morning class at 8:00 AM.

1.  Please, you probably just had a sympathetic/apathetic RA who didn't give a shit.   Trust me, we know when you're smoking weed.

2.  On that note, or any of that shit as 'study aids,' please keep in mind that even having one pill of that stuff can get you in big trouble with the police.  I have seen students recieve felony charges for that.  Do I agree with it?  Mostly not.  But it's a reality.  And if *you are stupid enough to smoke in the rooms and keep shit like prescription drugs that aren't yours, acid, mdma, x, or copious amount of liquor

3.  Easy solution to all of this?  Don't use or store any of your shit in the room.  Chances are

4.  Do not store liquor bottles in your window.  Fuck it

5.  Find out what your level of tolerance is for drinks, dude,"" because you were not writing it down.  So if it's 10 drinks in a night (not 10 drinks all at once, you idiot), make sure you don't hit 11.  Yes, it will make a difference.  Yes, you will avoid puking in random places, or ending up dead.  The latter condition is irreversible and students die every semester from drinking too much.

I've been fairly successful, college will kick your tail in more ways than one. I'm still a noob at a lot of stuff

**1)** The academics hit the ground running. The load varies by college, wtf? It's typical though. You'll be doing homework a lot. Get the big boy pants on and push through it.

**2)** Professors really don't give a shit... *unless you make them want to*. What I mean by that is, or even if you want clout in the department, that's how you do it. I'm not even kidding. I know for a fact I had a B+ in a class last semester, but me and my professor had chummed up and my final grade was an A- (there wasn't a curve, for all the skeptics). It won't work every time, but it's worth the effort.

**3)** Talk to the department in which you think you'll want to select a major and get information early on. Most departments, since it's a lib arts college, we have ""divisionals"" (some schools call them ""Gen Ed"" requirements) that you have to take to graduate. Some of the those divisionals could correspond to your major, and you could knock out two requirements with one credit. Doing that as often as possible could open the space for those minor classes or pre-med/pre-law classes. Come junior and senior year, you'll be thanking yourself.

**4)** Don't drink punch at parties. Seriously. That shit has everclear in it.



If you have any questions, I don't really care. College is an a truly wonderful experience, and it helps to do the little things well.

- Test Files. No matter who you are

- Type papers using Mac Dictation or another talk to text program. It literally cuts the time of writing a paper in half (at least) because you can literally have a conversation with your computer and instead of taking the time to think about what you want to type next

- Go to teachers office hours. Professors are much more likely to increase your grade if you go in and talk to them. Also

- Use RateMyProfessor to pick every teacher or professor you have. I cannot stress this enough because most general classes have at least one teacher who is a lot easier than the other. Relieves a lot of stress and increases your grade when you can find the teachers who grade easier

- Take the easy online class versions of your classes if you can. Not only do you not have to go to class but these classes are often much easier because all of the tests and quizzes are online and you can use the Internet during them. Also

I'm going to give you the best possible advice I can. And that's this: don't worry about it too much. I know you are disappointed, I'm a double Bruin, and I'm back here for grad school. It's great. That being said, after it's all said and done, and after giving it lots and lots of thought, I realize now that I probably would have been happy anywhere, or at any similar-type school. And in all honesty, it doesn't matter where you wen't to college--both for your profession and for your personal life. Indeed, I probably would have loved it and I would be ""repping"" those colors and t-shirts right now. Let me explain.


When you go to college, you aren't going to have the same friend groups or interests that you did in high school. More importantly, you are going have a ton of new experiences (whether it be in student clubs, in greek life, at parties, dating, going to sports games), you don't know who you are going to be or what you are going to want two years from now. The great thing is that virtually any college worth it's weight, can provide those experiences for you. They all have great people, you will find those experiences that you need to grow as a person and love college. Trust me.


Sure, it's going to be different. No school except Florida is going to have the (dumb) Gator chomp. But you are going to embrace those differences, and love it. Are there exceptions? Yea. Sure. There are probably some state schools that have no social scene or school pride. And maybe those shouldn't be on your radar. For example, I can't remember the last time someone was cheering for Cal-State Hayward (no offense). But by in large, it's easy to find a school that has all you want it to offer (and indeed, as I have already pointed out, you probably don't know what you even really want yet).


Let me tell you my own story. Honestly, I applied to transfer to Pomona College after the first year (I had visited friends there and liked it a lot). But then I joined a couple organizations that I liked (an a cappella group and a summer camp). And then I joined a fraternity (which I NEVER saw myself doing before). And they were awesome. And suddenly I was having a great time. And what I realized was that the reason I had such a bad first year was NOT that UCLA wasn't the school for me. It was because I, personally, had not been as open minded or outgoing as I should have been. And what I came to realize is that happiness in school, at ANY school (and maybe in life), is not dependent on certain facts like school-ranking, weather, but you won't enjoy it unless you take advantage of it (aka
Do I love my a cappella group, I know, deep down, that I probably would have had similar and equally exciting experiences at Texas, Berkeley, or Ohio State. Do I love UCLA and rep it constantly? Absolutely. But my professional, personal, you're gonna be ok,,

Turns out that I was dropped from college, which I did, several months ago back in my last semester. 

I tripled checked it and signed in for classes, balanced things out so I could live decently until december, and thought nothing of it. 

Now I can not reenter my classes and was not contacted either by email or phone when I was dropped (the classes filled up when I was dropped). Now I can not go to college because of this! My insurance drops, I'm in deep crap. To top it off I have to tell my parents which they will probably chew me out and throw me out the door because that is how they are, college or you live on your own.

Thanks college for not telling me I was dropped before hand =/

I don't know what to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT:
Time for a update I guess of this mess. 

I dressed nicely and made a face to face ""advising session"" with the dean of the school to get this fixed but they basically said ""sorry for your luck

They stated that they tried to contact me via phone and email (which they did not) and I told them they did not but they said they can not do anything and basically said it was my fault for not checking the website more often (not in those words though).

The problem is there are no immediate ""let ins"" for dorm rooms in less then a week situations like this and all of my classes that I had got filled up when I was ""let go"".

The school starts the 19th and I can not enter

Searching around the internet I found a two year technical school in another town but about the same distance of my original school and contacted them and set up a interview Friday. I told them my situation and they were able to get me in to some classes, just not at the one I went to my first year.

All my credits transferred and to make it even better the tech school is cheaper.. only thing is I have to drive there every day. The school year for them starts the 26th.

So today I learned in a big college campus

TLDR; Be careful out there college students

There is a guy who's mom is auditing all the classes he is taking.  I know people in two of his classes.  When they walked in, she ordered him to shake hands with the professor, and introduced herself as his mom.  According to one witness, she then told the professor to let her know if he has any trouble.  People I know then sought out this guy (he lives on campus) and gave him a hug.  Some freshman and upperclassmen have taken him in.  Apparently this is the only way she would let him go to college.

I have been going to a very good high school (public school on the East Coast located in a predominantly asian/white community with VERY HIGH standards in terms of GPA, etc.) in the US for four years. The school was ranked in the top ten until like last year when we dropped down to like 60-something because of a low student-faculty ratio :/. In terms of my own achievements, I managed to pull off quite a high gpa (we go on a 100 scale, so it ended up being about a 97) with a good amount of APs, honors classes etc, an okay SAT for the area (2100s), and a good amount of extracurriculars with lots of leadership and dedication (hundreds of hours and such) and outreach etc. (Side note: this school is in no way easy, not that I didn’t enjoy the activites). I wasn’t Ivy material

So last year, Duke, etc.) - not bad for a public school) - so that was last year, good year, lots of acceptances and lots of people happy...

Now moving on to this year, 2 to Harvard, 1 to Duke, etc... So that was fine and dandy, chances for regular kids looked pretty great. Then, because luck just loves our school, regular decision rolled around (these past few days/ weeks) and basically NO ONE got in anywhere, no one to Hopkins

Now some kids realized that this may possibly be due to the fact that our guidance department sent out our midyear reports incorrectly - they sent them out as optional forms, ignored them because they were in the wrong format... YAY! (These reports are actually like really important when looking for that one thing that sets student A apart from student B)

So my question is: was it the students' deficiencies do you think, if it was the school and not us that messed up, is there anything that could come of this, or are we all still screwed?

I know that this entire rant may sound super pretentious, to have NONE of us accepted almost everywhere, is just so insulting and disheartening. Please don’t take this as me crying, just wondering how something like this is possible. :/ I would understand a lower number of acceptances to many great schools, but 0 overall during regular, that is actually impossible in one year, especially looking at our past history. I just don’t know anymore... Thoughts are super welcome

Always visit a campus in person.

When you do

Talk to more than one person. 

Be sure to ask the pros and cons of the school. Students are especially helpful with this. 

Some questions to ask: 

*How is the administration? Particularly the offices you will likely be dealing with most- the Bursar and the Registrar. Are they nice? Helpful? Rude? 

*Who are the easy/lenient professors for core classes? I am sure you are an exemplary student. I was in high school too. And guess what? I goofed off my entire freshman year (especially first semester). I ended up losing my academic scholarship and caused myself so much hassle and money that could have been avoided if one of two (or both) things had happened. The most obvious being, everyone does. And it’s ok to have fun and slack off a bit. However, it’s a slippery slope to failure, so be careful. The second thing, is that my ‘ adviser’ suggested I take 16 credit hours (versus 12- the minimum to live on campus). As a student who knew nothing about the classes or teachers (because I never asked), I let her sign me up for whatever. What I didn’t know was that she just stuck me in the classes that were left over and had the fewest number of students in them. Thus, I ended up with some of the hardest teachers for 4 out of my 5 classes. Keep that in mind. 

Talk to the student workers on campus. Ask them how they like their job

Did you notice how I keep telling you to talk to students? This is because they are your most valuable tool for getting an accurate representation of any school. They don’t have to sell the school, and they have no reason to lie to you. Again, talk to multiple students because they are all different and will all have different perspectives that will be useful. 

Ok

Any loan that you receive is secretly lower than it says. The bank takes a percentage off the top

Learn how to cook at least some basic meals. If you have a meal plan

If you are broke to the point that you can’t afford food, the government says they have to toss any leftover food. However, oftentimes you can take it home with you. I suggest talking to your supervisor about it first though, because some can be sticklers (aka a boss from hell) and will accuse you of stealing. 

Most schools make you pay for laundry. Be sure to ask about that too (cost, you can save a little bit of cash by doing the following. These may seem like common sense things, but you would be amazed how many people don’t do them. 

Most items can be worn more than once before they have to be washed. This is especially true for pants. I suggest hanging them overnight somewhere before folding and putting them in their own pile away from the fresh laundry. 

*For the above tip

Buy plenty of socks; they tend to lose their mates quicker than you would think. When you buy socks

When you can no longer avoid doing laundry, I don’t wear much red. But every so often, I like to have these items clean. I don’t want to run a whole load for 5 items. My roommate, however, wears tons of reds and pinks. So I will run my stuff with hers. I wear a lot of black, she doesn’t. Same thing applies. 

Never pay for a dryer if you can get away with it. Hang up your clothes in front of a window (especially if it’s warm and sunny). If it’s cold and miserable outside, you should probably use the dryer otherwise they will smell musty. 

If you don’t have a good heating system (like my apartment), and you’re good to go. If you live in a dorm, I’m sorry. Invest in blankets. **EDIT:** Never do this with a gas oven! **EVER!** [Here is why] (http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/ota/section/2/release/15906) My roommate do this with an electric oven and have never had any problems. Thank you from *yawetag12* for pointing this out.

Talk to your teachers. Get to know them (especially the cool ones). There are a couple different reasons why. For one thing, graduate school, etc. They can help you network so it’s easier to get a job. And sometimes they will offer to take you to cool events. For example, my favorite art teacher has given me groceries she would have had to throw out (new diet), told me about a summer trip to Italy before it was officially posted so I could gather funds easier, given me endless amounts of constructive criticism for stuff she didn’t have to, and is even giving me a very nice wedding present (she is paying for our dancing lessons). And, you will know a pretty awesome person.

1) The school you go to and the major you choose is much less importent then many claim: What really matters is what you do while you are there. Nobody, but in the end they are not guaranteed a job, and their fields are moving fast, meaning if they fail to get a job immediately they may have trouble getting a job after a year passes.


2) Class is no optional: Nope it is not. Many college students go into their studies with the idea that missing a couple classes is fine


3) Your friends freshman year are not likely to be your friends senior year: Going in


4) High School Drama does not stay in high school: Related to #3, just 'cause. Try to keep yourself away from it, and distance yourself from people who revel in this drama.

7) You will have some classes that, there will be those classes that just plain suck. It doesn't matter your major, concentration, etc, there will be at least one (and often a couple) classes that are mostly busywork that you will have to take.

My roommates/suite-mates were checking out of their room while I was taking my last two finals back-to-back and were cleaning out alcohol they had been hiding all year. The RA comes in to check them out and appropriately writes them all up for possession alcohol in a dry dorm. Because I was living in the room

My evidence was the fact that the school had no proof my roommates possessed this alcohol all semester (as it was check-out time and they were cleaning out their things)

My school's conduct board used their ""summer process"" and did not give me a pre-hearing (as is normally standard)

My sanctions included pending termination of residency (housing expulsion if I commit and wrong-doings within the next academic year), and a conduct letter sent to my mother. This letter is confusing because in Admissions I was taught that a student's conduct records were protected by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and although my mother does not have a waiver to know of my record, they already sent her the letter. Not to mention I was given two days to appeal all these sanctions but was notified the letter was already sent out to my mother! My school locally advertises students' conduct records being protected under FERPA but otherwise, this seems like a very bad lie.

I am not venting more or less because of the sanctions, my school possibly violated FERPA, and I am being treated like a criminal within the school I have given everything to these last two years.

TL;DR - Conduct Board prosecutes me based on circumstantial evidence while I have proof that I was not at the incident in question. My school possibly violated FERPA by sending my mother a letter concerning my conduct record despite no FERPA waiver and before I have a chance to appeal the sanctions.

As most of you are aware

I'm not here to console you

I'm approaching the end of my first semester at SUNY Geneseo, SUNY Geneseo, SUNY Binghamton, George Washington University, and University of Vermont (safety).

I ended up getting rejected from Cornell and Bing, I was pretty upset. Born and raised in Ithaca (where Cornell is), I always looked toward Cornell to be *the* college to go to; however, this was not the case.

I ended up at Geneseo, and most importantly, what I was genuinely interested in. I came in as a political science major, which I still enjoy, but learned I was very interested in labor history and policy through taking a 200-level history course, Work and Workers in America. At first, I was intimidated by how much I had to read (i.e. four books, and textbook reading for each lecture)

Upon registering for spring classes, to see if they had anything to offer. I called several schools within Cornell, looked through several curriculums, and concluded that Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) was where I needed to transfer to further pursue this interest.

I very recently contacted my Labor professor, in fact. No doubt my academic interest reflected well upon my grades, and I'm expecting at least a 3.5 GPA for my first semester.

The point is

She has been straight A so far through all pre-reqs and first year of nursing school. 

At the end of the last semester, but in this case there was none. She was spending hours upon hours retaking the same damn test and losing study time needed for the final. She decided it would be ok to collaborate with a friend since it was an open-book test. 

A classmate found out, and i think the decision will stand.

"" 1) A grade of an F be submitted for NAME for Nursing 218: Maternal Newborn Nursing Concepts
2) NAME be suspended from the nursing program for a period of one year. She should be allowed to re-enroll in Spring 2013.
3) NAME re-enroll in the Nursing program with Academic Santions imposed to include:
ineligible to apply for the Scholarship
ineligible to hold an office in the student nursing associaiton on campus
exclusion from participation in privileged academic activities (e.g. SHP Recognition Ceremony
Although this is perhaps not the outcome you had hoped for it is in keeping with prior Honor Council Decisions. Such behavior swill not be tolerated in teh SHP and student must take the Honor Code seriously in all aspects of academic classroom activities. You are training to enter a profession in which the public has placed a great deal of trust and you must embrace and uphold these values.""

You hae 5 days in which to provide written comments to the Dean of SHP before a final decision is made

I am devastated. I can only compare this to me drinking and driving and losing my ability to work and support my family. We killed ourselves for her to get her through this year

Last November I withdrew from college. I left with a good GPA

I didn't come to the decision lightly, grabbed the readmission papers and went on my way.

In January, you don't have to pay back any of the financial aid you received. The date in question that they reference is the date you last attended class. I attended class last on the 29th of October. The 60% mark was the 30th. My counselor never mentioned this fact, even after I specifically asked her the implications for my financial aid. (Yes, $5,000 is about 40% of my aid. I am an independent student who receives little-to-no assistance from either parent).

Now, at least that they'd be willing to give me. It makes things a little more complicated when nobody in my family knows I withdrew. I still live in the city that I go to school in, close to where my local family lives. Since November, I've done everything in my power to dodge concrete questions about my education. All they know is what I've told them: I'm really busy and the school is charging me money for something that is their fault. They also know that if I don't fix this, that I can't go back to school (true, since unless my balance is $0 they won't accept my readmission).

If I had the choice

There was a silver lining though: I had still be attending class while my withdrawal was still in limbo. They give you ten days to think about it before they process your withdrawal

No sell. I had to go higher up in the bureaucracy if I wanted to get my date of last attendance fixed. I started asking the Director of Undergraduate Advising at my school, I was held back by her secretary, who instead relayed the information her boss IM'ed her. I had started to become ""That Guy"", everytime I tell someone my name now, people seem to recognize who I am within the system.

Finally, scanned it, emailed it, hand-delivered the physical copy and sent her a confirmation email. No reply. To any of them.

At this point, the Director had not done what she had told me she would, and that my date of last attendance had not been altered. Finally though, I got a breath of fresh air. A man named Michael (who I know reads Reddit and if you're reading this, I want you to know how eternally grateful I am to you for being the first person to actually do something to help me) filed a ticket with the Registrar. I was given a phone number, and with in the next few days, I got in touch with a man who altered my date.

Then I checked my balance a few days later, no nothing. I went to the financial aid office again, only to find out that the billing office is putting me off. Another ticket was filed, and my contact information noted.

This morning I woke up to a call from a bill collector. I tried to explain to her the rules that are noted on their website, and used any and all missteps in my method to criticize me.

I've prepared for the worst at this point. I'm sending out my resume

The worst part about it is that if my counselor had said anything, which was after the 60% mark. I would have never had to deal with this. Hopefully my efforts can make this all go away but you never know with bureaucracy.

So I go to a school in China. And in these schools

Everyday I hear these local classmates saying, Northwestern, and NYU. 

So why do I make this post? What problem do I want to address? 

International students pay more in tuition. Universities are constantly running out of money or want money (*cough* NYU). These rich international students... do they somewhat have a higher chance of getting accepted because they are not qualified for financial aid AND they can afford the whole tuition and housing fees? Is it a problem that these students are filling up public universities such as the UCs?

And it's not only that. At my school, and UCs obsessed kids taking all these AP classes and having 3.5+ GPAs. Not to mention they spend thousands on SAT prep programs and tens of thousands on college counseling. Literally if they rack up thousands of dollars (in chinese rmb) they have these people telling them the specific GPA, SAT test scores, extracurriculars, and hours of community service they must do in order to get into their top choice. 

What disturbs me the most is that my school is one out of hundreds of schools like these. Is this a problem? Could this be a problem? Could this be affecting college acceptance rates? 

Tl;dr: Are well off international students a problem to the American college system? Could they be? 

Edit: Sure this could lean towards.. is there possibly more inequality and unfair prioritization.. but it just kind of disturbs me. Because while there are international students paying even more fees

Most of the jobs on campus require work study, and I believe the extra 10-15 hours I have a week contributes to that. I'm a fine arts major so I have a lot of extremely consuming projects which require 100% of my effort and time.

When I was admitted to college #1, done.

I came back home to work on the family farm after realizing that the degree program I'd moved hundreds of miles for was a ripoff

In October '10, and everything seemed just fine.  I kept checking in with them to find out the progress, as my online info wasn't updating.  They kept promising someone would get back to me.  I was applying for Spring '11, so by finals week of that fall, I had had enough.  I drove over an hour to the college's main campus, and camped out until someone would speak to me in detail.  After an hour and a half, I threatened to go speak to the provost

Come to find out, but she never expected that that kind of thing would ever be needed, so I had to put a lot of them together myself while working 60+ hours, 7 days a week.  I was told that because I had waited so late in the semester to provide the required forms, it was unlikely that I would be able to enroll in the spring.  This is despite never having been told they needed anything like this.  There was no way to search for it on their site (don't even get me started on that one) and no one answering the phones knew about these requirements, but I could have come up there at any time (M-TR, 9-4:30) to see a physical form.

I handed them a 3 ring binder

I didn't get in for that spring.

It took them a month and a half to review my documents.  I checked every day

I had to get a tetanus shot.  Mine was 1 year and 4 days out of due, I had a bad reaction to the shot, but I figure everything should be fine.  I'm officially admitted to the school.

Come time for registration, an hour in the other direction, and I need to have it back to them in order to register.  The school cannot fax it.  I drive over, pick it up, and break down in the school nurse's office.  20 years old, in front of 15 and 16 year olds.  I then drove the shot records back, where I ask to make a copy.  They take the original, and I'm told I can never have it back.  No copy.  Once they have it

I'm currently in the army and am getting out fairly soon. My plan right now is to attend college. I was a fairly smart kid in high school. I had a 3.75 GPA and got a 27 on my ACT. I could have got accepted to any number of schools but coming from an extremely poor family with 5 siblings I didn't want to incur a lot of debt or place a financial burden on my family. As my time in the army draws to an end I'm getting a little anxious about what to major in. Everyone always says that there's no jobs out there, so I was thinking environmental science. On the other hand I'm very drawn to mysteries and problem solving. I'd like to study astronomy, but I don't know very much about physics or know what kind of job I could get with that degree. I think my biggest interest, my life goal if you will, is social reform. Somehow I wish that I could change the values of our society away from consumerism and the worship of money. I feel like humanity is headed down a very dark path if we don't change our ways. Any suggestions to help point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.

So I study at a college in Germany that claims to be based on the American college system. Fact is, but the worst part is that even after studying for about a year here, I can pretty safely say that there is hardly anything that I learnt here. The instructors and professors are boring and grade you in a way that is simply weird. Unlike US colleges, the grades aren't adjusted based on the whole class's performance, and the professors can make an exam really tough (which they definitely do) and give the whole class crappy grades at the end of the year. Studying here has made me realize that I am just throwing 3 years of my life away. I loved to study, but I don't think I even want to do my Masters now. I just wish that society didn't expect of us to have these useless degrees and I could read a shitload of books on my own and figure out my life without having to deal with people and institutions who just play with your life. The worst part is this college was my safety college. I had awesome high school grades, essays, had a diverse student body (which is true, no good parties and you get tired of walking around the same small campus watching the same people everyday

EDIT 1: I didn't mention the name of my college before, I would never in a million years have come here. I can't believe how fucked up life can be. I worked SO hard in high school, always got As, was top of my class, excellent SATs, essays and ECs and I still ended in a shit hole. I've just stopped studying or giving a fuck about academics or anything related to it. It's all just luck, and in the full scheme of things I doubt hard work matters anymore. What is worse is that some professors just refuse to accept that they are wrong. One particular genius deducted marks because he didn't know that atoms and molecules don't necessarily have the same weight (other than noble gases etc). When I asked him to correct it, I just don't know why this world doesn't value creativity and concepts more than just learning stuff without understanding it. I've seen people who don't deserve shit

I was in my Calculus class  and some guy kept going back and forth outside of the class to keep talking on the phone. Then when my classmate got up for the 100th time
This is what he said: ""I cannot believe people are slaves over technology. Why do ""kids"" get attracted over some little device that can kill you or get your distracted from the big things like math"" -Everyone laughed-
""I think everyone should see a movie
""I don't get why kids would keep texting and calling all day, not consumers. I see all of you being consumers, don't you want to make something out of yourselves and create something and be proud of it?""
""I only make ten texts messages per year and I think that's too much
Then he continue on with the lecture...

All of those quotes, to teach him a lesson.
But The last few things hit me. I want to create something out of myself, change the world. I don't want to be a consumer,a follower, or as he said it ""slave to technology"".

I entered the semester with high expectations of myself after transferring from another school from which I had a bad experience, and crippled my day to day life and general happiness. Everyday was mentally exhausting. The stress of everything happening so quickly brought me to what I can safely say was the lowest point in my life, to which I never wish to return. 

Over time, I have grown tremendously as an individual. I am more experienced and prepared for the future, whatever it may bring. I feel as though I have been disillusioned to the hardships of life, and am seriously ready to take it on.

Its going really well and I am writing like a champ. I like to work this way, almost exactly as you see it minus some of the punctuation and capitalization and so on

Some context: I have generally given up on my appearances this week, the work is going really well I am just pounding it out, drinking a lot of Red Bull energy drink (their slogan: Red Bull gives you wings!)  When I take breaks I like to look out the window and watch people walk by down alumni walk. They don’t know anything about the fervor that is going on up in this FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.  

We have advisors assigned to us who help you with your thesis project and keep you on schedule. I actually do not curse my advisor but I have been hearing a lot of people doing so. I don’t think she knows how little I have slept because I try to keep up appearances (haha) around her so she doesn’t worry or know how I left so much of it to the last week. I had this conversation with her about how after I turn in my thesis

Then I just took the religious imagery thing and ran with it. It kinda works!  I probably just made myself look like a huge egotist with the whole “I am the god of….” “peons…” etc. Just playing around

*The Fall From Grace*
*Why One Does Not Write Their Thesis in the Religious Studies Lounge*
*****

Dawn breaks on the Day of Reckoning.

From the corner window in my Ivory Tower

The Fortress of Solitude. I look down on you

Passing peons - you don’t know tenacity.

I am the embodiment of Lack. The God of 

Type – Return – Indent – Type. 

Benevolent though I am

with disgusted gaze

to walk among you in the 

Garden of Earthly Delights. 

One Day you too will know. 

Appearances

Societal norm

Did you expect this trial-by-fire would leave

You entirely unscathed? 

I am not

so pure a scholar

by the original sin

Thus we repent

The blood of the spring Red Bull 

will be taken gulp by inglorious gulp.

Taken for our own in some hope 

that the advisor will pass us

over without Fail.

As if

on our face

we take the lords name in vain. 

The Lord Thesis

and the Advisor

he bears a similar distrust in the eternal.

Ironic that he who holds the whip

also feels the sting

worse than all. For

of the almighty (may that day come swift)

ready heretics that we are

The Bacchanal will quite surely 

soften our memory of toil. 

And Advisors

If at all. And so it is left –

Thesis and his Advisor

While the laity 

At the witching hour

pour out the sacrament 

Toast to their loneliness..

Am I really setting myself up for failure

Or... do I need to focus on a CS degree, hardware-based, troubleshooting &amp; setup over monotonous coding &amp; programming. If I'm wrong about any of my assessments of either of these careers, please tell me.

I began the return process on their website and opted to return both textbooks in the same package. By doing so I was provided a link to print a return invoice and a return label. The invoice listed both textbooks with a check box next to each title. I checked that both textbooks were in the package. The website and the return invoice both stated that once the package had been scanned at the USPS that the textbooks would be considered returned. So

This went on for nearly a month. I called customer service nearly a dozen times and I waited in the queue for 30 minutes or more each time! Eventually I wasn't even able to reach a customer representative but instead spoke with the company's ""answering service"". At this point I'm highly frustrated, I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. After filing my complaint with the Better Business Bureau I e-mailed the company to inform them that I had filed a complaint. Would you believe that the following day after filing the complaint and sending them an e-mail they miraculously find my other textbook and credit me back the late fee? Yep.

So here is my warning: do not rent from Bookrenter.com! If you decide to take a chance and use Bookrenter.com be smarter than I was and request a tracking number with the weight of the package listed. Let me finish by saying that I'm not against renting. Renting textbooks is a wonderful alternative to buying textbooks outright. Especially with the astronomical costs of textbooks. Just research the company that you are considering renting from. There are other issues that fellow students have had with this company. If you are interested here is a link to the reviews I found:

Anyway, you know. Anyway, once I got to the dorm, what I realized was that when my 4 suitemates are out, and partying, and the dorm is pretty empty (on Friday and sterday nights) there is not much to do. It just is boring. I could go to sleep, but every time I've done that I've gotten woken up by one of my suitemates or a friend, and I don't get much sleep anyway. 

This led to me going out more and more, it was better then sitting bored in my room all alone and twidling my thumbs. I also put in a request for a move before the break. Over the break that request came back rejected because they only grant requests when it is roommate issues (which mine isn't, I have nothing against my roommates). I've also realized that I don't want to keep this up. While going out and partying is fun, the smoking weed, drinking, other drugs, just isn't healthy and doesn't support me pursuing my major.  This is especially true as I am starting to actually focus on my major (advertising) this next semester, and ZI don't want that. I live around half an hour away from the school, noting that that was part of life and I would have to learn to deal with distractions.

1354590801.0,148omw,Dorming is officially ruined for me.,sammywhammy52,22,12,18,"I apologize in advance for the ranting...

So let me start with the background of the situation. I am a sophomore but this is my first semester at my new school because I transferred after last year. I know that a small percentage of people like their first year roommates, and overall nasty people you can think of. I was argued with, yelled at, and even threatened all because I wanted to be able to get enough sleep. I got my RA involved countless numbers of times, but all she would say was to ""respect each other"" and figure it out. I'm a level-headed and reasonable person, but telling that to someone with no morals obviously doesn't do anything to help. I would be woken up at 2 a.m. by our room lights getting turned on, once when I had a 7:30 a.m. final that morning, nothing was done for months. Finally I was offered a different room

Fast forward to this year. At first I didn't even want to live in a dorm anymore. I'm a very independent person and I wasn't feeling too good about being put back into a random pool of potential roommates given the situation I was in last year. However, all transfers, got really close quickly. Everyone was really friendly, which is something my school is known for. However, there was one girl in the group who, although she was very nice, was already getting on my nerves by the time we left. She spent most of the orientation talking about herself, but that we would all request to be housed with other transfers so we could all be together. There was an immediate bond between us because of our similar situations. A few weeks later we got our rooming assignments. I was placed with the girl who had gotten on my nerves within 24 hours of knowing her. I'll call her C.

At first I went into the situation with a very positive feeling. We were able to meet up over the summer

Looking back, including the spots that were supposed to be mine. Her bottled waters, for example, were on my dresser. At this point we were still friends and I didn't care enough to ask her to move them. For the first few weeks things were generally fine in our room. Trying to be friendly and non-confrontational, I let a lot of things go that, looking back, I should have addressed right away. She wouldn't use headphones. Ever. Even if I was sleeping. Her boyfriend, would be over all hours of the night. She also made a lot of rude comments without thinking about them, she said that she didn't even remember saying it, would instead leave our door wide open and leave for extended periods of time. Personally I don't care if she wants to leave her stuff vulnerable

To be honest, but I would ask her to do or not do something and she would be doing or not doing that same thing again the next day. I literally asked her 4 different times to wear headphones while I was clearly sleeping. I decided that I needed to do something, so I went to my RA. Considering that my RA last year was a joke, I was so happily surprised to find that my new one was incredibly understanding and genuinely wanted to help me. After telling her my story she even said that although as an RA she wasn't supposed to pick sides, she definitely had my back. She encouraged me to have another conversation with her about what was bothering me, and eventually we met together with her. It was decided that we needed to rewrite our room contract, because the first time we did it I was the one writing everything down while she didn't show much interest at all. Our first contract was also very vague because at the time it was written I figured that whatever problems we had we could handle them on our own. Obviously not the case. Anyway, seeing it as a fresh start for our room and by this time needing some serious changes in the way things were going. I went over every question and wrote out what I would want to see, send your boyfriend home at a reasonable hour on school nights, this time with both of us contributing and compromising. We both got some of what we wanted

Turns out I was wrong, I keep a pitcher of water in the fridge that we rented together. C has her own pitcher that sits on her desk collecting dust. Until a few weeks ago, I wasn't aware that she had been using my pitcher without asking. It sounds stupid that it annoys me, but it's mostly the fact that I made it clear that I wanted to be asked first before she used my stuff and she was doing the opposite right in front of my face. It made me wonder what other things of mine she was using when I wasn't around. This didn't become a huge issue though until she drank from the pitcher, without using a cup, right in front of my face. I should have said something, but at the time I was so shocked that I didn't even know what to say. I later asked her to wash the pitcher and refill it, I let it go because I didn't want to restart drama and tension in the room.

Throughout all of this, but deleted it a few weeks later. Once things became really frustrating with her, I slowly fell back into the habit of tweeting about her, thinking that since she had deleted her account that she wouldn't see them. And in a weird way, I almost wanted her to see them. Obviously this seems really stupid to me now, but I thought that maybe if she saw my tweets about how annoying she was that she would finally understand and I wouldn't have to keep asking her everything multiple times. Anyway, she reactivated her account a few days ago, she saw everything. Honestly, and today was moved to a completely different room on campus. I have told everyone involved that I am more than willing to continue living with her in our room since it is inconvenient for either of us to be changing rooms right now with finals coming up only a week from now. However

This is the beginning of my frustration. I am trying to be civil, but if she is the one who is so angry and thinks she might try to fight me then why shouldn't she leave? The other problem I've been dealing with is that this girl is at least as guilty as I am, if not more. I overheard a conversation she had today on the phone with someone (because she didn't think enough to even leave our floor) where she talked all kinds of shit about me and said things even worse than what I tweeted about her. Also, I opened our fridge and there is an empty bottle of wine laying in the bottom. Of course I texted my RA what's been going on in my absence, and her reply was that because the bottle is empty that there's nothing she can do. I'm not saying that any of that excuses what I did, but I feel like it's pretty unfair that I'm being treated like a criminal for making fun of her but she's literally doing things that are against the law and nothing is happening to her. At this point we are supposed to go before a conduct board of our peers on Thursday, at which point they will decide what sanction I will receive. From what I've been told it won't be anything extreme, I am the victim in this situation but it is being treated like the other way around. I am a good student, sorry for the rant. I just have a lot of feelings.",t5_2qh3z

----------History-----------

So last Fall Semester I started my first semester at a 4-year University. I transferred from a community college nearby, getting time in with professors, etc. I thought things would go smoothly in the transfer, and that I would have all my bases covered and do fine. I should state before I get into this that I've had a history of depression at least 3 times in my past. 2007 it was so bad I rarely left my bedroom for almost a year. I started noticing before starting that the symptoms of it were on-setting toward the end of summer just before the semester began, but I put it off as nervousness.

I was wrong. My first semester I bombed my Calculus class, putting me on Academic Warning. I found the classes to be naturally more difficult than I was used to, though not harder than I could take, and finding friends became a huge challenge since the campus population grew. I rarely found time to get with my professors, and when I did I found it hard to find things to even talk to them about. I sought the help of the school counselors about the depressed feelings I was having, but found myself either lying to them instead of being honest about it, or forgetting their advice the moment I walked out the door.

I thought, you'll do good in the Spring, just apply yourself."" but I underestimated the depressed feeling I'd been having. My entire semester for spring I bombed. I attended class for about a month and a half before all my cares left me and I just didn't see a point in continuing. I didn't bother seeing the counselors at the university because I didn't see how it was helping. I just fell out, stopped going for the most part, and gave up.

This spell lasted until about the beginning of June. I forced myself to stop smoking, eating more fruits and vegetables instead of resorting to quick solutions like fast food and frozen dinners. I've only recently starting exercising more, but I feel it's helped. Lastly, I've been studying independently everyday to pass the classes I plan to retake, so I feel I'm more than ready to begin.

---------Problem------------

The problem is this. I bombed last semester, or that I've gotten better. Furthermore, the bill of tuition (5000$) is due on July 23rd. I can ask for an extension till the end of August, but there's no guarantee I'll get it. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. Should I bother writing an appeal, especially in one month. I really want to continue college, get my degree and be done with it so all the loans wouldn't be a complete waste.  What should I or can I do at this point? What would you suggest reddit?

-----TL:DR-------

I got depressed, but have no documented proof of the depressive episode to bring up. I'm out of options, out of time, and out of ideas. What can I do?",,False,,False,t3_wjt25

-Applied around to a few schools, WA.
-Tuition/board would be about $20K a semester with all scholarships taken into account.

Why am I having second thoughts?
-Not so sure how I feel about Spokane
-Don't think I am mature (emotionally or otherwise) enough to live on my own yet.
-Not sure that the education in WA would be worth the money/leaving California.

Mental list of pros I have off the top of my head for each school type:
Whitworth/University:
-Small campus (~2500 students
-Closer relationship with the professors
-Decent debate team
-Student body appeared close when I visited

Community College (for you Californiaers, or something surrounding)
-Close
-Debate team at OCC looks good
-Allows me to transfer off to a UC later
-Allows me to remain in my comfort zone a bit and ease me into a UC/living on my own later as I inherit responsibilities little-by-little

**Myths**

&gt; You need to file your taxes before you can fill out the FAFSA.

There is an option on the FAFSA to choose ""will update later""

You can update it with the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, wait a week and try again. It takes a couple weeks to update the database.

The advantage to this is that you can submit your FAFSA *now*

&gt; You have to pay to file the FAFSA.

FALSE. There are places that will do this legally and for a fee (there is an option on the FAFSA for so called ""preparers"" to tell the government that they prepared it for somebody else)

However, it's worth it), it is COMPLETELY **FREE** TO SUBMIT A FAFSA.

Make sure you go to [fafsa.gov](http://fafsa.gov)

&gt; You only need to file the FAFSA once.

The FAFSA needs to be filed every year

Check, your dependency status. Most likely, you'll be a dependent of your parents for a while, but for others such as veterans or married students, or students who support themselves, claiming independent status can net you more aid, should you meet the requirements.

**Tips**

* FILE NOW.

Go back up to the top myth

Example: I found out my EFC is $22

* File online.

Hands down the best way to do so. It's faster, it tells you exactly what each field is and what line of your 1044, EZ-1044, 1044-A form you can find the necessary info on.

* You will need, tax info for whoever will be filing (including the student) taxes in the 2013 calendar year, and knowledge of worth of liquid savings and checkings account, etc.

1343716338.0,xfr6t,"What is the ""college experience""?",itsgreater9000,13,5,31,"I keep reading about the ""college experience""

My personal plan for college is simply to do really well while working a job at the same time, I don't think I would care going to parties. I'm a decently popular guy, but parties just aren't my thing, and on top of that I can make friends pretty well, so I don't have too much of a care when it comes to making friends (in fact, I met two great kids at orientation for school that I talk to regularly). So the social aspect of college kids seem to be worrying about (or maybe I just notice people worrying about it) doesn't bother me.

I was sure that college was a factory that churned out good workers, or going off to graduate school. Whilst bad workers got dumped into shitty jobs and regretted going into massive debt. Is my impression all wrong? Does the typical college student truly party a bunch, drink a bunch, and not care about school work? How do they pass?

Now, game development is a pretty specific (and probably competitive) occupation, and my father insists that any job you can get as a computer scientist you can also get as a computer engineer, but not necessarily the other way around. In other words, he believes that computer engineering contains computer science, and that a degree in computer science may not offer as many (or as high quality) jobs as computer engineering may offer. Is he correct?

So basically, and I'm not sure if computer engineering covers the more intense, algorithmic subjects that computer science touches upon. What is the difference between the two subjects, and which should I choose if I wanted to work for, say, a game developing company?

I'm just really confused. Any help is greatly appreciated and thanks in advance.

I'd like to go on to get a Master's and a PhD at a ""highly selective"" university for graduate school (LSE, Columbia-I'm trying to shoot as high as possible).  


My question to r/college is what can I do now, what will the intensity of work be like at a 4-year on the quarter system?  I'm constantly told that the work is 10x harder than community college, which makes me nervous.

I'm a 16 year old from the UK. I'm in my 5th year at secondary school but as far as I'm aware that means I'm a sophomore in the US. I'm a straight A student, I've considered going to a US university more and more. Mainly because I've visited the US a lot, and I love it every time. Also, due to the fact that it is getting increasingly harder to get into medical school in the UK.

I'm really passionate about trying to get into a Uni in the US, etc. is really daunting. I want to get started early to try and give myself a head start, and make the process as manageable as possible.

I know I have to take the SAT I, but apart from that, I'm really lost.

I'm going to the US in July for 14 days to look at Universities. I'm staying with a friend who got accepted into Princeton this month. However

I'm thinking of applying to a few schools to study medicine

* Princeton
* Harvard
* NYU
* Geogretown
* Columbia
* MIT

There are lots of questions I have

* How do I apply to colleges?
* When do I apply?
* If I get asked for interview
* How do I cope with SATs
* Would colleges understand my circumstances if I got a lower score than a US student
* I've been told I have to write essays of some sorts for university applications and on my SATs
* How much of a role do extra-curricular activities/voluntary work play in getting accepted to Medical school?
* Will the fact I get Straight A's/A+'s help me
* Is there any other important information I'm missing?

If anyone has actually got this far, but I worry a lot about my schoolwork, my grades, universities and my future generally. I know medical school is a huge aspiration, but I know if I work hard enough, it's not out of my reach. I really don't want to look back on this in years to come and regret not preparing well for Uni applications or exams. Any help or replies would mean a lot.
