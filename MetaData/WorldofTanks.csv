I am The_Chieftain (real name Nicholas Moran. I can say that, granted, is a bit unusual, after having lived so many years in Ireland. However, I now have two American roles. Firstly Wargaming found me at a local tank museum, and decided to bring me on to bring a bit of first-hand knowledge  into the office. I was playing WoT long before I met Wargaming in person, mind. Secondly, currently I’m a member of the Nevada Army National Guard, where, was an optimistic college choice.
Within the office, I like to think I’m a part of the player community as much as an interaction with them, but that may just be my optimism.
Outside the office, model, and tease cats with laser pointers because I believe them to be evil. This has resulted in some conflict with Gaea.

However, I now have two American roles. Firstly Wargaming found me at a local tank museum, and decided to bring me on to bring a bit of first-hand knowledge into the office. I was playing WoT long before I met Wargaming in person, I hold a commission in the US Army, Afghanistan and South Dakota. This is the result of a mis-spent youth, which in hindsight

* The M4 Sherman was called the ""Tommykocher"" (""Tommy Cooker"") amongst German soldiers because it was prone to catching fire in its early versions.

* The M3 Lee was known as ""A grave for six friends"" amongst the Russians

* The Ferdinand was powered by two petrol engines that powered two generators which powered two electromotors. Because it was underpowered

* The gratings above the front-mounted engine of the Ferdi were also a weak point, setting the engine ablaze! (source: ""Heavy Tank Destroyers"" by Walter J. Spielberger, Thomas Jentz and Hilary L. Doyle).

* The ABC protection of the German Leopard 2 tank can also be used as an air conditioner

* Some German crewmen claim to have accelerated a Leopard 2 (with its ~60 tons of weight) to 116 km/h (72 mph) on a German highway

* Many German tanks throughout history had the ability to dive up to 4.5m (almost 15 ft)

* One of the most bizzarre incidents involving Tiger tanks happened near Anzio, requiring the crews to evacuate the tanks to dig out the barrels! (source: ""Tiger Tank"" by Roger Ford)

* American Shermans in the pacific area used HE rounds against Japanese tanks

* Shermans usually kept an HE round loaded as their first shot, hoping to damage at least optics or tracks. One Sherman shot *30* HE rounds against a single Tiger and managed to knock the crew out, as it expired from concussion!

1366780484.0,1czqet,So you want to know how to passive scout?,JBWill,134,12,75,"A lot of people I've talked to have had problems figuring out how to be a useful passive scout, and I have figured out a lot of spots that I like and seem to work pretty well.

At its heart, which will let you spot enemy tanks further away and sooner.  Training camo skills on your crew is also very important, as it will make you less likely to be spotted both getting into and sitting in your spot.  Most light tanks are fine with just crew camo training, but some lights and most mediums will be made much more effective by also mounting a camo net.  Also one thing I can't stress enough:  **SIXTH SENSE IS SUPER IMPORTANT**.  Get it first for a passive scout (or really pretty much anything) always.  It's extremely valuable to know when you're spotted so A) you can run away as soon as possible (you may be spotted even if no one is shooting/aiming at you, and chances are good if you don't know and don't move, you're going to catch an arty shell pretty quick) and B) so you can start to know what you can get away with, and how close people have to get to actually spot you.  Just remember two important things: one is that Sixth Sense has a 3 second delay, so no matter how good your camo is,  I still highly recommend j1mbo's just because it's awesome

Good passive scouting tanks include

* T-50
* T-50-2
* Luchs
* Pz38nA
* Chaffee
* ELC AMX
* AMX 12t
* AMX 13-75
* AMX 13-90
* T71
* 59-16
* WZ-131
* WZ-132
* Type 62

Those are all tanks that I would consider not really needing camo nets (unless you haven't trained camo on their crews yet).  Tier 10 games will also often include Batchats, which are all more likely to need a camo net if they want to remain unspotted longer.

*Note that I'm not saying the tanks in that list should only be used for passive scouting

So, but most of them should be pretty close.  This is also obviously not a complete list of every good passive scouting spot (or even every map), there are a lot more that I sometimes use, and I'm sure there are all sorts of good ones that I don't know about.  [**Here's the album.**](http://imgur.com/a/FMYf8)  The light icons are the locations you can sit (green icon indicates from side 1, red is from side 2), and the yellow lines indicate the range you'll usually be looking/spotting.

A quick rundown of the different maps:

**Arctic Region**  
Not the greatest passive scouting map

**Cliff**  
These spots are pretty short term.  If you rush to the spots on that ridge at the very beginning, or even know they're vulnerable.

**Erlenberg**  
From those spots you can keep pretty much anything defending the north/south bridges lit

**Fjords**  
Fairly self explanatory.  Only try the spot in B7 if you've got really good camo

**Highway**  
Again fairly self explanatory

**Lakeville**  
A very fun map to passive scout on.  From those two spots you can light anything the other team has heading to the town allowing arty and your teammates to get shots in.  You're far enough away that you can actually often take pot shots at them yourself without getting spotted (depending on your tank and their positions).  From the south side

**Live Oaks**  
This is one that I had problems pinpointing where the spots were on the map.  The green icon is actually in a spot where there's two trees right next to each other

**Malinovka**  
Probably the easiest map to passive scout on.  The spots are all fairly self explanatory.  For the spot in F5

**Mountain Pass**  
That spot from side 1 will spot things crossing H6.

**Murovanka**  
I actually should have put the green icon more down where the red icon is.  You can pretty much just find any bush in the magical forest and sit in it

**Redshire**  
Pretty straightforward.

**Steppes**  
From that bush looking either direction you'll spot pretty much anything heading east.  It also provides you with handy arty cover that you can duck into as soon as you're spotted.

**Westfield**  
These spots are all pretty unaggressive passive scouting spots

One last important note before I succumb to the alcohol that I have imbibed this night and go to sleep.  If you're planning on passive scouting a particular area, Live Oaks, etc), **COMMUNICATE YOUR INTENTION WITH YOUR TEAM**.  Let your arty know that you're going to be giving them easy targets in a specific place before the match even begins.  That way they can pre aim in that area and be ready to unleash hell upon the people you spot.  It doesn't do much good to spot all those people if no one is ready for it, because chances are high that by the time they have a chance to turn and aim, it's already going to be too late.

Also, but it can also be highly effective if you do it right.

Ok, or if you're lucky someone else who's probably way better at this than I am can answer them.

**EDIT** Speaking of people who are way better than me at this:  [Here's an example of the power of passive scouting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1cznoc/type_62_charlie_has_nothing_on_me_212k_credits/)",self,t5_2s113,1366827236.0,,usplayer,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1czqet/so_you_want_to_know_how_to_passive_scout/

Boring ass life story:
Hi I'm a bad that pads, because I play this game like call of duty, because it's boring not shooting things. I was just solopubbing and generally being bad for my first  couple thousands of battles (it was tier 6 were I found out you actually had to wait for the reticle to aim in lol, before that I just fired full bloom). Was 55% at the time, because somehow despite knowing about aim time, I still could carry games in my baddie form. At this point I joined one of the best clans on the server at the time, and learned a lot from their members and the world of tanks forums. For the longest time I thought I was going to be stuck at 55% forever, my w/r would go up, did the serious w/r climb began. I found a few players with similarily aggressive playstyles like mine

65% w/r overall
80% w/r last 60 days
http://www.noobmeter.com/player/na/worstplayer_na
http://wotlabs.net/na/player/worstplayer_na

So here we go.

Part 1:

What stats are important:

1. W/R, you can can pad your wn7 all you want , but if you can't win, then you're still bad. I've played with superunicums that all they do is farm the lower tiers and pad amazing dpgs, but they can't win because they don't put damage on the right targets at the right time, like they straight up farm a tiger instead of a e75 because dat dpg bro. Sure you can pad it by getting carried in platoons, or playing in tank companies all day

2. DPG, rule of thumb you want your average damage per game in a tank to be at least equal to your tanks hp.

3. Wn7/efficency w/e
Like I can play arty 24/7
However it's still useful as a general metric on a players skill.

Guidelines on w/r and skill:

Assuming  they aren't padded as fuck from tank companies or seal clubbing;

45% and under: I can't tell if you're a bot or a real player
46-48%: Bad@tanks and where the average pubbie lies
49-52%: Pretty good in comparison to the average pubbie
53-55%: where most of the ""okaish to good"" player lie
56-60%: Nearing the unicum status
60%-64%: Unicums
65%+ : we're all dirty stat padders and really aren't that good mkay

You might think, players with 10k+ battles the average is actually 53%, because new players typically lose more as they learn to play the game. So infact the average player at 10k battles is actually 53% and thus 48%ers are bads that drag down their team.

Do you feel offended being called a bad? Well have no fear
____________________________________________________________________________

PART 2: HOW 2 WIN

First of all: come up with a gameplan to win. A common mistake I see players have is that they entire a pub match and just follow the horde

First look at their tank lineup: where do you think their tanks are going to go? If they have a shit ton of tds in murovanka north side, know which players are the largest threats(focus them first), but never overextend to kill a unicum, it's much better to kill his pubbie meatshields and swarm him later on, rather than yolodieing for the chance of damaging him. 

Look at their lineup, or hilly areas if they have a t29 stack).

Don't camp hard, 30 seconds if you don't have a firing lane on someone, and you can safely relocate, do it, because if you aren't in a position to spot or do damage, you are useless. Instead of camping to get favorable engagements, rather go aggressive and utilize map tricks to force the enemies into favorable engagements. I was going to write more map guides, but I'm lazy and I'll do it one day. But when you commit hard to a spot

Be aware of arty at all times, so learn where arty can't hit you in common arty spots and hug that cover for dear life, especially in high tier games. Playing arty will give you a much better idea on how this is done. I'm really trying to hammer this into my mindset, I'm spotted, I'm about to get fucked by arty so I better back down.

Have your tanks set up right, it's also in the reddit wot wiki. Have the best module set up and try to minimize how stock your tanks are, if you have spare gold, feel free to make yourself less of a burden to your team and at least get the best gun. 

Play good tanks if you really want to pad hard, it blows), and you can do well in them, just some do better than others.

Always be prepared for the cap-fast, never underestimate how retarded your pubbies can be, head back to base if you see they commit to cap fasting. Too many games I have lost because I asummed people were competent enough to defend.

Be flexible, head to the other side of the map(if you can do it safely) and turn the tide there. Really always think of where you can move if you don't think you are doing anything there. If you see replays on how I play, you'll see me roam the map hard, especially in mediums as I want to impact the game as much as I can.

**Get your mechanics down
** 
I can't stress this enough
(http://wotguru.com/weak-spot-guides/ is a good place to study them) and start to commit them into muscle memory you will see your damage dramatically go up, you'll get it down to that level too. Study the weakspots, practice on them ingame and eventually you'll get them down perfectly.

Don't hesitate to spam gold ammo: it's much easier with a premium account, never be put into a position where you don't have enough gold rounds to swing the match. Run 80% ap and 20% gold in most tanks, because if you're in a vk3601h and theirs a tiger p that needs to be dead now, don't be caught in the position where you can't pen him and thus the game is lost. Gold ammo is a tool to be used, nto and exploit

While Wargaming is my first foray into the publishing side of the game industry, where I picked up my first industry gig with Curse, Inc. thanks to some expansion leveling guides that I wrote. I worked there as Community Manager, Content Manager and Lead Editor over the course of a little more than five years before joining the team at Wargaming America.

My position at Wargaming America is Head of Community

I manage an incredibly cool and ridiculously talented team of professionals that cover:

* Community (Gaea
* Game Events (Major_Rampage) – Design in-game events and contests (specials, All Stars, etc.); create Gift Shop packages; plan real life player events (i.e. player gatherings)
* Content (hobbstrosity
* Social Media (Nyx) – Manage Facebook

I have my pulse on the development of all Wargaming products

I’m happy to also answer questions related to our event design philosophy

You might be tempted to downvote this thread as a means to tell Neb to fuck off. Don't. In fact
  
I am only going to tell you this once Neb. Leave. Get the fuck out. Yesterday pretty much all the officers and quite a few members of RDDT7 got in TS and talked about the state of the clan, angry or petty. This is me caring about the health of this clan. Numerous people have threatened to leave. Some probably already have (and I would have left because of this as well but it seems you can't leave twice). And there is no guarantee that they will remain in the RDDT family of clans. So now you are making every RDDT clan look bad.

1373255323.0,1hucan,the arty nerf is changing the metagame.,niuzeta,115,24,283,"i've played a fair amount of games since the 8.6 update. I've given the new artys a try and well

Yes, they still do reasonable amount of damage when hit. But other than that, the shell fly distance took a hit, aiming circle dispersion is ever so greater and *don't even get me started with the reloading time*.

When you play a game where you roll around a vehicle with heavy guns, and the (cost for making mistake is ever so high.* I'm speaking as a 50%-winrate public searcher and not a good player. Having survived the old M7 Priest, I think I can reasonably hit a moving target. Now I think again before even attempting to. Still, with the accuracy revamp they still hit reasonably well.

The point is that **arty is not as much fun as it used to be

Now let's look at lights. Pre-8.6, flanking, and arty hunting. In 3 or 4 arty games it was worthwhile for the lights(1375, 1390, etc) to sneak into the enemy base because the artys would realign their cannons and shoot at the enemies they've lighted, or even take a shot at artys.

Now, *and* since the accuracy buff you're more likely to get hit. Also, with less artys on the enemy side there's suddenly less motivation to risk going into the enemy base. Thus, less artys in game severely limits lights' roles in each game.

If you like heavies-vs-heavies-while-mediums-flank type of brawl, and wreck havoc in enemy lines. During the weekend I've seen my playstyle in each game changing into more of a flanker and a passive scout. Suddenly playing lights weren't as fun. I picked up meds and heavies and they were great; especially when there were less arty fires to worry about.(there are less artys in the field, and even if one hit, I could count the next thirty seconds to be free, for example)

the metagame of world of tanks was successful, each class was dependent on the others' presence in game. If there are less artys in game, then lights will soon follow the trend. *That* is what I worry.

**TL;DR: since 8.6, limits the roles of lights(active scouting, infiltration, and arty hunting), and the games are more played like simple brawls than pre-8.6 metagame.**

1357250135.0,15wtn1,Taking Advantage of Artillery: A Guide,LincLoL,109,17,65,"Hey all! I've been seeing a lot of teams misusing/mistreating their artillery lately
**For a tl;dr

First

* **They are firing at targets in your vicinity.** This is pretty much a no-brainer. If artillery is firing at the same target as you

* **They are firing at targets that are not in your vicinity.** Okay, the tanks on the other team will see that. It doesn't really matter which side of the map the artillery is firing on, because **just by firing they're bringing down the other team's morale** and giving you opportunities to attack when your target hesitates.

* **They are not firing at all.** This is not so much of a no-brainer. Let's say your artillery hasn't fired a single shot. Maybe they're afk. Odds are

Second, odds are your team left the east flank wide open and artillery has to concentrate their fire on that flank to defend their own asses! **If you see a big gap in a flank** (i.e. your team went to one side of the map) then **go to that flank!** Hang back, hide behind cover, and spot for the artillery! Take some shots if it's safe, but your main job now is to **support the artillery!**

Third

* Your team (and **you) left a flank wide open.** See example above.

* You did not **communicate effectively with your artillery** (see below).

* **Artillery couldn't get a shot on your target(s).** This is a very common occurrence, they very well might not have been able to get a clean shot on your target. If your target is sitting right up against a building or hill or any other obstruction, it's most likely very hard to get a shot on your target. This brings me to my next point...

Fourth, you’ll see that it’s not as easy as you might have originally thought. Also, you’ll learn new tactics to avoid being killed by artillery if you actually know how they work. **There's a lot that comes with playing artillery** that a lot of people are ignorant about, including:

* **Shell travel time:** unless you're really good at artillery

* **Reload time:** most artillery are very powerful. This is balanced by the large amount of time they take to reload after every shot.

* **Movement:** artillery usually isn't very agile or fast. **It takes a while for artillery to change position or maneuver** between shots. Also, your hull has to move to adjust and this resets the aiming time. 

* **Aiming time:** this is usually also quite long. And as I said above

* **Armor:** some are artillery are strong and can take a few hits,** coupled with their lack of mobility **makes them very prone to small, fast tanks** that easily slip through the front-line defenses.

My fifth

* **Requesting fire.** The default key for this is your ""T"" key. **Simply aim at a target and press ""T"".** This will ping the map, odds are **you'll catch your artillery's attention and receive supporting fire in seconds.** Just hang tight, keep the enemy spotted, and **let your artillery support you.**

* **Pinging the map.** This is just as important as requesting fire. Hold down your ""ctrl"" key and left-click anywhere on your minimap to draw attention to a certain location. **Artillery can see tracers, etc.** and if you **tell them where to look,** they'll be able to blindly **shoot at the enemy** and have a pretty good chance of hitting them.
* **Using chat.** If you feel that the time is right, and tell them you’re most likely going to spot a few targets for them, **they’ll have your back.**

* Okay, but use your imagination. Also, when you do get them out of cover, **don't go for weak spots** to try and damage them. If you hit them, they'll just roll back into cover and sit there, still alive. Instead, **track them! Aim for their treads, and let artillery do its job.** Nothing is better as artillery than having an immobile target to shoot at; it's like **shooting fish in a barrel!**

Well, and understand artillery a little bit more, I've accomplished what I set out to do!

Let me give it to you straight boys, usually negative, involving one of your girlfriend's or wife's insecurities.  Think it can't happen in WoT?  You`re wrong.

I usually decorate my tanks with the Canadian flag and peace symbol.  When I reached my first tier X tank, I noticed the inscription ""Greta"" was available (my wife's nickname).  What a great way to honour my wife and show her how important she is to me and that I think about her even when I'm gaming those hours a day downstairs.  I decorated the tank and then showed my wife.  Here are two possible endings to this story.  Guess which one actually happened.

A.  My wife shed tears of joys as she embraced me warmly and reminded me what a stud I was and how my excessive gaming turned her on.

B.  My wife took one look at that fat ugly German tank destroyer and broke down in tears because it was ""an obvious"" allusion to what she sees as her excessive weight and that was why I would associate her name with that fat f*****g tank.  I am now persona non gratas around here as I get the old cold shoulder.  F*****g Nazis!

1365912476.0,1cb5gn,Tier 10 CW Crewskills/Modules Guide,liquiddrugs,103,20,90,"Requested by clanmates

How to setup the ""useful"" aka most played tier 10 tanks.

Part 1:
GET 6TH SENSE FIRST ON EVERY TANK DON'T BE A FUCKING RETARD AND PASS OVER OP PERK THAT IS SO USEFUL ESPECIALLY IN MID/END GAME WHERE IT BECOMES MAP HACKS
Ok?

**Tier 10 Mediums**

**Batchat+T62a**

Commander:
Sixth Sense/Camo/Repair/Recon

Gunner:
Camo/Snapshot/Repair/Designated Target

Driver:
Camo/Clutch breaking(smooth ride on 62)/Repair/off road driving

Loader(on t62)
Camo/repair/safe stowage

Modules:
Gunlaying/Optics/Vertstab

**Explanation**:
Camo first, as this has no armor.  Clutch breaking due to very shitty terrain passability when turning, at max speed the agility improvement is very noticeable. Don't get offroad driving on the t62, as it's terrain coefficents are already very, very good.
Snap shot is because of the terrible dispersion on the turret, insanely high dpm. However in certain maps roles/ binocs/camo net might has use. *Camo skill also reduces the time you are lite for (read the xml files)*

**Tier 10 Tds**

**Foch155+E3+268** (and no fuck you e4 lovers

Commander:
Sixth Sense/ Repair(camo first on 268)/ Camo/BIA

Gunner:
Repair/Camo/Snapshot(it works on tds

Driver:
Repair/Camo/Clutchbreaking/BIA

Loader:

Repair/Camo/Safestowage/BIA

Modules:
Gunlaying/Rammer/Vents (replace rammer with toolkit/optics on foch)

**Explanation**:
Repair first on nonturreted tds, then 3rd set get things that improve your soft stats. BIA for 4th, really it's overrated and rushing it is not as effective.

Modules are to maximize up time and damage output.

**
T10 Heavies**

**E100/110E5/T57**

Commander:
Sixth Sense/Repair/BIA or camo for 3/4th based on preference (obviously not camo on e100)

Gunner:
Repair/Snapshot/ bia or camo

Driver:
Repair/Clutchbreaking/ bia or camo

Loader:

Repair/ Safestowage / Bia or camo

Modules:

Gunlaying(or vents)/vertstab/Rammer

Explanation:

Skills are there to maximize soft stats and up time once again. Camo's actually very underated

Modules is debatable

**
Tier 8 Arty:**
(note get camo 2nd on bat 155)

Commander:

6th Sense/ BIA/ Camo

Gunner:

Snap shot(it works on arty

Driver:

Clutch Breaking/ BIA / Camo

Loader:

Repair/Bia/camo

Modules:

Gunlaying/rammer/camo net(replace rammer with like repair kit or something on the 155)

**Explanation**:

Camo actually sucks on tier 8 arty, so get it anyways. Like if you test out camo skill on tier 8 arty, it makes almost no difference.

1361303254.0,18u3kv,The lazy flanking maneuver,hoofit,87,6,68,"Hello tankers.  I'm going to describe an effective and low risk flanking maneuver.  It's a really simple thing to do but so many tankers mess it up and get killed too early when the try to flank enemy heavies.  This tactic is best used on city maps when the heavy tanks on each side are slugging it out. It's very useful when you are under tiered.  Here's how it works:

* Wait until your heavies and the enemy heavies are engaged in battle
* Ideally there will be a cluster of enemy heavies
* Using cover
* Shoot one of them and see what happens
* If they don't turn towards you then keep plugging away.  You can do tremendous damage if they ignore you.
* If you see their turrets turning towards you then try to make one more shot before reversing back behind a building or other cover.
* Now here is the lazy part.  Now that you are behind cover all you need to do is sit there.  Do not rush out and take another shot if their turrets are facing towards you.  You will die.
* Look around the corner by right clicking and rotating the camera.  Watch what the enemy heavies are doing.
* If 1 or more enemy tanks keep their turrets pointed at you then you are doing your job.  You have effectively taken their enemy tanks out of the battle without taking any damage yourself.
* If they turn their turrets back towards your heavies (away from you) then leave cover and shoot them again.  Rinse and repeat.

This tactic is especially powerful because it confuses and frustrates your enemies.  Everybody hates being flanked.  But they especially hate being flanked by tanks they cannot shoot back at.

Like I said

Good luck.  And remember,False,self,t5_2s113,False,,usplayer,t3_18u3kv

I wanted to give you a peek into the community we now have on /r/WorldofTanks.

When I first join this sub-reddit we had just a few hundred subscribers and RDTT2 had just been accidentally created. My win rate was a solid 47% with my highest tank of a M6 Heavy. The RDDT clans had about 120 members. Oh how times have changed...

**Clans:**

Now, 5 EU clans, and one red headed step child. Both EU and NA have been seeing a surge of growth recently. All in all, **we have over 1,000 players** in RDDT based clans across these two servers. We are also looking at starting a RDDT SEA based clan as interest has been shown. We are one of the largest communities of players in tanks, if not the largest. 

**Teamspeak**

You guys keep breaking teamspeak, so for that we have to say thanks. You guys make this possible.

**Wargaming** 

We have had 5 AMAs from Wargaming staff

* [Sergey Burkatovskiy

* [Kevin Van Ness \(a.k.a. GeneralDirection\)

* [The Chieftain

* [The Chieftain

* [Jeremy Monroe

We also have employees /u/Ectar_WG and /u/CatStalker-WG post quite frequently on the sub-reddit

Behind the scenes, we are the largest community for talking about all things world of tanks.

1374695236.0,1iz6xf,[TOMORROW] The 10k Community Night kicks off at 9pm EST!,Deutschbagger,89,20,67,"Subredditers!  Tomorrow night (*Thursday, we are adding four new events into the Community Night fray [based upon *your* suggestions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1hrm1y/attention_looking_to_revamp_community_night/)  These new events

*NEW* **BATTLE BRIDGE** 

* Two teams of 15 tanks compete for control of the bridge by pushing and ramming each other off to certain death.  Shooting and backing off the bridge are forbidden
* Starting with Tier I
* Maps include Mountain Pass, and Serene Coast

*NEW* **HIDE-AND-SEEK**

* One team of 15 hiders have two minutes to hide while one seeker remains AFK.  Then the seeker attempts to find all 15 hiders.  Last few tanks to be found win.
* One judge/host will also be in game
* Open to all tiers and all tanks
* There will be no practice rounds
* Maps include: Abbey, Sacred Valley, Westfield, Highway
* Prizes include: *3x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

*NEW* **THE LONG JUMP**

* Take a tank of your choice to try and jump further than all others.  This event is open to 28 participants with one judge/host and one corpse-clearer
* There will be a practice jump
* Maps include: El Halluf
* Prizes include: *3x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

*NEW* **PZ. 1C RACING**

* Race at speeds upwards of 79 km/h against 29 other opponents.  Similar to ELC Racing except that the Pz. 1C actually turns better.  
* As with all races
* Maps include: [well you'll just have to find out!](http://i.imgur.com/AmVEYiO.gif)
* Prizes include: *1x* [Pz. Kpfw. B2 740](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/Pz.Kpfw._B2_740_%28f%29) w/ garage slot, and *1x* 3 days of Premium w/ 300 gold

**ELC RACING**

* Practice laps for each map
* Maps include: [Dragon's Ridge, Pearl River, Port, Sacred Valley, and Swamp](http://imgur.com/a/Yg6iN)
* Prizes include: *1x* [Pz. Kpfw. B2 740](http://wiki.worldoftanks.com/Pz.Kpfw._B2_740_%28f%29) w/ garage slot

**BATTLE BOATS**

* Arguably RDDT's national sport.  Two teams of 15 SPGs fight like handicapped tanks by never stopping and never backing up
* Take *any* SPG you feel like and fire on the move
* Map: Malinovka 

Be sure to have sufficient credits in your bank and enough coffee to keep you going.  More details will be released as we go.  Your three hosts for tomorrow night will be [myself](http://worldoftanks.com/community/accounts/1000955324-Gottfried_von_Brunn3n/), The Long Jump, Pz. 1C Racing, and ELC Racing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7HgrVZhV13P70WlRSnK6Knrf3S8hMSsHZGbDRsgDsA/edit#slide=id.p) will be determined.  [We cannot thank WG enough for their donated prizes.](http://i.imgur.com/fQ7cy3A.gif)

We have gotten some complaints that a few sister clan's members (RDTT2/RDDT3-X) are teamkilling and harassing Enjoy/Enjoy2 in random battles. This is not cool, please do not take this out on people who had nothing to do with it. They are just trying to play the game. 


When you teamkill Enjoy [- _ -] or EnjoyToo [- _ -2] members, push them around, or mess with them in any way. Take the high ground. We do not want people thinking ""well, if a deal goes south with RDDT all their clans will TK us"" and refuse to work with us. People generally like the RDDT clans, I want to keep it that way. 
    

**Just Stop.**

1358531436.0,16tsey,5 Keys to Effective Passive Scouting,Azrou,70,8,28,"***5 Keys to Effective Passive Scouting***

1. **Knowledge**: understand how the spotting system, because the maximum spotting range is 445 meters.  Many light and medium tanks can remain undetected at 300-350 meters even while in an open field because of their natural camouflage.  Light tanks maintain the same natural camouflage regardless of whether they are moving or still.
2. **Tank selection**: lights and mediums make the best passive scouts, AMX 1390, BatChat, Chaffee, and T-54.  At higher tiers, passive scouting is extremely valuable because your teammates are more likely to actually damage the targets you are spotting.  At lower tiers, sometimes you simply have to do the damage yourself.
3. **Equipment/skills**: Unlike other stats such as reload and aim time that are expected to exceed their listed values, but binoculars are also powerful.  Your most effective work is done on the margins of spotting range from 400-445 meters, and equipment is required to reach this.  Other skills and equipment that can help are ventilation, brothers in arms, recon, situational awareness, and camouflage boosters.  Sixth sense should be the first completed skill on your commander and will increase your survival rate substantially.
4. **Map familiarity**: seek out a bush or tree in a central area that controls as much of the map as possible and that you can reach quickly without putting yourself in danger.  Examples: E8 on Malinovka
5. **Decision-making**: do not fire unless it is necessary for your survival or you are absolutely sure you will not be detected.  Firing removes 75-85% of all camouflage sources including your natural rating, bushes, and paint.  In addition, any bushes or trees within 15 meters  drop an additional 70% of their bonus.  You must weigh whether firing and losing cover is more beneficial than maintaining sight on enemies that would not otherwise be visible to your teammates.  You may do several hundred damage but be forced to abandon your position, vs. friendly tanks and artillery potentially doing thousands of damage.  But, sometimes it can be worth it if you are finishing off a wounded tank or intend to relocate anyway.

Here is an example replay: http://mwreplays.com/replay/UWC2HFY8BC8B/

1359393373.0,17fqvd,An open letter to the pub clans complaining about Clan Wars fairness,DamienJaxx,88,26,83,"Hi there!

So you’re upset about this whole WG North American Clan Wars fiasco
 
Ask yourself, you use that gold to fight for more land. Your success attracts new members. Your success gets you invited to alliances.

“But how the hell do I break into clan wars with my measly 30-40 members with 2-3 tier 10’s among them?” you may be asking. Do what we (RDDT) did. Get serious about it.

Let’s talk about some history of RDDT. At the time I joined RDDT and began working with others to get RDDT into clan wars, we were a pub clan existing only to provide a home to fellow Redditors. How many tier 10’s do you think we had at the time? I can tell you, not enough to field a clan wars team.

That changed because myself and a few others GOT SERIOUS. How do you get serious? Start small and work your way up. Here are some tips:

* Set up a Mumble server (now TeamSpeak). This is essential; if you can’t afford TS
* Get on scribblar or Advanced Tactical Center (Scribblar is better because people don’t need to download anything). Develop strategies on the maps you want to play. Make sure people are on the same page. Don’t you dare pull a fucking pub strat in CW. Clan wars is a different beast. People actually work together
* Do some tank companies. Run Champion companies if you can
* Make sure you get at least one clan wars team. Fill it with tier 10’s of whatever you have at the time. If you don’t have tier 10’s
* Sign up for tournaments. RDDT entered its first tournament mere weeks after reorganizing. How did we do? Oh
* Start in Africa (soon to be Mexico). Those clans down there? Yeah
* Accept failure. Adapt. I should probably put this up at top because it’s the most important point. You WILL lose. You will get your face curb stomped by another clan. You will get backstabbed by “allies” and you will cry. What will you do after that? Bitch on the forums and get ridiculed, you bet we’re going to look at it and use it next time.
* Know when to cut your losses. If you’re firing more gold than you’re earning (usually the case in Africa/Mexico)
* Know when you suck at running battles. Yeah
* Diplomacy is key. Most clans get over-extended quickly. That means they have holes in their defenses and are open to attacks from all over. They want to make a deal so that they can protect their back side. Contact other commanders/diplomats in the region you’re attacking. Get invited into their alliances (yes
* Accept the fact that the big clans won’t talk to you. Until you land in Europe and make a name for yourself
* Don’t get cocky. That next clan you’ve never heard of is going to roll over you and you won’t know what hit you. Take them seriously no matter how bad you think they are.
* Get serious

How long did it take RDDT to go from reorganization to clan wars? 1 month. How long did it take for us to enter Africa then Europe? 1 month.

I know that’s a lot to take in. And yeah, and get your clan up and running.

If you need help

**TL:DR** The big clans win because they’re serious. You need to get serious about CW if you want to have a chance. Accept failure and adapt from it. Have fun and don’t be a dick. PM me if you need more advice.

So he loads up WOT after logging in and looks at the tech trees , but then he remembers from his basic history classes in school that the tigers were better and used pwn the Shermans .
Therefore he starts to go for Tiger H  tank , he just suicide rushes in order to get that Tiger tank and he learns nothing in the process about the game.

When he finally gets that Tiger tank he has a problem. He doesn't face M4's and T-34 but IS's, and he can even bounce the lower tiers but he doesn't know anything about angling . He still has his crew from the VK as they're at 83% and he doesn't want the % to drop when he retrains them for free. He thinks that kills are only relevant stat, so he tries to kill those 5% HP targets and he thinks that his shocking 47% win rate is  because he gets teamed up with morons and horrible teams because of his fantastic kill rate getting 1 or two kills per game . Also he starts to lose money big time as he does sweet fuck all damage ,  his conclusion is that repairing his tank is expensive, and he will save more if he hides all the time ,  disregarding the fact that you earn money by doing damage .

After 500 games of which he lost 270 (46% win rate ), so he camps even more and cowers behind the entire team , when team attacks, he stays behind so he can kill enemy tanks with less than 5% of health remaining . Of course he is never to be blamed for loosing the match, he has lots of kills , he killed two A-20 and 6% IS in his last game , and they still lost reinforcing his opinion that his teams suck and the MM hates him.
                                                                 
After a few hundred more games he gets to the E-75 and decides that with his high repair cost it's better to use the 88 as his shell costs are too high , and that there is clear bias against the Germans from the Russian developers .


Despite this he struggles on and eventually gets the E-100 
Quote

Let's examine the facts behind this: high tier tanks are expensive to repair, so I want every shot to count.  I average 6-8 shots a match, that can turn the tide for my team, but it won't dominate the game; however,  if there are 4 or 5 arty,  you are now looking at 32-40 shots per match, on 10 or 11 ""field"" opponents.  That can be as much as 4 arty rounds per opposing tank

How to fix it?  WG needs to limit the number of arty in a match to 2, then that will promote the playing of more regular tanks.  This would instantly make the game better. 

Playing arty at tier 7/8 isn't nearly as much fun as it was at lower tiers, they can bail you out of bad situations, having 4 sucks for every one.",,False,self,t5_2s113,,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1b3cfr/its_not_the_arty_killing_high_level_matches_its/

I have not posted here much before

In Patch 8.4 Wargaming will nerf the gun depression of the E-50 and E-50M from -6 degrees to something believed to be around -2 degrees.  Their reasoning for this? Because of graphic errors in which the gun clips some periscopes and so they need to reduce how much the gun depresses by so it does not clip through them.

I believe this is nonsense and many on the European forums are outraged like me.  This is the last German T10 tank that is competitive at all.  It does not need nerfed in my opinion and I seek as many of you that are willing to voice your opinions to try and change Wargamings mind.

I have put URL (I think) into the European topic so all of you can go to the forum where it has started.  On Page 4 it is confirmed by a Moderator that is on purpose and their reasons.  I do not see why it needs changed if the E-50 which has been around for years and the E-50M months functioned before perfectly fine.  I would rather the gun clip a bit and remain balanced than it nerfed so it looks 'pretty'.

Those of you not on the European servers, the harder it will be for Wargaming to ignore.

Thank you for your time and apologies for the rant.  I just feel strongly on this and I hope to find others who do too.

I understand that a losing streak is painful. I do. But now and then I see people complaining and openly believing that WG tinkers around the teams and matchmaking so that one side loses. And this is wrong idea.

 Why? Because nobody is special. If you think that a game that holds a Guinness record for the highest number of concurrent players is rigged so that you, are bound to lose then please reconsider this notion.

 Rigging a game so that MM actually selects the remaining 29 players just to get your win ratio lower seems plain impossible to execute. Because then it has to straighten up the record of the remaining 29 players using another 841 players. And then their record has to be adjusted as well

 Moreover: if 'noobs' are 'pros' used to rig your game then how come that MM never tries to adjust their win ratio? There are people with +60% and -40% win rates. Why would MM focus on one player and keep him around 50% while letting the majority just play normal

 Another issue is the shortage of unskilled players. Everybody learns. MM is bound to run out of newbies to keep dragging you down. Because they are put in your team against pros. There is a lot to learn when playing against skilled folks. And the learning is faster this way.

 One may also say that MM is not trying to destroy his stats completely, that's more reasonable.

 I wondered how would I achieve 50% WR among the players. For me

As you may or may not be aware, we are a lock for making top 30 overall. We would like to take a moment to thank all of those who helped us reach this goal.

**RDTT2:** For being on the smaller (not yet full people!) RDDT clans

**RDDT3:** We know that you guys could not participate on a regular basis

**RDDT4:** You guys were able to clear the landing zone on several nights and were invaluable in providing the intel we needed. Honestly

**RDDT5:** I know you did not work with us for the entire campaign

**RDDT6:** You guys literally came out of nowhere and did fantastic at clan wars. Really

**RDDT7:** Taking land was a huge victory for this clan

**RDDT8, we still received moral support from many of the members. Thank you for that. 

**NARWL:** We ate your land, giving QIN a run for their money in the end. I only hope we can repay this debt later in the campaign. Scratch that, we will repay it.

**RDDT** Just remember guys, we must keep our eyes on the prize. M60s are still up for grabs. 

---
Finally, working up strats, and coordinating all of the RDDT clans on the global map. I can assure you that no matter how upset you are with not making top 5, he is that much more uspet.

***

People of RDDT (and NARWL and all the other RDDT clans)

I feel like by now, I had kept my final decision to a very limited amount of people. In fact, up to that point, I had not shared my decision with any in the leadership. Like Klaus, I have decided to start a new tanking adventure, but this time with another clan. In the last few months, I have increasingly felt a need to diminish the amount of responsibility and corresponding stress that have followed me as a Deputy Commander and then as Commander of this fine clan. I want to start by making it clear that I had to make this decision at some point--this decision was coming. I finally decided late Friday night that it had to be now.

For 675 days, but rather something that I had wanted and enjoyed at the time. However, there comes to be a point when one may not want to make the final decisions anymore.

I have been incredibly taken with this clan and community. I have watched RDDT bloom from a third-rate, and prosperity of an entire armada of RDDT clans. I believe that when RDDT first took up clan wars, there maybe only three clans belonging to the RDDT name. Since then, I have been involved--in some way or another--with the creation of every other RDDT-affiliated clan.

Upon becoming the Commander of RDDT

Leaving RDDT today, subreddit, and community. I am absurdly lucky to have played such a role like I did. I have made so many friends and comrades throughout this community and especially in RDDT. I have had a brilliant experience in this clan and without it, I probably never would have stumbled onto reddit in the first place. I feel like I will leave in place a firmly established clan with a leadership structure designed to cope with even turnover like this. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly to me, the RDDT clan community now has a solid foundation for which it can find support with one another and each communicate as part of a great whole.

Truth be told, and in a great deal due to Klaus’ departure, made the most sense to finally leave. Being in a primary leadership position for as long as I did made sense as I was mainly a university student with enough time to dedicate fully to commanding RDDT. Now with my graduation and a personal desire to start freeing up more time from World of Tanks, a drastic change is needed. However, and I do hope that you understand this, is that even if I was to back off to the position of Soldier, an underlying sense of duty and protective responsibility to RDDT would prohibit me from ever being totally relaxed. I care too much about what RDDT has become to simply sit on the sidelines. Unfortunately, but it’s how I feel and because of it

Please keep in mind that I am only the third in a (hopefully) very long line of RDDT prime commanders. I feel like there is no reason for my departure to amount to anything more than a long-time member looking for a change of pace. I have always maintained, at any time, is completely welcome to leave and do what they think is best for themselves. I should hope that this same belief extends to me. I feel like there is no reason for any animosity towards me for making this personal decision, but if you feel like I’m a terrible person that’s up to you. I do hope to talk and tank with many of you in the future.

I’m certain there was so much more which I wanted to write

Have a great day everyone and

Regards

Anyways, and all the players yelling ""NO DON'T."" I don't consider my current self a great player by any means, but I'm sure I would have done better not getting the Jagdtiger early. And just as important, I'd have been having a lot more fun if I played the Jagdtiger when I understand what tanks I'm fighting at tier 8, how the flow of higher games go, etc. 

The point that I'm taking too long to get to is that I don't see too many players in my situation commenting when someone with relatively few battles asks about tier 8 prems. It's usually more experienced players either simply saying ""No, I'd like to say this from one noob to another: think about why you're getting a premium before you get it. Because getting a tier 8 before you're comfortable with tier 8, or at least tier 7 battles is not pleasant. It's not even that useful for credits if you can't perform well. And if it's for fun, there are plenty of tanks within tier 5 or 6 that aren't too hard to get to that are quite enjoyable, while still getting you out of the low tier gameplay.

The following happens 90% of the time:

Around half to a majority of tanks go valley. They go to the crest. They get shot at. They stall. If they push, the enemy push onto your cap, you lose.

Even if the tanks in valley manage to push through

1357317592.0,15yg33,PSA: End-of-game scoreboard submissions,michiganspeed,67,12,19,"Fellow Tankers

Lately we have noticed a trend where people will post an end-of-game scoreboard only to have it brutally downvoted. I just wanted to take some time and help clear things up for those who are new.

In the rules

&gt;End of game score cards are allowed but please note

In theory

No one cares when you show off the scoreboard that says that you got 8 kills. There is not a story behind this image. Sure

A much better post would be a self post that tells the story of how you got those 8 kills and adding something like a [STORY INSIDE] to your post. Context is very important when submitting content. Lets be honest here

A great example is this [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/158l4o/one_man_army_story_mode/) by reddittor /u/Mrs_Brisby.

We have added the following text in the [yellow box](http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/submit) when submitting a direct link to help clear things up:

&gt;Posting an end-of-game scoreboard? Make a text post

As always your feedback is welcome. We are not going to ban these from the subreddit outright as they are an integral part of the game and can be great tools for quickly sharing content.
