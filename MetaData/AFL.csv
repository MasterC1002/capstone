EDIT 3: Eddie McGuire was just interviewed on Triple M Football after he left the Sydney rooms and whether you like him or not, what she did was wrong and she will pay for it, but she needs to be looked out for because some not so smart people out there are going to take this one step too far. He also talked to Goods, told him not to worry about it and commended him on his performance, and said that he was planning on making the girl apologies to him in person. Good guy Ed.

I, I don't think it's appropriate. A fully grown man or woman holds their own responsibilities and if it had come from them, this would be an entirely different story. People would want blood and rightly so. But her mum/aunty/woman, that fucking stupid bitch sitting next to her, is the one that is no doubt responsible for her actions. If anyone needs to front and say sorry for anything, it's her.

Holy. Shit. This. Game. Is. Amazing.

I am exhausted so I will keep it quick

1) AFL will be in the states soon. I am bringing it there
2) I hate collingwood (although the fans were much  nicer than you all lead me to believe)
3) You Aussies are doing something right with your meat pies. 
4) Once I start following a team I think this game will give me a legitimate heart attack.

Honestly the new rules introduced, embarrassing even.


Can anyone sit down this year, not a hand or a touch. Now we are told no pushing in the front or side as well?
 

There are so many free kicks being paid now, and the constant appealing  by players every time the ball goes out of bounds is infuriating.


Another problem now is that the umpires seem to have gotten it into their oversized egos that they are somehow part of the entertainment package (which, bogan-cams, vacuous interviews, idiots loudly reminding everyone of the scores, and general commercialism that the game has embraced). Good umpiring is the kind you cannot remember after the game is finished, much less hear discussed in the media throughout the week. And what the hell is an “umpire appreciation round”? As if we all watch the game to see the fluorescent green team dominate the match with their silky hand signals and huge, manly whistles…


In my opinion, but if you look at the changes that are brought in each year to the rules then that must affect the quality of umpiring.


If you look at a lot of team-based games that are played globally like cricket, then you will find that the number of rule changes are quite minimal and certainly less than what is thrust upon the followers of AFL. It's time for the ego-trippers who run our game to quit their expansion policy and focus on what makes our game great, instead of incessantly trying to tweak some magical formula that may appeal to people to start following our game. People are more likely to take interest in the sport if the rules are easy to follow and don't change every 5 minutes, because a small panel of man have deemed it to be ""good for the game"". A lot of AFL fans have followed the game for a long time and would consider themselves knowledgeable about the game. The same lot of fans are often left in state of bewilderment and utter confusion about many decisions each week. It is patently obvious the game needs to be simplified so it is easier to officiate and also easier to follow.

Growing up in Wisconsin, Australian Football is never played here, so never got the chance.

Onto the point.  I've been watching AFL games on Fox Sports and Fox Soccer channel.  They usually only play 1 game a weeknight from 11:00pm-1:00am

I wanted to make a post and explain what I've learned about the sport as far as the laws go and see if I'm correct or not.  I've never read any lawbook, everything I 'know' has been learned strictly from watching the games and listening to the commentary.

- The quarters start with some sort of face off with the ball being spiked into the air by one of the ref's.  It's also how the game is restarted after points are scored.  I don't know what the correct term is.

- Handball passes can be made to your team

- If you kick the ball and someone on your team or the opposing team catches it

- You can run with the ball

- Points are scored by kicking the ball through the center uprights, or if it bounces through it also counts.

- I'm confused a bit about when the ball goes into touch.  It seems like as long as a player controlling the ball has at least a toe inbounds

- When a ball does go into touch

- If a player has the ball and is tackled and cannot pass the ball

- High tackles are illegal

- There doesn't seem to be any type of 'pass interference' like you'd see in American Football.  If the ball is in the air it seems like you can basically hip check your opponent to gain advantage.  I think I recall seeing blatant arm/body holding called a few times.  It also seems that jumping over the top of people to get the ball is highly encouraged and quite the talent.

- You can kick the ball whenever

 That's about it.  I love watching.  It rarely seems penalties are called and the game flows really well.   I'm trying to learn more about the clubs in general and maybe pick someone to cheer for next year.

It's been 132 days since I left Australia after a year in Melbourne on working holiday, but no. I check afl.com.au daily and I go on the ""Aussie Rules Live"" android app approx twice to three times a day to get a fix, even if it's something like the saints meeting the broncos...

The level of entertainment offered by this sport is, and it requires such amazing levels of versatility in it's atheletes. Run fast &amp; far, jump high &amp; precise, kick straight &amp; far, catch on the run, kick on the run, be quick in mind and with your hands, play hard &amp; for months and try to never lose your edge to make the top 22 every week. 

My friends over there taught me (sort-of) how to kick

Whenever I met new people and got onto the topic of footy, how I've never been interested in sports and sneered at people who's lives are engulfed by soccer (it's big in Sweden). I get them now. Now I regularly check the footy news, I've got two Sherrins, a collingwood jumper (cue downvotes) signed by a few players. I've got pie socks, t-shirts and hats. I have stickers and that book Malthouse and Buttifant wrote. My beanie is probs my most prized item, it was given to me on my first day in Oz.

I've been trying to sell the game to friends and family, which I happily told them sucks ass. And I got an iTunes voucher!

I love how the players don't make ridiculous amounts of money.
I love how it brings a city together.
I hate Geelong Fc (very nice town though).
I love how footy-concentrated Melbourne is

Anyway

Hi all

I've put together a website that you guys might be interested in. It's aimed at footy fans

http://www.hashtagfooty.com

It's mainly aimed at people like me, for example.

It's basically a way of collating and displaying tweets from footballers and clubs without the need for a twitter account. There's also a player directory which lists the details of (almost) every player on an AFL list who uses twitter

Take a look if you get a chance - And if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them..

Cheers

As promised, an increase in obvious sockpuppetry (although with few exceptions, we usually can't connect the accounts), and an increase in attempted thread derailment (continue downvoting these, please). This is mainly a rehash of [our rules](/r/afl/w/rules).

***Regarding civility:*** **please STOP personally attacking people**. We respect your right to defend/attack in the Essendon situation, etc. There have been warnings given for this recently, and this has been a bannable offence in this sub since we've had rules. Therefore, **please stop the personal attacks or more warnings/bans will be forthcoming**.

***Regarding sockpuppetry:*** we've had this issue before. I prefer that nobody does this, so don't do it.

The creation of one-off accounts to post things (then deleting said account) is befuddling, and such accounts will be banned if deemed abusive to others or excessively disruptive.

Also: whilst it's hard to prove sockpuppetry here

***Regarding thread derailment:*** the sub has been good on this, you will be banned under the No Dickheads Rule.

Before you slam me as delusional (not Dee-lusional

Throughout the 2000's, Gary Moorcroft, Chris Heffernan, Byron Pickett, Ben Holland and so forth. We did manage to pick up a few decent draft picks (Sylvia, McLean, Jones) but mostly traded for experience.

Post 2007 when we missed the final we sacked Daniher and replaced him with Bailey on a three-year contract and he was told to rebuild with youth. This, Cameron Bruce, Adem Yze, Nathan Brown, Matthew Whelan and Jeff White with Neitz having retired. Bailey recruited runners for a fast running game-plan. While this looked promising in patches (think the 67-point defeat of Sydney, 96 points over Adelaide, 60 over the Tigers, during the 3rd year of his tenure (a year which netted eight wins and a draw)

So now Neeld enters, skinny kids, in a club that he wants to be renowned for tough physical football. As a result he needs to make some huge changes, but it will have to wait close to a year as the draft is just about upon him. The standards he sets at training and the addition of Dave Misson begin to address the fitness of players, something Colin Garland has confirmed was a huge issue. He is given a license to tear apart the list, as the ""rebuild"" had simply not worked. The kicker though is that now GWS and Gold Coast have access to all the best of the young talent, and free agency loses the club Brent Moloney (although he had had questionable attitude and work ethic under Neeld) Jared Rivers (no hard feelings there) and Brad Green retires. So there we have a list being torn apart, Austin Wonneamirri

So in the face of compromised drafts, because the young players simply have to have some guidance. He also needs to bolster the playing list NOW with some people who can play a role, and he needs to add quality to the core group of young players he believes can get the team out of the giant pit they're in.

To this end, Rodan, Gillies all from Premiership winning clubs, bolsters the team in the present with M. Jones, Terlich, while also recruiting Toumpas, Viney and Hogan. He also manages to recruit Mitch Clarke the year before

A massive change in the make-up of the team puts the Dees back in my mind to the first year of the ""new game plan"" which last year was working OK by the second half of the year (albeit in a team with a forward line made up of J. Rivers and J. Howe).

Now, they stole wins over Carlton and Richmond late last year, and have comprehensively beaten Melbourne and GWS. GWS went down by 137 points yesterday - they're clearly going to take time. 

I don't see any team that has hit truly hard times in my memory that has turned it around in less than three years, this is Year 1. But there is definitely a core of players there who can turn it around, but it's going to be a while yet. I think the most important thing is that now that the Dees are on this path, everyone at the club must have the resilience to see it through, and that means backing the captaincy of Grimes, Trengove, and the coaching of Neeld

----------------

So please! Argue with me and tell me how wrong I am on every point, and Neeld should be sacked. This is the way I see it and I'd love to discuss it with anyone who can offer a differing opinion or thoughts on the whole thing.

If 70k sounds that good and creates that much atmosphere I can only imagine what it is like on grand final day or ANZAC day.

Lol at the Collingwood banner going to pieces well before the players went through it.

The kids in front of me were very funny and cute despite being raised in the black and white. Nothing funnier that seeing a little one screaming for their team and hurling G rated insults at umpires like ""booger brain!""

I think I have a man crush on Harry O now.

Thanks for helping put the purple WA Anchors in the top 4 collingwood. Maybe this will finally be their year.

The constant and loud booing Jobe got was impressive and funny. I don't think he necessarily deserves to be booed more than any other Dons player but I think it added to the atmosphere and brought the game to life even more. I wanted Jobe to get more possessions just to hear the crowd shout out.


Fuck you Wingard you fucking fuck and the pissweak fucking Crows (not that I tipped them as a result of our mammoth injury list)

Dishonourable mentions:

The smile/hug/kiss cam. My god

A big fuck you to the group of stupid, ""kill them"", ""die you bastards"" etc. real wankers. Funny juxtaposition to the sweet pies fans in front of me though. I especially liked when these Bombers fans starting yelling out that Collingwood and their fans were a bunch of ""fucking druggies"" without so much as a hint of irony.

Dishonourable mention to the train service for not running more frequent trains after a 70k match. Though still much better than SA public transport.

Major dishonourable mention for myself for enjoying a collingwood win and findig myself barracking for them. Some days I hate myself...

Fuck you Port. Fuck you to the depths of the underworld  and may Haydes make sport of your eternal suffering! :)

Well this has already been a game that's blown us away.  We're up by 6.3.33 at the final break.  Someone on the phone to his mate behind me is rather fatefully swearing there is no way back for the Dogs now, something crucially different to the games against the Saints and Hawks recently, is positive and relatively loud.  So are the Bulldogs fans although there are less of them (at least; they are more spread out where I'm sitting).  There were very clear and loud opinions on certain calls one way or the other as the game unfolded though.  

Things seemed to be going relatively steadily and as everyone expected.  We put a few goals together in this final term and the lead was bigger than it ever had been in the match.  Someone near me is planning to leave early to beat the mad rush

Then?  Then it begins.  They get one goal back.  No big deal.  Another.  Another.  Another.  What happened.  It's like the Dees had nothing left.  The crowd gets audibly, they were on the edge of their seat, silent except for the goals, when they went nuts.   

Another goal.  The Dees crowd had died down now.  We were silent.  Stunned.  Not depressed

The count up clock said 22 minutes.  This quarter had run for 22 minutes.  The goal difference, only three goals, carrrn you Dogs"".  

Boy did the Dees fans respond to that.  It's like 5 thousand pairs of eyes gunned straight for the score board, to carry on.  You better believe the referee copped it when a shocking decision handed them a goal.  A soul crushing goal.  

""Siren!"" *bang, bang, bang!* a group of boys were yelling.  In a sort of dark, self-satire of our own lack of confidence in our players.  A few other fans joined in but it didn't catch for long.  

But all throughout we were still quietly confident.  A certain suspension of disbelief made us see they needed three goals they surely can't get it.  They still need two goals

Then; suddenly

2 points.  The ball went up in the middle

Hands were on heads.  People were on their feet.  Noise was a constant peppering of yelling and cheering.  The Doggies got the absolute perfect ball out of the centre and kicked it straight into our fifty.  Everyone melted, it was like we had forgotten we were able to win little contests.  But we had.   Watts took a mark, and we acted like he scored a goal that put the result beyond doubt. 

It wasn't long after this that Sylvia was making a daring run into an attacking position, and it goes wide for a solitary, unconvincing point.  People collapse into their seats ad someone said some delightfully family unfriendly things; we were still careening from anguish to euphoria second by second, play by play.  

And that fucking siren wasn't coming.   ""This is the longest quarter of my fucking life"" I heard someone cuss.  I agreed.  

I saw in my mind a still photo of our slumping heads and jumping Footscray fans being on the front cover of a greatest wins DVD in the Dogs shop.

After an eternity though, searching handballs, handling errors, or miskicks from one team or the other.  It felt like you could have played a whole other game in the time the ball spent zooming around midfield in the dying minute.  The siren did go, though.  I am almost certain nobody expected it.  As much as we all desperately anticipated it, we had convinced ourselves it wouldn't go until we had fallen behind.  That it was destiny we would be disappointed; ruined at the death.  

Dogs fans collapsed, the team song blared over the PA system.  It took us all about 40 seconds to get in sync with the recorded voice because of the noise, and perhaps we were all rusty.  

Five renditions later

And it was like traveling through an artery.  Thousands of people snaking along to Richmond station, until I found myself sitting silently on a bus home with no hint of what had just gone on except a knowing glance between me and the older man decked out in red, white &amp; blue who got off at the same stop as me.  

I know I'll be back again.  Round 23.  That's our new grand final.  Can we double up on the Doggies?  I'll find out the hard way.

To take a few quotes from the interview as I sit here and watch it...

* ""The decision has already been made by that Melbourne Footy Club board that he will not be coaching in 2014""... 

* ""I believe Peter Jackson has already made that decision internally""... 

* ""I believe that today he is bringing forward his timeframe on that happening to Mark Neeld"" ...

* ""Peter Jackson is... not someone who is afraid to make the tough call""

* ""No reason to think they won't execute today""

* ""Don McLardy will... not be part of this regime going forward either""

He spouts about the failure of all the recruiting

As a supporter of Sydney, I can't help but feel that Essendon didn't get a fair chance.  The play-on call was correct, but if Dempsey knew there was only one second left when he took the mark, he surely would have held out for the attempt at goal.

I've heard that not having the game clock makes the game more exciting

In soccer, but rather because the game ends when when the official says it does, and he would never end the game with a scoring opportunity possible.

Shannon Hurn is the best defender in the AFL, and Ted Richards. And on that point, Colin Garland is rated higher than Sam Fisher. And all of them are rated above Dustin Fletcher.

Callan Ward is ranked higher than Andrew Swallow.

Luke Dalhaus is a better forward than Nick Riewoldt. And Rob Murphy is better forward than Taylor Walker.

EDIT:

I followed the live blog today where it was discussed and its worth noting that a lot of stats aren't used in these calculations.

The two examples given were taggers

Champion Data only just started recording 1 on 1 contests recently (a place Glass wins a lot) so the results of those aren't factored into calculations.

This is not the only way to do a ladder up however.  What if we did a ladder differently?  Why not take a look at a couple of examples and see if they make much of a difference.  

---

###FIFA  

The FIFA ladder system is also fairly straight forward but de-emphasises draws.  A win is 3 points and a draw is 1 point.  Your raw differential

This suits (soccer-)Football better because draws are fairly common and it's a low scoring game, lets take a look.  

Team|Pld|W|D|GD|Pts|
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Cats|11|10|0|294|30
Hawks|10|9|0|395|27
Swans|11|8|1|296|25

###Super 15's  

The Rugby ladder is an interesting one.  In this case, but also rewarded an extra ladder point in two scenario's.  Either scoring 4 tries in the match, or losing by less than 7 points (one converted try).  For this ladder, I have decided that the equivalents in AFL would be achieving 100 points in a game, or losing by less than 12 points.  They also, like other codes, prefer raw F/A over the percentage calculation.  Lets see what happens.  

Team|Pld|W|D|Bonus|GD|Pts|
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Cats|11|10|0|10|294|50
Hawks|10|9|0|8|395|44
Swans|11|8|1|8|296|42
Bombers|11|8|0|6|261|38
Dockers|10|7|1|5|180|35
Magpies|11|7|0|7|56|35
Blues|11|6|0|10|190|34
Eagles|11|6|0|5|148|29
Tigers|10|6|0|5|97|29
Crows|11|5|0|7|76|27
Power|10|5|0|6|61|26
*Kangaroos*|11|4|0|9|115|25
*Suns*|11|5|0|3|-40|23
Bulldogs|10|3|0|2|-238|14
Lions|10|3|0|1|-258|13
Saints|11|2|0|3|-149|11
Demons|11|1|0|1|-731|5
Giants|11|0|0|2|-753|2  

Italic'd is the only positioning change on this ladder.  The 'Roos terrible record in close games is somewhat forgiven in their continual receipt of bonus points.  

Not immediately obvious, while in the actual ladder, Hawthorns great percentage would probably ensure they take the top position.  

Loss consolation and 100 point bonus encourage two things.  Competitive and attacking rugby.  I quite imagine the process would be the same in AFL and many of these games would have been very different.  Port Adelaide and Carlton are separated by just 4 points and 13% in reality, and record of attacking, high scoring games has put them 8 points ahead, or two wins.   

I like this ladder system.  I'm not saying we should adopt it necessarily, or the 'draws are a slow death' system that FIFA has in place are interesting options as well.  They make the final moments of games that much more important, that much more stressful, because there is no consolation, and North are punished much more harshly for their failure to kick just one more goal so often.

They're covering Buddy Franklin every single week. Let the guy play and get on with it. Report something when something actually happens. They did the same with Cloke last year.

Essendon captain Jobe Watson said he and his players felt “vindicated” by that statement. 

But ASADA has told the Herald Sun the investigation continues; and the possibility of future charges remains. 

“Given this investigation is ongoing,” an ASADA spokesman said. 

“Should ASADA form the view at the conclusion of its investigation that a person may have committed an anti-doping rule violation ASADA will follow its established process”.

It is not up to the AFL to initiate doping charges against players.
