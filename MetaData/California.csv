&gt;Dear beefanator0:
 
&gt;Thank you for writing to express your opposition to the ""Cybersecurity &gt;Act of 2012"" (S. 2105).  I appreciate your taking the time to write and &gt;welcome the opportunity to share my perspective.
 
&gt;On February 14, and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator John Rockefeller (D-WV) and I cosponsored, the ""Cybersecurity Act of 2012"" (S. 2105).  This bill would, among other things, help secure the computer systems that control our most critical infrastructure.  Under the bill, ""critical infrastructure"" is defined narrowly to include systems that if attacked would cause mass casualties, the collapse of financial markets, the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for consideration. 
 
&gt;Please note that the bill does not attempt to regulate the Internet and it does not contain a ""kill switch."" 
 
&gt;I am deeply concerned by the significant and growing threat cyber intrusion poses to our national security, cyber attackers hack into individuals' computers, accessing private information, and using the computers to launch other attacks.  These cyber intrusions affect the United States in substantial and real ways, and the threat is only growing. 
 
&gt;As legislation is drafted to address these concerns, and limitations on government and the private sector in protecting computer networks and critical infrastructure, and we worked closely with privacy and civil liberty groups as the legislation was developed.  I strongly believe, however, that improved security must balance the privacy and the civil liberties of all Americans and remain consistent with applicable law.

She never once has a reference to privacy

1350317197.0,11ilet,Some brief thoughts on the 2012 California Propositions.  Anybody else?,SheilasFriend,88,15,238,"I put together some notes on the various propositions facing California voters this November.  Here they are:

Prop 30 – Increases sails tax and increases Personal Income Tax for people with annual income of $450

Prop 31 – California Government Performance and Accountability – Not real reform

Prop 32 – Prohibits Unions from using payroll deductions.  Anti-union – pro PAC.  My vote – No.

Prop 33 – Allows Auto Insurance Companies to reduce premiums for people who have continuous coverage.  Pro Auto Insurance Industry and funded by them.  There is an exception for military but not students or people who just don’t need a car for extended periods of time.  My vote – NO.  Note

Prop 34 – Abolish death penalty.  I am not anti-death penalty

Prop 35 – Anti human trafficking.  Not funded – Has broad definition of pimping.  For example the law would define Commercial Sex Acts as “any sexual conduct on account of which anything of value is given or received by any person.”  Another quote from the voter’s guide, roommates, domestic partners, and landlords of prostitutes to be labeled as sex offenders.  The real goal is to gain access to asset forfeiture to benefit the endorsing law enforcement agencies and non-profits.  Proposition 35 has no oversight or accountability. This will open the door to corrupt practices we’ve seen before in drug enforcement.”   I don’t like this one – My vote – NO

Prop 36 – Liberalizes Three Strikes law if third felony is not serious or violent – I have always thought that the three strikes law was too restrictive – My vote – YES (corrected) – But I could be convinced otherwise.

Prop 37 – Genetically engineered food labeling.  Why not? – Why doesn’t the food industry want us to know?  My vote – Yes

Prop 38 – Increases everyone’s Personal Income Tax

Prop 39 – Tax corporations based on the California sales – seems like a no brainer and brings in more revenue for California.  My vote – Yes

Prop 40 - Nullify the California State Senate redistricting plan approved by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission.  Courts have already done this.  Is there still a reason to vote on it?

Edit:  I am voting Yes on 36.  My original comments had No by mistake.",self,t5_2qhsz,1350332114.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/11ilet/some_brief_thoughts_on_the_2012_california/

I have gotten no response since, CA. She first left home in February, but she kept in weekly contact with me via text message. She wouldn't tell me exactly where she was living, but she made reference to the San Diego, CA area. She just told me that she was staying with a friend. Since then, I'm not sure if she has moved or even if she has a place to stay or if she has a job. She graduated from a 6 week nursing course before she left home in January (but I'm not sure of what her certification was). I have contacted ALL of her friends that she may have talked to, but nobody has heard anything at all in over 2 months. Her little 5 year old daughter hasn't seen her mom in months. I filed a police report, but I just want to know that she's okay and I was hoping I could ask everyone to just take one moment to look at her photos. My sister and I haven't been ""close"" (meaning 'best friend' type relationship) since we were kids

tl;dr My 26 year old sister disappeared off of the face of the planet. Do you recognize her? Please tell me that she's okay.




Edit: For those that would be more comfortable speaking to a police officer






EDIT: 

hey all


i really appreciate everyone’s prayers and efforts to put the word out to find my sister. i spoke with a detective at the Corona police department, no matter how selfish, foolish, and inconsiderate it is. she has completely changed her lifestyle, and at this time wants nothing to do with her former life.. while i can say that i've been able to find out a lot about her activities and whereabouts, she's not in a ""safe"" place so to speak, but she is making a conscious decision to live this way.. it would have been nice of her to at least say a simple fuck you so as to leave nobody worried about her whereabouts, i respect her choice to live that way, and for understanding that the reasons i had to be alarmed were legitimate.. may the flying spaghetti monster be with you all. :o)",t5_2qhsz

I recently went on a road trip

This is where you come in.  Perhaps you would be willing to get it

So where exactly is this sweater of mine?  I'll tell you.  If you head West out of Lompoc along West ocean Ave (HWY 246) and continue along Lassale Canyon Rd

At this point you should be going into Ocean Beach Park

This is where it gets a bit tricky.  You will come to a set of railway tracks - DO NOT CROSS THEM! - Instead

You are almost there my valiant hero.  You should see a point where the road gets too over grown to continue.  This is where I chose to make camp.  This is where my sweater now lies.

You will see it to your left - Possibly hanging from the old decrepite fence - but more likely fallen

The sweater is Grey wool, this is where my sweater now dwells.  Please my champion!  If you choose to accept this quest, and succeed - my gratitude will be unwavering.

1351380969.0,12718l,Can anyone answer these questions about Prop 35 (Human Sex Trafficking)? I'm trying to make an informed vote.,AccountCreated4This,44,6,22,"[Link to Ballotpedia on Prop 35](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_35

1) It's said that Prop 35 will broaden the definition of trafficking to ""include the production or distribution of child pornography."" I did not see this in the proposition language itself unless it is a tangential reference to a pre-existing penal code statute referenced only by number. Can someone point to me where in the proposition language this would be?

This concerns me because I think we should use the tools we have to exact justice and not try to rope people in under duplicate or unrelated laws. Like if someone has a CP image of a child for sale for sex trafficking (buy this kid, then later gets caught for his CP - I want that person prosecuted for having CP under all applicable CP laws, but that person does not seem to be involved at all in sex trafficking other than in the most tangential way. It seems like it would be hard to draw a line, so would all CP now be ""sex trafficking""? I just want to see proper justice administered and not just label everything ""sex trafficking,"" which will only diminish the meaning of when REAL sex trafficking occurs.

2) The erotic service providers claim that if they're somehow roped into this and labelled traffickers, their children for college, could also be tried as a trafficker. Where is the language in the proposition that would allow that to happen? Are erotic service providers really at risk for being roped in as traffickers under this proposition? I just don't see it in the changes to the penal code, but maybe I'm missing something.

3) The whole idea of now requiring EVERYONE on the sex offender registry, a condition of release/parole/probation/whatever would either be to stay off the internet or possibly surrender your internet info to the authorities if you're going to use the internet. Is there any evidence that these people are re-offending and possibly breaking the terms of their probation by attempting to commit more sex crimes via the internet to the degree that ALL sex offenders should now have to register?

Don't get me wrong - I'm not into protecting sex offenders anymore than a civilized society should under our Constitution, and then some parole officer sees someone else named ""CarLover100"" on reddit - are they then going to hassle the sex offender about whether that is an online alias of his he failed to report? Are they going to subpoena info on the unrelated user of that login? What is the point to any of this? It seems like a monumental waste of time in a world where everyone uses the internet, instead of focusing on those already sex offenders known to use the internet to commit sex crimes, or focusing on those people using the internet for sex crimes that haven't been caught yet.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide me in answering my questions.

**EDIT:**

After not getting any helpful replies (not blaming anyone for that)

Here is what I found and the conclusions I reached. Maybe it will be of help to people to understand this proposition a little better

As I guessed up above

* 266 – Prostitution of minor females
* 266h – People who derive money from prostitution
* 266i – Pimping/pandering
* NEW 266j – Giving or transporting a child for any lewd or lascivious act
* 267 – Taking away a child from a legal guardian for prostitution
* NEW 311.1 – Child porn
* NEW 311.2 – Any obscene matter
* NEW 311.3 – Sexual exploitation aka pictures of children engaged in sexual acts
* 311.4 – Hiring a minor for obscene matter
* NEW 311.5 – Writing/promoting obscene material
* NEW 311.6 – Promotion of obscene live events
* 518 – Extortion

Old Penalty:

* Adult - imprisonment in the state prison for three

* Minor - imprisonment in the state prison for four

New Penalty:

* Adults - imprisonment in the state prison for 8,000).

* Minors - imprisonment in the state prison as follows:
(1) Five,000).
(2) Fifteen years to life and a fine of not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace

The current law basically included general human trafficking and sex slave trafficking in the same subsection. The revision breaks human trafficking into two parts – one for general human trafficking (I would assume something like classic slave work – perhaps farm workers or even some of those horror nanny stories you hear about). The second part is for the sex slave trade. As you can see above, there have to be some scummy services that send you child porn that is of the sex slave you’d eventually get or spend time with or whatever. That kind of stuff definitely keeps the sex trade going.

For all of those sections, the prosecutor will have to prove the person with the CP obtained it in furtherance of the sex slave industry, and not just because its CP in general. Otherwise, if its just someone with CP, they're just prosecuted for CP like normal.

The penalty for minors is a little confusing because by definition of “deprivation of personal liberty, etc. That’s the one area of the trafficking portions that seems to be poorly written and/or implemented.

The consent and mistake of age seem like they’re pretty common bar’s to defenses of sexual misconduct in criminal law. In California “She said she was 18” isn't a valid defense for statutory rape if she was 14 or younger (otherwise I guess mistake of fact MIGHT work as a defense if she was 15-17). This is obviously broader. Might an erotic services industry accidentally employ an underage girl? Yes. But for them to get hit with these trafficking laws, they've already been subject to the current law.

I support the changes to the evidence code too

I really have to wonder how many individuals or newspapers went into that kind of detail to really look at the law

I still stand by the idea that requiring all sex offenders to register their internet information is a little absurd. Had that part not been present, plus the fact these reforms should be able to be passed legislatively and not by proposition, means I’ll lean toward NO on this proposition.

**tl;dr - The erotic services industry seems to be full of it with their opposition to this as they are already subject to the current law, there doesn't appear to be good reason to require EACH AND EVERY sex offender to register their internet information with the government. This has me personally leaning toward a NO vote.**",,False,self,t5_2qhsz,1351414813.0,,

They told her that she has come home too late and they don't like it that she has a friend in her room (me)(I've never been in there for longer than 3 hours during the day/evening). The catch? There was no warning. No rules written on the contract. They will give her the rest of the months pay and deposit back but want her out today. Is this legal? I have read that she should get either (a) three days written notice if she has done illegal activity. She hasn't. Or (b) 30 day written notice to evict. 

This is from the handbook: However

She is a single lodger. Is this saying that a single lodger (tenant renting a room from a home owner) can be kicked out any time?? Why? Please help.


Edit:
Also who can we contact if we want to takes some sort of action? Police?



*** ok thanks guys for your help. I know now that rules change by city. Also that a 30 days should be required. Thanks for all your help.


Update!! So she found another room. We made sure to know the rules of the house. She won't be able to move into the new room until tomorrow so she went back to the current room and they told she can't stay. They said by her packing her things that was taken as an agreement? That she is leaving. This kinda stumped me. Whatever. She is staying one night at my house. Thanks for all you input.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 10 years now

I would like for her to receive a postcard from all the places we've visited together these past years. Each postcard would have just one letter in it

I already enlisted [/r/England](http://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/1i2wph/hi_rengland_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with_a/) and [/r/Unitedkingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1i31ry/hi_runitedkingdom_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help/). Going through the different regions where I need postcards from while trying to avoid reddit spam filter for multiposting. 

While I would like to repay for the postcard and the stamp

We've travelled quite a bit over the years so if you happen to be in any of these other cities and would be up to give me a hand I would be really thankful.

Cheers

THE LOS ANGELES TIMES HAS AN ARTICLE ON THE SUBJECT:

HUGE California Traffic Tickets Fines Effective 01/06/2011 
 
Please be extremely careful in your driving and car registration &amp; insurance matters.  State of California is broke and they are trying hard to squeeze all of us hard to collect money.  

Effective immediately, you will be charged $616.  The state of California is going for blood, so be extra careful in driving, You cannot afford messing with them.  I have been hearing that Highway Patrols are under pressure to issue a lot more tickets than last year with at least 30% increase in fines over 2009, so beware of radar guns, highway and traffic cameras installed everywhere and the tougher enforcement of parking rules. 
Just for your info, you will be looking at almost $ 1000 in parking tickets , so it'd better be worth it.

1374166945.0,1ikih4,Dianne Feinstein's response to an email regarding the NSA,parineum,33,6,15,"I sent Dianne Feinstein an email some time ago regarding the NSA. I'm not sure when

&gt;I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond. 

 

&gt;First, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.

 

&gt;As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights.

 

&gt;These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming.

 

&gt;* On June 18

 

&gt;* While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified

 

&gt;* Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates. 

 

&gt;* Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based Najibullah Zazi.  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks. Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested. Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system. 

 

&gt;* Regarding terrorist David Headley, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed

 

&gt;Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans. 

 

&gt;The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House. 

 

&gt;Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity

 

&gt;Again, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.

Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition to the ""Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act

 

The ""PROTECT IP Act"" (S. 968) gives copyright and trademark owners and the U.S. Department of Justice authority to take action against websites ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are websites that have ""no significant use other than engaging in, the sale of goods with a counterfeit trademark, or the evasion of technological measures designed to protect against copying.  I'm sorry to say that theft of intellectual property is a major problem and has primarily adversely affected the American motion picture industry. 

 

I voted for the ""PROTECT IP Act"" when it came before the Senate Judiciary Committee

 

First, I raised concerns about the website blocking provision.  I was pleased Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced this provision would be removed from the bill.  I was also concerned that the overbroad language of the bill could encompass non-pirate websites and filed an amendment to fix this problem.  Finally, I worked to alleviate undue burdens on Internet advertising services and to minimize the risk of litigation on growing technology businesses.

 

On May 26, 2012, that he was postponing a procedural vote on this bill.  I believe postponing this vote was the right thing to do.  In order to move forward, the bill must be changed to prevent it from harming legitimate businesses and Internet users in the process of protecting copyrights and trademarks.  In other words, the bill must be fair and balanced.

 

In mid-January, high-tech and my colleagues – to produce a fair and balanced bill. 

 

As you may be aware, in the House of Representatives.  Please know I will keep your thoughts in mind should the Senate proceed to a vote on either of these bills. 

 

Once again, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.  


          Wishing you a happy 2012.

Sincerely yours


  Dianne Feinstein

1286309614.0,dn91q,This year's Propositions,Mookie5,32,7,47,"I just went through my voter's guide and got started on digesting this year's round of propositions. Let's discuss them! I've cut and pasted the generic descriptions of each one below:

19: LEGALIZES MARIJUANA UNDER CALIFORNIA BUT NOT FEDERAL LAW. PERMITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REGULATE AND TAX COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION, cultivate, or transport marijuana for personal use. Fiscal Impact: Depending on federal, state, and local government actions, potential increased tax and fee revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually and potential correctional savings of several tens of millions of dollars annually.

20: REDISTRICTING OF CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Removes elected representatives from process of establishing congressional districts and transfers that authority to recently-authorized 14-member redistricting commission comprised of Democrats

21: ESTABLISHES $18 ANNUAL VEHICLE LICENSE SURCHARGE TO HELP FUND STATE PARKS AND WILDLIFE PROGRAMS. GRANTS SURCHARGED VEHICLES FREE ADMISSION TO ALL STATE PARKS. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Exempts commercial vehicles


22: PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM BORROWING OR TAKING FUNDS USED FOR TRANSPORTATION, even during severe fiscal hardship, from delaying distribution of tax revenues for these purposes. Fiscal Impact: Decreased state General Fund spending and/or increased state revenues, probably in the range of $1 billion to several billions of dollars annually. Comparable increases in funding for state and local transportation programs and local redevelopment.

23: SUSPENDS IMPLEMENTATION OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROL LAW (AB 32) REQUIRING MAJOR SOURCES OF EMISSIONS TO REPORT AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING

24: REPEALS RECENT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO LOWER THEIR TAX LIABILITY. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Fiscal Impact: Increased state revenues of about $1.3 billion each year by 2012–13 from higher taxes paid by some businesses. Smaller increases in 2010–11 and 2011–12.

25: CHANGES LEGISLATIVE VOTE REQUIREMENT TO PASS BUDGET AND BUDGET-RELATED LEGISLATION FROM TWO-THIRDS TO A SIMPLE MAJORITY. RETAINS TWO-THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR TAXES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Legislature permanently forfeits daily salary and expenses until budget bill passes. Fiscal Impact: In some years

26: REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL FEES BE APPROVED BY TWO-THIRDS VOTE. FEES INCLUDE THOSE THAT ADDRESS ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SOCIETY OR THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSED BY THE FEE-PAYER'S BUSINESS. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Fiscal Impact: Depending on decisions by governing bodies and voters

27: ELIMINATES STATE COMMISSION ON REDISTRICTING. CONSOLIDATES AUTHORITY FOR REDISTRICTING WITH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STATUTE. - Eliminates 14-member redistricting commission. Consolidates authority for establishing state Assembly

I'll put my initial thoughts in the comments.

So do you really want to make a change? Do you really want to make a difference? Call your representatives/senators! Tell them to move forward with this legislation! Let them know that the people who are voting them into office are also the ones who want them to support this bill! We can do this like we did with SOPA and PIPA. It only took a day for that.

GF Information:  







She is a resident of the state of CA; county/city Los Angeles. She is a bartender who has been working for this current employer















The Bar information/misdeeds:  







- The employees are paid on ""per shift"" basis. Shift pay (at least for my GF, 6p-2a on weekends, however, employees are asked to report to work 30min before the ""start"" of their shift (as ""bar time"" is 15 minutes fast; this allows them to arrive 15 minutes early to change over shift), and employees are required to stay past 2a (bar closing) to close out their register, clean, etc.







- ...continued from above: employees do not clock in/out.  







- ... continued from above: taxes are withheld from my GF's paycheck; she is not an independent contractor; I am not aware of the forms she signed when beginning employment















- Employees are not afforded any meal break. As I understand it







- ...continued from above: as I understand the law, there is no ""hourly rate"" on her paycheck, but assuming minimum wage [$8] and assuming she has worked an average of 4 shifts/week for the last 52 weeks, this would entitle her to &gt;$1500)  















- There are NO labor regulations/minimum wage notifications/etc. posted at her place of work















- Employees are (semi-)regularly required to attend mandatory meetings that are unpaid. These meetings have ranged anywhere from 1hr to 3hrs.  















- The Bar has remained open for the last 4+ weeks despite undergoing renovations to the interior







- Important to note on above: not only are drinks served (and obviously, and food is routinely brought in/sold/consumed in The Bar.  















- Occasionally, but as I understand it, open food ""bars"" aren't allowed in CA bars/nightclubs.

I don't want to be too isolated, but I don't want to be paying any more than I have to, or for that matter, asking my cousin to foot the bill on a place that's any more expensive than necessary. 


-Things to avoid? Areas of California to avoid in general? My city is small(16th largest in the states


-Weird laws


-How do I go about getting legal residence once I'm there? How do I transfer all of my information after I've been out there a bit? I know I'd need a new driver's license


-Is this even possible or am I reaching for stars? Is it economically feasible right now
