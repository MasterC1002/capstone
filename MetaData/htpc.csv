.

As many of you know, though even newer phones like the SGS3 have the capability too. The current buzzword surrounding NFC is Google Wallet. This is a service that ties into your credit and debit cards as well as rewards and prepaid cards. Together with NFC, it allows you to use your phone like a credit card anywhere NFC payment systems are in place.

.


However, what a lot of people were wanting to know more about was how I set up my home theater to be fully automated through NFC.

.

___________________________________________

.

Essentially, I can hear the show on the TV. In reverse, I also have an NFC sticker on the interior of my front door that when scanned, will make sure everything is shut down if it isn't already. This exact functionality is mirrored in the bedroom to turn on that television. However, since I use an Xbox 360 as an extender, I do not have it tune to my favorite channel and it takes a minute or so for TV to start playing.

.

To do this

* Home Theater PC (or regular PC)
* Android device with NFC (Galaxy Nexus)
* [EventGhost](http://www.eventghost.org/) application running on HTPC
* [Tasker Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.)
* [Terremote Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eventghostremote.christophergertz.de&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImV2ZW50Z2hvc3RyZW1vdGUuY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJnZXJ0ei5kZSJd) (Remote Control)
* NFC Stickers (Mine are from TagStand)
* [NFC Task Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qd3NvZnQubmZjYWN0aW9ubGF1bmNoZXIiXQ..)
* [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com/) IR Receiver/Transmitter (For controlling TVs and external equipment)

.

**PC SETUP**

.

The first step is to prepare the PC you will be using to control the actual home theater components. I use a dedicated HTPC running Windows Media Center. However, it is exactly that. It allows you to perform tasks, macros, or other events based on incoming events. And like Tasker, there are several plugins you can enable to expand functionality. For instance, there is a plugin specific to Onkyo receivers connected through a serial port. I won't get into how you set up EventGhost in here, though if you have a few questions, you will need to enable the **Network Event Receiver** plugin. This is what will allow you to receive commands from your the Terremote remote app. Make note of the port and password on this page. Additionally

.

**ANDROID REMOTE SETUP**

.

Once we have this basic setup in place, give it a name, and use the local IP address of the PC running EventGhost. The port and password are the same as what's displayed in the Network Event Receiver plugin. Hit save and you will be ready to test out a remote button. Go back to the app and hit menu, Edit Mode. Hit menu again and this time select Add Button. Once you position it to where you want, its property box will open. Mess with whatever you want but the key is in the **Action on click** section. Make sure the type is Network Event and then give it an event name. This name will be what's displayed in the EventGhost log and will be the unique identifier for that button. For instance, a power button could have the event name of: **android.power**

.

Save this button, you will need a compatible IR transmitter. I use [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com/) as it seems to be the best and most supported. Once you have added the button event to a task, you are now able to test it through the terremote app and make sure it does what you want. For instance, a power button should send an IR command to your LCD to turn it on and off.

.

**TASKER SETUP**

.

The next thing to do is set up [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.). Tasker is the handshake between receiving the NFC signal and action through the PC. Open up Tasker and switch to the **Tasks** tab at the top (default view is Profiles). Add a new task

.

The only settings you need to worry about for the HTTP Get is **Server:Port** and **Path**. Here is an example of what it should look like: [HTTP Get Settings](http://i.imgur.com/R6ROJ.jpg). The Server:Port box MUST adhere to this naming convention:

    user:password@IPaddress:port

Obviously, IPaddress, and port with the actual information from the plugin settings. Again, the IP address is the local IP of the PC running EventGhost. The Path can be anything you want it to be and is the name that will display in EventGhost's log, the only requirement is it needs to be preceded by a question mark. Just make it unique. Save these settings and add a new action. This time select App and then Load App. It will show a list of all installed apps--simply select Terremote. You can keep these settings the same. Save this action and then save the task. You may test this task and it should send an event to the EventGhost log and open Terremote. Add the event to a macro in EventGhost to turn on your TV and you are ready for the next step!

.

**NFC SETUP**

.

You're now ready for the fun part, select **Done** and then tap your phone to the NFC sticker until it alerts you that it wrote successfully. You can now test this by tapping your phone to the same tag which should now launch the associated NFC Task Launcher command. If all things are set up correctly, Tasker should send a command to EventGhost to turn on your TV and load Terremote on your device.

.

_________________________

.

This is the basic setup for turning your Android device into a full-fledged NFC home automator. Experimenting with what you can control in EventGhost and Tasker, but I have it tune into my favorite channel. This *favorite* channel is dependent on the day of the week and the time of the day.

.

A few people have asked why I don't just have this set based on location in Tasker. The reason I use NFC instead is so that I still have to manually initiate the action. Not every time I get home do I want the TV on. This way it only turns on when I actually want to watch something.

I'm posting an update to [my unRAID server build](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/o0iht/unraid_12tb_file_server_build/). I made my initial build in 2010. The reasons for upgrading were to add hot swap cages (also increasing max drives from 12 to 15)

I decided to go with the Intel Xeon E3-1230v2 since it the cheapest single node Xeon CPU with hyper-threading. I know that I could probably get away with just an i3 but I wanted the flexibility of transcoding to multiple Plex clients and well as the option to move to ESXi in the future. The idle power consumption is still very good on this CPU and it's worth the extra $100 to know that the CPU won't choke during transcoding.

Having gone from a 3Mbps DSL connection to a 150Mbps FIOS connection

The build price below is without the hard drives included. Prices of the hard drives has vary as I've purchased them over the past few years. I've taken all the 1TB and 500GB drives out of the array. It is now made up of:

* 7 x 2TB and 2 x 3TB Data Drives
* 1x 3TB Parity Drive
* 1x 3TB Warm Spare
* 1x 500GB Cache Drive

20TB of total data storage with another 3TB waiting as a warm spare for a failed drive or additional storage if needed.

All the smaller drives are being moved over to my new backup server. I was able to pickup a Rosewill Challenger case for $39 and a Corsair CX430 for $16 to make the cheap second server. The Supermicro AOC-SASLP-MV8 is going to replaced later this week with an IBM Serveraid M1015 flash to IT mode. This new SAS card has about 4x the total throughput. My current AOC-SASLP-MV8 will be totally saturated when I have 8 drives on the controller. The M1015 will be nice if I make the decision to move to ESXi and virtualize my unRAID setup in the future.

My first ""HTPC"" was an original XBOX running XBMC
My second HTPC was a purpose built computer based on an AMD mini-atx mobo in an Antec Fusion case. For storage I had 2 750GB drives in striped with a single 80GB drive for OS. I tried a number of different DVR software packages and after a few months running BeyondTV on XP64, video and audio drivers were frequently messing with the onboard video's ability to provide deinterlacing and accelerated decoding as well as stable multichannel spdif output.
I eventually updated to windows 7 and a ceton inifinitv cablecard tuner

So

* [HD-Plex fanless case](http://www.hd-plex.com/hdplex-h5.todd-fanless-computer-case.html)
* [ASUS F2A85-M Pro microATX FM2 Motherboard](http://www.silentpcreview.com/ASUS_F2A85-M_Pro)

* [Pulse-Eight usb-hdmi-cec adaptor](http://www.pulse-eight.com/store/products/104-usb-hdmi-cec-adapter.aspx)

Build Notes:

* I had misread the specs on the case and thought it would fit 2x3.5"" drives and a 2.5"" drive
* The case could probably accommodate 5x2.5"" and is setup with standoffs and through holes for 3x2.5""
* The heatpipe assembly to connect the case's side panel to the cpu was a little fidgety to get together and required a bit more force than I would have liked. That said
* The case doesn't come with the flexible pci-e riser which is needed to mount any accessory cards
* The full length ceton tuner card fits fine in the case
* I had seen pictures of a 120mm fan mounted in the bottom, so.....
* The stock fan from the APU heatsink does fit under the expansion card once I redrilled the 3.5"" mounts to move the drive forward in the case. IMHO the revised location should be where it is from the factory and would allow for a second 3.5 drive to fit more rearward in the case that you don't need a fan.
* The stock fan from the APU is virtually silent when run at 850RPM
* The slimline bluray drive with mounting try just BARELY clears the picoPSU and makes a serious racket when reading data disks. However when playing a bluray movie the drive makes no noticeable noise at normal listening volumes; except for some spin seek noise when restarting after a long pause (bathroom break).
* With the ASUS board and the provided USB 3 internal cable it is not possible to connect the front panel usb3 port AND have the slimline drive since the cord and mount both want to occupy the same space.
* The HDMI detective was bought on a whim since I sometimes have problems with the PC changing video settings depending whether the AVR or TV powers on first and which device completes HDMI handshake. The box is brilliant! Setup was simple and my AVR and HTPC stay sync'd without audio hiccups after pausing as well as having solved the handhake/settings interaction. This may be achievable through clever software config
* The HDMI-CEC adaptor is similarly brilliant

Software Notes:

* Since the last time I did a bare install support for bitstreaming audio has gotten way way way simpler. Installing LAV filters and running a small registry modification is all it takes to be able to get mkv splitting for all my ripped HD-DVD movies (I forgot to mention my old HTPC had a HD-DVD/BluRay combo drive :) ) and i get dd+
* Since the last time I did blah blah blah
* LAV filter also handles doing video decoding using the ATI GPU's DXVA2 and apparently also works with nvidia's solution as well (I've not tried nvidia though).
* When moving the Ceton card with cablecard between PCs there is no need to reactivate/pair the cable card. However all my recordings from premium channels on my old PC were flagged with copy-once drm and cannot be view on the machine. Recordings that weren't marked copy-once can be imported by browsing to them in the new WMC7 instance and selecting ""copy"" from the action menu. Sometime I had to attempt the copy more than once since the DRM operation is apparently finicky.
* If you have Haali splitter or ffd show installed on windows 7
* Arcsoft Total Media Theater is still really awesome for playing back blurays, only watch the main feature with the prefered audio track.
* [Ceton's mediacenter companion app](http://cetoncorp.com/products/companion/) for IOS is super duper cool


At any rate, 2TB 2.5"" drives have to be coming soon and this case could hold plenty of those.

On one hand, and use my machine like a PC if I want to, but still maintain an appliance like functionality through the Metro UI and having XBMC installed etc. I've even seen some people post write ups about having their W8 box boot right into XBMC instead of to Metro.

Some things that I learned:

* The Silverstone Grandia GD05B is better than the GD04B (looks the same except front panel is all aluminum) if you aren't planning on having an optical drive.  
* The case is tight
* Cooling is great with the case and gives you room to add more fans or a closed liquid system like the H60.  Will take most aftermarket CPU coolers.  
* An SSD is much faster than a HDD
* For the Crucial M4 SSD
* Storage fills up quickly for a 2TB HDD

**UPDATE!!!!**

FYI I have learned the we should refer to the unit as the MK808..even though there are at least 4 different versions of this thing out there. I own an ""Original"" MK808

Here is the unboxing http://imgur.com/a/l5fzn

The unit is VERY small and very light.  To be honest when I finally held it in my hand I thought I had been scammed because it doesn't seem that something so small could really work well.  It does!

It comes with all the cables you need to hook it up

Out of the box I plugged a hard wired mouse in to the unit. that worked without an issue.  After I had configured it I switched to a Logitech MX Air Rechargeable Cordless Mouse http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Air-Rechargeable-Cordless-Mouse/dp/B000T8CWFE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368189225&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+air+mouse 
There was no configuration

It comes with Android 4.1.1 loaded http://i.imgur.com/pQbydfx.png and a ton of Chinese Only apps preinstalled.  To be honest it worried me to have all these apps on it that I have no idea what they do so within 10 mins of playing with it I decided to root it. One of the main reasons why I waned to root is you cant turn the sucker off with the stock image without unplugging it. So I quickly found some simple instructions with a very good ROM for all four different versions of the MK808.  This is where knowing what version of the MK808 is important. Root is super easy because the unit is not locked. Really all you are doing is getting the unit in to Flash Mode so you can flash a new ROM. 

Here is all four ROMs with all the tools you need (This ROM is refered to as Finless) http://www.freaktab.com/showthread.php?3857-NEW-MK808-quot-all-models-quot-Finless-1-7 

And here is a video walking you through flashing the ROM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n63W2zustS8 

It is really easy to do.  My unit has the hidden button that puts the the unit in to flash mode

So once I got the new ROM loaded it was MUCH faster and all the little options like a power button and hiding the status bar were all there. I installed BubbleUPnP

What I discovered is that *some* computers support power on/off commands through USB. This is dependent on the motherboard though

I searched through a lot of information, but would rather not spend a lot of time and mental energy frustrating myself. I spent endless hours searching forums.

The two solutions I eventually tried:

[HDPLEX](http://www.hd-plex.com/remote.control.html)
I tried this solution first. TBH, but gave up hastily because I found the second option.

[SIMEREC](http://www.simerec.com/PCS-2.html) This worked! The instructions are great, where the one button both powers the computer on and off. The kit was complete and instructions easy to follow. No soldering involved (which SIMEREC necessitated), which was a plus. The system basically interjects itself into the line to the power button on the front of the case, and requires you to splice into a power line from the power supply (see their PDF instructions online). I also had to drill a hole in the front of my case. These were all relatively painless modifications in my mind.

1360094876.0,17y974,For your HTPC consideration: The ZOTAC ID61,shadowcman,18,3,14,"It seems like the general consensus here is that custom building an HTPC is the way to go since you get the most bang for your buck. The problem is I wanted something small and quiet that looked attractive sitting in my living room next to my TV. This is one of the most important features for me and what ultimately took building a custom PC out of the running. I had already done a lot of research into building my own PC and picked out the following components:

* Processor: AMD-A10 5700
* Motherboard: MSI Mini ITX Socket FM2
* RAM: 2x2GB
* Hard Drive: Crucial m4 64GB SSD

These specs would have been more than enough to accomplish the tasks of playing 1080p videos with XBMC, and serving media to my Xbox 360 and Nexus 10.

The component that I spent the most time searching for was the case. The smallest case that I could find that could house the parts I wanted while still being attractive was the [E-i5 case](http://www.ecosmartpc.com/ei5.html) with the 84W PSU from ecosmartpc.com ($114.98 shipped).  This would have suited my needs but I’d only rate the design a 7.5/10 and it’s also quite expensive.  I also looked at the [Wesena ITX2-B](http://www.shop.perfecthometheater.com/HTPC-ITX2-v1-Black-Ultra-small-aluminum-chassis-HTPC-ITX2-B.htm;jsessionid=982812B247AED5F811807F17FB2FD139.qscstrfrnt05) ($64)

I’ve found that there’s next to no selection when it comes to buying a small, no matter how gorgeous it looks. If small and compact were not a requirement, I’d have settled on building my own PC. Which brings me to……..



**The Decision**


I ultimately decided to go with the [Zotac ZBOX nano ID61 Barebone](http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-Dual-Core-Celeron-Barebone-ZBOXNANO-ID61-U/dp/B008OHRFE0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360094341&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=id61) ($191). I added an 8GB stick of RAM and a 64GB SSD

The first thing to note is that [the ID61 is tiny](http://i.imgur.com/4Qy37Uc.jpg). It looks more like a [small wireless router](http://i.imgur.com/gIM603C.jpg) than an actual desktop computer and this is just what I was looking for. It comes with a 1.3GHz Intel Celeron 867 Dual-Core processor with integrated graphics. The processor is by no means powerful but I soon realized that I didn’t need it to be. The addition of the SSD and 8GB of RAM makes it fly through all HTPC related tasks such as downloading videos, and serving media. It boots to Windows 8 Pro 64-bit in only 9 seconds. After installing Windows and downloading all the required drivers, my first task was to see just how well it could play my videos. Simply put, it plays every video file I own without any problems. I attached my 1TB External USB Drive and shared it across my network and all devices can play files with no issues. Streaming 1080p videos from YouTube works well and Netflix also works effortlessly.

If all you want to do is stream and download videos,  stream media to network devices, and browse the internet, then the Zotac ZBOX ID61 + 64GB SSD + 8GB RAM combo will do all of that at a price of only ~$320.  If you wanted to save even more money you could go with 2GB of RAM and a 320GB non-SSD hard drive lowering the total price to $265. Zotac sells an ID61 will exactly these specs but it’s $18.99 more expensive at $283.99.





I thought I'd show you that you can get a decent HTPC in a tiny case and spend a lot less than you would custom building a computer.

Long story short, when I switched to Plex, purely just to test it, and within 15 minutes I knew I was never going back to XBMC.  I love Plex so much, I am not even interested in looking at screen shots of XBMC EDEN, (the new version that supposed to be King Shit on Turd Island) 

For my main TV watching activities

However, she may as well be Amish.  Don't get me wrong, she LOVES technology, but just as long as I'm the one putting it together, and reading her user manuals for her, and fixing and configuring every OPTIONS tab for her.  Other than that, she's a real tech wiz…

Since we cut the cable cord completely, iCarly and all the other kids shows that we all know damn well we all watch too, parents or not..)   and my wife to be able to watch her retarded shows (Saved by the Bell, Golden Girls, Cosby Show etc etc etc…ok I actually watch GG.  Screw you if you even consider lying and saying you don't like that show.  Screw you right in your soul.) 

Also
Before I would have to jump through hoops to hook a laptop up to the projector, since the shelf is high, and had to be small to fit on top of the projector shelf with it.  

(**BONUS PRO TIP**: The ROKU remote is Bluetooth, HUH?)

Luckily, noticed how damn snappy and wonderful the Netflix app is.  I had been testing a lot of devices and a whole slew of Netflix apps/channels on each device. Everything from my PS3, to the Netflix app built into Plex and XBMC to the Netflix available directly on my TV to the BlueRay player I was testing to blah blah blah blah.  You get the idea, Netflix apps errrwhere. 

**Let me say this by itself so you may completely understand:  The Netflix channel/app that ships with the Roku

The other official and featured channels available for Roku are also pretty good, I ONLY used the Netflix app on my Roku….until…

Until…

I built myself an unRAID server and had 18TB free to use, I could cancel Netflix and save even more money!

With my newfound love of Plex

Having tested the PlayOn channel on the Roku I was not expecting anything good.  

(In fact

 Bear in mind

I installed the Plex channel and was pleasantly surprised.   It instantly found my Plex Media Server and connected without a single issue. I had about 50 movies at this point

It was very stable, but it wasn't snappy.  It was nothing like the Netflix app.  It was slow and unresponsive, but it worked and was damn good looking. 

The fewer movies in the section, then 300 movies, it became unusable. 

After some research, therefore it could load all 300 (and eventually 550) of my movies in less than 3 seconds.  It was every bit as snappy as the Netflix app

The BONUS was the Roku + Plex is so easy to use my 3 year old hits the Home button, then hits ""Kids Movies"" or ""Kids Shows"" then scrolls over to whatever he wants to watch and launches it, like a boss. 

**tl;dr The Roku is awesome. It's not as powerful as other options

The PC + other hardware is located in a media closet connected to the rest of the house via extenders over Cat5e (HDMI, ethernet). I also use the HTPC as a Squeezebox server which runs 3 zones for music, controllable over the network via browser or smartphone app.

The final piece of the puzzle is a Logitech Harmony remote to make the system usable by the wife. For LiveTV/DVR I use WMC and for watching the media library

* Case- I wanted something small and was originally going to go with a HTPC case that looks like a receiver or something that will fit nicely in my theater cabinet. But since my theater cabinet is not designed as one it has supports on the front preventing any case from fitting inside. I could have went mITX but...o well. The case is nice
* Mobo- Do not know much about mobo's so I went with this one...
* RAM- Not a bad price for some 1866, safe?
* SSD-SSD wasn't necessary but I wanted it..and I found a good price
* PSU-Yea
* I already had an External HD that will store all my media...I might take the enclosure off this thing and install it internally..but I am scared to ruin it.

**Notes &amp; Experience:**

There is no hard drive in the list because I used an spare Seagate 250gb 7200 rpm drive. I am only using this as a media front-end. All media is on file servers. 

Pros:

* System has more than enough power to run XBMCbuntu pushing 1080p bluray rips off my network though HDMI. 
* Xmbc looks fantastic
* CPU &amp; board run at ~30-40ºC even while pushing 1080p mkv with H.264/AC3 content. I used the stock CPU cooler &amp; no case fans.
* mobo has HDMI out &amp; optical audio out on the back plate. There was also a header for the coax digital audio out. This is needed for me because my receiver was built pre-hdmi.
* CPU is never above 20% utilization.
* P/S is pulling 90-125 watts according to my killawatt
* Rosewill Remote worked out of the box without any configuration on my part. 

Cons:

* While HDMI video worked out of the box, as well as modify my /etc/asound.conf 
* I had to add ""client lanman auth = Yes"" to my /etc/smb.conf on my debian SMB server to allow XBMC to attach to my movie/tv fileshares. The Debian server is running default otherwise. However
* Case cannot fit a ATX power supply &amp; optical drive at the same time.
* There is a 5 to 25 second delay when starting movies
* Nitpick: I wish the case had an IR receiver built into the front bezel. Right now I have the remote's usb receiver plugged into the front usb port. but I'd love to clean that up.

Hopefully this information will help others figure out whats best for them. Also

**What I have**

Currently i have a media pc connected to my living room tv via hdmi.
I've xbmc installed on it.
I like the layout and look and feel of XBMC.

I've an android phone that can act as the remote when on the same network.
 
When Im using the phone as a remote it can be a bit laggy I

And I have a similar lag if I use Ubuntus remote viewers as a remote instead of the phone.

Overall tho I like it 


I briefly was also able to stream video from the HTPC to my android phone via upnp app (I think) but it was clunky an awkward to use.
 

**What Id like**

What i like to move to is central storage for media files. And have them accessible inside and outside of my house/network.
 
Id also like smaller computers connected to a tv in each room. I want these to be able to access the central storage and display films etc on the tv. I want to be able to control all of this by either a phone
 
Finally i would like to be able to stream content to the phone 
 
Id like to be able to do the above with a simple and reliable UI as would like it to be useable by others in the house
 
So is the above feasible ? 
Suggestions for set up/software/hardware

Bits I currently have that I would like to use (to save costs) but it isnt critical are

1 x HTPC – dual core processor, 2.5 tb storage over 2 drives, running xbmc, and ubuntu 12.10
2 x raspberry pi
1 x ps3 (I know it can stream from

I've always perceived HTPCs to be the ultimate solution to my entertainment needs. From my understanding they can pretty much play any digital format local and online, meaning I wouldn't need to buy a blu ray player since my htpc will have one, I wouldn't need a set top box because I have Netflix and amazon VOD, and now I wouldn't really need a gaming console because of steam's big picture. In other words it sounds like an all in one solution for my home entertainment needs.

Now here are my questions: 

1: is blu ray playback equal in audio and visual quality to a high quality blu ray player?

2: I've read on several forums that Netflix streaming and Amazon VOD block PCs from receiving 1080p quality content

3: my goal would be to backup my Blu rays onto NAS and access them through my HTPC. Do Blu rays lose any quality when backed up? What is the best format to back them up?

4: does audio quality suffer in any way when going through an HTPC? Is it possible to connect a surround sound system to an HTPC? If so what additional equipment would I need?

5: is HTPC gaming really worth it? I know Steam's big picture is still in beta

6: once we get some of these questions answered can you guys help/guide me with my build?

1332783331.0,regos,My experience of moving from TiVo to HTPC,c53x12,14,2,20,"I'm a TiVo user who's in the midst of migrating to a HTPC setup.  I wanted to share my experiences and impressions for anyone who's thinking about making a similar switch.

I've been on TiVo for about 7 years

I've been very happy with TiVo -- it just works, YouTube, photo sharing, etc. are less successful, but as a DVR, my TiVo has worked flawlessly.

So why would I switch?  Mainly I'm tired of paying $12.95/month for the privilege of using a piece of hardware that I own.  There are also other things I'd like to do on my TV, or view pictures from a digital camera, that TiVo doesn't do quite as seamlessly as it could.  Also, I was curious about the whole HTPC phenomenon (if you could call it that yet).

I wanted to stay with cable because the broadcast choices in my area are terrible

Building a HTPC seems like the thing to do, and settled on the Lenovo H330 (Intel i5 cpu, 8gb DDR3 ram, 2 TB disk, Win7 home premium 64 bit, AMD Radeon 6450 video card).  I connected this into my system right next to the TiVo, with HDMI running to the receiver/HDTV

With the PC and tuner card both in hand, but with one fairly serious glitch -- the Ceton card has a ""network tuner"" feature, which is supposed to allow other PCs on your network to receive a tuner feed from the card.  When I selected this option during the card setup, the PC crashed, hard, and apparently took the disk boot sector with it.  My only choice for recovery was to restore the entire disk from the hidden system recovery partition.

With the Ceton card installed

So now everything's been hooked up, and programmed its commands into my Logitech Harmony remote.  I've also added a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard/touchpad combo, because the little handheld keyboard/remote that Lenovo sells is only marginally useful.

After a month of use, the uptime on that box would be easily in the hundreds of days.  The Win7 HTPC has frozen a few times, requiring reboot.  The most problematic area of the HTPC seems to be in how it handles sleep/standby mode.  Coming out of sleep, it takes a long time to reconnect with the tuner card output, and occasionally shows bogus copyright or connectivity error messages while doing so.  For now I'm leaving the HTPC on all the time, and looking into apps that manage sleep settings.

The basic recording and live TV functionality of Windows Media Center is right on, media guide, manual recording, and interface navigation.  Plus it does so much more, like seamless integration with photos, videos and music on my home network, internet TV, etc.  Add in all the things you can do with Windows 7 itself -- web

The program guide is one area where WMC has impressed me.  I had always operated under the belief that this was TiVo's big differentiator, like single-channel and upcoming showings, are superior to what TiVo offers.  And the fine control available over WMC's recurring recordings are vastly superior to TiVo's Season Pass setup.  So far I have found only one thing that TiVo does that WMC can't do, and that's to set a scheduled recording to start early by a specified number of minutes.  WMC starts all recordings 3 minutes early by default.  TiVo allows the user to specify a number of minutes to start early, up to an hour I believe.

Video quality?  Well, the 6450 is more than passable, quite good in fact.  Color saturation seems a bit duller than the TiVo's video output, and contains more pixelation and motion artifacts.  A better video card would probably solve some of these issues, although I'm limited by the small form factor of the H330's case.

Noise hasn't really been an issue.  The H330 is a pretty quiet PC

So in conclusion, the economics of switching may not make sense. 

TL;DR:  I'm switching from TiVo to HTPC and it's going very well.

Edit: Corrected video card no. from 6570 to 6450.",self,t5_2rbfy,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/regos/my_experience_of_moving_from_tivo_to_htpc/
1372412585.0,1h8mx2,Some HTPC Build Help Please! I'm a tad confused.,kuetwo,11,0,7,"Hi Guys

Before I go about resetting up my HTPC box

Ideally I'd want everything to be away somewhere. I want it to not ever really be seen and I detest cables, but please point me out if I'm going in the right direction. 

This is what I'd like and please make any recommendations as you see fit. 

I'd like my 2 xbox's and my HTPC put away in to a cupboard (or in the lounge in a unit) . These Xbox'es are different, it's more a matter of being able to play both Xboxes in both rooms. Adding onto that, I have a HTPC box, which I'm still unsure whether I'd like to have to run all the time as I don't see it entirely neccesasry and I'm mostly home in the evening. I had planned on putting SABNZDB onto the HTPC, but after a bit of research I found out that I can use the Raspberry Pi as an always on Usenet download and to host all my Usenet programs. (Sickbeard/Couchpotato/Headphones/Sabnzdb), but I'm not entirely sure the process I'd go about making the Raspberry Pi into a dedicated always on box that will be able to download shows (say to a  single 2TB hard drive ) (which I would then manually move the data when it's full to my HTPC box) wirelessly (or wired). 
	- In essence the Rasberry Pi would be a usenet download to literally download to a 2TB constantly which I'd be able to access via Windows Explorer and be able to move onto  my HTPC box (this is depending on if I'd use the Raspberry as a USEnet machine or my HTPC box)
	
Now I thought about taking this setup

All of these components would go into my projector which is in the lounge (projector only has one HDMI) and there's the second LCD in the bedroom.

Carrying on from this point, but I'll take advice please, and I beg for it. 

A couple more points I'm not too sure about: Should

1. Use the Raspi as a XBMC ""dummy box"". That being setup it up in the bedroom (instead of using the Raspi as a USEnet box. My main issue comes that I don't really see the point if I'm trying to get both xbox's to my bedroom, there will no point. I'd use my Logitech Harmony with the projector, (flirc) and then I'd just use me or the girlfriends smarthphone or something as the remote. I'm not too stressed as I guess I could always just get a remote blaster, and have a second remote for the bedroom.

2. Should I rather use the Pi then (based on the above point) as my USEnet downloader. I really don't want my HTPC to be on all day (it's my server too, and then move stuff off that to the HTPC hard drives? Is this a viable solution. As well, Could I inconjunction with this Headphones/Sickbeard/Couchpotato suite use my Raspi at the same time as a way of managing my network using DyDNS etc etc. 

3. The best and cheapest solution for the 2xbox/HTPC sharing amongst rooms solution. Wireless HDMI looks awesome

4. I'm not from the States

I'm not sure

It ended up being significantly cheaper than that because I get Windows free

The case is gorgeous, but I had to remove them in order to fit my PSU in, as well as one of the case fans that comes with it.  It wasn't a big deal for me, since I'm only using the SSD for this build and pulling all movies in from my home network, but if you want to use one of the silverstone HTPC cases, definitely read the measurement restrictions carefully.

Cable management was a bit difficult, overall, I don't think it came out too bad.  Idle temps on the 560 Ti are low 50s degC and the i5 is running at around 45 degC with only the two remaining case fans and stock CPU cooler, but I'm going to look into some better cooling solutions to try to get those temperatures down just a bit.

Things I don't like:

* Can't upgrade parts (video card/cpu)
* Underpowered?

Hopefully this parts list will be useful to some of you:


**CPU: Intel Celeron G530** (2.4ghz dual-core Sandybridge) with HD 2000 onboard graphics. (I actually have one G620 and one G530

**Motherboard: MSI H61M-E33 (Open Box)** - $64 at [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130588R) (I paid $50

**HDD: 500GB 7200RPM WD Caviar Blue (Refurb)** - $25 shipped from Blinq.com's eBay store. (Due to the current HDD shortage this component will likely cost you more. [Here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/SEAGATE-320GB-SATA-ST3320820AS-APPLE-GENUINE-MAC-DESKTOP-HARD-DRIVE-7200RPM-/180766270378?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a168263aa#ht_1207wt_1026)'s a 320GB refurb for $40.)

**RAM: 2GB DDR3 Microcenter Brand** - $10 at [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0353218) (Actually a 2x2GB pack for $20 that I split between the two machines

**Case: Sentey Slim mATX** with 450W Power Supply - $40 at [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0357147).

**Total:** ~~~$175~~ $165 (edit: math is hard) (Maybe a little more now that HDDs are expensive and the mobo went up

**Notes:**

I planned to get 4GB of RAM, 2GB would probably be enough, so I tried it and it is plenty.

The HD 2000 onboard graphics are great. For a dedicated 1080p HTPC, live and DVR'd HDTV in WMC, Hulu Desktop and HBO Go in Chrome all without issue and with a clearer image than I used to get from my old HD Comcast DVR box.

For live TV

They are kind of big. Especially after using the Revos, so they are now completely out of sight. If you want something that will sit on your component stand and look like a DVR, you should plan to spend a bit more on a Mini ITX board and case.

They are a tad loud. When I'm watching something, and when the rest of the room is silent, the fan noise is noticeable. It's annoying since the machines run very cool, so it's unnecessary. I just ordered some $9 Zalman fan controllers from Amazon and expect those to solve the issue.

No optical drive. I already have a PS3 on one TV and DVD player on the other

Anyway, but it has met all my needs and made me very happy, so hopefully this will help some of you.

* According to the silicon dust website it seems you need windows 7 media center to be able to view encrypted channels

* Does that mean Windows Vista or Windows 8 media center would not work? 

* Does every device that I want to watch from have to then have Windows 7 Media Center? Or does only one have to have it and then you can just stream the video to other devices via DLNA or something? 

I ask because I have multiple devices in my house and I'm trying to figure out what would work with this. I have two google tv boxes, Windows 8 PC, and a Windows Vista PC. The Windows Vista PC is the only machine that I have that has Windows Media Center.

I got all my parts for a real total of: $568.65 -I took an old OCZ Vertex 2 ssd from my current build.


You know that feeling once you build a computer, shows, music, as well as a back up for important documents. 

The build was rough in the beginning. Here are some problems I ran into:
&gt; * I first ordered a Corsair PSU with only 4 SATA connections - forgot about my SSD to run Windows. Luckily since I didn't open it and realized right after I ordered Newegg RMA'd it for nothing.
&gt; * The god dam case - while it's a thing of beauty
&gt; * Worst of all, checked the specs on newegg for the mobo and the case AND the box for the case and they all said it was compatible, but I can assure there were no options to add stand offs for that. I ended up leaving a bunch out, which meant I had to be super careful not to push my SATA connectors to hard onto the end of the unsupported mobo.

You guys helped me a lot


The only problems I have left to figure out is how the hell to get the sound to my TV. I have the HDMI plugged into the TV, XBMC is frustrating to set up? I can't for the life of me add the default pathway to where I want to put media I set up. I also want to set up my harmony remote, but I have to get an IR receiver first. Anyway - critique, feedback, or any comments are much appreciated. Thanks again.

I am looking for a home theater pc setup so I can cut my satellite cord. I would like to keep the cost at a minimum but I understand that it could get expensive quickly so I don't have a budget yet. Therefore I am planning on building this in stages.

First I will tell you **what I have:**

* Total of 4 tvs in the house. All tvs can receive HDMI input.

* The main tv in the living room has a blue-ray player and surround sound.

* 1 Roku 2XS with the plex channel

* 1 [Acer Aspire 5810TZ] laptop with a useless screen. At the very least I can use the Windows License key to upgrade to Windows 7.

* A crap-ton of dvd’s we need to rip and store centrally.

**What I need:**

* A basic htpc for each tv (a total of 3 since I think we can use the Roku for one of the kids

* A central pc to be the media server and do the LEGAL torrenting. My internet connection is super slow so I was going to schedule the torrenting while I am at work or asleep.

* At least 2 of the tvs (the main one and the one is our bedroom) to be able to stream from Netflix

* The 2 kids’ tvs can survive on local content and don’t need streaming. HOWEVER

I was thinking I could start with a couple of the basic htpcs and build the Media server later so if you post a list of components please break the list down into what I need for each stage of the build. I could put my local content on an external HD for now and get by with it for a little while. The Media server will sit on a shelf in the pantry next to the router and be hard-wired to each of the tvs.

If you have a different way of laying this out I am open to suggestions. With a family of 5 it is difficult to cut the cord but I am determined to get there eventually. I will happily Paypal someone a few $$$ for their help on this.

**TL;DR Help a family of 5 cut their cord with a whole house htpc set-up and maybe get a few $$$ in the process.**

Sorry for the wall of text. I appreciate any and all input as I have never built a pc before.

**Goals**  
* **Low Cost**: I previously built a decent PC thanks to /r/buildapc
* **Declutter**: Current home theater furniture setup consists of a Denon 1613 AVR, router and receiver, laptop, and a ton of dvds/blurays.  I'd like to get rid of the dvd cases by ripping them with MakeMKV and sticking them on storage as I get more funds for more drives; ditch the ugly cable box; stop using the PS3 for blurays and move it to another location for gaming; and, get rid of the laptop for internet access (it's a pain and unsightly to plug in the VGA and 3.5mm audio, then unplug and take it elsewhere).  Even with cableporn, it's a nightmare behind there.  
* **Stream** HBOGO, Pandora, and possibly others as new services pop up.  
* **Play music** from multiple iTunes libraries and CDs ripped to networked computers.  
* **Internet access**.  
* **Cable DVR** - The company box is pretty ugly and large.  I haven't included a cable card reader in this setup
* **Centralized control** - I'd like suggestions about remotes, the remote will also be useful for internet access.  Is there an iPhone or iPad app for that?  I'm aware of Hippo, but not sure if it will work on this.  

**Future Goals**  
* Add a **server** as I rip our DVD/Bluray collection.  
* Add a **Bluray drive** for friends who come over and share discs.
* Ability to control **home automation and home security** - cameras
* Add control for speakers in different areas of the house - this may be an AVR upgrade

I was planning on using Linux/XBMC/Plex.

I was thinking a setup with a Cable Card tuner running W7/WMC

1. We have an extensive DVD/Blu Ray library and would love to store rips of these on a hard drive (as well as DVR content).  Most of our discs are DVD.  How big would the files be for let's say a two hour movie with a good compression codec at 720p? How big are the WMC files at 720p?

2.  Can I use a program like MCEBuddy to remove commercials in WMC?  Is there a way to set up an “autobatch” where whenever a video on the DVR is finished recording, and creates a commercialess file?  How long would this process take for let's say an hour tv show?  Is there a similar setup to convert CopyOnce to CopyFreely (not sure how my cable provider tags the channels).

3.  For Non-DVR content

4. Follow up question

5.  Our ISP has the 3 strikes your out rule, NBC.com, Revision 3, etc.  Are there stable plugins/extensions for XBMC or Plex that I can watch videos hosted by these sites (regular Hulu not plus).  What about for services like Netflix or Vudu?  Would I just use the browser like a computer?

6.  I would like to make this setup as easy to use as possible for my wife. What do you recommend as far as programs, where it will “feel” less like a PC and more like a DVR 2.0 for her?

7.  We're thinking about making the main server HTPC in the living room, will Wifi be fine networking all of these units together? (aka pulling a video from the main living room computer's hard drive to the computer in the bedroom?)  I think pulling cable is out, if wifi won't work, what about powerline adapters? Or would using a splitter in the living room, one for the modem/router and the other for the cable card be the best option?

* I5 3570k
* 16G DDR3 1600
* 64G Samsung 830 boot drive
* HDHomeRun HDHR3-US
* No discrete video

So, but now that it is together I'm not sure what to do with it.  I have been trying in vain to figure out a truly solid appliance like package, I really just want to set this sucker up and not touch it for the next 7 years. Unfortunately, between the myriad of options and my total lack of experience, I have just stalled out.  Advice would be highly appreciated.

Ok

Should I go with Frodo Beta or Eden?  My gut tells me that since I require PVR functionality

Should I use Xmbcbuntu, but if the reason is compelling I can bite the bullet.  I already installed Windows 7 Ultimate, but I can change if I have reason.  Windows 8 looks more like a ""10 foot interface"" and I have read some people say they liked it on forums, but nothing real solid.  Again, I am going for appliance-like

PVR Backend?  This one just has me lost, I want to avoid Linux if I can, but if it is really far better than the competition I will do it.  

Right now I am leaning towards NextPVR, but lightning quick response and currently being rapidly developed.  TvHeadend seems to have a lot of backing in the XMBC community,  It also is Linux.

So...any suggestions?

Currently I have a jynxbox android based box

I have built a few gaming pc's but have not built some for a couple years (circa 2010) so I am out of the hardware loop. I know i should be able to build something that will handle media without breaking the bank.

Zotac's zbox offering is a interesting concept.  Wondering if one of these may ultimately be the best solution.

That said I would like to start looking into building a PC to replace this awesome Wii. My budget is around $400-$500

The only initial features I need are the ability to output 1080p video

By the time I am finished, and a 360 controller to play games. I’m guessing this would be Bluetooth. I would also need some kind of Wi-Fi adapter/card. I would also like to access this PC from any TV in the house via roku boxes with PLEX.

So here I am

**CPU:** Needs to be powerful enough to run Wii/PS2 emulation

**MOBO:** Decent amount of expansion slots. (video card and tuner are planned upgrades), and decent audio.

**HDD:** looking for around 2TB to give me some room to grow my media collection. 

**PSU**: I have no idea how much power ill need to run this system

**RAM:** Im guessing 4-8 GB

**Case:**  Smaller the better, multiple hard drives. Would also like to avoid overheating and noise. I’m not against a large case if by the end I get rid of all my consoles and dvr in the process. Would prefer front USB 3.0 slots for IR receiver / Bluetooth / wifi dongle

Anyone have any expirence building something similar? Ideas for parts? Any help would be appreciated.

I shutdown the sytstem.
I pulled the cablecard out of the I4 and then removed the I4 from my case and then powered back up my HTPC.
I plugged in the I6ETH and slid the cablecard in. The blue light blinked for a bit and then went solid. The I6ETH is plugged into a gigabit switch that my HTPC is also plugged into.
I then downloaded the latest version of the Ceton software for Windows 8 x64 and installed it without uninstalling the old version (this would cause problems for me later).
I then called Time Warner and gave them my old pairing info and then gave them the new pairing info. They had me pull up the device homepage and click on a few links to verify that everything paired up correctly. The call took about 10 minutes at most.
I then went into Windows Mediacenter and ran through the tv setup wizard and it found the new 6 tuner device and I was off and running.

I checked a few channels and then tried to upgrade the firmware on the I6ETH. I'd select the stable options and click the update button and the software would throw a .net error. I rebooted the computer a few times and then finally sent in a support ticket. I decided to uninstall the Ceton software

I found out that the GPU and the MOBO was dead and her co-worker told me to keep the PC for my troubles.

Looking around at work I found a old PC with a motherboard that match the previous computer 

This is what it looks like inside

* CPU: AMD X2 6000+                   Free
* Mobo: Gigabyte GA-M51GM-S2G   Free
* RAM: 4GB of DDR2                      Free

* Case: nMediaPC 5000b              69$
* HDPLEX IR Receive                   24$

For a total cost of little bit higher then hundred dollars.
The Case and the Remote are extras... but I think its not and HTPC if it doesn't look like one ;)

Run 1080p without and surprisingly does 3D as well
Not 100% silent but still pretty silent
Future Upgrade would be Bigger HDs and a better PSU then run it as a always on data server.

A6 is $50 at Microcenter, I just did not want to cheap out on the MOBO. Power supply as well, I kind of do not know much about these, chose a semi modular one to have less cables. Optical drive doesn't really make a huge difference from what I have read; we never watch blurays. Read good things about the IOGEAR; even with the trackball problems seems to be a good choice. The case is for aesthetics mostly, but it seems pretty practical as well (maybe with the exception of the DVD drive bay limiting CPU cooler size).

OS will be windows 7 64 bit.

My father has a huge Jazz CD collection and likes to play them as opposed to burned FLACs or something (which I will put on the HDD anyway) so I decided to try out the HRT DAC

Plex + Roku Boxes

WDTV Boxes in each Room?

MediaPortal + &lt;Some sort of client&gt; in each room?

My hope: To be able to switch to a cable card solution and be able to view TV in three locations even thought wiring may be impossible to extremely difficult.

The rub: The local cable provider is all digital encrypted so its a set-top on every tv.

I'm just curious what everyones home setup is?  I've gone through a lot of htpc setups over the past decade and my current one has been great!  My current setup is as follows:

Hardware  
QNAP TS-212 NAS (About $450 with 4TB of space)  
Apple TV2 (x2

Software  
nzbget and a modified nzbgetweb running on the QNAP device  
netflix on atv  
xbmc on atv  
custom nzbgetweb xmbc plugin

I've made modifications to nzbgetweb that will let you search nzbs.org for nzb's

Now with my setup I'm able to watch netflix from the apple tv or load up xbmc to download and watch movies/tv shows.  I'm thinking that I may now be able to replace my apple tv with a cheaper rasberry pi running android and have all of the same functionality with more potential for the device.

So what's your setup?  I've been trying to think of additional uses for a setup like this such as home security or maybe even a low cost smart home system.  Do setups like this even have a name? htpc seems a bit limited.  I'm also thinking of setting up some sort of site or board to allow people to post their setups so that other people can recreate them or post features that they'd want that other developers like myself may be able to create for them.  Does something like this exist already? or would you be willing to participate/contribute to this?

Anyways sorry for all the random questions and unloading

1353779028.0,13py0m,Remote control setup guide,the-0ld-man,8,0,2,"Hi

here is my remote http://i.imgur.com/YetzR.jpg 
it's pretty terrible

My remote control worked fine in XBMC but did nothing at all elsewhere in windows. I wanted to be able to use it with spotify and also use it to start XBMC - they were my 2 main goals.


so

1: Work out what keys windows thinks are being pressed when you use certain buttons on the remote

2: Set up shortcuts



To find out the key presses i used a program called showkey.exe
you can download it here http://xbmcmce.sourceforge.net/
Run the program and then point the remote at the sensor and press a few buttons. You will see that different key presses start coming through. make a note of all the key presses for the buttons you want to use as this will be needed later to set up the shortcuts. 
The commands appear as follows:
&lt;f mod=""ctrl, 3)&lt;/f&gt;
i didn't need all the info

now you will need to download the program to create the shortcuts. Autohotkey
http://www.autohotkey.com/
When you run this for the first time it will create a sort of tutorial script
i got a list of the input codes from here: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
the main inputs were all at the top of that page. Ctrl, !, + and #)

These are the codes i used for the media commands (your inputs
;media
^+p::Send {Media_Play_Pause} 
^b::Send {Media_Prev}
^f::Send {Media_Next}
^+s::Send {Media_Stop}
^p::Send {Media_Play_Pause}

script for programs:
;programs
^e::run C:\Program Files (x86)\XBMC\XBMC.exe
^m::run C:\Users\******\AppData\Roaming\Spotify\spotify.exe

I'm using windows 8 so i also wanted a button to act as the windows key to get to the metro interface. There seemed to be some problems with this
;other
&lt;^+t::
keywait ctrl
keywait shift
keywait t
send {LWin}
return

the key press on the remote is picked up as ctrl+shift+t - this script waits for the keypress

I also found that in windows 8 you can run metro apps from the cmd line. (try it press winkey+r for a run command - then type netflix:// -assuming you have it installed) there is a list of some of the apps here http://www.itsjustwhatever.com/2012/10/28/launch-windows-8-metro-apps-from-a-desktop-shortcut-or-command-line/

so anyway i wrote a line of script to run netflix
^i::run netflix://


After setting this all up you will want to put a shortcut to the script in your startup folder! that way you'll have it ready everytime your htpc boots up.
Amazingly



hope this helps somebody. I'm not an expert by any means,,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,True

1351278607.0,124zen,[xpost] PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Using a motherboard with RealTek sound and using a separate line/port to your subwoofer? Having problems with the bass? Or tired of plugging/unplugging your headset all the time? READ THIS.,Inq_,12,4,0,"So... I was very happy with my purchase of a T-amp and JBL Control One's. I had previously used a Creative I-trigue 2.1 system so I was prepared that my new system would need a a subwoofer. I figured why not keep the Creative sub, connected to front port) I would need to find a solution if I was listening to normal stereo

SURE

**Well

1) Install Realtek HD Audio manager (if you haven't already).

2) Run regedit.

3) Go to the following location:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\0000\Settings\ and you will have something ending in DevType_0XXX_XXXXXXXX

4) Find the following for any port in use (PLUG IN THE STUFF YOU WANT TO USE!)

""Pin00"" = Rear Green-Coded ""FR FL"" jack

""Pin01"" = Rear black-coded ""RR RL"" jack

""Pin02"" = Center/Subwoofer
""Pin04"" = Mic-In

5) Check the codes. They define what a certain port (PIN) will be. 

""01 00 00 00"" = Mic-in
""02 00 00 00"" = headphones
""04 00 00 00"" = Front speakers
""05 00 00 00"" = Rear speakers
""06 00 00 00"" = Center/subwoofer
""07 00 00 00"" = Side speakers

6) Change or clone any port you want! Need a second front port for your headset? No problem! 

Example if i want ""Pin01"" = rear black-coded ""RR RL"" jack to be front speakers all i have to do is Pin01 - 04 00 00 00. 

7) Set your setup in HD audio manager to stereo (2 speakers).

8) Make sure that your speakers are marked as fullrange (if they are).

8) Restart the computer.

9) Enjoy nondistorted bass or a dedicated headset port. :D Your computer now behaves much like Win XP did. None of this messy Win7 bass business. 

In my case, I can connect them to one port, the bass to the other (which has its own crossover so it is really fullrange too) and now I don't need foobar. I get full undistorted bass all the time, and was even able to use the headset port on the old system control. :D Hell, I can even connect the old tweeters if I want. :D

1349785363.0,116xmh,Need to build a HTPC..need some advice,,11,2,25,"So i'm interested in building a HTPC but I'm kinda torn on what to do. 

I'm using my current PC to host my media/plex server and watch movies (mkv's) on my tv. It's okay for the most part but i'm having a few small issues that could be solved with a dedicated HTPC. 1. I'm running out of space so i need to expand and get more drives. Also another issue is my current CPU  (amd 1055t) i believe does not have what it takes to process 1080p mkv's using plex to send to phones/ipads. It kinda struggles transcoding. The latest build of plex server seems to have fixed it somewhat and it does seem to stream better now but some movies still skip and stutter. So the question
i ask is
handle transcoding 1080p on the fly or do I just go with a less powerfull chip

The HTPC will be in my man cave w/ the home theater system 
and will do daily things like store all my movies/music/tv shows
usenet server probably w/ couch potato. Plex Server (transcoding to ipads and iphones, DD, DTS-HD, DD-HD ect ect. I will also use it to stream UFC.tv which I use weekly when
UFC is on.  I'd like to keep it under $1000. No monitor needed

I am trying to build a NAS but I want to make sure I have the most energy efficient parts but still have enough power to run everything. I already have a case and Orion HP585D power supply. I'm planning on adding two more 3TB harddrives in the future.

I plan on using the NAS to stream movies for multiple computers throughout the house so there might be about 2-4 computers streaming at a time. Most files will be bluray quality movies/shows. I also want to use PLEX to view the files from outside my home. Will this PC be able to handle it? Are the parts good enough or should I upgrade something or even cut back something to make the price cheaper? Also do you think a NAS will be able to handle the workload that I plan on giving it? Would the network be the choke point or the hardware?

My primary concern with this build was size. My entertainment center is only about 12 inches deep

I already had the processor, keyboard, and harddrive, so all I bought was the motherboard, case, and wireless adapter.

I plan on running Win7 x64 with either Plex or XBMC with a AMD PHENOM II X6 1045T 8GB Ram and a 128GB Solid State Drive connected to 50"" LG Plasma via HDMI. There is also a NAS device that contains most of the content that I watch.

If I cancel DTV I will put up an antenna. I have done this in the past from a location nearby and am able to receive all of the local networks. This may satisfy the fiance since she will be able to watch her reality shows as long as she can record one while watching another. I think I can also satisfy the kids with options other the DTV programming.

Question is what card works best for this?  I am looking at the Hauppauge 1213 WinTV-HVR-2250 PCI-E x1 Dual TV Tuner. Once it's set up though

1357327430.0,15yqpy,AMD FM2 Mini-ITX MoBo issues... Help me figure out what to do,RIP_KING,10,4,3,"so I purchased components for an HTPC a little over a month ago. Initially

So now that leaves only one other Mini-ITX FM2 board out there, and I just got off the phone with the manufacturer and they're on extremely short supply.  They said they MIGHT have 10 of them at the end of this month, but didn't know where they would get distributed and it seems increasingly probably that it will be extremely difficult to get my hands on one of these boards.

I've been able to locate a Zotac FM2 Mini-ITX board that will work.  The only issue is that its based on the A55 chipset and not the A75 chipset.  The only concern I have is whether or not I will see a meaningful decrease in performance only getting SATA2 out of the A55 board, and maybe a little gaming through Steam's Big Picture (with graphic settings understanding the limitations of my CPU of course).  Do you think the A55 chipset will be fine for my purposes? I'm less concerned with the native USB 3 support as the Zotac board has 2 USB 3 ports on it and I don't plan to have many USB 3 peripherals connected to it.  Are the Zotac boards considered on par with the other manufacturers? 

TL;DR Should I hold out and get the MSI A75 board or just get the Zotac board now. I'm getting pretty restless sitting on all these components. ",self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/15yqpy/amd_fm2_miniitx_mobo_issues_help_me_figure_out/

Firstly, please let me know and I'll bugger off :P

Okay. I currently have a ReadyNAS Ultra 2

What I'd like to do is combine the two into one piece of kit. I'd like to have a box under the TV which will do the following:

* It will run 24/7 in my bedroom (So preferably low power and must be very quiet)
* It will run XBMC continuously (So all I'd have to do is change the TV output to the correct HDMI port and we're sorted) (It will also have to run 720/1080p videos
* It will need to run SABnzbd
* I would like to be able to host a small ""Coming Soon"" page for a upcoming project of mine which will receive very low traffic (However
* I'd like to be able to remotely access the content on the server from, Sickbeard and Couchpotato remotely)
* Should be able to hold 4 hard drives

Not asking for much am I? :P

So my question is - Is there an already built server/HTPC that would be able to handle the above? Or should I be building one myself? I have built a few computers in the past

My goal here is to have something that acts as a network file sever, a media pc (hulu, netflix, south park studios, downloads), and a light gaming machine.

The price is actually about $60 lower than the pcpartpicker list due to some cheaper prices on the SSD and case that partpicker doesn't seem to know about.

I'm fairly confident that this thing will get the job done

1351074605.0,11zzqe,Looking for suggestions for silent HTPC / NAS / TV-Server,yugmav,8,2,5,"I was looking to build a passively cooled htpc that could do the following:

* NAS &amp; HTPC in one
* Stream Audio &amp; Video from HDD directly to attached TV as well as networked devices (tablet/TV/desktop) in 1080p
* Record TV to HDD and ""relay"" TV signal to other devices in the house (mostly tablet and another TV)

Parts i had a look at so far:

    Streacom FC10 Fanless Chassis (+ Streaflex 250 PSU)
    ASRock Z77 Pro4
    Intel Core i3-3225
    G.Skill 4GB PC3-12800U CL9-9-9-24 (DDR3-1600)
    Samsung 830 Series 64GB SSD
    2x Western Digital WD20EARX 3TB

Now im not really sure what hardware/power is need to handle the TV stuff

If i get a Twin Tuner Card ( http://shop.digital-devices.de/epages/62357162.sf/en_GB/?ViewObjectID=31109998 ):

1. Can I watch one TV channel on the TV directly attached to the HTPC (via HDMI) and stream a different channel to a tablet (via WLAN and easyVDR/streamdev or similar software)? 
Is 4 GB RAM sufficient and the i3 powerful enough for this?

1. How about streaming a TV channel to one device

1. To ""relay"" the TV channels and media to another TV in the house this TV would need some kind of ""receiving"" htpc of their own i guess?

Also im quite confused as to which mainboard to choose for this setup

1351023071.0,11yqai,"[Build] First HTPC build, dual purpose machine with emphasis on gaming, need input on (more) silent operation",InappropriateLaugher,8,4, but I think this is a situation where I want my cake and to it eat it as well.  In other words

First off, what I am trying to do now is simply quiet the machine down somewhat.  

Here are the specs:

* Case - Silverstone CW02
* Mobo - ASRock Extreme4 Z77
* CPU - i5 3570k 
* RAM - 32GB G.Skill 1866 (4 DIMMS)
* Storage1: RAID 0 (OS and apps) - 2x 240GB Mushkin Chronos Deluxe
* Content storage - 2TB WD Caviar Black 7200RPM
* Video - EVGA GTX 680 Superclocked Sig 2
* Tuner Card - Ceton Infinitv 4
* ODD - LG BluRay burner
* PSU - ThermalTake 850W Black Widow (140mm ball bearing fan)

* Cooling:
* CPU Cooler - Deepcool Assassin twin tower 8 heatpipe design with 140mm and 120mm fans
* Case: Intake: 2x Silenx 92mm intake fans mounted to baseplate of case drawing in air from vented panel the case sits on
* Exhaust (CPU): Gentle Typhoon 120mm mounted aft of CPU cooler
* Exhaust (PCI): Modified 140mm PCI cooler slot taken from my Lian Li PC2110b rig and modfied to fit the Silverstone chassis.  Fan is an NZXT


[imgur link to pics](http://imgur.com/a/xif2v)

Not sure how



The chassis lives in a BDI Avion 2 entertainment stand which has a slotted undertray that allows components to draw in fresh air from beneath and exhaust out the back of the stand.  There is also a oak door with glass windows between the rig and the user.


I haven't overclocked the CPU at all yet, and just relying on the Gentle typhoon exhaust fan to get airflow across the heatsink?  I am also thinking about ditching the PCI slot fan, but I read that the Ceton card can get hot, and of the GTX680 is going to generate some heat as well.  


I am going to move forward as follows:

* Remove 1 CPU cooler fan
* If still too noisy
* If still too noisy

Does anyone else have any other suggestions?  Liquid cooling is probably not an option

Thanks for reading.

1330641813.0,qdkvt,Thinking about upgrading 4yr old system to separate server and htpc systems. Thoughts?,tigerdactyl,7,0,9,"My computer was a fine mid range gaming machine in its day

I think that I could get by with upgrading the innards of the machine (mobo, or I could go with something like an HP Micro Server ([this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16859107052)). 


My current machine is as follows:

* Asus P5Q Mobo
* E8400 C2D Intel processor
* 4gb DDR2 800 RAM
* GeForce 8800 GT Video Card (I'd take this out of a server)
* 500GB Seagate HDD
* 2x2TB WD drives
* Antec 900 case

Any advantage to scrapping that and getting the micro server? On the HTPC side I haven't decided yet

My main concerns are power consumption

Thanks for any input.

Over the weekend I was scouring craigslist and came across a listing for this: Asrock supercomputer X58, i7 something CPU, 6 gb ram, 4 Harddrives: Two 1 TB raid setup, two raptor drives. Some superduper case. All this is overkill for an HTPC but I just couldn't resist. All for $400 obo. He agreed to $360. He was looking for quick cash in order to buy a gun at a gunshow the next day. Hmm.. I went to his house and it was not a shady deal in case you were wondering. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.

Then Ceton lowered the price of their Quadtuner to $199. Awesome. Anyway I should receive the tuner today and I already have my fios cablecard. Plex is installed and running.

Minor issues: The VFD on the X11 case doesn't work which is no big deal

I'm working as a bit of an assistant editor and my boss has given me a side job that I'm a bit out of my element on. He has a massive hard drive with a host of HD movies that have been acquired through various sources... Most of these are in MKV containers but he wants to convert them into a file format that will play nice with Final Cut Pro (essentially .mov files)

My (perhaps naive) thought is to run the files through handbreak into smaller m4v files and then transcode through Compressor

Additionally, alternatively, what did I do wrong when initially ripping the Blu-ray?

Given that I've managed to accrue a pretty substantial collection of programs related to this task

* Quicktime 7 Pro

* Compressor

* Handbreak

* MPEG Streamclip 

* MKVToolnix

* Make MKV (this is what I used to rip the Blu-ray that ended up as a 30 gig file)

* MP4 Tools

I want to build a HTPC that can run XBMC and Emulators for old systems now and that can evolve into a half decent gaming machine.

I already own the Nvidia GT 430 and 2TB drive and will use them.

I want the case

I considered doing a AMD APU build but I would have to spend more now and I don't like the long term potential of such a build.

I realise I'm putting a lot of money in the SSD but it should last me a very long time.

I would like the system to be as silent as possible. Should I buy another CPU fan? I know many people like this case

Edit: I think this case only supports low profile cards. What performance can I expect from ""high end"" low profile video cards? Should I go for a bigger HTPC case?

I found a Silverstone ML03B case review and build insructions that specifically suggested this power supply for this case so I'll go with the 500W version because that's what DirectCanada sells.
http://pcgamingcorner.com/wordpress/?p=3190

I also learned that a 140mm depth modular power supply is too big for this case if I wanted to install an optical drive because the connectors on the modular power supply stick out. If you want both a 140mm depth power supply and an optical drive

I don't plan on putting an optical drive but the option to do it will be nice. And for the build without optical drive

I bought the Samsung 840 SSD 120GB for a good price. I'm saving $50 compared to the Pro version and the slower write speed should still be more than sufficient.

I found out that Ivy Bridge CPUs require 1.5v DDR3 RAM. (my previous pick was 1.65v) I increased to 2x4GB so I would have more than enough and I think the value is good there.

Front end media stuff

 * Windows Media Center loaded up with media
 * Steam with a bunch of Big picture mode ready games
 * Also have connected the tablet youtube app to youtube.tv

Back end controls and other fancy bits

 * AutoRemote connected to EventGhost
 * BitTorrent talking to DropBox for incoming torrents
 * xPadder running to move around in WMC with the xbox controller...it works but its kinda clunky still

Stuff I've thought about doing with all this

 * Find a way to gracefully go from WMC to Steam to YouTube.tv to whatever else
 * Standardize all the controls, KB+M, and the xbox controller, they all can interface differently, I'd like to make it so they are all useful, in a perfect world I don't want to have to grab a mouse and keyboard to do anything unless I absolutely must
 * Find a way to kill Steam on my gaming box when I want to play games on the HTPC

* Core 2 Duo E4500
* 3.5GB RAM (it has a 2x2 kit but the BIOS only counts to 3456... far as I can tell it's a BIOS limitation related to integrated graphics)
* GeForce GTX 470
* 40GB HDD (doesn't need much... I have 2TB of RAID5 in my server upstairs
* DVD-RW (using as only a -ROM for now)
* Ubuntu 12.04.2 x86_64 custom

It's connected (via HDMI) to a circa-2005 Sony SXRD projection TV

At this point:

* gotten XBMC running at boot
* Steam is installed
* sixad is set up

Things I want to do:

* Steam doesn't see my DS3. Apparently I'll need to emulate a 360 controller with xboxdrv.
* Speaking of Steam... game selection is lackluster for the combination of Linux *and* local multiplayer (I have a proper PC gaming setup upstairs for when I'm home alone). Halfheartedly considering converting this guy to Windows. Really don't want to.
* Disable accelerometer in sixad so I can actually map buttons in games
* I'd like some kind of launcher outside XBMC. Something optimized for a TV setting where I can pick individual games that I've installed from
* Gotta install Firefox and optimize it for TV. Not really sure how to approach here either.
* My keyboard SUCKS. I need a pointer too.

I am trying to re-purpose a few internal parts from an old school HP media center that it came shipped with. It had a Hauppauge tuner (SD)

I was going to dremel a bay cover to add the media card IR thing and just the blaster to the back some how

I basically want to run my cable into media center

* budget not more that about $900
* dual OTA for viewing &amp; recording
* watch video streamed from net; Netflix &amp; Amazon
* watch video streamed from NAS (WiFi)
* watch an occasional DVD or blue ray
* listen occasional CD - no ripping needed
* listen/pull audio from NAS for playback (WiFi)
* quick boot
* very quiet
* Win7 OS probably WMC for video
* Winamp for audio
* WiFi N only; can't get Ethernet cable to HTPC location
 
It needs to be able to capture &amp; store away two simultaneous HD OTA channels while:

* watching a DVD/blue ray
* watching streaming HD online media
* listening to online audio (local NAS

I don't get-n-rip movies
This machine won't be used as a primary storage except for captured OTA

Video will be direct to LCD via HDMI.

Audio will be direct to amp via optical connection.

I know the SDD is overkill

The machine won't be used for any gaming except for MMOs/MMORPG.

I have the normal stream of questions:

* Will this processor keep up with my needs?
* Is the relative quality of components balanced?
* Any
* Are there some trade-off somewhere?

reusing this psu from another build CORSAIR HX Series HX750

For Hdds i figured i'd just reuse one of my old drives right now for the os drive although considering picking up a samsung ssd. For media storage i have a samsung Spinpoint F3 terabyte drive and just bought a WD red 3 terabyte drive.

I plan on using the htpc for just playing my 720p/1080p non 3d blu ray/dvd rips,genesis, and that sort of thing). Will the setup above be able to handle all of those things? I know i still need a remote but havent looked into that yet. We have directv and i would like to eventually add a tunercard to be able to record live tv but i have not done much research on the subject. I don't plan on playing any pc games really so i shouldn't need a graphics card correct? 

I'm not sure i have any other questions but feel free to shoot some my way if need be. 
Thanks everyone!

2: An SSD (Will be investing in a NAS next year)

3: Play/stream smooth 1080p video to my HDTV easily (with no lag.)

4: Something that feels quick and snappy. Trying to avoid a sluggish system that takes an eternity to start up

5: The ability to connect to a surround sound system.

6: Fast wireless connection. Currently using
[this router](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122466&amp;name=Wireless-Routers/) (not sure if that matters)

7: Something that is fairly quiet

8: Option to add a TV tuner in the future.

9: No need for gaming.

10: Ability to use a remote and wireless keyboard/mouse

11: Should I go with Windows 7 or 8?

12: Bluetooth? not sure if this is really needed or if it can be installed internally. What do you think?

My budget for hardware is $600.

Currently in the process of building my first HTPC. Have looked into it before but never pulled the trigger. 

I'd like it to: 

* Play 1080p videos smoothly (streaming and off the HD)
* Use XBMC as a frontend
* Be able to rip my Blu-Ray/DVD collection
* Be decently quiet/energy efficient
* Have HDMI ports to connect to my TV
* Run Windows 7
* Have a small profile

Here is my EDITED build:

[I will be using a 1TB hard drive which I already own for storage]

I have had some experience putting PCs together in the past, please feel free to point them out, it would be much appreciated.

My major questions are the following: 

1) What operating system would you recommend I run? I am currently leaning towards a simple Windows 7 build with XBMC to handle my media. I would like for this PC to remain open for access by any device in the house so I can stream video to my laptop in  my room

2) Is there a good way to integrate an Android tablet (looking at the Nexus 7) into this system to use as a remote

3) Is this even a good idea? I find the idea of an independent PC attractive, better solution?

Clearly I'm not entirely well informed on the project I am working on right now,,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,True

What got me into the idea was that I have recently discovered the world of Ubuntu and SFTP as a means to access files anywhere - so naturally I thought I would need a server that I could leave on somewhere and that would be that.. Things have escalated in my mind. I'm sure you're familiar with how it goes..

I've read the sidebar and dome some research.. But I've never built a computer before so would like some advice before I go and spend any money.

**What I will be doing with it**

Watching downloaded movies/tv shows: Downloading via torrents/usenet and playing using XMBC

Powered up 24/7 so it can act as a media/document server

I envisage maybe using it to stream to a computer/portable device in the future not more than one at a time - so dual core is ok right?

Space is nice but I don't think initially i'll need more than 1TB - can I get away with one hard drive? money is a kind of issue..

I'd like to load calibre on it and get it hosting my ebook library too

Basically not that intensive stuff as these things go I don't think

1365012187.0,1blo2o,HTPC with Plex MS setup,Mettle82,6,1,14,"My TiVo just isn't cutting it anymore so I am looking to use my home PC as an HTPC and use Plex Media Server to stream recorded content to a Roku 3.  I have a few questions on this setup and whether performance will be an issue.

First

* i5 3570k quad core processor

* HD 7770 GPU

* ASRock Extreme 4 mobo

* 8GB Ram

* 128 GB SSD 

* 750 GB HDD


My SDD holds windows 7 and program files while my other HD is used for media.  My currently plan is to purchase an HDHomeRun Dual Network Tuner and use WMC to record my usual shows from my antenna.  I would set up Plex MS on my PC and use it to stream the 'DVR' content to a Roku 3.


What problems might I see with this setup?  Technically, I wonder about my PCs abilities to do the HTPC work as well as anything else I may be doing on the PC at the time.  For instance, I often play games like Path of Exile or Civ 5 while my wife is watching her shows.  I am assuming that my processor will be able to handle the transcoding and gaming, but I'm afraid it might be an incorrect assumption.  


I'd also like to note that I have an old PC that I could use as my DVR and media server, 4gb ram, and HD 4850 video card.  I worry about the transcoding while streaming with this PC, though it may do the job just fine.  


Any thoughts on this setup are appreciated.  Thanks for the help!

I plan on ditching cable, and would like to take advantage of this before making the cut. 
The only mistake I made in purchasing parts for my HTPC was that I bought the Hauppauge 1187 WinTV-HVR-1250 to go in my Silverstone MLO3B

So, the other as a simple capture card that receives digital content from my current cable box.

And some other questions:

* Can I simply use it as a 'VCR'
* Are there restrictions when using a video capture card with digital content?  Once I drop the cable box and plug the coax directly into the card to use as a tuner, which is an offshoot of TimeWarner, so they tend to share a lot of the same resources - for instance we also have RoadRunner cable.)
* Has anyone gotten PVR to work through XBMC directly?  I've been reading up on it and it seems like it's somewhat involved.  Any good walkthroughs or resources for this?
* Any must-have software I should get for the things I want to do?

I thought I had more questions but they seem to be eluding me - need moar coffee.


As for my setup:  

* Silverstone MLO3B
* Mobo: ASRock Pro4-M (1 PCI-E x16 3.0

Im using XBMC on win7 that I have in a side computer room with its own set of speakers off the motherboard sound card and a DVI to he Monitor. I also have an HDMI out of the video card out to the Audio Receiver in the ""Movie Room"" and out from there to the Projector.  This all works fine.

But....anything Outside of XBMC such as the Blue Ray Player, etc only sound through the speakers on the MB, back in the other room and not the receiver.

Sorry I'm at work but am going to dive into this tonight

1. The primary thing I want to do is have a DVR that will allow me to record from my current cable and/or over the air antenna to a file that I can keep for as long as I like or transfer to another device for long term storage.

2. It needs to be easy to use so the wife won't have any problems with it. Simple interface with a simple remote setup would be best.

3. Get rid of our crappy cable box/dvr all together. (Milwaukee time warner HD if it makes a difference)

4. Being able to take video from another computer

5. Getting online content via wifi would be last on the list

I'd like to keep the price low to make it an easy sale to the wife and something that I could expand later. We only have one TV and do not expect to add any more in the near future. As far as experience with computer hardware

I have been stalking some of the threads recently.  I have seen that some builds come in at ~$200 and others come in at $600.  I was wondering why there are such big price differences.

For my requirements, and it to eventually have a TV tuner card added to record TV (I would do this once I build a NAS for storage).

I would never use this machine for anything other than displaying/streaming video and other video-like content.  I would also want it to look sleek.  I think an HTPC that blends nicely into a theater system really makes a big difference (look like a standard unit

With those requirements in mind

Thanks!

Additional questions:

Does anyone know if there is any open source slingbox-like software that would enable someone to remote control the HTPC and see the content on their own screen?
Can the HTPC be used as a slingbox receiver?

A TV Tuner card that supports Cable Cards. I was thinking:

1349641467.0,113ogl,Could this build make a proper HTPC ?,FLHKE,5,0,7,"Hi all

My current setup is as follows:

I have a PS3 which I almost exclusively use as a DVD/Blu-Ray player (I'm a PC gamer). I also have a Seagate Freeagent Theater+ for playing (up to) 1080p MKV files either from an external hard drive but mainly from a Nas4Free computer I have

Both the PS3 and the FreeAgent are connected to a Pioneer Amp (which supports DTS and DD), and it does the job so far).

I would like to ditch both the FreeAgent and the PS3

Here are the parts I'm able to salvage from my dad's old computer (I offered him a new one

- [Asus P5KPL-AM](http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_775/P5KPLAM/)
- Pentium Dual Core E5200
- 2 GB of RAM

I still have to buy a graphic card, and Blu-Ray player. I plan on going the cheap way, as I'll only be using the HTPC to play MKVs, Blurays, maybe a bit of youtube and surfing the web.

For the Graphic Card

For the Sound Card (as I'll need an optical output)

For the Blu-Ray Player

I have recently bought the Klipsch Quintet 5 speaker setup

I bought the speakers for $200. I am looking for a receiver around $300 and a sub that is around $300 as well.
I live in an apartment and will continue to do so for the next 5 years.
I have a friend at Bestbuy that may hook me up with a discount on the receiver and sub.
I just went to Bestbuy and saw some receivers.

$250 Receivers

Pioneer - 400W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass-Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [1] http://goo.gl/K8bMK I am not sure how Pioneer is? I have always thought of myself as buying a Denon

Denon - 550W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [2] http://goo.gl/ElyXT [3] http://goo.gl/C8clr I'm not sure what is the difference between these two models. I was recommended this at bestbuy. I think bestbuy employees get a good discount on Denon and its also a cheap reciever. I wish it haf more HDMI ports but oh well.

Sony - 945W 7.1-Ch. 3D Pass-Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [4] http://goo.gl/TgscJ Why is this receiver so cheap? 7.1 and better wattage then any other receiver? Do Sony receivers suck?

More expensive (but I should get a discount just like the smaller receviers)

Denon - 600W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver $400 [5] http://goo.gl/9iyz7
Denon - 875W 7.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver $579 [6] http://goo.gl/RYDmR This is probably too far outside my budget even with discount. Futureproofing would nice but I'm guessing that buy the time I get another system I will be able to toss everything out and start anew whith much better hardware.

Subs

I tried to make this work with the Thermaltake built-in PSU, but it looked to me like only the PW-200-M would do it.

The next problem was the AC/DC converter.  The Dell DA-2 seemed ideal, and it works fine.  At $50 it's a ripoff though IMO.  All the PSU calculators I tried for my build said I needed 185W max.  That's my biggest concern with this build, but so far it's worked fine.  I had to build a mount in order to put the PSU in it, and that was the largest amount of work.

I swapped out the fan on the [Slim X3](http://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Profile-Height-Cooler-CLP0534/dp/B003WOL4UG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337806686&amp;sr=8-1) for a [Noctua PWM](http://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-R8-PWM-Premium-Bearing/dp/B006GD30UC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337806723&amp;sr=1-1).

So it makes basically no noise.  When I first powered it up with the Noctua fan I didn't think it had turned on it was so quiet.

So far, no marks or scratches. The mouse and keyboard is incredibly responsive. In fact, I can pause movies from literally anywhere in my 3 bedroom townhouse. The signal is that strong. And if you've already got a bunch of Logitech gear, this has the Unify adapter, so they can all run off this one USB adapter. Doesn't help me, but a cool feature.

A couple of notes: Since this was intended to be a controller for Google TV, the play and pause buttons don't work in  [Daum Potplayer](http://www.dvbsupport.net/), my favorite mediaplayer. Not a dealbreaker, because the space bar works just fine for pause and play. It's worth noting that the pause and play buttons DO work on Windows Media Player, though.

1) Have I gone completely overboard with a 400W power supply?

2) On a related point

3) Will this achieve DTS-HD/MA passthrough? And if so, or a linux flavour, or is Windows a pre-requisite?

Many thanks!

- Will run typical stack of Sickbeard/Sab/CouchPotatoe
- Will access HULU and Netflix 
- Will have access to an OTA HD antenna - would be nice to do some recording (not sure on software to do this)
- Would be great to have bluetooth for game controllers (would like to play various classic console roms)
- XBMC is the planned front end for the media center
- Would prefer if it fit the standard living room equipment footprint.   Not looking to put a tower in the living room.
- Network connection would be 802.11N
- HDMI output to TV
- Would prefer nvidia as I may eventually change from Windows to Linux
- Simple browsing would also be done

So, I have a USB-UIRT which means I can use EventGhost to control my IR components in the same way the harmony can--but with my Hauppauge MC remote!

This gives me the best of both worlds: quick responsiveness and multiple component control with one remote.

With EventGhost, it closes WMC. However, if WMC is closed (when TV is currently off), it opens it with added command lines to remove the startup animation. I have WMC closed when the TV is off because I use OrbLive to stream LiveTV to my phone/laptop and it doesn't work if WMC is open.

3. Stream media (downloaded files, the TV will not be near the router so anything would have to be wireless.

Build doesn't include any sort of remote or keyboard/wireless. I've also picked stuff that will allow me to add a second, so I have gone for an nvidia graphics card, as those seem to have a better reputation.


Am I looking at this wrong? Is the HTPC experience worth the extra cost? Can I reduce the price of the build enough to make it more competitive price-wise? Should I delay and wait for the next version of the Apple TV?

Hello all

**TL;DR** - Intel Celeron based HTPC/Media Server running Windows 7, play older PC games and Blu-Ray DVD. Sharp looking case with 4TB storage and future expansion capability.

****************************

After a good deal of experimenting with several solutions I've settled on PLEX for serving videos and music and Windows Media Center for TV recording and PVR functionality but this may change as time goes on. I'd prefer to go with Linux to save the cost of the Windows license but all of my research keeps pushing me back to WMC being the best solution for OTA recording plus I'd like to be sure I can still run windows apps and do some light gaming (**Fallout 3, etc..).

The system will sit in my living room next to my main TV connected via HDMI and then connect to the bedroom TV via the PLEX app on a Roku. I'll also use this system for playing Blu-Ray DVDs. I considered MythTV but went back to WMC so I could still run Windows based games and apps. My goals are as follows:

* Stream 1080i HD movies
* Record full 1080i broadcast resolution, Record, &amp; Rewind Live TV, Schedule and record TV shows (allowing me to get rid of my TIVO box)
* Watch and record two TV programs at the same time
* Energy efficient for low cost 24x7 operation
* Near silent operation
* Capable of running some older games
* Act as a small home server for other types of files (secondary goal)

Here are the parts I've chosen:

Other considerations were I wanted a sharp looking case and have components that were new enough that they will last at least 4 or 5 years before I need to upgrade.

I want to be sure I can expand this system as time goes on and add drives as needed so the case selection has been a challenge. Spent a lot of time looking at ""HTPC"" cases but could not find one I liked that met all my needs. I'm leaning toward the [Fractal Design Micro ATX](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352011) but I'm still considering the [LIAN LI PC-V354B](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112300). Would like to hear any comments you may have about either of these cases.

The motherboard and CPU selection where based on making sure it met all the above goals but be as cheap as possible. I'm indifferent to the CPU being **AMD** or **Intel** based but I am partial to **Gigabyte** or **ASUS** for the MB and when I was going back and forth selecting components I ended up with Intel. The other brands were selected for a balance between quality, hence the ""midrange"".

I am still on the fence with the [Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 TV tuner card](http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-1229-WinTV-HVR-2250-System-Builders/dp/B001E2T6Y4)

Having an SSD is not important to me at the moment but if I ever want to add one in the future this MB has a 6gb SATA connection. For now I'll install the OS and games on a Western Digital Raptor 740gb drive I have from a previous build. I plan on installing the stock CPU cooler and case fans and see how quiet it runs once I get it put all together

I'm not a heavy gamer so a high end graphics card was never a requirement. I'm expecting the on board graphics of the Intel CPU and Gigabyte MB will handle everything just fine. Finally I should add that I don't have cable

My original budget was $500 which I probably could have made with Linux, please let me know if you see any compatibility or functionality issues I may have missed. Thanks!

**The Setup.**

I have all my media devices in my laundry room with my servers (web and media), and tuner cards. This then feeds my bedroom, patio, and living room via HDMI over Cat6 with IR extenders. My 3 main media devices are Roku, HTPC running win8, and networked Receiver. Roku handles almost all stored and streaming content, and accesses my Plex server. HTPC is running WMC hooked up to a HDhomerun tuner and acts as my DVR. Then my Receiver is an Onkyo NR515 that is my input switcher and surround.

**The last Issue.**

Everything works together great, I know.

**Possible Solution.**

At first I wanted to create a better universal remote app that would handle everything

**TL;DR** Anyone know of an android app that switches between apps and send an IR signal to switch inputs at the same time? Also looks good? ",self,t5_2rbfy,1375809088.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1jti4o/entertainment_setup_remote_the_last_thing/

""Good"" for me in this case means a) runs a popular distro (like Mint) out of the box properly (mainly, c) gigabit networking, and d) low energy usage/low heat. I'd like decent performance when needed -- I might start getting into doing capturing or transcoding with it -- but mainly I'm interested in low energy, so I'd probably want something in the low-end Intel Core or 'i' families, but probably not as low as something like an Atom.

One thing I *won't* ever use this for is video playback. (I know, but I'll mainly use this to stream shows to computers &amp; devices in the house, including a Mac Mini (10.6/Front Row forever!) hooked up to the living room TV.) Streaming mostly happens over SMB, or HTTP via Apache directory listings. Fancy, yeah. :-)  (But I still want gigabit ethernet to make bulk transfers fast, like when I load up a laptop with kids shows before a trip.)

I've owned small corporate desktops in the past (like the old Compaq Deskpro EN SFF) and been happy with them; I don't know if there's something comparable and current that I should be looking at or if I should do the newegg/barebones thing. Honestly, one for backup -- and a third bay would be nice because I could start with, say, two 2 TB drives, then add one 4 TB later when my collection has grown and prices have come down.) Thoughts?

So then I got the Logitech DiNovo Mini hoping it would solve my problems. The keyboard is much easier and better to type on and my key presses always register (while the thing is working), the mouse becomes super laggy randomly, certain special function keys don't work anymore, or the entire keyboard just decides it won't connect anymore and I have to reset it via the battery or USB dongle.

So now I'm back to the drawing board because those were two of the higher recommended keyboard/mouse combos for HTPC use that came up in my research. What are you guys using? The two that I'm considering right now are the Cideko Air Mouse/Keyboard and the Rii,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,t3_1gnyxr

I'm thinking of using a smallish SSD for the OS and all the front end stuff, and then begin with a 2-3TB data drive with a matching parity drive. Then I could expand outward and have the protection to recover from a dual drive failure. Tools in Drivepool can apparently keep me informed of the health of my drives as well. This would hold all my data/media.

The big questions are what kind of hardware am I looking at and how big of a job is this? I'm fairly comfortable with setting up MediaBrowser (haven't checked out the new one yet) and all the Usenet tools

1371436894.0,1ghnit,Quietest CPU cooler for my set-up?,extremewonton,7,3,9,"Basically I want to know what types of options that are out there for aftermarket coolers? Mainly looking at fanless or low-noise fan coolers. On the Apex mi-008 case I put a pico-psu in place of the stock so I have more clearance for the cooler. Currently the cpu runs are around 22-23C so I am not worried about the cooling of rather the noise level of the rig. I did see a post by [frosty tech](http://www.frostytech.com/top5heatsinks.cfm) that shows the top coolers by noise and effectiveness. I am just not sure which one would work for my rig with regards to clearance for such things as the ram for example. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: After all of the advice I thinking I am going for the noctua fan for this setup. The low profile is a plus since it can be used another htpc setup in the future.

* The AMD A-5300 is working very well.  Win7 and WMC run smoothly and HD video payback is flawless with no stutter

* The MSI mobo is fine too.  I usually use Gigabyte and this is my first MSI product

* For memory, 1600mhz.  Newegg had a shellshocker deal on it so I went with it.  It's fine.  Running stable at 1600mhz, 1.65v.  Mobo recognized it immediately.

* I had the power supply and HDD on hand.  Not much to say about them.  An SSD would make the system a little snappier

* The Ceton InfiniTV 4 is pretty sweet.  Install was straightforward, but I see why they did it and it works fine.  

* I did go ahead and get a Ceton Echo as well because they had a package deal that saved $50.  It's working fine after a firmware update and some tweaking of the settings.  I was ready to send it back before I did the update

* Finally, which is more than enough for HD TV.  They're an ok option and super simple to setup if you're not needing a ton of speed.

1359735215.0,17p71l,What is the Proper Sample Rate Setup for an HTPC Connected to an HDMI Receiver?,vigillan388,4,0,5,"After reading through some various articles

**Here is my system:**

* Dell Zino HD HTPC w/ Radeon 5450 video card
* Denon 4311CI Receiver
* HDMI Connection

**Software Used:**

* JRiver Media Center (FLAC / MP3 music via Wasapi)
* Spotify (Streaming music)
* Windows Media Player Classic (mkv/avi movies)
* PowerDVD / WinDVD (Blu-ray and DVD

My receiver is capable of handling 24 bit, but also want seamless playback when going from one piece of software to another.

An issue I face now is that when I use JRiver in Wasapi mode, and I risk damaging my speakers. The music also plays incredibly slowly. The only solution is to go into the Windows audio settings, change the bit depth / sample rate to 24bit/96kHz, then back to 24bit/192kHz.

Another issue is that some multi-channel 24bit FLAC will not play without resampling in JRiver. I've also received the same resampling error if I try to play a video file in JRiver.

I basically want what I can bitstreamed to the receiver, DTS audio, and some HD video files.

I was asked by some firm to suggest them a media player. This company has a couple of ferries, but they skip and it is annoying for them to update the discs.

The screens have composite video input

The client asks for a device that has:

- Simple interface (and a remote control) for the stewardess to start playback.

- Internal storage

- Some USB port to upload material.

They just want to attach such device to each TV

I was joking with them to get a cheap old iPod touches with the dongle and tape it to the back of the TV... But I would like to come up with some options for these media box devices that seem to be popular at the moment. Would anyone here like to recommend some hardware?

I recently bit the bullet and got an HDHomerun Prime with a cable card and cable subscription and now I gotta build an HTPC for it!

I currently have a PC that I use as both as a gaming PC and a HTPC that I will be gutting for parts for this new build.

I also am looking into purchasing a NAS with (hopefully) either 2 or 4 3-TB drives in some sort or RAID (or unRAID

Ideally I would have a case that is very small with one external bay and 1 internal bay. I have an old-ish AMD Phenom xII 555 BE (unlocked 3 cores) that I plan to use as the CPU

Like everyone here

With respect to the NAS

Oh

Is all of this feasible?

Is it overkill to try to have an always-on HTPC? If I plan to do it like that

Is it possible to have the HDHomerun Prime record directly to the NAS? I understand that if I want to see TV shows recorded by the HDHomerun Prime

If my CPU is not enough for 1080p (currently it is paired to 2 video cards in crossfire), virtually no gaming)?

I have a couple questions.

* 1. Is the integrated graphics sufficient enough? Would there be any advantage over an AMD processor?
* 2. Any opinions on the new WD red drives? From what I've seen and read (mostly from WD marketing) is that they are built more for a NAS type set up. Also I was reading somewhere that WD green drives don't do so hot in RAID 1
* 3. I'm a frequent lurker at /r/buildapc and they would probably internet slap me for using a cheap PSU
* 4. What can I do with that Biostar remote?

I have 5 2TB Hitachi HDDs laying around and I was going to throw 2 of them into this case in RAID 1 for storage. Or I just may go RAID1 and use a cloud service as a backup. I was aiming to come in around $500 give or take $20 and played with an Intel i3-based build before piecing this one together.

Is this build overkill for my needs? My LCD TV is old so I can't do better than 720p. I feel like this thing will do everything I want and then some. For front end I am thinking of running WMC for DVR functionality and then XBMC for everything else. I also have a Harmony 700 remote I'd like to be able to put to use. I am a little worried about going AMD as I haven't used their chips in years. Also concerned I won't be able to route the boards USB3 ports to the front of the case chassis.

Please let me know if you spot any areas that are lacking, hopefully, I put it all to good use picking out these components. Thanks!

Hi Guys

I have been watching the Mini Android PC market intently over the last few months since XBMC was announced and have seen many devices come and go (MK802, CX-01, Pivos XIOS, Oval Elephant, ect).... But so far I haven't really been satisfied with the specs combined with the whole Allwinnner A10 XBMC spat and the fact that the Tegra 3 OUYA is due early next year have put me off buying anything.

But I have come across the MK808 for around $65 and I think the specs on look very interesting...

* Dual Core Rockchip 3066 1.6GHz (heard multiple reports it's actually clocked at 1.2Ghz)

* Mali 400GPU???

* 1GB DDR3

* 8GB nand flash

* 2x USB Host (1x full size

* MicroSD card slot with support upto 32GB

* Android 4.1 Jellybean

Looking at the [rockchip datasheet (pdf)](http://tabreview.ru/content/pdf_docs/RK3066_datasheet_brief.pdf) it looks like it supports neon and hardware video decoding.

Performance in benchmarks seems to put it at a similar level to the Galaxy S II and Galaxy Nexus.

So does anybody have one of these? what are your thoughts?

Does it run ok with a 1amp USB adapter (one person suggests it can't and needs a 2A

How well does it run XBMC? how about HD content? how well does it handle larger libraries?

First off, I should be able to get it up and running right away. If there's a possibility of getting decent HD performance with an inexpensive video card, please suggest.

I just completed my first build yesterday. The computer runs great, constantly. Whenever I play a movie or television show, that sound is output as well, but the static still remains underneath.

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem after finishing a build or if they might know what's causing the static output.

So, and music albums. I really like the look of the Popcorn Hour C-300's menus and how it automatically brings in album covers, movie covers, reviews, synopses, etc. but am not sure if I would just be throwing money down the drain again in terms of compatibility with my hard drives and future hard drives I may purchase.


Is it best to buy a media server box like that or should I build a pc that is a dedicated media server? The boxes are attractive of course due to the price and compactness. I can afford a media box right now but would not be able to fully afford a media center pc right now. How do I best do this? The only computer I have currently is just a laptop. I don't have a dedicated desktop at home that I could plug the hard drives into and then somehow stream to my TV. Please help!!


Please actually give me informative answers if you can. Not just some brand I should buy. I really appreciate this!!


**EDIT**: Price range would be from $500-$700 for the NOW stuff.  Price of LATER stuff is negligible at this time but if it can be added in this price range and still provide me with a very robust


**What I need in this machine *NOW* is:**

-A sound card that can handle crisp audio (component?) 
-This machine would be located in the living room near the TV.  
-I want at least 3 USB slots but the more the merrier.  
-One or two firewire would be nice as well since data travels faster from my external HD's over firewire.  
-Bluetooth of course (or whatever would work best for a wireless keyboard/remote interface)
-I want to be able to have 720p/1080p go to my television (by way of HDMI I'm guessing)
-Ability to move files from my main home computer to this server via the home network (basically be able to always add to my library).
-I want this to generally be a keyboard/remote only server.  I don't want to have to have a mouse setup in my living room.  But if I need to use one sometimes for file management and for the initial setup
-I want a really nice, etc.  Also synopses and reviews would be nice if possible.


**What I will eventually want within the next 6 months to a year is:**

-I want to be able to eventually run high quality surround sound from this machine(perhaps S/PDIF would be more appropriate for that?).    
-I would like to be able to stream my audio from this machine to other speakers or receivers in the house some day as well (deck speakers and kitchen speakers!)
-To be able to add an internal hd or two with maybe even the option of adding more down the road.
-Maybe be able to stream content to a second TV downstairs as well for the kids. This does not have to be 720p/1080p. I guess I can use some sort of cheap box for this but I just need to be able to have this box stream out to that box.  Also

By light gaming I mean steam indie games.  I mainly want to be able to play my local multiplayer steam games as well as run N64 and PSX emulators.  The most intensive game I can imagine playing on it would be Portal 2.  Not sure if a small ssd would be good for loading these as well as the OS.

For the HTPC part I'd like it to be as quiet as possible while watching media (not as important when gaming).  I'm also saving room for a tv tuner addition at a later point.  I'm not sure if recording live TV would be worth it if I use it as a seed box.  Also

I plan on leaving it on all the time as a torrent box/media server.  Mostly just for streaming music to my phone or at a friend's house.  It will be on pretty much constantly.

I can think of about fifty awesome reasons for something like this. Say I start a video in MPC-HC. I could throw a macro out to set the receiver to Surround instead of Stereo or turn on my TV.. When outputting a surround encode strait to a receiver you lose all windows volume control as well so anyone with a properly set up HTPC must be experiencing this too.

So am I crazy assuming this doesn't exist and I just can't find it?

EDIT:: My friend found [this](http://www.home-electro.com/tira2.php) Which seems like it is it. But it doesn't seem like it is going to be very user friendly.

I bought the [Pinnacle PCTV 80e HD Mini Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Pinnacle-PCTV-Mini-Stick-23058/dp/B003NUDZVA).  I chose this one for two main reasons - 1) I just wanted a simple tuner to watch OTA TV and 2) most of the other tuners out there seemed built for Win 7 with Media Center.  I'm running WinXP SP3 and since this was a little older it seemed better designed for my system.

My current config:

* 1.8 GHz Processor
* Win XPSP3 (not MCE)
* 4 GB RAM
* Asus 1GB video card ([EAH5450](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121447))
* 1 TB WD external drive
* Pinnacle PCTV 80e
* PC TVCenter Pro 6.4 (DL'ed most recent version from website)

**Synopsis of issues:**

Video will play just fine when I first open the app.  This may be for 10 seconds or 5 minutes.  Audio is out of sync half the time.  If I change channels it always starts to stutter immediately

I searched the knowledge base for this issues and followed their (Pinnacle's) [directions to run this on a slow PC](http://www.pctvsystems.com/tabid/62/default.aspx/Knowledgebase/tabid/231/language/en-US/Default.aspx) to see if that would help

I also checked CPU usage and it jumps from about 17% - 30%

Any suggestions to fix this?

Is their an aftermarket viewer I could use?

In searching Google I found a reference to MythTV and using that in XBMC.  If I read correctly on their site I haveto download the files then compile them from C++ to... something.  That's way beyond my scope of abilities.

I have set up a gigabit network

**disclaimer: I know NOTHING about linux. Have no desire in learning. **

The PC i'll be using is a semi-old duo-core 2.4ghz with 4gb of ram.  Nothing special.  Has 4 sata ports on board

Here's what I want to do: 

* 1) I want to be able to have 1 location. I dont want a separate share for each disk.  i want just one location showing the entire array as what I have for available space. if I have four 3tb drives, or whatever)  **edit: am I correct that unRaid doesn't allow one giant volume?  Each disk is it's own share?  2nd edit: nope. You can access all of your drives with one share. unRaid is looking like the only option**

* 2) I want to be able to add space easily down the road. With media libraries, I need whatever system I have to be able to use any drive and add the available space from that drive to the total available space.  ie: if i have four 3tb drives for space, and my network location shows 12tb available, and I add 1 tb to the mix, it should now show 13tb.  Not 2 separate locations or whatever.

* 3) please understand, that are just laying around.  It would be stupid to not use them, so while it's not super important, I need the ability to use any size drive, different types of drives, and all that. 
then, and add a bigger and I lose no data.  I'm not interested in obtaining 12tb of data all over again. 

* 4) it has to be easy to set up.  I've been messing with unRaid, but I set the wrong disk as the parity drive (I have 3 Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm drives, and one WD 5900rpm and I set THAT one as the parity. I read that I should use the fastest drives for the parity drive) so when i try to change the drives around it says missing disks, and I dont know what to do. I have no data on any of the drives right now, so maybe I should preclear the entire array again (another 37 hours) and just start over, but it's such a pain in the ass. i just want to get this thing up and running. i've been playing with it for 2 weeks and can't figure it out. 
Also, then add the 5th drive to the system, giving myself another 3tb.  if there was a way to just pop the 5th into the array and add the data that way, even better. 


so heres what I've done:  I have a sytem dedicated to plex media server, sickbeard and cp on the nas, that would free up a computer for me, but it's not super important.  The reason I bring it up, is unraid has an easy way to add sabnzbd via the unmenu gui.  I need super easy ways to add the shit I need. OpenMediaVault seemed to set up easily enough, but it woudln't identify certain drives with file systems already on them.  It uses raid I believe, and I dont think it's as easy to add drives later down the road, to say the least.  And the only way to add sab, but understand when I say i have ZERO grasp on linux


unRaid is expensive as shit

If your usb drive breaks (where unraid is installed) you have to buy another copy. You can't just email and ask for another key.  

I couldn't find any way to pirate it, or them forcing me to pay again if I used the wrong guid, or if my usb thumb drive dies is really not something I'm interested in.

I'll do it, or have them willing to honor a refund, or even a new key down the road.  Hell, if I could pirate it, I'd be willing to pay extra after I got it set up, since I'd know that IF MY KEY DIED IN A WEEK, I could get it back up and running without paying them another $200 bucks. 


**tl;dr: unRaid is probably the only way to go, but it requires a bit more linux knowledge than I have, at least to get it up and running the way that works perfectly for me.   Also, I'm unclear on how expandable it is in the future.  As I understand it, OpenFilier and FreeNAS are not expandable, but maybe I'm wrong.  help me /r/htpc. Please. **

**edit:  my friend said just enable raid and run that with windows, that I could cry as I type this.  I just want it to be fucking done and done without me having to worry about my lack of linux knowledge down the road.  arrlasjsfd;lajfl;ajsdfl;sja;lf**

1327948447.0,p3aj5,"My 3rd generation HTPC upgrades this weekend, amazing how far some technology is coming",blastershift,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/p3aj5/my_3rd_generation_htpc_upgrades_this_weekend/

Generation 1: HTPC playback was using Beyond TV software

Output was RC jacks to speakers

Used a HTPC case with black finish and it was super heavy.

This computer last from 2004-2008 -&gt; 4 year life span

Generation 2: Same case as Generation 1

Case was replaced after the faulty power supply was replace by the manufacturer.

Second Power supply (these are custom in shape so I had to use there's) went when the computer shut off at random. When I went to turn it back on the side of the case flew off (plastic fan attached to the metal case)

The wife came out wonder what the gun shot sound was I was standing them with a oven mitt on trying to rip the PSU out as it was on fire

I wanted to save as much of the computer and not burn the place down

So what happen? 

I had a friend look into this

I informed the company of there PSU issues

So I stopped by cases from them.

So a new case and psu that wasn't custom I got off kijiji for less then $150 bucks

Over the four year's this system had a few upgrades such as 8Gb of RAM

A lot of storage was added as movies and tv show kept growing in size.

Used Windvd Pro 9 through 11

Stopped paying for TV in 2010

Basically at the end of it's life span I start to use usenet to automate my downloads

This computer last from 2008-2012.

Basically this machine was still running good but was running into various issue.

The P5K board that bough in 2008 was hitting the four year mark

It always had heat issue but it seemed to get a bit higher even with monthly cleaning.

The onboard lan went funny on the P5k board so I had to stuff a PCI GB lan card in to fix that issue.

It didn't support ACHI without a cross firmware class from P5KE

Either the motherboard or the PSU was having issue as I was no longer able to turn the machine off

So it's almost the second month in 2012. Figured it was time to put some real money down buy good parts this time and hopefully it will last.

So memory express was having a good sale on for my replacement parts that I need and the third generation HTPC was born!

Generation 3:

Same case Silverstone LC16M

Replaced motherboard

Core™ i5-2500K
Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 
Patriot Gamer 2 Series
Enthusiast Series TX750M Modular Power Supply
OCZ Vertex Plus Series 2.5in SATA II Solid State Drive

Cost: $477 + 30 bucks for in store product replacement.

Really nice set-up for less than $500 bucks.

Best part is I spent better part of ten hours rebuild the entire system.

The video card has been removed and so has the lan card.

As the Core™ i5-2500K and Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 have HDMI out using the Intel HD 3000.

Using Windvd Pro 11 for blu ray playback it runs smooth

Also the Intel card does bitstreaming without hacks compared to my old flawed ATI 5770 that required a EDID override.

So basically I ripped out half the parts and replaced it with just a new motherboard

In return I get a cooler and quiet HTPC

Plus my HTPC runs 24/7 so I figure this will save a bit on the powerbill.

But I find it amazing my first generation computer I used on board s-video as it support direct 9.4c as I need that for the program's i was running.

Then I went to using video cards to handle playback etc.

Now I'm back to a onboard video that can handle HDMI 1.4v and bitstreaming without a issue.

Having a HTPC has costed a bit over the years

I think the main issue in the past is my budget was tighter so I have settle for lower end parts.

Now I think I have that solved I think this current setup will be fine for six or seven years.

1327644921.0,oytcj,Anyone using an HTPC and intending on using Windows Media Centre with their tv tuner will experience this,cheapdrinks,4,0,4,"One of the major problems I found using windows media centre to watch TV is the unexplainable delay it takes to go from windowed mode to full screen. I mean seriously anyone that's ever used it for an extended period of time will know how frustrating it is copping a good 2 -3 seconds of black screen and no sound just to get in or out of full screen. If you're using 2 monitors the problem doesn’t stop there



HOWEVER all is not lost. I found a very interesting fix for ALL of the above problems: 

1)	Open windows media centre in windowed mode (if using a 2nd monitor make sure it is on the primary one with the start button 

2)	Go back to your desktop

3)	Set any screen saver to come on in 1 minute

4)	Go back to windows media centre in windowed mode and make it the active window

5)	Wait for the screen saver to come on

6)	Hey presto, and will also swap between monitors smoothly without the stutter


I have reproduced this effect countless times on multiple windows 7 machines


It will unfortunately revert back after you close it so I pretty much have to do it every time I know I’m going to be watching TV for a while.

With Plex running on most everything (Samsung TV, Logitech Review) all I'm asking this little netbook to do is connect to the drobo and manage the library (indexing etc.) and do any transcoding.  It won't actually be playing anything itself, it'll just sit on a gig switch next to the Drobo and server out to the various Plex clients on the local network.

It took a while

GraphStudioNext - Sound mapping and routing.
PowerDVD 6 - DPL2 Filter
FFDShow(optional) - DPL2 Filter

You will also need a mic in 3.5mm port to feed your console's stereo signal. Line-in might work too but there isn't one here so we used mic-in. We use a stereo rca to 3.5mm stereo adapter to hook it up.

Install your filter either PowerDVD 6 or FFDShow. Open GraphStudio and insert you mic-in clicking Graph

So now you have these 3 boxes on your graph area. Double click the mic-in box to get it's menu. Click on the Latency tab. Give it a value of 10 and click set. You may have to raise this if you get skipping or lower if you can and want to. Next double click PowerDVD or FFDShow. Find the dolby options and turn them on

Now connect the mic out box to the either powerdvd or ffdshow in. It should auto connect the filter out to your speakers but if it didn't do that. So now all are hooked up

You can enjoy full 5.1 sound in games like RE4 and Rouge Squadron 2.

The server will be an ESXI server with Windows 7 running on one VM

My end goal is a single box that will receive streams of live TV from the Ceton card/device to my 2 TVs, and tie in with Hulu/Netflix/whatever else I am wanting to use. I want a single box for uniformity sake. I have used Plex before with great results, but it does not (as far as I know) integrate with Live TV. XBMC seems like it does, but I haven't seen anything about how WELL it combines everything - and I would have to find some small PC or device to load XBMC onto for each TV that will perform all the functions. And WMC will do the Live TV, DVR, and my saved media - but I know I will end up converting a LOT of my media (such as MKV files) since they're not supported - and I don't know if Netflix/Hulu/etc tie into a Windows Media extender too well (like the Ceton Echo).
