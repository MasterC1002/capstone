Well on Saturday I logged into my bank account to find my car note came out 10 days early.

I had to cut my vacation short

I did find someone who paid for my gas to get here

So long story short

Edit: I have an interview on Tuesday for a job I desperately need.

Edit 2: I'm a dude.

Edit 3: Wow

Edit 4: Mcbullseye saved the day!  I'm on my way home :)  I cannot thank all of you enough.  You sir deserve [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N0YCWX0FL._SL500_AA300_.jpg).

Edit 5: WarLizard is awesome too.  Thank you for attempting to help.  I owe you some reddit gold too.

Status: I made it out of Arizona.  I'm currently at a loves off of 10 filling up.  I pulled over to sleep some last night.

Status 10:31am Mountain Time: Stopped at a McDonalds in Las Cruces, etc.  Dug into my change jar to buy a mcdouble and a mcchicken.  I'm 11 hours away from home now.

Status: 11:17pm CST 4/16/12: I made it home.  I have never been more happy to be home than now.

I thank all of you for getting this noticed.  

McBullseye: I gave you my card.  You told me to pay it forward, or need/want that money back call me.  I am VERY grateful.

WarLizard: You deserve my gratitude also.  I left for home before you made it



There is nothing worse than feeling like you were just scammed

I made it to Dallas.  The pic here is geotagged.  Also

The car payment came out because I had it on autopay

Things can turn around for me quickly because for the past 5 years I've been self employed working under the name Dallas Computer Techs.  Business has been very good up until about 6 months ago.  After I went through all of my ""buffer"" money 3 months later business picked up just enough to scrape by

Before I came to reddit, or anything using Craig's List.  I ended up in Phoenix because I found someone needing to go from San Diego, to Palm Springs, to Phoenix.  They paid for all the gas to get this far.

Have you ever had such a bad week that you just want to get away from it all?  And if you do it always makes you feel better.  That bad week has been last month for me.

I have 3 close friends that would've done something for me if they could.  1 of them is incarcerated, in hindsight I should've, but it is hard to get a hold of her sometimes.  And my mom is a trophy wife to a guy who does not approve of my lifestyle because he is uber christian.  (I'm bi, have dated dudes and girls before, and he knows this.  Also getting a divorce is an abomination also.  And to make things even better, I'm atheist.)

I bank at First Convenience. (I'm changing them ASAP, it's a 4 digit number, I don't know it because I've never tried calling them before, and I have to goto my bank to reset it.  To my knowledge there is not a First Convenience in Arizona.

I am very ashamed I had to ask for help.  In no way was I trying to ask for a handout.  I was prepared to earn it

I'm extremely dumb for going on that trip.  A ton of things could've happened.  My tire could've gone flat.  My car could've broke down.  I could've fallen asleep at the wheel.  I am willing to except the fact that I made poor plans and poor decisions

His hous caught fire and is completely gone on Saturday morning (News link below). This kid has seen tragedy after tragedy man. He is a smart kid and deserves so much better. I just got off the phone with his mom
He lost all of his clothes, all of his baseball gear, his game collection and his collection of cards just to mention a few.  He is a kid man.
So here I am reaching out to anyone and everyone. Notice I am not using a throwaway for validity reasons. I would like this to get visibility. Any ideas or cross posts. I want to help him out as much as I can. I can ensure you
  I have all of his sizes and such if needed. PLEASE REDDIT COME THROUGH FOR THIS KID!!!    
  http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/story/22098653/2013/04/27/family-escapes-burning-scottsdale-home-flames-spread-to    


  UPDATE: I am at work. When I get a few moments I will respond to everyone. You guys seriously rock. Thanks you so much. THE BOY is a great kid and does not deserve this bowl of crap life handed him.    

  UPDATE: I just walked in the door
For those that think there is something in this for me, and when one of us needs help we should do our best to try and help, even if it is encouragement or words. That is what we are supposed to do. THANKYOU GUYS!! Talk to you soon.    
  
  UPDATE: I just got into work and I will be able to go through Reddit. Last night we were very busy. 2 kids had games
Again, I have 4 kids 6yo girls, 8 yo boy, 13 yo girl and 14 yo girls (she goes to school with BOY, they have been friends and he has been hanging with us since we moved her 3 years ago.  
  UPDATE: My wife is going over and taking pics now. He is in school and than he has track until 4
  UPDATE: A lot of people are sending me nasty grams. Sorry man, plain and simple.

  * UPDATE: Sorry it has been a day. We were  extremely busy yesterday. I am reaching out to community resources as well, I did not know what to do, so I did the one thing I know, Reddit. There is a reason I used all my real information and not some throwaway. If you look through this thread and look at a link or 2 I posted, it will not be too hard to figure out my real information. Google the hell out of me, I have not been shy about leaving a foot print. But just understand I am trying to do something good here.  By the way he is 13 (he just says hes 14 because his bday is in July.
To answer some emails and such I have gotten this. ""Why are you doing this, you know that one guy, the small one, who jumps out and help the person push it to safety and check on them, that's me. That guy who notices u dropped you wallet or card and I immediately get you attention, that's me. I see someone down I help them out. If I se someone getting bullied or taken advantage of, I step up, I hold the door and say please and thank you. I have respect for authority and my elders.  
Another reason. I had an alcoholic lush of a mom who walked out on me when I was 6, I moved to the UP to try and finish high school. As I remember parents weren't so understanding and were not fast to accept me. I was staying in garages, sneaking in windows, all so I could go to high school every day.  I have had nothing in my life handed to me. I lied when I was 16 so I could work nights at the foundry, yes at 16. It was then I realized I had this skill nobody else really had, I could rock a computer, it just all mad sense. So that's how I made myself. My wife and I do NOTHING on credit (Probably really cause we couldn't get it if we wanted as that all went to hell in my twenties when I was trying to survive). MY Mom did eventually come back and we made a menz when I was 17, I would go years with out seeing him. I did not even visit him on his death bed, maybe this kid just has something special and deserves so much more. Google me to hell Mike Slomanski.  

 With all that said here is what we received so far from Reddit: 

* Dominos Gift Card from AstroZombie138 (Thank you so much


I know we have gotten offers, Like most of you we live pay check to paycheck, which we are between atm. So picking stuff up is very hard, I will try to arrange a day this week. I am open to suggestions. I am open to people stopping by to meet him personally. We are a close family, I have 4 kids of my own. We have normal family problems, for those who google mapped me, I RENT, as a matter of fact I think I am behind on every bill. Again we do not do credit

What we got from Neighbors and me:

* I got him a futon and air mattress to sleep on
* An old CRT 24"" TV I picked up at a rummage
* 1 pack of boxer briefs 
* 1 Pack of socks
* A Pair of shoes 1 size too big
* A neighbor gave him $50.00
* A bicycle I fixed that was laying around.


Now as you can all see, but that is yet to be seen or known.  
  Of course I know how generous Reddit could be
  Also
  Another question I get asked, he seems to like that.

What could he use:
* Teenage boy stuff, he like to go out and be active
* Toiletries (You know like Axe, shampoo)
* He could use a pair of shoes that fit (10)
* Sizes are 32x32
* Clothes are always good
* Games
* He loves baseball
* I really want him to play RISK
* I know he doesn't need it
*Any thing else you guys can think of
*Like I said I live paycheck to paycheck and now have a family of 7, gas card, electric cards are a big help at the moment (I always give back)
In lieu of cash I would ask you send him gift cards or something
* Anything else you can think of for a 14 yo boy (He finally told me yesterday (I am 13
* I have an old ass XBOX but it has the Red Ring, that would be awesome too and he could just have it.

I do not want to put a picture

Again My Name is Mike Slomanski, I do not care, nor do I have anything to hide. I am trying to do what is right and what I would hope anyone else would do. 

If you want my addy or phone number just message me or hit me on FB. Thanks again everyone

Facts:

* Last communication with him has been at 5:30 pm Monday.
* He was out of water at this time and had said he had left his shirt behind at some point.
* Search and Rescue are looking for him. I know there has been a helicopter with a heat sensor and a dog also used in the search and rescue.
* The police have said that his phone has been turned off or ran out of battery around 1:30AM Tuesday.
* He is a 34 years old.
* His name is Chris
* **Updated map:** He had **left from the ""A""
* He is a very inexperienced hiker/climber.
* He is not familiar with the area and likely would not have followed established trails.
* He is the father of two daughters.


Suggestion/Plea:

* If you are a hiker or climber in the Phoenix Area with experience
* Please x-post this to any sub-reddit you think may help.
* I will update this when any new information is discovered.

Thank you very much!

Lucas

**Update 1**: Thanks so much for everyone willing to go out there and help in the search. I do think that Chris may have hard time assessing the real risk of situations. So that could have influenced the decisions he would have made regarding whether or not to continue hiking/ or make a climb. I would like to clarify that I would only ask experienced hikers/climbers to aid. I do not wish for anyone else to become injured or lost. S&amp;R has stated that they cannot have untrained searchers in the field. As of yet

**Edit 2**: Updated map with last known location. Ship Rock &amp; Geronimo.

**Touching in**: There is no new news yet and S&amp;R think it may take a few days to find him.

**Update 2**:
&gt; Thank you to everyone helping look for my husband, a rider on horseback and about 14 people on foot. They are trying to get a s&amp;r team on top and they plan on working through the night. Chris walked 3.5 miles to the mountain and told me he was not taking any trails. As much as I want him home with his family, please don't attemp to climb if you aren't experienced. 2 s&amp;r volunteers already got hurt and I don't want anyone else hurt. I know chris has the following items on him...a lighter, mace, his HTC phone (battery is dead), a dull hunting knife, a cannon cool pix camera and he was wearing black gym shorts with a thick red stripe down each side of the legs and black dc shoes. I believe he was wearing a baseball hat as well. He is 5'8 and 120 lbs. He doesn't have a shirt on (he took it off during his walk to the mountain and lost it on the way) but he has a dragon tattoo on his bicep, asthma being one, thoughts and prayers!",t5_2qmpu

The gold Tahoe that hit me then pulled past me on the right side and took a right turn. He did not stop. He made a U-turn and hit another car in the process. Went north on Lakeshore. My wife phoned 911 and I followed. I had two little  5yr. old girls in my truck. The guy drove back through the school zone, both in tears and shaken up. They had the same school shirts as my babies.  The guy let them in the house

TL;DR: Drunk guy wrecks 3 cars picking his kids up from school on a Monday.Keep your kids safe even in a school zone.

I need help or advice; I don't have a family to turn too. My nearest relative is in South Carolina

It seems every where I turn for help is for drug addicts or mentally ill people and I don't have either of those problems and would rather avoid that living situation(ie: worried I'll get hurt or my stuff will be stolen).

As Americans

Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting a revolution of any kind.  In NO WAY do I advocate violence!  We can

This is not a partisan issue.  In this fight, no atheists.  This is not a fiscal issue.  There is no Tea Party, no Occupy.  There are only Americans.

This is not about the right to bear arms.  This is not about equality in marriage.  This is not about healthcare.  This is not about controlling the border.  This is neither Pro-Choice nor Pro-Life.  This is about our right to privacy.

I need to find Roy Arteburn

He went missing about 7 hours ago. He was traveling alone to Phoenix Arizona to visit with his granddaughter and Great Grandson. He got on the flight in Houston, but he was not picked up by my niece or her husband. Please Please Please call the authorities if you see him or have seen him. 

He is about 5'10""

He traveled to Phoenix today (2-22-13) on United flight 339. 

Please share this with all of your Circles

I know there are lots of people that have connections PLEASE SHARE SHARE SHARE this as someone may have seen him and can help. 

THANK YOU!!!!!

Edit 2 w/ update:

We still don't have visual confirmation of him being in Phoenix except the account of flight officials saying they saw him on the plane and get off. After that, he bought a flight out of Phoenix with his credit card, set to leave around 8:30am the next morning (2.23.13). Again, we don't know if he actually bought the ticket or if someone stole his information. 

We know that there are cameras around the airport but as of the last time I heard

I personally have called several hotels in the area

Edit 3 family update:

His credit card was used 2 hrs after he landed to book a hotel and after 4 hours it was used to book a flight. This was all done while family and police were searching and looking at the terminal. We have family waiting by the terminal for the purchased flight to see if he shows up. This all seems suspect as he always provides itineraries for all trips and notifies all of us. We are hopeful that he has just been a little forgetful instead of someone else using his ID and credit cards.
We have checked hospitals and hotels close to terminal- no luck. We also contacted United Air and asked that they have him contact us at check in .
We are all praying it was just a ""senior moment"" and he will show up.

Edit 3: [xd0nn4x points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/184opy/psa_to_all_those_who_enjoyed_the_color_run_check/c8bm7wn) that the website may have changed recently and there may have been a popup that asked you to 'confirm your email' which is where they hid the fine text.

So my proposal is for people to try and post things that **Give** something to anyone reading it, a cool hangout, etc. Often I hear that people don't have anything to share, and I think that's bull. The Valley is huge, and we all have different views on it based on where we live, what we do, our hobbies

Make a goal of *once a month posting something new in this sub, but if everyone made just twelve posts in 2013 that gave something out to the community, this could be a crazy good board by the time we circle the sun one more time.

Either way

&gt;A friend of mine alerted me to a gentleman who's missing and was last seen Sunday in Phoenix. [Please pass this link around to as many people as possible to see if we can help!!!](http://www.sciencequeen.com/daveposter.pdf)
&gt;
&gt;Thank you!
&gt;
&gt;Edit: More info: Dave McMillan
&gt;He is from Vancouver BC. He was down visiting friends and disappeared in the middle of the night without his wallet or passport. He might have his phone on him but it doesn't work in the US. A missing person report has been filed.
&gt;
&gt;**Edit 2** From nomoon_
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Friend of Dave here. Here's the whole swack of information compiled from the facebook group where people are communicating about this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**The situation:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Dave DJ'd at a party on Saturday.
&gt;&gt;* He went back to his friend's house afterward.
&gt;&gt;* His friend left the apartment Sunday evening
&gt;&gt;* When his friend returned
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Things we know:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* He left behind everything: wallet
&gt;&gt;* He was last seen near the corner of E Southern Ave and S McClintock Dr.
&gt;&gt;* We don't think he had any money
&gt;&gt;* His phone does not work in the US/his carrier is FIDO.
&gt;&gt;* His laptop cable is missing
&gt;&gt;* He was wearing a red shirt and black cargo pants the last we saw.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Things that have been tried:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Tempe and Phoenix police/jails have been called. If the police had him for longer than 1.5 hrs, with no ID he could be lost in the shuffle (ie. using a different name or refusing to give one). (Aug.23)
&gt;&gt;* Hospitals called: Maricopa Medical, St. Joseph's on West Thomas Road, Banner Good Samaritan, Banner Baywood (Aug.23)
&gt;&gt;* The Canadian consulate has been contacted 
&gt;&gt;* Local news has been notified.
&gt;&gt;* A missing persons report can't be filed until he's gone for 48 hours (1:30 am Wednesday)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks to everyone getting the word out in the Phoenix area. Since Dave is from Vancouver BC, being so far away.

Earlier in the week, we discovered a similar love of travel, just for the sake of travel, among many other interests we shared.  We both have a spontaneous sense of adventure, so when I asked what I should do on my upcoming days off, I was given the following task:

**“A question and a mission for you

So now I have homework.  How could I show everything I love about my adopted state and city in just two days?  I moved to Phoenix from the east coast last year, I’ll post photos I’ve taken those two days, plus other photos I’ve taken over the past year.

If I woke up, would I be able to recognize it?  Well, what unique sites does Phoenix have to offer?  What if I was dropped off in the middle of the desert?  Several states have deserts.  Hell, I could be in California, Nevada, or New Mexico, as well as others.  What makes Arizona unique?

We do have beautiful desert scenes after all:

There’s so much more I could post, the arts scenes, Native America, etc.  I’m no professional photographer, and most of these photos were taken via camera phone, but what I’ve learned is it looks like I have much more exploring to do.

1353249835.0,13edp6,Help my friends family find their stolen necklace,,35,7,9,"I'll give some back story first. I was friends with Frank since we were 12 years old. We literally were never apart. Even when we grew up we were at each others births of our children, and he told me how he was driving his truck the weekend before and jackknifed it on a road near Flagstaff and about got killed in an accident. I told him he needed to stop driving and find something safer. Half joking

Then a week after we went out this happened:

http://www.azfamily.com/news/local/Man-dies-after-getting-pinned-between-two-delivery-trucks-in-Phoenix-101659468.html

I was devastated. His family was devastated

We had the funeral and his family had him cremated. They chose to have his ashes seperated into 4 places. One was spread out at their family cabin near Heber. One part was kept in the urn at his parents house. And the other 2 were made par of a piece of jewelry for his parents each to wear. His mom had a locket with a picture engraved into it with a bit of ashes placed in it. And his dad had a necklace made that had a vial of his ashes in it with a dragon on it. It was Frank's favorite mythical creature. I was with him when he got a giant one tattood on his leg.

Fast forward to this summer and this happens:

http://www.azfamily.com/news/Priceless-necklace-stolen-from-Phoenix-couples-home-179735131.html

I know the people didn't know that they were stealing something so personal but it doesn't matter. I've watched a person who I consider to be my second mom go through the emotions again of losing her son. I've watched my ""other"" dad cry and stop by several pawn shops every day for the past few months looking for the necklace. They've pretty much moved out of that house now that they lived in for 40 years. Junior's room

I'm asking people to put the word out about the necklace and help them get it back. They mean everything to me and when I watched the news story I couldn't help but go through all of the emotions of Frank being killed again. And that's nothing to what his parents feel. They're DEVASTATED again. Please help them find it by putting the word out. If you see some jewelery either out and about or at a pawn store

We are trying to get in touch with them about getting the sketch of the necklace, please contact Phoenix Police at 602-262-6151. You can also text a tip to Silent Witness at #274637

Please keep an eye out. It won't bring frank back for Frank Sr. and Susan

Again, but I've browsed this sub for a while and you all seem really nice so I figured I'd ask. Right now I am a 20 year old guy, about to start my education and have my whole life ahead of me, and I want to set my sights on moving to AZ soon. I flew into Phoenix and went to hike the Grand Canyon a few times over the past few years and ever since my first time, I've fallen in love with the state and cannot see myself living anywhere else when I 'become an adult,' so I'm really thinking hard now.

So, and am looking to start getting my associates degree this summer. I work full time right now in a manual labor job, but that combined with taking classes, I should be done my Associates in less than two years, focusing on computer networking technology. 

Now, maybe help-desk work, tech support, anything like that (and I'd do my best to get certifications on the side too). That would hopefully be good enough to get started no matter where I am located, so I figured why not do it where I want to live anyway? So, I guess what I'm asking is, how difficult would it be for me to make the move to Phoenix and essentially start new?

Even if I didn't get a job in IT right off the bat, and save up enough to get more schooling at a school in the area. Or maybe the associates/work will be enough as is. So what is the cost of living like? That is, for a 20-something? Ideally of course, I'd get a job in IT, so does anyone have a general outlook on the job market there?

I know that a lot of people might advise against it for some reasons, I've visited before in some capacity, and that is one of the aspects I look forward to most, the outdoors! Of course summers are brutal, but one thing that sounds great is the fact that you can drive north for a few hours and there are amazing hiking opportunities, and camping, rock climbing, I am just so excited about moving there

*EDIT: Also, so what kind of jobs could I look for that I could get without a degree? Anyone able to support themselves on 'regular' jobs? For some reason I've always thought I'd dig the hotel industry haha, or work in a bookstore or something random like that. Any suggestions?

1328118937.0,p6dtu,My paycheck came up short this month... Does anyone have oddjobs(anything) that are needing to be done?,,29,4,42,"**UPDATE!!!** [I cant thank you enough!](http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/p6dtu/my_paycheck_came_up_short_this_month_does_anyone/c3ncsad) I was just paypal'd money to cover what I needed. I can't begin to thank you all enough. 


**To those of you I have planed to work with:** I still want to do the work for you all. But! If you know of anyone who can benefit from it more (thanks to an amazing person)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am 24/m

I am happy to do anything. I don't have a truck so I can't haul stuff. But I can do yard work, cooking, computer repair/building/etc, courier, chauffeuring (DD anyone?!) I love all animals (I'm pretty decent at training dogs), random handy man work, and anything else (within reason; grossness is not a factor!). 

*(more info in the edit below)*

I currently work part time and my schedule is very flexible.
I pride myself in the work that I do
I have a car so transportation is not a problem.

If you could ask friends and family if they need help with anything I would totally appreciate that!

Thank you all for reading. I truly hope something comes of this. (read: need)

Have a great day!

**Please PM me


**EDIT:**

I figured I'd post some of my responses from below and from PM's

* I can usually cover my bills, and put me out of work for a bit. I don't mean to give you my sob story.(I didn't put it in my original post for that reason.) 

* I just did the math. I'm just shy of needing $150

*  I would say that I am great at cooking. I didn't go to culinary school or anything

* For computers, upgrading, troubleshooting, consulting, consolidating, organizing, media server setup, similar to what I've done with pc. I am very familiar with the ins-and-outs of each of their operating systems. Same goes for the iPhone as well(anything and everything) (ps. I have friends at Apple stores what are always helpful). I started to learn programming but I much rather enjoy teaching people on how to better use their computers (people usually not found on reddit

* Current work: I work parttime for a company that contracts with food manufacturers to do their vending work and other various projects. When working

**Extra Info:**
Times that I am not available:

mon/wed - nights (5:40pm-9pm)

tues/thurs- mornings (8:30am-9:45am)

Other than that

My work schedule is on a 'just get it done when you can' schedule

We have 1 month before the end of the year

**Note:**  These are *nonrefundable* tax credits.  I'll explain toward the end of my post.

[Working Poor Tax Credit](http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/WorkingPoorTaxCredit.aspx) is a dollar for dollar credit (up to $200 for single filers

[Public School Tax Credit and Private School Tuition Tax Credit](http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/SchoolTaxCreditsforIndividuals.aspx#public).  These are 2 separate credits even though they are listed on the same page.  There is no itemization requirement for either credit.  The Public School Tax Credit is a dollar for dollar credit up to $200/$400.  The Private School Tuition Credit is a dollar for dollar credit up to $1

[Arizona Military Family Relief Fund](http://www.azdvs.gov/benefits/relief_fund.aspx). [Donation Form](http://www.azdvs.gov/Departments/MFRF/MFRFDontationForm2012.pdf).  Maximum credit is $200/$400.  No itemization requirement **but** only the first $1 million donated to the organization is eligible for the tax credit.  As of yesterday over $595

Basically what you are doing with these credits is directing what organizations/programs/schools receive your state income tax.  Donate $200

**Nonrefundable Tax Credits** are tax credits you only receive if you pay tax.  The tax credits cannot reduce your tax liability for the year below $0.

[Earned Income Tax Credit](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/EITC-Home-Page--It%E2%80%99s-easier-than-ever-to-find-out-if-you-qualify-for-EITC) aka EIC.  This is a **refundable tax credit** available on your federal return.  Even if you have a $0 tax liability for the year

Here's the great thing about the AZ tax credits:  They're all deductible on your federal schedule A as charitable contributions.  You can lower your federal bill while paying the same in AZ.  This effectively decreases your overall tax payment.

This list of credits is simply to help you identify where you can benefit the most from making contributions.  I do not want anyone to think that I'm trying to redirect their donations.  These can be used in addition to any giving you already do every year (if your cash flow allows).  Purely an informative post that I wanted to put together.

I just wanted to post an update! So it looks like this story will have a happy ending! We're fostering him for the time being. He has since warmed up to us (pretty much within a few hours after we got him!) and he doesn't seem scared at all! He's pretty much a big puppy! I think he was abandoned or something because he seems to be well-mannered (aside from typical puppy behavior like chewing and jumping). He knows how to sit and he seems to be house-trained also.

My cousin has expressed some interest in adopting him and told me that he'd let me know for sure after he thinks it over for a few days.

Well I kinda of have a way for you to do both. I realize most people will brush this off if it's too long so I'll keep the important stuff short and then add the rest after. Also this is a self post

Basically I'm about to be in between apartments for a couple of weeks starting on the 31st of this month. I'll be staying with a friend who has cats so I can't have my dog with me there. The one person that could watch her bailed on me and I have no one else I could crash with while I try and hustle up the money for a new place. I'm already going to be losing a lot of my belongings due to lack of money/nowhere to store my things

I have no idea what breed or age my dog is. I found her nearly dead on the street and nursed her back to health. You can read about it [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/lnnc5/this_is_danger_girl/). It never got much attention but the little info I did get from the post helped me in bringing her back to good health. She's amazing with people, fully potty trained, and quiet. She's sincerely the best damn dog I've ever had. She's my everything. She was just what I needed in my life. Oh, and her name is Deneva Dangerfield.

I'm in a tough spot because I have no car, a place to stay, or a place to keep my things. All I want is to know that someone out there wouldn't mind taking care of the most important living thing in my life while I try to get said life back in order. 

I'll post additional info about her in the comments so that my initial post isn't so long that it deters people from giving it attention.

Working on uploading some pics now

So I ask you


UPDATE: Hey guys! I just wanted to thank you all for your kind words and support and let everyone know that someone was kind enough to take my little furball for a bit while I get my life together and get settled into a new place! I'll be updating again once I get her back and get settled into my new place with her! I love you all and thanks again for being so great. Stay classy

Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027

In appreciation

I've been in AZ for almost 3 years. I work a standard 8:30-5pm job in N. Scottsdale and therefore would prefer to stick around the area. My current roommate is moving in with her bf at the end of this month so this puts me in a situation that i need to find a place to live. I've lived alone in AZ as well as with roommates. Both in big apt complexes (Legend at Kierland as an example) as well as rented from a condo owner that rented to us (nar PV Mall). I'm respectful

I'm looking to either rent a room w/ bathroom and all that good stuff or something along the lines of a duplex/ studio attached or detached. I've come across some gems on CL (NOT.. ok they weren't THAAT bad but still) but nothing that i'm willing to say 'i'll take it' to.

The room is 10x10.5 and has a private bath, restaurants and shopping is also nearby. The house has a pool, three car garage, laundry room, laminate floors downstairs and newer carpet upstairs. Rent includes access to the whole house, including the 60' plasma w. surround sound and a garage space that can fit a small car, or any extra furniture/stuff you have.


About us: my long-time girlfriend and I own the home. We are in our mid 20s and love cars, doesn't go on furniture and stays downstairs. So you must like dogs and are open to a roommate who has a dog, so long as your pet is also well behaved and gets along with our dog. Cats unfortunately are not OK due to allergies (blasphemy, I know). 


We are looking for either male or female roommate who is a student or also a young professional. We are gay friendly and OK with alcohol and having friends/significant others over

Rent: **$600** and includes private bath, water, internet and garage spot.

We started calling her Beardy for the gray fur around her mouth. My girlfriend and I noticed that when she would eat she favored one side of her mouth and despite getting regular food she was very skinny and never seemed to put on weight. We were finally able to capture her and take her to the vet who diagnosed her with [FIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus), normal appetite. We brought her back from the vet and we're currently letting her live in our guest bathroom while we administer antibiotics and feed her wet food in the hopes that she'll put on some weight.

Here's where our request comes in: the vet is recommending that all of her teeth be pulled

**Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get help for her?** We've contacted two rescue groups but have received very little response. Are there any other groups who might be willing to assist?

We've covered her initial vet bills and are willing to get her spayed and vaccinated. We're happy fostering her for the time being but we have to keep her separated from our other cats. [Here's her info from the vet.](http://imgur.com/rzKHpfA)

We're confident that she would make a great companion for someone who understands her needs. She's still a little shy around people; she'll hiss once or twice as you walk up to her but she's never acted aggressively toward anyone. She loves being brushed and will start purring as soon as you start petting her.

Buy mini bottles - throw in liquid baggie thru TSA checkpoint - purchase (2) soda pops from in-concourse concession shops - dump out some soda from each - pour liquor into each - pack in carry-on bag/carry onto plane in my hand. (Throw away mini bottles before boarding flight.)

Moving to your city around June and had a couple questions. I’ll be working in Midtown Phoenix (near Thomas and Central) and I like a more urban lifestyle

1) The 3 apartment complexes I’m looking at are Roosevelt Square

2) I firmly believe in the work hard/play hard mentality. The buildings I listed above are all near light rail, I used to live in NYC (92nd and 2nd) and would occasionally make the .7 mile walk home from the subway at odd hours of the night while hammered. 

3) I’m open to other suggestions if you have any. I’m 26 , but that’s not absolutely mandatory.

I'm fostering a beautiful dog that was saved from the shelter who was about to be put down - he was on the euthanasia list. 

He is a great dog! 

He walks very well at my side on the leash, and does not bark at other dogs  - even if they are barking at him. In general, he doesn't really bark at all. 

He is super cuddly! He loves to be pet and will put his head in your lap for love and affection. 

He is still young and a bit of guidance is still needed

I currently have him in my one room apartment and the poor guy is way to big to be in here. He gets along great with my cats (doesn't bother them at all) and my 5lb. min pin - whom he is also too big for. Because of this I've been having to crate him more than I'd like to.

I'm really hoping he finds a home ASAP! The adoption place I'm working with has an application

A while back I asked /r/phoenix if anyone could house my car for the summer. That ended up not working out due to my schedule, as of today it still hasn't, meaning I will be car-less when I arrive in Phoenix on August 12th. 

My original plan was to drive from Phoenix to Bagdad on the 13th

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to drive me from Phoenix to Bagdad on August 13th. [Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=phoenix+az+to+bagdad+az&amp;oq=phoenix+az+to+bagdad+az&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i57j69i62l2.3932j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) is a link to the drive. Two hours

Plus side? You are driving to a small mining town, and extra. I'll even buy you a meal at the town restaurant.

Down side? You will be driving out two hours, but it'd be on the floor of the trailer I'll be living in, since it will be completely unfurnished.

Again-- two hour drive one-way,,False,self,t5_2qmpu,False,,True

I'm looking for assistance finding work. I have been unable to find work in the Phoenix area

I was in the Naval Seabees and was stationed in both Puerto Rico and Okinawa.

I think my lack of job history has been hurting me here. It has been nearly 6 years since I last had a job and I've been in and out of school in the meantime.  While attending classes i helped someone move and injured my stomach and back and i just found out that i also have a neck issue that more tests will reveal exactly what is wrong. The VA nor my schools have been able to find me work. My school/studies are leaning towards Medical Administration

Can any of you recommend any other places I can try? Do any of you know anyone that's hiring? I've tried everything from fast food to technical support type jobs and no one will hire me. I'm desperate. Nothing has been working out and it has been dragging me through the mud.
