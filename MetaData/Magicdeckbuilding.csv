1367300453.0,1de85p,[Standard] Mono-Green. Went 5-0 and won FNM! (Yes with a mono green deck),Aroh,46,2,15,"I know we have somewhat been seeing more attempts at mono-green lately

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-green-10-01-13-1/

Let me explain how FNM ended up going:

Match 1: I won in two against a Rakdos/Falkenrath deck. Didn't really ever give me trouble throughout the two games. In the first game I got CHampion of Lambholt on turn 2 and then an Increasing Savagery and it was over. Second game I got an Ooze out early with a rancor and again it was over.

Match 2: This was surprisingly more difficult than anticipated as it went to 3 games. It was against a younger player (possibly 12 or so) and he was playing a Black/Green deck with Desecration Demon. Unfortunately for him

Game 3: Won in 3. This is when things began to get intense and REAL. Played against an American deck. Honestly I wasn't feeling too confident going into this match

Match 4: Against Reanimator Won in 3. This guy I was playing was quite confident. He explained that I would be able to win game 1 but after sideboard no way I could win game 2 and 3. Little did he know about Alpha Authority (like he honestly had no idea I ran it). First game I got him down to 1 health but then he stabilized and I lost. Second game was really insane and will never happen again. But in my opening hand I had an alpha authority, increasing savagery and rancor. I decided to keep. On turn 3 I ended up alpha authority on arbor elf and a rancor and figured Im going to go all in with the Arbor elf. I eventually pulled another Increasing Savagery and by something like turn 7 I had a 22/20 Hexproof, Trample Arbor Elf (remember flashback on that spell), game over. In game 3, I eventually got a alpha authority on a Champion and a bunch of other creatures. The game got really close but I ended up lasting long enough to put an increasing savagery on Champion and then swung with like 7 creatures for the win. The guy was extremely rattled and annoyed by Alpha Authority and just couldn't believe he lost.

Match 5: Won in 2. Not sure the name of the deck type but it was the classic Thrag/Resto/Angel of Serenity trio that I just love! First game I got an Ooze and then the turn after I put an alpha authority on it he summoned an Angel of Serenity. I had already done half damage by the time he summoned it though and the Ooze was able to finish him off before he could kill me with the Angel. The second game was much like the 3rd game in Match 4

Overall it was a super fun night and nobody could believe that I had won with the deck. The staff at the LGS asked if they could see my deck and see how much it cost online. They deduced it cost around 60 dollars,,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,True

Quit whining, you'll have access to a number of ways to control how many (or few) cards you want in your graveyard. 

As far as sculpting your graveyard you've got Memory's Journey in BUG or Harvest Pyre in Jund colors. Serene Remembrance, so they'll fit in either side. Toss in something like Mulch to make sure you're hitting your land drops, and you've got the trappings of something potent.

1370586804.0,1fujbn,"5 tribal decks that needs to be in perfect balanced. ""Part 1 Template""",Testbot5000,16,0,15,"Hi guys

I apologize in advance for the wall of text and English is not my first language so sorry about that.

When I was in high-school I used to play MTG every day but as I got older my friends stop playing and eventually so did I. Now that I'm older and have a bit of cash I decided that I am gonna build 5 house decks (one of each colour). What do I mean by house deck? its simple just decks that I can play with my house guests.



**Ok here are the parameters:**

1) They have to be balanced. This very important!! Take note I understand that some decks will counter others but one cannot be stronger/weaker than all the other decks.

2)They have to be tribal decks(elves

3)Most importantly they have to be fun to play with/against. If a deck is really good I have found that it can kill a player under 5 turns i don't want this.

4)Not to weak but not to strong. Partly because of managing rule 1 and 3 I should build them a bit weaker but if they are to weak that's also no fun.

5)[Not to put nine cards in.](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/magic-the-classroom-the-rule-of-nine/) For the sake of diversity I will only add 2 of each card except for 2 creatures that will have 4 in (I will call these my core creatures)

6)60 card decks with no side board.




**here are the tribes**

Blue Wizards: This will be a control deck to lock down your enemy and slowly chip away at him

Black Zombie deck: Death plain and simple. Kill your enemies creatures and overrun him.

Green Elves: Swarm and Overrun.

White Soldier: Call to arms

Red Goblins : Hit fast hit hard.

I actually don't like the Goblins (It feels like I'm Six pooling like a noob) Is there any other Red tribes that has more of a burn element? And the elves are cool but I would like a power house green tribe any ideas?



**Ok and finally we get to the basic template I am going to use for each deck.**
 
a total of 22 Lands : 18 basic lands  and 4 special lands

a total of 8 Instants/Sorcery:  of which there will be 4 (two of each)

a total of 4 Enchantments: of which there will be two.

a total of 28 creatures: 8 of which will be my two core creatures and the rest will be 10 creatures of which there will be two of each.

What do you guys think? any advice? Do you have other recommendations for tribes? Is my mana to creature ratio ok?

**Thanks** in advance
I will update when I start building the first deck Thanks.

1333127115.0,rl591,Friday March 30th Deck Tech,flox44,16,1,6,"More building on a budget this week.  I try to keep the cost low so you can build the deck for *around* $20.

This week we'll be talking about [U/G Self Mill](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/march-30th-budget).

UG self mill is a powerful draft archetype for Innistrad, and then end the game with cards that benefit from having high creatures counts in your graveyard.

Our mana base is somewhat shaky on two colors, it is very important we have access to green mana in our opening hand, so 11 Forests should make that happen every game.  Islands for our mostly 3 drop centric blue needs.  Splashing 1 swamp for flashback. Since we can't afford dual lands and we need to make sure we have 2-3 colors on demand, we need to tutor them up with [Evolving wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262680), this gives us 4 cards we could draw to get us a swamp or any other mana fixing we need. We want to get our lands early and really don't want them later, evolving wilds also filters some of the lands out of our deck making it more likely for us to draw the action we need or mill creatures when we need to.  

We need to have a good start to our game, [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221892) is perfect for us.  Extra creatures to put in the yard when we don't need it, and accelerating our mana to help us get ahead.  [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213728) is another elf to help us out.  He helps us agro/stall, and uppon death fixes our mana and filters our deck.  

Our big ticket item in this deck is another mana dork, even with our lower density of other color lands BoP helps us stay on or ahead of the curve.  Just like our Elves we don't feel to bad about sending these to our graveyard since they become more fuel for our big win conditions.

[Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=237012) is our last bit of mana fixing.  It both enables our self mill and puts mana in our hand.  While mostly an early mana fixing card setting up our curve

We have a few looters for hand correction and graveyard fuel.  [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220179) helps us out by both helping us fix our hand and filling our graveyard with everything we don't need.  [Civilized Scholar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221209) is another looter

We also have our draw/loot with [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226758), the blind mill is usually sub-optimal but we really need that yard full, and his high toughness helps stall the board out until we can get some win-cons down.

After we've filled up our graveyard our win-cons come down and usually win very quickly.  [Boneyard Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220050) is a potentially very big beater, but the static stats makes it more resilient against graveyard hate and can potentially hit play sooner.  [Splinterfright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227301) is both a beater and an enabler, and with trample he can't be chumped, just be careful from the uncontrollable self mill you don't mill yourself to death.

[Kessig Cagebreakers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249868) with sufficient creatures in your graveyard just wins games instantly.  Unfortunatly Cagebreakers also has to attack

[Skaab Ruinator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230780) is a controversial card in Self Mill decks.  To play the skaab you need to remove creatures from your graveyard, it's still a creature in your yard.  If you *really* need a creature out to deal with something, or just need another body to swing in when you're out of gas, casting the Ruinator from your graveyard is a plenty good fallback plan.

This deck is definitly not in optimal form, and it's pretty functional.  You need a good start, you've got plenty of hand correction down the road, so knowing when to mulligan is very important.

Yesterday I went to a (slightly less hardcore than FNM) weekly standard tournament with my homebrew Izzet counter/burn deck. It was bad


First game I went up against a Nico Christiansen Naya Humans, Champion - T2 Temple Garden, Champion, Boros Elite - T3 Sunpetal Grove, Burning Tree Emissary into Burning Tree Emissary into Mayor of Avabruck. My single Augur posted his letter of resignation... 0-2


Second game was really fun actually


Third game was against a UB control semimill + Aberrations


Fourth Game was basically the only close one, grisly. First round I countered his 10/10 costs 1 less for each card in your gy only for him to play 2 boneyard wurms turn after. Second round I won turn 4 with T1 Delver, T2 Searing Spear + Flipped Delver, T3 Guttersnipe, T4 Pillar of Flame, Searing Spear and swing for the win. Third round I get screwed and stomped. 1-7-1


I didn't expect to do well, but now I want to focus on improving the deck.


-3 Electromancer nah


+1 Guttersnipe he's aight


+2 Delver just too good on turn 1


-1 Talrand I got to play him twice and he always got killed before he could trigger


+1 Think Twice


I'm not so sure about the Augur's, what would I put in? I never got to play the epic experiment and I will not take it out until I have :D

As a fallback to turn on *Bloodthirst* you can pay 2 life first for 1 directly at your opponent.

[Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208251), why turn down the option for extra free damage when the situation arises?

**2 Mana Creatures**

[Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220277) is a wonderful little human.  Turn on bloodthirst and he's a 3/3 on turn 2.  And unless your opponent is willing to throw at least 2 creatures in frost of this axe wielding human he's unblockable.  

**2 Mana Spells**

[Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206343) is a nifty little spell.  Kill two creatures, it's there to spread some pain.

[Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234075) is a standard burn spell.  It's no [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234704) but in decks desparate for more burn it isn't a bad choice.

[Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235600) is your artifact hate spell

**2 Mana Artifacts**

[Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218018) is your late game answer, that's a buildup of (on average) 2 damage a turn whenever you're ready to crack the shrine.  Against a control matchup this is an invaluable card, and in any other aggressive matchup it's your trump card once the board has stabilized.

**3 Mana Creatures**

[Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220298) is a big threat for you.  A 2/2 hasted flyer is already good.  You trade with Delver, and with your high density of burn spells and reliance on them once your have a suitable board presence you'll be seeing this card over and over and over again.

**3 Mana Spells**

[Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214381) is an awesome card for your deck.  It's Incinerate damage, Turn 3 both Stromkirk and Stormblood Attack.  As they attack you cast Volt Charge for 3 damage wherever you need it (to a creature or to their life) and proliferate the +1/+1 counters on Stromkirk (up to a 3/3) and Stormblood (up to a 4/4), you now have 10 damage on board coming in at your opponent.  That's potentially half of their life in 1 turn.

[Brimstone Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233253) is another incinerate with bonuses.  If you have *morbid* up (which is very likely with how agressive your creatures are) then you have 5 damage for 3 mana ready to go.

**3 Mana Artifacts**

[Sword of War and Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214368).  What deck isn't made better with this?  evasion in the mirror matchup or agressive White decks.  And it helps you burn your oponent down

**4 Mana Creatures**

[Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214028) is your big finisher.  Battle Cry to buff your dudes, so that means no cump blocks coming out.  that's a lot of damage on board coming at your opponent.

**4 Mana Planeswalkers**

[Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212238) is your buddy here.  Not only do you get a 4/4 every turn to beat with, or a second burn spell Koth has your back.

But if you're expecting to do well when you go to a FNM at your local comic books store

I have been playtesting my [R/W deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/c3h7cooh-rw-deck-copy/?category=type&amp;submit=Go%21) for about 2 months now, trying to get a deck to work, that simply can't.  Here is why.  R/G Gruul ramps faster than you, their ability to play BTE, into a Mayor (if they are human naya), or a Flinthoof-boar, or a lighting mauler, it gets faster, and have a decent amount of life cushion over you, the post is don't go boros aggro.

Another thing that is working against you is assuming you can play Battalion.  Which assumes that now only can you get 3 creatures out on the field, and most humans are 1/1 or 2/1, even something as low cost as a tragic slip will ruin any plans you may have had.

White is all about protection, so really what's the point? Also while I love the mechanic of the silverblade paladin, and frontline medics, the 3 cost makes them difficult to play without having someone remove them.  So again you can run cards to protect them, but then you start inching yourself out of aggro, and into midrange.

If you want to run aggro, and cards which more useful mechanics than battalion.

P.S.  If you are going to ask for advice on your aggro deck, fix your mana first.  It's an expensive upgrade to be sure, but waiting a turn to play a card, only puts you further and further behind.",,False,,False,t3_1a81a7

So the last couple weeks, and Obzedat who just wins games.

It plays sort of midrange-y/control-ish, however, has a serious issue with aggro decks.  They can often get under me before I can draw anything to stabilize (I main boarded the Verdicts and Blind Obediances last night specifically to deal with aggro).

I'm just not sure what else I should do to deal with aggro without moving my deck too far from its current play state.  The side board probably needs some work too.  

Curse of Echoes, Dissipate are included for control decks but often I don't use them as my main board doesn't have much of a problem with those decks.  I'd still want to keep curse and dispel for decks running Sphinx's Revelation.

D-Sphere is for token decks and for Planeswalkers.

Feeling of Dread, Devour Flesh are more spot removal for creature heavy decks that give mine issues.  Murder is there basically to take the place of Ultimate Price for Boros Reconers or other troublesome multicolored creatures.

Vampire Nighthawks were an addition I made last night after going 2-2 at MNM

Last week, as you may have noticed, literally all of the money in this deck is in the three Snapcasters (which to be honest, is pretty mediocre in this deck, I'm still trying to figure out the right number of them, the original deck I played against had none).  It's worth noting that Snapcaster is only 7.5 tickets on MODO, and this is directly following its winning a tournament as a 4-of

So I decided to build the deck.  I went hunting for a list!

...

...

Nowhere.  Apparently this budget guy I played on MODO is the only person playing this deck.  I already had the Snapcasters and Delvers

That jank fits into this deck well.  Each spell has so much versatility.  Many cantrip, Unsummon, and Mizzium Skin all do important things.

I fully expected to get my ass handed to me.  But I didn't.  I haven't run it through a daily yet, while awesome, seemed like a bit of a glass cannon.  And it is, but this can be mitigated with some smart play.

The key to playing this deck is simple: Take risks, there are few things that will be able to block them.  

KNOW HOW ALL THE INTERACTION WORK.  Study the list.  You can Dispel your own spells, then flash it back and exile it when you flash it back.  Unsummon your Snapcasters in preperation of flashing back Mizzium Skin if removal is their only out.

This deck is ALWAYS THE BEATDOWN.  You are the beatdown against monored.  You are the beatdown against zombies.  

This deck has some incredibly disgusting matchups, and the decks you can beat every time are: decks that run creatures.

Well not every time

PS You maintain priority as long as you have a Nivmagus on the field in MODO automatically.  Nice touch Wizards

This is an obvious attempt at extreme budget

So

The basic game plan is to live long enough to cast Havoc Festival, Get hit with Havoc Festival yourself (Which shouldn't matter, because as long as you aren't a 1 life you don't die).  Pass.  Then after Havoc Festival triggers during their turn (they go to 5, and it's before they draw) cast an instant that does 5 to the face for the kill.

The living long enough is the tricky part.  Mostly this is achieved with the indiscrimate killing of creatures.  Tribute to Hunger is a real hero in this deck

And right now

So on to the deck:

http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1057824

Now the plan here is to gain control of the game

Curse of Death's Hold seems particularly good at locking decks like zombies out of the game as it just stops Blood Artist Gravecrawler and Falkenrath Aristocrat.

One of the nice perks of this deck is invulverability to most removal.  Yes Demonic Taskmaster will probably just each a removal spell.  Still not completely sure about him.  But he's such an undercosted beater, he's resistant to Pillar of Flames, which is the most played removal spell in the format right now.

What this deck is missing most is a good source of lifegain.  Tribute is fairly good at doing its job (gaining life and killing Geist of St Traft) because it has so much help from other removal

One of the the other things I really like about this deck is that it gives you a bunch of quality utility cards for the price you are paying.  You get 2 playsets of Dual Lands, and 2 Planeswalkers for your investment.

Improvements for the deck mostly involve fixing the manabase

The sideoard is a work in process, since Nicol Bolas still rolls to a Detention Sphere, which I expect to be popular following the Todd Anderson's win at the SCG open this past weekend.  Right now, it looks like Dreadbore is faily underplayed, even by BR zombies, who much prefer additional .

The end result is pretty far from something I'd play

**1. Submit your own budget decks**
Here are my arbitrary rules (and feel free to discuss them)

a) The deck must require both red and white mana, Crimson Muckwader is not.

b) The deck must come in for less than **$30** for all cards.  Be sure to mention which site you use to evaluate your prices.  **Note that the price evaluator on TappedOut.com next to the 'coolstuffinc' ad is inaccurate** and does not match coolstuff's prices.  

c) The deck should be reasonably playable.  Maybe not tournament-worthy

d) The deck should include at least some form of 'budget bomb'.  Magic is more fun with splashy cards.  Try to find something you can put in that is fun to draw and play.  (Note: doing so may result in not being able to put in full 4-sets.  I leave it to the discussion board whether or not 1 Hellrider is better than none).

**2. Vote on other people's decks**
Just give an upvote if you think something is good, the exercise will help some of the newer people understand why we make some of our decisions.

I don't like being limited to just a few sets for them since I've come across some cool cards to trade and individual cards at a card shop. 

Lately, 3, even 4 play sets for their decks. It gives them a clear advantage but also an overwhelming sense of satisfaction when I kick their ass.

I could use some help.,HamsterBoo,11,3,1,"I decided to make an arcbound deck of about 20 colorless cards. Then I can throw in 20 lands and 20 other cards that could drastically change the way the deck plays

Right now my base is 3x arcbound workers, 3x darksteel juggernauts, 4x prototype portals, 2x mycosynth lattices, and 2x energy chambers. I keep most of the arcbounds rather low mana cost because its so crucial that I have multiple in play at all times, and prototype portals give me an endless supply while giving me lots of flexibility with whatever other artifacts I throw in.

I've made a blue/black proliferate deck out of it [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ub-arcbound-proliferate/) and wanted to hear what people thought.

[Here is my current deck](http://deckbox.org/sets/197046?) *(Note: The sideboard isn't complete

I took suggestions from other decks and created this and have been tweaking it ever since. I haven't lost with it versus my friends

**Concerns I have**

* I removed a few high costing spells and added in 4 [Highborn Ghouls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=242503). I'm wondering if this brings my creature count (24) too high. I feel having Intimidate will help me avoid creatures with protection from black from blocking me.

* I think I have too many creature removal spells. They definitely have helped in letting my creatures attack unblocked, at least to my sideboard. I don't know what other type of spells I should have for this type of deck.

* 22 Lands. Since my highest mana cost is only 4

* Sideboard. I currently don't have one. On my deckbox I have a few ideas for cards listed on there that I think could work well

**Goal of my deck**

The basic goal of my deck is to get out many low cost Zombies in order to overwhelm my opponent quickly

1331325814.0,qpd3t,Deck Tech Friday March 9th,flox44,10,1,8,"&gt;Tempered Steel

Tempered Steel is an (almost) mono-white fast agro deck building around an amazing [Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129572).  With very early (several on 0 mana) and very aggressive creatures

[Here's](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=2563&amp;d=216642) a fairly standard Tempered Steel decklist and the subject of today's Deck Tech. This is the W/g variety

**Lands**

With an extremely shallow curve, mana can be fast and loose making room for more action in hand.


[Razorverge Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209407) is the first non-basic land.  Using a Scars fast-land over [Sunpetal Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221923) is optimal, coincidentally, another land.  [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233242).  While costly to activate (requiring at least 5 lands under your control) it gives the deck some late game viability should it get there.  And with the low color commitment of the deck, being unable to produce colored mana isn't a big downside.

The W/u version of Tempered Steel runs [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209399) instead of Razorverge Thicket for the access to blue.  And like Gavony Township the splash is almost entirely for a land

[Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213731) is the last non-basic land.  Few decks aren't made better by including Inkmoth

**Creatures**

[Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194078) is your 0 mana shock trooper.  This little walker is the beginnings of your early aggro strategy.  With the abundance of 1 drops, but with the synergies in this deck it's a lot more than just a cheap beater.

[Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213773) is a potentially huge source of damage.  Battle Cry makes every agressive move you make that much more powerful.  And with his pseudo-flying you should have battle cry up during every attack step.  As your forces grow larger so does the impact of battle cry.  And better yet

[Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217984) is another big impactful 1 drop.  You have no black source so you will always be paying the Phyrexian 2 life cost to cast this flyer.  Very likely you will be gaining that 2 life back through lifelink.  2 turn attacking, and helps with burn based matchups.  

[Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=215099) can be another good beater for you.  With Metalcraft turned on (should be often with your high density of artifacts) he's likely unblockable and immune to damage from colored sources.  It can chump with no fear of destruction

[Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206358) is your first non-artifact creature, and allows for some shenanigans as the game goes on.

[Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214064) is the topper for your curve.  A 4 mana beast in this deck.  Battle Cry to help you swing for the win

**Instants**

[Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218072) is your go-to removal option.  When Metalcraft is on this is one of the best removal spells you can run.  even without metalcraft you can still use this to tap down a threat to allow more damage in.  Knowing when to dispatch your opponent's creatures is extremely important

**Enchantments**

[Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194391) is the card that lends it's name to the deck.  When this bad boy hits the field, Vault Skirge starts gaining you plenty of life every turn, Signal Pest starts doing damage alone, etc.  All of your artifacts speed up their clock, and make blocking and attacking very difficult for your opponent.

**Artifacts**

[Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208248) is some mana fixing for you.  Even though you're running 20 lands, Memnite, Signal Pest, Mox Opal. you then have metalcraft up allowing you to tap opal for a white mana, then play Glint Hawk bouncing Opal back to your hand, the play opal again and tap it again for more mana and play another Vault Skirge. That's 7 damage ready to go on turn 2, not even RDW can match the explosive potential of Tempered Steel.

[Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194049) is another beater for you.  With your high density of action cards, you can just pay the 1 mana and animate it for more artifacty flying beats.

[Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=210239) is a nifty card for helping you get card advantage and interacting with Glint Hawk Idol.  By dropping the spellbomb for 1

1372145479.0,1h0xij,[Casual] Homebrew Duel Deck: Phyrexia vs Eldrazi,Viltris,8,0,3,"(cross posting from r/magictcg to a more appropriate subreddit)

So Phyrexia vs Eldrazi has been an inside joke for a long time now. And I wanted to flex my Johnny muscles and not spend too much money, but I didn't want to look at other people's homebrew duel decks and bias myself.)

Phyrexia: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/homebrew-duel-deck-phyrexia-vs-eldrazi-phyrexia/ Eldrazi: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/homebrew-duel-deck-phyrexia-vs-eldrazi-eldrazi/

In the spirit of duel decks, and at most 1 of anything else (other than basic lands).

The first major decision to make was should Phyrexia include New Phyrexia or just the classic Yawgmoth era Phyrexians. A quick poll with a few friends came up classic Phyrexians, I specifically decided not to repeat any cards from Phyrexia vs Coalition. Not all of my picks are flavor homeruns, but as far as I can tell, none of them are flavor fails either.

The Eldrazi deck would obviously be a ramp deck, and Phyrexia would just roll over Eldrazi. Not enough evasion, and the Phyrexia deck would just get stalled.

So the Phyrexia deck's game plan is to stick creatures and beat face until it wins. In the late game, Morinfen, and Phyrexian Snowcrusher to help it win. Sure, none of these are ""good"" cards, but they're just good enough that, left unanswered, will tear the Eldrazi apart.

Your removal suite consists of Rathi Trappers (which tap down both big Eldrazi and blockers), Big Game Hunter (takes down big guys), and Vile Requiem (an early Vile Requiem is pretty disgusting). Phyrexian Etchings helps you refuel when you run out of steam and makes for some interesting play decisions.

I previously tried sticking in Volrath, Volrath and the Scuta just kept running into Eldrazi Spawn, and the Phyrexian Delver just didn't add enough aggression to the deck. I also tried including more disruption, in the form of cards like Ostracize, Addle, and Psychotic Episode, but I quickly discovered that those cards whiff more often than I liked. Ravenous Rats is the only remnant of the disruption sub-theme in the deck. I also tried adding p/t boosting auras like Unholy Strength, and Phyrexian Boon

What about the Eldrazi deck? Since the Eldrazi come in red, and I didn't want overlap, the Eldrazi ended up a red-green deck. Which is good, because green provides the ramp, and red provides the burn. To make things flavorful, I limited myself to only Zendikar block cards. Not everything is a flavor homerun. For example, why are Ondu Giant, Frontier Guide

In any case, and cards that fetch land. Many of these ramp cards also provide bodies that can play defense (or offense if Phyrexia is wide open). Worst case scenario, you can always chump block with an Eldrazi Spawn. Broodwarden pumps your Eldrazi Spawn and frequently leads to ""surprise, I win"" moments.

Your finishers are The Big Three, Momentous Fall turns them into cards and life.

For the burn, rather than a ""surprise, I deal lethal with a giant fireball"". That said, I'm considering swapping out Momentous Fall for Comet Storm, since Comet Storm can serve as both removal and an additional win condition.

So after a week of tweaking and a few hours of playtesting every day, but not to the point of mindlessness. Because the decks are mostly 1-ofs and 2-ofs, the variance is quite high. Sometimes, Phyrexia aggros out and rolls over the Eldrazi. Sometimes, Eldrazi ramps into a fast Hand or Crusher and stomps Phyrexia. Sometimes, there's a lot of back and forth, and both decks play their bombs, the power-level between the two decks is pretty close (although I think Phyrexia has a slight edge).

So let me know what you think. Feedback? Suggestions? Thanks!",,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1h0xij/casual_homebrew_duel_deck_phyrexia_vs_eldrazi/

* I did have Boros Reckoners in instead of the Delvers

* Delver.  I've never played a deck with him

&gt; Pro: He gives me an additional win-con (three in the air is tough for most decks to deal with consistently) and will flip reliably.  

&gt; Pro: He's a one drop in an aggressive deck that is missing one drops.

&gt; Con: Skylasher.  A big f-you to Delver.  Will decks actually be running it?  Only in SB?

&gt; Con: He's only got a 2 butt.  I'm worried about aggro decks blowing me out - would Auger of Bolas be the better choice?


* Talrand - I'm back and forth on adding this guy.  Seems like an additional win-con

This deck is great against the aggro matchup because 9 times out of 10 I can get out a chump blocker to respond to immediate threats. If you get to Turn 4 you just explode (I won a game last night with a T5 Corpsejack Menace swinging in as a 16/16) I have a few problems with the control matchup but unless they're countering everything I can usually swing through for the win.

Primordial Hydra can end games on its own. Having a Corpsejack out makes things more ridiculous. Side in Bioshift for shenanigans after your opponent declares blockers. Revenge of the Hunted has saved my skin on multiple occasions.

My only concern is against the Bant Control (Thrag/Resto shenanigans) matchup. A T5 Thragtusk hitting the field poses a real problem for me. Throw in Resto Angel and suddenly my opponent has a significant life advantage.

&gt;Start by constructing two decks
&gt;_**Oldschool slow:** 20 lands/20 Creatures/20 Spells._ Commons are best
&gt;**Creatures:** Vanilla is better, but hold off on activated abilities until later. CMC curve should be 4x1/8x2-3/8x4+  
&gt;**Spells:** Sorceries and Enchantments; only stuff that can be cast on each player's turn. No instants/interrupts...yet.  
&gt;**Lands:** 20 basics.  
&gt;**Sleeves:** Attractive to your new pupil.  
&gt;Do yourself a favor and don't make either of these decks blue.  
&gt;_Make a third deck using the same rules that runs two colors and slightly more land. You'll need it in a few nights._

&gt;[An example in White](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/w-trainer/)

&gt;After a few games or even a few nights of playing
&gt;Now pull out your simple two-color deck and have at it for several more games/nights.

1) While Quirion Ranger is a very important card

2) Garruk's Companion

3) Maybe lower Bounty of the Hunt from 4x to 3x

4) Vine Dryad seems outdated

5) I might want another enchantment instead of Might of Old Krosa. Spider Umbra, but I'm not sure which one.

6) If I don't want another enchantment

7) Silhana Ledgewalker seems great

8) Jungle Lion also seems nice, Bounty, and Garruk's by 1x each and add 3x Jungle Lion?

9) I've always considered Winter Orb essential

10) Some of the Hidden cards seem interesting. Hidden Spider might be good on the sideboard (does it work against Delver of Secrets?). Hidden Guerrillas seems VERY good against artifact decks.

11) Memnite gives the best power to manacost ratio out of any creature I have

1330714470.0,qesoz,Deck Tech Friday March 2nd,flox44,9,2,7,"&gt;U/W Delver

U/W Delver is a midrange (agro-control) deck and works in the spirit of Tempo. Tempo is all about generating advantage and then pressing that advantage to win. When you force your oponent to play defensively

Today we'll be looking at Jon Finkel's U/W/b Delver Spirits deck that took him to the top 8 in Honolulu. You can find a [decklist here](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event? e=2518&amp;d=216330). While U/W/b spirits will be the focus

**Land**

With a fast and aggressive deck on a very low mana curve the mana base has to be equally fast and aggressive.

[Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209399) is a true all-star here, it's still a dual land and helps to fix any complex mana base.

[Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209400) is effectively an Island in the basic land count. The only real purpose for the black is for Lingering Souls Flashback. Even then

[Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262680) is a great addition to this deck

[Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233239) is a great source of utility. Thinning graveyards against reanimator decks and creating spirits for you. These 1/1 flying spirits are another toolbox of versatility. They can act as weenies to chump

**Creatures**

[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226749) is the card that lends its name to the deck. With the high density of sorcories and instants even without a ""Ponder"" setup it has about a 1/3 chance of flipping right off the bat. Once flipped this [""the fly""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/) homage is a real threat. As a 3/2 flyer it puts your opponents on a 7 turn clock by itself.

[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227676) makes every blue deck better

[Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220099) is your toolbox card. Legendary killer, meaning your illusion can hang around and not worry about dying to targeting (similar to Image copy [Lord of the Unreal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220131).

[Drogskol Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244773) is your spirit lord.  This is mostly for pumping your 1/1 spirits

[Dungeon Geists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249875) Tops out your curve at 4 mana.  He's a decent body for damage

**Instants and Sorcories**

[Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244313) is possibly one of the most important cards in this deck.  Using ponder to set up a Delver flip.  Searching out whatever card you need.  And shuffling away when you can't find it.  It gives card advantage

[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233056) is another card advantage spell.  For 2 life you get to peak at your opponents hand, or are holding on to [triple Galvanic Blast](http://youtu.be/UipZNYQpZvo).  Best of all, it thins your deck allowing you to find those cards you need a little bit faster.

[Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262695) is the reason for the black splash in this deck.  Getting 2 spirit tokens is great, or can chump when you're getting beaten on.  When compared to [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221214) the sorcory speed isn't as much a drawback as having the cheap flashback is simply amazing.

[Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249373) is the first in your suite of control.  Bouncing an opponents' creature and doing a little damage

[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241831) is debatable the best counterspell in standard.  Since this is a fast deck rarely will you need the hard counter that [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241985) offers

[Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194123)

**SIDEBOARD** 

The sideboard in U/W Delver is really to help you control the board a bit better.  You have a medley of removal to board in against different decks

* 1 Phantasmal Image 

* 2 Dungeon Geists 

* 1 Mana Leak 

* 1 Revoke Existence 

* 2 Gut Shot

I've whipped up this fairly budget homebrew deck that runs great against decks I run in the current format. The deck is aggro focused, and Viridian Emissary. If I don't happen to ramp up my Dungrove and pop a rancor onto it to win, the deck does well with the 8 one and two drop undying creatures (Young Wolf &amp; Strangleroot Geist) pummeling down with the pump spells (Mutagenic, Hunger of the Howlpack, Rancor). Late game I'm rolling Garruk, Thragtusk and Vorapede.

In the sidedeck I have Ambush Viper for aggro decks (looking at red), unblockable, etc.), Vines of Vastwood if I'm facing some type of creature control.

I'm not looking for any major changes to the deck (although I am open to suggestions!), but haven't been able to get one from any LGS. I felt like running over 21 land would be too much, maybe 20 would be okay, as I have Harrow, Llanowar Elves, and Viridian Emissary.

1366289611.0,1clpaz,[Casual][Modernish] Azor's Pillowfort,philoponeria,7,0,1,"Hi. Thanks for reading this. 

**[Problem Statement]** My current playgroup is casual. Currently the deck field is not DOMINATED but flooded by what I've taken to call Isochron Izzet. U/R, counterspell, with worldfire/cyclonic rift thrown in. All games are at least 4 people, 2 headed Giant, Emperor or Assassin being the most common. 


**[Solution?]** [Azor's Pillowfort](http://deckbox.org/sets/317117). My intention is to deny as many of the goto cards as possible and win via the Elocutors. I THINK this would work as long as I don't come up too early as a target. I've never really tried a deck like this before so i want to know if I'm missing anything that would be great. I would really like to get rid of the scepters as well since that is what I'm hating against the most. The ""sideboard"" is other cards that I've considered.

This deck is based on a Laboratory Maniac/Alchemist's Apprentice deck I came up with. This deck, can be run as either a one-turn-mill offensive deck or a LabManiac win deck, can justifiably run cheap token generation (lingering souls), and should be versitile enough with a proper sideboard to avoid most major shutdown tactics.

Strategy:

Simple. Angel of Glory's Rise to return a Fiend Hunter(targeting the Angel), return the Hunter to play with the now entering Angel, rinse, repeat till opponent has no cards in library.

Alternate Strategy:

Self mill with the same combo till all of your humans are on board. Swing until win.

Alternate Alternate Strategy:

Side in Laboratory Maniac. Combo with self targeted. Win. (Given

Other Notes:

Most of my non-creature spells have Flashback, Detention Sphere, Psychic Spiral, and Merciless Eviction all offer decent answers to those annoying cards that cripple the deck (Rest in Peace, Tormod's, Slaughter Games, etc). Lingering Souls offers a cheap front line to block or attack Planeswalkers or highly defensive players. Archaeomancer offers a poor man's Snapcaster, like Supreme Verdict.

I took a [GU deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/-simic-gimmicks-/) to FNM last week and went 1-3, and even a monogreen fast ramp deck.  I was hoping that splashing into black mana would give me more staying power with hard removal like Abrupt Decay and Dimir Charm while at the same time cutting situational cards like Bioshift or Pit Fight.  With the addition of Vampire Nighthawk, lifegain can give me some buffer against faster aggro decks, and I can use Golgari Charm  to answer control decks' sweepers (maybe siding out Simic or Dimir Charms in game 2).

I thought a lot about Corpsejack Menace, I didn't want to exacerbate the problem.  Especially since if I did put Menace in, I would likely cut Vorapede or have to add in Farseek -- neither of which were particularly appealing.  

Adding Dreg Mangler was also a choice about board presence.  The 3 drop he replaced was Elusive Krasis, Dreg Mangler has good Scavenge targets with Gyre Sage, Master Biomancer, and Vampire Nighthawk, and has haste.  Much more immediate board presence.

The Zameck Guildmage and Ooze Flux has fantastic synergy with my Undying creatures

Hey guys. I cam here not really knowing what to expect but maybe looking for general advice to getting started. I started playing the game as the title states a few days ago. I noticed a few friends playing since I travel a bit with a group and they did it so I caught on fast and one of them let me use their deck for a day or so (Red - Goblin, with some sorcery and enchantment. White a few bit of white cards in there to compliment the goblin spam. Commander something where X/X is based off creatures in play. Anyways the deck ended up being like 130+ cards plus, cause I just couldn't figure out what to pull and what to keep. I have left it untouched since day two and played with it. It plays pretty alright. Though a day or two I went back after reading and spending a lot of time with friends and have now built a 65 white angel deck. Mostly evolving around Exalted with lifelink soulbounds. I have 4 5/5 angels with flying vig ofc. And the 4/4 angels. With the avatar that is dependent on your HP ETC.


Anyways I find myself rambling. But the people I play with have been playing for a long time. And I ask them frequently what I should do or what kind of deck should I shoot for? Most of the time it goes unanswered while we move onto another topic. Does anybody have any advice for a new starter for a deck to start on? Cards to focus on? Stick with one deck learn some tact? I mean I am looking for scraps here since nearly everybody else around me is flying with high colors and crates full of cards. They all offered to help and said pick out cards and stuff if I would like to use them and what now. But looking through ALLLLLLLLLL THOSE CARDS. I just have no idea what to do..

Though I understand how powerful cards like Snapcaster Mages are

[Here's the horrifying abomination on Tappedout](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/everyday-im-shuffling/)

Basically

1. [Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46582) is the easiest of the two win conditions. The second one hits the field, or get out one or more Soldier of Fortunes, and this can burn surprisingly fast.
2. [Cosi's Trickster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=186322) is the backup to Psychogenic Probe. It gets +1/+1 every time an opponent shuffles, if you're playing it right, it could be both. 

As far as I can tell
The All-Star of this deck that is the #1 best engine behind the win conditions is [Soldier of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3182). He's the #1 best engine in the game for forcing shuffling

The best part about this deck is that it costs about $16. So, you can get the dumbest Legacy deck ever conceived. Whaddya think, Reddit?

I just started working on my rush of the wild event deck. It's one of the first decks I bought and it is save to say I am pretty new to the game so im not rly sure about the power/combo power of certain cards in the deck. 

This is the deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rush-of-the-wild-official-event-deck/

I named it like that because as you can see I have not yet changed anything. But I would like to change some stuff.^^ 

First I will start with the cards I wanna throw out:

-Rakdos Cackler: I doubt I will be able to play it on a first or second turn because of the obvious lack of mountains in my deck. Also if I had the choice I would always go with the Elvish Mystic. 

-Gruul Charm: The deck is in general not very good against flying stuff. The Gruul Charm won't change this so I put some of those in the sidedeck and I will just lose game one and then change cards.

-Wrecking Ogre: High cost for 3/3 and also high bloodrush costs. Is this justified by the double strike?

-Armed Dangerous: High costs for what it does. 


Do you agree with these cards being not the best and also not being essential for the deck strategy? 

Now the replacements: 

-Savage Summoning: I was thinking putting this card in the main deck maybe also more than once. 

Annihilating Fire: Maybe also more than once. Of course I have to pay attention to not putting to many spells in. 

Wild Beastmaster: Because its an essential card for the deck I think only one copy is not that much. 

I was also thinking about adding more copies of Rubblebelts Raiders Pyrewild Shaman and Ogre Battledriver. I have to watch out that the avg. mana cost is not too high. Also I thought about putting in 1 or 2 additional Burning-Tree Emissaries to get it to ramp harder. 


Would be nice if you could give me some advice and just say what you think. 

Thank you.

To my mind

Thragtusk

Supreme Verdict

Aetherling

Farseek

Sphinx's Revelation

These seem to be the essentials, and verdict/sphinx's being at 2x-4x.

Supporting cards include garruk relentless, azorius charm, selesnya charm, snapcaster mage, advent of the wurm, voice of resurgence, loxodon smiter, sigarda, detention sphere, acidic slime

Matchup considerations:

Aggro: Farseek into Verdict is obviously great against many aggro decks. Azorius charm is good for stalling

Reanimator: Syncopate/dissipate are good at permanently handling unburial rites or hardcast creatures. Selesnya charm is also good to have when they do drop large reanimatables at instant speed. Thragtusk helps to keep up with lifegain while you hunt for aetherling. Usually not a great matchup, and ground seal as options.

Jund: Sigarda and aetherling are very reliable win conditions against jund. Loxodon smiter helps handle discard effects

Aristocrats: Supreme verdict is good against cartel aristocrat, architect can put off a lot of their attacking power with his +1. Selesnya charm and azorius charm both hand varolz well.

UWR Control: This matchup can often be an aetherling race. Cards like thragtusk, selesnya charm can provide some tempo advantage during the race. Cavern of souls can help to resolve aetherling. Advent of the wurm, loxodon smiter, and voice of resurgence can provide early pressure to tie up their resources during the midgame. Jace is excellent against assemble the legion.

Supreme Verdict: useless. I never casted it once if I had it in hand. If you need it in this deck

Trostani: WHAT A HOUSEEEEE. She got so much work done it was insane.

Sigarda: A bit disappointing.

***MVP***
UNSUMMON: That card did so much work in tempoing my oponent out of being able to kill me, etc. And I would still probably take it over Az charm because its cmc1, but some testing may be required there too.

1370134394.0,1fhsqr,[Standard] AEtherling Control Budgeted ~ UPDATED,Orzhov,6,2,0,"http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/therling-control/

Feel free to ask me anything about the deck/matchups!
First i would love to see what anyone would change with this deck.


So I've gotten to play at FNM and a free tourney for standard with this deck.  FNM I went 3-1-0, and some of the negate/dissipate/essence scatter/render silent were different (i did 2 negate and 2 essence for main)  Overall i feel it plays the same.

MATCHUPS:
Matchup 1: 
was a UWr control (the same as found on star city that won on sat i believe) ~ This was an easy matchup, i ran out out and let it get countered.  That gave him ease and he tapped low thinking i would not have another.  I played a land and won from my second one easily.  The second game i knew his board and what I was playing and boarded in my 3 dissipates and 2 negates, and out my board wipes.  Same scenario, i won from AEtherling quick enough.

1-0-0  (2-0)
Matchup 2:
A weird enchantment deck using about 33 enchantments

2-0-0  (4-0)
Matchup 3:
Golgari
It had lilliana and viraska
This match was creature light on her behalf, (my mistake i had an aetherlingout and wasnt paying attn) and she seperated into my 1 aetherling, and my lands. I kept the AEtherling, and next turn laid a land, and was able to squeeze it out with aetherling without her having mounted any creature presence.

3-0-0 (6-0)
Matchup 4:
Short but sweet, i had 5 mana but only one white, holding a supreme verdict. Likely wouldve had an easy win if that had been used on turn 4 or 5 (i didnt miss a land drop)  Game 2 was similar however i did get a supreme off, but he managed to topdeck a few spike jester or 2, and i missed my land drop to get to 6.  By that time, i was at about 5 life and he just closed the game with another haster i believe a falkenrath aristocrat.

Overall i think i had great matchups for me

a TL;DR for the free tourney is: (this is with what the deck is now)
round 1: forgot a planeswalker could ult. He did such and won from 8
Round 2: boros aggro. easy pk. similar to naya blitz
Round 3: BUG zombies?  recast gravecrawler and such.  I was able to keep him at bay
Round 4: Junk reanimator
This was the hardest.  Found my deck to be horrible against it

TL;DR ~ Very fun deck. Has a 70-30 good match ratio i think.  Needs some tweaking


EDIT(s):
Please ask me about any suggestions i make and a deeper reasoning.

If people were to make this into an even more competetive deck that is not QUITE the norm

First of course is mana: Remove the guildgates and add Glacial fortress'/hallowed fountain.

Second: Add snapcasters (2, incase they drop a planeswalker, since this has NO removal for that other than the sphere of course.  The snapcaster element helps with the tempo-ing of it, and of course give you a great deal of control around turn 5-9, when you dont have enought mana to drop an AEtherling.  These turns can be VERY crucial in this deck, when you might be low on cards, and don't have a sphinx's rev (will discuss later) or you do but for 2-3 is a small rev (sometimes needed

Third:
Sphinx's Revelations is an amazing card. If you are making this a very strong deck less budgeted, and u are running 4 aetherlings (prefereably if u have another in hand/vary by matchup) drop the aetherling.  Most decks using aetherling are waiting until 7+ mana, usually 9 (to hold a negate and a blue for exile)  I say this is doable because it is a threat, you force them to take it out that turn, which is many times using a lot of mana and gives u a free turn (remember only if board control is stable!)

-2 aetherling. -1 detention sphere

+2x sphinx     +1 ?????                 +x snapcaster.     +x dual lands


Piloting this deck:
Based on what i have it is fairly simple.  ur first 3-4 turns are used for hitting thought scour turn 1 on urself (if u have 4 aetherlings) and cycling that into a free card basically, if no scatter and playing heavy aggro use a dread, or an end turn think twice.  turn 3 is either a flashback on dread or think twice or again, holding a scatter/dissipate.  Make sure you hit your land drops. if you are playing a slower deck its a LITTLE less necessary (i generally kept if i had 2 and a think twice/thought scour/az charm) turn 4 is usually a verdict, or let them over extend and hold a feeling of dread and let them get mad and keep dropping creatures thinking 'ill get thought eventually'. turn 5 thereby can be a verdict. Following turns can be tempo-ing and taking small damage, stay above 4 life, no boros charm/helix/ spear+pillar.

Be patient. Be patient.  Analyze the plays


Things i found:
JUND: tl;dr-you can win
Thragtusk is annoying but the life gain isnt sh*t for this deck. the token is the only iffy part. Based on cards in hand and ur life dissipate or dont. 
The sphinx's rev isnt a requirement of this deck. if its too costly
Falkenrath can be a problem. Scatter worthy ususally
Huntmaster is not too bad
Usually ive found jund is a few turns back, 1 for 1 (its kinda a bad spot for them. its slower in my opinion, and if u 1 for 1 them, they fall behind slowly due to that slow fact.)

ARISTOCRATS: tl;dr can be tricky as f*ck.
This is a very board based play matchup.  know what u are playing. know what they can do and what will kill you.
lingering souls. problematic to say the least. dissipate if u can usually. they can sandbag it
blood artist: based on the board state let it hit or dont. dont let it if there are a lot of tokens
falkenrath aristocart: again its all board state. if no sac outlet

JUNK REANIMATOR: very hard matchup imo. 
If they are going for a turn 3 acidic slime
the angel...: it will not get anyhing on your side, horrible.  it doesn't need to hit! It may outrace you since you will likely not be at 20 health.
lotleth troll: ha....ha.... azorius charm it
unburial rights: well clearly this is a hard one. based on graveyard. it is dissipate worthy. watch out for it on a turn 4-5 angel, and resto or so.
obzedat. this is a game loser really.  You cant do anything unless they attack with it

UWr control (close but different mirror)
you can win. their burn is not enough to kill you. they get dead cards, spear me, pillar me, just be smart when dropping the aetherlings, if they tap out for a sphinx, go for it. they have no removal that is truly scary against it. you should have 7 mana,  no rush.
warning


EDIT 2:
The sideboard is NOT worked out. it worked for me
Renounce the guilds is amazing. if you side board it
Negates: needed imo
Oring- maybe needed- if u board renounce
nevermore- this is certainly iffy. its socrery speed. bleh. if you are terrified about 1 card
terminus. those pesky indestructible cards....screw em.

The idea here is to put down a border post every turn, play any of the cascade spells and cascade into Restore Balance. You'll have no lands or creatures on the field, and so your opponent will be forced to sacrifice any he/she has. From there, try to get out March of the Machines and swing with your Borderposts, cascading into the last two Restore Balances as necessary. If you have lands you want to get rid of so your opponent will have to sac theirs, just sac them to Greater Gargadon while it's suspended. If they manage to make some lands stick, Ajani deals with them nicely.

The main idea behind this deck is to get as many creatures out on the field as possible. I have a few heavy hitters to ""bring the noise"" as well. Here is a link to a full deck.

As you can probably imagine, I try to get out Crusader of Ordric and Goldnight Redeemer. If I still have Roaring Primadox, I simply bounce my Goldnight Redeemer for it's life gain.  It doesn't take much after that, if I still have quite a few tokens on the field.
