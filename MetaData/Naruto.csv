Danzou and the 3rd represent the opposite polls of these three traits embodied in a person. Danzou offered the choice that he did because he knew that Itachi would choose the greater good over his own clan. This utilitarian philosophy is also distinctly and intensely Japanese. I would assume that those statues are symbolic of the nature of the choice Itachi is being presented; the same creation/destruction theme that runs throughout the series. The sage of the six paths is supposed to be the original perfect shinobi, and Kabuto all isolate themselves in pursuit of absolute power. They strive for greatness at all costs the way hedge fund managers pursue profits. Naruto embodies the same resolve

You have consider that at this time

Well

Obito: Not that high priority

Kakashi: Big one. Unparalleled genius (only surpassed later by Itachi), and with his stickling for rules he is halfway there to root mentality already, and Orochimaru at that time was just itching for Curse Seal subjects). Also observation because of his issues.

Minato: Had the team only a few years before he became Hokage. So he must already have been on the table when he got the team. This makes him a opponent to both Danzou and Orochimarus ambitions (who both aim for the hat). Having someone in his team would be invaluable for intel.

---
So now what did Rin wrong for me to accuse her of being a mole?

Well

1.) In this chapter, because RIN IS NOT ON THE MEMORIAL STONE. In the flashback, he mourned her at a nondescript grave marker. So Kakashi killing Rin was a justified action.

2.) If you picture Rin

3.) Her name. Rin. No surename. No clan (people have claimed her to be inuzuka because of her markings

4.) Her crush on Kakashi is the PERFECT cover for her observing/shadowing him. NOBODY would ever ask any question. And if she ever got his attention

5.) The big one. Is it not AWEFULLY CONVENIENT that a random 14 year old Kunoichi (who is not described as ""medical prodigy"" first) just has the training to do Sharingan harvesting and transplantation? Just remember what Danzou and Oro worked on...

I get no karma for this. This is a mod announcement post. Its very important all subscribers see it. Here is an index of the topics I will be talking about. With details before. Just for your info

1. We are looking for new mods.
2. We will begin stricter spoiler enforcement.
3. New code will be placed to help the use of spoilers.
4. The community needs an attitude adjustment. 
5. Lets work together and make an FAQ.

#####[1]

We are now looking for new mods. If you are interested in applying make sure you are qualified for it.

* Be on reddit for more than a year.
* 2000 link karma &amp; comment karma required.
* Know our rules inside and out.
* Have a previous history of modding a sub-reddit of moderate size.
* Be on reddit almost everyday for atleast a few hours.
* Be allergic to reddit drama and power tripping.
* Patience is a virtue we highly covet.
* Novelty accounts need not apply.
* Be confident in your comment history.

If you're already busy with your personal life, family, Significant Others etc etc all come first, every time. Do not try to juggle things that can't be juggled. This is for those of us who are responsible adults that are willing to volunteer doing work for free. This is not fun, this is work. Real mundane work. As much as lark makes it seem like the contrary. 

#####[2]

Starting today

* 1^st you will get a warning
* 2^nd you will get banned for a week.
* 3^rd you will get banned for a month ~ more.

Enough is enough

#####[3]

I'm going to install a new spoiler hiding method for the whole title like /r/Thewalkingdead does it. That is until I find / make something even more better. This will go hand in hand with the 2^nd topic I mentioned above.

#####[4]

I've kept my tongue quiet for a looooooonng time. But I can't anymore. I love you guys. But we really need to work on this. Just because naruto used to be about an immature kids doesn't mean we have to be immature too. Come on

1. Hating on any character(s).
2. Calling characters &amp; other users derogatory names.
3. Demanding other users to ""just read the manga"" or ""get the fuck out"".
4. Be more respectful amongst yourselves.
5. Answer simple self post questions with kindness &amp; informative instead of being rude &amp; ""holier than thou"" about it.
6. Stop posting bad quality images / links.
7. We mods are always watching

#####[5]

I bet you've noticed a lot of users ask simple questions. Questions that just get asked all the time. Lets all work together and make an FAQ. At first it'll be a self post. but as it grows I'll port it over to its own page / wiki.

Since [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/19h3kp/idea_why_dont_members_of_this_sub_reddit_fully/) became popular

I'll lay out some general guidelines and once the coloring team is formed

There are ~17 pages per chapter. I think 2 pages per person is a reasonable assignment. So we're going to have 8 people on the team, consistently. Only in emergencies should you call for a back up. This is only my suggestion. The 5 winning colorers (read on) get to decide how they run things and who else will join the team.

In order for the chapters to look good, and who does what. The back ups must be included in this discussion. Once the chapter is finished, message the mods with the imgur album. I strongly suggest that the team create a private subreddit or make an IRC to communicate in.

---

###Wait for the MangaStream release.

Do not use MangaPanda since their image quality is lower.

----

###How the team members will be chosen

There are 5 slots open (this can change once the initial team is formed) for 5 head colorers. 

People who volunteer to be a part of the team must first show their skill by coloring the bottom panel (the Uchiha ganging up) on [this](http://mangastream.com/read/naruto/19584373/15) page. 

Since I'm guessing that this thread will be filled with questions and comments, contest mode enabled) will be the head colorers.

---

A team is necessary for week to week and page to page consistency. Additionally

That panel was specifically chosen because it is fairly simple. The best colorers will be able to make even something simple look amazing. It will interesting to see how you guys handle the shading.

Good luck to everyone who decides to compete.

1368567461.0,1ecast,The Sage and his ideas,FlyingGoatee,280,36,31,"The Sage had two sons, who would go on to found the Senju

Previously in the series, Jiraiya, Hiruzen, etc. Whenever the curse of hatred is discussed, the people affected by it are always depicted as being crazy or overcome with emotion.

At least

But when it comes down to it

Despite being on the good guys' side, we can look at them and say ""They had good intentions! Their hearts were in the right place!"" Yes, we can say that about Itachi and all the others. They all meant to do good by the world. But the matter of fact is that they failed.

Power &gt; Peace is strength without thought.

Love &gt; Peace is words without meaning.

This is nothing new but you can really see how each of those characters ended up embodying that. Naruto has words but he couldn't stop Neji's death despite saying that he wouldn't let his friends die.

So we see that as the story develops, he gave the Moon's Eye Plan some credence. He made Madara seem sane for quite some time. At this point in the story, it's clear that the will of fire is an aged idea that will not solve the world's problems. It's a great thought but it lacks the strength to actually accomplish international peace. There has to be a mix between the younger and elder son's ideology.

Senju and Uchiha are constantly pitted against each other. The Senju are portrayed through Buddhism and the Uchiha through Shinto. Susanoo vs thousand armed Buddha. They do not overlap. To support the idea that the will of fire isn't the sole solution, the idea that the sage is a mix of the two shows that neither the Senju or Uchiha ideology can stand on their own. In fact, when the two ideals diverged, things went to shit and the cycle of hatred began.

But to me, Naruto won't just be the SoSP reborn, but the SoSP: new and improved. This goes with the theme in Naruto that the next generation is an improvement on the past. He's going to make the decision that will bring about a more permanent peace, one that won't spawn another cycle. 

Now, preventing them from seeing that things don't end up so black and white and that the themes don't actually clash. One of the things I like about Naruto is that there is virtually no character that has the absolute moral high ground who can boast that they never goofed. Almost every character can improve or can be improved upon through another character, even the Sage himself.",,True,nsfw,t5_2quts,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/1ecast/the_sage_and_his_ideas/

A likely scenario for this happening would be that Juubi gets into its final form, Gai makes the ultimate sacrifice by opening the 8th Gate and unleashing awesomeness. Meanwhile Lee weeps as he watches his master tear himself apart due to the strain of the power he's unleashing. Gai temporarily subdues the beast with his bare fists. And then cue flashback about how he was a loser and about his rivalry and friendship with Kakashi. Juubi fights back even harder which forces him to execute a final move even more destructive than Afternoon Tiger, one that would severely cripple the Juubi.

1368984336.0,1en13c,Just a thought about Madara (spoilers),theycallmemanolo,251,34,17,"I think a lot of people don't realize the connection between Sasuke and Madara. I'm thinking that by looking at Sasuke's path

After [chapter 625](http://www.mangapanda.com/naruto/625/19)

We also see that [Madara](http://www.mangapanda.com/naruto/562/2) and [Sasuke](http://www.mangapanda.com/93-419-16/naruto/chapter-414.html) both still at heart treasure their past. They deal with the situation at hand as they would have in the past. 

Madara probably wanted Konoha to be known as the strongest village so he challenged the strongest of each nation

Sasuke assembles a team, fuck it, there is no better time to use my new powers) and saves his comrade (Karin). 

Then there is a point where the two characters of Sasuke's and Madara's lives stop being parallel and become perpendicular to one another. I'm talking about that moment when the character sees or does something which confirms their insanity

For Sasuke it was the fight with Danzo. Danzo is on his way back to the village and Sasuke follows him. He kills Danzo in the name of his brother while almost assassinating Karin in the process. This fight brought out the worst in Sasuke

So this is where my theory comes in. I think Madara is confronted by Tobirama during this time-skip, which they probably have,but to me Tobirama gives off a ""this is personal"" tone. We also know that both despise eachother, and Tobirama sees him as a threat to the village.

So, and that all that should stop. Obviously, Madara refuses, claiming his actions are ""necessary"" because he puts fear in the other countries making Konoha the most powerful nation. Fighting ensues. Tobirama says it is all in vain, and the nations are growing hate towards Konoha (this explains why nations such as the sand and mist try to destroy Konoha, and why the cloud and stone villages almost distrust Konoha). This is probaby when Tobirama uses the Edo Tensei and revives Izuna to fight Madara. This can explain how Madara knows the technique and learns its hand seals. Tobirama is then defeated, but Madara is torn. This is when he removes all doubt

We might see this happen with Madara's version of his flashback coming soon. So what do you guys think?",nsfw,t5_2quts,False,,umadbro,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/1en13c/just_a_thought_about_madara_spoilers/

1360115820.0,17z0nq,Sasuke: The Hero's Journey (SPOILERS),The-Magic-Sword,243,33,75,"TLDR: Sasuke’s story follows the Hero’s journey


So i've been analyzing Naruto lately (symbolism


Something hit me -many of you are probably familiar with ""The Heroes Journey"" If not: (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney), that's obvious, but since Sasuke is often held to be one the series’ villains (as well as irredeemable), i think this is worth talking about, please bear in mind that not all steps are always present, it’s the overarching one listed directly below that matter- the others are for the purposes of identification (they also help it resonate through many tales.)


There are Three Acts: Seperation, the ones based on Seperation.


Now, presuming that the Land of Waves arc can be taken as a sort of prologue,  the introduction to the realities of the ninja world (and our characters), the next place to search for the beginning of the journey is in the chuunin exams- and lo and behold, Orochimaru (The Herald) appears and gives Sasuke the curse mark, specifically intended to drive Sasuke to leave the village and come seeking Orochimaru for power.


Of course, which lasts for the majority of the rest of part one, as he struggles to adhere to Kakashi’s warnings and resist the temptation to use this power Orochimaru has given him. Following Campbell’s observations about this stage of the journey, this results in negative consequences for Sasuke, he gradually grows angrier, more frustrated at his own lack of ability (coming to a head when he challenges Naruto to a fight.) he stagnates and the results are catastrophic, concluding with his final violent departure from the leaf village- here marks the entirety of the separation, from everything they’ve known


Next up is the Initiation:


Firstly: Naruto and the Sasuke retrieval squad are his threshold guardians, where he isn’t protected by their sentimentality and camaraderie. 


Now the Sound Ninja Five are Sasuke’s helpers, I’m tempted to say Karin, just for the lulz, I would argue that temptation is a larger constant force in Sasuke’s journey… it may have appeared earlier when he refused to kill Naruto, or even still exists based on the fact that he *could* still and gain the power up Itachi ordered him to acquire.) 


The next section of Sasuke’s story is rather confusing


 his assemblage of his team, it represents his “Belly of the Whale” Stage- suffice to say this is one of the darkest moments in Naruto. When Sasuke wins this fight, he dies (as I recall he is rendered unconscious), the rain that follows foreshadows his rebirth. Note that Itachi represented Sasuke’s conflict with the father(in accordance with Campbell’s interpretation, the childhood monster, the separator of him an parental love.)


When Sasuke awakes, his old life (living for the death of Itachi) is gone, his sorrow at what he is finally told of Itachi is like the rain that falls after the battle, immersing him in the waters of rebirth. It’s obvious at the end of this segment, when he stands out over the ocean and opens his new-found eyes, it foreshadows his rebirth (water represents rebirth, and Sasuke opening his eyes is reminiscent of a new born child doing the very same, through new eyes.) Also note that this happens at sunset- Sasuke is reborn into the Darkness of night. Suffice to say


Now, he still has another step to finish his rebirth. He gets his brother’s eyes transplanted into him by Tobi.


When Sasuke awakens, despite Tobi’s orders. When he leaves the cave in which he was awaiting, he does it into sunlight, moving from the dark into the light. I would argue that the scene after this where he is shown moving into storm clouds whereas everyone else was moving out of them, isn’t indicative of him moving into the darkness as I initially assumed- but rather him moving into conflict (whilst they ran towards peace.) 


Now comes the fun part, that we are nearing the end of our examination. If Itachi represents ‘The Father’ to Sasuke, the scene with Edo Itachi, where Itachi effectively forgives Sasuke for his death and tells him he moves forward with his brother’s love “no matter what” is “atonement with the father.” It frees Sasuke from the boogeyman of his past at long last. 


Now, his questions are self-knowledge: He wants to understand himself, his question to Hashirama highlights this (it’s question that has been essential to him since the Land of Waves arc, it came up in his fight with Danzou, it came up in the events surrounding Itachi and the Uchiha Clan massacre.) His questions will probably lead him to return, to give up his path, and embrace good.


What next? We don’t know, or taking on Madara (a primary source of his clan’s legacy of hatred). The point is, he will have completed his hero’s journey, and will return to that which he left (the village.) Talking to the kage is likely to give him a great boon (my guess is the rinnegan) symbolic of what he’s learned. 


I’m guessing he’ll die self-sacrificially

**COMPETITION IS NOW CLOSED**

Congratulations to **FrankBro** for winning.

The winner was randomly selected by entering EVERYONE'S name into an Excel Spreadsheet which was then scrambled.
I then used [this](http://www.random.org/) website to select a random number which subsequently picked a winner based on their corresponding number in the spreadsheet.

Thank you all for entering and I hope I find more random Naruto gear to give away in the future.",self,t5_2quts,1339020738.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/uiudc/uchiha_mostly_sasuke_merchandise_free_giveaway/
