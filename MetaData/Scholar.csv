TCP(+) LSD1 and Tubulin are the exact same photo. This is possibly just sloppy science and I do not think it effects their conclusions. It is very sloppy however and needs to be corrected.

The second problem is another paper by the same author. In this western blot, the migration artifacts on these blots look identical. Cell v.151 p.62 [pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021215) Figure 4a.

Identification of a novel human gene

Unoki M
Int J Oncol. 2003 Jun;22(6):1217-23.

**Abstract:**
To elucidate mechanisms leading to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we previously compared expression of mRNA from mononuclear cells of AML patients with that of normal controls using a cDNA microarray. Data from that study identified many genes that were commonly up- or down-regulated in AML cells. Of these, we report here the identification of a novel gene whose expression was increased in 27 (93%) of the 29 AML cases whose PBMC preparations include &gt;70% leukemia cells. The gene product, localized in nuclei, showed several characteristics of transcription factors: five zinc-finger domains, a leucine zipper, and several nuclear localization signals. Its 92.5% identity in amino-acid sequence to the murine penta zinc finger protein (mPZf; gene symbol Zfp91), suppressed cell growth,False,

A simple practical questionnaire technique for routine clinical use, was developed based on their answers. The DLQI was then completed by 200 consecutive new patients attending a dermatology clinic. This study confirmed that atopic eczema, psoriasis and generalized pruritus have a greater impact on quality of life than acne, basal cell carcinomas and viral warts. The DLQI was also completed by 100 healthy volunteers; their mean score was very low (1.6%, s.d. 3.5) compared with the mean score for the dermatology patients (24.2%, s.d. 20.9). The reliability of the DLQI was examined in 53 patients using a 1 week test-retest method and reliability was found to be high (gamma s = 0.99).

I'm seeking to ground my politics dissertation in a theoretical framework. throughout i have taken a new classical economic approach (so i have been told!) it is based around a form of redistribution called conditional cash transfers

Here is the paragraph: 

My economic assumptions are in line with a new classical economic theory. Whereby, CCTs become economically justifiable. The moral worth of attempting to create a more equal society through CCTs is founded on egalitarian beliefs. The argument is that the utility gained by the poor in creating a more equal society would be greater than the utility lost by the wealthy. CCTs do not only address material deficits in society, but also human capital deficits. As new economic growth theory suggests, human capital is an endogenous factor for growth. Therefore, societies utility is also improved as the reduction in poverty and increased human capital gives society the ability to produce more, and thus a higher standard of living will ensue.

While I am in favour of the concept of redistribution, 1975). Therefore redistribution cannot be done purely for the end of equality, but rather to maximise utility. To do this, one must ensure that redistribution is efficient and not harmful. It is here where my moral and economic assumptions converge.

1365191574.0,1br5sz,Removing watermark from journal articles.,koorka,9,4,4,"Hi

A lot of journals add a watermark which contain the IP address/institution name
when you download articles.  This might be a concern for privacy conscious
people.  Here's how I remove it on Linux (the process should also work on any
\*nix style operating system).

1. You will need [`pdftk`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftk) and [`sed`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/sed).
2. Use `pdftk` to uncompress the PDF file:
    
        pdftk article.pdf output uncompressed.pdf uncompress

3. Next

        sed -e 's/.*&lt;search term&gt;.*//g' uncompressed.pdf &gt; article.pdf

4. You can also use `pdftk` to remove the first few pages which might also
   contain some information.

        pdftk article.pdf cat 2-end output final.pdf
