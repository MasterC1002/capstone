Welcome to Reddits front page to the stock market!

This was an abandoned subreddit until earlier this year when I took it over. There was no activity and hardly any subscribers

We are starting to see a lot more activity and contributions from traders every day!

What can you do to help?

We all follow our own little universe of stocks and financial sites. If you see something informative or potentially market moving, the better for everybody!

Browse over CNBC, optionmonster.com, find something interesting and share!

Do you have a question about a stock or a trade idea? Post it! 

Want to get a chart up or even draw some pretty lines on it? Some very easy sites you can do that with

While my personal trading style is rather technical heavy, it allows us to compare notes and help each other out.

Do not be intimidated if you feel your level of knowledge if below others

Looking forward to reading your posts!

Also AAPL is on the MagicFormulaInvesting.com list and passes the Rule#1 criteria so it is a high probability good stock for the coming years.

I'm looking for advice on a career move


So, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.


3 months after working full time, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.


So far, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.


Thanks in advance.

Stock: MHH - Mastech Holdings.  They [just announced](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastech-holdings-inc-announces-2-221500346.html) a $2 per share dividend on 12/21 payable to shareholders of record on 12/20.

I've read a little and had a few conversations with friends about how the share price will likely decrease by the amount of the dividend after the dividend is paid.  I don't know how accurate this is.

If I take,000 and with half, take a Long position (to be a holder of record to get the dividend) with a stop loss at -5%, I should benefit from the dividend, lessened by the amount of the stop-loss delta.

If I take the other half and short the stock at it's current price, to the point I can select at will, until I pull the trigger (with a stop loss at +5% maybe, just in case).

Example: 

* $5

* 724 shares drop to $6.56 per share

* Short 724 hares @ 6.90; hold until price drops by $1.50 = $1

* Total gain on investment = ~$2

Bloomberg - S&amp;P 500 Posts Biggest First-Quarter Gain Since 1998
 By Rita Nazareth - Mar 30

U.S. stocks rose

Long version:

The big push in AAPL began in Jan when the stock gapped up $25 to the $450 range and took off from there. We call that a gap n go.

Since that was the launching point

The 50% or halfway market between these levels is $540. 

Next I did some Elliott wave voodoo, that would put it around $532.
 

We also have a support  declining support level coming in around the same range.

This is what the technical analysts at the big firms will be showing their bosses. Whether they decide to act on this kind of stuff, which again, is a nice round number that might attract buyers.

On Friday, and bought Put contracts hoping to profit from the move.  However, even though the stock moved down as I expected, the value of my Put contracts actually went down instead of up!  Instead of taking a 4% profit, I took a 4% loss.  Here's the trades I made:

Buy 27 Jun 2013 200-strike Puts

Sell 27 Jun 2013 200-strike Puts

Between the time I bought and sold, and the delta also remained the same (-27).

I've been trying to figure out how the Put could have moved down 8% lower than I was expecting.  Surely the time decay couldn't account for that steep of a drop in a mere three hours?  

Doing the math

(205.79 - 205.51) * 0.27 = 0.0756 expected gain in Put price


0.0756 + 1.61 = 1.68 expected value of contracts at sell time


(1.68 / 1.61) - 1 = 4.69% expected gain in Put price

What happened instead is that I had to sell for $1.56

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — LinkedIn Corp. may have spooked investors on Friday with a disappointing outlook

Several also pumped up their price targets on the stock — which had soared more than 60% over the last three months until LinkedIn reported first-quarter results on Thursday afternoon. Many analysts paint the lower forecast as a hiccup due to a change in the company’s marketing services business and management conservatism.

LinkedIn  shares were down 9% at $183.34 in early trades on Friday. The stock had set a new all-time high — crossing the $200 mark — on Thursday prior to its first-quarter report.

As well as divergence with the US Govt 10 Year Bond Yield:

But it's important to criticize one's own conclusions.  So here are my arguments why my trade is *wrong*

1. Oil broke into a new high territory a few days ago and there are no real resistance levels below $110.

2. The US Dollar's strength is starting to wane thanks to the Bernanke's jaw-boning.

3. Gold is making a technical bounce

Offsetting those facts

1. There are two gaps waiting to be filled

2. Contrary to popular opinion

3. Caught up in the fever

4. The inevitable downturn of the US equities market will no doubt revise 2014 consumption forecasts lower.

So, so wish me luck!

Second:

http://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/x0u3e/stem_update_officially_up_more_than_100/

-------------------------------------

And now the latest update.

So we had the typical sell off after the good news of the first CIRM award of $20MM.   This sell off was helped by a well timed downgrade by Roth Capital which drove the pps down to less than 1.45.   I knew that Roth was not a real analyst.  In fact Roth was the last financier to STEM and this downgrade indicated to me that their services were no longer required.  In other words Roth exercised all their warrants and sold all their shares and knew STEM had more good news coming in September and wanted in on that too.  They most likely went to STEM asking for another discounted offering and STEM said no.  This looked bad from a PR perspective but since I knew what Roth was trying to do(lower the pps to buy more cheap shares) I immediately started buying shares in the range of 1.45 - 1.63 .  So while my original average of .90 was raised I was also adding more shares to the pot.  My final average ended at 1.30 when Maxim started coverage on STEM as a BUY and a target of 2.60.  Maxim is just a bigger and more respected Roth so I expect them to be doing business in the future.  As to when I'm not sure.  Hopefully they don't need them.   Maxim's coverage popped the pps and saved it from further decline which worked out good for me because I was out of cash. :)  Finally STEM announced they would hold a CC on the upcoming spinal cord results which drove the pps up in a frenzy.  I sold 1/4 of all my holdings which is considerable.  Mostly the shares I bought in the Roth downgrade event cycle.  @ 2.16 this past Friday.  I did this to hedge against possible bad news on Monday when the spinal cord results came out.  

Well it wasn't bad news: http://www.nasdaq.com/article/stemcells-inc-reports-positive-interim-data-from-spinal-cord-injury-trial-20120903-00062

The important part being:

""We are very intrigued to see that two of the three patients have gained considerable sensory function. The gains in sensation have evolved in a progressive pattern below the level of injury and are unanticipated in spinal cord injury patients with this severity of injury


STEM is holding a CC tomorrow at 11:30 AM EDT to talk about this.  I encourage anyone interested to call in and ask questions.

Wednesday is the CIRM vote for another $20MM award for Alzheimer's.  The agenda can be found here: http://www.cirm.ca.gov/Agenda_2012-09-05/icocgoverning-board

The RFA we are interested in is: RFA 10-05.   So if you are listening to the call


Now back to trading.   So traders are fickle.  They tend to buy the story and sell the reality.  So we'll have to see how the market takes the spinal result news Tuesday in pre-market to judge it.  If it dips significantly I will step in and buy since we still have the CIRM award Wednesday which has an unknown outcome although I give it a high probability of success.  This is one reason I freed up some cash Friday.  

The key here is that STEM continues to bring in great trial results in high profile diseases while continuing to bring in non-dilutive cash via CIRM.  The last part is the most important.  Stem cell companies burn huge amounts of cash.  They usually raise money through very dilutive offerings through the likes of Roth Capital.  If that dilution does not occur you can expect big returns since this science is so exciting.  So right now by my calcs


**Update:**

Well the party is about over.  The sub committee at CIRM did not recommend the $20MM  Alzheimers award.  So I doubt it will win an award Thursday.  They can over rule the review committee but it doesn't sound like it in this case.   I sold all my tarding shares I bought from 1.45 to 1.60 today and now have left just my core shares averaged in at .97.   I will most likely let these shares roll the dice unless I see a golden opportunity to sell tomorrow which I doubt.  I hope it goes up but the event stream is ending in the short term.

There are 2 more partnership awards at the end of the year but that's a ways off and in the meantime a no vote by CIRM only increases the chance of dilution.  Hope I'm wrong on that. 

Signing out.


**Final Update **

Sold all my shares.   Made a huge profit trading this but without that award coming there is a strong possibility they could dilute so I'd rather take my large profits now and maybe get back in after dilution if it occurs.   May even short it a bit heh.

Good luck to anyone still in.


**Update 3**

March 9 (Reuters) - A heavy burst of bearish option action in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc in the hours before Starbucks announced plans to launch a single-cup coffee and espresso brewer has raised eyebrows among some option market participants.

Option bets on a big move up in Starbucks shares and on a sharp drop in Green Mountain stock preceded the news.

""The level of aggressiveness that traders early on Thursday came for Green Mountain March downside puts was very suspicious, a division of Interactive Brokers Group. ""It raised our eyebrows.""

Not so long ago

James K was a Global Strategist for a major financial instution

http://seekingalpha.com/article/376361-greek-default-and-devaluation-would-it-even-matter

Snippets:

&gt;the total value of Greek commerce in goods and services in the EU amounts to less than 1% of annual EU GDP. Besides

&gt;Another example of the importance of Greece to the EU: Simply writing off 100% of the Greek sovereign and private debt held by European public and private institutions would cost about 3% of total European Union (EU) GDP.

Yesterday I decided to purchase an out-of-the-money May 195/205 bull call spread in order to speculate on Amazon beating on earnings. I paid $4.10 for this spread. To offset some of this cost

165 is support and 195/205 is the 38.2%/50% retracement levels from Oct high to Dec low. I could have chosen a much higher spread like the 205/215 but I wasn't sure how much Amazon was forecasted to move. Normally I like to look at the IV but I didn't have time this time around. In fact

Total cash outlay including commissions was $320. If Amazon went below 195 after earnings

Tomorrow I will close the spread out with a nice gain... the 195/205 spread now worth close to $1000. And also Buy to Close the put for a near 100% gain.

China’s economic expansion would be cut almost in half if Europe’s debt crisis worsens

Based on the IMF’s “downside” forecast for the global economy, the organization said in a report released today by its China office in Beijing.

The outlook expands on the IMF’s warning last month that the world could plunge into another recession if Europe’s woes deepen. Premier Wen Jiabao reiterated last week his government will “fine-tune” policies to support growth amid the region’s debt crisis and the cooling domestic property market.

Has anyone here tried that?

3.  The much-anticipated Bioshock: Infinite is due out this Christmas as well.  The Bioshock game has some large boots to fill
