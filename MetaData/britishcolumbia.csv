From what I've read online and in the BC Tenancy Act

She wants to add ""landlord has right to give 30 day notice to vacate"" on the new lease

I'm looking for local common knowledge and personal experiences with this issue. I've only been living in BC for a year so I'm not sure if this is normal or totally wrong. 

Thanks for your help guys!

1368603701.0,1eddmo,We need to start talking about a Proportional Representation system.,Iblueddit,40,20,75,"I just looked at what the legislative assembly would look like with proportional representation (the popular vote % for each party determines the % of seats for that party) instead of first past the post. 

38 seats for the Liberals
34 for NDP
7 for the Greens
4 for the Conservatives
2 for the Independents.

This means no one gets a majority, and the Greens with the NDP. This makes:

Liberal/Conservative coalition: 42 (1 short of majority)
NDP/Green coalition: 41 (2 short of a majority)
Independent: 2

This election would literally come down to which side the independents join. First of all, and then only get 1 seat (1.1% of seats) in Victoria? Why is it that the 44%, a minority of people, that voted Liberal get 59% of the seats and now make all the decisions for the next 4 years? This seems unfair to 58% (a majority) of people that didn't want a Liberal government. Just sayin'.

EDIT:

Just so everyone's clear

I would propose a less complicated

Each district has 10 seats in it (for this example)

Instead

Beneath each party would be an optional section where, and you get to vote for which one you want to have a seat. The ballot would like as follows, where the # below represents a persons name. The X where this individual voted.


Liberal [X] | NDP [ ] | Green [ ] | Conservative [ ] 
              |            |              |
#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]    |#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]
#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]    |#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]
#3 [X]      |#3 [ ]    |#3 [ ]      |#3 [ ]
#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]    |#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]
#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]    |#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]
#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]    |#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]


The first thing counted would be the number of votes for each party. These would be tallied and then put into % for each party.

So hypothetically:

42% Liberal
38% NDP
10% Green
10% Conservative

This would directly determine the % of seats for each party. SO;

4 seats for Liberals
4 for the NDP
1 for Green
1 for Conservative

OK

Liberals fielded 6 candidates. The first person to get a seat is the Liberal candidate who received the highest amount of votes from the ballots. The second highest gets the next seat

Boom. Just as easy as the FPP system

The more seats you have in a district, with 10 seats in a district, you could need a minimum of 5.01% to get a seat - the number rounds to the nearest 10. Personally, I think 10 works because it allows for diversity without a crippling number of parties.",,False,self,1368669980.0,t3_1eddmo

Lately I have had a really bad case of headaches, I had 2 CT Scans on Friday and Tuesday as well. The good news it they didn't find anything big (no tumor or cancer). However the really bad explosive headaches are still there. I have an appointment with the Neurologist until May 23rd, and the only thing it can make feel good right now is this Percozet (Oxycodone 5mg) medicine which is making me really high all the time, making me unable to go to work, or to do anything basically. And if I don't take his, the headaches become so bad I can't do actually anything (they feel like Cluster headaches or maybe a Neuralgia).

Also my CareCard is still in process so some neurologists decided to cancel my appointment because of this, so I will probably have it tomorrow because this is considered an emergency.

My question, anything. Because I am getting really anxious/depressed for this constant headache =(.

I currently live in Vancouver

If possible can you tell me what program you attended and when? I don't view religion as a negative aspect of the school (unless it breaches objectivity of the learning experience) but i'm curious how much of it is a factor towards students who are not well versed in a christian or religious background.

If your too shy to post please pm me

edit: clarifcation

(1)Thank you VERY much for all your comments. I really appreciate them as picking an MBA program is important to me. Recent trinity western MBAers input is extremely appreciated. I am looking at their non profit mba because it would allow me to juggle work and give me a work related employment edge (or at least i have an in on how to leverage it). I ask questions related to religious influence because I don't want to be involved in business theorycrafting that discriminates because they are founded on religious principles. I want to know i can get an objective learning experience of a non profit nature with different inputs and not have my progress be hindered by policy control of information or censorship. 

(2) pre-emptive: i realise i could probably get that specific specilization in other business mbas but i just like to do research on this sort of matter. Obviously if Trinity's Mo conflicts with mine at an extremely fundemntal level (as in my personal principles and code of ethics) i'll move on. This isn't the only channel i'm seeking inputs from

My name is Patrick, plan and make lists. The previous admins have done a fine job making BUCK (Bronies Under the Care of Kelowna) into what it is, but have made some choices I found a bit frustrating; lack of publicity, awkward dates/times for meetups, and a focus on just Kelowna. I offer to you, a bit of a rebirth;

On August the Twelfth, at Parkinson Recreation Centre, and goes until people feel it's done. This is just the first meetup, focusing on the people aspect of the community; we won't be up to anything more exciting than meeting fellow fans and bronies. I'm pretty excited all the same.

Please bring a blanket or a lawn chair, enough people will be able to bring *some* kind of surface, that we can have everyone sitting on something that isn't grass. Blankets would be best, seeing as they're small and can seat 2-4 people, but lawn chairs are more than welcome.

Hello again- here's another in a continuing (2 so far) series of requests for input to help us settle in BC. We're moving up from California at the end of August, and the Tricities of Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam/Port Moody, and these towns are more affordable than Vancouver (we prefer small communities anyway) and would shorten the commute if we get jobs farther south in the Abbotsford area.
I'd like to hear your recommendations/warnings on neighbourhoods in these areas. We are a professional couple in our mid-50's; don't mind diverse communities
I'm aware that the area south of Haney mall in Maple Ridge has had problems with drugs and crime
Thanks in advance for your help!

A.) Take advantage of the lowered drinking age

B.) See some beautiful Canadian wilderness.

So for a few questions: 

1.) We'll obviously need passports

2.) I've heard a rumor that some establishments won't sell to American's under 21. Do any of you have recommendations on bars

3.) First night we'll probably grab a cheap motel and walk around since we plan to consume alcohol. How safe is Vancouver at night?

4.) Is it likely that we'll encounter snow or ice en route to or around Vancouver? Oregon DOT has a trip check website with snow reports. Is there a BC equivalent?

5.) Any obvious things I may not be considering? Currency exchange? Etc?
