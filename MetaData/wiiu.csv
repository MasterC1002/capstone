Starting to see some backlash from members regarding the recent surge of ""I just bought a Wii U"" threads -

For those of you who think it is merely karma whoring - please consider that these are new customers who are proud of their decision - and perhaps looking to fit in with this community. One of the best parts of this community is the fact that we're not the Call of Duty worshiping people that are very common elsewhere. 

Yes, and it is a nice thing to see customers speaking with their wallets.

...and I may have went a little overboard...

http://imgur.com/a/oaG1B

So far

* 4x SNES controllers (two went to a friend as gifts)
* 3x N64 controllers (still need to make one more
* 1x Genesis controller

I actually originally wanted to do this to have N64 controllers that would work with N64 Virtual Console games. Games like Mario Kart 64, of course, had to make more than one so that I could get friends to come over and play, as well. After that, I decided to make a few SNES controllers, then a Genesis controller because... why not?

The whole project took me about a month to finish. Essentially, then sends it out to the Wiimote. The challenge was figuring out how to properly talk to a Wiimote and emulate a Classic Controller. All in all, I'm extremely happy with how it turned out!

**Edit:** Turns out there's some interest in me putting together a kit or letting people mail me their controllers to mod them! I put together a quick form on Google Docs to help gauge the interest. If you're interested

*Form removed. Read edit 3!*

**Edit 2:** Wow. There's a lot more interest than I anticipated! When it comes time to actually putting together and sending out the kits, keep filling out the form for anyone still interested.

And they shared a douchey high five. I ignored it and carried on with purchasing the game and drove home.

I get home and the game doesn't work.

The next day I return to the same exact GameStop and tell them there is a problem. Same guy helps me.
""Are you sure your console isn't an original Wii model?""
I said that I was 100 percent sure.
""Well that's what happens when you get a crappy console at launch buddy.""
I ignored it thinking that this would be what I would get out of Gamestop employees. I asked about my options.
He said I could either go to the other local Gamestop
""Well we only carry one copy of each Wii U game since nobody ever buys them.""
I was wondering if he was being serious and asked if I could get Monster Hunter instead. He said that's the only game anyone had bought in a while. So I was out of luck.
I told him to call the other gamestop and ask them to hold it. He tried to deny doing it by saying ""Don't worry

He finally called and told them to hold it. When I walked out he started screaming ""WIIU WIIU WIIU"" like an alarm or something. 

I went to the other gamestop and got things settled quick

I'm speaking with the manager of the other store tomorrow. I'm not gonna deal with smart a$$ remarks while trying to simply return a game.

I live in Japan and bought Game &amp; Wario the day it came out here, but the graphics aren't good enough to be demoing anything. It is not a party game since there are only four multi-player games (none of which are the least bit enjoyable, even the very first time you try them). 

This game is lifeless, truly, without exaggeration, none of the twelve mini games will hold your attention for more than a single play. You could download 12 similar, free, iOS or Android games and probably have a better time. 

I'm posting this because I saw a recent thread saying that this will ""only"" be $40 when it comes out in the States

Only to state my case for how strongly you need to vote against this game with your non-dollars

To do this make sure you only use a 00 Phillips head screw driver. I almost stripped them trying with a similar size. The battery can then be removed and put back in. It will finally let you charge it and turn it on.  I wanted to post this because on many of the forums people said nothing could fix this and Nintendo would have to do it.

I see a lot of complaints about the Wii U

EDIT. Complaints/grievances that have been listed so far:

* accounts tied to sytem

* Slow loading times in menu

* inconsistent performance of certain apps such as Netflix

* Somewhat very small library of games for having been out for 8 months

* Trickling Virtual Console releases

* Not much 3rd party support

* Lack of ability to use 2+ gamepads

* Lack of ability to play DVDs/Blurays (I know the reasons why it still sucks)

* Somewhat weak hardware comparative to previous generation

* Too many game delays

* Digital triggers on gamepad

* Lack of console identity in the market

* region locking

* No games seems to be completely Enhanced by the GamePad save 1. Makes me feel like I wasted my money

* The Wii mode is treated seperate. So its not like we can feel a hybrid of Wii games on the Wii U. (manly talking using the Gamepad as a classic controller and having off TV play for Wii Games.)

* Lack of advertising

* Talk too much about Nintendo Staples (mario

* Lacking an epic story driven RPG (maybe I'm missing one?)
* A kindle app for the gamepad seems overly logical
* A few people have mentioned the lack of a music streaming app of any kind
* Too many controllers (Part problem for cost/storage
* The ability to watch Netflix and play a game on gamepad would be awesome but I'm not sure if this is feasible

* Freezing is a big problem. Os seems unstable and crashes sometimes. 

* No cross-game chat 
* No ability to send invites to a game lobby to other players
* Lack of sports games (not necessarily Nintendo's fault)
* The main menu sucks. Unlike the Wii, you can't even customize to show YOUR games (or the communities that you are interested).

* *More* apps in general. PS3 has all sorts of cool apps like Crunchy Roll. I know the people at Crunchy Roll are working on a Wii U app currently but I'm just using that as an example. 

* More use of the in pad mic would be good too. I've only seen it work with MH3 Don't know if it works with CoD or any other online game.

* No ""enter"" button on the Internet Browser Keyboard

* Issues with the wireless gamepad connectivity. 

* Cost of VC titles is astronomical

* Want new IPs. Or at least innovation on old IPs, Mario 3D, Mario Kart). Mario Galaxy was a great example of turning an old formula on its head. Nothing like that even hinted at for the future.

* Lackluster launch titles compared to previous Nintendo generations

Buy a Wii U and do not get to hung up on other games that are only going to be on Xbox One and maybe PS4.

Buy PC games from http://www.gog.com/ no DRM.

If a game comes out even on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Wii U and the Wii U does not get the DLC I'm still buying the Wii U version. No need to give Microsoft anymore of my money. Batman: Arkham Origins I'm getting the Wii U version.

Collecting retro games might be a new hobby so that opens up even more games you did not play.

I'm an indie RPG developer and I'm been pretty out of touch with the console community for a while. We've recently started making moves toward the console space and are looking into what our options are.

What I'm wondering is how much interest there is for RPGs on the WiiU. After the success of Xenoblade and the announcement of ""X

The reason I'm asking is because we're a very small team with very limited resources. Developing a console game for a team of our size is doable but an incredible effort of time and money, it's easy for us to recover from a mistake or two, but there are unique challenges to developing for a console that change the playing field a little.

I asked them ""when are you going to get the Wii U?"" All four of them

This made me incredibly sad. I tried explaining to them about the gamepad controller and how it's the next generation console but I just received blank stares.

1367555404.0,1dlni8,So I took my WiiU home from college....,nickjacksonD,186,41,38,"...As I had done during Thanksgiving break and Christmas break

Going back to thanksgiving, and my parents had a blast, even my sister (who is a sore loser) was enjoying herself.  But what made this different?  Well the gamepad is cool but that comes later.  The first bit comes from Nintendo having an online console, and my best friend who also had his WiiU home for the break.  I called him up, we video chatted, and then our moms video chatted (they're old friends) and they were blown away how cool this was(not tech-y people).  Then we proceeded to play *online* with this family, when neither my parents or his parents had ever played a game online before.

This is what hit me.  The way the Wii brought families together for casual gaming with motion controls, I throw the game on the TV, we all play and it is an absolute blast.  

The same thing happened just last week.  I have Kirby on my VC, and really truly bonding with my dad trying to beat this game.  It was hard(when I was a kid). So on a commercial I handed it to him, and he played it for a minute, said ""I'm not as good as I used to be"" proceeded to get a 1-up on the end level screen, turn the TV to the WiiU and play for the next 40 minutes.

Afterward, but just *got* this reflects, I think, what Nintendo has tried to do all along, which is **get people to play** be it games or experiences or whatever. Simple as that. 

Now we here are worried about this or that, which Nintendo have said they are focused on, and I agree.  I mean, I've never played a CoD game, AC game, or NFS game on a Nintendo console before but I have now.  Once this console penetrates the broad market as well as the hardcore games I truly feel it will sit among the successful consoles of next generation(hopefully with the next gen offerings of the other companies, as I support *gaming* in general


tl;dr My parents got into this console, everything will be ok because Nintendo is dedicated to their fans as shown by this vision of the WiiU

So sorry

I wasn't expecting much, so I figured I'd sooner give it my cash instead of a multiplatform game like Assassin's Creed 3 or Batman.

Turns out that ZombiU leans more towards something like Metroid Prime or an old-school dungeon crawler than anything else. You get dropped into an environment that's absolutely dripping in atmosphere with few supplies and are given a destination and objective. It's up to you to make it there and back in one piece.

Since you're left with so few supplies you have to scavenge the environment for whatever you can find. Luckily you're given an in-game analogue of the gamepad controller, and tag off any items for pickup, corpses to loot, or any other items to loot. (Lockers, chests, etc.) 

Ammo is, since this fits squarely into the ""survival horror"" genre of videogames. You'll be relying on your trusty cricket bat for the majority of your in-game defense, and this increases your stress, since you'll have to get so close to the zombies to attack them.

Your inventory is handled on the gamepad screen, leaving you open for attack while you're trying to dig out a different weapon or health item.

Overall, but as a game designed for the ground-up with the Wii U in mind, it really shows what the hardware is capable of.

EA Wait Time: 1 1/2 hours

Nintendo Wait Time: 3 minutes

EA Talk Time: 1 hour

Nintendo Talk Time: 8 minutes


Here's my story of what happened. Basically

Edit: This part above was a little condensed. I actually owned my Wii U for a couple weeks and had my Wii stuff transferred. It wasn't until my father told me to send it in and that it wasn't in an acceptable condition that I called Nintendo.

Well, I should have backed up all my Wii transferred content on a SD card. I didn't think I would get it wiped for a scratch. 

They said that they still have it and they would tell me when they could find it. Weeks later

...FREE stuff for having troubles? Hell

And that's when my call today happened. It took me less than 10 minutes to call them, and have my copy of Pikmin 3 get ready to ship for me. 



AND this is why I love Nintendo.

Edit: Allow me to expand. I was an early cheerleader for the WiiU, no matter what, at least I'd be able to get all those great old NES and SNES games for it. Setting aside what in my opinion is a very lacklustre first wave of VC games, I think $8 for 20 year old SNES games is just exorbitant. These are games that have recouped their costs years ago, and have already been released on SNES, Gameboy Advance, and Wii VC. 

I think a far better option would be to sell SNES game at $5 or less, many of which are free.

It's true that I couldn't buy the cartridge for $8

Although there are some games I would see as being worth $8, maybe even FF3. But the current crop of NES games is not worth $5, and I don't believe the current crop of SNES games is worth $8. You may disagree, but for me it's just one more disappointment with this system, one which Nintendo could have easily avoided.

The current state of the 3DS VC also doesn't give me hope that the WiiU VC will be any good any time soon. But at least it has it's own great games to play.",self,t5_2sjnz,1367423299.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1dg4ne/799_is_too_much_to_ask_for_super_mario_world/

Considering that the PAL release is [around a day away](http://www.onlinecountdowns.com/countdown-clock/show/Europe%20Wii%20U%20Launch%20Date%7C50b84b60%7C1)

**Miiverse is something better**
I was sceptical [when Iwata touted Miiverse as a sort of empathy network](http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-asks/Iwata-Asks-Wii-U-Miiverse-The-Producers/Miiverse-The-Producers/1-Empathy-Network-/1-Empathy-Network--662853.html). I mean


1) I'm playing Trine 2 (worth every penny) and I get stuck on a stage. 

2) I hit the home button and bring up Miiverse. 

3) I'm directly within the Trine 2 community and I click to create a new post.

4) I can choose to type a 100 character message or draw my message. On top of that

5) I choose to upload the view on the TV screen and type away a message asking for help

6) I hit the home screen again and return to the game


I continue playing around with the level and I still can't make heads or tails out of it. My homescreen button flashes...

7) I load up Miiverse from the homescreen and look at my notifications. I see 2 new comments

8) Turns out someone else is having trouble at the same area and also comments on my post asking for help as well.

9) The second comment is marked as a spoiler and I confirm I want to read it. It has the tip I need to continue.

10) I say thanks! and return to my game

All of this within about 5 minutes of time. There are examples of this everywhere in Miiverse. No need to set my controller down and practically no inconvienience. 

**Wara Wara plaza works well too**
As you may know, crowding underneith. If you tap on any of the Mii's, you will see questions like ""Is this game worth it?"", ""Can I use my headset?"", ""This application is a waste and someone should patch it"". This, along with lots of high quality drawings. You can follow through and see the conversation in Miiverse, find the game in the eShop or just add that Mii to your system.

We complain about advertisements on Xbox 360 (even if you've paid $60 for Gold!)

**GamePad benefits**
The most interesting thing about the Wii U, you'll hear the abxy buttons move around, but it has nothing due to the cheapness of the device. The screen is in a true 16:9 aspect ratio and is big enough even for those with eye troubles. [Apparently, It can even survive nasty arguments with concrete](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SIQpKh9ma88).

I've played around 15 hours with the TV on and around 10 hours without turning the TV on at all. Most games aren't doing anything mind blowing with two screens, I just switch to the gamepad and take advantage of the drawing using the touch screen. 

Speaker quality is nice

**[I've mentioned it before](http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/13p44x/while_not_a_reason_to_buy_the_wii_u_by_itself_it/)
100/100 on the Acid3 test, and on. The web is a great place to look for information and further cements the absolences of paper game guides (unless your into that sort of thing, which is fine)

**What about if you don't really care for Nintendo?**
Microsoft has Smartglass and Sony has remote play. Sony has had remote play forever, you can leave home with it. If you are a fan of Smartglass, wouldn't it be cool if developers automatically develeloped with a second screen in mind, expanding similiar experiences from beyond just Halo 4?

And if developers are creating second screen experiences for PS4 and the Nextbox

**[My previous disapointments](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/13u8xy/it_has_been_over_a_week_some_thoughts_on_the_wii_u/) still stand** until they get fixed. Sorry. But

**tl;dr:** Wii U is worth it. Oh

Shigeru Miyamoto is in New York City this week to promote his first Wii U game, which is coming to the US on March 24th. I've been offered an interview with him, and needless to say I am beyond thrilled and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me!

I'd hate to blow the interview on the million dumb things I want to ask him, /r/WiiU. Put your questions in the comments below, and at 10pm ET Tuesday I'll close things down and pick my favorites from among the top comments. I'll be sure to give everyone credit for their questions via reddit usernames in the interview itself.

The only thing I ask is that you keep your questions short and concise. While Miyamoto-san speaks some English

For some background/inspiration

I'm hoping to get this interview up this Friday on my just-launched WiiU YouTube channel

I'd also like to give a huge shout-out to my boss (and fellow sometimes-redditor) Mario Armstrong for helping to make this possible. We'll be running the interview on his site and have some additional gaming and Wii U-related content coming this month

This morning I walked in to Gamestop to pick up my preorder. 
Strangely, white shoes, with a huge gamestop bag looked at me as he passed me walking out the door and promptly away.
I looked at the cashier who still had said nothing (and this is my go-to gamestop so he knows my face and I know him well) and said ""Uhhh... I need to pick up a preorder???"" but something was already wrong
He responded with ""Yeah you're gonna have to hold on... I just got robbed.""


45 minutes later, and checked the video.. Yeah, the robber had a (probably .45 caliber) pistol and threatened cashier with it, then hid it so I didn't see.

Luckily me walking in is what scared him in to leaving.. So I guess I kinda helped technically...

Probably the greatest way to start a Sunday morning.

Never did get the game though. I'll have to go back for it later. 
He lost over $300 in cash and a few PS3's... The least I can do is to NOT say ""fuck that preorder I'll buy it somewhere else"". 


According to the cashier
So for the next few days I'll be looking for anyone in the area who just-so-happens to be selling ""Brand new PS3 unopened with an unopened copy of Madden"" on Craigslist. ;)

Block or add rules for the following net blocks in you firewall or in your router:

      206.111.0.0/16 (this is a huge block of ips)
      173.154.55.0/24

I also added anything that contains 

      c.youtube.com

What an insane difference this makes.

Just say'n YMMV but it works for me no more buffering issues in the YouTube app and in the browser video streamed at 1080p is flawless.

[Full tech details and credit go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13kmvd/have_time_warner_internet_but_can_barely_stream/?limit=500)

I can also confirm this does not mess up or hoark any other google services. May improve Netflix and poss Amazon speed issues as well but thats TBD.

Also if you don't know what's up you should be watching AngryVideoGameNerd (AVGN) which is one of the reasons I hunted down a solution for this.

1375868850.0,1jvh5x,Thoughts on Lego City: Undercover from a 29 year old casual gamer after 100% completion.,Traulinger,87,16,29,"**Intro:**

When I was younger, WCW vs. NWO Revenge, Halo, Diablo II, etc.  I suppose I considered myself a ""hardcore"" gamer at the time.  Now that I'm 29, work full time, and am married, I consider myself much more casual.  I still enjoy those genres (I own MH3U, but I also play a lot of Angry Birds and Candy Crush.
 
**Specifics:**

* Date Purchased: April 10

* Date Finished: July 20

* Purchase Price: $54.21 (w/ tax)

* Hours Played: 56.5

* Average Hours Played Per Week: 3.92

* ""Cost"" Per Hour Played: $0.96

**Pros:**

* Fun story line that doesn't hinge on an existing character or world

* Sandbox style gameplay that offers more freedom

* Tons of extras side quests and collectibles to increase time of play

* Unique game mechanics that utilize the gamepad as both a minimap and data scanner

* Lots of fun movie and pop culture references for us adults

* Age appropriate for children

**Cons:**

* Horrible load times

* Camera angles often resulted in almost unplayable areas

* Some collectibles almost impossible to locate without a guide

* Combat mechanics were super simplistic

* Red Brick bonuses made studs almost pointless.  I finished the game with billions of studs.

**General Thoughts:**

I really enjoyed playing Lego City!  The fact that it was a world not based on Superman, but it added a sense of accomplishment once you had located everything.  That was a huge reason why I got so much game time.  Think about it.  I payed less than $1.00 for every hour played.  How many console games can offer that?  I thought the use of the gamepad was well thought out and unique, and frankly, had I not have had the data scanner, I wouldn't have finished in nearly the time I did.  The movie references were a real plus as an adult.  It helped beef up the enjoyment of some of the missions for me.  I particularly liked the Shawshank references on Albatross Island.  On the downside, the load times were atrocious.  I realize sandbox games have more to load, but it was out of control in my opinion.  Additionally, I would have loved to see some more complex combat mechanics.  I realize it's a Lego game and they have to cover a wide demographic, were bigger

**Conclusion:**

This was a great game and I'm more than happy that I purchased and played it through.  I think it has elements that will satisfy avid gamers and casual gamers alike.  If you haven't had a chance to play it through

I did 4 player multiplayer with a bunch of friends and we were laughing our asses off and having fun. You can use the GamePad, and Classic Controller/Classic Controller Pro in any combination. The game takes your picture for your on-screen avatar too, which can be hilarious. It reminds me a lot of Earth Defense Force on 360/PS3 if you're familiar with that game at all.


So, as I've only downloaded two multiplayer levels for a total of 8 bucks that I can see myself playing with friends for a long time (especially summer party fun season coming up). Definitely not worth 50 bucks at launch, but for free, or at least only a few bucks, it's a steal.

1356198099.0,15acbq,"After surviving the end of the world and 3 weeks with the Wii U, here's my impression [Long]",Zoracka,78,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/15acbq/after_surviving_the_end_of_the_world_and_3_weeks/, because I want to play through the first one first). English is *not* my native language

Before I list my impressions I will just list how much time I've used in the different games and apps. 

* New Super Mario Bros. U: 28 hours
* Sonic Transformed: 24 hours
* Nintendoland: 19 hours and 30 minutes.
* ZombiU: 9 hours and 40 minutes
* Netflix: 12 hours
* Miiverse: 9 hours

All in all I've used aproximately over 100 hours on the Wii U in december (I've not listed the misc. features such as browser)

When I buy consoles I don't expect nor look for powerhouses

* **The System**

The system is still *new* and I expect this to change someway or the other over the years just as the PS3 and the 360 have done. I agree the loading times are horrendous, when your friends join your plaza they could sleep if they were offline, wandering around if they are just idle and sitting with a gamepad if they are using an app. This should come with the feature when you press on them it says (as it does) last played title and *currently playing*. 

One of my bigger complaints however is the friendlist. While I'm glad they put the friendcodes in the trashbin, is the Daily Log. It's a small thing, but I like being able to see how much time I've spent in different apps and games. I've not used the internet browser that much, but it seems like a really good browser and I like its accessibility from within games.

But overall I'm rather satisfied with the interface other than the loading times. I'm not a tech guy so my knowledge on the hardware inside the box is very limited. 

* **The Gamepad**

The most unique thing about the Wii U is definitely the gamepad and probably what most people were looking for. In this section I will merely talk about the quality and not the implemention in games. I do think that the gamepad is very comfortable to hold and play with. You really needed to get used to the second screen but for me it became natural rather fast. People have said that controller feels cheap but I disagree with that. I do think it feels very solid. The bottuns are very responsive, but personally it has not been a problem.


* **New Super Mario Bros. U**

I've always loved Mario and the games with the Italien Plumber. I have always preffered the 3D Mario platformers over the 2D and after playing a good amount of NSMBU I still prefer 3D Mario games. NSMBU is a great game

 That aside

Other than the boost mode I think the gamepad is poorly implemented in this game. I think it's a lazy design choice to show the exact same thing on the gamepad as on the TV screen (It's extremely distracting

* **Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed**

I never played the previous Sonic All Star Racing game, but in cars it's incredible), good powerups and interesting and beautiful mapdesign. Personally I like the character rooster (20 characters) because they offer great variety and with 5-6 mods to each character you have loads of different characters. The game is also very challenging, especially if you try to complete each world tour on S-class (4 stars). It is not easy at all. 

I've not really played this game online but from what I have played I have had no connection issues whatsoever

Compared to Mario Kart (Unavoidable) this is definitely a strong competitor, haven't tried MK7).  

The gamepad is implemented as expected to this game, much like in MKDS, where you can see position of everybody in the race and their power-up. The game utilize the option to play purely on the gamepad by swiping your finger down (Or up for returning to TV + gamepad combo). 

And all of this comes from a guy who never really have been into Sonic games and Sega platforms.



 * **NintendoLand**

This game has surprised me, especially) and offers a great, but sometimes cheap, challenge. My favorite singleplayer games in this are Metroid, Balloon Kid and Octopus Dance. The multiplayer aspect of this game is excellent as well with great games in the Mario's -, Animal Crossing's - and Luigi's universe. 

What I really liked about the game that I didn't know of is the coins you get for playing the minigames. These coins can be used in a coindozer game where you can win prizes for your personal park. 

Off-topic: Making achievements this way could be very

On-Topic: NintendoLand is a fun compilation of great and not-so great minigames. Even for eingleplayer games I really enjoyed this game alot more that I expected to. 

The gamepad implemention is this game is very different from game to game

* **ZombiU**

I really like ZombiU. I really do. I'm just not that good at it because when I loose my survivor who I've used 3 hours with I get depressed and can't really be bothered to continue right after. But I really like the survival aspect of the game and how you don't just plunge down enemies like they were cockroaches. While one zombie is never really a challenge you need to be on your feet if you meet two or more. But the idea that you get a new character when you die or turn into a zombie is pretty cool and it's usually pretty sad killing off your previous character to regain your loot. 

ZombiU really use the gamepad excellent. You have a map of your sorroundings while playing

**Conclusion**

I'm very satisfied with my buy and I really enjoy the Wii U. I like that I am able to use my Wii remotes and nunchucks on the system and that most games support this controlmethod as well. This is my first console that I got on launch and I think it seems like a great lineup for Nintendo

Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll answer (I've used up almost all my characters for a reddit post!). And feel free to add me on the system

With the Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate demo coming out next week I thought I might take a moment to address all the people who have never played this game or played it previously and didn’t care for it.  This is not a guide so much as addressing common complaints people have when first introduced to this game.  I want to say I love this series

**Complaint #1: The controls feel clunky**
I don’t know anybody who has ever played this game and not been wary of how clunky it feels when you first pick it up, making attacks and using items opens you up to attacks from your enemies, so you need to learn when to go and when to stop.

**Complaint #2: Where is the target/locking system?!**
There isn’t one, but it isn't quite a target lock.  I haven't played with it yet so I can't speak much more to how it will work.**

**Complaint #3: Where is the health bar of my enemy?  For that matter where is my enemy?**
Tracking monsters is part of the game, nor are breaking these body parts necessary to kill something).  Eventually the monster may start to stumble and run away back to its nest to try and recover some health, at this point you need to finish it off as it flees.

**Complaint #4: The camera feels like it needs babysitting.**
The camera in this game does require more of your attention than usual, it is up to you to decide at that moment in time which is more important.

**Complaint #5: These starter missions are boring. (This probably won’t apply to the demo)**
Yes they are, now in the demo for these game they usually skip this bit and just let you fight monsters and give you gear/consumables so really you can skip this unless you are playing the full game.  The full game is trying to ease you in because once you start actually playing it gets really hard really fast. They don’t take that long but you will get through it.

**Complaint #6: Okay these real missions are really hard.**
Yes they are, and that is because its hard in a way that challenges you as the player.  At times you may feel cheated, you may feel underpowered, you may need to go kill some lesser stuff a bit more for practice and better weapons/armor but you will conquer that challenge and you will come out far more satisfied than following waypoints as most modern games hold your hand and play more like an interactive storybook than a challenge.  **If you don’t like challenges this game may not be for you, if you grew up during the era of games that don’t push you this game may not be for you, if you grew up gritting your teeth over frustration of Battletoads and Megaman but kept going, this game is for you.**

**Complaint #6: There really isn’t much of a storyline**
No there isn’t

**Complaint #7: I feel overwhelmed by all of the monsters/armor/items.**
So like I said there isn’t much of a story, videos of monster kills, tips and tricks.  This game isn’t about some secret hint that makes a monster go from impossible to easy, there are monsters that will go from impossible to hard but that’s about it.  This game is about you and your skill.  Weapon upgrades, armor upgrades, and items are merely tools not solutions.


**Below this point are more informative items and not really complaints people have


**Tip #1: How do classes work?**
Classes don't work the way most people are used to, they just have different damage amounts and types and skill bonuses associated with them. Also in the full game choosing a weapon does not lock you into that for the entire game, and there are no requirements/caps on weapons, if you can make/buy the weapon you can use it.  The only limitation is that once you are in the field on an actual mission you are stuck with the armor/weapon you chose before leaving town, and can not switch until the mission is over.  There are only two classes of armor BladeMaster/Gunner.  Blademaster armor can not be used with bowgun type weapons, but Gunner armor can be used with bowgun weapons and non bowgun weapons.

**Tip #2: How do I level up?**
As I stated before this game is about skill, you can kill a bunch of a kind of monster to get materials to make better armor/weapons, but that usually means killing something fairly challenging for where you are in the game.  The best way to get farther in the game is practice and honing your skills as a player.

**Tip #3: How about character skills?**
So some armor and weapons will have attributes that give +/- to a character skill

Dragon Age is $4.99
Mass Effect is $4.99
Bulletstorm is $4.99
Assassins Creed 3 is $14.99

Sony is hosting a mega sale as well. Games are around the same price point and they seemingly have sales like this more frequently. Most games listed are 5 or less years old

Batman Arkham Asylum is $4.99

On the eShop a 25 year old Nintendo game costs $4.99... A 22 year old SNES game costs $7.99. A 15 year old N64 game costs $9.99

What can we do to send a message to Nintendo that this has gotten out of hand? The games are not even tied to an account!! I'm done purchasing VC games until something changes. I mean beyond sending emails and calling we speak with our wallets. 

I don't think this is a fight the consumer can win though. At those prices if Nintendo sells 200,000 sales at $1 to equal it... Enough people buy into this bullshit that I don't see things improving for the consumer. Hell I own 26 VC games..

What you need to do instead is add it via Miiverse. Here's how to do this (at least for the US version):

- Launch Miiverse

- Select ""User Menu"" at the top left

- Select ""Search Users""

- Enter ID

- Select ""View Profile""

- Now click on the ""Friend Request"" button at the top right

- Add a message if you wish and send

Now

Also note that you do not automatically follow your friends on Miiverse. You'll have to do that manually from their profile.

1376088202.0,1k21ij,I think there is a lot of confusion in this subreddit between the differences of output resolutions and rendered resolutions. Lets have a chat /r/wiiu.,janitar1,71,14,31,"So lately

The Wii U supports 480-1080p output resolutions. When you set your settings to ""1080p""

What does this mean? ELI5 version: A game such as Skyward Sword will only make 480 vertical pixels per frame of the game. Now, it will just scale the image down so it comes out on the tv without cutting too much of the edges off. 

**Your Wii U will not add anti aliasing (smoothing of edges) automatically on Wii or VC games** like the Dolphin emulator can. **VC games do not scale render resolution** as well (there have been very very rare cases in which they do). The only time you will a game outputting a higher rendered resolution than the original copy is if the game has literally been remastered (obviously emulators bypass the need to do this) like Metroid Prime Trilogy (render resolution increased when they added wide screen support). 

Most games will fuck up if you automatically add in widescreen or scale the render resolutions up- minimaps get all junked up, but it doesnt just automatically work. Another issue with upscaling render resolutions is the fact that **textures do not scale up**- they will always stay the same. So a game like Conduit may look sharp and smooth when render res is scaled up, but the textures will look like butt hole. Look at Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, the game ran and outputted in 1080p but many of the textures remained very low res which in some peoples opinions, detracts from the experience. 

There was a video posted today showing Melee running on the Wii U with forced widescreen. The output resolution of the game was 720p, it simply can not be rendered higher. Now down the road we may see support for running those games in Wii U mode where emulators/loaders may actually be able to render games at higher resolutions but for now you wont see that happen on your physical Wii U or Wii. 


Someone has asked me to discuss **component cables vs HDMI cables**, whereas HDMI support 1080p and up to as high as 2k** (for high speed HDMI). Since the Wii U only supports up to 1080p, **you shouldnt notice a difference in picture quality.** Now that really depends on the devices you use. Some handle HDMI better than Component and vice versa, you just have to compare on a case by case basis. Interesting things though with Component cables! Since they are analog (varying voltages that are interpreted by the TV as different colors) they are susceptible to signal interference from other cables, EMIm and RFI. This typically isnt an issue for most consumers though! HDMI signal can be messed up by very powerful magnets though so be careful around those things. One final note on cable differences. HDMI cables run a single cable with digital audio inside, component cables do not have this feature and end up having a mess of 5 chords.

Regarding the drought of games Nintendo land satisfies me and will continue to do so for months while I have Darksiders II to play through with all the extra content, also  £15, eventually. But really if Nintendo make a big effort with the first party titles then the system is worth it without third party support, for me anyway. (Thats not to say I dont want more third party support, I find the attitude some fans take, 'Didn't want it anyway"", when a developer doesn't put a game on the Wii u is unhealthy for the system.)

So in summary here are my thoughts.

Pros-Fantastic gamepad integration where developers can be bothered
       
- Nice
       
- Internet browser is better than my family's home computer
      
- Some good games if you haven't played them before

- Big first party games coming in 2014
      
- Price

Cons - Miiverse needs improvement
      
- Slow OS 
       
- Lack of third party support

* Wii U Availability

1. **Where can I purchase the Wii U?  Is it in stock?** - Most online retailers are past the initial shortage and have been receiving a steady supply of both the basic and deluxe consoles.  You'll need to check the individual retailer's website to verify if they are currently in stock.  The same is also true of brick and mortar stores.  In the US, Targets, and other ""big box"" stores have a plentiful supply.  Some people looking for the Wii U in metro areas may find it harder to locate a store that is not out of stock.  If your ""big box"" store is sold out, check the retailer's website to see if there is another store in your area that has the Wii U in stock.  It may require a lengthy trip if you are adamant about your purchase.

* Wii U Games

1. **What games are currently out for the Wii U?  Do you know the release date for (insert game here)?** -For a list of all current and upcoming Wii U games

2. **Why am I unable to purchase certain games from the eShop?** - Depending on the country you live in, Mexico) users.  It is currently not known if Japanese users will have restricted access to games on their eShop.  Other titles, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and Skylanders Giants, are currently not available on the eShop and must be purchased at retail.

* Wii U Console

If you lose your connection or power during the download, [contact Nintendo customer support](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp) immediately. 

2. **Are the system updates required to play my Wii U?** - No, download in the background and prompt you to install the update at your convenience via the download manager in the home menu.  If you do not install the initial system update you will not have access to certain Wii U network features.  These are: Nintendo Network ID creation and linking, Miiverse, Nintendo eShop, Internet Browser, Friends List, Wii U Chat, Download Management

3. **How long does the initial update take to download and install?** - The time to complete the initial update is dependent on the speed of your internet connection.  It may take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours.  If you're impatient

4. **My Wii U froze while at the main menu/in a game.  What do I do?** - If your console freezes at any point, you may need to [contact Nintendo customer support](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp).

* Wii U Accessories  (Only purchase and use first party Nintendo and/or officially licensed third party accessories!  Items below are linked for demonstration purposes only!  Unless specifically stated otherwise

1. **What controllers am I able to use with my Wii U?** - At this time, original Wiimotes including newer Wii U branded Wiimotes with built in Motion Plus, original Wii Nunchuks including newer Wii U branded Nunchuks, the Wii Classic Controller, and the Wii Balance Board.  Nintendo has stated that in the future the Wii U will support up to two Wii U GamePads on one system.

2.  **I'm unable to use the HDMI cable that came with my Wii U.  What are my options?** - If you are unable to use the included HDMI cable

4. **Can I use the GamePad or Pro Controller to play games (including Virtual Console titles) in Wii mode?** - At this time the GamePad and Pro Controller can only be used in the Wii U main menu and for Wii U apps and games.  There has been no word as of yet if Nintendo plans on adding support for the GamePad or Pro Controller in Wii mode.  You can use any of the original Wii accessories or the rebranded Wii U Wiimote and Nunchuk in Wii mode.

5. **Do Wii U games that use the Wiimote require motion plus?** - It depends on the game. For example, do not require Wiimotes to have Motion Plus.

* Nintendo Network

1. **How do I add friends on the Nintendo Network?** - There are two options available.  The easiest is to search for your friend in Miiverse, similar to the UFC system on the original Wii, DS, and 3DS.  Neither party is notified of being added by the other when using the Friend List.

2. **I've added my friend

3. **I had a great time online with other users, what game you last played together, and what time.  You can also send them a friend request by tapping the ""Send Friend Request"" button, or by visiting their profile in Miiverse by tapping ""Go to Profile"".  Remember that to notify a player that you have added them and to prompt they add you in return you must send the friend request via Miiverse.  It is possible that both parties are prompted and notified when tapping ""Send Friend Request"" via the ""Users Played With"" tab in the Friends List, but has not been confirmed.

4. **How do I send messages to my friends?** - Messaging is located in the Miiverse app.  Once the app is loaded, they will still be on this list with ""You haven't exchanged messages with this user yet"" under their name.  Simply tap on the green arrow and your message history will be displayed.  Tap on the ""Write Message"" button in the bottom right to send a message!  Messages are threaded, similar to threaded texting on smartphones.  Receiving messages from friends will cause the home button to quickly blink twice, similar to when a friend logs on to the Nintendo Network.

5. **Can I sign in to more than one Nintendo Network account at the same time?** - At this time it is not possible.  Future updates may or may not include this feature.

6. **I bought the Deluxe Wii U, and log on with your Nintendo Network ID and password.  Your DDP account is created automatically when you created a Nintendo Network account on a Deluxe Wii U.  Points are retroactive and granted even if you have not yet accessed the DDP website.  You will receive approximately 10% of your purchase back on all digital purchases, including codes purchased at retailers and redeemed on the eShop (A $59.99 USD purchase will net ~599 points towards your DDP balance).  Currently points are redeemed 500 at a time to receive a code for $5 USD credit on the eShop.  The Digital Deluxe Promotion will run until the end of 2014 and any remaining balance and codes must be used by March, 2015 wherein they will be permanently deleted.

* Tips and Tricks

1. You can move the icons on the main menu!  Tap and hold the icon

2. You can power on the Wii U, the options to do so are located in the System Settings app!

1361561510.0,191d0u,Monster Hunter Tri U Demo: Tips for new players part 2,found_a_penny,59,5,51,"Hey all

It was mainly focusing on key complaints people historically had about the series when starting out but not specific to this demo because... well I hadn't played this demo yet

First couple general points I want to make.  Monster Hunter is a fantastic game with a steep learning curve and an intimidating play style.  Very few people pick up the game and say hey this is great!  A general rule of thumb I've heard before is it takes 5 hours of play to really *get* the game and learn to play properly, once you play any monster hunter game you can pick up any other monster hunter game and be ready to go in under an hour (weapon sets and movesets change between games).  Also keep in mind the full game easily has 150+ hours worth of content.  Part of the reason I think this game has such a high initial time investment requirement is because it plays very differently than most games today, the closest I can compare is Demon/Dark Souls, where it requires you to switch gears a bit if you are not used to the style of gameplay.  Secondly its a hard game, and it will challenge you and frustrate you.  The game requires player skill more than simple experience/gear grinding, and to be honest the series is not for everyone.  

I think the biggest reason that the series has not taken off here like it did in Japan is that having a friend who plays makes it a lot easier to learn


**Tip 1: There is a manual!!**
I didn't even realize this until I saw it in another thread, at the bottom of the screen you should see an option to view the manual, this is very helpful for explaining a lot about the controls and goals, and more specifically the attacks for specific weapons.


**Tip 2: The new monster targeting camera is great
This is more useful for the 3ds where you are lacking a second thumbstick to control the camera, it should now look like a stylized picture of the monster you are hunting, if you click that then crosshairs will appear over the icon and you have activated the monster targeting mode, now whenever you tap L it will point the camera at the monster instead of straight ahead.  Tapping it twice will look straight ahead.  You can also reverse that in the camera options in game.

**Tip 3: What weapon should I use?**
This one is really tricky because different people prefer different weapons, I can kill the Yeti monster in about 10 minutes with it, so you definitely have the time, but it will be closer than with other weapons.  Dual swords is a bit harder to use because you can't block but if you want a challenge then I recommend this weapon for beginners because it keeps you a lot more mobile than other weapons but gives you higher damage output, the cost: no blocking.  Here is a simple breakdown (in my opinion) of the strengths and weaknesses of the weapons. My personal favorite is the longsword, but it can be tricky to use.  

| Weapon   | Damage Output    | Mobility     | Can Block      |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Sword &amp;amp;amp; Shield        |  Low        | High        | Yes        |   
| Dual Blades        |  High        | High        | No        |
| Great Sword        |  High        | Low        | Yes        |
| Long Sword        |  Med-High        | Medium        | No        |
| Hammer        |  Med-High        | Medium        | No        |
| Hunting Horn        |  Med-high        | Medium        | No        |
| Lance        |  Medium        | Med-Low        | Yes        |
| Gunlance        |  Med-High        | Low        | Yes        |
| Switch Axe        |  High        | Medium        | No        |
| Light Bowgun        |  Medium-Low        | High        | No        |
| Heavy Bowgun        |  High        | Low        | Optional (No in demo)        |
| Bow        |  Medium        | High        | No        |

Another breakdown of the weapons that goes into more detail can be found [here.](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_Types)

**Tip 4: Is the demo an accurate portrayal of the game?**
Yes and no.  They are only showing you the hunting portion of the game

Beyond the hunt, what kind of damage does it do? That will affect what armor you pick.  How fast is it?  Does it have breakable body parts?  Can you sever the tail?  All of these will affect what weapons you pick.  And if you are playing with friends then that also affects what decisions you make, some classes work better together, if you have a 4 man hunting team then its usually best if at least one person is ranged so you aren't fighting for space to attack the monster.

**Tip 5: Is there multiplayer in the demo?** No.

**Tip 6: Why do so many people love this game but I'm not having fun?**
Well there are one of two reasons.  The first reason is that unfortunately the game might not be for you.  If you like the concept but you are struggling with the controls and it feels clunky then I say you keep going and you are just in that unfortunate awkward stage.  Like I said up above this game has a drastically different playstyle than most other games

It's a catch 22 here, and it is for a reason: Its fun if you can get through this awkward phase, you just gotta get through it.**

**Tip 7: Items**
When you start the actual mission you will be in a little area with two chests


| Item               | Description                                                                       |

| Well Done Steak | Increases your stamina by 50 points |

| Raw Meat | Used in the cooking mini game with the bbq spit |
| Mini Oxy Supply | When doing underwater missions this restores your oxygen bar without having to surface |
| Map | If you drop this then you don't have a minimap |


**Tip 8: Enraged Monsters**
You may notice that when you do a lot of damage quickly you may see the monster's breath and it is moving faster

1353345853.0,13gi95,My quick Wii U review after Day 1 (long read),imranh101,76,24,40,"Luckily
But after getting home with it
We only grabbed New Super Mario Bros U because... Well
After the 1.5gb, we were able to hop in to Mario. Kind of disappointed solely because in multiplayer with a wiimote + the tablet, only one person can play as Mario - the other person just taps the screen to drop platforms for Mario to jump on. To play with Mario + Luigi you need a seconds wiimote (which we have but got lost when we moved!)

So the multiplayer was kinda disheartening. BUT when I got home last night, YES, turned OFF MY tv, then proceeded to play NSMBU on JUST the tablet controller. Like, I was playing full fledged Wii U game on just the tablet controller. You can actually do this with Black Ops 2, Assassins Creed 3, Batman : Arkham City, you can play on the TV OR you can play on the tablet - turns your tablet in to a DS-XL that plays COD

How that works is pretty simple, then simply streams the information back to the tablet controller. The catch? It's super fast and responsive. Believe me I've used such applications as Splashtop on an iPad, and OnLive too - it'sEXTREMELY fast, you can't even tell there's a Wii U console rendering off-device - It SERIOUSLY feels like you are playing the thing as a gameboy. It is SOOO responsive - I can't stress this enough because it literally feels unreal to me how fast it runs!

Also of course these games DO run 60fps on the tablet (assuming the game runs 60fps which I believe all current WiiU games do.)
The thing does have great build quality as mentioned

I got the 8GB white console, a stand to hold your Wii U upright like most people have their Wii, and includes the Nintendoland game. On that note, the white 8gb Wii U does not include any game. From what I understand, Nintendoland is not a whole bunch of fun if only playing by yourself, or maybe even one friend, but is a lot of fun playing with 4-5 people. Similar to how Wii Sports was.

All in all I wasn't looking forward to it being a kickass console after playing with it in Gamestop's kiosk, or kicking back in my deskchair, on the tablet controller, sounds AWESOME. The 1.5GB update was annoying but what can you do, it's more than possible it fixes some console-breaking function they found or something, I'm not gonna complain.

As of now it EASILY gets this following score from me, the tablet controller really IS innovative. It will play a huge roll in a lot of games. For the first time, the Wii controller has the same number of buttons on it as a PS3 or 360 controller - 2 joysticks with click-in buttons, 4 facebuttons, start/select, L1/L2/R1/R2 and a home button. The fact that you can give the TV to someone to watch TV on, and just play on the tablet is simply intelligent. I also forgot to mention one of my favorite features. When setting up the console for the first time it asks you what brand TV you have, volume/channel up/down, right? Wrong! It's the GREATEST feeling that when I get home from work I can just drop down on the couch with THE TABLET CONTROLLER. Don't have to search for and find a TV remote

A lot of people think the controller looks awkward. IT DOES... LOOK awkward. But somehow Nintendo did it right. It feels good to hold. It's not at all heavy. It has a built in rechargable battery pack and includes a charger. I have yet to let it run out of battery, and dpad Nintendo has ever put in a controller. The screen is about 6.2 inches and feels right. Smaller and it would feel like a little ipod touch in your controller.. Bigger and it feels like a kindle fire in your controller... They really found a sweet spot. The resolution is very good too, you can see single pixels if you look really closely but it can't be very high-res or it becomes too much data for the console to stream to the controller. The quality is very good anyway, PPI is more than great. 

For those wondering

The only complaint I've heard/had with it is that some menus take a long time to load, which has fine load times, too.

AS OF NOW

**Main WiiU Menu-**
Top left corner shows the current User.

* When making a new user for the console you can only use the ones already created on the machine or transferred from a 3DS(maybe Wii).

* It seems that each User ~~needs a different email~~ can use either a different email or use the same email for multiple Users. You also need to set up a password for the User account. I think its because you make a unique Nintendo ID for Miiverse and all your data is tied to the User ID for Miiverse and purchases.

* When making a new User

* **It looks like each User gets a different Friends List.** My list is not big enough to see if its 100 people shared or an individual 100 people per User.

* &gt;If you press the TV button

**Miiverse**

* There is a Manual for how to work Miiverse when you click under User Menu (top left corner) and choose Settings/Other.

* While browsing through comments and you click on a user, since they're added to your ~~console~~ User list.

* &gt;In Miiverse if they have a cube with a checkmark on it when posting it means they own the game. Courtesy of Rapptz.

* &gt;If you end a post on Miiverse in ellipses

* ~~While sending a friend a message for some reason I had the option to attach a picture of my current WiiU menu. Not too sure why it doesn't work in the communities or why I can't choose other pics.~~ After some experimentation I found that if you're in the middle of a game and can hit the Home button to get on Miiverse

* While browsing a Miiverse community you'll notice that a post will have the persons icon on the left followed by the name


**Internet Browser**

* Youtube videos seem to work fine.

* If you hold ZL and ZR you can tilt the gamepad to scroll. Alternatively

* Holding down X when pulling back the curtain will start a drumroll.

* The Wii U menu and Miiverse all looked extremely impressive

* Confirmation of the Wii U GamePad having STICKS was great

* The Wii U Pro Controller looked like a solid controller to offer core gamers. I think playing a game like New Super Mario Brothers U with the Pro Controller instead of a sideways Wii Remote would be perfect.

* Pikmin 3 was awesome. There's no denying that it'll be one of the best games at/around launch. Amazing graphics

* New Super Mario Brothers U didn't disappoint. The trailer itself uring the conference didn't offer much, which was really cool. Plus, the integration of Miiverse looked really neat, with friends leaving comments and pictures and reactions and tips embedded within the game (which could be turned off of course). They also briefly mentioned how asymmetric gameplay would be integrated into 5-player (!) multiplayer. One player has the gamepad and can put objects/boxes/whatever into the game world for the other 4 players to use. 

* NintendoLand is shaping up the be the Wii Sports of the Wii U

* Scribblenauts Unlimited looked really fun

* Zombi U seems to be the exclusive mature killer app we've been wanting to see. Cynics labeled the game as this generation's Red Steel

* Batman, Assassin's Creed III, Darksiders, and more old third party stuff at least gives us SOMETHING to play with our new system and in new ways. Putting the full game on the GamePad's screen, and/or using the GamePad's screen as map, inventory, or whatever gives us a NEW way to play games. This lineup is stronger than DS, or 3DS launch lineup

* Confirmation that all Wii digital downloads will be transferrable to Wii U was a big deal for me. I would be ecstatic if GamePad screen use was confirmed for Virtual Console games!!

Overall, NSMBU and Scribblenauts, but there is a lot to keep me busy in the months following like Zombi U, Wii Fit U and all of the 3rd party ports. ",,False,self,False,t3_uocc6

No

After my hard work on the wiki, I hope to move this subreddit forward as the Wii U's lifespan continues on and on.

_______________________________

Now

- hold a special Nintendo Direct live discussion thread here on the subreddit

**or** 

- direct folks to /r/Nintendo's ND thread

**or** 

- direct people to the official /r/Games Nintendo Direct thread which was confirmed not too long ago.

There are a few folks looking to create special E3 discussion posts and we'll promote them accordingly.
_________________________________________

Also, sadly. 

Someone had suggested that the community would be able to curate the content properly, but mods will have to put in the extra muscle to remove any duplicate posts.

We're looking to keep things as streamlined as possible and to free the subreddit of unnecessary clutter

Another idea that I had tossed about were individual discussion posts for games that were announced which would contain ample information (trailers, but I figure that it would quite an uphill task to create threads for every single game, so again, that's up to you in the comments to decide.

I ended up finding a ZombieU bundle w/ Nintendoland and also picked up NSMBU. 

Personally I feel the system is truly amazing. Nintendo has really come up with something entirely new and innovative. NSMBU is crazy good and looks soooo incredible. Haven't gotten to ZombieU or Nintendoland **yet** ;-)

I can't wait to see what their first party development brings to the system and really show off what it's capable of doing. 

So I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for all their opinions and comments. Both the good and bad.
