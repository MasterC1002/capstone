Small intro

I am project lead on a web app. The project is nearing to the and and CEO decided that he wants an phone app as well (never mind the fact that we pushed this since beginning

I am pushing the solution where we should hire an agency, he apparently knows ruby php,  python , css, jquery, you name it.  Young lad in his early 20s. 

When we decided we want the app

I am all for supporting previous colleagues, that a person at his age is experienced at every single thing that I mention, yet still ""currently not busy"" . On same token - I am aware that good nad passionate programmers will pick up any language, given time. But that's not the point - we need someone who  knows the code already and will do his job professionally as we need the app in short time;  not someone who will spend time google coding. I can find dozen of people (including myslef and my team members) who can do that.

Cut the long story short

My knowledge of iOS app development is very limited. So, etc)

Is it unreasonable for example

Thanks.

For the past 6 months I have been working on a mobile puzzle game called Roll With It! I was hoping for the game to make a bit of revenue for me to be able to afford my next year's tuition.

After a lot of work in order to make the most out of the game

I'm afraid that if it keeps not selling I will have to suspend my academic education and find a job since I won't be able to sustain it. And this is where I need your help - spread the word about my game! Try out the demo, tell the world about it.

I love being a game developer and I believe this can be a great jump start into the gaming industry. If you support indie games

I already have big plans for my next game and I'm sure all of you will love it

Please help me make this game a success... It doesn't have to be a big one. Just enough to keep me going.

While you're reading you can tap a word and get a pop-up definition or translation (currently supporting Swedish, Spanish, and Arabic). The context-sensitivity of the definitions is what separates this from automated definition translation technologies, in that this is actually accurate. The reason it's called Flikkt is because while reading in the app you can save words you're trying to learn to your personal dictionary (called a Flikktionary) by flicking them downwards. Here, you can review them and use them in word games etc.

I really need some help with a program I want to implement on iOS. I am not much of a developer/coder

What I want to do is some object recognition using the back camera. Essentially I just need to theshold an image from a camera feed, and perform a bit of calculation with those centroids and display over the camera images (the calculation is a bit of an iterative optimization but I'm assuming the image part takes more processing). All I'm looking for is to see if it's possible to do this at around 15 fps or better. Assuming I can get the camera feed at the 1920x1080 resolution, would looping through that kind of resolution be too much to get that kind real-time speed?

We spent this year finishing our game [Stories Together](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stories-together/id586431338)

It's free to download and play

It's a turn-based ad-lib contest through a storyline that you play with friends and family to see who can continue and complete the best original story.  It's basically like Draw Something meets Words with Friends meets Mad-Libs.

You choose from more than 75 starter sentences that will help you write killer adventure, romance or fantasy stories and earn virtual currency for buying bonus words and being more creative than your opponent. You can share each turn of your story on Facebook and Twitter, or by text. You can play random players through Facebook, which stays anonymous and enables a huge network of friendly opponents to play against. There will be more ways to login in an upcoming update. Considering Gmail or Game Center - let us know what you think about that.

We are really looking for feedback and will be sure and post updates as Stories Together progresses. If you like it

1348175822.0,107owl,Anyone notice any Text-to-Speech bugs in iOS 6?,alexandervanderpool,2,0,0,"
Before I start

Ok, but hopefully someone knows how to fix it:

In iOS 5, I tap ""Speak"" to have the text read aloud to me. I absolutely loved this feature and use it nearly every day. Sure the ""voice"" was a little robot-y, but it was still way better than anything else I knew of.

Enter iOS 6, but seems to be laggy. Forget about selecting whole pages, unless I want to do it one paragraph at a time. If I do manage to get the whole page selected, the experience that awaits after tapping ""Speak"" only inspires more grumbles. Sure, the text will be read aloud, but the voice is somehow degraded (maybe ""raspy and muffled"" is a better description). Worse yet, it seems like the length of pauses between paragraphs grows as more paragraphs are read. It gets to the point that you wonder if the end of the text has been reached.

Trying to scroll up or down the page after speech has started is useless, only to have to experience the whole ordeal from the beginning.

Has anyone else noticed this? Were you able to fix it? It is casting a dark cloud on what would otherwise be a really great iOS 6 experience for me.

Also- I've confirmed that the weird voice is also present when selecting text-""Speak"" in other apps.

Given the XML at the following address:

Write an iPhone app that: 

+ Has a root and a detail view controller. 
+ Displays the first name, sex and photo of each one of the contacts in one cell of a table view, on the root view controller 
+ When each contact's table view cell is tapped
+ Uses ARC \(Automatic Reference Counting\) 
+ Uses Asynchronous URL connections. 
+ Has the deployment target of iOS 5.0 

Make sure that your app: 

+ Doesn't use any third part library/classes.
+ Doesn't leak memory. 
+ Doesn't block the main thread when performing downloading operations. 
+ Reuses table view cells.

I have virtually no experience with apple products and I figured this would be a simple task.

I can export the playlists (1 by 1) into Itunes but those playlists seem to have no information at all on them.  He has roughly 200 playlists and rebuilding these one by one seems like a lot of work.  This frustrated me to no end and seemed like a common, and difficult to the point I have given up entirely.  

I fear for people who trust Itunes to actually backup any of their information.  Other than the name of the Ipod no information was stored in this backup.

I don't have access to my Recovery Key and Apple removed the last of my trusted devices. I've spoke with Apple Care multiple times

UPDATE: Clarification about my intentions.

Why you had only iPhone as trusted device?

* Because i only had iPhone as an Apple device

Do you actually own this account?

* Yes, ID with which i can prove that this account is in fact my own. I have my password and everything is working correctly, apart from the fact  that i can't manage my AppleID.

Why do you want to know the recovery key content?

* Because i want to know what i'm looking for

Am i after something malicious here?

* No, music, movies) is non-transferable.

How come you didn't changed your key while you had your iPhone trusted?

* I didn't know i've lost it

What do you hope to achieve with this topic?

* I hope that someone that went through something like this

To my best knowledge, our above described calendar sharing arrangement has become less ideal. In some instances it has even become an annoyance. Siri will also state my wife’s appointments when I ask her about my schedule for tomorrow. The same thing goes for Notification Center, which shows not only my own appointments but those of my wife as well. This is annoying, especially if we both have a busy day scheduled.

Does anyone know a way to make iOS aware of which calendars are mine and which ones are not? Or maybe there is a way to tell iOS/Siri/Notification Center to simply ignore certain calendars?

I have started to look for a solution because I foresee this becoming an even bigger problem when iOS 7 comes out later this year, etc.)

I found that Parallax actually does work on iPhone4

Here's how you get it to work:

1. Download a Panoramic image from somewhere on the web.  Here's a good one to use: http://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sunset-cliffs-panorama.jpg

1. Save it to your camera roll

1. Now go into settings and change you background image.  When selecting your image

1. Set it as your lock screen or Home Screen or both.

1. You now have a very crappy implementation of parallax.  It only takes up half the screen (unless you tilt it forward).  BUT


The point of this is that Parallax obviously can work on iPhone4
