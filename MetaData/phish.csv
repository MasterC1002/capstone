The site still has a few kinks to be worked out, which I'll be adding this week.

The next main priority is to get the site working smoothly on mobile devices.  Eventually you will be able to create a user account and create custom playlists, and I welcome any suggestions or thoughts you all have.

Thanks for checking it out!

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words everyone.  Site is getting a bit more traffic than I expected...I'll be working on speeding things up later today.  Can't wait for this summer,False,self,t5_2ql29,1363634983.0,,,t3_1aiu50

Some questions:

1.  If you're familiar with the 3 ""Types"" of Phish jams (as classified by *some* fans), or in improvisations at all?... Explain.

2.  You've been public with your struggles with Oxy, creating.  But can you talk about how different drugs have influenced your improvisations in the past?  Specifically the process of improvising and creating in the moment while being influenced by certain drugs?  Which drugs were valuable/wonderful/regrettable/horrible?

3. Who is improvising right now that you admire in the live setting?  Can you recall any recent moments seeing other artists where you were locked into a groove or jam the way you do with your audiences?

Others?

__________________________________________

It is very unfortunate to hear this news

My Phish journey started in 2009.  YEMBlog has always been there.  Not just aggregating, pictures, websites, people... everything.  There is currently nothing like it, no perfectly filtered one-stop-shop.  Hell, /r/phish was a wasteland about two years ago.  I started to post nearly everything from YEMBlog to here, and it really did breathe life in to this place. This subreddit becomes more and more active by the day

We have to step up.  We have plenty of people here that should be able to at least *attempt* to recreate what one man has done for years.  Aggregate content from other outlets (keeping the source obviously), anything.  Almost more importantly... *VOTE* on what you like/dislike. 

The Reddit voting system is something that can be utilized in a big way to filter content.  Voting here is generally very lax due to the small size of the community, I don't want to be the guy telling people how to use *their* Reddit. but the general consensus I see in the comments is that we are sick and tired of failed meme attempts and useless posts.

___________________________

**TL;DR** - YEMBlog is going away.  If we step up we can make /r/phish a place with not only streamlined content,False,self,t5_2ql29,False,,,t3_rq3i3

Now I'm hooked and having a great musical experience right now. Just thought I'd share.

Phish last played Bangor (pronounced 'BangOr, **11/2/94.**  It was the first show after the legendary 10/31/94 ""White Album"" show; hosted the Tweezer from *A Live One*; saw one of the earlier versions of Guyute; and boasted a Foam during which my friend swears he can be heard screaming the immortal words ""yeah! yeah!!!"" on tapes from the show.

Whether you happened to be at that show, which was literally [torn down last month](http://bangordailynews.com/slideshow/demolition-of-the-bangor-auditorium-from-start-to-finish/) upon the arrival of the new (and oft-mentioned in this subreddit) Cross Center.  

The Bangor Auditorium was basically an architectural and logistical monstrosity.  Its acoustics were horrid at best, I'm a product of the 1960's, and I'm here to stay!""

But for many mid-90's-era Maine fans

I wish beyond all wishes that I could be on the Bangor Waterfront for Wednesday's show, safe tour opener for all who make it so far up North!  You'll love you some good old Maine hospitality.  Hope to see you all at Dicks (which we all love)

**tl;dr:** to those of you headed up I-95 this week, enjoy yourselves, and most of all, enjoy myself!

-Trey's little trill after the line ""Well the telephone was ringing"" in ""Wolfman's Brother.""

-Fishman's yells after the ""neurologist"" line in ""Suzy Greenberg.""

-Trey's trilling in David Bowie

-The roar of the crowd when they recognize that a rare and loved song is being played

So, as I expected.  With each new summer show I got a little bit excited about glimpses of the powerhouse I expected to see, but it was for the most part only glimpses.  The biggest surprise to me was not Trey, who I expected to be rusty, but Fishman.  He was way off his game in 2009.  09 Wasn't horrible, but it was the rebuilding year I knew we'd have to endure.

Fast forward to 2010.  The summer tour was the return of the fun-loving, goofing off... made me really optimistic about their direction and potential for longevity.  The downside was, there was still a bit to be desired in the technical department.  Fishman was on fire, though.  He really sounded better last year than I have EVER heard him sound, just really polished and a true professional.  Trey was definitely getting back in terms of technical ability, but the biggest downside to his playing was his current gimmick: the whale call (whammy).  Of course he's always used the whammy but not to the extent he was Summer '10.  I was actually defending it, because to me it meant that Trey was still trying to expand his sound and wasn't allowing himself to stagnate.  Every now and then he'd use it really well, atonal riffs that threw a lot of people off.  Some people didn't get it and actually thought he was just screwing up.  Fact was

Which brings us to Summer '11.  At this point

1. The whammy is being used pretty sparingly

2. His #1 ""gimmick"" he's exploring right now is the dissonant jamming and he's nailing it WAY better than he was last year.  The key is how he ties it back together when he shifts back into the right key

3. Every show has been pretty much a linear progression (which you can kind of expect from the first tour of the year).  I haven't heard last night's yet (got it queued up though), the best I've heard Trey playing since 2000.

4. Thematic jamming.  One thing Trey TOTALLY lacked in '09 was that ability to hit on little melodic themes that he could explore and expand upon.  Most of the jamming from '09 was just him running up and down scales, play it slightly different, and branch from that.  That's what gave his solos purpose and direction in the old days, and allowed the jams to morph and shift around into different areas.

5. Confidence level.  It's as high as it's been since pre-hiatus.

6.  The fun factor is as high as it was last year

7.  It's clear Trey is not content playing the ""signature"" riffs that we've come to expect out of him throughout his career.  What this translates to is, he's got a whole new bag of tricks that will prove to be just as good.  And good for him for not allowing himself to stagnate.  That's the sign of a really great musician.

8. Return of the Boomerang!   I for one REALLY miss the delay loops of 1.0 and 2.0.  He's using it differently this time around

If you haven't been following the last few shows, his fingers will never move that fast again"", ""he has a family, he can't practice as much"", ""he'll never get it back"" type shit over the last 2 years.  I feel like we can finally put that to rest.

I'm going to both Merriweathers and Portsmouth and I can't contain my excitement right now.

Just had to share.

Due to some unfortunate circumstances

I was psyched about the free full 'Roo stream, and compared to the Bonnaroo stream, I thought it was garbage. 

I had the roo stream in VLC running at the same time I had a torrent going, and I had it fullscreened on a 1080p monitor I have attached to my computer for video editing.  Looked like a goddamn blu-ray movie.

In contrast

That would have been fine if I could have maintained a continuous stream.  I had no torrents running or anything else bandwidth heavy on my network.  I forget now

Because...

[MK DEVO on youtube](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fmkdevo&amp;ei=R1PoT978E4SI6AH92vTgDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBcas4wZGkMKU_zCnDplBOAGt8lg&amp;sig2=YSuEJF9U_s_FH2uOhL4img) is where it's at for couch tour now!!  I've made it a habit to not look at any setlists each night

Now, hit play and sit back and enjoy the ride.  If I don't know the setlist, it's like I'm watching the show live.  

And the quality of his videos (both audio and video) I have to say is near A+.  I don't know how he gets such good audio on his vids

The other thing I like is that it's a continuous shot

So, MK DEVO is the way to couchtour!!

Also

That's it



tl;dr - [MK Devo](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fmkdevo&amp;ei=R1PoT978E4SI6AH92vTgDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBcas4wZGkMKU_zCnDplBOAGt8lg&amp;sig2=YSuEJF9U_s_FH2uOhL4img) is THE man for phish on youtube and is my go-to for couch tour this year.

Colors match up with the current seating chart.  Sections 1

Seems like the floor is an entirely separate entrance.  Could not see if wristbands were required, you must enter from a separate entrance once inside one of the ""Towers"" (A,B,C,D). East (back) GA Floor was a lot smaller than expected.  The West (front) GA Floor is quite large... hard to tell from the picture.

There used to be a walkway behind the now ""100"" section (formerly 100/200) and in front of the now ""200"" section (formerly 300).  The allowed fairly easy access to any 100

This is no longer the case.  There are no barriers blocking 100 Level navigation

The 200 section makes up most of the rest of the place.  This was essentially previously the ""300"" level.  There appears to be an open walkway behind this section (above the red square on the image).  This allows somewhat easy free-roam around the  back of the 200s.  This walkway is only on the two sides

400s and West Balc (WBALC) are behind the stage and slightly higher up than the 200 section.  It also appears that these sections are free roam.

As usual

Hope this helps.  Enjoy!

Encore: Terrapin Station[1]

[1] Phish debut.

(http://phish.net/setlists/?d=1998-08-09  )

It was the three year anniversary since the death of Jerry Garcia. There was a feeling, they would have to say something. And after two sets of great Phishyness, they came back for the encore and played Terrapin Station.

You can hear it in the crowd, the exuberance. For a long time it seemed like Phish was doing everything they could to distance and separate themselves from the Grateful Dead, if only to solidify their own identity. (Look back at some 80's set lists, they played a lot more Dead in the early, early days).

But after Jerry died

I was not at this show, but the Terrapin Station tore me up. Fifteen years later it still gives me goosebumples.
