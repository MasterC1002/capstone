2. If you are using Chrome

When you first begin, Earl, Joel Lehman, Task Rabbit, Skillpages and if need be Oscar Smith.

You can do surveys during this time as long as you have above a 95% or 99% approval. I also highly recommend you get the Adult content qualification. This will open up a lot.

Transcription wise Crowdsurf tends to be the best when you first get started. You can take the test and make really good money as long as you follow the directions.

* Bookmark the HIT search with your [preferred search conditions](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&amp;searchWords=&amp;minReward=0.25&amp;qualifiedFor=on&amp;x=13&amp;y=7). (I use two conditions: [1] pay at least $0.25, out of mind' is, that's what this is for me.

* If you do put the HIT search link on your bookmark toolbar, hit 'Properties' and copy the ID number whenever you need it. Chrome doesn't have bookmark Properties like Firefox, but you can just rename your bookmark to your mTurk worker ID instead. Right click the link on the toolbar and hit 'Edit'. Type your mTurk worker ID. Voila.

* Download [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) to quickly screen for shady requesters. It will place a button (an upside down triangle, y'know, don't.

* While you're at it, it's built into your browser so you're good to go.) This script lets you block/ignore requesters from your search results. It will place a little 'x' beside each requester's name. To block, just click the 'x'. This helps clean up your search results, and saves you time when you block scammers/requesters with poor ratings. Unfortunately, for reasons unbeknownst to me, this script doesn't work in Chrome. So it goes.

* Get yourself an AutoPager script/add-on. As you're nearing the end of your search results page, baby!) Here's one for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mmgagnmbebdebebbcleklifnobamjonh) and another for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autopager/). Disclaimer: I haven't used either of these. If you have a better suggestion, lemme know and I will edit it into this post.

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/111134) will add a 'Pending Earnings' item to your dashboard. Note that the only time the script runs is when you click on the Pending Earnings link. So do that every time you want an update.

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95331) will add a 'Today's Projected Earnings' item to your dashboard. It basically totals the earnings from all the HITs you've done for the day. Obviously it can't account for potential bonuses or rejections. But it's useful if you set a daily earnings goal for yourself. I aim to earn $1/day. [Thanks to [iamtehinternet](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamtehinternet) for mentioning this!]

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/126924) will display your account balance and worker ID in the header ([screenshot here](http://i.imgur.com/gHCGu.jpg)). Just a note: you don't have to double click the worker ID to select it -- just hover your cursor over it and hit Ctrl+C to copy. 
 
* Bookmark [/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor](/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor) and check it when you feel so inclined. If you don't like viewing by 'what's hot' you can bookmark [/r/HitsWorthTurkingFor/new](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/new) instead. Whatever works for you. 

* Try messing with the 'sort by' field in mTurk if you're having trouble finding good HITs. I tend to find some good ones when I sort by 'new'.

I really am beginning however to question the use of adfly for links on HWTF for the following reasons:

#1.  The profit is minimal. Even posting prolifically will only earn you a very small % of your total turking money each month. 

#2.  With HITS coming and going so fast lately that extra 5 seconds can really mean the difference between getting to the HIT on time or not.  

#3.  Adfly has had outages in the past few weeks

#4.  Last week adfly downloaded a setup file to my computer twice.  I am assuming using a script on the intermediary page.  I immediately deleted the files but the potential for them to be malware is pretty distinct.  I understand given adflys business model they cannot really pick and chose

For those above reason I just directly link to the Mturk page

You may see the HITs you have completed shown as ""Approved - Pending Payment"" for days after you begin Turking. These funds will be released

**I did a HIT a week ago and it *still* hasn't approved. What gives?**

All HITs will auto approve within 30 days. This means they have up to 30 days to approve the HIT. 2-4 days seems to be the average time. CrowdFlower has their auto approval set to one day. Check out [this](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/130470) script to see a requester's auto approval time. 

**I did a hit fairly and I got rejected! What can I do?**

Usually, download [Turk Opticon.](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/).

**Who is your TO

TO (Turk Opticon) is every Turkers secret death ray against scammy requesters. TO shows a little triangle next to a requesters name and shows the rating of the requester. If it's mostly green - you've got a fair requester. However

**Will I have to submit tax information?**

You might. If you make over $600 in a calender year from the **same** requester, you can make $600 or more per year on mTurk, as long as you never make more than $600 from a single requester.

**What are my options as an international (i.e. outside of the U.S.) user?**

Unfortunately

**How do I find good HITs?**

One word: /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor. If you find the subreddit useful

**What are qualifications

You really only need one of them right off the bat - the Adult Content Qualification. If you plan on doing writing HITs

**Can I do a HIT more than once?**

Unless it says that you can

**How can I tell if i've already done a HIT?**

This is different for every Turker. Some do Excel spreadsheets

**Where can I find good scripts?**

[Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/sdyuo/turking_scripts_and_addons/)

These are all the FAQs that I can think of - anyone have any more that they see on here a lot?

From sodapress:

**What is my cap on the first ten days?**

You can have up to 100 accepts

Question from turkinforlife:

**What constitutes a good HIT? Who are good requesters to make money/build approved/rebuild %?**

A good HIT is one that pays at least 10c a minute. Other good HITs that may be low paying are easy ones such as playing games or ones with a possibility of a bonus. A good requester to start with is CrowdFlower. They often have no qualifications
*Do not ever do a HIT that requires clicking on a ""short"" link (like adf.ly, etc!) however, if you're on HWTF, we use short links as a monetary incentive.* Likewise, do not EVER submit personally identifying information (your city, state, birthdate, last name

**I live outside the US. I made an account with an american address

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Because these payments go through Amazon Payments, legal name, birthdate, etc on it. There is *no* way around this.

**Why do they ask for my SSN?**

They need this to verify your identity. Rest assured it is kept safe with Amazon

***TEMPLATE FOR EMAIL TO AMAZON***:

Hi
A whole bunch of my fellow turkers and I were massively rejected by requester 33cube. MASSIVE rejections for supposed ""poor quality"" work that all got rejected in a single minute. That seems virtually IMPOSSIBLE that someone can review 54 submissions or more within a single minute and reject them ALL at once. This is a scam
He's now put up thousands more to scam us all out of even more money. Is there going to be something done about this? I don't care about losing the money, care about my numbers, which decide what jobs I will be able to do on this website. I use mturk to pay for medications, bills, and rent.
This would not be such an issue to me if it were only me. Sure
What are you planning on doing about this? Can workers depend on you to have their backs? Or are we all on our own?
Please email me ASAP.

* **Take advantage of the communities and tools at your disposal.** Aside from this subreddit and /r/hitsworthturkingfor, and [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/). In addition to providing really good HITs, these places can answer most of your questions and give great feedback on specific requesters and strategies.

* **Get yourself over the 1000-hit threshold ASAP.** Seriously, and it will eventually pay dividends. I dilly-dallied with surveys for a long time, and while they provided great pay rates, there's a whole new world that opens up once you've completed 1000 HITs. Just by browsing the ""HITs available to you"" category and sorting by ""HITs available (most first),"" ""HIT creation date (newest first)"" and ""Reward amount (most first)"" you can almost always find jobs that pay close to .10 per minute.

* **Don't be shy with repeatable HITs.** I know this one is going to be controversial for some of you. But if you're careful to check requesters' TO ratings,** keep a list of recurring ones that pay well and don't reject your work, you'll grow to absolutely love them. Here are some of my favorites:

**Mark Olsen - Collect Nov 6th 2012 general election endorsement URLs for the listed political parties:** With the election rapidly approaching, which took an average of about 45 seconds once I got the hang of them. I pestered Mark with questions early on, all of which were met with very prompt and detailed answers. I did over 100 of them with no rejections.

**Super Searches - Usability on Search Scoring:** These seem to pop up about once a month, then you rank them in terms of their usefulness and give a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation. Another .10 for 30 seconds of work. I do 50-100 of them each time they pop up, and have yet to receive a rejection.

**Amazon Requester Inc. - Rate Refinements????:** I don't remember the exact title of this one, and you're asked to rate the usefulness of the refinement. If memory serves, it pays .10 per HIT (each one taking about a minute) with a bonus for quality work that essentially doubles your pay rate. I remember being a bit skittish because of a questionable TO rating, but I did about 50 of them with no problems and received a full $5.00 bonus in the end.

Which is fine but I wanted my rejection revoked... he said he dind't know how

Then he sends this ""Now, instead of a confirmation code, the words ""f*** you"", so, unfortunately for you, I am no longer inclined to help you out with this and you can blame your peers. I just might consider revoking the rejection if you can honestly tell me that you are a Republican or Democrat and that you submitted a confirmation code, but otherwise I will not.""

So i answered him back... he finally says ""Fine I'll revoke the hit."" I say thank you

""Well, here's his/her ID: AQBP1QO28MWAU If he/she suffers some consequences for his/her behavior (to remind you he/she sent the words ""f*** you"" as a confirmation code), then I maaaaybe will consider revoking your rejection. But seriously, it doesn't matter, do more HITs and your record will be fine, and I really don't think I incorrectly rejected your HIT in the first place. You probably either indicated the wrong political affiliation, entered a code that was not valid, the directions don't say that I won't pay Workers who only do half the survey

Its my first rejection... I don't really care about 1 rejection, but he was probably a jerk to them too. Anyways, I told him he must be a very unhappy angry person if he holds one person's rudeness up to everyone else for no reason.

I'd also like to preface this by saying that **I am a legal US citizen over 18 years of age with government issued ID, birth certificate, and credit history, all accessible to me.**  The hard part would be finding a fax. I did not create my account until I was 18.

I found out about mTurk via some /r/bestof post that linked to /r/beermoney.  It was a fantastic idea, registered accounts on the associated sites, and got a few choice scripts.  The 8 days I was able to turk I sumbitted 424, with 385 approved (1 reject, 58 pending) for a total of $48.03 and $5.80 pending.

Then I got the email.  A second request to verify information.  I thought nothing of it; I filled in the forms and happily went back to turking.  I could never had seen how wrong I was.

Almost immediately after, I was told it would be ""12-24 hours"" before their Account Specialist's would get back to me.  Almost immediately after hanging up, I received what looked like another automated message.  It said the same stuff (""...keeping with applicable banking laws, access to your account has been restricted."").  I thought it was just another email from the system, as the email I was getting would tell me what documents to fax over.

My second call was 5 days later.  The rep did the same thing, this time slightly different than the rest.

I'm taking that as their finishing move.  I am not able to have an Amazon Payments account due to whatever bullshit verification process my information goes through.  There goes more than $50 and almost 400 approved hits in an 8 day timespan.  There is nothing more I can do.  If you managed to get all the way down here

**TL:DR; Amazon Payments took the banhammer to my account after they failed to verify my information.  Lost $50 and almost 400 accepted hits.**

&gt;Further correspondence regarding the restrictions of your Amazon Payments account may not be answered.

The more I tried to talk to them, and it is all uphill from here.

I decided to start from scratch.  Tried the callback for Payments, say hello, and then hear a robot say nobody was home and hang up on you).  Called up Amazon Prime (of which my family has been a very active customer) and tried to get them to transfer or give me the number of the Accounts department. Jane @ Amazon Prime was very understanding, but could only forward me to Payments, where I talked to Rebecca.  Turns out they (or at least she) are based in North Dakota and were having some pretty horrible weather.  After hearing my claim, she opened a new ticket and forwarded it to the Account Specialists (she didn't have their number).

I am an occasional poster on this subreddit who is talking today because I found myself in a rather large financial bind. I got all my bills paid yesterday, which means I will need to get myself $603 if I do not buy anything else for the rest of the month (and let's face it...I will).

The problem is, so I decided it was time to get Turking. I decided I was going to take a new approach until the end of the month.

Mechanical Turk is my job. When I am on MTurk, I get up and walk around the house/apartment complex a bit. Other than that, Turking. No Reddit, no Facebook, no forums, just Turking (or Textbroker if there is no Turking to be done. As long as there is money involved.)

I am tracking my earnings using a spreadsheet already

Four columns: Date, and Hourly Pay. This is a great system for me, as I enter the hours worked at the beginning of the day, which means my hourly wage only goes up as I work more. 

When I finished the spreadsheet, nothing but writing and rainymood. I did that for eight hours and it worked so well I added another hour to it. Call it overtime, whatever. At the end of the day, this was my dashboard:

http://imgur.com/PmaAM

I made $216 in nine hours today, so I am okay with it. I am going to be Turking this way from now until I can find another stable income source. I don't get weekends off until I can pay rent, but then I get weekends off.

Does anyone else do something like this? I'm not saying you have to be quite as ridiculous and strict as I am

Sure enough

The only ""past request"" I received was an email telling me to log on and go through the Verify Account Information stuff

I emailed them

Has anyone else had the same experience and could put me on the right path? I replied to the last email

EDIT: Well

EDIT2: To my lack of surprise

&gt;Hello
&gt;
I did as requested and opened a new Amazon Payments account with a new email address, birth date, and SSN. But that account is going under the same process as my first one.
&gt;
Just to clarify what happened:
&gt;
I created my account, then Verify My Account (or something similar). I entered address, phone number, birth date, and SSN again, then got an email saying my account has been restricted. 
&gt;
All of my information is completely accurate
&gt;
If there are any fixes to this problem
&gt;
Thank you! 

I'm really hoping I get somewhere with this. 

EDIT3: Despiste our rapid back-and-forth correspondance yesterday morning

EDIT4: I called up customer service on Thursday and was told that an Account Specialist would be in contact with me. I got another ""We were unable to confirm your account information"" email, so I'm going to go with what capgras_delusion said and assume it's because of the holiday season. I think I'll try again after New Year's.

EDIT5: (for anyone still reading) I just sent Amazon Payments an email to customer service, and I was told that due to new business policies, there was no way to revoke the hold on my account and to make a new account.

I was pessimistic

&gt;I am very happy Dustin is here communicating with us....just would feel a lot better seeing my work approved since I have done a lot of his HITS now.


This ""ban"" showed up shortly after RW had come back online for the first time after my post.  I cannot tell you exactly what my post said because he of course, are still there.  Go figure.  I guess I was only ""spamming"" some of the time. lulz.  But I would bet my paycheck that his ""stature"" being questioned and hurt was the reason for my banning.  I apologize that RWStein made himself look like a fool by posting something as asinine as telling people to make sure they post on TO for a reqeuster before the hits had approved/rejected but that is not my fault.

I copy and pasted her reply that she e-mailed to me. Unfortunately

""Please know that I am very sorry for the trouble my HIT and rejection have caused you. I've decided to reverse the rejection. It was my mistake to have rejected them in the first place. I didn't place the ethnicity qualifications in the ""qualifying criteria"" section in my Mechanical Turk HIT in part because I did not know that the skip logic I had added in my survey wasn't already reflecting the necessary qualifications. That skip logic is what took you to the end of the survey after you answered the survey's first 2 questions. I looked into options for adding the qualifying criteria appropriately

I hadn't placed it in the job description previously because I was afraid of the social desirability pressures for people to lie that they met the ethnicity qualifications to participate. I thought that once they answered the ethnicity question (question 2 in my survey) that they would not be considered as  ""completed surveys"" and, I looked into other options. However, ""abandoning/returning"" the work could not be handled from my end. In the meantime, I've secured more funding and I am reversing the rejections.

I hope that you will forgive me and that you would consider working with me in the future. Please allow me 3-5 business days to reverse the rejection.

Thanks
Vanessa""

TL;DR She screwed up and she is going to reverse all of our rejections and pay us the 85 cents (If I recall correctly) from the HIT.

The reply I received was...baffling. They said that because the account had been originally registered under both our names (it wasn't, and actually, b) prohibit the joint ownership of accounts and requested that I withdraw the remaining balance on my account after which the account will be permanently suspended, and bonus: I would have to open up a new account, using a different email address.

As I'm guessing you guys know, you build up a good reputation, and an approval ratio, and you qualify for better and better jobs because of those factors. Add to that, if I was going to get a new account, why would I need to use a new email address? Here are my current stats, just so you'll know what I am losing by having to start over:

HITs Submitted--744	   
* Approved-------693 (99.1%)   
* Rejected----------6 (0.9%)   
* Pending----------45	   

I went around and around with them, that my ex had nothing to do with the account, that I had been jerked around, et cetera. He said he was going to elevate my issue to an account specialist. I thanked him, and breathed a sigh of relief.

Fast forward to a week later. I'd heard nothing from Amazon, indifferent. I was finishing up a task (a rather involved one, worth a pretty good amount of money), and I got the completion code; I put the code into the HIT page, clicked submit...and got this message:

----

Your Amazon Payments account has been suspended

You will not be able to use Amazon Mechanical Turk until your Amazon Payments account is in good standing. Please contact customer service.

----

Aw, just concerning the account being suspended, not even mentioning my previous issue, because I felt like based on my prior interactions, it would only confuse the issue. 

I received a message back a few minutes ago, and that I should withdraw the remaining balance on your account after which the account will be permanently suspended. That last suggestion made me laugh, as due to the account being suspended, I couldn't withdraw any money even if I were so inclined. Add to that, I have 45 tasks still pending and unpaid, for which I estimate I am owed upwards of $15; I have around $75 in my account now. This is just depressing; I've heard of PayPal being this awful, but not Amazon.

So, I have no idea what I'm going to do. I sent a message to Consumerist, thinking this might be the kind of story they would be into, and on TurkerNation; but I'm open to advice. Thanks for reading.

**edit:** Before I had a chance to call today, yep, they were there. Sent a reply saying that they should look at my account again.

I also forward every email I've ever received that has anything to do with mTurk to Evernote. If I google, it retrieves all my status pages for that date. If I google Nelson Lau, I get every status page, HIT and email with his name on it.

Hello A      

I'm sorry for any concern regarding your Mechanical Turk earnings.

As a part of our continuous efforts to ensure that Mechanical Turk remains beneficial to both Requesters and Workers

Until the 10 active day requirement has been met, if your first HIT was approved by the requester on the 1st of the month, you will be paid on the 11th of that same month.

It may take between 24 - 48 hours for the transfer to be completed. When the transfer is complete
   
Once your account balance reflects payment of your earnings you will be able to transfer your earnings to your Amazon.com gift card balance or a verified bank account.

Again

HWTF:
So far I love this community. I think the idea of organic growth is a great thing. I only try to post quality (i think) links. Most of the surveys I post tend to be somewhat intriguing to myself and I hope others. I dont like the idea of posting specifics of AC's, didnt get any attention on what I think is a quiality HiT, or was poorly represented I might see a need to repost it. But generally, Ill try to avoid reposts. I genuinely try to be a positive and proactive member and I think many other newbies feel the same. As far as Im concerned, in this case, the more the merrier. The good posts will rise and the bad will fall, its why this style of community is great. Its self pruning.

Turking in general:
I always try to pay attention as best I can and fill out everything honestly. I think its important that everyone do the same for the integrity of the system. I have had HiTs that I genuinely enjoy and plenty of bad ones too. I enjoy learning about the human mind on a laymen level

I expect to use this to supplement my regimen of Ebay (I sell mostly video game related stuff /shameless plug), my girl by my side.

I am recently unemployed and am turking an hour or two a day while I look for another job just to have some income rather than none. In 9 days I have about $30 approved-pending payment

Without wasting gas driving to work, turking is actually an ideal source of income for a broke college student.
