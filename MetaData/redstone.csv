Timing issues with torches:

This bug obviously destroys redstone circuits that have to be timed correctly. You probably have already experienced it.



Repeater not unlocking properly:

https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC-9951

This bug might not sound like a big problem but it is in situations where high frequency memory is needed. It makes building 5 Hz memory and therefore 5 Hz CPUs impossible.

Regardless of whether or not torch burn out is necessary or even a desired feature, if there's no longer a need for redstone torch burn out there isn't much of a reason it should be kept around and there are many reasons why it should not be kept around.

I suggest that redstone ore  takes it place as a block update detector. It seems so obvious: All other redstone related blocks sends out power when they are lit/burn, and then we just make it send out power when it glows. We might need to change the time it glows when updated to, say, two ticks or something similar. When punched or walked on it can stay lit longer, like it is now.

What do you think? Haven't we abused this glitch enough? Isn't it time to get a permanent solution

Any better ideas of how to implement a BUD block?

My name's Jive

And that, I invite you to join me on this mission.  Here's some of the goals and projects I have in mind, and I'd like you to suggest some ideas of your own.

**Community Building Project Ideas**

* *Beautify the Subreddit* - As much as I love the classic look of MinecraftAddict's old-school redstone

* *Redstone Challenges* - What do you think of having weekly or monthly subreddit redstone challenges.  I have a few ideas brainstormed, and for your reddit reward I'll be making custom flairs for the challenge champions!

* *Redstone Reviews* - I have been recording minecraft videos for a while, depends on interest.  But if you'd like to participate, send me a PM and I'll try to feature your creation on camera  - you can even join me on a server and we can talk about your build together!  Don't worry, I don't bite!  (sorry if I can't get to everyone!)

* *Community Tutorials* - Another thing I think would be nice would be a subreddit wiki for tutorials and walkthroughs to help increase our numbers.  I'd love to see you all contribute whatever unique expertise you have to the project

* *Community Server* - /u/tomiy11 has suggested that we start a dedicated /r/redstone server.  I will be looking into this option and will post again about it in the near future.  We will need dedicated and competent admins.  I may be able to fund the server myself

I'll be posting again about each of the projects as they come to fruition.  So

1373572987.0,1i3qxz,[PSA] Grum issues a challenge to prove that fixing quasiconnectivity won't make things impossible (X-Post from /r/Minecraft),WolfieMario,21,5,14,"([Original Post](http://nb.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1i1a4y/psa_grum_issues_a_challenge_to_prove_that_fixing/))

About a week ago

However, a challenge:
&gt;Actually it is working as intended because it is a bug turned feature by demand of the community. Would you rather have is break all existing maps and make certain constructs impossible?

&gt;Try making a 10x10 wall of pistons that all move together without this quasiconnectivity (use that mod above).

&gt;If you can make alternatives for all the existing structures we might consider it.

Quite shortly thereafter

I'm personally of the opinion that no useful redstone devices will be made *impossible* by fixing the bug, please clarify if I'm wrong!) - we know for a fact that fixing the bug won't break *all* existing maps (this can be trivially proven; I can do so if requested), so chances are we don't literally have to recreate *all* existing structures in Minecraft before Grum will consider it.

That being said

Ideas for discussion:

* Structures/devices which are ""impossible"" if the bug is fixed

* Structures/devices which are ""impossible"" unless the bug is fixed
structures even with the bug

* The idea of adding new blocks to supplement bugged or bug-free behavior (including BUD blocks

* How this bug effects your redstone experience

Please keep the discussion calm; I've seen previous discussions on this bug go up in flames. There's no reason to insist on one side being superior; rather, rather than actually making the decision.

Feel free to leave your comments here if you want

I've not seen these used anywhere but I use them quite often simply as they're so compact.

Signal comes in via one repeater

**Notes:**

This design can be a bit finicky
Depending on where you are in the world certain combinations of directions simply wont generate an output.

At certain coords you can even dispense with the incoming repeater and power the block/piston directly with just redstone wire.

I've not noticed a pattern but I'm sure there's a reason for this.",,t5_2scnv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/redstone/comments/l3zug/super_compact_pulse_limiter/

    -Conditions of objectives based on other objectives

Often times if you need to go vertically with redstone something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wQjXwh.jpg) works fine. But

That's where these come in.


* 
**Sand powered**


The first ones use sand and gravity to operate. They're small


**[Version #1](http://i.imgur.com/vEK7Fh.png)**  

Is the simplest


**[Version #2](http://i.imgur.com/KyCue.png)**  

Is more complex,  which makes sure that it operates whatever you have it hooked correctly. It's very fast, but breaks easily.


* **Piston Powered: Button version.**



**[Version #1](http://i.imgur.com/KGQJJ.png)**  

Is fairly simple, and turns on the reset circuit, which after running through a delay fires the top piston resetting the post.  [Another shot, straight down at the top.](http://i.imgur.com/2blvJ.png)


**[Version #2](http://i.imgur.com/lBpo5.png)** 

 Is the same as the first one
[Another](http://i.imgur.com/S9WfN.png) view.  and one more from the [top.](http://i.imgur.com/PnJPX.png)
This one can be chained together for however high you need to go.


**[Version #3](http://i.imgur.com/XcDLrh.png)** 

Isn't really a switch at all, a large, completely useless piston wall.
[Side](http://i.imgur.com/NHgobh.png) and 
[Front.](http://i.imgur.com/wANzPh.png) 


* ** Piston powered: Switch version.**

**[Version #1](http://i.imgur.com/Pub3Uh.png)** 

 Uses two columns, hooked to the switch, is a [pulse generator.](http://i.imgur.com/R8whDh.png)  When you turn the switch off it fires a short pulse, which raises the post on the left which in turn activates the[ reset circuit](http://i.imgur.com/2ACZHh.png) for both columns. It's not quite as fast as the button version, but it is very sturdy.


**[Version #2](http://i.imgur.com/AnsF4h.png)** 

The same as version #1. Only it shows how you can place to reset and pulse generator wherever you want. Useful for fitting into tight places.


A few notes:

I'm sure that, I haven't seen them, and I thought it'd be useful to have this info collected into one place.

This isn't meant to be a end all list. It's meant to be a helpful guide and a jumping off point. Feel free to take these designs and expand on them. As with most things in Minecraft there's always a better way to make stuff

* [Even more minecart science with powered rail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSwdx8c6n4Y)

Here's my conclusions:

* It's not effective to use powered rails the way you use booster carts. Instead
* In order to go uphill at top speed
* In order to maintain an occupied cart at top speed on level ground you need a powered rail every 30 blocks.
* In order to maintain an unoccupied cart at top speed on level ground you need a powered rail every other block.

It seems like it would be a lot of fun. I would start a contest like this but a contest needs **PRIZES!!!** so it wont work if i don't have any.

I thought it should be here instead.

Original post:http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/13lg2o/ideathe_obfuscated_redstone_contest/

Sorry for messing up the title.

[edit] The idea of the contest is to do the craziest or longest stuff with redstone just to do a simple task.

1. May exploit any redstone bugs.

2. Must be done on a flat sandstone world.

3. Must do something simple retracting piston turning on lights ETC...

^2 When making the player detector, I know.

Note that those are SSP ONLY

Now

* Inventory activated redstone (IAR):

Basicly, almost. 

Stair-based receiver loses there collision masks if you have a stair ITEM of the same type in your visible inventory. And It cant be any inventory: It will be activated by stairs in chest or even TMI's interface.

So you can activate redstone things by looking into your inventory

* Cursor detector: 

Show the video I posted above to any of your minecraft friend

Basicly, now called X, vary from a world to another, but once you found the right distance, it stay consistent), stair items on the ground will count as in your inventory, but only if THEY ARE WITHIN YOUR SCREEN. 

They can be behind blocks, with a very good precision.

* Player detector:
 Most of you may knom the paricles based player detectors will be broken in 1.3. Good news: this one still works (and is way better

Remember that I said that stair on the ground onl count as items if you are more than X block from the receiver? Well

That mean that by building multiple receivers, I used 4 detectors to detect if the player is walking on a certain BLOCK.
And since you can have up to 6 types of receivers (I think

I'm sure someone will find another useful and amazing use of this feature. I just wanted to post it there
