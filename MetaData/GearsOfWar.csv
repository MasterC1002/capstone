Now let me take the time to explain why I absolutely despise this game.

Campaign: While the actual gameplay of the campaign was fun

Moving on to multiplayer...
Jesus H. Christ I could sit here for hours complaining about this but ill try to keep it as short as possible. 

Weapon Loadouts: I think Epic was doing this to try to diversify the Loadouts and make people collaborate roles. Well that fucking backfired. This addition only narrowed it down even further. In your average game of TDM you will maybe see 1 or 2 people using anything other than the gnasher and about halfway through the game they get fed up and either quit or start using the gnasher because there is almost no way to do good if you don't use it. The sawed off is absolutely useless now. Why use it when it is basically a gnasher with 1/4th of the clip. The hammerburst

Melee: Need I say more?

Verticality: This could have been a wonderful addition to the series if they didn't shit the bed in map design. Instead of simply adding in the feature

Map Design: Simply put. It sucks dick. Spawn points are beyond imbalanced. Lack of symmetry eliminates any tactical gameplay from the game. I swear upon my soul I have not deaths from behind than I have in all the other gear games combined. 

Grenades: ""Well you spawn with grenades in Call of Duty

No Locust in Multiplayer: Don't know why they didn't include them. Maybe they were afraid COD players would be intimidated by them but who knows.

Lack of Characters: Didn't wanna put any more time and effort to design more for this game I guess. 

Good Points: 
OverRun is fun. 
Declassified missions are fun. However I think thy should just include this in an arcade mode instead. 
That's all I've got. Thanks for reading those of you that did. Please leave your thoughts about the game in the comments. 

TL;DR Epic and PCF shit the bed with this game and i am utterly disappointed. ",nsfw,t5_2ruzg,False,,cogcarmineb,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1c6beo/judgements_multiplayer_sucks_there_i_said_it/

I cannot understand some of these design decisions they made for the competitive multiplayer. Here's my list:

*  There are only 3 competitive game modes: FFA
* You can only pick one starting gun. This poses a huge problem as you place yourself at a severe disadvantage when using any guns other than the Gnasher or the Retro-Lancer. But then you cannot compete with trolls who are using long-range weapons. It's like you *are forced to choose between sucking close-range or sucking long-range* as opposed to the game being balanced.
* You can no longer plant grenades? What gives?
* There is no more DBNO (down but not out). This was SUCH a unique part of the game that I really enjoyed. What were they thinking? I loved that I could curb-stomp somebody that was chasing me forever
* You can now use the boom shield with any gun. Stupid.
* No more perfect active reloads. (This one isn't so bad. I can see why. Jus' sayin'.)
* The maps are WAY too big for the Gears of War style of play. I played these games competitively to play intense close quarters battles with your team all near you and reviving each other etc. Say bye bye to this. TDM is basically now like Call of Duty where your team just serves as human shields and a basis to know where the enemy is. Teamwork is not necessary and does not help.
* Possibly the biggest beef: no COG vs. Locust??? AND only ~10 COG characters to choose from? Holy hell


All of these things made Gears of War extremely unique and adrenaline-inducing to play. I really wish they could just add a section of multiplayer modes labeled ""Classic"" or the-like and add Gears of War 3 style game modes where you can pick two starting weapons. It wouldn't fix all of the things I find putrid about it, grenades and grenade mechanics.

Now let the downvotes ensue. ",self,t5_2ruzg,1363830154.0,,wepgnash,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1ap9i7/everything_unique_about_gears_of_war_competitive/

1364059543.0,1av84z,Tips on how to enjoy GOWJ,cevo70,89,14,94,"I am not going to say I love all the changes, for sure.  The campaign is still great (especially co-op) and I'd like to make a case that all of the MP changes aren't worth getting angry about.  

Here's what I suggest. 

1.  Stop comparing it to other franchises.   It's pointless.   It's still miles away from Halo or CoD.

2.  Accept and enjoy that you'll need to adapt new strategies.  Many of the changes that get ripped on, but they also dictated strategies that got stale.   Firing off blank shots to get active, and gnasher-downing people from 15 feet away....eh.   It was def effective, but silly and annoying to be on the receiving end of.   Planting grenades was all sorts of effective, but even though I was very good at it, it's pretty f'n cheap.  I could go on, but the point is that stripping some of the old ""features"" goes a long way towards refining an effective

3.  Fly around in a fucking helicopter.  Practice with the new weapons, but it's not that mad rush to the middle either.  It requires new approaches and play styles.   It's refreshing. 

4.  Try beating 10 rounds of Survival.   It's not horde

5.  Remember that you can still be elite, you can't do what used to work.  You don't rush the 2-3 power weapons - they aren't centralized as clearly as they used to be.  Get the ones closer to you - grab ammo crates because you'll need it and the extra grenade is key.  I've had more success traveling around perimeters quickly.   

6. Think about picking a role via your primary/grenade - I've seen some very effect hammer-bursters using tactical/support grenades

7.  The maps are very different in design.  Elevation is much more intricate.  They are far less symmetrical overall.   Learning the routes and right places to lurk around solo

I can understand some of the complaints

1367565719.0,1dlvuk,GOW:J Massive Update Info,-bam,66,4,84,"Massive updates that should go live soon, etc.:

- Dual weapon loadout will be propegated to all playlists with the exception of FFA.
- Stim grenades will be removed from all playlists with the exception of FFA.
- Torquebow charge time reduced back to Gears 3 Active levels (from 2 seconds down to 1.5 seconds).
- Prize boxes updated in the next TU to deliver all content before doling out XP (instead of assigning randomly).

We also went through the community feedback list and looked at everything we could. Here's a rehash of our response from tonight's live stream event:


I. Maps / Content

A. Only 4 traditional multiplayer maps
Map counts increased significantly with current and future DLC. Everyone has had great feedback on what they'd like to see in the future, stay tuned!

B. Maps are not symmetrical
DLC maps are either symmetrical or much more symmetrical than release maps. Think layouts that are “more Haven

C. Maps are too big
Future DLC map designs are smaller and/or flow better so that combat is less segregated. We’re also setting up hard swaps that focus the action along the midline for Execution.

D. Updates are only “Server side”
We have made an effort to get changes up and tested as early as possible so that we can include them in the required title updates. This will ensure that a good number of the changes are actually present in a LAN setting. We’re also posting change notes and trying to be proactive with communication before changes are implemented.

E. No Locusts in standard versus multiplayer
This cannot be changed at this point. We can

 
II. Melee

A. Reverse 2 Piece possible
We’ve adjusted melee pretty significantly to address these issues. If melee is in the game, and adjusting it too much further will create the unnatural delays and obstructions to gameplay that we have previously removed in response to your feedback on this very topic.

B. Speed
See above.

C. Range
We have not seen a range difference


III. Matchmaking / Ranked (Incentive)

A. Too many playlists
We’re still working on solutions to this problem

B. Ranked vs. Quick match Experience earned
Ranked XP will be increased. We’re working on some other incentives to draw people into Ranked as well (more “competitive-style settings”

C. Little incentive to play ranked
Judgment does indeed use skill-based ranking as part of its matchmaking algorithm. In point of fact, however, that don’t require a full redesign of our matchmaking, UI, and infrastructure.


IV. Weapon Balancing (Spawn / Power)

A. Gnasher
We’re working on a fix to allow players the option to toggle their on-screen reticule. The close range “inconsistency” people report is actually an intentional fix that favors the player to ensure they get a proper kill when the barrel of the gun is touching another player’s cylinder. An ammo count change is highly contentious in public forums

B. Lancer
A change to the Lancer may indeed favor competitive players who intend on using it in a support capacity. However

Changing to a two-weapon loadout is unlikely to create a huge imbalance in the weapons. The reality of the game stats is that within a few seconds of spawning, so pulling that back to spawn doesn’t significantly move the needle in terms of game balance.

That said, and see how it plays out. We’ll do that ASAP. We’ll start with the clip size reduction and make further updates if necessary.

C. Booshka
Agreed. Clip size and starting ammo being reduced.

D. Boomshot
Agreed. Starting ammo being reduced.



V. Grenade Balancing

A. Ink Grenade
Internal QA is looking into the reported issues. More info to follow.

B. Stim Grenade
Stim grenade being removed from loadout and moved to a pickup in some playlists.

C. Ammo boxes
We’ll try pulling grenades out of ammo boxes in the Test Server


VI. Audio (In-Game)

A. Sound isn’t accurately location based
We can’t realistically change our sound engine at this point, but that would require a Title Update to implement, and another to change back if the change isn’t well received. Probably too risky at this point.



VII. Glitches

A. Movement
Not getting into cover is due to a series of complicated factors that are made more apparent by Judgment’s increase in game speed and player density. We’ll look into it

B. Characters
Kim’s hitbox already fixed in the upcoming TU.

Boomshield already adjusted on female characters in the upcoming TU.

I’m not 100% clear on the characters failing to show visual recognition on successive shots, etc.) then I don’t see this as a major problem. Will need to investigate further.

C. In Game
If players can join a private game


VIII. Final Suggestions

A. Domination Gametype
Changed time to break hills from 2 seconds to 1 second.

B. Upgrade spectator mode (mega wish)
Extremely out of scope for Judgment

C. Theater mode (mega wish)
Extremely out of scope for Judgment

Since Judgment hit the shelves

I am sick of all this complaining. You know what? Epic didn't put a gun to your head or anyone else who bought this game and forced y'all to spend money on it. They didn't hide anything in the videos before the game dropped. Y'all know that there was only going to be 4 maps. Y'all knew that there were load outs now. Y'all knew that there would be new weapons. It is a new game for heavens sake. 

By the way, and 3 are still up and running. No one is forcing you to play the game. No one forced you to play it in the first place. It was YOUR decision to walk in, buy it and play it regardless of all the videos and the early access that y'all saw and played. 

Stop the bitching for all that is holy. Stop complaining that the game isn't like Gears 3 or how bad certain things are. Go back to the game that you want Judgment to be like and stay there. 

I love this franchise

No game is going to be perfect. No game is going to please everyone. Bitching about every little item on this subreddit or on Twitter is going to do nothing. 

It is sad to see this subreddit be nothing but complaining when it should be filled with discussion

I have been on this subreddit for a while and am honestly very close to leaving for good because of how ridiculous the complaining is about every little element of this game. 


Do with this thread whatever y'all want. Downvote it, etc. I know there are more of y'all around who enjoy the game for what it is than those who hate it and if not, that's seriously sad and shows what the games industry has become. 

Either way

Thanks y'all.

1330015663.0,q2o4a,Lets Organize Another Tournament Like the Good'Ole Days,Sinopsis,44,12,94,"It's been a *long* time sense I've started up another tournament for us. I believe the last one was back when we had somewhere around 1

I loved the tournaments and had a blast and it's where I met most of the guys and gals I play with on Gears now. So for those of you who are new and curious about the tournaments we held. Here's a quick run-down.

First tournament was 1v1's. We had about 8 people show up with the final 3 being Detestify

Second tournament was also fun. It was xXManWithAPlanX's team (I believe Mr.R4IN, Simfox, MR.Mocca and myself. Manwithaplan's team won earning the red omen skull with the crown as flair.

These are the only two successful Reddit-Gears tournaments held thus far. I tried a wingman tournament and even created a flair for it (a trophy with wings) but we only had 2-3 sign-ups and so I was forced to cancel it. 

But now since we have so many more people and I would simply love to meet more Reddit-Gears players I will organize another competition for us all!

Yes there will be prizes besides flair. xXManWithAPlanXx won a poster that I bought for being MVP of this winning team (because of mailing issues it isn't sent yet

Edit: **The awesome employee known as Troy Mcklure (has an Epic flair next to his name) has contacted other employees to provide prizes for the tournaments such as exclusive characters. Which is better than my lame flair and posters!**

This thread will be in the sidebar along with additional information about past tournaments. So check it regularly!
*****
*****
Edit: **The other mods and I have decided that no matter what game-type is chosen. You must have had a Reddit account  prior to the announcement of the tournament. AND your account must be verified. Once I open sign-ups you will have to send me a message with your gamertag so I may check your legitimacy. Otherwise we will have MLG players coming in solely to win the great prizes being handed out.**


**Now my friends and fellow gear-heads. What do *you* think?**







**TL;DR: This is a 2v2 tournament with prizes being handed out by Epic themselves.**
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****

After MUCH discussion and planning with the other mods here is everything that is going on! Sign up is being posted now but I urge you to read **EVERYTHING** from here down:

The playtypes will be:

 **2v2 Execution**; 4 rounds; 5 minutes each; hypefestation weapon spawns (everything is the same except there are *no* boltoks or gorgons). This also means there is no Hammerburst/Retro/or Sawed-off allowed at ANY point in this competition.

**2v2 KotH**; First team to 210; 1 round. Same weapon spawns as execution.


The playtypes go in the following order: Execution


The prize distribution: As Troy stated he has a character code for each character available. That makes a total of 5 character codes. A season pass code and the secret prize.

Once all teams are eliminated (it's single elimination) the final two teams will face off. The winners of the entire tournament then 1v1 each other (WHAT A TWIST!). The winner of this 1v1 gets first choice from one of ANY of the prizes that have been mentioned. (DLC character, which is what we wanted. All of the remaining codes will be raffled off between all other players that did win. (Using a random number generator corresponding with the seed numbers given to you when you sign up) Rotaz broke it down for us here.

1st pick: Winning team - winner of 1v1


2nd pick: Winning team - loser of 1v1


3rd pick: Losing team - winner of 1v1


4th pick: Losing team - lower of 1v1


Then raffle off the remaining 3 prizes. This way it avoids any kind of unfairness due to the fact that there are teams of 2 and prizes of different value.

As for the matches themselves: **YOU** are responsible for fighting the team that you are assigned to fight. It will be up to you for you guys to get together and fight. Then report the scores (with proof) to me. Once you sign up I will announce the beginning of the tournament on this thread Next Weekend on Saturday (not tomorrow).

I will THEN post what teams need to face off within the next 48 hour period. If you have NOT fought the opposing team within that 48 period both teams will forfeit and I move on to the next team match-up.

I would **LOVE** for someone to record each match with a capture card so I can make a compilation video and get some peeps to commentate it for me. A ""Highlights"" reel if you wish. So if you have a capture card let me know and I'll put your name on this thread. (Include your gamertag) 

If there name is listed under here then before each match PLEASE try to get in contact with one of them through Reddit or Xbox Live before your assigned match:
None

None

None

None

None

Sign-Up: Ok read this **CAREFULLY** I realize that some of you do not have a 2v2 partner. So when you sign up I want you to put your gamertag with an asterisk (Synopsi*) next to it so I know that you are by yourself and I will pair you randomly with one of the other players who are also by themselves. There is a 16 team limit so sign up quickly!

As for teams: You must put this in the CORRECT FORMAT: ""&lt;Team Name&gt;-&lt;Member One&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;Member Two&gt;"". You must USE YOUR ACTUAL gamertag. This way I can contact you in case of a change.

That's it for now guys! Sign Up --**SIGN UP CLOSED**

**REMEMBER TO SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT CONTAINING YOUR GAMERTAG SO I CAN VERIFY**
*****
**ALSO**: People are confused how this will work. So once again, A PICTURE OR VIDEO WILL BE FINE. UNLESS BOTH TEAMS AGREE TO WHO WON/LOST, I EXPECT REPORTS FROM BOTH SIDES.). When I post the teams that are facing off I will post their names and gamertags so you know who to contact. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

**SIGN-UP IS NOW CLOSED**

I really did it, then began my journey, approximately 1:15 AM. I beat Gears one in about 7 and a half hours, then began Gears Two. That took me MUCH longer, starting from 9:00 AM to Midnight, although I DID stop for food breaks and a powernap. From there, I worked on Gears 3 until 5 AM, finishing by 3 PM. The grand total of my time was 1 and a half days. I also kept track of my deaths. I died a total of 405 times, but it's definitely the one I had the most trouble with. I consumed 4 energy drinks to stay awake and only ate 2 sandwiches and a bowl of cereal to avoid taking too much extra time. It was fun. Hard

I love Gears as a series, multiplayer, co-op, I'll be playing this for a number of years, I think (I *just* stopped playing BFBC2 religiously when GOW3 came out). I would probably have paid forty bucks for a disk that just had Horde on it.

All that said, and if halflife three comes out... well, I still have havent finished episode 2.  Or episode 1.  Or HL2.  So, no, the fact that PC centric r/gaming doesn't like Gears as much as me doesn't effect me in the slightest.  People often dislike things I like, and I'm sure the same is true for almost all of us.

What bugs me *a little* is the assumption that anyone who plays console games is a either a slobbering moron, or 12.  Or some combination of the three.  What *pisses me off* is how often this is true.  In three of my last eight games played, the first thing over the mic was some white kid introducing himself with ""What's up, Niggers?""  Different kids, different modes, same stupid shit over the mic.  I had one kid talk incessantly for 23 waves of Horde, ""Sup, dawg, I haven't found it. 

I've been playing primarily on consoles for 24 years.  I play PC games, I'm a console gamer.  And like many of you (I'm sure) I **hate the shit out of a lot of other console gamers.**

GvS back peddle

SvS straight bounce battle

SvG I really wouldn't recommend it but if you do want to try it you've got to keep your enemy from using the range advantage

     -The starting rifles

-Lancer, don't kill yourself trying to switch if they're closing in , the stopping power can leave them dead in their tracks

So here is what I'm looking to do. I want to compile the ULTIMATE guide to everything Gears. Story, etc etc, across the entire Gears of War mythos, level tips for EVERY map in the Gears catalogue. I'm talking best places to snipe, how to hold rings in KOTH / Domination, etc, as well as weapon combinations for Judgement. I also want to include a ***very*** brief Achievement how-to list


* **Target Audience**: Professionals who are looking to fine-tune their Gears experience


* **Execution of Guide**: Obviously, as well as a bunch of DLC for Gears 1 (and the first paid DLC for Judgement), so it'd be kinda hard to do a map section for those, plus since I'm dealing with personal matters (Father is getting ready to go into Chemo for Lung Cancer, plus I'm devoting a bunch of time to look for work), I won't have a whole lot of time to making the guide.


* **How you can help**: If you have any tips, please feel free to post them in the thread! If you stumble upon overhead maps (preferably with weapon spans included) (you know, the ones you see before EVERY match), upload them to [Imgur](http://imgur.com), and post them in the thread! If you wanna help by donating (though I don't know anyone who WOULD, but it'd be greatly appreciated), you can send me a PM, so that you can donate that way, so I'll know who to thank when we are finished.

* **Guide Status:** Started. If you want to see what I have, etc etc. Message me with an email address if you wish to add and help contribute to the guide. 


If you wanna help me out with certain 'Myths' (Will a Grenade still explode after you die, so please bear with me while my newish one is on its way.*

1356930622.0,15pk6c,I've always loved the Gears community! But it's time to vent.,BacardiandCoke,29,9,21,"[TL;DR: I was pretty upset with Flak the moderator at the Epic forums.](http://imgur.com/a/uZbyA)

Nothing could pull me away from Halo2. For 2 years I played only Halo2. Until Gears came out. It became the go to game for my son and I. We bonded big time over GOW2 and got him his own gold profile. He passed me up in skill no problem even though I've been a gamer since pong. Even though I would drag him down wingman

We spent a fortune on the Gears franchise. Owning 3 copies of GOW, GOW3, map packs, weapon skins, clothes, figures, etc...

Not only were the games fun, building a 90% GOW friend list.

And then my son decides he's going to modify a weapon skin. Stupid teenager thing to do. And the ban hammer comes down hard. All 4 xbox live gold accounts on our xbox banned. My 2 other sons and I are devastated. I head to the forums to find out what my son had done. I tried to reason with the forum moderators and Epic games. Just ban HIM I said, AKA iFlak on XBL) said. One of my sons lives away from home I argued, he's banned because his profile has been on my xbox before. Too bad, they said. 

Now I can see if he was modifying things to have an unfair advantage in online competition. But a weapon skin? I was away on business when it happened. My son was so scared to tell me because it was the only game I played from the day it came out. So I said goodbye to my friends on the Epic forums. Told my tale of woe

So a few months later my Xbox elite disk drive dies. God forbid my gaming household go without one while I order a new diskdrive. So we get a new one and it comes with a free month of gold. Well I was having some cocktails that night and my son and I bonded one last time over Gears. [Venting our frustration we created a new account just for the beloved Flak over at the Epic forums.](http://imgur.com/a/uZbyA)

Petty and childish I know. But we laughed together so it was worth it. Still deciding if we will pick up Judgment or not. Hard not to, so who knows. Maybe I'll make the boy buy it. Yea, that will probably work.

Ok

Let's say, either by foot, land vehicle, or even air vehicle. The goal is of course to capture, secure and defend as many locations as possible against locust hordes. 

Now, or roll through in a Centaur, or an Armadillo, etc and rush over there to assist them. 

Conversely, Reavers, etc. 

Additionally, and supplies would be scattered throughout the open world. So, as you travel between locations you can pick them up.

It would allow for the most epic scale Gears battles ever. Every capture and every lost location would take place in real time and ultimately effect the outcome of the war. 

It would truly be a ""Battle for Sera

1346694010.0,zaeyp,Gears of War RPG?,mattyfressh,31,11,11,"I was thinking, but it is a work in progress like I said. 

So you start the game as a stranded. Then the world would be set up like Dragon Age games or like the Fable games. I don't think it would work to well under a completely open game world such as Skyrim. The time period could be debatable but I think that as you complete the main  mission of the game it would progress through time. 

Now there could be an experience system put in place where you level up as you go. Also when you level up you can increase certain statistics such as melee, etc. Now also this means you could possibly have different classes to start the game. These classes could be the same classes for the upcoming GOW: Judgment (Scout, Soldier, Engineer, Medic). These classes could obviously have different attributes to them. Such as the Scout has the ability to sneak and is more accurate with the sniper, Soldier has more health and does more damage, Engineer can repair vehicles and weapons

I think that the game should start before the first game, because in a world that it is set in, it would mostly be trading one item for another. 

Now the weapons I feel you could add a few more for melee since ammo would be scarce. The melee weapons could be anything from a baseball bat to a knife that you add for melee. Also

Maybe you could also set it up like Borderlands where someone can join someone else's game and you can play through it with 2-4 people. 

Now there is obviously plenty more thought that needs to be put into this

**1: You're going to die unreasonably from time to time.**

Make no mistake about it

**2: Be constantly looking for what the enemy is carrying.**

This is something that I'm still working on since I got the game and I'm still not perfect but it's a skill that has helped me a lot versus the SOS. Look at an approaching enemy, whip out a rifle or popshot his ass. Simple as that.

**3: Is someone roadie running straight at you?**

Guess what? He's not running in for a hug--he's got the SOS. And guess what? You probably won't be able to kill him first with a Gnasher

**4: Lateral movements = bad versus SOS**

It's no secret that the SOS has a very fucking wide spread. It's my normal reaction when in a shotgun duel to move laterally but I've realized that because of the wide spread, just anticipating a SOS.

**5: Okay

So many times have I made a SOS player miss only to have him run away from me. First thing's first: do not try to down him with your Gnasher. It'll rarely work and he will get away. Don't be afraid to pull out the old rifle and try to finish the job.

Giving chase is a good idea as well--just don't get too close. He'll be reloaded before you know it. The better idea is to give chase but keep to mid-range and pressure him with rifle fire.",self,t5_2ruzg,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/ktw49/heres_how_ive_been_owning_sawedoff_players/

**A little info on Canadian pre-order bonuses:**

I spoke with Amazon.ca today

Walmart is taking pre-orders in person, but I haven't confirmed it yet (the electronics department guy I spoke with didn't know what the bonus was).

Best Buy is taking pre-orders for standard edition (http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/gears-of-war-3-xbox-360/10144575.aspx) and giving Mechanic Baird as a pre-order bonus. They are also not selling Epic or Limited editions.

And Gamestop (EB Games in Canada) has been offering pre-orders on everything, and what the MM bonus would be, around late August.

*************

EDIT (August 1st):

Added Aaron Griffin unlock. This code

Also added the Microsoft exclusive Green (sort of liquid-y skin). Rod Fergusson, but he didn't say how. Rod also mentioned that the COG Gear, voiced by the Old Spice guy (Isaiah Mustafa) would have a golden helmet, also unlockable in-game.

EDIT: (August 15th):

Added Infected Omen

1330322124.0,q7ril,Important Tournament Information,Sinopsis,26,8,21,"Ok so the first thread has kinda become a clusterluck (see what I did there?) of different stuff. So to clarify completely on the rules and how this tournament will be taking place next weekend.

&gt;What are the gametypes and what order are we playing them in?

We will be playing the following with the following rules:

Execution; 4 rounds, Retro, or Sawed-Off).

KotH; 1 round, Retro, or Sawed-Off).

After much discussion between us mods over what gametypes, and a KotH tiebreaker in the case of a tie.

Yes, no disputes (unless of course a vital rule as stated above is violated of course). You lose.

&gt; Well how are we going to get the matches together?

This is kinda confusing so follow along: On Saturday

&gt;What about no-shows?

In the event that a team is NOT able to get in contact with its competitor the team that has PROOF (show me a sentbox screenshot on reddit and a picture of you sending a message to them over xbox) will automatically advance to the next round (Lucky you!). If a member of your team doesn't show up then...well...you're screwed. If you can find a last-minute replacement and they are a Redditor and you can verify them I will allow it. You can also try to 1v2 the opposing team. 

&gt;Didn't you say you wanted to record these matches?

Yes! For the love of all that is holy yes! I want people to spectate these matches for me and record using a video capture card of some sort and send me the footage

&gt;How are prizes being distributed?


Once all teams are eliminated (it's single elimination) the final two teams will face off. The winners of the entire tournament then 1v1 each other (WHAT A TWIST!). The winner of this 1v1 gets first choice from one of ANY of the prizes that have been mentioned. (DLC character, which is what we wanted. All of the remaining codes will be raffled off between all other players that did win. (Using a random number generator corresponding with the seed numbers given to you when you sign up) Rotaz broke it down for us here.

1st pick: Winning team - winner of 1v1


2nd pick: Winning team - loser of 1v1


3rd pick: Losing team - winner of 1v1


4th pick: Losing team - lower of 1v1


Then raffle off the remaining 3 prizes. This way it avoids any kind of unfairness due to the fact that there are teams of 2 and prizes of different value.

This will also give EVERYONE a chance

&gt;Well all this is awesome but how do I sign up?!

Sign-Up: Ok read this **CAREFULLY** I realize that some of you do not have a 2v2 partner. So when you sign up I want you to put your gamertag with an asterisk (Synopsi*) next to it so I know that you are by yourself and I will pair you randomly with one of the other players who are also by themselves. There is a 16 team limit so sign up quickly!

As for teams: You must put this in the CORRECT FORMAT: ""&lt;Team Name&gt;-&lt;Member One&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;Member Two&gt;"". You must USE YOUR ACTUAL gamertag. This way I can contact you in case of a change.

That's it for now guys! Sign Up----**TOURNAMENT SIGN-UP CLOSED**----

**REMEMBER TO SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT CONTAINING YOUR GAMERTAG SO I CAN VERIFY**

&gt;How many teams have signed up so far?

So far: 16 teams. So sign-up while you can!

KillingEdge brought to my attention the host advantage problem. If anyone besides the video capture card people would be willing to host some of these matches it would be GREATLY appreciated, nothing more. They must spectate.

Battlefield runs on dedicated servers, weeks, and even months. I think this is an awesome idea that Epic 
should implement for Gears of war 3. It would be amazing to be able to create servers
but where it always fell short was it's lack of customization. Halo and Battlefield have this down but no Gears. To be honest this really baffles me because Gears is so much fun
on its own that adding customization to it would increase its lifespan tenfold.

I mean who wouldn't want to see a Gnasher match on Thrashball with five Thrashball Coles versus five Thrashball Drones? 


Well this is what I think Epic should implement if they ever give us this awesome oppurtunity. 

First of all I think we should be able to Name our server and give it a description.

For example I would name my server ""Gears of War Classic""

Description: Gears of War 3 tweaked to play like the original. Loadout set to Lancer and Gnasher, and Custom Map cycles.

Firstly I would like to pick a map cycle and when choosing a map
For example I don't like the digger replacing the sniper rifle on Jacinto so I would swap that out and make the boltok replace the Gorgon indefinetly on this map. 
I should be able to tweak everything map related for my server, etc.

Then I would pick certain gametypes for my server to choose from, Warzone and Guardian.
I should then be able to tweak certain settings to my liking for each gamemode.
For example
For Team Deathmatch i would make it one round but give each team a lifepool of 40 and remove the man-up rule. 
Execution would be 5 second revive and again
Warzone I am somehwat unfamiliar with but I would remove the man up rule and make the bleed-out time 20 seconds.

Epic should give us a lot more customization, loadout and even ammo counts for each weapon. 
Personally I think the boomshot only needs two rounds should I should be able to set that so on my server I know that the boomshot is a viable option to rush for but it 
will not decimate a team during an Execution/Warzone match.

Also
these kind of matches would be great. I would like a silly match where everyone has pink lancers weating tophats and only being able to chainsaw each other. 
Heck I even love the Gnasher matches but I would remove the pistol completely and disable the active damage for maximum balance. 
Being able to completely control your server would make the game so good

Think about it Epic

Until next time

Once again your friendly neighborhood mod is working on a way for people from our subreddit to post on a calendar when they would want to play. And people can comment or message the person saying that they will attend. Or just show up. 

This will increase the amount of Redditors that play together and make our sub-reddit even closer then it already is.


**Edit: Ok so I thought of a clever way to do it:**

I've created a google calendar for our sub-reddit. You will NEED a gmail account to participate in this. It doesn't take long just go to www.gmail.com and create an account then go to the calendars section and add gowreddit@gmail.com: I will accept the request and that will allow you to edit and look at the events available. Make your own events or join in on someone elses! This will make our community much more involved with each other and produce all-around more fun.


Thanks everyone I hope this works!

Hit me up with any ideas you guys have or renditions to my plan.
