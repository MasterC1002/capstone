Makes a lot of bread. Probably 6-8 servings.

Ingredients:

2.5 cu flour

.5 tsp baking soda

.5 tsp baking powder

1 tsp salt

1 tbl ground cumin

1 tsp sugar

1 egg

1 cu milk

.5 cu yogurt

1 tbl vegetable oil + oil to cook in

To make:

Mix together the dry ingredients. Add the yogurt, and oil and stir. It will be quite thick. You can add more milk to thin it if you like. Let it sit and come together for about 10-20 minutes. 

Heat a frying pan over *low* heat. This is key.

Put oil in the pan and spoon the dough in

Eat!

It is very good warm with a bit of butter. Would be good with strawberries and cream as a shortcake. Would be good with chilli. It's just basically good.

I've discovered you the other day, but I digress. The point is, I'm currently discovering that a lot of things I used to buy readymade in the supermarket are fun and surprisingly easy to do myself. And that's why I'm very happy that this subreddit exists and looking forward to trying many of the things posted here.

What concerns me, existing large subreddits. Yes, there isn't a lot of traffic in here (yet), but the early posts set the tone.

To finally get to what I mean

For example, that's just normal [(/r/)baking](http://www.reddit.com/r/baking). There is a lot of overlap with places like /r/breadit and generally /r/cooking in here, where you can reach a much wider audience and get better feedback from people who really know their stuff.

* Basic Ingredients:

1.5 cups Semolina flour

.5 cup AP flour (AP seems to 'glue' the semolina together)

Two Large Eggs

2 TB Water

2 TB Oil

Quarter tsp salt

* Optional Ingredients:

Spices- preferably powdered or finely ground

Flavored Oils - Truffle oil works really well (MylesMDT mentioned basil oil

Flavored Liquids in place of water- Soy sauce 

Herbs- fresh or dried

Misc- prepared horseradish, bacon fat, almost anything. Pasta is so versatile and super cheap to make from scratch, experimenting with flavors is the best practice to becoming a great pasta maker. 

* Preparation:

1. In a large mixing bowl, salt and any dry optional ingredients. Mix thoroughly and evenly, and form a well in the middle.

2. In another small mixing bowl, oil and any moist or liquid optional ingredients. Beat until frothy and well combined.

3. Pour egg mix into well of flour mix. Fold mixture until combined and start adding the other half cup of semolina until a stiff dough forms. 

4. Knead for five to ten minutes. Let rest for twenty.

5. If using a pasta machine

6. Cut the pasta in your favorite style and hang it to dry while you work on the rest of the dough. Hang on string
