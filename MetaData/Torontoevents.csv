Based on feedback we've split the meetup into two parts. As with most other meetups feel free to come and go as you please. If we have anything in particular scheduled (e.g. group photos) we can discuss the timing of those below. Same goes for any questions/comments/angry rants.

Location will depend on where free space is available, but we'll be bringing signs. I'll also update our location in this post the day off, and can provide my cell number to those concerned about finding us.

This is a chance for people of all ages to get their park on. Bring frisbees, dogs, slacklines, board games, picnic baskets, what have you. If you have any particular outdoor activities you'd like to partake of feel free to post them!

In a previous thread addressing the issue

Here are some of my ideas:

Tags are a must I think. It makes for easier filtering, [R4R] for more personal/intimate get togethers (platonic or romantic). I'm sure there are a few more that could be used, but I also suggest keeping it simple. 

A mega thread with info about moving to Toronto! It can be really confusing to move to a new city

A mega thread of regular /r/TorontoSocial users? This might be a tad ambitious, or say what part of town you're from could help. I would suggest any replies that are not in the specific format, or are just conversational in nature be removed to keep it neat, no children replies. I didn't say they were all good ideas.

An integrated calendar of properly scheduled events. I think I stole this idea from Dobs, including reservations, research, and spreading the word before it even makes it here. So officially recognized events on a calendar would be fantastic.

I have several reasons for this post, feel free to skip this one. At the meetups, everybody is stoned. People might not hear me, might not be listening, or even might be too far gone to care. Additionally, this topic is pretty personal, and I fear I would open myself to even more problematic remarks if I brought this up in person. Also, at the meetups I'm stoned as well

My main point is this: the amount of rape jokes at these meetups is too damn high. I am a victim of sexual assault, it is a reminder of the worst experience in my life. I do not choose to be offended, it affects me at a gut level. I would imagine I'm not alone, either. It's a reality that many women, as well as men, are victims of rape and other forms of sexual assault. A common sentiment is that we'd like to see more women at the meetups, but if we don't make this a woman-friendly space

I'm not trying to police you, but that also includes me, and possibly others who may be too timid to speak up. I'm just asking you all, ent to ent, person to person, friend to friend - let's be good to each other, just because we can. 

I don't want to stop attending the meetups, and people seem to enjoy my contributions, but if this continues, I don't think I would be able to handle it.

This upcoming Saturday marks the perfect chance to ring in the new year oppan Reddit style. And if your New Year's resolution is anything like mine (to party more) then you've found the right place. 


So go ahead, stand up eight. Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another. The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. Courage is the power to let go of the familiar. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. My Mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can move on. [Magic legs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKFKRuWwgjg).


For anyone that's never been to one of these before, pool, darts and a varied crowd of mostly happy Redditors. 


Joining a room of internet strangers may seem like a daunting undertaking for some

A request was made. It was for a ""Silly Hats Only"" meetup. Looking back

So

But before I go any further

I remember watching Don Hertzfeldt's Rejected many many years ago. The thunderous laughter that poured out from me was pure and unfiltered. I was amused to put things bluntly. Yes

There was that scene

Fast forward a few years and I was out on the back porch with my thoughts before realizing the neighbours were having a Silly Hats Party. They were older than me. Somewhere in their thirties and I thought

Let's pass through time some more to the moment I decide on having my own Silly Hats Only Party. It was fun. The place I was living in at the time's kitchen was being renovated but the party was a success nonetheless. I wore a cheap plastic viking hat I bought during my visit to Iceland not long before. Though

There you go. Silly hat parties aren't exclusively for people in their thirties. My initial thought was flawed. But that's okay

Now here I am

In any case

**If you've never been to a Reddit Monthly Meetup before. We meet on the second floor of the Artful Dodger and take our time to enjoy drinks, darts and each other in a less awkward way than you might imagine. There are many regulars and many new attendees every month.**

**It's all a lot of fun and whether you're new to the city or born and raised here

For a long while, an Arrested Development trivia night. That's why I'm bringing it up here first, to see if there's any interest and refine the idea a little before I make any concrete plans.

How the evening would work...

1) When attendees first arrive

2) Every 10 - 20 minutes or so, embarrassing feats of strength) to win points for their entire group and/or some personal prize.

3) In the background

4) Just after midnight

I've always been excited about this idea because I love dance parties, party version of the Hogwarts House Cup (""10 points to Gryffindor!)

Anyways, I can ensure you that if I decide to go ahead with this idea, I *will* make it happen.

""Thanks for inviting us over celticeric. Quick question

""That sounds great! We should have one every month!"" Benjp2k1 eagerly responded. Awkward murmurs followed.

""This is going to be a blast! What if we want to meetup for additional things though?"" Dobs spoke up with his familiar candor. 

""Good question

""I can help! Smiley face."" YellowPoison jumped in.

""I'll set up a Facebook group to pull in the cool cats!"" Scx_tyler followed.

""And I'll get something going for us TorEnts

""Can someone pass the salt?"" I spoke.

At this point everyone ate some turkey; and it was good.

This month

This is important for a number of reasons. I will detail one here. Ok, it would have been more difficult to do so without access to an automobile. That might be a bit abstract for some. A real world example has Sally Broome (fake name used due to privacy concerns) wanting to go from Jane St. to Wardan Ave prior to this date. Again, It would be more difficult to do so without a subway. 

So yeah, good people and good times! We'll be up the stairs on the second floor of the Artful Dodger. There are darts, a pool table and television screens. There is a table with a lot of table friends and a floor to stand on so we don't fall back down through to the first. Studies show that 83% of all attendees have more fun on meetup nights than they do on non-meetup nights. Fact.

&gt;We're meeting up

&gt;For anyone that hasn't been to one of these before

&gt;We're up on the second floor and have the whole thing booked. Pool table, drinks. It's all there.

&gt;This won't go down in history as my most creative invite. But August is the practical month. So at least this post is practical. That's not actually the word I was looking to use...

**WHO:** You


The monthly meetup consists of people drinking (or not) and socializing (or not). It's lots of fun! This will be my anniversary of coming to Reddit monthly meetups, and as long as you're happy to meet new people no one will care about your age. Yes, girls show up. No, no one will ask you that narwhal bacon question. Yes, we have regulars (because Toronto Reddit meetups are awesome), but we also get tons of new people. You will find us by going up the stairs at the Artful Dodger and asking the first person you see if this is the Reddit meetup. What if you're awkward? Feel free to send me a message and I will be your friend and introduce you to new people. We're a very friendly group!

It was four years ago this month that Reddit user Annexchick [started a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/9537g/lets_try_it_again_torontogta_meetup_august_8ish/) in the then relatively new /r/toronto with the line: 


*""Let's try it again - Toronto/GTA Meetup


There was discussion about where and when to meet and Dobs, and for several more to follow. 



In time, located in the city's west end took place. There were periods when we were provided our own security and dedicated serving staff but our settlement was not complete until a more central location was decided on.



The Artful Dodger was selected and remains where the /r/toronto community gathers to this day. Whether through the large contingent of committed regulars or one-time attendees, to make that nervous first trip.



Over the years



Still going strong with no sign of letting up

Unless there's a large vote against it, so we need a staging area for the first half hour while people show up.  The location we chose last time was less than ideal.  It would be great if some of you can volunteer some time to show up early with me to scope out a nice spot

* A ball or two

* A guitar or tam tam drum if you want to make some music

Vice Executive Director

Fundraising Director
Curatorial Director

And the following assistants:
Assistant Financial Director
Assistant Activities Director
Assistant Communications and Marketing Director
Assistant Community Engagement Director
Assistant Curatorial Director
Assistant Fundraising Director
Assistant Special Projects Director
Assistant Technology Director

Basic duties are meetings once a week over skype or in person (roughly an hour each week, and helping out with other duties.

All positions are volunteer and unpaid (even the executive director!). Position starts immediately upon ‘hiring’ and will last to when the festival ends (unless you love us so much you decide to stay on for TUPF15). Right now a lot of these positions are self-directed (hence being the director!), it shouldn’t take up much more than a few hours a week depending on your title and dedication. More will be requested incremently as we near the actual festival.

The festival for 2014 is tentatively scheduled for 27 June to 12 July (depending on availability of gallery/workshop space and other planning things). 

If you’re interested in helping out for any of the positions, your interests, and what positions you would like to apply for. We will get back you as soon as we can.

Pacific Rim is Guillermo del Toro's latest film

&gt; When legions of monstrous creatures, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes-a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)-who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse. (c) Warner Bros

Here are the details:

* **WHEN:** Sunday, well.. stuff happens.

* **WHERE:** High Park

* **HOW TO FIND US:** After leaving Keele station, go in, and in just a few paces you should see a dirt path on your left that leads into the trees.  Follow it.  You'll come to a clearing, where we will find a spot to set up.  Not sure about the exact location within this clearing yet but will post on the day of where we are for people who arrive late.  I will also bring some sort of landmark item to set up by the group so people can spot us.

* **WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, blankets for sitting on, frisbees, dodgeballs, dogs, etc.  I live close enough that I will attempt to bring a cooler with some drinks as well.  

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Come anyway.  We share.  We're awesome like that. :D

* **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A relaxing afternoon the park with chill, definitely some good conversation.  I might bring Werewolf with me - if you haven't played, you'll enjoy it.

What to bring (Beyond the obvious)

* Frisbees (duh)

* A ball or two

* A guitar or tam tam drum if you want to make some music

* Some snackage or beverages if you want to munch on stuff

Despite the fact that 4/20 falls on a Saturday this year, but I'm crossing my fingers that May will be warm enough to get back out to Trinity Bellwoods, because this winter has been going on far too long.

*UPDATE*: So it turns out that PerplexD of /r/TOTrees is planning some [shenanigans for 4/20 proper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOtrees/comments/1cex95/totrees_420_meet_up/)  We will still have our monthly meetup as originally scheduled though.

* **WHERE**: Vapor Central - 667 Yonge St. (Just south of Charles

* **WHEN**: April 21st

* **HOW TO FIND US**: First and foremost, and I will try to have some sort of Reddit-related sign on display as well. I will also update this thread once we have situated permanently with our location.

* **WHAT TO BRING**: Trees, toys, games - whatever you'd like.

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY**: *UPDATE -*It has come to my attention that Vapor Central has a no sharing policy that I was previously unaware of.  I'm not going to change the venue for this month

* **WHAT TO EXPECT**: Fun people in a relaxing environment. Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.

The book was released in 2007 and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for non-fiction, but chooses to explore the major historical, philosophical and political turmoils of the 20th century, refracted through the classical and popular music of the time. 

While I'm sure the the Southbank Centre's festival will be a significant event for the ever growing appreciation of modern classical music, for a book/listening club. If there's enough interest I wouldn't mind taking on the task of collecting various musical playlists for listening/discussion, as well as organizing music performance outings, since many local institutions (The Royal Conservatory, Canadian Opera Company, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, etc) are performing various works that Ross discusses.


Anyway, perhaps this would be an opportunity to explore some music which you wouldn't traditionally associate with ""classical music"".

Here are some various YouTube clips of various composers/compositions that Ross discusses (and which will also be performed in some manner in Toronto) this year: [Strauss' Salome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNI9EbZu2gs);
[Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMifv1ntm8E); [Britten's The Turn of the Screw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbE3uML3oI); [Arvo Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc); [Poulenc's Dialogue of the Carmelites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUXp-fpiD0).

It also gives me the opportunity to make a few changes in how we organize these get-togethers in the hopes of bringing in some new faces

Last year, as well as some confusion over certain details (such as how to track us down, is it okay to come if you're dry, what to expect, and the like).  I am hoping that we can remedy this for 2013.

For all of the old regulars, new faces are always more than welcome and encouraged.  Also, if you have any suggestions/improvements you'd like to see, or complaints about previous meetups you'd like to address, don't hesitate to voice your opinions loudly.

**HOW TO FIND US:** First and foremost, and I will try to have some sort of Reddit-related sign on display as well.  I will also update this thread once we have situated permanently with our location.

**WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, toys, games - whatever you'd like.  I would really love to try Cards Against Humanity if anyone has a deck.

**WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Don't let that stop you from attending.  We love meeting new people regardless and we're always happy to share with fellow ents.

**WHAT TO EXPECT:** Fun people in a relaxing environment.  Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.

Soon, Portia finds herself bending the rules for Jeremiah, putting at risk the life she thought she always wanted -- but in the process finding her way to a surprising and exhilarating life and romance she never dreamed of having.

The buy in will be $15 per person ($75 per team) and it will be a double elimination format and capped out at 6 teams.

**Rules:**

The tournament will be in a Captain’s Mode and using the hero pool that is currently available in Captain’s mode (No Centaur Warrunner, Tuskar and Slark).

Teams will flip a coin and the victor will decide what side they want (Radiant = First pick/Ban). 
Admins will come over in the case of a dispute and settle any issues should they arise. 

**Prizes:**

1st : $300

2nd: 1 10 hour Time Package to Net Effect.


The tournament will begin promptly at 11 A.M Saturday April 13th. 
If we see a growing interest in the Toronto scene for Dota 2 related events we will host much bigger tournaments and open up prepayment to this event.

Man, so let's give it a shot.  
   
I'll be waiting at the ticket machines downstairs at the Scotiabank at 7.10pm

The movie sounds interesting
&gt;Once a successful New York couple, is referred to respected psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Banks who offers the latest in prescription drugs to try and alleviate her anxiety. However as Emily's relationship with both Dr Banks and her prescribed medication intensifies, she finds herself descending into a chemical-fuelled nightmare where the lines between fantasy and reality become dangerously blurred. This is a riveting psychological thriller where neither the symptoms nor the cure are quite as straightforward as they seem.

It's not anywhere near as depressing as my last choice

Warm Bodies is a romantic comedy first and foremost, description:

&gt; A funny twist on a classic love story, and rescues her from a zombie attack. Julie sees that R is different from the other zombies, and as the two form a special relationship in their struggle for survival, R becomes increasingly more human - setting off an exciting, romantic, and often comical chain of events that begins to transform the other zombies and maybe even the whole lifeless world.

Description:

But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, a CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist named Tony Mendez comes up with a risky plan to get them safely out of the country.

Hey guys!

Ho-ho-ho! It's ***STORYTIME!!!*** Gather around children!

***In a little town called Toronto - the capital of Canada (sorry Ottawa - Mayor Ford said so)***

One day, Timmy said to himself,

&gt;*This year's been so busy
&gt;
&gt;*Nevertheless
&gt;
&gt;*I know! I'll get something to eat!*
&gt;
&gt;*But where oh where should I go?*
&gt;
&gt;*Where the friends are abundant and where beer must flow!*
&gt;
&gt;*But where can I find this magical place?*
&gt;
&gt;*Surely SOMEONE is on the case!""*
&gt; ***
&gt; ***-Little Timmy (1984 - 2014)***

Children! Can you help Timmy find a place where he can find food AND friends? Why don't we tell Timmy about this upcoming Potluck!

&gt;*Timmy
&gt;
&gt;*For now is a joyous time of year.*
&gt;
&gt;*Beer
&gt;
&gt;*With games to play - including Settlers and Charades!*
&gt;
&gt;*Taragine's Epic Christmas Potluck is the place to be*
&gt;
&gt;*Heck - it's even located near the TTC!*

So Little Timmy marked his calendar for the 22^nd of December - it was coming soon after all - just in a week's time! But he still had some questions...

&gt;*""Gee thanks
&gt;
&gt;*Without you I would have been bored instead!*
&gt;
&gt;*But what should I bring
&gt;
&gt;*For this event that is supposed to be a joyous occasion!""*

**What should Little Timmy bring?** I know kids

* **Option 1** - ""I'm going to contribute in cooking! I'll be bringing seasonal food for three!"" (like a big ass bowl full of salad or squash - note pop and chips are already covered, feel free to).
* **Option 2** - ""Every time I cook

As for **RSVPing, as there are ***LIMITED SPACES***!

&gt;*Well I've made up my mind
&gt;
&gt;*I'll be going! All my ducks are aligned!*
&gt;
&gt;*I let Taragine know what I'm bringing
&gt;
&gt;*and of course

Tomorrow night a bunch of us will be heading out to see [Upstream Color](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/) at the [TIFF Bell Lightbox](https://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=TIFF+Bell+Lightbox&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=TIFF+Bell+Lightbox&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,0,5721766538735862166&amp;ei=_3N1UdrQC4_3rAHyh4GADQ&amp;ved=0CMYBEPwSMAE).

Upstream Color is the second movie by Shane Carruth

[Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=b1TQikxxt94)

&gt; Kris is derailed from her life when she is drugged by a small-time thief. But something bigger is going on. She is unknowingly drawn into the life cycle of a presence that permeates the microscopic world, livestock, and back again. Along the way, she finds another being-a familiar, who is equally consumed by the larger force. The two search urgently for a place of safety within each other as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of their wrecked lives.

As always we'll go out *after* for dinner drinks nearby

It's Tuesday which means I'm late posting this but also movie time!  If you need to know more about The Place Beyond the Pines than Ryan Gosling

&gt;Luke (Ryan Gosling) is in constant motion, Romina (Eva Mendes), only to learn that she has in his absence given birth to their son Jason. Luke resolves to forsake life on the road and to provide for his newfound family, taking a job as car mechanic with Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). Robin soon discovers Luke's special talents, and proposes to partner with him in a string of spectacular bank robberies. But it is only a matter of time before Luke will run up against the law -- which comes in the form of Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper).

I'll be by the far ticket machines at 6.30pm

My finger is bleeding and at the bus stop there was some guy complaining about being left at the club by his homeys. It was fucking hilarious. I LOL'd to the max. And now I am home.

Thanks for awesome meetup y'all. To all those who missed out

Y'all and LOL!

Update: I remember the Vapor Lounge was kind of quiet because everybody was stoned. Two girls showed up and left for Harry Potter (how was that?) and Emad showed up late and disappeared after five seconds. The two other Redditors I chilled with initially also disappeared.

Group got more chatty at the Korean place cuz we were all stoned and it was lol AND THERE WAS FOODSTUFFS FROM THE GODS. I split water on myself but could not give a fuck.

We went to a place and another place but I did not know where we were going. Then we all chilled at some bar and had awesomepants time full of awesomepants. 

Left at 1:14 AM to go to St George subway but their shit was all retarded (coin machine didn't work) but some lady gave me her pass for the Bernard subway and SUCCESS!

Went west then south by accident, waited for last 2:48 bus with two people wearing headphones (one guy was eating a hit dog. BOMB!) and the aforementioned complainer on phone dude.

Got to my street at 3:10 (successful Pee Journey into random bush), finshed listening to Who album I was on (LOVVE DUN DUN DUN REIGN ORRR MEEE) and went to sleep. Now I am here.

Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them.

We'll be presenting Death Bed: The Bed That Eats - a ridiculously awful piece of late 70s cinematic trash that's about a demon-possessed bed with a hunger for human flesh (though you may have been able to figure that out due to the hilariously blunt title).

We've booked the 3rd floor of the Office Pub (117 John St.) down in the entertainment district. There's a projector/screen setup on that floor, it's more or less ideal to have a casual environment where everyone can chill on couches, get a little drunk, and shout at the screen when bad dialogue or a special effects failure happens.

PRESS RELEASE (MAY
International Human Rights Organizations and Dear Friends

This is an urgent call from human rights defenders, professional chambers, grassroots, neighborhood associations and Istanbulites.

Since the 27th of May, soon to be demolished due to a so-called renewal project. This Project foresees the erection of a big mall (designed as the replica of the once Ottoman Artillery Barracks) in the place of those trees.

The police intervened in the park 3 times

The first intervention was in the morning of May 28th

In solidarity with the protestors, causing serious injuries.

Against this inhumanity and extreme violence

At the moment, having taken refuge there from the effect of the gas attacks.
Literally, is tear-gassed and
pepper gas-sprayed; especially the side streets around Taksim Square are under clouds of gas.

And this morning proved to be the culmination of violence and barbarism that no words can describe, nearly getting choked to death. The only way out was by breaking the walls and many were wounded during this escape.

The resistance for democracy and human rights will not be terminated; we are determined to continue our struggle against a government determined to crush each and every opposition

The present Turkish government has violated all international human rights conventions and mechanisms it is a party to.

Simultaneous protests are taking place in different cities of Turkey at the moment and we have been informed of other protests in London

Your valuable support and solidarity will indeed fortify our determination and resistance.

* Time: October 15th @ 5pm


* Cost: $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage (provided any are available). Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.
 

* Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com

The movie came out just this past week

Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's latest movie, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley. The movie hasn't received quite the critical acclaim of District 9, but if the trailer's any indication it's retained a lot of the same style. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=TlW0I8MniSM), description:

&gt; In the year 2154, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance to bring equality to these worlds is Max, an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, but millions of people on Earth as well.

1375898864.0,1jwckt,[AUG 11] /r/Trees Mini Meetup - High Park - 3pm,kobrakae,12,5,17,"(Reposted with correct date)

So two weekends ago, I'm organizing a follow-up.  I realize this falls on the same weekend as the main Reddit meetup and that we've gotten our meetup times all skewed, so if you can't come out that's totally cool - but if anyone wants to come chill with me feel free!

Here are the details:

* **WHEN:** Sunday

* **WHERE:** High Park

* **HOW TO FIND US:** After leaving Keele station, go in, and in just a few paces you should see a dirt path on your left that leads into the trees.  Follow it.  You'll come to a clearing, where we will find a spot to set up.  Not sure about the exact location within this clearing yet but will post on the day of where we are for people who arrive late.  I will also bring some sort of landmark item to set up by the group so people can spot us.

* **WHAT TO BRING:** Trees, blankets for sitting on, frisbees, dodgeballs, dogs, etc.  I live close enough that I will attempt to bring a cooler with some drinks as well.  

* **WHAT IF I'M DRY:** Come anyway.  We share.  We're awesome like that. :D

* **WHAT TO EXPECT:** A relaxing afternoon the park with chill, definitely some good conversation.  I might bring Werewolf with me - if you haven't played, you'll enjoy it.

This Tuesday a few of us will be heading out to see [Compliance](http://www.google.ca/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Toronto&amp;ei=ORwpUKnONKT5ygHX24HQBw&amp;mid=eaf9052c5a5eba58&amp;date=1) at the [TIFF Bell Lightbox](https://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=tiff+bell+lightbox&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=tiff+bell+lightbox&amp;hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,0,5721766538735862166&amp;ei=334pUJ7ZEMfRyQHYmoD4BA&amp;ved=0CL4BEPwSMAA). Because this is a slightly later showing than usual, we'll do dinner starting **6:30 pm at [The Office Pub](http://www.theofficepub.ca/)** and head to the theatre around 8 pm.

**Please post to RSVP as soon as possible so we know how much restaurant space we'll need!**

What's Compliance? It's based on a [series of prank calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_prank_call_scam) in the US where a mystery caller pretending to be a detective would coerce managers into strip-searching their coworkers. These stories became a bit of an urban legend and matter of online interest back during the height of Fark and Digg. [Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6YA0KVmLoI&amp;feature=player_embedded)

&gt; Becky and Sandra aren't the best of friends. Sandra is a middle-aged manager at a fast-food restaurant; Becky is a teenaged counter girl who really needs the job. One stressful day (too many customers and too little bacon), which she vehemently denies. Sandra, overwhelmed by her managerial responsibilities, complies with the officer's orders to detain Becky. This choice begins a nightmare that tragically blurs the lines between expedience and prudence, legality and reason.

What's Bernie? Jack Black playing a gold digging assistant funeral directory

&gt; Assistant funeral director Bernie Tiede was one of the town's most beloved residents. He taught Sunday school, an affluent widow who was as well known for her sour attitude as her fortune. He frequently traveled with Marjorie and even managed her banking affairs. She became fully dependant on Bernie and his generosity, and he struggled to meet her increasing demands. He continued to handle her affairs, and the townspeople went months without seeing her. They were shocked when it was reported that she had been dead for some time, and Bernie was being charged with the murder.

WHAT IF I'M DRY: Don't let that stop you from attending. We love meeting new people regardless and we're always happy to share with fellow ents.


WHAT TO EXPECT: Fun people in a relaxing environment. Vapor Central usually has entertaining stuff playing on the TVs, we joke around, we play a game here or there, and sometimes we head out for a bite afterwards.

The idea of the mission is simple:

We ask you to either make gifts or buy some affordable presents. Spend whatever you think is reasonable ($1 items are fine!), and bringing that to life. Whether it is a some art you make, a yo-yo, candy canes, etc! Be creative, but make it personal! Then wrap each present individually!

Along with these gifts

Make as many gifts as you like. And keep track of what is in each one. So that you can hand it out to the right age/gender/type of person.

DETAILS:

When: 3pm

Where: Meeting at Nathan Phillips Square

[Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=LwHjqDIEQqs)

&gt; One of the most highly anticipated films of the year, immersive documentary that takes you deep inside the dangerous world of commercial fishing. Set aboard a hulking fishing vessel as it navigates the treacherous waves off the New England coast-the very waters that once inspired Moby Dick- the film captures the harsh, unforgiving world of the fishermen in starkly haunting, yet beautiful detail. Employing an arsenal of cameras that pass freely from film crew to ship crew, and swoop from below sea level to astonishing bird's-eye views, LEVIATHAN is unlike anything you have ever seen; a purely visceral, cinematic experience.

Unleashed on the Earth for the first time in centuries, Jack, into the battle of his life to stop them. Fighting for a kingdom, its people, and the love of a brave princess, he comes face to face with the unstoppable warriors he thought only existed in legend-and gets the chance to become a legend himself.

Right now I have my eye primarily on [TIFF's Bond retrospective](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2013/2440002191) and am planning to go see *Casino Royale* on Saturday at 2:45PM.  
I'm also interested in [*Laura*](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/2330009467) and half the films in TIFF's [Countdown to Armageddon](http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/2440001198). Nothing better than spending your last week on Earth watching films at the Lightbox if you're a film lover like me
I know these are all the Lightbox

There's just a few things you should know about how unfun I might be to hang out with:

* I don't drink (usually) or smoke (anything).
* I am an introvert and a private person. (I still talk though. Sometimes. Maybe.)
* I'm bad with schedules.
* I don't own a cell phone

Hopefully there's enough interest in this sort of thing so that it becomes a large enough group and the above won't matter. Now that I've sold myself on not being fun to hang out with

PM me for contact information if interested!

Next meetup bring either a blank colored shirt or even one with a simple design (Stripes?!) It can be brand new or you can revitalize an old favourite.

Next meetup I will bring a few stencil designs (And I'll post them here) and you guys can pick and choose what kind of Ent shirt you want. Then I can put the design on your shirt with bleach and give them back to you at the next meetup!

(check out http://www.reddit.com/r/bleachshirts For an example)

You can also do this yourself. So tell me what you think of the idea and I'll update this post tomorrow with some stencil ideas. Feel free to print them out and use them yourself.

I'm in a really fun show tomorrow night at comedy bar called 'Teh Internets Quiz Show'. It's a panel show similar to Qi but about memes and internet culture. I've seen this show before and loved it and now I'm fortunate enough to play it!

god made me funky is a great rock band that does a lot of dance songs.  Set 2 (around 9pm is their best).  This band could be playing stadiums

Phusion has a really nice sound.  Play a lot of 80s covers.  A few blocks east.  This is another band where their whole set is a good party.

In between

Dr. Draw (near woodbine) is super high energy violin rock.

Juice (kinda playing far away east) have a lounge/jamiroquai feel

This is toronto's best event of the year and its free.  Its best in very small groups though

**Attention Toronto Fashionista's and DIYers of Reddit**

Her website is www.designherco.com

The address of the studio is 1380 Bathurst Street 

There is limited free parking half a block north on the east side of the street. Of course

Here's a little invite I wrote just for Reddit:

This weekend will see the opening of a ""Craft Studio for the Crafty Fashionista"" on Bathurst St. just south of St.Clair. DesignHerCo studios will be hosting an open house this Saturday April 14th and Sunday April 15th for guests to sample free craft classes and explore the chic new space.


What I find truly incredible about this launch is not just the outstanding concept that is DesignHerCo, female entrepreneur. In a world where women are still not paid on par and where entrepreneurship too often takes a back seat to the safety of a desk job, Dara (my GF) has created the possibility of her own big, beautiful success through inspiring creativity in others.

GURPS is the gaming system I'd like to use, but not exclusively high fantasy. You can really make any sort of character you want, which I'd be happy to help with. It's a really great system for games, it's simple, really inclusive of all genres, you don't need to purchase a set of special dice or anything, and it allows for endless creativity. I can also provide all the books as pdfs and have extra dice to go around.

The GM (game master) is the person who runs the game, moves along the plot, etc etc. Simply put, the storyteller.

Same basic schedule as last month - we will start the event at 5pm. This should give us time to build up an appetite for KBBQ or other munchies later on in the night - probably around 8pm.

**Venue:** Vapor Central. If they are unexpectedly closed on the day of the meetup

**Time:** January 22 @ 5pm

**Cost:** $5 membership fee for the day. That gets you in the door and provides unlimited vaporizer usage. Bongs can be rented for as little as $5 for the basics to $15 or 20 for something fancy like a Roor.
Exact location is 667 Yonge Street. 2 blocks south of Bloor on the east side. More info on the place at their website: http://www.vaporcentral.com/Welcome.html

So, especially with all the older movies at the Scotiabank.  I looked, and none were on at a reasonable time for Tuesday so instead, let's go see Amour at the Varsity cinema at 7.05pm.  

Description:
&gt;Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers in their 80s, seemingly frozen in time. In a few minutes she snaps out of it. She doesn't want to bother seeing a doctor, but Georges insists.

&gt;Anne has suffered a stroke

&gt;Thus begins Anne's downward spiral

Sounds super depressing but we should never shy away from a movie just because it might be a bit of a downer.  It has excellent reviews.

I talked a good talk about the movie meetups for those I met at the global, walk the walk?  I don't know, something like that.  We saw the trailer for [Seeking a Friend for the End of the World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307068/) at a recent movie night and the consensus was positive so let's give it a shot.  The [Carlton theatre](http://www.google.ca/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Toronto&amp;ei=2s3oT833BOG46QHBk4HhDg&amp;tid=36f834448fef0bd9&amp;view=map) is showing it at 7.15pm and I'll be waiting outside at 6.45pm.  We'll head in just before 7 as we need to get seats so if you're there past 7, head on in.
