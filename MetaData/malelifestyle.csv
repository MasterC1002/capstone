SECTION I: BARE MINIMUM FOR TOUGHING IT.

This section is about your actual movement through country - the second is more the niceties I like when I know I'm not getting shot at, whatever.

Boots for Toughing it:

First, but let me give you some general advice on buying and wearing them:

* If you're moving out for long periods of time under weight, the better.

* If you buy gore-tex boots for anything other than snowy conditions, and even if you're moving through streams and creeks, your body heat will dry your boots out in a matter of miles. Change socks, when you get wet or too sweaty, use wool ones or wool blends. You want those wheels to breathe!

* I like Darn Tough brand socks; keep a few spare pairs in an accessible spot on your pack, and moleskine. If you get a hotspot, don't wait till it turns into a blister. Make use of medicated foot powder. Take them off and dry your feet out whenever you get a chance. If you're really going to be moving out, read [Fixing Your Feet](http://www.amazon.com/Fixing-Your-Feet-Prevention-Treatments/dp/0899976387) - worth every penny. Even if you're going to Manhattan for a week, you should have this book.

* Get ones with a higher stovepipe if you're going to be under weight, or a fat wad of 550 cord.

In case you can't tell, but the gist is toughen up by doing what you're gonna be doing with the weight you're gonna be doing it with in the gear you're going to be doing it in.

Misc Tools for Toughing it

* A good knife has saved my ass more than once. I like [ESEE Knives](http://www.eseeknives.com), and the throats of marauders.
* A multitool
* A half dozen carabiners of various sizes - the little tiny ones come in handy more often than not. You can clip shit to your bag that won't fit
* A G-shock watch
* Water carrying container - Nalgene or similar. Wide mouth makes it easier to eat soup or spoon shit into.
* Headlamp - think about batteries. My Petzl has been through something like three years of deployments and a few times through the washing machine
* Small but beefy combination lock.
* One of those microfiber towels that roll up tight and dry fast
* Flipflops for airing your feet out. If you get some classy ones
* Gorilla Tape (100mph tape) good for damn near everything. I pull off about 10 feet and then roll it into a flat
* Gorilla Glue and super glue. Good for fixing shit and closing wounds
* Small first aid kit
* Bungees for lashing things down come in handy

Bags for Toughing it

* Get something with an internal frame. 
* Don't be one of those slick faggots that buys something that looks cool, beefy plastic buckles (and spares) and a few external pockets. 
* I squish all my shit into heavy-duty zip-lock bags
* Make sure everything is adjustable and don't buy anything until you've put it under load. REI is great for this sort of things

""Sleeping bag"" for toughing it

I don't use one. I have an [ENO](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com) hammock (get the double-wide and buy their straps, the blanket and the woobie are enough to keep the rest warm. You can get some ultralight sleeping bags that compress down pretty well, but I've found for most moderate climates those items are the best as they take up little space.

Clothing for Toughing It

* For cold weather, outer layer of cotton/poly blend or gore-tex. 
* Avoid thick cotton and denim. Jeans are okay in the desert.
* Overall you want to be as lightweight as possible and stay away from pure cotton

If you're moving out like you should be

(And let me rant for a minute here. Unless you're going to a desert that actually has dust storms, wait until its cold and then go buy a proper knit one, jeez. Those things are for keeping the mucky dustrain that comes about in a legitimate sandstorm you massive tools. I keep a faded bandana to wet and tuck under my cap in the heat, otherwise, just have lots of socks and tshirts. Socks. Good ones.)

When I travel to the desert regions, or any of the synthetic stuff they have at REI is great and affordable too. Try and get subdued colors so you don't look like a flashy asshole. Avoid logos and stuff that gives away your nationality - your'e trying to blend in and learn about the culture, not parade about.


SECTION II: COMFORT ITEMS

* I bring a pipe and tobacco for myself. For everyone else, you can get everything else you need.
* Caffeine pills
* Caswell Massey cologne &amp; soap. 
* A solid dopp kit bag - if you can
* Kindle with lots of books, but I wouldn't recommend a laptop - too many distractions! If your'e bored, start walking and meeting people, you'll learn more and make some lifelong friends, not like these reddit scoundrels telling you what to pack and how to dress ;)
* A safety razor with blades
* Clarks desert boots are classy
* Sunglasses. You want something that covers up your eyes fairly well to prevent dust. I know those aviators look cool
* Inflatable pillow is nice to have!
* No gentleman travels without a deck of cards and some condoms
* An [Opinel No 10](http://www.amazon.com/Opinel-Knives-Corkscrew-Knife-Handles/dp/B001BEL9U4) has gotten me laid a couple times
* [Dalvey Flask](http://www.dalvey.com/shop-online/compasses-outdoor/dalvey-flask-cup/stainless-steel-detail)
* A freakin notebook and pencils

Some other adventure tips:

* Photocopy your documents/passport and email them to yourself

* Call your bank ahead of time and let them know your'e traveling so they don't lock your card up for weird activity

* Password protect and log out/clean of all your shit before you move out - in some countries, and photos are verboten - just keep your shit buried, man

* Call your local travel clinic and make sure you've got all your shots

* Learn a few basic greetings and/or write them down for yourself. Most people will be happy you're at least making an effort


There's a lot of little comfort items and kit that I'm sure you all are happy to recommend/add to this list, man.

By Henry Rollins",13,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/mztbo/the_iron_by_henry_rollins/,"I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.

Completely.

When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, wondering why.

I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.

I hated myself all the time.


As stupid at it seems now, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn’t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you’ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time. I didn’t think much of them either.

Then came Mr. Pepperman, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.

He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred-pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, but I couldn’t even drag them to my mom’s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.

Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.’s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn’t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn’t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.

Weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.

Right before Christmas break I was walking to class

It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble. That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking

I used to fight the pain

I have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone’s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr.Pepperman.

Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.

Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion

Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt

I prefer to work out alone.

It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you’re made of is always time well spent

I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly

Through the years, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.

The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.",,False,self,t5_2sk0u,False,,

Basically brothers. He's one of my best friends.


He just asked his long term girlfriend (6 years now) to marry him


r/malelifestyle - what now? What should I be doing for them? What can I expect?


I am assuming that I am in the running for best man

I know the two of them intimately. He is like family

Some things I am considering.

For the engagement itself:

* Do I get them an engagement gift? What would be a good gift? Something small right? for the two of them too

* Do I take them out to a dinner to celebrate? We have a great place in our college's town that we frequented a lot - I was thinking of going there.

Stag Party

* Make sure he stays out of handcuffs.

* Make sure he has a blast.

* Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid or jeopardize his relationship in any way (not a problem)



Wedding

* Should I ask to be involved in the planning process? or help out at all?

* Price range on gifts? Again, so there is always that... but I feel like that's childish...


I'm literally stream of consciousness thoughts right now


Thanks for any/all input or advice guys.

I want to make the place look unique and comfortable (make it my own) but not spend much money on furniture

Some ideas I had already were to just buy a futon for my bed that can double as a couch if I'm entertaining. Buy a coffee table with pillows for asian themed eating if I'm entertaining. *I don't plan on entertaining much because I don't know anyone there yet* I'll need something for my clothes in addition to my closet. I'll probably buy plastic shelves?

Sure

Other thoughts to consider: I want to get into painting

A nice little TINY workout area might be nice to sit and stretch and bust out some pushups or whatever else. Maybe I'll buy a yoga mat for this?

Any input would be appreciated. I want to make this place unique and feel at home. It's very important to me because I am moving far away from my friends,,False,self,t5_2sk0u,False,,True

I wanted to share a really useful set of concepts related to this topic.

The most important element of any self-protection plan is awareness.  It doesn't matter what sorts of tools or training you have if you never saw the threat coming.

The system I'm about to introduce will help you and your loved ones avoid all manner of danger.  Not just muggings, and just about anything else.

Let's think about states of awareness for a second.  This will allow us to recognize our own state of awareness


I will list each state by its name

**Unaware**  (AKA:  Condition White)

Referred to by anatomists as craniorectal insertion

Once you know what to look for, et cetera.

If you've ever been out in public

The problem with condition white is

The only time you should be in condition white is inside your home

**Aware** (AKA:  Condition Yellow)

This is a state of relaxed awareness.  Not anxiety.  Not expecting ninjas to jump out at any moment.  Relaxed awareness.

If you're in condition yellow, and what they are doing.  You don't get surprised by people coming up and tapping you on the shoulder, because you glanced and saw them coming your way a few moments ago.  You are always looking for lanes of access and egress; emergency escapes, exits, ways to get out of the place you're in quickly.

You are not lost in thought or in an electronic device.  You are monitoring your surroundings and thinking about the world around you and what is happening.

Your mindset is

whether that's pulling them out of the way of a bus

If you're outside of your home

**Alert** (AKA: Condition Orange)

A specific potential threat has been identified.

""There's a bus coming

""That guy has been following me for three blocks

""I think I smell smoke in this restaurant.  Is the kitchen on fire?""

Now that you're aware of a specific threat,' or 'If he keeps following me, I'm going to turn and face him.'

Start thinking about how to use those lanes of egress you identified earlier and position yourself to get into them

You're not sure the threat is a danger yet

If you have protection tools (pepper spray, so you don't have to fumble for it.)

I will sometimes take evasive action at condition orange to confirm the threat.

For example, I might circle the block.  If the car is not following me, it will leave at some point.  If it isn't, it'll still be there (at which time I would drive to the police station).

**Alarm** (AKA:  Condition Red)

I don't mean that in condition red

Alarm means [a call to arms](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alarm#Noun)

The threat has been identified

The mugger is approaching with the rusty screwdriver.

The bus is bearing down on you.

The restaurant kitchen is on fire.

It's time to put that plan from back in condition orange into action; get out

---

I like to play games to keep my awareness sharp when out in public.  I try to make sure no one can sneak up on me.  I try to see how many different ways I can monitor my surroundings discreetly.  (It's always fun to open a door for someone walking behind you without ever having looked at them; reflections in glass doors and windows are fantastic).

I quiz myself of the people around me (how many people behind you are wearing hats?).  I people watch.  I mentally kick myself if I ever get caught in condition white

None of this is professional advice.  I'm not a lawyer or expert of any kind; if this information is useful to you,,False,self,t5_2sk0u,False,,True

1375252723.0,1jen9l,The recent post about not being able to handle whiskey inspired me to write a quick guide to entering the world of whiskey for those of you who don't know how.,theholidayhawk,29,3,9,"Most people believe that whiskey and other distilled spirits serve only one purpose. That purpose is to get a person drunk as quickly as possible. While this certainly is a viable use for whiskey it is not the only one. For many

The purpose of this guide is not to try and get you to stop drinking whiskey as you most enjoy it, and it is yours alone. In my opinion making your own decisions is what part of being a man and living the male lyfestyle is. If you only want to drink whiskey to get drunk, and not for the other qualities of the whiskey, stop reading here.

The first barrier that is in the way of a person enjoying whiskey is the harshness of the beverage. Some you will find to be very harsh, is to use water to reduce the alcohol content. This can help to release the aromas and flavors as well as cut the burn from the alcohol. Second, ice can be used; this both reduces the alcohol content and cools the whiskey. Both the reduction in percentage and the cooler temperature will help cut the burn, however the cooling will also act to reduce the flavor of the whiskey. Third, and possibly the best, is to use a whiskey nosing glass such as a glencairn or copita. These have a “tulip” shape and help to concentrate the aromas of the whiskey making it easier to smell, which is also a very important aspect tasting anything. Snifters can also be used for nosing whiskey

Sometimes the harshness can come from the flavor profile of the whiskey. Not much can be done about this other than ice and cooling the whiskey. However

Once you have dealt with the harshness of a whiskey you will finally be able to taste and nose the whiskey. Nosing should come first. It can help ease the drinker into the whiskey and can give a good idea of what to expect from tasting it. Smell is also an important aspect of taste

The technique for nosing is fairly simple. Swirling the whiskey in the glass will help increase surface area of the whiskey and release more of the particles that create the aroma. Then

When tasting it is often best to start with a relatively small amount of whiskey and move it around your mouth

I will also include a short list of some of the most highly suggested beginner whiskey brands for those people who have never heard of any other than Jack Daniels, but they are the ones that most beginners tend to enjoy and they aren’t very expensive. There are many types of whiskey out there, all of which have their own unique flavors. The only way to find out what you like is to try them.

Bourbons: Makers Mark, Four Roses, Evan Williams (Comes in Black Label and Single Barrel), Old Grand-Dad (Comes in 80 proof, 100 proof, and 114 proof), Bulleit.

American Rye: Bulliet Rye, Russell's Reserve Rye.

Irish: Jameson (Comes in several types)

Scotch: Highland Park 12, Macallan.

If you have further interest in learning about whiskey /r/bourbon, and /r/worldwhisky are all great resources for find new and exciting whiskeys as well as learning about the processes of making different whiskeys.",,False,self,t5_2sk0u,1375285877.0,,
