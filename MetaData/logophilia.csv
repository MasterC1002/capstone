The English usage of the Latin word for -

* as; in the capacity or character of

* in so far as

-is quite varied and fills a couple of very useful roles when talking about a thing which may be thought of in multiple respects.

**(All following information from ShreevatsaR's response on [this page](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/8970/how-is-the-word-qua-used) which I have pasted below)**

Qua can usually be read as the word ""as"".

It is an occasionally useful (and rarely used) link-word in English. I was just reading about qua in Fowler's (incl. the 3rd ed by Burchfield) a couple of days ago. Says Fowler: ""The real occasion for the use of qua occurs when a person or thing spoken of can be regarded from more than one point of view or as the holder of various coexistent functions

""Qua lover he must be condemned for doing what qua citizen he would be condemned for not doing.""
Here, and the other singling out one of his or its aspects (lover, or citizen).""

This was the only way in which Fowler preferred the word be used

between identical nouns (""X qua X"") as an emphatic version of ""as"":
""The presence of actual words is apt to confuse any estimate of the evocative power of the music qua music.""

""I don't think that 'Hard Times' is a particularly good novel qua novel

""James Kirkup's poem about Jesus … is … an indefensibly bad poem qua poem.""
And sometimes
""It cannot, it cannot, as a film,…]

""Qua phonetician

""Dressed in an Armani suit and espadrilles
But the word can seem pretentious
