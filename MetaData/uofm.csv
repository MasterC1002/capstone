All of my attempts at finding a roommate so far have failed because people either a) found the place I liked too expensive or b) are already tied up in a lease.  I don't want to live with a complete random (craig's list scares me) so maybe a redditor would be a better option

I already found a place I liked and I'm signing the lease for it this week.  Some info about the place:  The rent is 1500/month (if split even 750/person)

It's on S. Fifth near Packard in a beautiful house.  This is kind of in the central/south neighborhood.  I love the location because it's close enough to my fav bars (Arbor Brewing, and stadiums (I have football and basketball tickets).   


Some info about me:  I'm a female, video games and sports.  I'm okay with a male or female roommate, as long as you are tidy and polite.

More about me:  I'm a great cook


Feel free to PM me for more info

So tomorrow

As of now, and I'm still waiting on a message I sent to one of them asking about it. I don't live in Ann Arbor, but was planning on trying to make it out there tomorrow anyway.

Being from one of the most politically active schools in the nation, does. This could just mean showing up wherever it is happening (if we don't know by tomorrow, I guess it'll just have to spread by word of mouth during the day, or we could take the reigns and figure it out here). But even if you can't come out, wave signs, or do anything like that, spread the word that it's happening. The bigger media outlets are expected to give this minimum coverage while still using Snowden as a distraction to divert attention from the fact that..... ya know

This thread could be used to discuss or for anything else pertaining to it

We purposefully leased a house on South Campus this year because we were a house of eight active guys who enjoy playing pick-up sports and wanted to be close to field space. The University ended up fencing off the whole park and closed everything down until the summer because they didn't want to pay people to staff the field. Now I can't play soccer or anything when I get off work because they lease the space to look youth organizations. Does this piss anyone else off? Maybe this is being fueled by my preexisting hatred for Rec Sports (another issue entirely) but I feel that a part of my tuition should be reimbursed for them taking back some of the resources to which I was expecting access.

I have a couple of questions I hope some of you wouldn't mind answering? I know you guys get some of these same questions fairly regularly (I've read through a lot of them) but it probably doesn't hurt to get more opinions

* I've heard both that living on Central is more fun than North, particularly Aero Eng)  On the flip side, how fun exactly is it living on Central if you're an Engineering student?

* **Is there stuff to do around North campus** (restaurants

* **What's the difference between all the Northwoods?** Which one's the best? What about the other accommodation options?

* **Are US on-campus accommodations all shared?** ""2 Occupants share 1 bedroom apartment"" doesn't sound all that appealing to me. Isn't that a bit... invasion of privacy and tight fitting? Different culture I guess, you know, having the ability to strip naked without worrying about disturbing a roomie.

* Still talking about accommodation - would you guys recommend getting **somewhere off-campus instead?** I'd love to experience the local life and get the whole A2 experience down

* As a 4th year student in a 5 year degree

* **Meal plans** - how useful are these? Self catering is pretty common here and I'm used to it, or not so much?

* **How exactly do fraternities work?** I still can't understand this whole ""rush"" process. Are they even open to exchange students

* I want to have an awesome American college experience and meet tons of people. As an Eng student

* **What's Detroit really like?** I must say

Thanks for any answers

One of those sources is a competition between colleges to get the closest hash.

[We're currently ranked sixth

So all you have to do is [go here.](http://almamater.xkcd.com/)

Enter ""umich.edu"".

And then enter literally any string of text and hit ""Go Hash.""  It'll then tell you how you did.  Lower is better.

Now honestly, so the odds aren't very good.  Or we need incredible, stupid good luck.  But we made it to sixth, and obviously Carnegie Melon had some amazing luck, so if your bored, give it a shot.  I just think it'd be neat to see UofM mentioned on the comic.

Oh

I was just wondering if you guys knew anybody who switched to IOE from a major that they hated (which caused them to have a low GPA) or someone who just has a lower GPA overall.

I was just wondering how possible is it to land an internship with a lower IOE gpa (like.. 2.7~3.3).

Just a background info... I'm ending my sophomore year as an Electrical Engineer. The whole semester, and possibly even the course. As for 270, I'm not sure how I did, but I still bombed the second midterm.

I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of interest

But if anybody could help me out

**TLDR; How successful are IOE majors with low GPAs?**

EDIT: Small clarification. When I entered college, but because it seems to be more business-like. Currently, I wish I was a business major, not an engineering major, but it's too late for that. However, I tried out Electrical Engineering, because I heard patent law programs prefer EE's over any other type of engineers. I now realize that doing EE just for a law program isn't worth it.

I'm definitely applying to this school, 31 on ACT, lots of extracurriculars, challenging course load, etc. 
The only problem is money. My parents don't see the point in sending me to what they refer to as a ""lower tier"" school out of state 
I see their logic, everything. I seriously dislike the university that I would attend in my own state, as I have been there several times as well. I don't expect a full ride scholarship, but even if I got about 20K off, my parents MIGHT be convinced. The only way, as of now, that they would agree to send me out of state is if it was an Ivy League or something up there
How should I go about this situation? I know it's a pretty generic question with no real answer. But does Michigan generally offer scholarships/financial aid to OOS students? I am a pretty good student from a very competitive school
Are there any ways that I could maybe work on campus as freshman/help out to waive the OOS tuition? I know it's a bit early, I've always told myself I'll get to Michigan somehow, but now that the time is approaching, I am faced with how to actually solve these challenges.

I am actually in Flint, but I can go down there to talk to them. Would this show initiative/interest? I'll pretty much tell them about my passion. And how the only obstacle is literally the OOS fee.

In the interest of potentially saving some lives

The objective of the drive is to:

1) Disseminate information (e.g the methods of donating bone marrow

2) Collect saliva samples of interested people and enter that information into the bone marrow registry. 

The drive is backed by DKMS (http://www.dkmsamericas.org/)

I humbly ask that you inform people about this drive so that we can reach out to people that may be interested in being included in the bone marrow registry. 

The procedure is sometimes a last resort for many patients (e.g. when radiation therapy or chemotherapy fails)

Thank you

Drive participant.
