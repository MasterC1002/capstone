I've posted this in many threads over the past week, to save some folks some headaches.

No. Don't use GUIMiner. It's good to see if you want to mine

Try cgminer or bfgminer, and you'll find plenty of help there.

The rest of the post will be using commands and settings based on [BFGMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=168174.0) so go grab a copy and play along. I'm also going to assume you're in windows

Run the client with the options like this either in a command prompt or from a shortcut(or you can just run the .exe and follow the onscreen instructions to set up a pool):

    bfgminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:3333 -u YourWorkername -p WorkerPassword

Once you're in the program, saving all your settings. Now to run the program in the future all you need to do is run the .exe (no need for the extra options now)

To change anything, look up JSON formatting. The easiest way to add more pools (for backup when your primary pool goes down, etc) is from bfgminer itself by hitting ""P"" then ""A"" and follow the onscreen prompts. once your new pool is added, make sure you save your config file like we did before.

For how to squeeze every last MH/s out of your chips

In your bfgminer.cfg at the top should be your primary and backup pools

    ""intensity"" : ""9""
    ""vectors"" : ""2""
    ""worksize"" : ""128""
    ""kernel"" : ""diablo""

with a bunch of other options at the bottom that you don't need to change(if you have 2 or more gpus,d"" for intensity). You can mess with the intensity, 9 is the max you'll want to go at all, but if you still want to use the desktop that is being rendered, you'll want to go down to ""d"" which is a dynamic intensity. Try modifying the vectors try out 1, 2, 4, 64

Play with these settings, vectors, and worksize that works for your GPU.

Once this is done, as Bitcoin isn't memory intensive like other cryptocurrencies. Afterburner makes it easy to have multiple profiles so you can easily switch between mining and gaming. Both cgminer and BFGMiner come with some overclocking capabilities integrated, but I've not had much luck with them. You can try it yourself, but I've had much more reliable and stable results by using AB.

I think I've covered most of it

Shortly after GPUs became popular for bitcoin mining, they've been around for a while for crackers and other security-conscious folks looking at ways to defeat cryptographic locks. Hey! I know something that uses cryptographic calculations to secure its network! BITCOINS! Yep, so some miners developed their own boards and slapped some FPGA chips on them (most commonly the Spartan-6), and wrote specific firmware and ""bitstreams"" to more efficiently calculate bitcoin hashes. The first generations were sort of slow, but still they had better efficiency than a GPU. Some of the latest generation included the Icarus boards, Cairnsmore, x6500

In early 2012(i think my timeline is right), and one thing only. Bitcoins. This is all it can do, and can't really be repurposed like an FPGA to other applications. Who wouldn't want a US$150 ""Jalapeno"" that hashes at 3.5 GIGAhashes/s using only power from a USB port?? Crazy! So summer 2012, BFL says they will ship before Christmas. Various things happen and we now still don't have any confirmed ship dates from BFL.

A few other companies have sprouted up, I own one, and love it.) where he took many preorders, promised lots of people amazing ASIC performance, but in early 2013 the stress of the whole endeavour got to him and he gave up, refunded money(I think it's still being refunded now, or maybe it's been cleared up already.)

Avalon is the only company we know has ASIC mining hardware in the wild. It is not certain exactly how many are out there

All of this info is gleaned from the [Custom Hardware forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=76.0) over at bitcointalk.org over the past year or so I've been involved in bitcoin. I may have some facts wrong

So

*This is a scam/Why should I trust you?*

Of course

* I've been on Reddit over two years - this would be a very complicated way to scam someone.

* I'll be sending mods my personal information so that they (and you) are free to sue me if this turns into a scam.

* I have at least one positive bitcoin related transaction under my belt - http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1cb45l/games_that_come_along_with_my_mining_gpus_for/c9g7jfd?context=3

* I'm a law student (see my posts on /r/lawschool) and currently applying for a moral character determination in California. Scamming you would really screw up my professional career.

* I'm requiring that transactions be posted here to increase transparency. People will be able to tell if/when money has been sent

*Why all the legalese?*

Like I just said

That being said

In the first section, place the order promptly, and ship the order. If I can't do that, I'll refund your bitcoins (none of the BFL bullshit where they take your bitcoins, wait for the market to explode, and refund you in cash).

If you want to order, and PM me where to ship your order to.

The other stuff: Don't sue me in timbuktu, first shipped.

*I don't have bitcoins - can I use paypal or something?*

Nope; that might make me a money transmitter under FinCEN regs

So I've posted here a few times in the past. Now I'll detail what I'm doing a little further and try to help others.

Right now I'm working with 5x 7950's, and 3x GTX 580's (my gaming rig). My hash rate is about 4,500 MH/s. I started this project using the DRIP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_reinvestment_plan) principles in mind. I call this MRIP (Mining Reinvestment Plan). The plan is to reinvest all bitcoins mined into more mining hardware. Today I just purchased two more 7950's that are due to arrive tomorrow. Note that these two cards were purchased with bitcoins that were mined. This should bring my hash rate up to about 5660 MH/s, which will let me purchase another card next monday. The plan is every time I have enough to buy another card, I withdraw the bitcoins and convert it into cash. At this rate I'm hoping to have about 48 additional 7950 cards by the end of June or about 33,000 MH/s (33GH/s).

To those I haven't gotten back with about hardware that I'm ordering, I still haven't decided on a locked feature set - meaning I don't know what I'm going to buy (mobo, ram, cpu, psu, etc). Ideally I want to keep the core system down to about $70/PCI-e slot, but I have to factor in space (hashing density too).

I say this because hardware pricing is always changing

I run an IT consulting company on the side and thus I have A CRAP LOAD of old machines with a working PCI-e slot (or two or three). I'll be using these up and then will start building out a system.

Going back to mining, as I've been using old hand-me-down GPU's...

UltraSPARC_1 = 4x 7950's  UltraSPARC_2 = 1x 7950  UltraSPARC_3 = 6750  UltraSPARC_4/5/7 = 7850  UltraSPARC_6 = 3x GTX 580 UltraSPARC_8 = 2x 7950

1364695135.0,1bc3sg,When to Stop GPU Mining.,davosBTC,28,6,21,"The 7970 is

The question is

This is really simple math

The following assumes a miner is receiving a roughly equitable share of its contribution to the network's hash power (ie through a pool

Variables you can edit.

* Cost per kWh - I am assuming $0.15

* Card Cost and Amortization - it is a generally accepted accounting principal (GAAP) to amortize the cost of an asset purchase over a 2-year lifespan. It probably makes more sense here to use 1-year

* The BTCUSD exchange rate.

That's it

------------------------

**Question 1:** What is the daily cost of operation for a 7970 (not including the rest of the computer)?

* A 7970 has a *reported* power draw of 250W
* 250W running all day is 6 kWh per day.
* 6 kWh per day is $0.90 per day @ $0.15 per kWh
* At $90/BTC
* At $400 on NewEgg
* $0.55 is 0.0061 BTC

**Operating Costs** = 0.0161 BTC

----------------------------------------
**Question 2**: How much of the network will I have to capture with my card to earn *at least* 0.0161 BTC per day?

* The network yields approximately 3600 BTC per day (25 bitcoin / block * 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours per day)
* 0.0161/3600 = 0.0004472%

**Answer:** The card must be capturing **0.0004472%** of the total network to earn at least 0.0161 BTC per day.

---------------------------------------

**Question 3:** How big does the network have to be before the 7970 is no longer profitable?

* The 7970 operates at a **reported** 650MH/s
* This will remain profitable until 650MH/s is less than 0.0004472% of the total network.
* 650(MH/s) / 0.000004472 =  145.3 TH/s

**Answer**: The 7970 will be profitable until the total network hashrate exceeds **145.3 TH/s**.

-----------------
Summary
---
This is just an easy maths model you can use to apply to any question you may have with regard to the 'potential profitability' of your current graphics card or even your potential ASIC purchase. If you know how much hashing power the card has

This is **not** a predictive model of when on the calendar your device will be obsolete

http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jn0cn/yes_you_can_get_your_refund_from_bfl_through/

Except that I used my credit card through paypal directly to pay BFL.  Paypal did not hold any funds

*  I sent a polite and short email to office@butterflylabs.com requesting a full refund due to lack of promise &amp; product in a timely fashion. 

I was denied (within 24 hours) and told that units were already shipping in a short canned response.  (They are still in July of 2012 and my order was in February 2013)

* The next day

This immediately got closed because of the 45 day window that Paypal has.  

* Now

I did have to explain my story.  They do have a 45 day window for ""Pre-Orders"" but this was ""Pre-Production"".  Which Paypal should never have backed.  This is where my story forks from the sticky post.

* I used my credit card (visa) through Paypal with no funds in my Paypal account.  Paypal immediately told me that I would have to contact my card and issue a charge-back from my card to Paypal.

I took a moment and repeated the scenario that the Paypal agent just described.  ""You want me to file a charge back from my card to Paypal?  I have no problems with the Paypal service and do not want to be in bad standing with Paypal""

* The Paypal agent assured me that this was the procedure and once issued Paypal and my Visa card would work together.  Once my Visa card issued a charge-back, if I truthfully had not received my product.

So this ended my communication with Paypal.  I had a notepad at this point of the charges/dates in question

* Now

I have been with my card company for 15+ years.  I have never once filed a charge-back and been in great standing with them.  

* The Visa agent came back and told me that they were initiating the charge-back.  They also stated that they are pro-rating my card the amount of the charge.  They would mail me paperwork within a week to have a paper copy.  To keep my invoice and any information I had on my order.

http://web.archive.org/web/20130123144425/http://www.butterflylabs.com/ I love this website. This was the last page before my order was placed.

* So the day I receive the letter in the mail from my Visa card

**By the way

* I am in a holding pattern at the moment.  I have not seen a credit back or any activity from Butterfly Labs or Paypal other than the emails and these new invoice number &amp; refund numbers on my BFL account.  


At this point I feel better.  BFL never had the intention of filling their orders efficiently for the public.  I hope more people keep following suit.  This is my story and I am still in limbo right now.  Please ask me any questions or suggestions about your situation and I will try to relate it to mine.

It seems that you can't really mine long enough to break even before the ASIC's come out and make it unprofitable. Though, sell the GPU for for probably more than half the original price which would cut down the time to break even quite a bit.

This was new to me as this was my first pre-order purchase on eBay

Basically, you have **45 days to open a case with eBay if you didn't receive the item and get your money back**.

So unless your order date was very early, even if the seller decides to not send the miner to you. Now this is only my advice, but **I would strongly recommend not going outside the 45 day window**, in hopes of getting your miner, especially with ROI decreasing by the day. Do this only if you can afford to lose the money you spent. 

This is just to make everyone aware of eBay's policies and that there may still be time to get your money back if you're still within the 45 day window. This helped me get my money back and hopefully it will be useful to some of you.

We are aware of the concerns in the bitcoin community. The concern as to the images used is justified as the ASIC chip is indeed an example of a future product-part. The case, PDU etc. The testing does, however not demonstrate a finished product whatsoever.

&gt;Our supplier has already shown the capability of producing the required hardware. Thus, it seems meaningful to address the community regarding its concerns. We will dedicate our time to update and provide additional information for the coming period.

7/28/13: I admit I was feeling a bit uneasy about this Avalon clone ASIC miner order I made with ASX Project. The ""resources"" on Bitcoin Talk still sees this as a straight scam.

So there has been a lot of talk about FPGA and ASIC miners recently

Here's where it gets interesting. There are multiple companies that do FPGA-to-ASIC migrations for this exact purpose. The ""R&amp;D lab"" has a stable setup with their FPGA and want to get it into production. It would make little sense to use expensive and slower FPGA's

Now this is what I'm thinking

I've come across multiple companies that do this (it seems pretty common practice) such as this one that even offers pin compatibility which would make our lives even easier: http://www.gigoptix.com/component/k2/item/325-pin-pin.html

I did research but there is an iverwhelming amount of info out there and a lot of it is contradictory. I have never done GPU mining as my computer does not have the proper hardware. 

My budget is $500 so building a rig is not really am option and I have been looking into getting an ASIC miner

My questions are:

1. Does it make sense to invest in an ASIC miner right now? Will I be able to make up the money in a reasonable amount of time and start turning a profit soon? I am mot looking to make a ton of money from this but more so to learn. However i do not want to lose money in the process. Excluding energy costs as they are free since I am at college. 

2. Is the Eruptor USB a good choice for a miner and is it reliable or is there a better option that fits my budget?

3. For ASIC mining

Thank you for all your help.

Edit: TL;DR: does it even make sense to buy an ASIC miner with a 300 mh/s hashrate? Is there a more cost effective miner? Should I buy a GPU and build my own rig?

- I got the non-heatpipe heatsink version
- Unboxed and plugged in, I would have 3 systems going, and that little box was the loudest thing in the room.
- At those rates, pre price hike).  My plan was to mine back what I needed in BTC to pay for the device, plus a little extra (1.8 BTC was my total target).. then I started hearing about things one could do to push it a little further (remove from case, better fan, firmware upgrade to push faster, etc)...  so I spent about $100 in parts (jtag programer, cable, etc) and decided once my 1.8BTC was mined
- Meanwhile I started accumulating orders for a couple Block Erupter USBs for ~1BTC each, some other odds and ends (powered usb hub, etc), with the intent to power down my watt guzzling GPU rig entirely, instead of it sitting there running just to feed the ASICs..

This past weekend I opened the little black box of mystery and had some fun:

- Tore down, repeated removal and putting it back, I think you run the risk of them tearing over time (I have a couple small tears in mine when I took it off the first time)..
- I added some copper heatsinks (think Raspberry Pi heatsinks...) to the mosfest and a few other areas of the board that (to me) seemed to run hot.
- Replaced the stock fan (I'd heard the horror stories of fans breaking) with a low profile Noctua (92mm fan for anyone who is pondering)
- I flashed the firmware to the stock 1.25 firmware that's floating around..  They say you need to watch that the chips don't overheat while you have it powered up to flash as you can't put the heatsink and the flash cable on at the same time.. I'll admit, and I was still very worried about heat (cable up everything except power, mouse over the ""Erase!"" button in jtag software, power up BFL, smash Erase... chips go idle... load the firmware image, push ""Load"", as soon as the LED started showing activity (chips powered!) I ripped the power back out.
- I did all this in one sitting... maybe an hour total

I plugged everything back in, and it was fine.  Since then I've powered it off about 10-20 times, and twice it would go into ""super fast flash like crazy but not work"" mode. Simply unplugging and replugging would solve it. I have not dug into this at all, but I think it's failing to init or pass the boot up tests. There's word around town that you can tweak the firmware to push speed further or reduce the strictness of the tests it does, but I'm happy with what I've got, so I'm leaving it:

[Right now](http://imgur.com/ksUYqFS)

Other than to change coins or work on my host system (now that it's a raspberry pi I don't think I'll be changing it much more)

Right now my little rPi host is bashing away, but still may add a couple more to break 10Gh total just for bonus points), the jally firmware ""upgrade"" everyone talks about is really designed for one of the other models (the bigger ones), and that's why I think it reports as ""BFL 0h"" or ""BFL 0d"" I assume ""d"" and ""h"" are the two ASIC spots on the jally board that actually have chips on them in the jally...

I figure all in I'm looking at around... lets say $650 and 90 watts (max) total for ~8.29Gh/s...  The erupters really distort my numbers right now

The jally power supply has always seemed to run hot to me, and more erupters will sadly mean I need a new usb hub, as my current one is only rated for 5v 2A, and it has to be close to that with 3 erupters, the pi, and the usb fan. :/  So I guess I've still got more investment to go, but it's just a hobby, right?

right?




tl;dr edition (or what I learned

- Yes, flip the fan.  Your temp will drop and (with a new quiet fan atleast, I can't vouch for the oem fan), it's much quieter.  Use the ""top"" of the case as the new ""bottom"", and leave the sides and top off.

- Yes, and FRC with the BFL/Erupter setup... I found one SHA256 recently that choked with rejects, I can't remember the name, but it was one of the recent new SHA256 based coins.

- Yes, no better chips necessarily , so if you buy the 7gh upgrade, you are probably not going to push it to 10g or something crazy with the firmware.. note that doing this does void your warranty as far as BFL is concerned.

- CPU mining is basically not worthwhile anymore. Unless you have a ton of computers sitting around idle? Such as a system admin of a school who can run a miner on a large number of computers during non-school hours.

- GPU mining is almost one foot out the door.  If you have equipment already you might as well use it; but the days of going out and running 4+ GPUs are no longer worth it due to initial costs and power consumption?

- FPGA - I haven't been able to dig up much of information

- ASIC - this is the current top dog

- Butterfly labs has been selling per-orders for ~5-6 months now

1364930657.0,1bj950,[Help] Looking to get started. Questions and Concerns,TheGadgetCat,10,1,10,"So, but this would allow it to fall back as a great gaming rig if mining doesn't turn out. The plan was also to set up some liquid cooling to keep it from running too hot. I think this investment would be around $1500 max (This includes some money for an initial direct investment in bitcoins / litecoins). 

I have done a bit of research for the past few days on this, that's okay. However, I know that a lot of people are saying NOT to get into bitcoin mining due to the new ASIC miners coming out that are going to fuck the difficulty for GPU rigs. I also hear a lot of people saying that getting into Litecoin mining is an alternative due to it's low hash rate requirement. However, won't ASICs also screw the difficulty here as well, despite it being very low right now (compared to bitcoins)?

Last concern I have is that I want to try out litecoin mining a bit first. However, and the 7970M would pull 320 - 350 Mh/s which isn't awful. However, the temps would get upwards of 90C, and the CPU while litecoin mining would get to about 89C with only 1.5 Mh/s. Now I may be wrong, but this seems too hot. I tested these temps against the load from Hitman: Absolution, and while it wasn't quite maxed, it would still run the temp up to about 90C. I've played this and many other high demand games for over a year

Rundown: 

If I'm not paying for power

Is this planned rig even a good idea

Have I missed the boat entirely and is bitcoin / litecoin mining just not a good idea in general anymore?

Would it be safe for my laptop to run some litecoin mining on it for short 1hour spurts?

After registration you should find your worker name &amp; password

In the CGminer terminal window

then type in your username (workername) and then your password.

You can automate this process by typing ""./cgminer -o stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333 -u workername -p password""

If you have an ATI card like me you probably want to overclock and adjust fan speed

aticonfig --od-enable (Enables ATI Overdrive)

aticonfig --od-setclocks=coreclock, num=0,1,2 or all where 0 is default)

aticonfig --pplib-cmd ""set fanspeed 0 100"" (Sets fanspeed to 100%

This command checks the clock
aticonfig --odgc --adapter=all


And this one temperature:
aticonfig --odgt --adapter=all

What I understand is that when you mine in a pool you can report hashes with a lower difficultly then the network requires

Question is what stops a miner from submitting proof-of-works to a pool but in case they actually complete a block they secretly don't report that to a pool but report it to the network as a solo miner. Does the pool keep some information secret so no individual could submit the block they are working on?

Kudos to 50btc.com for taking care of the issue and if you find that your GPU is being used while your PC is idle start by looking at the task manager as regular virus programs will no detect miners *yet*. Malware Bytes will tag cgminer and others as PUP (Potentially unwanted programs) but this is only on a full scan. Track down the offending exe and before you delete it run a wireshark and see where it is mining too.

I've been using a Radeon HD 6950 at stock speeds and catalyst 11.6 to mine and it was able to mine overnight without incident a few weeks earlier.

I have also heard that the 6950 is prone to locking up whenever you are mining and you try to open a video with hardware acceleration enabled (I can consistently freeze my computer if I open youtube while mining) but opening youtube is hard when I'm asleep.

Not sure if this is relevant but the last two days (which I've attempted to mine overnight) one day I started mining at around 10 P.M. and the second day the mining had been going on all day from around 9 A.M.

Has anyone else run into this or have any suggestions on how to fix this?

* Physical Setup
* Any particular settings while using the miner program on linux to max out the performance on my 2x 7970's and 3x 7770's
* Do you gain parts of bitcoins when you SoloMine

I'll post pictures and videos of all the fun I have with this adventure :D

I'm not in the US so ordering from Cablesaurus is not really practical

Results with stock cards
GPU 0: 70.0C 3486 RPM 575 Mh/s
GPU 1: 59.0C 2814 RPM 614 Mh/s

So after a long time figuring out why GPU 0 was hotter and slower then the GPU 1 was due to the fact that it was on the inside of the motherboard... or it could just be something else. 

Had to take out the motherboard out of its case too so that might be a problem to why its not cooling enough

The motherboard is a MSI 880G-E45, 1x(back cut out to allow 2nd card to be inserted onto mobo).

When I try to boot up with a card attached to the 3rd slot via extender cable

What works:
-Booting up in safe mode
-Booting up WITHOUT GPU drivers installed
-Booting up with PCI lock enabled
-Booting up with card removed from the 3rd slot
-All the GPUs work
-I used tape on the card in the 16x slot to limit it to 1x

-Disabling clock frequencies to unused PCI slots

Clear

Remember that gambles and risks need to have a possible upside to be a gamble or a risk

+++++++++

If you're new to mining then you should be using The Genesis Block calculator to help make your purchase decisions.  Less capable calculators can mislead you by not factoring difficulty increases

If you don't understand the fields then you need to understand them in detail before you make a move.  Feel free to ask questions.

It's here:

http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/

Put the numbers that apply to your purchase into ""Market &amp; Hardware Parameters.""  Some critical notes:

* Note that it is currently only autofilling 52% into Difficulty Increase Per Month.  This is unrealistic.  You should hand enter whatever percentage you see in Historical Difficulty Increases -- 30 Day (currently 98%) above.

* Set ""Initial Mining Date"" to when you realistically expect to plug the unit in.  Be **very** careful here.  Manufacturers are missing their ship dates left and right and even a single month can mean the difference between small gains and tremendous losses.

After you press calculate you will see how much money you will make (or lose) over the next year with the configuration you entered.

You can also choose some standard configurations from various hardware companies from the ""Select a Company: dropdown.

Please take that payout assessment seriously. At this point

Unrealistic optimism and gold fever are rampant in the mining world and decent people are losing quite a lot of money on their own inability to let go of what was once a cool thing

I know I’m not going to make a pile of money.

I’m thinking of putting my computer to work when I’m at work. I have read that my Nvidia card isn’t the best


I do have a Raspberry Pi and  BeagleBone Black that can chip in as well that I can leave running 24/7.


I figure this could be a side project that can earn a **little** extra cash. I was kind of planning to get started on what I have


Thanks for reading and hopefully helping.


Edit: I got it working on my PC. I'm currently mining at a paltry 85 Mhash/s. I knew it was going to be slow due to the video card. I'll go at it like this until I can get in on a group buy on an ASCIMiner or 2. Then I'll put my Pi to work as a host.

So I made the switch to Slush's pool and it's been about 24 hours so far. My first impressions are VERY positive. I was at BTC Guild bringing in about 0.35 BTC/day and so far after the move it's bumped up to about 0.38 BTC/day! My only issue so far is sometimes the miner hash view is buggy (will get stuck at 0 MH/s). I like to keep an eye on my miners so that's the only drawback. I'm working to make some scripts and convert all of my machines over to Linux which will make monitoring easier and the issue I laid out above a moot point.

Take the infos you need : the number after platform is the one you need.


make a .bat to launch cgminer and add ""-d X"" with X the number of your card you want to use.

1366172267.0,1cihal,Question regarding the increasing difficulty of mining with the influx of ASIC units,ihaveabu,3,0,4,"So I'm doing some math to figure out projected income from buying a ASIC unit (I'm looking at the Butterfly Lab models).

**According to this chart:** http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-lin-ever.png

difficulty has increased approximately 5e+6 in the past 6 months.

According to this wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty
the **difficulty changes as every 2016 blocks** are mined.

The current network mining speed based on: http://bitcoincharts.com/
is 6.9 blocks/521 seconds or 1144 blocks/day at 61.989 TH/s or 61989 GH/s

From the same site, difficulty will increase in 1e+6 every 2016 blocks, or 2 days. 

So at the current speed of 1144 blocks/day

So by 5/17/2013

With this said

Assuming an arbiturary value of units in the initial shipment of 500 units


Given all of this

5GH/s (not including initial investment of equipment)

Current difficulty: 7e+6

Current USD/bitcoin ~ $68

Current monthly profit: $620

Current yearly profit: $6000

Factoring in the rising difficulty of 15e+6 per month (not at all taking into account the influx of ASIC units to the global mining speed):

In 6 months

**This decreased the monthly profit from $620 to $35.**



Doing the same calculations using the faster models yield slightly more reasonable results




My question is this. Will bitcoin difficulty likely increase in the way I predict. If so


And I just found this guy's set of calculations. Mine are very conservative in the difficulty increase

(Reposted from /r/Bitcoin)",RyanW1019,3,9, I made it to [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining) page about mining. The basic message I took from it is that CPUs &lt;&lt; GPUs &lt;&lt;&lt; ASICs. CPUs have been rendered obsolete, overclocked AMD graphics cards


Supposedly, my research revealed that they've been delaying shipping for over half a year, and nobody has actually recieved one yet. If you ordered one now, you'd get it in several months (excluding the almost-certain delays to come). Avalon is another ASIC manufacturer, and they actually ship; however, the going rate for one of their ASICs is about 77 BTC, which is anywhere from $7000-$10000

On top of this, as well as the mining difficulty, and profit will decrease dramatically for everyone involved. I was hoping to buy either a high-end GPU or a low-end ASIC (not spending more than a few hundred dollars) and make a couple hundred dollars of profit after a few months. But now it seems that ASICs are a myth (or hideously expensive), GPUs are very expensive, and all miners are soon going to start seeing diminishing returns.


All things considered, I'll either try actually buying some bitcoin and hoping for the market to recover or just follow Bitcoin's ups and downs as an outside observer.

Since it's a non-profit and I'm still in school, I've had this recent idea to try making the industry minimum by using all of these ""computer lab"" PCs for bitcoin mining.

All of them (with the exception of two in the library) are about 5 to 10 years old. I have room for about 17 computers in this lab (possibly 20) and due to some law of the universe where elementary, I have about 12 working. When I first got the job, most/all of them were full of malware and spyware, some running unlicensed copies of XP Pro so I have Ubuntu 10.04 on them. I'll be in the process of upgrading them over this week and next week.

The majority of the computers are these donated HP desktops that are dual-core P4s @ 2.5 GHz. The video cards are GeForce MX 440s (8x AGP). About four are Dell Optiplexes: single core P4s at 2.5 GHz with ATI Rage 128 Pros. The two library computers have integrated Intel GPUs and Pentium dual-core E200s.

Since I doubt I can do GPU mining, then all the computers could run ufasoft and talk to the MMP server via JSON RPC unless there's a CPU miner that speaks MMP.

Has anyone done anything like this before? Does anyone have any advice? Is there a better way to do this? I spent most of yesterday reading up on bitcoin, that's why.

So I started mining during downtime on my budget gaming rig.  Just a single 7770 mining at about 180 MH/s.

Sometime today while I was away my box was either disturbed or it restarted on its own.  I of course didn't know this for hours until I came home.

Is there a way to get a notification if my miner stops?  An email or SMS?
