My goal here is to be pretty open

**1.**Your device **MUST** be useable

**2.**You **MUST** include a short description about your device. We don’t want a paper but let us know how things are put together

**3.**Your device cannot contain any pre-made
*The exception to this rule is a bowl/slide. We’ll except a submission that has a pre-made bowl and slide

**4.**If you have access to glass blowing equipment
*Please include proof that you blew/made the device yourself however.

**5.**Although not a rule

**6.**You **MUST** include a picture of your device

That’s pretty much it for the rules

-Although only a picture is required, videos, anything!!!

-You can submit your device by messaging the mods

-If you include step-by-step instructions with your submission (not required) and you give us permission

The contest begins today (24 September, and I will post several reminders as we draw closer to the end date.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/YRcx2)  the bong that I made yesterday!

I made this out of 2 water bottles, and our (RIP Cersei) bong's old piece. The top water bottle was used as an ice catcher, the bottom one had water at the bottom that the pen (stem) went in to. The piece was bigger than the pen, so it fit OVER the pen and that's why it's hard to see.

ANYWAY! While I was making this, electrical tape, a piece, and a pen) that we had to use to create the best smoking apparatus? We could post our masterpieces as comments on the mod post, and the post with the most upvotes wins! We could call it: MacGyver Mondays or something like that!

This is where how the launch box works / what it is made of / etc.. were figured out for the first time.

[DIY MFLB v1 Overview](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/bpba6/diy_launch_box_pictures_video_materials_breakdown/) -- Pictures / Videos / Material &amp; Tools List / General breakdown With some ideas for the next incarnation.

[Video Download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/i9f49s) -- video download showing the diy launch box

**Note: The following information for the most part can be put together by digging around those first two threads.  This is just meant to bring it all together.**

A while back I really wanted a launch box

**The following threads make it clear for the most part how the launch box operates

* [FC Forum - Launch Tube Thread](http://fuckcombustion.com/viewtopic.php?id=673&amp;p=4)  -- The launch tube is the precursor to the launch box, although page 1 has better shots of  the battery mechanism

* [FC Forum - Launch Box Beta Thread](http://www.fuckcombustion.com/viewtopic.php?id=818)

* [FC Forum- Lauch Box Retail Thread](http://www.fuckcombustion.com/viewtopic.php?id=909&amp;p=1)

* [Instructables Thread](http://www.instructables.com/answers/How-does-the-Magic-Flight-Launch-Box-vaporizer-wor/)

After reading through all of that

**Next

I came up with the materials list trying to dupliate the launch box exactly based on a materials list provided by a magic flight representative

The first thing you will want is a schematic of what you are building.  The one I made is available [here](http://i.imgur.com/1WWzc.jpg).  There are [several](http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/F6G/E1W9/GFI0HGBY/F6GE1W9GFI0HGBY.MEDIUM.jpg) other [versions](http://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/F7P/A4ZM/GFMBYOB4/F7PA4ZMGFMBYOB4.MEDIUM.jpg) people have made since on the instructables page

The materials used:

* Red Maple Wood Block (I got mine at Lowes
* [1/2"" x 6"" copper pipe hook](http://www.amazon.com/Sioux-Chief-506-36CPK2-Copper-Plated/dp/B000UFNXKY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hi&amp;qid=1270967393&amp;sr=8-4), but has a good picture -- just go to the pipe section at a large hardware store and you will find it.  I got at least 5 launch boxes worth) - Cost about $2
* [Stainless Steel Tea Ball](http://www.amazon.com/Progressive-Stainless-Steel-Mesh-Ball/dp/B00004RIZ7/ref=pd_sbs_k_1), tiny flecks get through when it is really dried and ground.  Something like [this](http://www.twpinc.com/images/products/detail/060X040S0065W36T.jpg), which is available [here](http://www.twpinc.com/twpinc/control/category/~category_id=TWPCAT_SS_Fine/~pcategory=TWPCAT_12) -- I'm guessing about .006"" mesh, 304 stainless steel) - Cost about $2, but I had one anyway
* Plexiglass cover (I went to michaels crafts framing department and had them cut a few for me -- paid about Five bucks for 6)
* [Batteries](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-2500-Rechargeable-Batteries-4-pack/dp/B0007LBVHI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1270967252&amp;sr=1-1) -- atleast 2000 mah

Materials total: $20, and that twelve bucks gets you at least enough material to make five or so launch boxes.

The tools used:

* Wood saw (mine was just a hand lumber saw
* [Spade drill bits](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-71-536-4-Inch-Assortment/dp/B00099E7WE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hi&amp;qid=1270967838&amp;sr=1-1) (I used 1 1/16"" for the large circle above the trench
* Regular drill bit (To drill holes to connect copper rods to trench area.  Just compare it to the pipe hangers, but not crazy hard to push in.  One of my standard bits was absolutely perfect, I just forget the size)
* Regular drill bit (I used another size to drill the hole you inhale through
* [Wood Chisel
* Sand paper
* Metal snips to cut the wire.  They have to be heavy duty to take that piece of metal on.  I took it into the hardware store and said ""I need something that will cut this""

So after looking over all of that you should have a good idea of what you are going to build

**A Few Helpful Build Tips:**

* I start by drilling the holes for the rods.  It makes the most sense

* I didn't weld anything.  My screen is being held in place by being pinned down by the rods.  I drilled the holes far enough so that the rods have to 'slip' into a little notch on the bowl side of the launch box as well

* Those metal rods are hard as hell to work with.  Supposedly tig welding rods are the same material and more malleable.  I plan to try those instead of the pipe hangers next time.

* For those that want to weld

EDIT: 
I wanted to link to a few of the DIY Launch Box threads that have spawned since then

For example

I would suggest that you pair that screen template with [my dimensions template](http://i.imgur.com/1WWzc.jpg) and use the two in tandem.  Screen cutting was a bitch

Truth is

A lot of folks seem to have an issue with him.. (his upvote to downvote ratio seems to run about 3:1 lately)  I guess some of you either think he's a really elaborate troll (considered this, to be fair, he is)

Here's the thing.  Love him or hate him, perfectly safe bongs**.    If he had been posting stuff made of plastic, or ridiculous creations that probably wouldn't last a whole session, I might be with the haters on this one.   But he's not.

He's done his homework, is a *good* approach for starting out), but also **effective and safe**.  I can't emphasize that last point enough. 

Folks, getting feedback and using that feedback to make better and safer designs.
Funkengruven88 may be failing on the 'make better' point

Here's the thing; homemade bong building is a phase a lot of stoners go through.  When you're living that phase, enthusiastic about your homemade creations*.   Sound like anyone we know?

  Eventually

When funkengruven88 moves on from his 'bong creator' phase, but he'll be able to look at his stuff and say to himself, 'Man, was I ever obsessed about making bongs.. what was I thinking?'  **BUT**, he'll also be able to say, '**Oh well... at least I managed to make something safe and functional that lasted 20 years**'.  

Now take a look at some of the gatorade bottle/duct tape/marker tube/socket wrench/straw perc creations on here and imagine the same scenario.  See how that works?

**To the haters**: You're totally allowed to downvote, take the time to write a short reply explaining *why* you don't like it, *what* don't think is safe and *how* you would improve upon it.   This is a builder's forum; no one is going to improve on their mistakes without good feedback like that, even if it is negative.   Trolling and insults don't belong here, or anywhere in the /r/trees family.  That's just how we roll, and ya'll know it.  Don't shit on enthusiasm; that's like... killing Bambi man.. *sniff*.  You're harshing my mellow.  


**To Funkengruven88**:  I won't say just ignore the haters
Consider trying some different stuff and mixing the designs up a bit.  I know you're working entirely in glass and this makes mods and construction much more difficult.  Here's a few thoughts.

**Safety**:  Congrats on using glass.  That's half the battle right there.  If you're drilling glass this often, but there is still some exposure risk.

**Mods to your creations**: The easiest things you start with are diffusing downstems and adding glass diffusion beads.  A smaller glass drill bit and some dollar store marbles are all you need to get you started.

From there

If you want to get really complex, but you can melt and shape soft glass using nothing but a propane torch or bunsen burner.  It's not the easiest or safest thing out there, but it is possible.   With a little imagination and experimentation, you could make a few basic percs.    Also keep in mind that there are some glues and adhesives out there that would be safe for use in small amounts on a secondary perc will away from the heat.  With a good glass cutter and some creativity, you might not even need the torch. 

If none of that floats your boat

Some food for thought.

.

**Materials Required**

* [**Stainless Steel Wire Mesh**](http://i.imgur.com/N4pEo.jpg) - From what I've read, and therefore the more heat output. I was limited by what was available at Home Depot, so I found a small round screen used for faucets. In my experience, a larger one would be preferable.
* [**1/8'' Copper Rod**](http://i.imgur.com/XFcq1.jpg) - This was by far one of the most difficult things to find and the one I am the least certain of. No one working at Home Depot knew where it would be, so I figured that would be a good one to try.
**NOTICE: [It was pointed out by another user](http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerEngineering/comments/q4utt/an_indepth_stepbystep_of_the_diy_portable_vape/c3usm0s) that copper could be hazardous as it can be dangerous when smoked out of/when copper dust is inhaled. While vaporizing doesn't produce as much heat as smoking
*  [**A Good Ol' Block of Wood**](http://i.imgur.com/auUnU.jpg) - I used a cheap piece of wood that I found in the baseboard section since the store didn't have any classier hardwoods. Just be sure that whatever you choose to use isn't treated or finished as this could be harmful to you.
*  [**1/8'' Acrylic/Plexi-glass Sheet**](http://i.imgur.com/PlVuZ.jpg) - You don't need anything expensive as far as this goes. I spent around $3 on a sheet large enough to make 10 more vapes.
*  [**A Single 3/4'' Wood Screw**](http://i.imgur.com/weIWa.jpg) - I used a brass round-head like the ones pictured because they were cheap and in packs of 6. Try to get some that aren't threaded near the head to allow the plexi-glass to swivel smoothly.
*  [**At Least One NiMH Rechargable AA Battery**](http://i.imgur.com/LpqDp.jpg) - From what I read

**Optional Materials**

*  **Sandpaper Sheets of Varying Coarseness** - The edges of your wooden block will most likely be relatively rough or pointed. Using fine-medium sandpaper will soften any edges you may have and help correct some potential mistakes.
*  **A Mouthpiece** - I haven't found one yet
*  **A Woodburning Pen** - I don't know if mine will feature this yet

**Tools You Will Probably Need Unless You Are a Master at Woodcarving**

*  **A Hand-Held Drill or Drill Press**, and a bit to match your wood screw head.
*  **A Saw** if your wooden block is not already the correct size. I used a band saw
*  **An X-Acto Knife or Box Cutter**
*  **A Ruler and Pencil**
*  **Wirecutters**

.

**The Process**

*Note: These steps pertain to [my design](http://i.imgur.com/NaIjG.png) and will differ for you depending on your materials or personal preference.*

1.  After collecting your materials, and 2'' wide.

2.  Using the drill press (or a dremel or router if you have one available), so you can keep the depth of the trench fairly even and controlled. Don't worry if your trench looks rough after this step, it's an easy fix with a little sand paper.

3.  Drill the holes for the battery (9/16''), the drill press is a great tool for the job thanks to the adjustable bit depth and the straight holes, but if you're using a hand drill you can probably still get pretty good holes with practice or experience.

4.  In order to connect your trench to your mouth hole

5.  Drill the holes for the copper rods (1/8'' or 5/32''). These holes will begin on the right side and should pass straight through the battery hole and end up in the trench as shown in my design.

6.  Use this time to sand down the wood as much as you desire. This process will become more difficult as you add components to the vape.

7.  Set your wooden block aside for a bit and cut your acrylic/plexi-glass to size. It should fit pretty much flush with the sides of the vape, you can simply snap the desirable section off [as shown here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evzq92HfNr8)

8.  Attach the plexi top to the vape using a wood screw in the corner. For best results

9.  Cut two sections of copper wire to the appropriate length. One should be longer than the other since it has to touch the positive terminal at the end of the battery. The other rod will be shorter because it only has to touch the side of the battery to use the negative terminal. (Note: The outer wrapper of the battery must be stripped away in order to use this method. You should be left with a solid chrome-colored battery that looks similar to those used in the MFLB).

10.  You can now either bend/cut your wire mesh to shape and put it snugly in the trench and then push the copper rods through the holes you made on the right side of the vape

11.  Ensure that the copper rods stay fairly firmly in place. I made the rod that touches the negative terminal a bit too short/made the hole a little too big

12.  Use either compressed air or your own lung strength to blow any remaining sawdust or other particles off/out of your creation add any finishing touches that you see fit.

13.  Try it out! I did a dry run of mine first by lightly resting my fingertip on the mesh and inserting the battery until I felt it start to heat up. Once you know that you're getting some heat

**READ THE EDITS**


I have been seeing lots of creative and cool homemade pieces, so let's all get our brain cranks going and put our ingenuity to the test.


Rule 1: The use of a purchased downstem and bowl is permitted but not required. Other materials must not be smoking-related.

Rule 2: Cost of purchasing materials must not exceed $30. The limit includes any purchased downstem or bowl.

Rule 3: The final product must function properly.

Rule 4: Contestants must document each step of construction via image or video. Contestants will submit the images/video in a self post

Rule 5: All planning and construction must be done specifically for this contest. Previous builds are not permitted.


Your prize is no longer strictly glory.  There will be physical prizes for the winners in their respective category (water piece

best budget build, largest, most easily recreated, and most stealthy. 


I have created a subreddit specifically for this contest called /SEcontest2012,  though if you feel your piece is cool enough by all means please do.  The voting system is simple.  Since the subreddit will be purely contest entries, just upvote the ones you think deserve to win, and downvote the ones you think aren't quite worthy.  At the end of January, we will see who has the top ranking post!


Good luck!  

**EDIT:**So this was mainly an idea starter and it seems that this is getting the attention I hoped for thus far.  I don't mean this to be noxings thing so it is totally open for the community to run with and create a tradition out of.  If anybody is willing to help with rewriting the rules

**EDIT 2:** Here is a quick link to the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/SEcontest2012) you should be submitting your designs to.

**EDIT 3:** Don't be afraid to upload videos as well

**EDIT 4:** User lolisthistaken has offered to give the winner of the contest a little something for first place

**EDIT 5:**  Voting system has been changed.  To prevent the advantage of early posting, pipe, and vaporizer.  There will also be sub-categories that can win also.

1) If there is no state change, like a flammable paint or something. This is why a plastic bowl is a bad idea. Plastic melts and burns under the flame of a lighter. If the body of a bong is made of plastic, it will likely not be exposed to enough heat to cause a state change. Something that does change state, like a wood pipe, opens you up to breathing in anything that is released in the very real smoke. For this to apply to aluminum, the temperature would have to be quite a bit higher than you'd be comfortable smoking out of.

2) Causation vs. correlation. People often state that Alzheimer's patients have a higher level of aluminum in their brain. There is literally no evidence saying that the aluminum CAUSED the Alzheimer's

3) If you are worried about smoking from a material

4) Don't repeat it unless you feel at least some measure of proof has been demonstrated. [There is a common myth that microwaving water makes in worse for you in some way.](http://www.snopes.com/science/microwave/plants.asp) It kind of sounds plausible, each person thinking and processing this information and some agreeing with it. But it doesn't really matter what you agree with, if it's true, it can be demonstrated with some kind of actual evidence.

**TL;DR: If aluminum makes you sick

various metals collect oily resins that have different properties of the resin that builds up in glass
about home made glass pieces as well
now dont start freaking out thinking you have glass in your lungs, and safe at the same time.
