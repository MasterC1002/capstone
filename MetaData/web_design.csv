Not to toot my own horn, so I went out and bought 3 excellent books on fonts and read them all. This helped tremendously. I also watched a introduction to typography [video](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2011-design/beautiful-typography-a-crash-course/) from adobe, and somewhere in the middle he talks about kerning.

The problem this whole time was related to my use of fonts: I had kerning set to 'zero' which, use the default ones"". In reality.... a value of zero kerning means ignore the kerning pairs (spacing for various combinations of letter forms) that the font developer has spent hundreds and thousands of hours perfecting, and apply an exact kerning value of zero, aka make my design look like complete shit.....  Thanks to reading those books though and watching the video... I have the knowledge to see now (quite glaringly) how bad it really looked the whole time, and very subtly too—where I couldnt quite put my finger on it. I always thought it was color, value, placement or something else and nothing would seem to fix the slight disharmony in my designs.

To fix this, then select Window &gt; Character. In the kerning box, click the dropdown and set it to 'optical' or 'metrics' instead of 0. 

http://i.imgur.com/se4Ym.png

You will want to use either of those, you will most definitely want it on 'metric,' which uses the kerning pairs that the typeface creator has meticulously crafted every combination for, in multiple font sizes.

If you're using a cheap or free font, and adobes calculations will be a tiny bit off, making the font appear unattached.

If you want to see how different this looks

Example 1 (Minion Pro):

Example 2 (TodaySHOP):

http://i.imgur.com/TOG4W.jpg

I would also recommend watching the video above, it still pops up occasionally and the improved justification settings magically make it look 100x better as well. He gives you the best values in the video too

**Real TL;DR:** In Photoshop

**Edit:** For all those who are in uproar about using Photoshop with fonts - I do WEB design which involves a lot of photo manipulation (eg. things like sliders which usually are text over photos which can be touched up, a logo, anything with paragraphs of text or even letter art, etc, i dont use photoshop.",,False,t5_2qh1m,True

It irked me that he didn't seem to care about lost customers

I have seen the same question over and over on web_design and webdev over and over every month. About 6-8 months ago I decided to make the 'end all be all' website that serves as a central hub for all tutorials/tools/assets... quite a large task

It has voting and favoriting similar to reddit

It also has tagging by topic

Signup isn't necessary

**Click on 'about' at the top to learn all the main features... there's a few hidden gems in there that aren't apparent just by glancing at the site.**

While I appreciate C&amp;C, so I'm somewhat nervous for feedback.

Here you are! 

http://pineapple.io

PS. I encourage you to add some resources that aren't on there. You (temporarily) don't need to create an account. It will remain this way until i start to get spam to make it incredibly easy to add things.

Edit: At the very least

Edit: I know currently they all say 'popular'. This is due to the site exploding and redefining what my subjective 'popular' criteria is. This will be adjusted along with other revisions when the traffic has died down and I can implement some other changes people have suggested.

I was referred to someone and sent him a proposal. Met with him and his people twice in lengthy meetings

I don't hear from him and assume he went with someone else.  

Two months later he contacts me saying he needs help fixing the site urgently.  I look and see he had some one try and install a Wordpress template and clearly didn't know what they were doing. It appeared he took my proposal and used it to do the work internally

I tell him it is harder to fix the issues they created then start over and the price is not going to change.  After a few minutes of him arguing with me

Ok so obviously at this point I'm done. I politely tell him I will have to pass on his project.

Here is where it gets good.

He asks if he can ""use my Indian"".

I was like wtf?!? What Indian??? 

He apparently thought my Polynesian partner was Indian and wanted to hire her directly and if not could she recommend a reliable Indian worker. He says that she would appreciate the work and he would even pay her $10 an hour.  He was dead serious and truly thought he was making a reasonable request.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the feedback. I'm extremely excited to keep working on this. Here are some things I've gathered.

1. The more and more tools I add

2. **Easy or no registration.** I hate making new accounts just as much as the next guy

3. **More information at a glance &amp; perhaps comments.** Maybe instead of sending you right to the site, tell the user what they could use it for. Comments would be helpful too, allowing users to link to things they have created using the utility. 

4. **Page real-estate is my enemy right now**. I will have to redesign the boxes a little bit to fit more stuff in. I'm trying to stay original but they will probably end up looking a lot like Dribbble's.

1263401348.0,ap64b,So you want to freelance? Here's a couple thoughts from a guy who used to freelance and now owns a company.,white_bread,349,46,117,"• You can try and market yourself to end clients like the local real estate agent, or whatever but in the long run you're much better off trying to find repeat business working for web development companies or ad agencies. Why? Because that dentist is an amateur will somehow find a way to drag a 2 week project out to 3 months. With these one-off sites you'll do so much more work for the same amount of money. If you freelance for an established company they will manage the client and they will manage you: you'll receive assets on time

• Develop a one page portfolio. People are busy. No one has time to figure out your site. Be grateful that someone read your email and clicked on your link. Everything they need to sum you up should be contained in that click. Name, and work examples. 

• If someone has an add for a full-time person do not send an emailing saying you'll work off site. This is a loser move.

• If you are not from the same location as your client make that clear. 

• Do not make me use a form to contact you. Use a normal email link. 

• Be clear about your hourly rate. If you don't, Flash, development it doesn't matter). If you don't know what to charge you don't have a lot of experience. In fact you don't have any at all. Currently I receive about 50 applications for an advertised $15 an hour job (you'll need to make 2x a salaried person). One third of the people who apply have a degree, a few examples of completed work, and are very in need of work. These people will also be slow when I pull them in and will take a couple months to understand how to build a billable product. So, if you are just getting started and know a few languages or can build a little Flash this does not mean you should expect a senior rate.

• Once you hash out your rate and the scope of the job from your client bill 50% down before you get started. This is totally common ESPECIALLY with new clients. many of the freelancers who work with me just drop an invoice at the end of the job because they know they're going to get paid. If there's no previous relationship then take care of business: it's your responsibility. 

• 80% of your work will come from 20% of your clients. So

• Pay you taxes. No really pay your taxes. You will slowly drive yourself into debt if you don't peal off 20% to 30% of your invoice and hand it to the IRS on a quarterly basis. If you don't have the discipline to do that then forget freelancing altogether. I'm dead serious about this. You are basically running a small business. Freelancing isn't just a cool way to work from home. It's hard work and you have to have your shit together. People will pay late. Your cash flow is going to be all over the place. Even if you get 80 bucks and hour for a job and feel like your getting somewhere you have to understand that you rate will be cut in half because you will NOT work for that same amount of time. Effectively you are making half of what you bill THEN you have to pay taxes on that and you need to get your own heath insurance.

Freelancing isn't something you do casually. You need your game face on 24/7. Work for companies not clients. Be clear on who you are and make that easy for people to see on your portfolio. Bill 50% down and stay on top of your taxes. 

Good luck.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive feedback. If you wanted to turn this into a casual IAMA I'm cool with that. 

ABOUT ME: I built my first site in '95. It was published in a couple magazines and a book. Later I freelanced with not a whole lot of experience but somehow managed to feed my wife and kids. After that I worked at a small digital ad shop. Finally I started my own business. I've hired a lot of full-time and freelance people and I've seen a million portfolios.

Here's the contract: [Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjnALucdNoEX4k2YdohPIgOZcpFXTVR70oYjqvw6Lj8/edit)

Please give me some advice here. I've had a terrible morning. Here's some background information:

I used to work for a very sketchy, I offered to make them a website for $1,950 under a contract. They agreed, signed the contract, and today was the due date. There was also a $585 deposit before I continued the work, which I received. 

Throughout the 3 weeks, who signed the contract, never attempted to try to set up a meeting -- and has never contacted me at all during this time. The main employee was the one arranging the website details. I've shown both employees the website numerous times and have attempted countless times to have them tell me everything they need to be put on there. One told me they loved it and that it was wonderful, the other one said it was great and that they'll send me more stuff to put on there soon. They made it very obvious that it wasn't a priority to them to do so. 

I finally received pictures LAST NIGHT to be put on the website, all layout, coding, and design is completed. 

This morning, and fuck you. I told him that the contract states he has up to two revisions where changes as far as content and pictures can be made, and he wouldn't let me talk. 

He continued to say, the contract doesn't mean anything, I want the deposit back."" 

**I said that AS THE CONTRACT STATES, is forfeited. He said he's going to take me to court. It even states in the contract that the client (himself) will pay all lawyer fees.** 

So this is really long but

He told me to ""get the fuck out and give him the deposit otherwise I'm taking you to court.""

So I left

------------------

[CLIENT]

This morning, you will pay [ME] in full for all of the work that they have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission her to make further design revisions."" To reinstate, at this point, you can either cancel this contract now or I can continue working on this site (up to two revisions) after I've received all content and necessary changes from you (all images, text, and certification information) through email, dropbox

In terms of the deposit, prior to completion of the project, the client observes any non-conformance with the art plan, the artist must be promptly notified, allowing for necessary corrections. Rejection of the completed project or cancellation during its execution will result in forfeiture of deposit and the possible billing for all additional labor or expenses to date."" Since you are unhappy with the new website, I will waive the second remaining payment that was due today if you wish to cancel the contract. The deposit of $585 is non-refundable, as the contract states. 

------------------------------


These people are terrifyingly moral-less and I regret doing business with them in the first place. But

**It also states in the contract:**

**""Client shall bear all costs

So I'm covered in case he tries to bring it to court



EDIT
----

I just got a call from one of the employees saying that they want to go through with the 2 revisions. He said that it's going to take hours of work and that he wants to sit with me to do it. I said that it clearly states in the contract that revisions are up to 10 minutes and only include text

How do I make sure that I can clearly identify two revisions so I fulfill my end of the contract? What power do I have to cancel a revision request? HOW DO I PROPERLY DISCUSS AND DO REVISIONS WITH A CRAZY PERSON?

I myself did some web design like 8 ~ 10 years ago and what i can see is that there changed a lot. Designs look much much better. I always started with Photoshop and from there I exported the design so I could edit the HTML. 

What I think, do you guys always start from scratch? Have you a library with snippets? 

Here are the following what I was curious about:

* How do you export from Photoshop? (if you use it)
* What program are you using for editing? (I have Coda 2)
* How do you write you CSS? (Do you start from scratch?)
* Do you have a lot of snippets? (I have some but not much)
* Which sites do you follow?
* Do you have other tips?

I'm aware there is another template/framework called boot metro

If you see a theme on wrapbootstrap that you like, but supporting the people that put a LOT of hard work and effort into their templates is totally worth the 15-20 bucks. Plus the free stuff doesn't come with support ;)

He said he was making edits and suddenly all that started showing on his website. I was confused trying to think of some weird glitch with his browser. 

Finally I do a screen share and ask him to show me.

I see his website then he starts to hit the back button on his browser which of course takes him to other pages he was on. He thought that was all his website still! 

I explained how the back button on his browser worked.  He obviously felt pretty silly but mostly because he just got busted looking at porn. He has a great sense of humor and can laugh at himself

Here's a JS hack that will append .ie10 to your html element so you can still target.

    &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;script&gt;if(/*@cc_on!@*/false){document.documentElement.className+=' ie10';}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

**Update for all the people wondering about the code I was using:**

Apparently it was caused by sizing things in rem's using [Snook's method](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem). According to Snook's logic

IE10 still doesn't render things like ""every other modern browser"" ([according to the IE dev team](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/07/06/html5-parsing-in-ie10.aspx)) but now it's almost impossible to cleanly target IE10 specifically without JS.

So I'll just be honest with everything. You can shit on me if you'd like. Help would be appreciated. 

So from a young age I was always very artistic. When college came around the only thing I knew I was good at and had an interest in was art/design. So I chose to go to a four year school for Graphic Design. I chose GD because that was what I was good at not necessarily b/c I loved it.  

I (not to brag) was always putting out the top designs in my classes. Unlike many other designers I had a natural talent to draw. 

Summer before senior year I got a job as the graphic designer at a very small start up tech company. I was so excited to get the job b/c I basically beat out anyone from my school who applied. I loved the job and felt important and was working there part time 20hrs a week while going to school my senior year. I even got to travel a bit. Made $15.50 an hour. And at the time it just felt like a lot. Lived in a house with my friends a nurse and engineer. I thought I was doing fine.

Company hit hard times. And always the first to go was design in marketing. Me. 

In the span of about 2 months. I lost my job

That was 3-4 months ago and it's a thing of the past. I've been talking to my friends more and more about salaries. And what I thought 40-50K a year would be a good salary isn't in there mind. 

The one's who are saying this are the nurse

So I've been applying to jobs... the few that are out there. I'm using craigslist mostly

I have my portfolio up on Behance and I am proud of it. I have like 7, and one of my projects was featured on a curated site. I look at some of my other peers from school landing jobs now and I'm just flabbergasted. Their portfolio's are so amateur that I'd be embarrassed to show them. They have maybe a hundred or so views, no comments, no awards. Anyways they are landing jobs some how. I'm happy for them and glad to! If they can get a nice job I should to right. 

I live in the Boston area btw. 

So I've been searching a few months now. In January I had an interview and did an assignment for them. They told me they'd get back to me but never did. 

Then I was contacted by a marketing agency to help with a new web product of theirs as a freelance graphic designer / contract work. I had no idea what the hell I was doing with all this freelance stuff. Anyways we had a couple meeting face to face. He put off our start date for a few weeks. I grew worried. He asked for my hourly wage and I said $25 an hour (something he asked before and told me he had a guy asking for $250 an hour.) Texted and emailed 3 separate times and no answer. Been over 2 weeks now and still nothing. Obviously I started looking for work again. It just really struck a nerve that this a$$hole could just blow me off like that. Even a simple email ""hey

So here I am dazed and confused. Now I'm starting to doubt if I chose the right career path. For the past couple years I KNEW Graphic Design was my thing. I wasn't pretending to be something I wasn't. I was artistic. I was creative. But now I'm just having so many doubts. 

It seems that before I went to college. GD was a career path on its own. Now when I'm job searching everything seems to be GD and Web Design. 

Now

I've read it enough on /r/web_design to know that a degree or certificate for Web Design is a waste of time. I was looking at ITT Tech or Northshore for classes and it looks like they cover the knowledge I would need to land many of these jobs that lump graphic design and web design together.


I feel like the only way I can make a good living doing design is if I become an Art Director

So I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I'm starting to feel like 4 years of GD was a waste. I should of just went to become an engineer or nurse or business major. 

Am I just getting discouraged from looking for work? 

Would I be happy if I just had a job and felt relevant again? 

Should I try out a temp agency like ""The Creative Group"" or ""Creative Circle""? Just to get my foot in the door

Am I being a whiny little bitch? 

I thought Web Developers paid well. Am I wrong? Should I try to get into that field?

How do you even become a UX/UI designer? Is it like being an Art Director where you get where you are from time and experience?

Should I try to get a certificate in Computer Science? Will that help me?

What the hell would you do in my shoes? 

Also PM me and I might share with you my portfolio. 

Wow


**EDIT** Wow you guys! The feedback I've been getting here at /r/web_design is amazing. I know you guys are all strangers on the internet but you are really helping someone out here. I just want you to know that. 

What I've learned:

- Networking!! I need to use a Guerrilla style approach. ""Visit offices and hand resumes and portfolios to important people

- Web Design is a solid career. Its always going to be there and growing as long as the internet is around. Work on Graphic Design (It's a good foundation to have.) while learning about web design in my spare time. 

- Don't give up. Being unemployed/laid off sucks! The economy is rough right now. Don't take it personally and keep working at it. It's just a tough time right now and I'll make it through. 

**EDIT #2** All I can say is I'm so humbled by everyone's passionate responses. I had no idea that so many of you have either been in my shoes or are currently in my shoes or can't even find your shoes.

I hope everyone is gaining some insight here and not just me. I'm reading all of your comments and still everyone is bringing something new to the conversation. 

I just checked out www.teamtreehouse.com and it looks like exactly what I should be doing with my spare time if I'm not working on my portfolio or networking. Also someone recommended I watch some of Micheal Locke's (UX/UI designer) videos. His sight has something similar for only $89 http://mlwebco.com/website-design-training/ and there is also Lynda.com.

What do you guys think about these sights? Do you have any others in mind? TreeHouse seems to be the best just from how professional and well thought out everything is on their end. 

Really everyone I can't thank you enough. Friggin' Reddit and /r/web_design. You guys are rockstars. 

**tl;dr** Graphic Design graduate. Trouble with the job search. Thinking of going back to school for get the knowledge for Web Design since so many of the job postings now just group the two together now.

I'm a reasonably successful developer but I want to improve my web design skills. Things I don't understand very well are all the little tricks people use to get certain layouts but I think I could learn these over time as they are in the same class as development difficulties.

However

 * Colour
 * Typography
 * Icons
 * Creating high-fidelity mockups
 * Layout (choosing good layouts

I want to create designs like say [this site](http://phoneify.com/)

Woke up this morning and found an email from one guy telling me someone is reselling one of my designs. He lists a couple of sites

193 results. 

...Its. Too. Early. For. This. :(

To make things worse, being that the occasional one isn't, I have to sort through each one to make sure I send the DMCAs correctly...

**Update:** One down. Yes

**Second Breakfast Update:** One of sites with the pirated design contacted me and demanded that I cancel the DMCA complaint, ""we paid for it already, not our fault its pirate"".

I was put on hold for upwards of half an hour

This week I was doing work for a client whose domain was hosted by GoDaddy. I suggested moving to HostingPad

Well they moved the domain...sort of. GoDaddy moved it on *one* of their 4 servers. to *one* of HostingPad's 2 servers. therefore
This was based on my IP Address. So on one of my laptops, I couldn't ever. After 3 or 4 calls over about 3 days, I finally sorted it out, and fixed it all.

I own and run [VlexoFree](http://vlexofree.com). Its a free web hosting service that has two plans to choose from. *Personal 300* which offers 300MB of space and 5GB of bandwidth; this plan is usually for small personal sites. And *Expert 2000* which offers 2GB of space and 20GB of bandwidth/month; a nice plan for big or business sites.

Heres a short list of basic features:

* [PHP 5.3.3](http://vlexofree.com/info.php) (I keep this up to date)
* MySQL 5.1 (with MySQLi)
* PostgreSQL
* Perl
* CGI
* Python 2.4
* Python 2.6
* Python 2.7
* Ruby on Rails
* [99% Uptime](http://www.pingdom.com/reports/s8tmf2n6m6go/check_overview/?name=VlexoFree)
* [Full List of Features Here](http://vlexofree.com/wiki/Features)

I do have a requirement for both the plans (sorry!). For the Personal 300 plan I require a linkback on all displayed pages. For the Expert 2000 plan I require the same as the personal plan plus an ad. Nothing is forced on your pages so you can choose where you want to put everything. I do this because I need to support my service somehow and I dont get enough donations to get rid of them.

I have an ad-free ($5/month) plan you can also choose. Compared to asmallorange.com you're getting a lot more for less.

I'm working for free every day on this service and I don't run VlexoFree for profit; I run it to give people who don't have money the opportunity to have a website. Due to that

If you don't need hosting please don't sign up for an account.

Ask me any questions you got.

I think thats everything you need to know.. [Feel free to sign up](http://vlexofree.com).

I've found loads of online blog posts etc. that list ""30 great free fonts"" and that kind of thing, Garamond, etc.

I have been googling for specific fonts, but there are some that I've not found any reasonable equivalents for.

So, then they will go on the list until something closer is found. Hopefully too, I can get some suggestions for both filling in holes in my list, and for perhaps new additions to the list. My goal is to amass as comprehensive a list of usable free fonts for general purpose design as I can.

One future option may be that if I sell a web design or logo using one of these free copies, which is very useful, but I feel bad about it and want to fix it.

Here is the list, please let me know!

I politely explain these are not minor changes and remind them about the sign off sheets and tell them the cost to make the changes.  She gets attitude and tells me nevermind to go ahead and launch as is.

My sister (designer) and I (developer) have been working on a tool to make it really easy for you (web designers) to offer a content management system to your clients. Basically you put HTML and CSS files into Dropbox and it turns those files into a Wordpress like content management system.

I've used a couple of different CMSs, more complex sites.

Now I'm helplessly trapped developing and supporting Business Catalyst sites

1. No server side logic at all. There are several exceptionally restrictive modules that can be barely manipulated with extreme perseverance and a willingness to spend huge amounts of time coding workarounds, cannot do MOST things required to create a professional website that adheres to a planned design. **If you want to display anything on your page conditionally, be prepared to spend many hours writing unique Javascript and manipulating modules to spit out data in hidden divs, class names and other stupid places.**
2. Support is terrible. Finding out how to do the most basic things is excruciating. Their help and documentation seems to be distributed across a bunch of different domains.
3. If you google for solutions to simple problems
4. Most of the other half of those results are questions on Adobe's own support forums that have been moved. Therefore
4. The provided modules (galleries
5. Tables. Everything is in tables. The modules consistently vomit tables onto your page
6. With all of the workarounds

With all of these things in mind, if not all of it, from the ground up. Even huge swathes of your CSS will break if you intend to use menus, forms or any module at all, because BC provides its own (usually unchangeable) class names and IDs. It could be helpful that some of the classes are called generic things like "".menu"", but often you'll realise those classes already exist and are in use in other parts of your site...

This extremely simple functionality is impossible:

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;{left content}&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt; This is static text
         &lt;div&gt;{right content}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

If you absolutely must have a website but you can't afford professional quality and you did an IT class or two in highschool

So here's my story. I normally work in web design, and he gives me clients sometimes. I have been doing this for about two years. I've never fired a client before (and I've also never wanted to fire a client this badly before).

Last year

After meeting up with her and talking to her

So I talked to her and assured her that her needs did not require the use of an Access database. We agreed to use Google Forms in Google Drive, add new questions, and what the different question types entailed. Simple enough.

This is where the shit hit the fan, asking me to help her recover the survey because she accidentally deleted it, and - worst of all - bothering me with questions about using alternatives.

Now, I am answering emails left and right about whether or not she should be using paid alternatives. I told her that free is always good, and her needs did not require the use of anything more complicated than Google Forms. 

Long story short, she emails me saying that the alternative she picked was way harder to use than Google Forms and she is thinking about switching back. She also tells me that the deadline has passed and she needs to make a decision.

I am not about to hold her hand while she asks me more questions about making the transition back to Google Forms. I look in my inbox and realize that I have answered probably in the ballpark of **100** emails about the surveys and have not been paid since the initial time we met up. So I fired her. I replied to her email and said that I have clients who a) pay me and b) listen to the advice I give

tl;dr - I fired a client who was extremely high maintenance and wanted 24/7 help without paying for it. I wasn't charging her for emails because I usually don't

So my questions to reddit are (had to edit formatting here): Have you ever had to fire a client? What was the final straw? How did you handle it? Have you ever charged for time when it comes to excess amounts of emails?Do you think firing my client was justified?

Let me know what you think. Like I said above


**Edit:** I still have received no word from the former client. But, and I will implement the use of contracts in further design projects.

The script is a free script the previous developer found on this site: http://www.webtutoriaux.com/compteur-visiteurs.html

The site looks relatively clean and even trustworthy to some extent.

The script to add looks trivial:

     &lt;script src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/services/compteur_page.php?client=301&amp;Af=4""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

If you open the link in a browser

    document.write('&lt;IMAGES OF NUMBERS&gt;'); document.write('');

So far so good

Anyway, where I am not. I understand the classic concept well enough (users upload code to a central server). I also understand that Git uses a more flexible method that can model Subversion/CVS but can also use a more complex hierarchy. 

I work with two other developers (both less advanced than myself). We've all worked together for more than 2 years

_Tools we use:_

* Windows 7 to develop on (not my choice)
* Netbeans IDE (my coworkers)
* Sublime Text 2 (myself)

_Things I've done:_

* Made a github account
* Installed a Git plugin into Sublime Text
* Installed Git EXE to the default directory (I don't understand the implications of this)

_Things I think I understand but don't know how to do:_

* I would like to push all changes to a network drive

_Things I have questions about:_

* Do repositories only handle code? What about non-code resources

This is a throwaway account because there's no way I'd post this hideous info on my real account. I'm a disaster waiting to happen. Oh, so this is my attempt at trying to rectify that. Website gets hacked? Tough shit, that was our only copy.

Consider a site that has a shop.  The user adds things to their ""basket""

A link to the basket page is part of the navigation.  Now

1. ""Your basket""
2. ""My basket""
3. ""Basket""

In option (1), ""my settings"", ""cancel my order"", and so on.

How does one decide between these options?

Some sites choose inconsistently.  An example that sticks out is on sites where, ""Hi James!  (I'm not James)"", where the parenthesized section is a link to log in as a different user.  The first section is the service speaking to the user, and the second is the user speaking to the service.  To me, it sounds weird.

In general it seems like choosers of option (2) must necessarily be inconsistent because writing the whole site text in the form of option (2) would be absurd.  ""Your server is down for maintenance, must be of the option (1) form.

Can we identify a clear class of places where option (2) is appropriate while surrounded by other a majority of text of type (1)?  The prime candidate is a link which is an action: the user is speaking to the server, we also get form submit buttons with the phrase ""place your order"", which sounds less weird to me than I thought it might.

For the same reason
