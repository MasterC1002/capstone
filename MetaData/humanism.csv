Your mod /u/Iamducky sent me a PM asking that I make sure this community was aware of a message I posted in /r/atheism regarding our annual humanitarian relief drive for Doctors Without Borders.  The information is below...

Doctors Without Borders has a message filmed by its director in the USA yesterday specifically to thank our community (read: nonreligious redditors

Two years ago,000 in 2011, we have banded together to raise more than $210,000 for MSF.

Why Doctors Without Borders?  It is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning international aid organization that explicitly steers clear of religious and political affiliation.  It has been a clear consensus choice for a charity drive in the past when the question has been asked, everyone knows other people do good work and we will never reach unanimity on - well, pretty much anything.  But, for those interested, MSF staff would also like to make themselves available some time in the next few weeks for an /r/atheism -hosted AMA.  If you have very specific questions about MSF, please look at that when it happens.  (I can meanwhile answer any looming questions about the campaign, either on reddit or on email at rDennyCrane@yahoo.com)

This year, to reduce the overhead in our processing by 67%.  In fact, CrowdTilt waives all fees taken in by this campaign, with the only cost being the processing of a credit card.  So if you decide the mood hits you and you'd like to make a donation to the continued campaign, **[please follow this link to donate](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/atheism).**

I know a lot of you weren't subscribed to /r/atheism in the past, substantiated by the nonreligious specifically to band together and make a difference in a way that theists use religious-affiliated organizations to do so.  It's the end of the year, a time where people tend to reflect with friends and family, and we hope to continue to make a difference with this campaign.

In fact

I would love to see this continue

While it is often debated whether or not Obama is an atheist or not (Mainly in Conservative circles), am aware that at this time no openly atheist politician could become President in this country.  And so I lean to the side that feels that he ""pretends"" to be Christian and uses pieces of scripture for analogy and empathy with most of the country.  So when I listened to this speech, I found myself feeling something was different.  There was the normal God Bless America and scripture quotes, but there was something truly non-religious about his appeal to America. 

Starts at 13:18
&gt;You know, start with a simple question.
&gt;Why are we here? What gives our life meaning? What gives our acts purpose?
&gt;We know our time on this Earth is fleeting. We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped. We know that, no matter how good our intentions, we’ll all stumble sometimes in some way.
&gt;We’ll make mistakes, so often unable to discern God’s heavenly plans.
&gt;There’s only one thing we can be sure of, for each other. The warmth of a small child’s embrace, that is true.
&gt;The memories we have of them, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves and binds us to something larger, we know that’s what matters. - **Barack Obama**

Am I the only one who sees pure humanism?  It reads almost word for word as an existential definition of humanity,"" in a way that is interchangeable with fate, but I see this as again, just the painting of humanism with God tossed in for his audience.  That line ""There's only one thing we can be sure of..."" just breathes non-belief, we can't be sure of God's existence or good will or divine plan, we can't rely on heaven above to lead us to the promised land, we must do it alone.  This is not the Christian narrative of obedience, love

Am I alone in this line of thinking?  Am I twisting this speech too far?

Hello everyone! It's me again, meaning we're ***just $350 away***! 

Also, he'll match it](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/115mar/my_student_group_at_a_religious_school_in_the/c6jjazv)!

Presbyterian College is a small, we have only 1300 undergraduates. We're one of the smallest (if not *the* smallest) Division I school.

As a result of this (and the whole church-affiliated college bit), is extremely small. Yet here we are, currently the top-raising SSA affiliate for Light the Night, with the potential to be one of the top-raising LtN groups *in our region*. This would be **huge** for the secular groups in our area, as they'd get a ton of publicity for this.

After all: a secular group in the Bible Belt? At a church-affiliated college?! Raising a ton money to beat cancer?!? You can bet that this would be a huge media event

But it's not only that; this is more personal. Most of us have in some way been touched by some form of cancer. I lost my grandfather to bone cancer, my grandmother has now been cancer-free for several months. 

This is why we fight. There is no good cancer, the Stiefel family has graciously offered to match donations up to $500,000, for $1,000,000 total. It'd be silly not to take advantage of it.

So that's that. If you'd like to donate

My question to humanism is how big is the movement and what is it doing (and how can I help) to help diminish the fighting that is going on with homophobia and misogyny. These two seem to be of equal greatest importance and even have great similarities

There is a library near where I work where various groups often set up informational displays as part of an outreach program staffed by a few people.  All sorts of groups use the time and space but two notable to me were Mormons and Muslims. 

They all have very good material available for passers by to pick up and read up on later. The material is well designed and well presented (and of course full of nonsense :)). Every time I pass them I think about how I would love to make similar materials available that promote Humanism in the same way.

I've registered a domain and have started trying to figure out how to create a custom Wordpress theme. I have found a decent plugin that I think would help to make the Download Area work. This will be challenging for me as I don't have a lot of experience in this but I am pretty sure I can pull something together.

That said, pamphlets, etc. covering a range of topics from Humanism FAQs, history, famous Humanists, Humanist contributions' etc.

Consider this a plea to any creative Humanists out there who might be willing to contribute. Be it writing or design

Ideally I would love to have this end up being a crowd-sourced repository with a rating/tagging system in multiple languages

I know there's only a few of us at the moment but I took the liberty of starting a [r/DebateAHumanist](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAHumanist/) subreddit because I think that in time it will be needed. Feel free to add it to your frontpage or start a topic.

I know that r/humanism is sparsely populated but it has grown quite rapidly (approximately doubled) in the past couple of months or so since I've joined. Basically my suggestion to make it better is for people to simply have more input. Nobody likes a stale community so I've been trying to put in relevant links that I've found in BHA newsletters etc.

If some frequenters to this reddit could do similarly for other Humanist associations or other secularism groups from around the world as well as any interesting links they come across from their own interests; philosophy, education et.c. then please don't hesitate to do so.

I hope to see you in the comments section with your suggestions/contributions. Thanks",self,t5_2qjpn,False,,human,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/humanism/comments/kbx11/suggestions_for_rhumanism/

I am a feminist.

I believe in egalitarian relationships and marriages.

I support same-sex marriage. (The Baptist church in the city of Clinton

I am vehemently against the death penalty.

I do not interpret the Bible literally; it is full of symbolic language. Not only that

I do not believe in a literal heaven and hell. In a tiny nutshell, a spiritual darkness. You deny the poor and oppressed, you are going to experience a hell. We've all experienced hell. Heaven is the opposite. You speak for those who have no voice, you promote equality, you feed the poor, help the oppressed, you will experience a spiritual wholeness

God is love. I believe not that God has love or is made of love

Religious diversity makes us all stronger

I believe in science. 

I do not support prayer in public schools.

I believe coexistence is essential. 

I am against war.

I believe in government social welfare programs.

I believe sin is anything that dehumanizes a person

I believe the Bible to contain insight to the nature of God, rather than the literal ""word of God."" 

I believe God is everything I listed above. I see God everywhere I see love, joy, rest. 

Iit is my duty as a Christian to love the people in the world with the same selfless

I've arrived at my positions not by being lax in my faith as many conservative Christians would accuse me of, by digging deeper into the Bible, opening my eyes and ears to the voice and sight of God in the world as manifested through acts of compassion and words of love. It is my duty as a Christian to see that no one is starving, that no one lacks a roof over his or her head, that no one is lonely, that no one is denied equality because of gender or race or sexual orientation or religion, that no one is ever again feels oppressed

*That* is what it means to be a Christian. Not converting people over and condemning people who do not adhere to Biblical laws (which, and then chose to ignore what he says two lines down which is for women to not wear makeup and jewelry and to cover their heads). 

Christianity is about love. And God is love.

My friends I would normally call and discuss deep philosophy with are not available... so i figured I would look to the internet for advice and discussion.

So I was raised a Christian and later in life became an atheist.  I studied other religions all through school and learned a lot from their profits and parables on how you should treat others.

I am now running into a problem now of being to caring and to helpful. To where it either puts people off or I get massively used.

This use to not bother me because well... I guess I never really thought about it.  

But now I'm getting ""older"" (26) and getting tired of the same thing over and over.

I don't want to stop caring and I don't want to detach myself from people. But how do you guys deal with everyone always coming to you for help?

1354856740.0,14fg5d,A few questions whose answers I wanted from your perspectives and viewpoints.,XeroInfinity,5,1,9,"Hello!

I'm a Muslim who believes that religion is something personal and spiritual, a person can have no religion and still have morals.

I recently got into a open discussion for fun with a Muslim friend about morality and religion. He argued that it's nearly impossible to prove morality using reason and logic alone

I on the other hand argued that some things in morality are universal and do need a religious justification. Examples include murder, etc. Regardless of whether you follow a religion or not, whether you believe in a God(s) or not, EVERYONE will agree that such things are wrong.

He however argued back that secular humanism and all other related ideologies, people from certain societies, empires, and civilizations raped, murdered, and pillaged never thinking it was really wrong. So isn't religion a source of morality?

And for the sake of discussion and Devil's Advocacy

I replied explaining that his questions themselves were somewhat fallacious in nature,' and that anyone can do anything as long as he or she isn't infringing on someone else or physically or mentally harming them.
He asked me why is the line there? How can you use reason and logic to prove that the line exists there?

So basically

* **1.) Why does the line for actions stand at 'Do what you want as long as you aren't harming others or infringing upon them?'**

* **2.) How do you prove this line exists here and is right using logic and reasoning?**

* **3.) In that case

Just to be clear, but it can confirm morality, he argues that without it, morality cannot be reasonably or logically proved.

With that, and the reason and logic behind moral philosophy myself. Thank you!",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,

http://i.imgur.com/cqOZ8.jpg


	I have beef with the above picture. And I've seen it enough times that it's going to bug me if I don't talk about. First lets make an assumption about the picture, Canadian, or other women in a more or less secular society. When I refer to the Woman in the Hijab I am talking about women in Saudi Arabia or any country were Islam (or any religion really) is enshrined in the law. I don't think it's  that big a leap. Now, on to my beef.
	So one can see that each woman pities the other
	The first thing is something I normally don't get too vocal about because people who aren't me usually get pretty vocal about it first, which is kind of what this cartoon implies. I understand that a cartoon has to punchy and clever, but would it kill the cartoonist to draw a moderate figure in the back ground? Would that destroy the message of the cartoon?
	Now then, but none the less she can do it if she wants to. The woman in the hijab cannot go home and put on her with out facing serious trouble from the authorities, at least in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Here is the meat of my beef.  I am not going to pretend that the woman in the bikini doesn't have to deal with some elements of a     greatly weakened patriarchy, but the woman in the hijab has elements of fairly healthy patriarchy enshrined in law in two countries that I know of.  Also, the woman in the Bikini can drive a car if she wants, unlike women in Saudi Arabia. So this is not simply a matter of perspective. It's a matter of the role that legally enshrined cultural and religious taboos play in shaping the lives of women (and men, but they aren't in this cartoon) in a given society. 
	Finally I am aware that some countries have banned the wearing of face coverings when getting government I.D, and I think Holland has or is debating something similar. Canada forces people to take off face coverings when taking the oath of citizenship. The French and Belgian (and maybe Dutch) laws are against overt religious symbols so you can't wear you're giant rosary in a public place either, but you can do what ever you want in your private life, and a government asking that your face be uncovered for an identification card is really not unreasonable.

This being the place it is, ""Thank goodness for Christianity. Sort of.""
Now, humanity is not a religious concept. Certain organizations, clubs, families, and individuals make it their mission to propagate kindness.
But many--particularly in this neck of the woods--are drilled by their religion into believing that you should almost reflexively help when someone needs it, sharing the love of God in action, or whatever.
My question: Can humanity (a society, whatever), through some institution (school, maybe, but not chuch), instill in people the habit of being nice and helpful as a reflex? I'm not talking about altruism in general; it's simple enough to join a group that does good things, such as Red Cross or United Way.

It no doubt offers a cruel irony in the form of Black Friday

﻿However, but each holiday can be a meaningful celebration with an intelligent and thoughtful interpretation. The presence of the 90% that Sturgeon's Law dictates obscures, but doesn't obliterate the potential quality 10% that remains. It's tempting to dismiss holidays out of hand, as perhaps meaningless superstition further corrupted by rabid consumerism.

Though the 90% of Thanksgiving is the most readily visible, or the momentarily pardoned gluttony of the Thanksgiving meal, for those willing to search for it, the 10% is there, at the very core of the concept of Thanksgiving. The core purpose of Thanksgiving is, as the name would seem to indicate, to be an occasion to give thanks for the many gifts of fortune we all possess, great Carl Sagan:

&gt;*Every cell is a triumph of natural selection, a multitude. Within us is a little universe.*

﻿Like all good messages, in its purest form, a time to recognize what is really important, and to face the great truth that all things, great and small, are only temporary, and knowing this

So this Thanksgiving, an overview of some of the things I'm most thankful for.

**I'm thankful for my existence.** I'm not thanking anyone in particular for this (except perhaps my biological parents, and how amazing it is to even exist at all, to be able to write these words.  
﻿**I'm thankful for my friends**, ""without friends, no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods."" That the human is a social animal is certainly a fact. Where a single person may falter, friends provide the inspiration to carry on in worthy endeavors.  
**I'm thankful for humanity in general.** Though, the potential for good is in all of us, if only we allow it to manifest itself. And to once again quote Carl Sagan:

&gt;*The cosmos is also within us. We're made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.﻿*

﻿**I'm thankful for the Internet.** ﻿It may seem strange in a list consisting largely of abstract ideas, much of the world is connected through a system that allows information to traverse the entire globe in a matter of minutes or even seconds. The ubiquity of access to this amazing compendium of knowledge from all across the world has played a key role in the formation of my worldview and in my growth as a human being.  
**I'm thankful for books.** Libraries were the original Internet. In the words of Carl Sagan, is one of my major idols:

&gt;*What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.*

**I'm thankful for language itself.** Be it in books, or anything else, language is a mechanism by which an idea is transferred from one mind to another. Effective communication vanquishes ignorance, questions assumptions, and can even change the world. Edward Bulwer-Lytton was right to state that ""beneath the rule of men entirely great / The pen is mightier than the sword.""  
And finally, without requiring any supernatural beliefs, affirms the inherent dignity of every human being. Humanism recognizes the dual potential for both good and evil in every person, and realizes the importance of striving for the good, lest the evil take root and rule our lives. And my Humanism, though it's arguable whether this is true for Humanism in general, is accepting of other beliefs. So long as a belief does no harm

&gt;*If a human disagrees with you

The works of Chris Stedman and others have helped me to realize that Humanists must reach across the divide and work with like-minded religious people to make a difference and recognize our common humanity. And that's what Humanism is all about.

~

**[The Charter for Compassion](http://charterforcompassion.org/the-charter/#charter-for-compassion)**

**The principle of compassion** lies at the heart of all religious, to dethrone ourselves from the centre of our world and put another there, and to honour the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.

**It is also necessary** in both public and private life to refrain consistently and empathically from inflicting pain. To act or speak violently out of spite, to impoverish, exploit or deny basic rights to anybody, and to incite hatred by denigrating others - even our enemies - is a denial of our common humanity. We acknowledge that we have failed to live compassionately and that some have even increased the sum of human misery in the name of religion.

**We therefore call upon all men and women** ~ to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion ~ to return to the ancient principle that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, even those regarded as enemies.

**We urgently need** to make compassion a clear, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensible to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.",,False,t5_2qjpn,True

I apologize to you on behalf of my Christian sisters and brothers if you have ever felt judged or condemned because you do not share the same views as them. Such judgment and hostility is entirely unchristian. I love the people in your community

And... historically-rooted contemporary Baptists and humanists probably have more in common than one would think: belief in science (imagine that!), knowledge of historical contexts in which the Bible was written, freedom of thought, use of reason, and an understanding that humanity is on a slow journey to discover the truth using reason and intellect (and add for us, prayer).

This review is for: [The Good Book: A Humanist Bible (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Book-Humanist-Bible/dp/0802717373/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp)

----------------------------------------------------

I bought this book with no expectations. I had read an article about it

This book is not a compilation of work. You will not open it up and find passages from various works called out by author. It is truly written in the style of the Bible - Grayling has taken the collected wisdom of hundreds of secular philosophers and melded it together in the flowery prose form typical of the Bible. There is no reference list at the back to tell you where anything came from

The Good Book begins with Genesis, but saying the things I believed! I didn't realize how much I would enjoy hearing Darwin's theory of evolution told as a beautiful story of how we began and the cycle of life.

As you make your way though the book, introduced without preamble, just snippets of conversation or story which attempt to showcase an idea. There are passages on grief and death as well.

If you are looking to learn the works of these philosophers in an intellectual way, there really is something cathartic about having grief and death and moving on with life written in this way.

I feel in some ways as an Atheist this may have been what I was missing and didn't realize it. I didn't have anything to help me find a way to feel good about my place in nature's greater story, I'm by no means an expert, but I have read some of these works and they are by no means easy to absorb.

So, it is a great work. ",,False,self,t5_2qjpn,False,,

A lifespan is strictly less than 120 years. The best approach to life is to think. The best way to think is to learn. The best way to learn is to question.

To learn is to improve your cognitive framework. Your cognitive framework is your mental self. Your mental self is who's reading this: you.

Before humans developed language as a way to reproduce concepts, who told someone who told someone who taught my computer science course.

You should learn algorithms. That's what thought is: a sequence of well-defined steps. A procedure operating over a list should be able to handle an empty list.

Humanism seems to seek to give people tools to think about things objectively

However I find myself often considering Buddhist philosophies in the context of humanism because in my mind they tend to seek to eliminate the root causes of human suffering

In turn this suffering causes more suffering usually through some sort of desire, it should be based on ""Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion"", and ""a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible fulfilment"" (paragraphs 7 and 9 respectively), but I have yet to hear it addressed?

How do you personally deal with this ""rift""? Are individuals left without guidance to deal with these problems? I understand that there isn't one ""dogma""/solution for this problem, of desire etc. 

*Amsterdam Declaration*


Amsterdam Declaration 2002

Humanism is the outcome of a long tradition of free thought that has inspired many of the world's great thinkers and creative artists and gave rise to science itself.

The fundamentals of modern Humanism are as follows:

Humanism is ethical. It affirms the worth

Humanism is rational. It seeks to use science creatively

Humanism supports democracy and human rights. Humanism aims at the fullest possible development of every human being. It holds that democracy and human development are matters of right. The principles of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human relationships and are not restricted to methods of government.

Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility. Humanism ventures to build a world on the idea of the free person responsible to society

Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for an alternative to dogmatic religion. The world's major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for all time

Humanism values artistic creativity and imagination and recognises the transforming power of art. Humanism affirms the importance of literature

Humanism is a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible fulfilment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living and offers an ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges of our times. Humanism can be a way of life for everyone everywhere.
Our primary task is to make human beings aware in the simplest terms of what Humanism can mean to them and what it commits them to. By utilising free inquiry
