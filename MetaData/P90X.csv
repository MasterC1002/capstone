1338226386.0,u8yad,So you want to start p90x ? Potentially helpful hints and ramblings of a p90x advocate. (Long Read),p90x_throwaway,142,14,46,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Doctor

Started p90x in 2011 and have completed 1 full cycyle in addition to various modified cycles. At my heaviest I was up to 192lbs in 2011 and currently weigh around 164lbs. Grew up very active playing a variety of sports including football/weight lifting

**Intro TL:DR Played sports when young

The most important thing I want you to take away from this write up is learning how to **MODIFY**. I am talking about modifying the exercises, calories, and recover/rest and pretty much anything else you can think of. We will touch on Modifying throughout.

**Expectations:**
What should you expect from the p90x program?

•P90x is not easy

•P90x actors are more than likely in better shape than you and have already completed the program at least once. They will do more reps than you and you shouldn’t feel bad

•P90x requires a real commitment of working out 60-90 minutes 6 days a week and is a serious fitness program.

•P90x will get you into shape and give you a solid base for doing other things (running

•P90x is not a super

•P90x will typically not get you super ripped in 1 round (especially if you need to lose more than 15 lbs

•P90x should be accompanied by the supplied diet plan or your own Modified diet that follows similar guidelines. Example increased protein

•P90x will probably take more than 90 days to complete with real life events

•For the Love of God listen to Tony Horton

**Equipment**

Ok so now that you know what to expect and want to start need to make sure you have the right equipment. P90x does not require a ton of equipment and if you have the following equipment you will be good to go. 

•Resistance Bands and or Dumb Bells (Typically Ranging from 10-40lbs)

•A Chair 

•I highly recommend a pull-up bar even though you can modify using a band in the top of a door frame. 

•Yoga mat 

**Workouts**
Ok now that you are ready to put the DVD in and get ripped, Tony’s advice and the program in general.  During this week I would use the pause button as much as needed and watch the actors and Tony to ensure your form is proper and/or which modified form of the exercise you feel most comfortable with.

After the practice week follow the program starting from day 1 and “Do your best and forget the rest”. That means keep hitting play and keeping working hard during the workouts. If you get winded and need to hit the pause button, then modify to another exercise you have learned and keep working hard. 

**Plyometrics:** This thing is a beast and is great interval training. Be prepared to have problems using stairs the next day

**Kenpo X:** This is kind of like a kick boxing/cardio workout. I have seen a lot of people complaining about this workout in this subreddit and I don’t quite get it. Maybe my martial arts background helps me with the form but if you are truly putting forth the effort this is a good workout. The only advice I could offer would be to make sure you are using your legs and torso to pivot during the punching. Also when you punch you should be engaging your core, if you insist on subbing it out I would recommend at least a 5mile run at 9-10 minute pace, or 45 minutes of moderatly intense jump rope.

**Yoga X:** I hate it

**Resistance Workouts:** All of the resistance workouts are pretty self-explanatory and I have included a quick note that Tony covers multiple times during the workouts.

**Muscle/Body Preference**

*Bigger*: Use heavier weights so that you can feel the burn around rep 6 and you struggle to complete 8-9

*Lean*: Use less weight and complete 12-15 reps

**DIET**

p90x diet info from Reddit User Amulcent

&gt;""The official P90X nutrition guide spells out a diet consisting of consuming foods from the top tiers of michi's ladder in three different macro nutritional phases that changes ever 30 days.""

**Phase 1** - Fat Shredder - 50P/25C/25F The first 30 days of the official P90X diet you are advised to consume calories in a ratio of 50% protein, 25% carbs, and 25% fat. 

**Phase 2** - Energy Booster - 40P/40C/20F Days 31 - 60 of the official P90X diet changes the macro ratio to prevent a plateau. The increased carbs are recommended with the phase 2 workouts as they do get more difficult with addition of Chest

**Phase 3** - Endurance Maximizer - 30P/50C/20F - Days 61 - 90 of the official P90X diet will again alter the macro ratio to prevent a plateau. This is a muscle building diet

**My Thoughts and Current Diet**

I am not going to tell anyone what they should eat but I will provide my information and let you use that as a starting point. I am a 30+ male who has an office job who started the program at 185+, gluten and processed sugars among other things. I try to stay near Phase 1 for the entire workout and modify depending on how my workouts go.

Everybody is different and their bodies react differently

**Conclusion:**

I absolutely love p90x and with some creativity and planning you can modify it to meet almost any physical goal you want to accomplish. Maybe after this 8 week program I will post some pictures

http://imgur.com/a/837K7

I gotta say, kick me into shape!  I turn 30 next month, i've never had my abs like this before, definitely the best shape of my life.

Some info and how I did the program:

After about week 2-3, gave up on it.  I decided to do something else that day - so instead I did some running.  Usually a 5K on my lunch break on the treadmill (it was winter).  Other than that, i didn't stray too far from the routine.  Sometimes instead of Kenpo I did Core Synergistics.  I was in pretty good shape at day 1, i have a gym membership and usually went there on my lunch breaks, doing my own usually routines 4 days a week.  So starting P90X still gave me a swift kick because it was something new to start.  Week 1 brought in some soreness (ESPECIALLY my abs) - but it didn't last too long, you work through it.

Diet:
cut out all sodas
breakfast was either oatmeal with natural peanut butter &amp; whey protein
lunch was deli meats
dinners was usually meats/veggies/pasta

I would always have a whey protein shake or recovery shake when finishing the workouts.

I used Optimum Nutrition multi-vitamins (Opti-Men)

[After Plyo X](http://imgur.com/Fs0yrDq)

* So just a brief recap: I started a year ago at around 215-220 very very overweight. I had already done some running but was looking to get really fit. Also

**Round 1** So I did one round of P90X straight up with no modifications and lost a decent amount of weight. 

**Round 2** My second round was another P90X but instead of doing Yoga X I did P90X2 Yoga X because it was a bit shorter. I ended up loosing more weight and getting down to about 170-169

**Round 3** My third round was a P90X - P90X2 - Insanity - 1 on 1's Hybrid with a focus on putting on some muscle mass. To accomplish this I started eating 3000 calories a day instead of the 2400 and put on about 5 lbs. The before and after pictures from this round saw some pretty big muscle gains. I stopped looking so scrawny and started looking a little more built.

**Round 4** This round was about cutting off some of the fat I picked up in Round 3. My goal was to cut down from 175 back to 170, P90X2, 1 on 1's, Insanity, Body Beast Hybrid.

**Round 5** This round was back to putting on some muscle. Im currently 6 weeks in and so far have gone from about 169 to 176 while keeping my body fat somewhere around 8-8.5%. It's kinda hard to be accurate about it. This round was pretty much just a Body Beast, 1 on 1's hybrid.

Today was day 90, and I'm looking forward to it.

Day 1 I couldn't do two pushups in a row, from sissy 3kg dumbbells to 15kg ones.


I've lost 35 pounds

I've stuck to a 40% carbs, no cheatdays, just days where my ratios weren't spoton ( and some where they were really bizarre )

I have missed a few workouts but have made sure to not miss any liftdays.

And here comes the pictures!

So I started on March 28th. Yesterday was 90 days from the start. I didn't miss a single regular workout but went pretty easy on some of the recovery weeks. First recovery week I only did 1 day of Yoga and 1 day of Kenpo as I was on vacation. I went running, biking that week instead. Second recovery week I did 1 of each activity (Yoga, Kenpo, Core Syn) and went running that week. Final recovery week I skipped most as I have been out running and surfing quite a bit.

I did not miss or skip a single regular workout though. I kept through every workout start to finish with only a few pauses here or there. 

I have been fairly active though in addition to P90X. Ran a 10km official race, etc.

Did not follow the nutrition plan at all. Just ate healthy (as best I could anyways. No fast food

I am not entirely sure of weight loss

I am new to protein shakes

I increased my pullups from Max 3 to Max 25-30 (depending on the type). I can get through all 349 moves in Ab Ripper no problem. Plyometrics I have never really had an issue with but I can make it through that easily now.

Not related to P90X directly

Not sure what else to put in here! Just happy to be done! Had an awesome time doing it. I made two attempts at it over the last couple years (first time getting to day 50

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/wlVVv#0)

I'm 26 and 6'

Started in January of this year weighing 282lbs and incredibly out of shape. After the first round I was down to 227 for a 55lbs loss. Stuck mostly to P90x but never was a fan of the Yoga. Maybe did it 6 times. Usually swapped it with Kenpo or Insanity. I'll do it occasionally on a Sunday now if I feel like I need a good stretch. Also towards the end I would swap out Kenpo with an insanity workout. Usually Pure Cardio or Plyo.

I was very happy with my results so for the second round decided to do a P90x/Insanity hybrid. It was absolutely miserable at first and only got worse the 2nd month when the Max workouts started. Stuck with it and am currently down to 201lbs. Missed a week during the 2nd round due to vacation but I did Insanity workouts and ran while on vacation. 

Going forward I plan to do another round of the P90x/Insanity hybrid then move on to P90x2 and give it a go. I would ideally like to get down to the 180lb range. Weight loss has become a struggle now but I'm still losing inches so I'm not terribly worried about that.

I didn't follow the nutrition guide. I just cut calories and made sure I ate a lot of protein. For the first found I ate around 1500-1700 on any given day. Second round I bumped it up to 1800-2000 per day. For supplements I used Shaklee energizing soy protein

Edit: He's some more info on my diet:
Wake up 4:45am Drink a energizing soy protein shake

Workout then afterwards have a recovery shake

9:30 snack: Granola bar of some sort. Nature valley usually

Lunch: Turkey or ham sandwhich w/ cheese and some pretzels

4PM snack: Chobani Yogurt and banana

Dinner: usually whatever I want as long as its under 600 calories

Before bed: Protein shake

STARTING OUT

I thought I'd share what I've learned from completing the first phase of P90X

I started out in decent shape (40 pushups, I don't like gyms and wanted something I could setup at home; two, I usually prefer running, but my current living situation doesn't allow for it anymore; and three, I wanted a flexible-yet-structured program and someone to tell me what to do.  For me, these considerations made the DVDs, gear, and eating habit changes worthwhile.

I'm now 3 days into Phase 2, ""What have you been doing?!? You're so CUT now!""  I'm not someone who's ever been big and bulky...I've usually been the skinny guy...but P90X is changing that, even after Phase 1.

Below I'll lay out the gear, and thoughts on exercises I've accumulated up to this point.  While I'm obviously not done with the program yet, I consider what I've done so far a complete success. I put a lot of time into researching the program ahead to increase the chance that I'd see it through, and that knowledge, which I'm sharing here, seems to be paying off.

I’m including prices, if you buy quality and you’re committed to the idea of a fitter lifestyle beyond just 90 days, you’ll save money in the long run (at least compared to a gym membership and personal trainers…and possibly health costs).   Plus, most of the gear you buy won’t be obsolete in 3-5 years like a computer would be.

Last note before everything else…I bought most of my gear and supplements through Amazon.  If you’re a student

GEAR

One can obviously drop a lot of cash on every aspect of P90X, was more middle-of-the-road; that is, I wanted to buy quality equipment that would last long after the program and be relevant for other uses, but I didn’t want to break the bank, either.  Here’s what I use, and I thoroughly recommend everything listed here:

P90X DVDS

PowerBlock Personal Trainer Adjustable 2.5 to 50-Pounds per Dumbbell Set, but these blocks are easy to store, easy to use, and not at all awkward for exercises in P90X.  I suspect I’ll get rid of these after Round 1 and get the larger set.  For now, however, these are perfect for someone who can do, say

Manduka BlackMat PRO Yoga Mat, after a couple wipe-downs, not slippery.  A good mat is important not just for yoga, but also for stretching in Kenpo, X Stretch, and doing Ab Ripper X.  Get a cheap mat if you only want it for 90 days.  Get a more expensive one if you want to use it after the program.

Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar - Extreme Edition, but I think they’d be tough on the P90X bar—no big deal.  Definitely a good place to save money.

Altus Athletic Push-Up Stands

Harbinger 143 Men's Pro FlexClosure Wash &amp; Dry Gloves, well made, and washable.

3” Yoga Blocks (2)

Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester

Sundesa Blenderbottle with Blenderball, and/or glutamine supplements.

Tribest Mason Jar Single Serving Blender PB350 - BPA FREE, top off with skim milk).  Just drink from the glass. Big time saver, insanely easy to clean (20 second rinse under hot water).  Didn’t want to buy another gadget, but can’t recommend this enough.  Shake plus a banana is breakfast (even though it goes over the fruit limit a bit).

SUPPLEMENTS

Lots of pills in this section—big honkin’ pills.  If you can’t swallow big pills

100% Whey Protein - Gold Standard

Endurox R4 (4.63 lbs), and definitely something I look forward to when I finish.  This is shopped as a recovery drink and has that 4:1 carb/protein ratio that’s proven to help you bounce back.  Def. a decent option.  I know lots of people swear by chocolate milk, but milk just doesn’t sound appealing to me after a big workout.  Also, I have this usually 4-5 times a week—lifting days, plyo, and sometimes Kenpo or Yoga.  As with all supplements, I try and conserve them if I can.

Clif Builder's Variety Pack 18 - Bars (9 chocolate, very comparable (yet cheaper) replacement for the P90X bars.  Taste great and are perfect on the go.  I’ve been eating one at work between breakfast and lunch.  Really, really like these, and they get cheaper ($17ish) if you subscribe to them on Amazon.

Opti-Men Multivitamin 180 tabs

Optimum Nutrition - Creatine, but great if looking for size and/or maximum results.  Safely increases muscle cell size (with water) and allows for greater nutrient absorption.  I’m cycling this, 2 months on, 1 month off.  

Optimum Nutrition - Glutamine, but proven to quicken recovery.  I mix this in with recovery drink.  

Nature Made Organic Flaxseed Oil 1, but a great way to round out essential fatty acids.  And pretty darn cheap.  Morning pill with multi.

Kirkland Signature Fish Oil w/ Omega-3 Enteric Coated 180 Softgels, I still take this at night (w/ second multi), just in case.

Jack3d, which is maybe 1-2 times per week.  Some people like it for every workout, but I’d rather conserve.

So I guess a bit about myself for those who dont know, I was 205 ish, but at that point I was already down from roughly 220 by running. My first round of P90X was straight up, no substitutions, no skipped days, ate perfectly clean and DID MY YOGA AND KEMPO!! The only difference between my first and second round was I switched the P90X2 Yoga out for P90X Yoga. The third round, which I just finished was a hybrid of a bunch of programs with focus on increasing strength through caloric surplus. If any of you guys care I can post my workout schedule.

He hosted the workout inside our indoor practice field so weights were not involved.  The workout was essentially a hybrid of Legs/Back, and many players also participated which was surprising since it was the off season.

Male
Haven't done a real exercise since highschool gym class
First time with the P90X


So I started the video with a huge grin on my face, along with ab ripper x. The warm up itself was a little tiring, but I thought to myself ""Meh...this isn't so hard...I wonder why people think it's so bad"". 

Then the work out started

I tried my best to keep up with the people in the video. I pushed myself as much as I could with every pushup, etc... But I just couldn't keep up with any of them. It was disheartening. I thought screw it, I'll just start jogging or something instead. So I turned off the video and went upstairs. That's when I walked along the mirror by my living room and saw myself. Sweating, out of breath, red in the face, and giving up. Every memory I ever had of being called fat ass, fat fuck, bitch tits came back to me. Every memory of being too scared to ask out a girl because I was too fat for her

That's when I said fuck it, but it doesn't matter. I tried. And that's all I can do. I might not be pushing out 20 diamond pushups or 20 reverse chinups, but it doesn't matter. I'll get there eventually, and I just have to keep trying. 

I woke up this morning with the most sore body I've had in years

Just thought I'd share my first day. Hopefully I can share my day 90 pics with you guys and look as great as all of you :)

1341440224.0,w1tls,I've been doing P90X for two years.  Here is my experience and advice for anyone doing P90X.  ,BLB99,54,11,17,"I’ve been doing P90X for quite a while now.  I’m not sure how many rounds I’ve technically done and I have only ever made it to the full 90 day mark twice.  I’m a PhD student

A little information about me, but where I want to get some really big strength and muscle gains I think compound lifts at the gym are probably more suited for what I’m looking for.  You can definitely gain muscle with P90X, but it is more tailored towards overall body fitness and losing weight.  But I love P90X! And I’m going to miss it.  It is so nice to be able to wake up and push play on your DVD player and workout rather than go the gym.  Here is my advice. 

First, so I would have to pause the DVD and switch weights manually and it sucked! I got tired of switching weights, so sometimes I would just use the weight from the previous exercise for the one I was currently doing.  Not a good idea.  I wish I would have had the Selecttech weights from the beginning.

Second, staple them all together, and write the date above each workout when you’re finished.  This way you won’t get confused if you do multiple rounds.  I wish I could go back and look at my sheets from the very first time I did P90X and see how far I’ve come.  

Third, but it was really hard, so I would just do the same weight and get 8 reps the next time I tried and this was a mistake.  Always up the weight when you reach your max reps. 

Fourth, and yoga.  When I do pushups I start with the bars and go for as long as I can.  When I can’t do anymore I drop to my knees and still use the bars.  When I can’t do any more of those I lose the bars, so I’m just doing pushups on my knees.   I was watching an interview with Tony recently and he suggested never go to your knees.  He said to just stay in the regular pushup position and just go down far enough so you can get back up.  I haven’t played around with this much, but it sounds like a good option.   When it comes to pull-ups I wish I would have been utilizing negative pull-ups the whole time, but unfortunately I’ve only incorporated them in the last year.  I’ve never really had much of a problem with pull-ups, but I’ve gotten a lot better at them.  I start out by doing as many as I can with regular form.  When I can’t do those anymore I switch to negatives.  When I can’t do those anymore I start using the chair.  I talked my sister into doing P90X and she tried the yoga video and then called me and said “yeah I started doing it, but I couldn’t really do what they were doing, so you would think I would be flexible. Wrong.  I’m not at all and I still modify the shit out of yoga.  

Fifth, it has significantly helped my running.  I’ve frequently suffered knee pain due to having a really tight IT band and nothing has helped this more than doing yoga.

Sixth, but you aren’t losing as much as you would like I would recommend re-evaluating your diet.  Just doing P90X should be enough.  When I stopped consistently running I bought a heavy bag (which is really fun and an awesome workout) and started using it on my cardio days as well.  It took the strain off my legs, but again I was burning too many calories.  Now I use my heavy bag on my kempo days and it has really added to that workout and makes it really fun.  

Seventh, but for me trying to gain weight and strength I was never eating enough calories.  I have always been really reluctant to count calories, because I thought it was hard and is sounded like being in prison to me.  But with the My Fitness Pal app it is really easy.  Six months ago I started making sure that I’m eating 3500-4000 calories a day and holy shit is it a different world for me now.  I’m starting see some really crazy gains and really gaining weight!  I was just never eating enough calories and burning way too many calories, especially when adding the additional workouts.  Sure I was healthy and in “good shape,” but I was never able to add as much muscle and strength as I would have liked.  I can only imagine where I would be today if I would have started counting my calories and ensuring I was taking in enough calories when I began P90X two years ago.

That is my experience and advice for doing P90X.  I’m not a fitness guru or the zen master of P90X or anything.  I’d say I’m in good shape, but thanks for reading! And remember to BRING IT!

tl;dr:  First, always be cognizant about how much weight/pull-ups/pushups you did last time and always try to increase.  Fourth, modify!  Fifth, just like Tony says “Don’t neglect your yoga!”  Sixth, I would not recommend running frequently while doing P90X.  Seventh, and the most important.  Diet is everything.

Quick Background - 24 year old, a p90x/1-on-1 hybrid and some heavy lifting at the gym trying to add mass.

I injured my neck back in October 2011 lifting too heavy and having improper form on some moves. This lead to a complete halt in my efforts to get fit until I started X2- I completely stopped working out and started eating fast food and junk again just about everyday if not multiple times a day.

I started P90X2 Jan. 2 and Finished March 30th. Day 1 I started at 11.75% body fat and by day 90 I was at 8.40%. I actually only lost .6 lbs. I started at 155.8 and finished at 155.2. Here are the measurements:

Chest: Day1: 34.75' Day 90: 36.5'

Waist (at navel): Day 1: 31.5 Day 90: 30.25

Right Arm mid bicep(not flexing): Day1: 12.75 Day 90: 12.25

Hips(At widest point): Day 1: 39' Day90: 37.25'

Right Thigh: Day1: 20.75 Day90: 21.5

Right Calf: Day1: 14.25' Day 90: 14.5

Diet: My goal wasn't to lose weight, but I kept adjusting my calories slightly each week until I got it right which happened around week 8 which ended up being around 2100 calories (not including post workout shake). I practically ate the same thing everyday, it wasn't fun after awhile, but it was the easiest and cheapest way to do it. A typical day looks like this; Breakfast - 2 cups of cheerios, 1 cup of berries, almonds and a protein shake. AM snack - 3/4 cup of egg whites and 1/2 whole wheat bagel. Lunch - 4oz low sodium turkey, 2 slices of whole wheat bread

I really enjoyed P90X2. It is absolutely terrific for sports performance which the whole program is based upon and the 3rd phases is all about with the new PAP workouts. Unfortunately, but I really enjoy doing the new one and plan to started doing it at least twice a week from now on.

Edit: Had a few questions about my diet and the routine. (Probably should have included this in the first place). Figured it would be easier to post them here. First

As far as my diet, at the bottom of my intake range. I switched this during phase 2 and 3 as well. Currently, I am back in stage 2 because I've lost quite a bit of weight. I tracked my diet every single day with the MyFitnessPal app. and while the workouts definitely boosted my overall strength I feel the alteration in my diet had just as big of an impact. 

Here is an interesting thread that I have used for calculating how many calories you can cut as well without cutting into muscle weight. http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iynws/are_you_a_beginner_who_wants_to_lose_weight_wants/

1345793115.0,yqs3h,Do Kenpo X properly!,zrodion,48,10,22,"There are a lot of people here complaining that Kenpo X is too easy for them and they don't feel the workout. Yet nobody seems to wonder how come Tony and all the crew behind him are sweating and panting. There really can be only two conclusions: either you are much more fit than they are or you are dogging it.

For those who don't consider themselves superior to Tony I recommend paying closer attention to how you do Kenpo. It is one of the easiest workouts to do half-assed. In Plyo you jump a lot and so you are bound to elevate your heart rate even if you aren't trying very hard. In Kenpo you have to drive yourself to high HR. Notice how Tony checks everyones heart monitors at one point in Kenpo.

Kenpo X is really intense for me. But yesterday I decided to make an experiment and focused on doing just the minimum amount of movements required for it to look like video. And it really was much easier and I didn't even drink that much water. 

Here is my top tip: don't focus on how to make the movements similar to video

Flex your muscles. Don't throw your arms out, jump instead of stepping into the hits. Kick higher, move your whole body more, do the jumps with Tony during the breaks.

For this round I did P90x lifting 3 days a week and follow a 10k running program on cardio days. Next round I will probably continue running (working up to a half marathon in April and Tough Mudder in August) till it gets too cold and then I'll probably switch back to doing P90x and insanity for cardio days. After this round I'm planning on trying P90x2

I had to use my laptop webcam for the pics for days 0, and because of the crappy camera reacting horribly to almost any kind of lighting, I had to use a different backdrop for each set of pictures. For day 90, I had a friend take the pictures for me on my phone, which has a much better camera. The last picture in day 90 is just me doing some weird pose my friend made me do that hurt my pec. 


Advice to beginners: Just keep pressing play. You don't really need to eat exactly what the nutrition plan tells you to eat, keep pressing play and do your best, but listen to your body. If your knees hurt during plyo or legs &amp; back, then just chill out for that day, maybe substitute the cardio video or yoga instead. As I gained the ability to do a lot of pushups, my wrists began to hurt, but I solved that by getting bars. I would definitely recommend pushup bars.


Some beginning/ending stats:

Weight: 185/161

Waist: 37in/31in

Bodyfat: ~24%/~14%

Bench Press (for 8 reps min): Probably below 100 lbs/135 lbs

Bicep Curl (dumbell

Vertical Leap: Could not reach a 9 foot ceiling/can graze a 10 foot ceiling.

Ok. Today is day 90! I have literally just finished the final Yoga about half an hour ago

**Starting stats**: height 5'10""

**Final stats**: weight 155 lbs

**Supplements**:

 * P90X recovery drink
 * Wheybolic Extreme 60 per recommendation of the GNC guy ([link](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3509954))
 * P90X multivitamin (started slacking off in phase 2)
 * Think Thin protein bars (they have 230 cals and 20g protein


What went right:

 * Exercises: I really did ""bring it"" in all exercises. Throughout phases 1 and 2
 * Nutrition: I stuck to the nutrition guide really well. I have  not eaten a SINGLE pizza slice or burger or drank a coke in the past 90 days. I felt myself slacking off in phase 3. It is much harder to stick to the nutrition plan when you go out
 * Keeping track: I kept track of everything! How many reps i did of everything. What I ate every single day... etc. I also kept track on my white board of how far I am into the program and how every day is going. This really kept me motivated all the time.

What went wrong:

 * Injury: I had an injury in day 45 which kept me out for 20 days. It started as a minor injury
 * Photos: I didn't take good enough photos before starting. It was just the one photo you see above
 * Nutrition guide: I realized too late that the nutrition guide really suggests too much food for my case. I should have stuck with around 2000 cal a day. 2400 was a lot more than I needed.
 * BRINGING IT: I made a mistake in phase 1 and 2 that I didn't realize until phase 3. I always kept the videos playing and played along. So, take a break, crank a couple more, he'd be done. I stop too. In phase 3, I learned that this is no good, so I started pausing the DVD over and over whenever I felt tired, so i can reach my goal. This was what really made it for me. I saw the numbers really going up in phase 3 because of this trick. When I do another run

What's next:
 
I am gonna take 3 or 4 days off, icecream, you name it!) then I am gonna start P90X2! It has already arrived, and I can't wait to start! Look out for my day 180 results teehehe.

Not too many pictures

For those of you who are curious
I got rid of all the junk (pop, ice cream) and only had 2 ice creams and 2 cookies the entire 90 days. 
I cut back my dairy intake by a significant amount and only had one glass of skim milk every dinner. 
I consumed A LOT more protein than normal and had a protein shake everyday (no I didn't purchase the ones from p90x. Simply bought a protein powder). Also

I started the program weighing in at 171lbs and now weigh approximately 157lbs.

Here's mostly what I ate:

**Breakfast:**  

- 1/2-1 cup egg white

- 2 glasses of water

- Whole wheat toast

**Snack ~10:00am:**

- Broccoli

- Some turkey or chicken

- More water

**Lunch:**

- Chicken or turkey sandwich with lettuce and carrots (the odd time fish)

- Coconut Greek yogurt

- Banana

- Water

**Snack ~2:30:**

- A little bit more turkey or chicken

- Soy beans

- Apple

- Water

**Dinner:**

- Was subject to a lot of things such as spaghetti, random pasta with meat (make sure pasta is whole wheat) and then the odd time pizza, wings or burgers

- Sometimes brown rice

- Veggies!!

- Skim milk

**Night snack:**

- Soy beans

- Protein shake after workout

My dinner wasn't always the best option because I'm at home for the summer with my parents and I get off work to come home and eat what's available. For the most part though try I tried to choose meat and fish.

I go back to school at the end of August and I won't be continuing p90x however

1- IT FEELS AMAZING
Seriously

2- You get it out of the day

3- You'll feel alert &amp; energetic. (seriously

Cons:

1- Lose sleep

How to:
1- Drink a cup of water before bed
2- Put your tomorrow workout clothes by your bed
3- Put a water bottle next to your bed
4- Set your alarm
5- Be in bed at 10! (even so I manage to not sleep until 11:30 somehow)

Now
Drink some water
Get dressed
Work out

Now this is the perfect way

I asked /r/P90X two months ago if it was a good idea to switch from P90 to P90X after only 45 days (before P90 phase 2) and I decided to give it a shot! 



Finally it was the best idea I ever had! I did not lose as much weight as I wished (10lbs in 45 P90X Days and 16lbs in 45 P90 days) but I have seen my belly to get more flat and I feel a lot more fit in general but after all

Every time someone posts in this subreddit asking how to gain mass with P90X the top comment is usually how the poster should change to a program like Starting Strength and many of you people all upvote it.

Look I have nothing against Starting Strength, I will let Kai Greene explain why this is not what you want for mass gain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8wZNGL4iA4).  A better recommendation would be any of the routines freely offered at [bodybuilding.com](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/forumdisplay.php?f=8). I like [The Kris Gethin DTP MASS Trainer videos](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=146947923)

Of course that is not what the posters are requesting.  [It is possible to gain mass with the right diet](http://teamripped.com/my-nutritionsupplements/my-bulking-diet) and a modified P90X routine and we should be answering that question with a link like this one: http://howdoigetfit.com/how-do-i-get-fit-post/p90x-and-gaining-mass-beyond-p90x-classic/

If you really feel its necessary for the poster to perform a totally different program I think that the best choice would be **[Body Beast](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/body-beast-workout.do)** since it is a Beachbody DVD based program just like P90X that is dedicated to hypertrophy and requires almost all the same equipment as P90X.  Dumbbells, barbells, squat racks, and benches if they don't have to just for the pleasure of doing Starting Strength.

/endrant

**TL;DR - Recommend [this](http://howdoigetfit.com/how-do-i-get-fit-post/p90x-and-gaining-mass-beyond-p90x-classic/) to posters asking how to gain mass with P90X.  Maybe tell them about [this other beachbody program](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/body-beast-workout.do) but don't recommend a power lifting program not dedicated to hypertrophy like Starting Strength since it is a poor choice that requires a gym membership or a ton of money and space for the equipment.**",,t5_2rmaw,1348561291.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/10fw8e/psa_stop_recommending_starting_strength_for/

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/1gkhrs/progress_so_far_through_day_67/

Overall I am happy. My diet still needs work and I finally have been starting to make better choices overall. I never had a horrible diet

I ended up losing inches but not weight. Partially because of diet. I did lose 3% body fat so I am now 24% body fat which is awesome. Here are inches lost

* Chest 0.5 inches
* Breasts 2.5 inches
* Waist 1 inch
* Hips 1 inch
* Biceps .75 inches
* Thighs 1 inch

One thing I would highly recommend is a pull up assist band. I was doing chair assist then negatives and I just didn't feel like I was getting the right work out. I got the pull up assist bands off amazon and it was absolutely amazing. I didn't get those until the end of this round so I am guessing the results are going to be quite different next time around.
Other random things


*  I didn't do kenpo
*  I am like a million percent stronger and feel much better
*  I think I have abs again!
*  I started subbing in ab ripper 2 (I think it's easier) to change things up near the end of phase 3. I just needed a change.
*  I plan on using this week to try out P90x2. I don't know if I'm ready but I am not sure if I can take another round of P90x without a break

Pretty much everyone hates plyo. A lot. There is a post by me in there somewhere as well (granted that I have been posting a lot lately). Last week, and it came time for me to do it again today.

I made it all the way through.

How did I go about doing this

Allow me to create a bulletted list for you

* As is said all of the time, which you probably are unable at this point. There is absolutely no shame in that. Find your own speed for each exercise and go. You don't have to match them because, quite frankly, they are in a lot better shape than any of us beginners (more than likely).
* Do **NOT** feel like you need to do every set for the full amount of time. Someone on this board gave me that advice and it worked beautifully. Say a set is 30 seconds long. Some sets that focus on moves that I am currently struggle with got knocked down to 20 seconds for me. I told myself that that was my goal. Occasionally I surpassed it, modify, modify. Speaking of which...
* **MODIFY!!!!!!** See Pam the Blam right there? **[redacted with apologies]** The female on the right. Watch her. She is giving you modified moves to do in case some of the moves are too intense/too high impact for you at this point. I used some of those modified moves. When I used them, and that is fine.
* Just to reiterate a point that Tony makes constantly
* This one was probably the most important one for me. Pause the video. It is okay to do that. I tried to pause as little as possible during the actual exercise


I am probably forgetting something, modify frequently as needed, and you will be able to make it through. More than anything, you have a fantastic morale boost afterwards. Next week, I am going to go for 25 seconds instead of 30 in some areas, and I'm going to try to modify less moves. My goal is to be able to do the whole thing as I enter phase II. This DOESN'T mean I want to keep up with them just yet. I just want to be able to make it through without any pauses.

Today was my cheat day so I figured 'screw it' I'm going to have a real cheat day for once (instead of just having a tiny bag of chips or something). For lunch I decided to have a Whopper and damn! Not only did it taste awesome (eating limited salt/fat then going to a Whopper... Glorious) but it actually made me feel 'full'.  I felt full all afternoon too.  That's never happened before.  

I'm 66 days into my first cycle of p90x and even 2 months ago I'd have eaten that Whopper

Then tonight I went out for beers with a buddy.  Normally I'd drink all night without even getting buzzed.  But tonight, my head is swimming.

Holy damn.  

I finished Pint #3 and I was done.  My total bill for the night? $15 after tip.  WTF!? (Normally it'd be around double that or more... often with barely a buzz to show for it).

In August of 11, fat bastard, not a stitch of muscle).  By December of 11 I was at 200 lbs, but my BMI had dropped to 28.5.  So, LOTS of new muscle, lost some fat (but probably gained some from quitting smoking).  My routine was a 3 times/week 30 min light cardio followed by strength training (bars, bells, etc…)  Basic stuff

Fast forward a year, a week later, we’re off to the races!  I always wanted to do P90x and this was my chance.  If we do it together, we’re more likely to finish. Here are my thoughts so far:

**Day One**:  Chest and Back - Can’t do one unassisted pullup anymore (could do 1 in 2011) but was knocking out 12 per set of each type using a chair, but couldn’t do ANY of the Abs.  LITERALLY couldn’t do one sit up, I was so blown. Drank a protein shake and went to bed.  DOMS not bad, just tired as hell, arms are a bit sore today, more than yesterday.  Core is nice and tender, so while I couldn’t do Abs, not muscles.  So, and struggling at 7-8.  I need to drop weight and go light to burn fat.  Will worry about Muscle on Round 2).

**Day Two**:  Plyometrics - Yesterday was a WHOLE different story.  I’m thinking to myself, no problem.  I got strong legs, used to squat 185 lbs. in the gym.  Not an issue.  Did some research on it, watched some YouTube vids of people doing it. Plyo seemed like it wouldn’t be that hard.  I don’t know what all the fuss is about….

NOPE!  OMG, not just at night!  I made the call (after my wife collapsed on the sofa with a “NOPE!” 10 minutes earlier) that I’d stop.  I’m SOOO glad I stopped.  I couldn’t take it today if I hadn’t quit.  It hurts to poo man, IT HURTS TO POO!!!  I can’t stand up without assistance.  The walk to work was MURDER!  WOW that was intense.  Had no idea it would be that bad.  I have nothing else to say about yesterday besides, OUCH!!!  Maybe I should have had a protein shake again?  It’s mostly Cardio, so I didn’t think to drink one.  Just went and ate a HUGE taco salad (huge being a TON of lettuce, light cheese, ¼ cup homemade Guacamole, so that’s good.  Misery loves company as they say.


Tonight, bad for weight loss.  I’m thinking about dropping it to 20 lbs.  And as little as 8 if there are Lats. involved (my neck gets wrecked by lats. if it’s over 10 lbs.).

On the bright side

Gonna stick with the program and make it happen!  Get home

Beachbody programs in general

My first round of P90X was classic, and would sometimes substitute Insanity workouts for Kenpo, and sometimes I would do an additional Insanity workout after a resistance workout. 

My second round of P90X was a hybrid of insanity. I replaced ab ripper x for cardio/insane abs, and kenpo for pure/max cardio. 

As far as diet goes, and also drank alcohol 1-2 times per week on average. 

Supplements:
During my first round, CLA, and green tea. I also took OxyElitePro in the mornings.
In my second round, took Jack3d before workouts, sometimes BCAAs, and creatine as well.

Taking pictures is crucial to noticing your results. Just looking in the mirror

I am currently recovering from a dislocated shoulder at the gym. I am hoping to start another round, I'm hoping to do Insanity, and then Asylum. I probably sound like a BeachBody junkie, but after dislocating my shoulder at the gym, I realized how much I prefer working out at home.

I just finished designing a ""custom"" hybrid for myself to bulk up. 
I basically took out all of the cardio

When you go to the Beachbody link provided below, and easy on the printer ink. The file they want you to print is a jpg with horrible compression. Sure, you can use it, but it's bad. I've warned you.

Now what I've done is taken their program, and then Acrobat Pro to make them usable! The printing is clear, you can write in the spaces easier (yeah, it's still small; had to compromise somewhere), and it's easier on your ink. The only hybrid program I didn't fix was the One on One hybrid. I don't own that program so it's of no use for me. If you want me to do it, ask nicely, I'm sure I can.

Little background info: I was a fatty. No, I haven't cared. I haven't wanted to change myself because if I didn't care, why should anyone else? I'd get called names here and there from my brother, and some friends who would be joking around with me, but I always was hurt by it. But I never wanted to do anything about it. I'm fine the way I am, and they're just cruel human beings. I was never popular with the girls (I wonder why) and always just assumed it was because girls were shallow, and they should want me for my personality (haha!). Then it happened. I met a girl. We fell in love. It was perfect. She loved me for who I was and not my body, and she can't be with me any more. Who knows

Life is different. Suddenly I'm aware of how my man boobs poke out through my clothes. How wide my waistline is. How all of my clothes are incredibly baggy. How much I hated looking in the mirror and how every time I would walk by one I would look away. I despised looking at facebook photos with me in them because I absolutely hated the way I looked. I was so sick of myself that I couldn't take it any more. I looked at weight loss tips online, and nothing seemed to peak my interest. Then a friend of mine mentioned the P90X. ""P....90.....?"" I remember asking my friend. And he gave me his workout set up, advice on how to get started, and off I went. 

I cleaned my kitchen from junk food. The bbq chips, pepsi, everything. I put them in a bag and gave them to my friends to split amongst themselves (waste of food to throw away haha). I bought new running shoes, new bands, new weights, a yoga mat, and I hit play.

First day wasn't so bad. I can do this. Man, I wanted to give up. I stopped the video. Said fuck it, went to my room to get changed, and opened my dresser drawer and saw a note my ex girlfriend had written me previously. I won't tell you guys what it said, but it left me in tears. Not because of what it said, but at how hurt she had left me. That was the push I needed. That ignited my heart man, the catalyst I needed to really become someone new. I ripped it up, and hit play. 

I still remember laying on the floor after plyometrics. I was in pain. My legs hurt, and I mean nothing, hurt more than the heartache I was feeling. Every day I would hit play. Every god damn day was a struggle. Every day I would lay in my bed after a workout, too sore to move, and just have the tears roll down my face. 

Let me just say this now guys (and girls). For anyone thinking of giving up, and tears. Only if you're willing to sacrifice those will you be able to achieve the body you want. 

I'm 2 months in. I've hit play 60 times. I couldn't be happier. I feel better, and I can't tell you how different my life is. I'm wearing clothes that I never thought I'd fit into, I'm dancing in clubs with my friends, I have women approach me and flirt with me, I've gone on more dates in the past month than I have in my entire life all together. But nothing feels better than looking in that mirror and loving the person that looks back. That man that I would avoid just looks back at me now and has the biggest smile across his face. 

I have 30 days left, giving up, quitting, you're only cheating yourself. This program isn't easy, but man oh man is it worth it. Whether you're trying to bulk up or lose weight, you're going to love who you are at the end, but only if you try your best. 

That's my little story. Just thought I'd put it out there. Perhaps I'll drop in again after my 90 days are up and post my before and after pics. But until then. I'm going to keep hitting play. I hate it...but I love it.

Here's a roundup of my experience with P90X.  I started the program for the first time about two years ago and had to stop at week 8 due to an unrelated injury.  In that time I went from 175lbs to 160lbs


I finally got my motivation back in a big way earlier this spring.  Started up again at 167lbs on April 3rd and made it through about day 75 before some unavoidable obligations and travel plans forced me to take a few weeks off.


I was ready to start phase 3 over and finish strong, so I gleefully made the decision to stop this round early and start again from day 1 with her at my side.


As such

Starting weight 167lbs.  Current weight 155lbs.

I've done the program a couple times (each a little different). First time I didn't do the diet. Second time I didn't do the workouts everyday (my schedule was crazy at the time). Third time I did it the way it's suppose to be. 

So

The Workout

* Do yoga. As much as so many people hate it, keep at it. You'll notice huge changes in 6 weeks, and you'll be glad you powered through.
* Quality over quantity. Tony says it all the time
* Don't be afraid to press pause. Don't do it a lot. But if you need to

The Diet

* Do the diet. It really makes a difference in your body shape. Almost everyone who has completed the program will agree.
* String Cheese: put it in the microwave for 20 seconds. It tastes better melted and you get rid of some of the oil. Win-win.
* If you can
* Egg Whites: Don't get Egg Beaters. Get a carton of Egg Whites. Actually

Random

* Get the bands so if you end up traveling
* Drink a lot of water throughout the day. It's good for you!

Since starting the program, I feel more confident, and every aspect of my fitness has improved dramatically. I've had a series of physicals for my new job, so I also got to see my blood pressure drop sharply and my resting heart rate has also slowed. My scale weight has stayed pretty much the same, but my body fat is disappearing.

First thing you need is a chair.  Bring the chair up to slightly behind (or in front) of the pullup bar.  Stand up on it and instead of doing a pullup set your palms facing you to do a chinup on the bar.  Grab hold of the bar in that fashion and let yourself down as slowly as you can after taking your feet off the chair.  Wait a few seconds and do it again.  We are not pulling up

When you are able to fully control the descent switch to the normal pullup grip.  If you are having trouble with your grip you may either way to try some chalk (cheap to get) or some hand straps (also cheap to get).  I recommend chalk unless you have a weak grip.  If you have a weak grip you can fill up two 5 gallon buckets with water and just hold them for as long as you can once per day going for more time each time.

When you can control your descent on the pullup you are ready to try your first true pullup.  You may find you can only do one to three.  That's ok.  If you can only do one,,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,True

(I didn't take any back pics on Day 1

Finished Day 90 this morning! I'm happy with my results, but I didn't change my eating habits that much, besides eating more often. (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner.) So my results were not as dramatic as they could/should have been. 

I'm also a bad P90X-er and never took the fit test at the beginning, but I went from being able to do 0 wide-front pullups to being able to do 5, which was pretty cool.

Overall

A quick summary of what I thought of each workout:

* Chest &amp; Back: A good workout
* Plyometrics: I have a weird love/hate relationship with Plyo. I felt like puking during it
* Shoulders &amp; Arms: Another favorite workout. Lots of variety and no pullups!
* Yoga X: Glad it was included, and much more basic (but not easy!)
* Legs &amp; Back: My least favorite workout because it was really hard. Soooo many pullups
* Kenpo X: I fell in love, but during Phase 3 I tried hard to really push myself during Kenpo and it got fun again.
* Core Synergystics: I wish someone had warned me that this workout is tough. I thought that since it takes place during the recovery week it would be easy
* Chest
* Back &amp; Biceps: Katie. Someone shut her up. My biceps felt like they were going to explode by the end.
* X-Stretch: I did X-Stretch about 75% of the time
* Ab Ripper X: Then_He_Said's recommendation to pause and make sure I did 25 reps of each exercise completely transformed my Ab Ripper X experience. I made gains much more quickly, though, and I collapsed in pain at the end of the Mason Twists every time.

I'm going to throw my opinion out on the matter: I think that ab ripper x before your non-ab routine is a bad idea. 

Here's why:

First

While constructing it this way

Second, pushups, or using the bands will impact your form. You utilize your core for a lot of these exercises as it is. After a hardcore ab workout like ab ripper x, your effectiveness will decrease. 

You don't use your core as much on the non-ab routines

I recently moved back in with my family after having a motorcycle accident last year and decided I wanted to use this opportunity to get into the best shape I have ever been. I have always lived a fairly active lifestyle (hunting, nor have I built any mass. 6 foot at about 130 lbs. I can do push-ups and pull ups but I cannot keep up with the pace they set in the video. Even doing the whole first day with knee push ups and band pull ups I was only able to get through about 40 minute of it before I had to call it quits.

I am not quite discouraged that I failed. But it seems that even doing the modified version of all those things I was still not able to complete it. I got P90X for free from my brother who got it for his birthday

Breakfast: Shakeology with water and 2 ice cubes blended
Snack: P90X Protein Bar
Lunch: Salad with 7-8 oz of deli meat and fat free Ranch Dressing

I've generally been a member of the ""Kenpo is lame"" club. Coming from much more intense conditioning programs, but the intensity was low compared to the lifting workouts and plyo. Moving at Tony and ""the kids"" pace just wasn't doing it for me, even doing kicks at eye level, plenty of footwork along with the punches, and bringing it for each punch.

Then, 2.5 lbs each. Wore them for the whole workout, and it was night and day. Took them off for the vertical punches at the end, and felt like I was in DBZ, my fists were moving so fast. I felt good and trashed at the end of the workout, and much more motivated to do Kenpo X again in the future!

Just do a search on amazon for ""hand weights"" or ""wrist weights"" for various options, sword/hammer, etc with them on. I've also got some ankle weights I found, but I'm not using them yet, since there's more potential for joint injury and overstretching hammies if you're not careful.

Yeah, tendon and ligament damage, etc...Much much higher. But if you have good form, ease into it, and want to make Kenpo a lot more intense, this is one way to do it!",,,,

I am happy with my results but I know that I could have done a little better.  The reason I say that is because I did have some times where I was not as strict on my diet as I was in the first month.  Even though I have had nutrition downfalls

Training Block#3 Adjustments

1. Nutrition - Fat Shredder to Energy Booster Diet - I am going to up my calories from 2

2. Increase water intake - I don't think I was drinking enough water and I have made it a big point to start drinking more water at least 64oz/day and that's on the low side for me now.

3. Utilize my BodyBugg - When I started on my fitness journey I bought a BodyBugg that came with a free 6 month subscription.  When it ran out I didn't bother using it.  I want to get the best results possible so I will be paying just for a month of the web service.  It's $10 but I think it will be well worth it because it keeps me accountable and I like seeing what calories I burn and at what times of the day.  It also has made me more active in walking around during the day at work.

Well after the TLDR here are the progress photos.  I have noticed that my right bicep looks bigger than my left bicep or maybe I just suck at flexing it.  Anyone have any recommendations on how to fight this problem?

Height - 6' 2''

Weight day 90 - 154

Stuck pretty rigidly to the workouts, not 6 but this tended to be a game of squash or badminton on my rest day. 

Diet - I don't think I did one meal that was specified in the guide. I simply looked at the foods and distribution of carbs and proteins then did it myself through whatever I had. I stuck to a really low calorie intake of around 1200 calories with approximately a split of 40% protein, mainly because I am lazy, were egg white omelets, typically with a meat filling, special K or similar, Protein shakes (whey protein - around 8LB over the course of the program) and lots of grilled chicken. 

I realise in hindsight that if I had eaten a bit more when I should have I would likely have had more energy to build bigger muscles

Losing that much off of my waist has been challenging too. Now nothing fits. Truly a first world problem. Then again

**My motivation:**

I wanted to be in charge of my body. Before p90x, concentration, energy levels, my job. I won't give Tony Horton all the credit in the world for any of that, because frankly, it was me who had to work my ass off for 90 days, but the Tonyisms certainly helped. p90x is a good starter program, I may consider joining a gym to actually build muscle in a way that you cannot with this program.

I don't know if my results are anything special. Frankly

Lots of room for progress though! 


Two other small notes:

1. I got a ton of those shorts at a stall in Mong Kok. Probably US$20 for seven pairs. That's why I have a different pair for each progress photo

2. I have no idea why I look progressively more tan as the shots go on. Maybe the confidence got me going outside more!",,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/12ik2i/my_90_day_progress/

Upper Body Progress: http://i.imgur.com/g42TP.jpg

Back Progress: http://i.imgur.com/V1Bhy.jpg

**Me:**

Age: 20

Height: 6'1 ft

St. Weight: 150 lbs

En. Weight: 154 lbs

By the time I started the program I was able to do 25 push-ups, it will be the most beneficial workout of the program.

**Nutrition:**

For the first phase of the program, whole grains. At the beginning of the second phase, I included peanut butter into my diet and I went for 500-600 calorie surplus. Finally at the third phase, I continued the program with LeanGains approach. 

That's all I did about nutrition. I never checked for macro but I see now that somehow I was always around %40/%30/%30 Carb/Protein/Fat. What I DID check though

**Supplements:**

* Optimum Nutrition %100 Gold Standart Whey
* GNC Salmon Fish Oil
* GNC MegaMen Multivitamin

**What I Would Change If I Started Again:**

* I would write down my reps and weights right from the beginning of the program. (Gives motivation.)
* I would go for failure at each set. (I feel it gives my muscles a better stimulation now.)
* I would do the whole program with LeanGains approach.
* I would use push-up bars right from the beginning. (Also gives better stimulation to muscles.)

**Thoughts:**

Last 90 days was the most awesome days of my life so far. I started this journay primarily to improve my phisique but it gave me much more than that. Being stronger

These were taken after my first 90 days with P90X, and full of excuses.  I cannot emphasize enough how much this program has changed my life and my perception of what it means to be ""fit"".  I am someone who generally had always felt pretty in shape, mainly because I have consistently played a lot of soccer and done a lot of running over the years.  And while I felt I performed pretty well at these things, I now often wonder how much better I could have been without the 14 extra pounds of fat I lost over these 90 days.

I didn't even follow the P90X diet plan exactly, I pretty much only drank water.  I ate pieces of meat that weren't bigger than the size of my fist.  I stopped eating late at night.  I stopped going back for seconds.  I subbed a salad for those delicious fries.  All these little things added up to make a huge difference.  But you know what?  I had a beer and a cookie every now and then too to keep my sanity.  Everything in moderation!

Today I'm even more focused on my nutrition and have completed many other Beachbody programs.  P90X changed my mindset not just towards fitness

I'm sharing this for anyone who feels stuck, and maybe it can help you too.  No matter where you currently are in your fitness (or lack thereof) right now, know this: YOU CAN DO THIS.  Set your goals.  Don't just think of some in your head.  Write them down.  Come back to them every day.  Think about what your life will be like when you reach that goal.  Remember what you're committed to.  You'll have good days and bad days, but in the end it will all be worth it.  No matter what you feel like right at this moment, truly visualize how you will feel after your workout today.  You'll feel incredible and accomplished, so go get after it!

I had absolutely no muscle until '11 when I started working as a Valet attendant part-time. The amount of ~100 yard sprints to pick up and park cars put some muscle on my legs and increased my appetite. I was extremely wary about putting on fat and so started to look into proper nutrition.

I'm a professional geek, get back on the horse and keep going (really nasty welt, though). I figured I'd skip the rest of chest and back and move on to ab ripper. I barely muddled through that, not even coming close to number of reps or proper form (leg crawl's about the only thing I managed to do right). Still, I felt good at actually getting in 30 minutes of exercise, and I could feel it. I hit the shower and went to bed, expecting to feel rough in the morning.

The problem is that I woke up around 3am Tuesday morning in the most intense aching ""pain"" I have ever felt in my life. My arms, everything between knees to elbows... I've gotten beat up working in the yard or at school before and felt sore the next day, but this was nothing I'd ever felt before. My muscles felt... queasy, like your stomach gets with a bad flu. I was sweating like mad, but wanted nothing more than to stay under a pile of blankets, which I did for the better part of an hour, on the couch.

**Something that fits almost all exercises:**
At first you may feel your back getting more of a workout than your core. This will change as you progress. Just try and keep track of how many reps you can do before you have to break and increase it by 1 each time.  

Now for some specific tips.  

**In and Out
At first you probably have your hands on the ground for support. I found if you start like this and want to push out just a few more reps

**Cross legged/wide leg situp**:
I found that I couldn't do a cross legged situp yet, but I may try it like that some more until I can do cross legged better.  

**Scissors:**
This is where focusing on flexing properly really helped me. Try and keep those legs straight as much as possible

**V-up/roll-up:** At first these confused me so I didn't even attempt for a while. If you are having trouble with a certain exercise like this may I suggest just doing a plank for the duration. As your core gets stronger from other exercises

**Oblique V-Up:** I still have a bit of trouble with this one. It can be awkward. You may also find you can do it on one side, or only bringing your shoulder off the ground so you can work out the kinks before bringing it together.  

**Mason Twist:**
For this one all I did differently was instead of starting with them and going to finish.. I waited until 10 reps in before I started. This way I got the motivation speech to keep me going at the end :)  

Hope this helps. If you have any questions or I was unclear about anything

I've been doing 45 minute sessions of stair-climbing to try and help me build up endurance again amongst using Convict Conditioning to help get my base back in order (can barely do 20 pushups right now).

My biggest concern is diet: my wife does all the cooking and she has a firm belief that 'it doesn't matter' what I eat -- meaning, I have tried and failed to lose weight before).  

Now, so me buying all these P90x shakes, bars, massive amounts of fresh fruit/veggies etc is probably out of the question.

I figure what I'll do is try to limit my portion sizes even if I can't really control what's in those portions.  Limit my carb intake where I can and try to eat more protein (though protein is expensive and apparently eggs are bad for you again).

Supplement wise I've taken stock of what we've got lying around the house and I've got half a bottle of vitamin C, a bottle of 120 Omega 3 fish oil capsules, a half-container of protein powder that expired last year (probably not useable...) and yeah... not much else.

I'm going into this with very little support on a few ends of the spectrum but I'm determined to see this through.

I've read that you don't 'need' the supplements/diet to finish P90x

I also read something about 'selective fasting' - does anyone know if that'd actually be helpful to someone in my situation or if it'd hurt me?

It will tell you the amount of calories you need to eat in a day and track your daily food logs as you input them to inform you what you need more/less of. You can search up foods and ingredients that you eat, carbs, and overall calories you need to eat/avoid for the day, and it can also map your weight losses and gains. 

My favorite part of the app is the ability to tell you what percentage of your diet is prot, 30% carbs, and 20% fats. I seriously recommend you do the math and log in on the computer to edit the amounts you need.

The first 30 days go by so fast! 

I come from a primal background, pumping iron twice a week, and low intensity walking or hiking the rest of the week. 

After doing this lifestyle since 2009, albeit with high protein. A few minor modifications and I was good to go. 

At this point I think it's pretty safe to say I am a convert from the primal lifestyle over to more athletic home/gym workouts. I have seen more results in 30 days than I did in years doing more moderate workouts.

I am a few days into the moderate carb phase, and a supplement called ON CGT-10. I ate 1600-2200 cals per day.

Beginning weight was 175lbs ending 178lbs

I looked like day 1 for probably the last 3-4 years

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/19jtkb/starting_p90x_on_monday/

I won't spam this place with weekly updates but since I've had a pretty awesome first week

So

Now this is nice to say on paper

Day one was crazy hard, tanked.  My legs, still good, but I blew out a tendon in my arm a couple years ago and I sort of used it as an excuse to never pick it up again - well, that and getting married/having a kid.

Needless to say, I could barely do 6 and standard pushups killed me at 10.  Like, I was wrecked at 8 but forced myself to do 10.

Needless to say, Tony's advice actually helped me here ""You're going to get better"" - and that, legitimately, helped me keep on going.  

This is starting from zero.

I dropped to my knees and, but I aimed for 5 and managed to get most of them.

Ab Ripper... yeah.  Crunchy Frogs.  Yeah. (Nope).

Day 2: Plyometrics - Now, which were tight and sore as hell.  I walked off to the gym and, since my legs are in decent shape -- I'd been doing stairclimbing and squats over the last few months just to try and eke some semblance of 'health' out of me -- I actually pushed myself to keep up with Tony on the day.  And I did!  I did everything he asked me to and, though some of it really had my legs burning, I pushed myself.

This was a mistake.  A Big Freaking Mistake.

I got a sense of how big of a mistake it was after the workout

I had officially ruined my legs.  The next day

Day 3: Shoulders and Arms.  This one wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  The main obstacle was my inability to move.  It was quite a scene with me trying to do my warm-up jog and unable to lift my heels much more than an inch off the floor.  Luckily since most of the movements were standing - except those goddamned crouching cohen curls - I didn't suffer too much.  Ab Ripper wasn't too kind to me either - trying pull my legs toward my chest... yeah, pain.  I did what I could - which wasn't very much - but I did do the whole video and try each exercise.

After the workout was far worse however, that was some scary shit.

Day 4: Yoga X - My legs were STILL 80% sore, hell, I was happy just to hold the pose, but I made it through the whole session.  The Balance ones were not fun - the tree pose hurt like crazy... but again, I powered through.

Still almost fell down the stairs after the workout though. *sigh*

Day 5: Legs and Back - My legs actually felt a lot better the morning after yoga (only about 30% pain when walking and I could go downstairs with a bit of a hop).  I thought that this workout would hurt my legs more, it seemed to shake out the last bit of the cobwebs.  For Ab Ripper, the highlights were that I managed to squeak out 25 Leg extensions and 6 crunchy frogs.  I did okay on heels to the heavens -- I had to hold my legs up for it to work but I got a really nice burn out of it.

Day 6: Kenpo X - With my legs now fully healed, but 'brand new' is the way to put it.  I just felt so much energy in them and it was nice to be able to move and kick and punch without feeling pain.  Probably the highest 'high' of the week.  Definitely made me feel awesome and looking forward to week 2.

Day 7: Rest.  No stretching

And today, but I'm incredibly psyched to keep on going.  I've realized that this is going to be more than a 90 day commitment to get to where I want to be... but I'm actually looking forward to it.

Anyway

As an extra bonus: On Sunday I went out and managed to (comfortably!) wear a pair of pants that I hadn't been able to fit into since before my wedding.  I'm wearing them now... Feels good man.

TL;DR: Week one is going to hurt and it's going to suck hardcore. But - to me - the way the program is designed - it's almost as if they know that and have worked to help your recovery.  Keep on fighting,False,,t5_2rmaw,1363028427.0,,,t3_1a3hpy

Going to follow the P90x subreddit and I've seen a lot of extremely informative posts - thanks to everyone who has contributed!  I hope to also contribute with my results.

I'm 25 years old, been dieting since March) and I thought I was ready to start to ""get to work.""  My weight loss has almost entirely been as a result of diet and not as result of new or demanding exercises (except the occasional treadmill, which I am glad I started).

I picked up P90x, etc.  Ready to go.  Today was my first day, and needless to say felt pretty discouraged because I could not complete the workout (Classic, Chest&amp;Back + Ab Ripper X).  My question is, as long as I'm pushing myself as hard as I can (within reason, obviously.  Injury is not worth it), is getting it 70~80% of the way through the workout ok to start?  Or would I get better results by doing the entire video but with less resistance (ie. knees, hah!).

I'm personally of the opinion that going 80% at high (for me) intensity would be better than 100% at a lower intensity.  But I'm deferring to the better judgement of you experts here ;)

Alternatively

Just looking for ways to maximize returns and to stick with it.

Thanks again everyone!

I think my results are ok but could have been better due to a couple of reasons.  I say this because I really don't see that big of a difference between my last two photos.

The first reason is I think my results stalled towards the end is because my nutrition went a little downhill during the last month.  I started to binge eat because I think I was being a little restrictive with my calories.  I upped my calories from 1900-2100 to 2600-2800 per day and finally switched from Fat Shredder 50/30/20 to Energy Booster 40/40/20.  The reason I did this is because I felt myself crashing in workouts and kind of dreading to start the workouts because of this.  Once I started to up my calories I had less bouts with binge eating and started enjoying working out again.

I think another reason my results stalled is because I started to get burned out with Insanity towards the end of the program.  When I originally started my health/fitness journey I did a round of Insanity.  Being burned out/bored led me to not working out with the highest intensity but for me it's hard to keep my mind tricked/challenged for too long before I get.  Don't get me wrong I was still getting tired and going hard but wasn't pushing myself like when the program was fresh to me.

All in all I am happy with my results and now I weigh 186 lbs.  It has been a long time since I have ever weighed this much probably like 8th grade tbh and I am 27 now.  I went to the doctors for my physical and asked about what I weighed last year in Feb when I got my check up to begin this fitness journey and I was at 240 lbs.  Over 50 lbs lost in a year!  I definitely am proud of myself and happy I actually kept up with the nutrition and dedication of making this a lifestyle change.

Even though Insanity and P90x gave me great results

Good luck to everyone on their fitness journey and if a lazy normal working guy can get through the program so can you! Don't give up and never say the words can't just say I currently struggle with and work to improve!

Keep up with Nutrition
Keep up with workouts
Don't say I can't 
If you make a mistake with your workout or nutrition forget about it.  It's in the past so don't beat yourself up about it.

**Goals for the next two weeks:**

* 30 push-ups
* 8 chin-ups
* 4 pull-ups
* bigger ass

**Lessons learned/advice to others starting out:**

* Eat 1-2 hours before working out on resistance training days.
* When doing pull-ups/chin-ups, slowly lowering yourself as you get tired
* Get full body massages if possible.  In addition to alleviating soreness
* Ladies
* Wear workout gloves when lifting

Second time I started again with my brother. I did 2 weeks of tabata training to condition myself for p90x. We were both going to do it together and he was a great motivation tool...and demotivation tool.  He was better conditioned than me so i would sometimes have small rivalry thing going where i tried to catch up or surpass his stats over the weeks.  Of course it hurt when he could do exercises i couldn't


But unfortunately one workout session resulted in my shoulder getting injured for a whole week.  This scared the heck out of me.  I kept getting flashbacks to when i hurt my legs and got scared to ""bring it"" during the rest of the workouts.  I started only doing half the routines


I want to try a 3rd time. I want to really commit this time. I want to follow the diet plan, i want to gain weight/muscle, not lose it. Any tips and help for this p90x failure giving it one more try is greatly appreciated.

Thanks for all the words of encouragement and advice.  I'm definetaly taking everything into account. I will post some pics of my progress during the 2nd attempt.

26/M/6ft
Weight unchanged at 92kg/203pounds.
Apps used: 90Droid

A few months ago I decided that if I didn’t get the body that I wanted in my 20’s, with a little abs every now and then. 

I started initially by adjusting diet (mainly portion size and cutting out junk) and lost 6kg/13pounds over a 5 week period. I then discovered P90x

Motivation was high for the first month and I rarely missed a day. Didn’t read much about the diet but a typical day consisted of scrambled  eggs for breakfast and chicken breast or fish filet for lunch / dinner. Had a protein shake (skim milk + a piece of fruit

At the end of the first month a bunch of things happened

I’ve started month 2 now and my motivation is back. 

Overall, though with a 5 minute break halfway. I’ve only done Kenpo once ever, but I figure if I play sports 1-2 times a week it’s no biggie. 

Despite not having stuck with the diet

Some observations and advice for others:
-	I’ve found that it’s better to do your p90 in the gym once you have the routine down. There’s the motivational kick of having other people (especially women) around

-	You can use P90X as an excuse to learn cooking. Who knew that oven baked chicken breast was so easy to make?

-	A 1 hour exercise rarely takes just 1 hour

-	Protein bars taste foul

-	Some P90X cast members are extremely annoying

-	It’s a great motivational kick to see / feel definition where there was none before. Was taking a shower a while back and whoa! Abs!

Now to the nitty-gritty...Why isn't YogaX a good yoga program? Well, strength, and balance. Those are wonderful for anyone who is developing their body, however the biggest advantage of yoga is establishing a stronger mind-body connection. Awareness of where your hips are, how your joints are bent, whether you are lined up, where the edges of your mobility lie, leading to less injuries

In an effort to bust through a ton of vinyasas, feel the proper form. Positions are timed poorly, moving at different speeds on different sides. There is not a good progression to things like upward dog (which is a pretty extreme spine stretch, usually warmed up to by moving through low cobra and cobra). Really, vinyasa is something that requires a good teacher to really get the most out of. When you're in a lunging twist, you can't see your own hips...It's hard to keep track of all the things your body should be doing in a yoga pose, and you can actually create more problems than you solve if you're doing the poses incorrectly.

The balance section is actually pretty good, which Tony himself says you shouldn't be doing back to back. 

If you're familiar with yoga, and skipping out on the yoga belly ripper x. If you're not familiar with yoga, I'd actually suggest dropping $10/wk to go to an actual yoga studio in your area and getting coached on your form. Or do cardio X, or X stretch, or something else that works both flexibility and cardio, but doesn't put you in positions your body isn't used to or ready for.",,,,

Long time lurker of this here subreddit but I have finally decided that I need to make a post since I'm finding myself in a bit of a rut right now..

So a little bit about myself.
I am a 17 year old male living in NY.  I am currently 6'2"" tall (about 188cm) and I weigh anywhere between 300 and 310 pounds based on the day (136-140kg) and my BMI is about 39.8.. only .2 away from being morbidly obese.  I've been overweight for as long as I can remember but I have only recently started realize that I have a serious problem on my hands.  I play football for my high school and in an effort to be even more physically active I did winter track and now I am doing spring track.  Although I am overweight

A few months ago I was at a friend's house for a weekend and he was in phase 3 of his second run through the P90X program and it was then that I decided to try it.  I ordered it in February and started it immediately and fell in love with the first couple of days (I actually enjoyed suffering through plyo!) but I couldn't seem to push myself to continue past day 10.  Since then I have tried to restart the program 3 times and have failed every single time.  My most recent attempt was thwarted by a severe high ankle sprain that had me laying in bed for the better part of two weeks.  

Finally

I am a junior in an ivy league prep school so my workload is pretty heavy and I feel like it will be preventing me from sticking to my plan so I thought I'd lay it out to give everyone an idea of what I'm dealing with.

* 6:30am - Wake up for school
* 8:35am to 3:10pm - I have class
* 3:30pm to 5:45pm - I have track practice
* 7:00pm to 7:30pm - I get home
* 8:00pm - The time that I always start my P90X workout
* 10:00pm - By this time I've worked out
* 1:00am - The time that I usually go to bed

As you can see

In terms of my diet... I am the youngest in the house and when it comes to meals my mom is the one that makes them most of the time so what we eat is pretty much up to her.  While she does in fact cook healthy food, snacks and fast food have been eliminated almost completely from my diet.  
My question here is about the calories.  Should I be eating fewer than the recommended amount? I understand that I need those calories in order to have the energy needed to do the workout but would it be safe to assume that if I can cut lets say 500 calories from that everyday that it will help me lose more weight?  Do any of you have any tips on how to play with the calorie count in order to get slightly results?

Some other things to add..
While I am significantly overweight and I do in fact have a lot of fat to lose
I also take a pre-workout supplement (N.O. - Xplode) and it seems to work wonders for me.  I used it before P90X for days when I wanted to do some heavy lifting and I feel like I'll benefit from it for this workout as well.  I'm open to any suggestions for other supplements that I could take to help me some more.

**TL;DR VERSION**
I'm realizing now that this post is getting pretty long so I'm going to try and shorten it up.  I am determined to go through P90X all the way this time but I need help.  My main issue is my midsection so I'd like to know what days I should try harder on in order to get the most out of the workout.  How can I mess around with my calorie intake to maximize my weightloss?  What kind of supplements can I take?  Will track practice (note: I am a thrower for track so our practice mostly consists of practicing our throws and about twice a week we workout so what should I do in the gym on those days to not interefere with the muscle confusion of P90X?) get in the way of my workout? 

Any and all help and motivation will be greatly appreciated.. I don't have any pictures right now (I keep forgetting to take my pre pictures &gt;.&lt;) but I plan on posting a thread probably this weekend with some in order to give you guys a better idea of what I'm dealing with.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. It isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). 90days is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, it's a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, gender, and height.

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.

It's time to give P90X another try.  About a year ago

My mom died.

At that point

Well, I'm calling this week ""Warm up week"".  Knowing the kind of pain (that oh-so-good pain) I'd be in by Wednesday, I started easy to hopefully mitigate some of that.  I did half of the chest and back (no abs) disc on Monday.  Half of Plyo on Tuesday.  Wednesday I did all of arms &amp; shoulders, and ab ripper.  Yesterday I did all of Tony's One on One Yoga.  I will be doing all of legs &amp; back and ARX today.  Let me say, I already feel good.  Fucking great!  I missed this.

This coming Monday (April 8)

Food will be portion plan and tracked with myfitnesspal.
Supplements will be: [ACG3](http://store.ndsnutrition.com/pmd-sports-nutrition/pmd-acg3/) pre workout, Clif Builder Bars, Creatine Monohydrate, Vitamins, and Omega 3's and 6's from fish oil pills and/or ground flax seed. I've got my kitchen scale out and stocked up the kitchen on Tuesday.  I'm ready. Let's do this.

**tl;dr** About a year ago, will go full bore and start counting my 90 come next Monday (April 8).

Today I finnished my first P90X week(resting day today). As everyone else

My question is about the workout and diet. I'm 6inches tall and 165lbs. I'm pretty skinny
Should I follow the P90X program(phase 1) to get ""ripped"" first and then go for 8reps to gain as much muscles as possible?(phase 2 + 3).

Diet: should I eat more carbs than the diet says because I'm skinny?
My diet this week has been like this:


Breakfast: omelet (6eggs + mushrooms)

Snacks: 1box of tuna

Lunch: salat + bread with fish

Snacks: nuts + apple

Dinner: 10oz cod + white rice + salad

Pre workout: 2 bananas

Workout

After workout: 1box of tuna + apple

Snacks: 2slices of bread with peanutbutter

I will get my whey protein powder in about 2 weeks.

Do you see any faults about my diet?

I think about switching to P90X instead of doing the second phase of P90 since the results might be better after 90 days for P90x.

What do you think about that? Is it a good idea? In total it will be like 45 days of P90 and then 90 days of P90x.

I started p90x over and this time I am doing everything right. If you have read my last post I am still 260 but I am a little bit taller (5'10""). Also I have added another job to my bartending and school. I also bartend at a higher class restaurant so that kind of gives me access to healthier foods.


**Food**
I have been using [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) Which comes in handy because you can just scan barcodes and it has an entire database of foods to pick from. Also I havent been drinking soda, and oranges. For dinner I will have something like Salmon with steamed broccoli , or Grilled chicken with mixed veg.

**Workouts**

So I started p90x again yesterday after having it forever. This time I feel like I am doing it right and will keep doing it no matter what. Day 1 wasnt too much of a problem. I can do a couple of the moves no problem but pull ups are non existent in my world right now

Day 2 is the day I always fear. Plyometircs....... Last time seemed easier compared to this time but Do your best and forget the rest. I stumbled through some of the moves but I kept going

I am looking forward to tomorrows workout and I think its going to be a great start to a great year. I wont fall off this time!
