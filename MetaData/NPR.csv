NPR can be reached [here](http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?sid=15).

This is my comment:

&gt; Dear Tell Me More

&gt;Reddit.com was mentioned in this morning's show of Tell me More about cyber harassment

&gt;Reddit.com is a social news website, ImageShack.com, or the most popular choice, imgur.com. 

&gt;Reddit has grown exponentially since it's inception in 2005. It used to be a website for ""tech"" related content, there are such things as 'subreddits,' which are subcategories that a member can visit and subscribe to, which will make their 'frontpage' more geared towards their own interests and hobbies. Subreddits are created by users, so they can range from any topic. For example, I personally frequent /r/bicycling, /r/linux, and /r/books and other subreddits that peak my interest. There is even an /r/npr (these subreddits are pronounced as such: /r/npr = r npr; /r/bicycling = r bicycling; etc.). However, content on these subreddits is often unmonitored by Reddit administrators. There are not subreddits containing child pornography

&gt;Sexism and racism are a very real problem on the internet, the website now has tens of millions of unique visitors, and the open and anonymous nature of Reddit allows anyone to say whatever they please. Reddit.com as a whole is not racist or sexist, but many users can and will express their opinions. The same goes for any other website that allows for commenting by users, such as YouTube.com, FoxNews.com, Facebook.com

&gt;Your guest was unfortunate enough to fall victim of a terrible crime in which the perpetrator uploaded content of her to Reddit. Unfortunately for her, and she should have acted sooner and ended all contact with whomever uploaded her personal images.

&gt;I thank NPR for providing free and entertaining content over the radio that I listen to everyday. However, /r/SuicideWatch, which helps those who seek help with depression, and who are thinking about committing suicide. There are many other subreddits that lend a helping hand and make a real difference in the community and in the world. 

&gt;In conclusion, because the good greatly outnumbers the bad. 

&gt;I allow permission for NPR to use excerpts from this comment if it were to be mentioned on the air.

Please write to NPR mentioning that Reddit was put under the wrong light

First, and retrieved by the alphabet soup of government agencies.  The zeitgeist may be Narcissus hovering over the vast pond of social media that glamorizes his reflection, but it is an error to assume this behavior somehow translates to a willfull subrogation of privacy in every sense.  With the recent disclosures of the NSA's surveillance capabilities, more Americans are compelled to reevaluate the erosion of privacy in the proper context, [leading many to conclude that things have gone much too far](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/poll-nsa-surveillance-privacy-pew).

Second, such as private browser modes; or add-ons that delete, block, or disrupt tracking cookies and flash, millions of people employ them to reclaim some modest amount of power.  Contrasted with the complex, evolving technical process of shielding our privacy, the relative ease of creating a social media account is within the scope of a lonely night's desperate impulse.  As such

Of course there are plenty of narcissistic, public and private.  Let's also avoid conflating it with the many distinct motives people operate under when they join and interact in online communities.  For the purposes of freer, deeper, more meaningful interactions, privacy, for many of us, is a tremendous asset.

My Job requires me to drive and get in and out of my car a lot. So sometimes I hear the begining or a teaser for a show and miss 80% of what I want to listen to. I generally remember the time of day they aired but never the name of the show. 

For instance today I heard quite a few shows but missed a lot of the conversation. Among them was a story about a guy who pulled a gun on a person. Cats killing too many animals especially birds. The waitress that put the receipt on Reddit. And the French involvement in Mali. None of these shows were on the front page tonight 3 AM. I had to go to each show and push the previous button. 

*Also I have donated $20 to NPR

Let me begin by saying that I am an avid

As usual your recent show What Happened at Dos Erres was superbly executed radio. You manage to move and engage the listener by exploring the humanity of the bad guys and the bravery of the good guys. You show us the profound role that serendipity can play in this Journey that we all take. And

I think, persistent (it spanned many years and presidential administrations) and crucial (including arms, training, diplomatic cover and coups d'état). 

It is not true, including the declassified records cited by Mr. Glass, show that when confronted by many such cases (and in many countries) the US government did, in fact, take decisive action; namely they **increased** funding, arms sales, training and diplomatic cover for the perpetrators.

The case of Guatemala is particularly illustrative in the context of international law. By 1986, if not out right aggression) which ruled that the aid being sent to Guatemala was military in nature and not humanitarian. The US was ordered to pay reparations. Instead, it ignored the ruling and again increased funding to the people committing the crimes. One can only wonder how much easier the jobs of the brave prosecutors and investigators profiled in your show might have been if they had had the support of the US rather than facing explicit opposition. One might further wonder about why facilitators of these crimes walk free in our own country.

Historically there is a clear strain of this kind of activity stretching from the establishment of the Monroe Doctrine to Allende in Chile right up to the most recent coup in Honduras. While you cannot be expected to cover hundreds of years of history

To be clear, arguing that one should ""blame America first"" or that the human side of this story was not masterfully delivered. I simply want to point out that these crimes were not committed in a vacuum and that I feel that we owe it to the courageous people profiled in your show -- and hundreds more like them -- to tell the whole truth. Especially in the cases, like Guatemala, where our own government played an important, if not vital, role.

Recently This American Life has commendably gone out of its way to rectify specific factual mistakes made when publishing Mike Daisy's story about working conditions in China. When settling this issue it was rightly emphasized that, I think that in this case my favorite show of all time has gotten every literal fact correct while missing a very important aspect of the broader context.
