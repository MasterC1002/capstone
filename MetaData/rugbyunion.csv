In the last minute of the first half of the match against the Rebels, passing the ball to the fly-half and running the ball into the Rebels' defence).

So Conor did as instructed and kicked the ball into touch, when he should have passed the ball. Conor looked up at the clock and saw that there were still 30 seconds left to play and then looked over at Zebo who was chuckling away to himself, shoulders rocking, at having spoofed his team mate.

For this outlandish (but hilarious) piece of mucking about, that is what he did, in front of the whole tour party. And when the dice stopped on the number four, the room erupted with cheers because punishment number four required Zebo to telephone his club coach, Rob Penney, and tell him that he wanted to be captain next season. Within a few seconds, Jamie Roberts had dialled the number and rigged up the speakerphone, while 80 players and management stifled their laughter in the background. It did not last long,False,

1370891548.0,1g2ai4,For The Americans: Enough is Enough. My Letter to Universal Sports Network,niggling23,113,21,110,"To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in complaint of your sports Commentator Bill Seward.
As an avid American rugby union fan, is utterly intolerable to listen to when it comes to the sport of rugby.  Furthermore, I believe he is unqualified to call significant international tests such as USA vs. Ireland.  If the USN network hopes to gain the respect of a reputable sport outlet for rugby union, I would like to alarm them that in fact Bill Seward is alienating viewers.

Mr. Seward's lack of knowledge of the game is only surpassed by his mispronunciations, during the USA and Ireland game played in Houston, there were multiple times where Bill subtly scoffed at referee Francisco Pastranaâs misuse of the English language.  Mr. Pastrana hails from a proud rugby nation of Argentina, and English is not his native tongue.  May I remind USN that rugby is in fact and truly a global game, whereby English should not be expected to be the norm, even when playing in the USA, and especially from the referee position.  This should be punishable

While I concede it was a fervent match played in Houston with many mistakes on both sides of the ballâwhich made it difficult to callâBill Seward seems unable to understand the basic laws of rugby.   In fact, and tutor him on the laws of the game, interpretations, and applications.  Unfortunately, on air Mr. Seward sounds like an ignorant American, which is a stigma most American ruggers struggle to overcome.  I can assure you my sentiment is not a lone one.

I find it unfortunate that Mr. Seward has struggled to master the concepts of rugby in his time commentating since the 2011 Rugby World Cup

Sincerely

Niggling23

1335175760.0,snyzx,"Got an email from my Dad today titled ""Why rugby has backs"". Hopefully not a repost",peck3277,111,20,27,"Why Rugby has backs ... . . . . For all you FORWARDS out there. You'll love this.

WHY RUGBY HAS BACKS?

At Last a Rational explanation of the Game. It is largely unknown to players and followers of the modern game that rugby started off purely as a contest for forwards in opposition in line-outs, supreme fitness and superior intelligence in packs against one another. In those days, the winner was the pack that won the most set pieces. The debasement of the game began when backs were introduced. This occurred because a major problem was where to locate the next scrum or line-out. Selecting positions on the ground for these had become a constant source of friction and even violence. The problem was resolved by employing forward rejects, men of small stature and limited intelligence, to run aimlessly around within the field of play. Following a set piece, the ball would be thrown to one of them, who would establish the next location either by dropping it or by throwing it to another reject for dropping. Very occasionally, and crowds would wildly cheer on these rare occasions. Initially these additional players were entirely disorganized but with the passing of time they adopted set positions.

For instance

The five-eighth plays next to the half-back and his role is essentially the same except that when pressured, three-eighths more and he might well have qualified to become a forward.

The centres were opportunists who had no expertise but wanted to share in the glamour associated with forward packs. After repeated supplication to the forwards for a role in the game they would be told to get out in the middle of the field and wait for instructions. Thus, parasites and scroungers who mostly work as lawyers or used car dealers.

You may ask, and because the inside backs were so diligent in their assigned role of dropping the ball whenever they received it, the main contribution to the game made by the winger was not to get involved. Their instructions were to run away as quickly as possible whenever trouble appeared, and to avoid tackles at all costs. The fact that the game was organised so that the wingers didn't get to touch the ball led to an incessant flow of complaints from them and eventually the apt description ""whingers"" was applied. Even though the ""h"" dropped off over the years, the whingeing itself unfortunately has not.

Lastly, someone who was always in the way. The name arose because the forwards would understandably become infuriated by the poor play invariably demonstrated by that person, and call out ""send that fool back"". He would then be relegated well out of everyone's way to the rear of the field. So there you have it.

Let's return to the glory days of a contest between two packs of eight men of statuesque physique,False,self,t5_2qkbe,False,,,t3_snyzx

(Richard Cockerill v Norm Hewitt?) It's better if they can do it with some wit and style. Mooro was pretty good at it as was Sean Fitzpatrick.

Props are obviously less intelligent  as all they have to do is grunt, however, obliged to ruffle their opponents hair when a scrum collapses, although as no one has told them why, they just assume that its in the rule book.

Locks are dopey and generally not even aware that they are being wound up (even by Austin Healey) so they tend to get the piss take a lot without actually realising it. They are the ones that are asked to sort out the opposing wind up merchants which they do cheerfully because that what they enjoy best.  They also are the butt of many jokes and are occasionally required to drink aftershave.

Flankers are much brighter, using knees and elbows whenever they can.

Number eights are pretty much like Forrest Gump.  When someone puts a ball in their hands they are conditioned to run in a straight line for as long as possible and bump into as many people as possible on the way.  They have neither the wit nor wisdom to wind up the opposition effectively but they consider their job well done if they have at least one nosebleed per match.

Scrum halves are absolutely required and expected to be irritating little fuckwits whose job is to yap persistently at the opposition

Fly halves are supposed to be ice cold

Centres tend to be slightly effeminate although as with all girls

Wings fall into two types.  They are either quiet

Full backs are supposed to be intelligent and aloof. They should always stand back from any aggravation and only join in when circumstances demand,,False,self,t5_2qkbe,False,,True

1376116042.0,1k2svf,Debunking the myth of New Zealand poaching,assorti,57,14,64,"There is a misconception that pops up on rugby forums such as this one that New Zealand was and/or is involved in poaching Pacific Island talent. I can only assume the people making these claims are misinformed or ignorant of the fact that the vast majority of Pacific Islanders who have played for New Zealand are NZ-born or NZ-raised.



For example, Tana Umaga (Lower Hutt, NZ), and Keven Mealamu (Tokoroa, NZ - notoriously anti-NZ journalist Stephen Jones once said Mealamu was poached from the island of Tokoroa, not knowing that Tokoroa is a small town in NZ, birthplace of Quade Cooper and Sean Maitland as well).



Right now every Pacific Islander in the ABs was born in NZ. In 2011 there were 3 born in the Pacific Islands: Muliaina (moved from Samoa aged 2), attending NZ schools and were a product of the NZ rugby system. There are very few players that didn't attend school in NZ (such as Greg Rawlinson and Steve Devine) who came to NZ of their own accord.



Not only that but NZ actually exports rugby talent to the Islands. There were 15 NZ born players in the Samoan team in the world cup. NZ exported 38 players in total (not to mention the coaches).
[http://www.rugby15.co.za/2011/09/rwc-2011-players-born-in-other-countries/](http://www.rugby15.co.za/2011/09/rwc-2011-players-born-in-other-countries/)



It's pretty clear that if there is any actual poaching in the sport of rugby it involves importing players from other countries with the clear intention of using the residency rule for future selection. I can think of one European nation that publicly does this. When people claim New Zealand poaches they are either claiming that a white player that descended from immigrants is somehow more of a New Zealander than a brown player descended from immigrants,False,self,t5_2qkbe,1376130415.0,,,t3_1k2svf

1367582914.0,1dm4sb,Lions Squad Discussion: The Props,Congenital_Optimist,45,3,62,"The first of a 9 part installment in which I open up discussion on the Lions squad in each of the positions. Looking at who was selected and who may have missed out.

The thread during the announcement was understandably quite chaotic with a high amount of comments posted in a short amount of time.

I've designed these so /r/rugbyunion can air their views on each position. Whether they disagree or agree with Gatland's Choices.

The first installment may well be the most contentious. Of the 6 props chosen

**The Lucky Ones**

* **Dan Cole** - The cornerstone of the English pack. The young Englishman is only 25 but already boasts a host of caps and has displaced the great Martin Castrogiovanni at Leicester as first choice tight head. Once a loose forward as a young boy

* **Cian Healy** Another young prop who is one of the first names on the Irish team sheet. Has achieved great success with Leinster and delivered one of his best performances in green against Australia at the 2011 RWC. A destructive scrummager and terrific ball carrier.

* **Gethin Jenkins** With almost 100 caps

* **Adam Jones** - Wale's incumbent tight head for the best part of 10 years will embark on his second tour this summer. His scrummaging is top class and his fitness superb. It's hard to see past anyone else starting at 3 for the first test.

* **Matt Stevens** - One of the most controversial and left field choices of the squad. Stevens retired for England duty after the 2012 6 nations to spend more time with his family. Still just 30 years of age the South African born Englishmen can play on both sides of the scrum and his ability in the loose and offloading game has greatly improved this season. Has been part of the Saracens squad following a return from a ban following a cocaine problem in 2011

* **Mako Vunipola** - The closest thing to a bolter in the squad. The Tongan born, his scrummaging still needs work on but his natural rugby ability around the park is not seen often in props.

**Who Missed Out?**

* Mike Ross
* Euan Murray
* Geoff Cross
* Ryan Grant
* Andrew Sheridan
