1346076758.0,ywjo2,"My Birth Story: or, How I Fired My OBGYN at 39 Weeks Pregnant, And Lived To Tell The Tale. ",fifthredditincarnati,52,28

I was, blindly, without looking anything up or consulting other experts. I signed up with the OBGYN that my primary care physician recommended, and never asked any questions about anything, simply assuming that everyone naturally had MY best interests at heart in addition to the baby's. 

They didn't

The doctors turned out to be shitty ones. Looking back it seems to me they did everything in their power to make sure I had a very medicated, this is huge. Internal exams really freak me out, I start shaking at even the mention of one. I was sobbing hysterically through all the medically unnecessary internal exams they did on me. I had no idea I could say no to the exams!) By almost every metric it was a perfectly fine birth with only a few small complications (pitocin-induced labor, vacuum assisted birth, the 4th degree tear requiring 18 stitches that thankfully healed quickly, some hemhorraging was fixed with a blood transfusion later that night), but the whole event left me feeling like utter shit: pressured, dissed from all the negative talk directed at me

The funny thing is I didn't even realize how much I had hated the experience. At the time, and thought that they were just an awesome bunch of people to have dealt with a ""challenging patient"" like me so well. So when I got pregnant this time, *I signed up with the same OBGYNs again*. 

Their pressure tactics started again, and I gained only 14lbs my first pregnancy, lost it all, and gained 9lbs this time, so I wasn't by any means very big!), etc etc etc. I felt depressed, pressured, but somehow never thought of switching doctors.

Anyway, and I knew I would have to be very firm and very assertive this time around if I was going to have the birth experience that I wanted - as natural as possible. 

So I sat down with my husband and together we made the plan. I feel like I should scan those pages and post them here just so you can look at them: it reads like we were preparing for war. According to the plan, to stop them from doing medically unnecessary tests and exams, to enforce the ""no internal exams"" rule, and so on and so forth. Practically every bullet point could be categorized under ""HOW TO STOP THE DOCTORS AND NURSES FROM DOING MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SHIT TO ME"". 

This should have been a big fucking clue I had chosen the wrong doctors

Then came the fateful 39th week appointment. The RN I was meeting that day walked in

""I don't want to be induced unless it is medically necessary

""Well,"" she said.

I wasn't having any of it. ""Well, it was ridiculously painful.""

""Well

I was relieved that she hadn't continued pressuring me. But then she started again. 

""So we need to do an internal exam this week

My heartbeat went into overdrive. ""I'm sorry, right?""

""Well

I was genuinely confused. ""Well

""Well

I blinked. ""But ... that would be *awesome*. That's my DREAM birth scenario!""

She looked at me in that kind-but-patronizing way that doctors sometimes do when they think your IQ is hovering at about 50 today. ""But aren't you worried there might be complications? What if something goes wrong

I laughed. There was nothing else I could do. I couldn't believe she was threatening me with DEAD BABY for refusing a tiny little internal exam! ""Um

Her tone became very stern. ""So that's a risk you're willing to take

""Sure. Just like I could die on my way home now in a car crash

""You're willing to risk your baby dying

""My baby *isn't* going to *die*, and this time I let my irritation show in my voice. 

""That's a real shame



All along the drive home I was seething... and by the time I came home I was just stoking my anger to keep from crying. Crying from what? I don't even know. I was angry, here I had had to put up such a ginormous fight just to refuse an internal exam! I was so pissed off with myself for choosing these doctors again. 

The minute I got home

Now for the harder part: research. I live in a medium-sized town

So I looked online to see if there were any stats on the rate of interventions in the area hospitals. I found a report dated just two months ago in my local newspaper. HALLELUJAH yet again!

I picked the hospital with the lowest intervention rate and searched for articles and/or reviews of it online. There weren't any reviews

Then the clincher - my first child's truly awesome pediatrician was attached to the same hospital. If I picked this hospital I wouldn't have to see all new doctors

I took it as a sign. I called the new doctors and booked an appointment ASAP. I called my old doctors, saying what a shame it was that they had been so unprofessional. I called my old hospital and cancelled my pre-registration. I had my husband fax over my records to the new doctors and the new hospital. I was a *whirlwind* of problem-solving efficiency!

Two days later at my appointment

Then my OBGYN walked in

""NO!"" I was practically yelling at her. 

""Good

I could have *cried* in relief.  :-)

Second: there were good people in that thread who saw the jerkwads for jerkwads and called them out and yelled at them. This is good! But the mod team would also appreciate a quick heads-up that a jerkwad is currently jerkwadding in a thread. **You can help us out by clicking on the ""report"" button you see under every comment. Don't worry about overreporting. The mods look at every reported comment

Third: My heartfelt apologies to the OP of that thread, and been made to feel the brunt of common social prejudices here on this subreddit. This subreddit strives to be a better place. Hopefully with more moderators watching out and more users reporting shitty comments, we can get better soon.

I hate the term ""we're pregnant"", I guess.  At least he's going to watch me be pregnant and says he's going to ""take care"" of me.  I'm not even sure what that means yet.  I don't have any children.  I'm 30 years old and have been dying to be a mother for over 5 years.  When I met Cody I knew he was the one right away.

I called my mother to tell her the good news and she wasn't UNsupportive, I agree.  We should've gotten married first.  That's what I wanted but this is how it happened and that wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear.  The really funny thing is that she got married before having kids and it didn't do her much good, but I digress, I do wish we were married before this but whatever.

So now we're planning a bit of a shotgun wedding.  Cody is really happy and so am I.  The awkward thing is that we just recently separated for the first time.  About 6 months ago I asked him to move out and started seeing other people.  I thought it had been 5 years and we weren't headed towards marriage and may be I needed to move on but we just ended up seeing each other anyways.  Now he's moving back in asap and I'm planning a wedding at the same time I'm planning for the baby.

And I have no clue what to expect.  The funny thing is that I'm actually a medical assistant by trade and work at an OB-GYN clinic.  Why do I feel like I know nothing all of a sudden though?  And I'm not going to lie quitting alcohol will be a minor challenge (I'm not a heavy drinker but it's nice to have a glass of wine when I get home from work) but quitting smoking pot is going to be a challenge.  It's my one crutch.  And while I don't intend on SMOKING pot I thoroughly intend on eating any special treats that come my way and I am not going to feel guilty about that.  Okay okay

I have to clean the house obsessively and go drink a ton of water and look at myself making fake pregnant belly in the mirror now.

Thanks for being an outlet.

Edit: Cody has now decided to freak out, has come around and is being supportive and is even coming up to visit.  She says he's just freaking out and he'll come around but he's said some really hurtful things.  He's saying that I did this on purpose!

A little bit of back story?  He found a lump on his balls a few weeks ago and suddenly he started talking about trying to have a baby, we PLANNED sex!  I told him I was ovulating and he was THERE!  Now he's saying that never happened and that I manipulated him?  WTF?!  I TOLD him I was ovulating and he came in me!  How is that manipulation?!  It's not like I lied and told him I wasn't ovulating and it was safe!

1353403077.0,13i34v,34 weeks and freaking out,newreddit_1,24,10,11,"To put this as simple as possible:

I just found out how far along I am, but at the same time I have to withdraw from my classes this quarter and move back home near my boyfriend until I have the baby. 

Up until now we thought we were going to abort the baby, I have not been taking care of my body the way I should have been. As a college student I do frequent the party scene, drinking a few times this school year, in addition to many occasions over the summer. I also have not been watching what I eat and I fear that this will result in either defects with  the baby or complications in the birthing process in general, which brings me to the final part...

I'm terrified of giving birth. As someone still in their teen years, coupled with the fact that after this whole process the baby will be going home to a different family. While it will be difficult to give up the baby, I am thinking that since I have not felt this ""bond"" with the baby, it might not affect me as much as I may think. 

I do have a few questions to ask though:

What can I do to keep the baby healthy for the last few weeks of this pregnancy?

For anyone who has given up a baby for adoption

Because of my unhealthy lifestyle for the majority of the pregnancy

Any other advice from similar experiences would also be greatly appreciated

1363624837.0,1aj5nh,Birth story time!,PlaidCoat,13,3,3,"This is going to be kind of long.

Our little dude was due on February 19th, and scheduled an induction for he 27th of February. For most of the pregnancy he had been frank breech, and flipped over the day before I went in for a scheduled manual version. I figured if I scheduled the induction he might just decide to come out on his own. I was so wrong.

We went to a diner to get breakfast, even with being induced.

Sometime around noon the on call OB came in to check my progress, and my contractions had no real pattern to them. It was actually like one huge contraction that sucked a little less for some of the time. 

When the new nurse came in at 2PM I asked if it was okay for me to take a nice hot bath

This new nurse wasn't keen on me walking around L&amp;D either

The next shift change came (maybe around 7PM?), Jackie, smiles and tells me her own labour stories and helps me try a few new positions. She checks how I am progressing, 4cm 80% effaced and -1 station! She turned my pitocin down to an 8 (from a 16) to try and get my contractions into some sort of pattern.  We talk a little bit about pain management and tells me that she is totally okay with whatever I feel that I need, but she won't suggest anything, and prefer that if I feel like I need it I should ask her. I told her that was awesome and that was in my birth plan... which I left at home. We talked and she thought the baby was maybe sunny side up, and that's why he wasn't progressing. She also explained some things

Jackie stayed with me for her entire shift

The new over night nurses came in, she gave me a cervical check, 5cm 100% effaced and 0 station, awesome nurse told me that it was time for her to go and wished me luck. I fell back a sleep.

When I got up at 7... the morning nurse from the morning before was in the room, and it was really fine. I told her that I wanted to avoid sitting bolt up right because of what the night nurses had said. She told me no that sitting up right was a fine way to labour. I asked her when I was due for more pain medication, and she told me that they normally only let people have pain meds twice, so I was already over what I could have. But... I could have more at 8:30. Also she didn't see why I didn't just take the epidural already. This didn't make any sense to me and I started crying and went and sat on the toilet. It took me 5 minutes to relax enough to pee.  When I came out of the toilet I asked her to just please leave the room so I could labour in peace because she wasn't helping the situation at all. 

This is where things really start to get more blurry. After a few more hours my pitocin was back up to a 16, since I had to be in bed anyways, but it was hard to do when the nurse wasn't interested in helping really. 

At some point awesome nurse Jackie came back and told me I was still at 5cm. Damnit. She asked if I wanted to try and do pelvic tilts and stuff while I was in bed to see if it got anything going. My OB came in and checked to see how I was feeling/progressing and checked on baby. His heart tones where getting a bit weird. We talked about c section and I asked for some more time to try to get baby to move down on his own. 
I tried pelvic tilts

I said screw it and told my OB I was fine with the section at this point. The OR team swooped in

They got me ready pretty quickly and changed the meds in my epidural. I could still move my toes, but still it didn't take. They put me under. I woke up a few hours later being wheeled from labour and delivery to the postpartum department. I remember being shown the baby in the hall way, and hitting the ""new baby button"" which plays a nursery rhyme through out the hospital every time a baby is born.

My partner and I never talked about how we would announce a name if I had to be put under

But anyways. These are problems that I had much more severe with my 1st pregnancy and now 27 weeks with my second, I have it down to an art how not to throw up. I have even gained 14 pounds. (I was at neg 20 pounds at this point with my first). Now I have a cold/flu from hell that is causing me to have trouble breathing and now I'm not just throwing up food and liquid into my mouth but mixing it with a delicious blend of mucous. I have had this cold for six days now and have had insane headaches body aches and congestion. Luckily no fever. These cold/flu symptoms normally wouldn't phase me much, but add it on top of constant nausea, a hemeroid that my husband swears is an alien protruding from my asshole, and constant heartburn followed by burning throw up in my mouth and its enough to make anyone lose it. So I have decided instead of crying which will do no good at all but congest me further.  I will laugh at the insane agony that I am in. It sucks but at the end of the day it is more than worth it.

I found out I was pregnant last December at around 6 weeks. We had been trying for 6 months. I was terrified and it wasn't until my ultrasound at 21 weeks that I truly believed there was a baby growing in me!

First trimester I was super tired and horny. Second trimester I was much more energetic. Third trimester I was back to being sleepy

Throughout the pregnancy I suffered from SPD and SI joint pain. I craved fruit and had aversions to practically everything but mainly rosemary

I didn't go into labour naturally. Two days before I was due to finish work my water broke early in the morning. It gushed for 12 hours and I was induced with ocytocin. I was in labour for 19 hours.

I took forever to progress

I pushed for an hour with my mom and husband supporting me before my little Colin was born :) he was 7lbs 5oz.

I had a 2nd degree tear. I'm only just starting to feel back to normal now

Colin had jaundice

Since bringing him home it has been very challenging. I don't get much sleep. Breastfeeding is not working out for me. I've had challenges from the beginning and I'm about ready to give up. I love giving him the bottle too

I got pregnant back in February from a fling I had with a friend of mine. When I told him about the pregnancy, was very forgiving of that. I'm not going to attack him for child support because that's way more of a hassle than I need right now (plus a lot of other reasons that I'd rather not discuss) unless he wanted to participate in her life as the acting father. Another thing to note is that there's a little bit of doubt as to if it really is his because I was living with a really awful and abusive person who tried to kill me and may have raped me. However, we can't be sure because I have lacunar amnesia about the matter and don't really remember anything much.

Currently, which seemed like a very good move. However, after thinking about it some more, I was wondering if he could just sign the birth certificate. We were thinking I would leave it blank at first, and then he would adopt her afterward, but is it possible to skip the process?

I am so glad that I discovered this subreddit! So, we have two boys (2 and 4), and just found out were pregnant with our third (This one was actually planned). My problem is this-- although we are so excited to finally have planned one, and have lots of support from his family and our friends, I am terrified to tell my parents. I am just finishing up my degree (will graduate in June, and due in July--which is how we planned this out), and right now we have only one income-- we are making it by just fine at the moment but just not much wiggle room-- but obviously the plan is for me to jump into the workforce post delivery. 

Anyway, my mom came from it and my dad earns it-- I am an only child, although my dad had two kids right out of highschool, so I have 2 half sisters but they are well into their 40's and live across the country. My parents think that you need to make three figures if you are going to be able to appropriately support ONE child, and up until the past year still were trying to convince us to give up our second child because there was no way we could ""afford it"". I know they will be unsupportive of our choice and it kills me, because at this point in my life I should be able to share this news with my family and have them be happy for me, but I know there will never be a point in my life that I will be able to do that with them. 

My dad thinks we are idiots for having more than one child and complains about how we won't be able to do all of the things for our kids that he did for me (has bought me 2 cars, etc.). In reality, this is untrue since both of my boys have trust funds set up through my grandfather to pay for their college, cars, homes, etc) Although I see his point about not being to afford it all by ourselves.

Anyway, but it is just not something they believe in.

My problem is that I've noticed I've become very territorial of her but only with a specific friend of ours.

Every time we are all together and we discuss the pregnancy and the future I feel like this friend is trying to ""out do"" me in the whole best friend department.

As you can imagine, and my poor partner, though trying not to let it show, was in dire need of some reassurance before we left. Once we got in, all of the hospital staff were lovely - it was really quiet in there which surprised me, in a nice way!

We were sent up to the assessment room on the delivery suite because I'm over 24 weeks, 24 weeks is so little. So the midwife who was checking went off and got a doctor and an ultrasound machine. They scanned me and straight away found her heartbeat - very reassuring!

The reason they couldn't find it initially and that I couldn't feel her was that for some reason she was lying very, and of course the second they'd found her on the monitor she started kicking away where I could feel it.


So all worked out fine in the end, as we were getting ready to leave, as well, was really lovely - told us to come back in any time we were worried about anything, and not to be feeling like we couldn't because everything was fine this time. Said they were always here for us for checking up on anything. It was a really lovely experience, oddly enough!",,,,

1355419486.0,14skok,Pregnant girlfriend broke up,IntolerableCynic,10,7,7,"Well

I'm 20

Our relationship has been up and down like most relationships

She did break up with me around five months ago, and she told me she missed me, and that she wanted to give us another chance. Great!

Things were awesome again. We spent a lot of time together, she had been lazy with her birth control pills. We both knew, and figured we'd be okay. She got pregnant.

We both agreed to get an abortion, we're not ready to have any children yet.

I didn't handle the situation very good leading up to all this, and I haven't been very considerate as to what she's going through - both in body and in mind.

In my defense

She has no idea how much I've thought about it

Up until about two weeks ago we spent a lot of time together. She stayed at my house for a month

However, not wanting to have sex, not wanting me to touch her, and so on. I questioned it a lot, and I got a little hurt and offended, not even considering that it was all part of the pregnancy. At this point, she's around 8 weeks pregnant.

She left on Saturday two weeks ago to spend some time with her family and to visit her grandmother, and I was a bit hurt by that fact.

She kissed me good bye

Usually, before going off to work, she would call me. She would usually text me when at work, whenever she had the chance. We would always talk to each other when she went to bed. I have always been used to us talking a lot when weren't with each other.

The last two weeks she has been gradually withdrawing from me. She hasn't initiated much contact, and more often than not she wouldn't answer me, and I ended up texting her instead.

It was never anything important, which I felt was unusual for her.

Our interactions felt more... Casual. I could tell she obviously wanted her space

Sometimes, where she told me she was busy or whatever. Again, unusual for her.

I also tried to meet up with her to talk face to face, that she was busy, or too tired, or whatever. Fair enough. I didn't push too much, and asked if another day was better.

My reasoning was that she was withdrawing because she didn't really want to have an abortion, no matter what she ended up doing. She didn't want to meet up, it seemed, and I didn't want to do it over the phone.

I wanted to meet up

At one point, and she told me she wanted to spend time alone and just sort her head out, and think about stuff. She wasn't very specific as to what, of course, but I suspected - like i mentioned - that she was doubting her initial decision to have an abortion. I told her I was worried about her needing to think and sort her head out, fearing that she was doubting our relationship and her decision to have an abortion.

On Monday this week she had an appointment with her doctor

Anyways

Later that day, and that she probably wouldn't ever again, and that we shouldn't talk for a while. She also said she cared a lot for me, and that she still wanted me in her life, but just as friends.

This is exactly what she told me last time she was under a lot of stress and ended up breaking it off with me, when things settled down.

I didn't respond, and she texted me back saying she's sorry for hurting my feelings.

Later that night, I want to be there for her and the baby. Better late than never, right?

She was probably asleep when I sent it

First she responded telling me it was already done - the abortion that is. I told her I didn't know what to feel about that

""That was what you wanted. I can't just abandon my life and you can't just start thinking like that now that it's over. Good timing."" Bad attempt at translating from Norwegian. lol

Then she texted me and told me she hadn't terminated it yet

Later that day, to which she responded ""I'm going to get rid of it, and I'm doing it alone.""

After a little back and forth of me trying to tell her that I felt like shit about all that was going down, and that I told her what I felt about it all wouldn't change a damn thing, and that we wouldn't get back together because of it.

I don't know what to make of all this. I'm so confused. I was supposed to be there for her

This is all a mess

So relieving to hear something that takes a positive approach to birth. The woman who runs it is a midwife here who had previously worked as a doula, and of those:

* 15% have involved an epidural

* 6% have needed a c-section

The survey asks about perceived experiences of birth as well

* Most described the phase of active labour (so 5-10cm dilated) as either 'comfortable' or 'uncomfortable'. 
* Only 7% described it as 'terribly painful'. This is such a vast contrast to the normal narrative of birth as seen in the media. 
* Most described too the baby's head emerging as 'uncomfortable'.


Having done mindfulness mediation before and knowing that it really works for me to cope with stress and life in general I was really open to the hypnobirthing idea anyway, really reinforced it for me. It was great for my partner too. We watched a few birth videos of women giving birth who'd used hypnobirthing methods and they were all SO calm. The one in the Irish setting in particular that we got to see was really, really reassuring.


I know I'm very lucky in being able to afford the course - it was quite expensive, but I really feel it was worth it. Part of the course is being given the tracks the woman who runs the course has recorded, but the main parts of them are very similar to a freely available one I had been listening to as well from [here](http://archive.org/details/HypnoBirthing), if anyone else wants to give it a go.

My girlfriend and I were dating for about 7 months now. However, and what I wanted to do about it. She was hurt, and I didn't feel good breaking up, but better then being in a bad relationship and breaking up years down the road.

I thought that was the end of it, but I was willing to believe she saw I wasn't going to put up with some of her bad things  and was trying to change. 

We decided to try to make it work again, you're fucked. I've been dumping the semen from the condom into me after we've been having sex, and I am 1 month pregnant.

She is now in Shanghai (she's Chinese), here I am.

I talked with her,000 to abort the baby.

I have no idea how to handle this. I tried reminding her she's a beautiful

I offered to pay the child support and do what I'm legally obligated to do

What do you guys think she should do? Am I wrong in thinking that an abortion is the best move here? I've been called nothing but an asshole, and the like from her and her mother. I have never said anything hurtful back to them. I know it's horrible to kill an innocent baby, but it's even worse for her to go through with it. A baby is truly a wonderful thing, but at this time, it will really reduce what she can do with her life.

At this point he was measuring huge, in the 96th percentile and I was fighting for my due date (which I was sure of because I was doing the basal body temperature thing when I got pregnant.)
At my last ultrasound he had dropped down to the 88th percentile
Last Wednesday I had to go to the ER for 5 minute apart contractions
Today I go in for a Non-stress test

Then my fundal height came in at 31.5 weeks

I hate not knowing whats going on. And I hate being told not to worry until next Monday.  I am pretty strong in my Christian faith so I am trying super hard to pray and not be anxious. Does anyone have any advice/stories/knowledge to share?  I think talking about it and staying informed is the best way for me to stay chill.  I know if he stops growing they will induce/c-section me. I've really been hoping for a natural birth at a birth center. I'm also worried about my contractions... could my body be trying to tell me he needs out?
I'm also afriad of the idea of having a 32/33 weeks preemie if he has stopped growing.

I had awful, I just want to sit down and fall asleep everywhere I go. I've been nauseous for the last ~3 weeks, on the edge of puking fairly often. I did puke once about a week ago when giving oral, his penis hit my throat and it immediately caused me to vomit on him.

I had a sudden attack of diarrhea on Monday, I never get that unless I'm sick. I've had headaches constantly this last few weeks. That may just be from dehydration though, as sometimes I just don't drink as much water as I should. No backaches, spotting, but it's been horrendous how much discharge I've had. I have to wear a pantiliners because it just randomly leaks. I'm not sure if I've had mood swings, and I love chocolate. Haven't really noticed any particular cravings. I've been very thirsty constantly lately but I'm usual very thirsty to begin with. My libido is usually very high

All that being said... I am on BC, and it came up negative. I'm taking another this Sunday and another the next. 

What I really want to know is the following: is it possible to have a period while pregnant? Is it possible that my lateness in inserting the ring caused my entire cycle to be nullified? Do you think the symptoms point to pregnancy? Thank you all for your help

I had my anatomy scan at 20 weeks, laid on both sides, got up and walked around and no dice. I didn't want to find out the sex with out my S/O because he is in the UK, and I am in the states. It didn't seem fair to know before he did. The sonographer turned off the monitor when she got to the goods. But she printed a picture, and put it in a sealed envelope for me. When I got back I waited for my so to get on skype and we opened it together. It's a boy!

Even though I always said I wasn't hoping for either sex

Anyway. Cut to a week ago, and things came to a head when he again interrupted me. I yelled at him that he did not get to talk to me like this, and I went to leave the back room, and stood between the door and I. I told him politely get the fuck out of my way. The next day, I quit. 

I talked to my old boss to see if the project was still going on, and I am feeling a bit absurd to be honest.
