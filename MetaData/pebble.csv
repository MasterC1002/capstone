[CloudPebble](http://cloudpebble.net) is an online application that aims to provide you with everything you need to do pebble development. You edit source files, but give it a try! It might especially be worthwhile if you're using some platform where compilation is hard, or you don't like command lines. It also handles resource_map.json for you!

Here are some screenshots:

It's *very much* still a work in progress

Planned **future** features include in-line documentation/autocomplete, GitHub support, …; I just need the time!

Note: use a recent-ish web browser to access it. Tested on Safari 6 and Chrome whatever-they're-on-now. You can use anything you like to download the compiled watchfaces

**EDIT**: You can also now either follow [@CloudPebble](http://twitter.com/CloudPebble) on Twitter or look at [blog.cloudpebble.net](http://blog.cloudpebble.net/) for continued updates!

In the very beginning the Pebble crew told everyone just how this thing was going to work. Sure, they wee bombarded with 100 times the amount of money they were asking for. So now they have to make 100 times the watches they were expecting right from the get-go.

They also said in very plain English that black would be the first color made. They said it just like that. BLACK FIRST!! It isn't rocket-science that the amount of people wanting this watch is so great. The idea is great. But nobody ever wants to wait as long as it takes. In reality-if you weren't prepared to wait for the watch

They were very to-the-point that things got out of hand when the orders just kept pouring in. The Septembe 2012 timeframe was for-sure a very bad guess at a delivery timeframe

They even gave an idea about what colors would be manufactured in what order. And guess what-that is exactly what is happening. I say to Pebble-Give these folks their money back and put names in their places with people who won't whine about it. 

From where I am sitting these Pebble guys are doing a pretty darn good job considering all the hoopla around their idea. I would have pooped myself for sure by now. Heck

- Ability to exclude all notifications from certain applications (only outside of Tasker)

- Ability to only send notifications from certain applications (only outside of Tasker)

To do this they need developers to want to build them

-  Improve PebbleKit
- Give watch apps an easy way to access the internet via the phone
- Improve notification support for iPhone users (iOS7 will help with this
- Enable magnetometer
- Build a Pebble App store to make finding/buying/installing Apps easy for users. This will also provide a revenue stream (and incentive) for developers as well as for Pebble themselves.
- Improve customer support (Get Satisfaction / Uservoice might help)
- Enable IFTTT support
- Improve the built-in apps (e.g Peapod replaces music App

Watchface Apps have a certain wow factor but once you've picked the ones you like you rarely change them. Pebble's real usefulness will stem from Apps that can offer functionality that replace or duplicate a task that would typically require you to reach for your phone

There are several different App types that developers should be able to develop. These can be Apps that:

- pull data from the internet and display it in useful ways (e.g. weather app
- interact directly with online services (e.g. foursquare check-in app)
- act as secondary display for phone apps (e.g. Runkeeper
- capture data from the watch sensors (e.g. Swim computer

Once the APIs exist so that developers can create all four types of app easily, with bigger budgets, entering the space, their only hope is to build a vibrant dev community behind Pebble, before its too late.",Other,False,t5_2txls,True

Reasons to ship the SDK:

 * Keep promises to community
 * Get people interested in developing
 * Get an early start on competitors
 * Open the platform up to 3rd parties

Reasons to not ship the SDK:

 * The firmware on the watch isn't finished [Pebble is embarrassed to share it]
 * Conditional agreement of a possible acquisition [i.e. Apple]
 * Exclusivity deals with 3rd party developers [i.e. RunKeeper]

Let me start off saying I'm 15 *(gasp)* and live in Canada. I haven't really worn watches my whole life, didn't browse the web too much. I mostly worked my butt off cleaning and doing school work. I digress.

Anyway

I turned it on, my friends, anyone who noticed it, but for the most part it just blends in like any other watch. Then it became part of my life.

Pebble worked just as I expected, but didn't do much. So then came the SDK. I came home, fired up /r/pebble (which I went on probably 15+ times a day for new news) and found that the SDK was released. I installed the few watchfaces that were available at the time and I was a happy camper. Finally there was more to show people, and pebble could now do so much.

As the weeks went on I still browsed /r/pebble, new game or app. I'm poor at french and let's just say that pebble came in handy for a couple tests so far. I felt like I was wearing what was like the iPhone when it was just released.

But what I thought was a cool aspect to look at pebble was that it is something I'll be telling my kids/grandkids (hopefully) about. My dad tells me how he thought it was cool back in the day to be able to play asteroids on his Commodore-64

Now I have an orange gadgetwrap on my pebble, Notifications (pebble reminder), DropType, Orbtime, Glance, and Watchnote on my pebble.

Sure there were complaints

So thanks TeamPebble for all the hard work you have put into it. Thanks for an awesome product.

**TL;DR:** Pebble worked fine when I got it, changed my life, changed the world, thanks pebble.

If you've read this far

1361889267.0,199d6j,Rather than write a post whining about the lack of response from support I figured I'd offer some suggestions regarding my experience,pursuelubu,51,12,26,"To Pebble:

I have been working in the support industry for a little over 12 years now working with companies from startup to large corporations with infrasturcture

Having my own experience with your support system and taking a few guesses on how your backend works I figured I might point out some simple tweaks that I employ anytime I take on a new company which provide some customer satisfaction as well as organization which may be of use to you guys:

1. Send a confirmation upon initial submission referencing some sort of id number to your ticket so that clients are aware and also able to respond directly to that issue instead of continually submitting new tickets. It creates whitenoise/backlog otherwise. I first submitted a ticket 14 days ago today and never got a reply. I sent one a few days later thinking maybe it didn't go through. Thinking then perhaps my email address was being filtered as it was a .info domain I used my work email twice. Because of my uncertainty of my problem being addressed you obtained 3 extra tickets with the same exact issue and I'm sure other people have sent far more than 4 submissions.

1. Stop using email support. While this creates a ""personal"" feel to support it is very hard to manage and clients can miss a response. It is better to use a system that is tracked with a login as it becomes centralized and easier for a client/customer to pull up their ticket history should they need to relate to a past issue. This is something very important as iPhones typically aren't configured to go past 2 weeks in history but also opens up to suggestion 3.
1. Use a form that has a sort of automated system to assign a priority to a ticket based on what a user selects as their issue in a webform. This allows for a much more organized flow in responding to issues and making sure that people with larger issues are handled in a timely manner over those continually emailing asking when their watches are shipping.
1. Lastly

I hope perhaps these suggestions may find of some use to you,False,self,t5_2txls,False,,,t3_199d6j

* 4/18 - $806
* 4/19 - $533

1362609374.0,19sz09,Basic UI/Features Request.,almightywhacko,42,4,48,"I know that apps are supposed to be developed by the community in order to add additional functionality to the Pebble

* Static battery indicator on main menu screen. (seen this request a lot)

* Option to have back light turn on at button press but NOT through accelerometer shake. My back light goes on far too frequently and often when I am not looking at the watch.

* Back light duration. Right now I think it is set to about 2 seconds however this is often too short for me to read the time. Maybe offer a toggle like 2s (default)

* On main-menu screen

***EDIT**: It looks like the left button request will make it into the 1.8.2 firmware*

* Sub-menus for Watch Faces and Apps. Currently these are just thrown into the same menu as with other basic watch features like Settings and Music control

***EDIT**: It looks like the sub-menus request will make it into the 1.8.2 firmware*

* Option to turn off vibration. Additionally

* Font Size change should give an indication of the difference between the two options. This could be as easy as making ""small"" displayed in the small font and ""large"" displayed in the large font.

* ""Classic Analog"" watch face with no second hand in order to extend battery life. I know this is a ""new"" watch face request

* This is for the Pebble smartphone app

* Another app suggestion: It would be amazing to have the option to get notifications sent to your Pebble when new apps and/or watch faces are made available.

All in all I am very pleased with my Pebble and I think it is a great product!

The bush was full of thorns and a branch ripped the pebble off my wrist. I was more concerned with the scratches on my body and didn't realize the pebble wasn't on my wrist. I got to our stop and realized I didn't have it. So I had to hike back to where I fell. My phone connected back to the pebble, but I just didn't notice. So happy I found it.

http://i.imgur.com/HHLAQIT.jpg

I was a backer very early on 4/11 PST, ""Processing Shipment"".   I got the shipping notification the day after it hit USPS.

So, minimalist Skagen watch.


We'll start with the good news:  Pros:

* It's here!  As a backer of many stuck and in-limbo Kickstarters
* Pairing to my phone did end up requiring a reboot before it paired correctly
* The vibration is good and strong
* It's great having instant access to review SMS and caller ID on your wrist.  But like all instant-access-tech
* The magnetic-charger is cool
* The 'flip your wrist' to turn on the backlight is cool
* The special ""Kickstarter Edition"" acknowledgement on the back is really fun.




Cons: 

* The software stack isn't super robust yet.  For instance, a mild irritation.  Watch face selection's pretty basic, hopefully the community will make this awesome quickly.
* It's a pretty thick and chunky-looking thing.  Was hard to tell from the photos
* The buttons are a bit chunky and fiddly.  Possibly a result of the waterproofing
* Don't like the stock band much.  I've got a replacement on the way.
* So far

Meh:

* It leaves another notification icon in the bar and in the drawer.
[Edit: Apparently
* The backlight doesn't stay on for long enough.

My Pebble arrived yesterday afternoon (or the notification that it was at the post office did anyway)

Getting a new product off the ground isn't a simple process and while we've waited a little longer than first anticipated for our watches I have little to no problems at all with the way things have been handled and the road that's been taken.
I am far from the most patient of people (as my family will attest) but I hardly think that 6 months (I think) 'late' is still pretty damn good.

For comparison

Also lets not forget that this is a first generation product (Produced by a small group of people rather than backed by a big name like SONY or Apple)and its bound to have teething issues as expectation meets reality and I for one am pretty stoked to be part of the process by which this product improves and grows.

After a few hours use

I look forward to sharing any idea's that I have for Pebble in the hopes that it may help in the future.

So Thanks to all the guys on the pebble team for making this product a reality and sticking with it.

So I have had my black Pebble since early March. And it did have one minor incident in the beginning, battery life.

The functionality that the Pebble has is awesome as it is. And it will only get better as updates roll out and more developers get to working on producing apps for it. With Runkeeper out now and the plethora of watch faces, I am more than thrilled (even three months later) with how useful Pebble is. I keep my phone on silent 24/7 now since the vibrating motor in the Pebble is great. And since I see all my notifications from my phone on the watch, I get better battery life on my phone since I'm not constantly turning it on to see something. Functionality: √

Durability has surpassed my expectations tremendously. Before I got my Pebble, I have swam with it, I have been in the sand with it, I workout/ play tennis with it, sleep with it and everything in between. Perfectly fine Pebble. Durability: √

Lastly, turn the backlight off during the day and I think the watchface Simplicity has something to do with it because of how little animations it does. Battery life: √

Now I understand that there are going to be some faulty Pebbles out there, then thanks a lot. I just want to give a different perspective on the Pebble. :)",Review,False,self,t5_2txls,False,,

**FAQ:**

**Watch Band:** http://www.ebay.com/itm/261154299564?var=560178509863&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649

**Pebble Delivery Date:** February 9th

**Pebble Backer Number:** 7223 (On pebble box)

**Phone:** GSM Galaxy Nexus (rooted

**Usage:** Watch face is **text watch** with **backlight on auto** and 10-50 notifications a day. My backlight gets triggered a lot as well but a whole lot less with backlight on auto. 

**Impressions for daily use:**

**Pros:** Battery life since charging 4-5 times has increased from 4-5 days to about 5.7 to 6 days. It helps while driving (not only do I check my phone a lot less, I can stay on text watch and go check date with just 3 clicks. The fact that with a flick of my wrist I get a backlight is really handy. The watch has kept up with my daily use and the occasional knocks against wood, metal, drywall. I would highly suggest a screen protector as the watch face does scratch from daily use.

**Cons:** The paint on the metal magnets has come off (not a big deal, I liked the weight.) Maybe a way to add more weight to the watch in v2 (not the band, but the actual watch face.) 

**Small Stuff:** I wish I had applied a wet screen protector right the first time and held down all 4 corners of the watch for 5-10 minutes, even though my watch was synced with my phone it never switched until I reconnected it. Not a big issue cuz I assume the time only gets updated on the watch when connected to a phone (why would you want it any other way except during daylight savings, it would waste more battery life to constantly update the time.) 2 times since I have owned the pebble after receiving a gchat message the watch gets a white screen and starts vibrating for 30 seconds and then restarts and disconnects from my phone, I assume this is a small bug so not really a issue. 

**Chargers:** I bought this charger when I worked for **[best buy for $6](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dynex%26%23153%3B---Dual-USB-Universal-Wall-Charger/2525266.p?id=1218332540505&amp;skuId=2525266)** but thanks to ebay if you can wait a couple days get this **[life tech charger one for $10](http://www.ebay.com/itm/For-Navigon-2000-2100-2120-2300-2310-2400-Dual-USB-Home-Wall-Charger-w-Cable-/310640619194?pt=US_GPS_Chargers_Batteries&amp;hash=item48539faeba).** 2000 mah means 1000mah for each device plugged in and all in 1 port which means really fast charging to both my phone and pebble or my tablet/pebble/phone/kindle/ect.",self,t5_2txls,1364757123.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1bd55z/1_month_pebble_review_with_metal_strap/

The scratches were too deep for any conventional polishing techniques. I could try sanding it and then running it under a buffing wheel
The first lesson here is that

With that said

Petroleum jelly, and since the refractive index is matched, the light travels through it without bending or reflections, this makes the scratch invisible. I smeared some Vaseline over my Pebble, and the scratches disappeared. Great!

The next problem is that the Vaseline will rub off and wash off eventually, smear some Vaseline on it, apply the screen protector, and squeeze out any bubbles. Then let it sit still for an entire day or two. Make sure your hands are clean and no dust ever lands on it while doing this.

I highly recommend using [Gadget Wraps](http://www.gadgetwraps.com/devices/pebble-watch.html) for this, where the screen protector sits in, in the end, everything is perfectly smooth. This makes my method of hiding scratches much easier because the sticker traps the screen protector, making it easier to squish out the bubbles.

I have been thinking about cool uses for httpebble and things people might like to see quickly by looking at their watch. Someone the other day recommended that I make a Gas Finder so I went to work and created something I have already found useful for myself.

This watch app will easily allow you to find the closest &amp; cheapest gas station to your current location.

Launch the app and it will start searching for the closest gas station - when found it will display the station name

It will then start to search for the cheapest gas station in a 10 mile radius and display the same information on the bottom half of the watch.

Note: Requires httpebble to be installed on your device. Please choose the watch app that applies to your phone as the default one is for Android and there is an alternate iOS version due to the UUID used to communicate with httpebble on your device.

We created the concept of PebbleBarn because we noticed a gap in the Pebble appmosphere.  There were a few different places to download apps and watchfaces


PebbleBarn was developed to give developers the option of selling their apps to other Pebblers.  While we offer both free and paid apps


At first, along with a few of his other amazing games.  I'm a web developer by trade (and far from an attorney), and quite frankly the thought of trademarks/copyrights didn't cross my mind until it was too late.  We received plenty of backlash from the online community, and then we received email from a NAMCO attorney just a week or so after our launch instructing us to remove PacMan from the site. PacMan had to come down, but we're still hopeful that PocketScience can remake the game so it's not infringing on any trademarks.


We also had a developer who [released apps on MyPebbleFaces that linked to our site asking for payment](http://i.imgur.com/a6YQqqi.png).  This obviously caused some Pebblers to get upset when they tried to upgrade their existing apps from MPF, and we'll respond within 24 hours with the code.  


Now let's talk a little bit more about the site.  We get a lot of inquiries about why certain things are done differently than MyPebbleFaces (which


These are all good questions, they didn't want to sign up on the site.  We totally understand this, so we've made the user accounts optional.  The only downside to this is if the user removes the app from the site, they're then required to go into their email to find the original download when they first bought the app if they want to add it again.


As far as adding *free* products to your cart, in order for us to accurately track the number of downloads (which is usually an important thing for developers), all apps must go through the checkout process.  This can be a little awkward to ""checkout"" when the total value of your cart is $0, but obviously no payment details are required for this type of transaction.  You simply have to click the ""Checkout"" button once it's in your cart.  We can always add a big download button on each product page, but currently that would cause the developer loses visibility on the download count.  Some developers might care about this, others may not, but we're trying to keep each product page consistent.  Bottom line is we're still working through some of the ideas on how to best tackle free apps on the site.


For developers, everything can be filtered by product.  We pay a 70/30 commission, which is standard in most app stores, and we make payouts to the developers after every $25 in commissions received.  We're also in the early stages of creating a more robust edit page for developers who wish to update the version of the app, or change the verbiage of the description.


For what it's worth, not $2.99 as shown in the previous image).  Since then he's received his first payout and is working on the next $25.  It's not huge money, but so far it's proven to be better than just donation requests.


We've also been asked by several people if our site is sponsored or endorsed by Pebble.  The answer to this is no; however Eric Migicovsky has shown his support for PebbleBarn and our developers [in other ways](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/44914/#Comment_44914).  


I guess the bottom line is our ultimate goal is to just give developers another option for where they list their apps.  If you have an app that you think might be worth $.99 (or more) to others, too.  We know we're only as good as the developers who use our site, so the more the merrier.


Sorry this was a little longwinded

1363068588.0,1a4uhk,Possible answers to SDK/production silence,yY33rfX,36,8,48,"*I don't often post things anywhere on the internet, unless you count the black Pebble I pre-ordered on February 19

There are three main issues I have seen brought up repeatedly here

1. The current status of the SDK
2. Production being far slower than estimated
3. The schedule/order the Pebble colors will be produced in

Considering that the Pebble team is fairly open about most parts of the company, but instead you get complete silence, even as other questions get answered quickly.

Why? Well

1. They can't
2. They don't want to

Let's apply that thinking to this situation.

**They can't**

Maybe they simply don't know the answer. They can't tell you what they don't know. (*Example: They don't know the order or schedule of color production because production times have been so varied

Maybe they are legally prohibited from talking about what you are asking for. (*Example: They can't talk about the SDK right now due to temporary non-disclosure agreements with partners or hacker backers.*)

**They don't want to**

This is the biggie: They have determined that saying nothing is better than saying something. This could well be the answer to all of the questions met with silence. Let me run through some scenarios with you:

Scenario: Bad news: They've hit some major snags on the SDK, to say nothing of the app SDK. Production isn't nearly as fast as expected, and they have to (continue production at that factory anyway due to costs of changing factories/move to a new factory and delay things further in the hope that production can pick up). As for colors, (they can't get one or more colors to turn out right, and they need more time/they have been unable to get the right color material due to shortages or volume issues). Heck, they even underestimated the costs involved, and so things have to be slowed down to save enough money so they can survive.

* They come clean, are happy just to have the communication and content to wait for a good product. Other users become irate at the continued delays, possibly to the point of selling their Pebbles and posting negatively everywhere the Pebble is mentioned. I would guess that the irate users would massively outnumber the content ones in this case. The journalists will quickly pick up this piece of news and sharpen their talons. Before long, any tech/gadget news site out there that has mentioned or reviewed the Pebble in the past will be running the story about the even further slipped ship dates, broken promises, and silence leading up to it. Most places that talked about the Pebble were positive about it because of its potential, but seeing this latest stumble they may well become negative about it. Pre-order customers may simply decide to take their business elsewhere when the Pebble name is dragged through the mud, if it fails or falters their entire company could go down in flames.

* They could lie. The Pebble team could say that everything is actually going better than we think. Production and shipping numbers have been under-reported, this would all be discovered as a lie in short order. If you thought telling the truth was bad, the results of this would be even more devastating. Lying in this situation is beyond stupid.

* They could remain silent. Whenever asked about this, as if doing so will somehow compel a response. Others will post angrily wherever they frequent. However, as the Pebble team is hard at work on getting Pebbles out to backers and getting the software just right, they will eventually fulfill all of their backers' Pebbles and get the SDK out. People will be vaguely irritated that they didn't get any answers when they asked, but they will be happy with their Pebbles and the software that developers are now creating for it. Even the pre-orders will get their Pebbles, and then the Pebble enters the world of retail. With the kinks worked out and a happy userbase 100,000-ish strong even before retail availability

So, and possibly without an SDK to make things with either. That doesn't help anybody. Just cut them some slack and be patient for a while longer. They have a pretty good track record of answering questions and helping people, their silence here is obviously not malicious in nature.

tl;dr Silence on these questions is the best option for their business right now. It's also the best thing for Pebble owners,False,self,t5_2txls,False,,pebble-black,t3_1a4uhk

](http://i.imgur.com/n5JJQal.jpg)
A little over a week ago I left for a trip to Florida. I first flew down and didn't have any trouble getting through security with my Pebble. I wasn't required to take it off during the body scan (although the TSA agent asked for a quick look after I walked though). No problems while it was in the air either. I spent 7 days in Florida and the temperature was 80-90 and sunny most of the time. I didn't experience any discomfort wearing my pebble with the regular strap (I wear my Pebble fairly loose though). 5 of those days I went to the beach and never had any problem swimming in the saltwater or digging for shells in the sand. One problem I did find that's not totally related to the Pebble itself is that when applying spray on sunscreen the sunscreen stuck to my gadgetwrap skin and I haven't been able to clean it (it's only noticeable at certain angles. [Here you can see the specks.](http://i.imgur.com/DfaUqfw.jpg)) Over all my Pebble spent a lot of time in the hot sun and underwater in fresh and saltwater (saltwater mostly). I also charged it once during the trip. The hot sun didn't seem to affect battery life. One last thing I did notice was that I purchased a cheap pair of sunglasses that had some kind of filter on them (I don't know what it was) but it enhanced the LCD discoloration 10x anything I've seen before to the point where I couldn't read my Pebble. ([this picture was taken looking through them in my room light

All in all I'm very happy how my Pebble did over my trip

When things are still small and before success comes, and your CEO is heavily involved in the technology aspects of things.

But then success comes, because they're a great engineer at heart, but the press and the general public start expecting things (take away Pebble's Kickstarter updates, which are unusual for any company). It's hard to distance yourself from this thing you dreamed up in the shower or sitting on a barstool and are now on the verge of making a reality. So, you try to juggle the demands: spend as much time as you can getting your new product to market, let the new stuff fester. Eventually, you're doing a lot of things halfway decently

A savvy CEO recognizes this drain and hires a Product Manager to deliver the end product

The CEO will always wear multiple hats, programmer or designer, but when a company sees some big wins and starts getting lots of press the need for the CEO becomes sales, marketing, PR and the like.

I'm not saying a Product Manager would have had Pebble in all of our hands last September or would have fixed the color temperature issues

",4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1adtr1/bug_firmware_upgrades_are_broken_in_last_nights/,"Hey there, pebble-users.

Last night we published a bad version of PebbleOS v1.9.0
(normal_ev2_4_v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e.pbz) through our beta release
channel. This release contains a bug that breaks the data-transfer
protocol used to update the watch's firmware. Any users that are
running last night's beta release must reboot their Pebble into
""Recovery Mode"" before upgrading from the beta release of PebbleOS
v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e.

## How do I know if I'm running the affected firmware?

Navigate to the ""About"" screen (Settings &gt; About) and take note of the
displayed firmware version number. If your watch is running
'v1.9.0-rc2-24-g49bc60e'
bug only affects this particular version of the firmware
running any other version of the firmware (as of March 15
are not affected.

## Updating Your Watch Via Recovery Mode

You can update your watch from Recovery Mode by performing the
following steps:

1. Press and hold the Back
reboots and a ""Loading..."" message is displayed. This will take
approximately 15 seconds; if you let go of any button you will need to
start the process over.
2. Entering Recovery Mode will cause your Pebble to forget any
previously paired devices
un-pair/forget your Pebble before attempting to re-pair with your
Pebble.
3. Once you have re-paired your Pebble to your phone
Pebble app on your phone. The app should detect that an update is
available and prompt you to upgrade to v1.8.1. If your app does not
detect the v1.8.1 update
out of date. You can clear this cache by killing the app and
re-lauching it.
4. (Optional) There is a bug in the Recovery Firmware versions under
v1.5 that prevents the Pebble from restarting after the update has
succeeded. Once your handset displays an 'Update Complete' message
you'll need to manually reset your watch by pressing-and-holding the
Select button until the ""Pebble"" logo appears on the display. It is
very important that you let go of the Select button as soon as the
Pebble logo appears

I understand that it is not a serious competitor to Google now or siri. It is not supposed to be! After all it can't do things like setting a timer or do anything local on the phone. Yet. Thank you.*  

 I started this ""project"", but it turned out to be a lot of fun and for the past weeks I've been discovering all the awesomeness Wolframalpha is capable of.  

Long story short: I created a tasker profile/task that will answer your questions. The input is your voice

I've made a short video highlighting 3 possible questions and 2 errors that occur either if you ask something that Wolframalpha can't answer or if you don't answer fast enough. The ""hotword"" I use in this example is ""search"". You can use every hotword you like

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjn5iL0Y5lI I apologize for the quality...  
If you've never heard of Wolframalpha or want to know what else it is capable of

**Setup:**  
What you will need:  

* [Wolfram ID](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signup.html) You need to register as a developer to do this.  The APP-ID you will receive looks like this XXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX

* [Tasker ($2.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)  

* [Autovoice ($1.57)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autovoice.unlock)| To get familiar with AutoVoice

* [Pebble Notifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin) 
 
* [Pebble Tasker (optional) ($1.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodek.pebbletasker)  

* [Tasker Profile](http://torron.net/pebble/profile.prf.xml)| [QR Code](http://i.imgur.com/UysR4Il.png)  
Steps:  
 
*!Follow steps 1-13 below if you didn't download using the qr code!*  

1. Install all the apps. 
2. Download the profile.  
3. Navigate to the profile with your favorite file browser. I use [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop)  
4. Open the file with Tasker.  
5. Open Tasker and once the profile tab is selected click it again and then select Import and finally select the profile to import.
6. In Tasker click on the profile you just imported. Then click on ""GetResults""
7. Now go to 4. ""HTTP Get""
8. Under ""Path"" add the Wolfram ID you got from developer.wolframalpha.com right after &amp;appid=
9. Finally we need to make AutoVoice listen to what we say. To do this we create a task that launches continuous voice:
10. Create a new task  
11. Add an action. Go to Plugin-&gt;AutoVoiceContinuous  
12. Under Configuration click Edit and check the box.  
13. All that's left now is to launch the task we just created and then talk to your phone. I use PebbleTasker for this

*!Follow steps 1-12 below if you downloaded using the qr code!* 

1. Install all the apps. 
2. Download the profile.  
3. Open the file with Tasker.  
4. Open Tasker and once the profile tab is selected click it again and then select Import and then select the profile to import.  
5. In Tasker click on the profile you just imported. Then click on ""GetResults""  
6. Now go to 4. ""HTTP Get""  
7. Under ""Path"" add the Wolfram ID you got from developer.wolframalpha.com right after &amp;appid=  
8. Finally we need to make AutoVoice listen to what we say. To do this we create a task that launches continuous voice:

11. Under Configuration click Edit and check the box.  
12. All that's left now is to launch the task we just created and then talk to your phone. I use PebbleTasker for this

**Remember: If you set the pebble app to only forward notifications when the screen is off

**Tinkering**  

Feel free to tinker with all the settings and add/remove as much functionality as you want.  
To change the hotword I was talking about earlier
I decided to use:  

* ""search"" which worked best for me to be honest  

* ""I'm wondering"" For this one I was trying to create a seemless hotword: I imagined a dinner conversation at which a controversial topic is discussed and people seem to know different facts. Just as everyone is pulling their phones out to be able to google said fact

* ""OK pebble"" obligatory  

* ""okay pebble""  

**Limitations**  

* The continuous AV is still in beta and can eventually stop your microphone from working. A reboot fixes that problem.  

* One pebble notification is limited to 160 characters. I tried pushing a second notification

* A free WolframAlpha developer account is limited to 2000 queries a month. This doesn't sound like a lot

I'm a kickstarter backer with an orange one ordered. Just got some genuine questions.

Communication.
I'm wondering why there are not more updates on the project. I know so little about this project as a whole I'm left feeling as if I'm not part of the Pebble journey. It's a real shame. I'd bet if Eric had gotten funding from business investors, I don't see why we are any different, Pebble wouldn't of been made without either. It's not hard to take maybe 10 things that have been worked on in the last week and bang out an update. Anyway, I realise I'm covering old ground with this....so not much point, clearly falls on deaf ears.

The SDK.
I just saw in another post here (about the twitter thread being closed on the forum) Eric referred to the SDK as the Watchface SDK being the deliverable. People have interjected saying this is only a version of the SDK leading up to the full release of the SDK. I only see this as opinion, just honesty as to what I'll get in the end. ** This has been answered, thank you for pointing me in the right direction RichardGG**

Production.
Again, fine, at least I know. It comes back to my first point. I think, as an investor, I should be privy to production order at least. I'm not bothered you can play Snake on it....


These are not a personal attack on anyone. I'm just finally getting frustrated with what I think are simple things

If anyone has actual answers to any of my questions

Thanks.

1375520260.0,1jmahb,[Notice] Best Buy Watch Purchase Information,ZeroManArmy,27,6,7,"Hello fellow Pebblers! Some background

---

**First Off:** BestBuy.com sucks. The website stock is almost never accurate. If there is at least 1 item in the RSS (will get to that later) system the website will show that it is in stock. Even if the item was bought at 10:00am when the store opens. The site checks once a night and updates it's stock.

---

**Second:** There is a internal system that *all* employees can check. It's called **RSS**. This is the tool that updates roughly every 4 to 6 hours. Using this system will allow the employee to see all major stores in the area stock in one spot. This system uses the SKU number that is assigned to each item that Best Buy sales. From gift cards to 80"" Sharps TV's. 

This tool also shows **IF** the SKU you looked up may have some items being shipped to that store. Note' it can check other stores. It is not always accurate but can help you choose where to look next on the next shipment. 

---

**Third:** The store I worked at got it's shipments every Wednesday and Saturday. All stores are different and you should be able to check with a employee to see when the trucks come in. That is your best time to go in

---

**Last:** I will provide the SKU number for the Black and Red pebbles below. I would suggest calling your local Best Buy and asking the phone person to do a RSS Search on a specific SKU and ask if they or any nearby stores have the item in stock. If they don't ask them if there is a possible shipment on the way and an ETA.

I backed the Kickstarter project for the Pebble Watch.

After waiting, it ended up at my door mid May (though I had to pay customs to get it). I eagerly opened the box, took it out, got it started, and noticed the back light would not work. I tried everything possible, checked the support docs, and eventually contacted support through the app (May 14th), was asked to provide video proof (which I'm pretty sure isn't my responsibility

My ticket was then looked at

On May 24th, and I'd be told when the watch was being sent. 

And then I waited **4 weeks.**

Now, and twitter to which they eventually responded June 18th). Still silence. I followed that up with another email detailing my concerns given I was moving. They eventually got back to me stating that I should probably provide Pebble with a new address, meaning the RMAs were at _least_ 6 more weeks away. I provided the new address, and asked for an ETA.

They updated the address

It's gotten to the point now that even when I get the watch, and I've **waited over 7 weeks**, and still have no idea if or when my watch is going to show up.

I can't believe how badly they've opted to treat a backer of their product. It's depressing.

**TL;DR: Pebble sent me a broken watch, leaving me with a broken watch.**

**EDIT as of July 8th:** Pebble have gotten in contact with me since posting this thread (July 5th), but have yet to tell me when the RMA is going to be shipped.

As of yet

**EDIT as of July 9th:** Pebble have apparently shipped a new watch to my Canadian address (as I requested). I will report back when it arrives. I won't be able to check to see if it's in working order until August 2nd,False,self,t5_2txls,1373408688.0,,,t3_1hkixx

I checked my account and I definitely had the correctly address down. USPS is of virtually no help. Even though it shipped First Class with a tracking number

UPDATE: So good news. I called the post office this morning and spoke directly to the route driver. He didn't remember delivering any packages to my work address yesterday. He put me on hold for about 15 minutes while he searched for it. And thankfully

Apparently, but mark things as having been ""delivered"". Didn't really make sense to me. Even stranger, he couldn't explain why the delivered zip code showed as something different than my work address zip code. It didn't even match the post office zip code which is one number different.

In order... 
 
[LinesWatch](http://mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=295&amp;aName=Elzor&amp;pageTitle=LinesWatch&amp;auID=6) - If this was built
 
[MazeClock](http://mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=286&amp;aName=Elzor&amp;pageTitle=MazeClock&amp;auID=6) - More as a concept piece
 
[Simple](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=51&amp;aName=Fr0zone&amp;pageTitle=Simple&amp;auID=1) - If you hover over this you get an inverted image. It's this white on black design that I would like. As the title says
 
[Ziiiro Gravity](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=298&amp;aName=8a22a&amp;pageTitle=Ziiiro+Gravity&amp;auID=25) - A clean well designed watch face. More nice to look at than anything. Cool nonetheless.

* Stock timer &amp; stopwatch app; I know there are user made apps (which are great btw.) for these functions but unfortunately the occupy a watchface slot
* Option for watchfaces to save settings on the watch or ios/android app; It could be used for saving things like seconds hand yes/no
* Usage of accelerometer &amp; magnetometer; Why is it build in if it's not used for a compass app or something similar
* Better &amp; more complete ios app; Right now the app is pretty much useless; caller id won't work for me; the new email option worked once

Pebble has finally started offering replacement charging cables

I found some off-brand Pebble charging cables on E-Bay and decided to give it a shot. I still have my original charging cable

So here are the results:

- I payed $19.99 (the ""Buy Now"" price) with free shipping. The Pebble replacement cables will be $10 with shipping

- It took 5 days to get the cable (not business days

- The cable has worked perfectly so-far

- I can tell no difference in the magnetic strength of the charger heads (the part that adheres to the Pebble).

- You may be able to tell in the picture that there is a tiny difference in shape of the heads of the two cables. The non-brand cable does not fit as perfectly snug as the original pebble cable. This does not mean it is hard to get on or that it comes off

- Other than that

Personally I was willing to roll the dice regarding screen scratches on my Pebble

The protector is great: no discernible ""orange peel"" effect, it simply looks like a stock Pebble from the factory floor.  That door jamb incident did actually pull one corner of the protector off temporarily, and I'm happy to report that a little more installation solution immediately stuck it back in place with no adverse effects.  I got a few bubbles that appeared a few hours after the initial installation that took a good 5 days to disappear completely, so FYI.  If I have cause to test the waterproofing of the Skinomi protector, I'll certainly report back.

But I'm wondering if the folks who are *without* a protector want to weigh in.  I know that scratches are happening, **have they disappeared on their own?**  I have owned numerous plastic-faced watches over the years, and it seems that most of them are made from a plastic that tends to be not scratch-resistant, but rather, self-healing.  That is to say, the plastic has a certain malleable quality that removes blemishes over the course of normal wear.

If that is the case, and if the Pebble really does scratch--and stay scratched--as easily as it seems, then that's a whole other matter.

Of course,"" etc, by all means, feel free.",,False,self,False,t3_19g4vn

1361914862.0,19a82x,First charge cycle complete. Here's what I think. (spoiler: I'm quite happy with my new friend),Vlemert,23,7,16,"[Check my g+ album here!](https://plus.google.com/photos/102824102306658407395/albums/5849365809067625937)

**Let's first get the dates out of the way
Black pebble, mine was sent too. Never got a tracking email, ~~no clue which shipper~~ PostNL dropped it off at my doorstep, it arrived the 21st of february.

**Package:**
The watch arrived in the package we've all seen before. Seemed secure, and I switched it out.

**Platform:**
I'm on an old galaxy s I9000. It's currently running cyanogenmod 10.1 (android 4.2.1).

**Connecting:**
As soon as the pebble arrived

I also installed [Pebble Notifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kYXR0YXNtb29uLnBlYmJsZS5wbHVnaW4iXQ..) to be able to send any notification to the watch. App is doing a pretty good job at that too.

**Hardware:**
Pebble is not the most beautiful watch I've ever seen, it's not that tough. The watchface tends to scrats pretty easily, I've been extremely careful over the last 5 days and already have some microscratches on the surface (almost invisible, so no problem yet). I will be putting on a screen protector I bought from [bestskinsever](http://www.bestskinsever.com/) later this week to see how that goes.

**Screen:**
I really like the screen. In good lighting conditions it's very easy to read. The 'flick your wrist to turn on the backlight' trick is very nice in the dark. Tapping the watch to turn on the light hardly works, with one light source in front of me (pc screen). Flicking the wrist and looking directly at the watch solves the problem entirely.

**Battery life:**
I've only gone through one cycle (charged &gt; empty) so I don't know what it'll do in a few weeks, switching watchfaces multiple times a day (still can't choose). And I think the ton of notifications from whatsapp group chats don't help either. Overall, not too shabby. (I do avoid watchfaces that update by the second, don't trust 'em)

**Watch band:**
I suspected I would dislike the default rubber bands quite a lot, and I was right about the rubber bands (personal taste, wouldn't want them putting on something expensive I'd dislike too, so a cheap rubber band is actually perfect)

**Effects of owning a pebble:**
Having my phone out of my pocket is becoming less and less important. In the old days, and quickly decide if it's important or not. Already getting close to the point that I don't have a clue where my phone is. (other than within bluetooth range ofcourse).

**Verdict (so far):**
I'm really happy I backed this project back in april. You can't make a gadget freak happier than this. I hope to see the firmware updated sometime soon

**Update 27-02:**

*Pictures!*)
Added some more pictures to the album

*Taxes*)
As I said in the comments, so it could happen to pebblers too I guess.

*Watch band*)
The watch band is of pretty good quality
There was only one problem and that was that I couldn't get one of the screws out. I have pretty small wrists and wanted to take out the four optional shackles. Had to settle with taking out three. You can move the band up one hole in the clip thingy ([you can see this here](https://plus.google.com/photos/102824102306658407395/albums/5849365809067625937/5849683767668342354))

So, I expected it to be taxed (and it was the ""right"" thing).

So, the value of my package as printed in the invoice in the box was 2x90 + 5 = $185 US Dollars. 60% of that should be $110, which equals ~R$230 in local currency. Hefty sum, but again, around what I was expecting.

What wasn't my surprise when the post office guy informed me that it was charged for R$297! I then looked at the customs office invoice and lo and behold, that's right, EUROS, which amount to around 25% more than a dollar. That plus the $10 difference added R$70 to my tax, or around 30% more of what it should have been.

Now, contesting the value and attach extra proof that the value of the product is wrong. But there are some big catches with that:
1) You have to have extra proof. I had little in that sense except for my credit card bill from a year ago, so the final value would be more or less the same thing anyway.
2) You cannot get your package while they are processing the complaint. And they take LONG. Something like months usually.
3) While they are processing your request, even if your package is hold due to disputes, they will still charge you for keeping it in custody.
4) We don't really trust the post office enough to let valuable stuff like the pebble to rot there

So yeah, a friend of mine got a single Pebble and was taxed on about R$110, which is more correct. Mine just seems to have been inspected by someone in a really bad mood who wanted to screw me over, sadly.

Here are some pics of the Pebble box invoice and what the customs office thought about it.

(Note: the following are my personal beliefs and opinions

In no particular order:

* I got the black on black cookoo.  While it looks very cool

* It's a large watch.  Not everyone will like the size.

* Keep in mind that this watch is really two things: a plain, and a bluetooth transceiver connected to buttons, a beeper, a vibrator, and some indicators.

* Being an old-school analog watch, yes, I was fully aware of this limitation when I backed cookoo.  It's just that this is probably not something that most users would expect in an high-tech watch.)

* At the moment, Facebook message, calendar reminder, and low (iPhone) battery alarms.  However, I've yet to figure out how to get the calendar reminder to work.  The initial firmware has missing functionality, but I've had the calendar indicator activate multiple times.  I can't figure out how it activates, though.  Once, timer notifications are supposedly unimplemented (in the initial firmware), see next item).

* Note: a new version of the app has supposedly been submitted to the Apple store, better connections, alarm/timer indications, and music control.  I hope so, I feel the initial release leaves a lot to be desired, and the Apple store reviews of the initial release aren't exactly overwhelmingly positive.

* I don't know how well FB notifications work

* Going ""out of range"" does cause the phone to beep/vibrate multiple times (and this is the only situation -- that I've found -- where the phone seems to beep/vibrate multiple times).  If you stay out of range long enough

* The cookoo has a ""command"" button (lower-right button) that can do one of three different things, or long button press: FB checkin, find phone (make phone beep), or drop map pin.  You can choose which of these three things happen for each of the button press types.  You cannot configure any other actions.

* The ""make phone beep"" seems useful

* The ""drop map pin"" does work

* The app has a ""camera"" tab/button, you can press a button on the watch to take a picture.  While this might seem useful for remote camera operation, you must tap a button on the iPhone to ""confirm"" the picture, or it doesn't seem to be saved; pressing the button again seems to throw away the old snapshot and take a new one.

* The audio alert (like a peep) is quiet and short - around .1-.2 sec

* Vibrations seem to be short, or I'd miss them.

* Alerts generally peep and vibrate (once). However

Bottom line: while I like the look and styling, I don't think I'll like this watch -- I'll just miss most alerts because I won't hear/feel them.

I'm guessing that I'll like the pebble a lot more, this will depend upon the vibrating alert to be ""feelable"".  Does anyone know how strong the pebble's vibrator is, or how long it vibrates?

TL;DR: I don't think pebble has anything to worry about from the cookoo.

I've recently updated the website and wanted to give you an update as to why and what to expect.

The scope of the site has grown so much since the original so to accommodate this I had to re-write a lot of how the site handles new uploads etc and this would give me a chance to tweak the layout to try make it easier to browse and search.

It is easier for me to add new tags

From the feedback here a few things that have been reported 

* finding the search option - You can find this by tapping the search button as I thought it would de-clutter the main view but if you prefer it at the top like on the old site I can go back to that

* auto loading - Again I thought this would improve scrolling down a list but I can go back to the old way

* Grid view - one of the main comments regarding the old site was  increase the amount of watches to browse through them quicker which is why I opted for a grid view rather than the long vertical list

I'll admit that my strongest point isn't design and I'm more of a coder so any ideas on improving the usability and look of the site is seriously appreciated. 

Sorry for any confusion and the issues with Android devices not installing correctly.",self,t5_2txls,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1khfi9/my_pebble_faces_redesign/
1376356279.0,1k8wj4,German pebblers could use a little love,esaller,22,5,6,"**I am aware of the following official response from May 30
&gt; Shipments to Germany
&gt; First
&gt; Until we have final resolution with the authorities to clear all incoming shipments and release held shipments
&gt; In the meantime
&gt; We expect Pebbles will be flowing to Germany again soon and we will contact German backers with details as soon as we know more.

**I am aware of the following official response following my first inquiry from Jun 25

&gt; As of this writing

&gt; 1) Pebble deliveries to Germany will resume.

&gt; 2) We're a few weeks away from being able to make that announcement.

&gt; When issues in Germany got to a point where putting them on hold made sense

&gt; The time consuming part right now involves additional requests made of us by the German agencies our specialists are coordinating with. Fulfilling these requests involves us getting quotes from potential sub-contractors and setting up extra business presences within the country.

&gt; These last steps are causing the delay. Why? Because there are different routes we can take as a company to reach the same result (unimpeded Pebble deliveries to Germany). Part of the work being done now is weighing the different options

&gt; For Kickstarter orders to Germany

&gt; Non-Kickstarter orders to Germany will be similar to the fulfilment process for other ROW countries after shipments are cleared to resume

&gt; When German deliveries resume

&gt; * Getting Customs to release any Pebbles currently held in local offices.
&gt; * Reshipping any orders that were successfully returned to sender.
&gt; * Notifying our distribution centre that the orders we put on hold are green-lit for shipping.
&gt; Warranty replacement Pebbles to Germany are included in all of this


**I am aware of the following official response from Jul 11
&gt; Shipments to Germany are paused, the customs and technology bureaus banned backers from picking up their Pebble from the post office. Unfortunately, the bureaus did not contact Pebble directly, which caused quite a bit of confusion on our side because we saw thousands of Pebbles successfully ship through to backers in Germany, even while some backers were running into issues. Eventually, we were able to work with German backers and lawyers to figure out what was going wrong. We paused all shipments to Germany, leaving roughly 2, we’re getting closer to a solution and have been in email contact with any German backers who reach out to us at kickstarter@getpebble.com



As it seems only a direct approach can force an update regarding the German shipment situation.

The ""few"" weeks mentioned in your last update are now 1 month and 18 days (or 1 month and 2 days based on the Jul 11 update). You have again failed to provide updates (satisfying or not).

German communities like [german-pebblers](http://www.german-pebblers.de/) are on thread page 165 regarding shipment issues in their ""Shipment"" section. The essence of their post is that there is no answer regarding e-mails/support tickets or that there are no updates in general and the discussion has now shifted towards refunding the money.

The whole situation can be described as a sad state of affairs and some clarity would be appreciated.

I don't think it is and for these reasons.

2. The new box says it works with iOS and as we all know

3. Whitelisting Apps. One of the best apps is smartwatch+ on cydia and the developer has stated he has an Apple compliant version ready but no one has really let him know what to do next. It's the same with ismoothrun and runkeeper which still does not show speed for cyclists

I've recently became interested in Lucid Dreaming

The app would remind you to dream checks (at a user specified interval). Another optional feature would be reminding you to note down your dreams (at a user specified time).

Finally

It would be another incredibly basic WYSIWYG style

What do you think /r/pebble

Needed:

Icon designer (with portfolio) to create a simple and modern app icon

Translators from English to other languages. Just PM me with your skills and we'll go from there.

I'm not sure what's going on

**EDIT**: This post went through fine. I guess I was being a bit paranoid

My original post is quoted below:

&gt;Okay, I'm very upset with the way everything has turned out.
&gt;
&gt;I went into BB on Friday, I went home, excited to go in today and pick one up, thought about it all night, went to sleep.
&gt;
&gt;Saturday evening comes around, and I see pictures popping up from people who have picked up their pebbles already in store. Kind of upset, I figure at least my store will have them in stock tomorrow when I go pick it up. I forget about it again, and then I go out.
&gt;
&gt;I've been saving up for months, ""wait a minute, they only had three in stock... I hope they have more."" Finally I find someone who can help me. He has no idea what I'm talking about, so he goes to the desk where the first guy is, and the conversation goes something like this:
&gt;
&gt;* Man helping me: Do you know about a ""Pebble Smartwatch?""
&gt;* Woman at Mobile dept. desk: Yeah he has one *asks man sitting beside her* Where'd you get that?
&gt;* Man at Mobile dept desk: Oh I got this when they came out. We're sold out now.
&gt;
&gt;What the F.? So BB gets fined if a customer buys something before it comes out
&gt;
&gt;Now, but there is plenty they could have done to prevent this. What about making a deal with BB over the pre-orders. BB can take the pre-orders [for the black watches] and stock stores by zip, with a couple extra units in each area, holding on to the pre-orders until they're picked up by a certain date, at which point they would go on sale to the general public [including employees without pre-orders.] I'm sure this deal has been talked about for at least weeks, and I thought of that idea less than a minute after I walked out of the store. The people who pre-ordered black watches would have no reason to be upset, and they could order more units if they see the watches picked up by that date. If not
&gt;
&gt;All in all
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR: Waited with a pre-order [not pre-purchase] for months
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Added more detail about my interaction with the employee at the Mobile department desk.

There was also this reply to my original post:
&gt;If you want to blame someone, and said go find one at BB. They said the deal with BB would help with distribution but there is no way in hell BB would sign up for or even attempt to fill Pebble's preorders. Why would they want the headache? I don't blame their employees one bit for snagging them. If you had to work retail and deal with fantastic/sarcasm people everyday and one perk was getting at the merch ahead of time would you think twice about snagging stuff?

After 3 crashes it will go into safemode. Once you reconnect it to the iPhone it will prompt you to update the Pebble in the app to software version 1.9.1. Which is strange. Seems to downgrade your Pebble back to 1.9.0.

Can anyone confirm it does this on Android? You can try it since it doesn't actually boot to safemode until the third crash in a row.

Kind of scary since 1.9.1 was to fix the brick bug. Try at your own risk. Just wanted to get it out so it was addressed in the next software update.

""At the roundabout take the third exit towards London.""

The update would include an image of the junction from the map, time, ETA and other info. This would be great for Navigation Apps like Waze etc. as well as cycling apps.

I envisage this working similar to how Runkeeper works with Pebble - the watch display activates when you press start from the phone app.

Seemed like a good price

First impression - definitely not a quality piece.  However again I was not expecting the world for $15 shipped.  Had a few nicks on it out of the bag

Removing the pebble band wasn't hard after watching this [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfSIXjmbtrE).

Putting the new band on was pretty easy.  It included two spring loaded bars but I reused the pebble ones.  I put it on and found it too big and started the process of removing links.  You can remove up to two links.  There is also a one step adjustment within the clasp

So the challenge I am dealing with is that with the metal band (and I would presume any metal band, but at the same time more annoying due to the slight gap in some cases between watch and wrist.

At first I had two links out

PROBLEM: Excessive battery usage


Settings&gt; General&gt; Usage

Time since last full charge

Usage (This time is increasing despite being locked)

Standby (This time will match above time is the bug is occurring after a full charge)

 

TEMPORARY SOLUTION 1: Turn off Bluetooth
(Pairing with the Pebble will start the bug again.)

 

TEMPORARY SOLUTION 2: Forget Pebble, Re-pair with Pebble

 

CAUSE(?): I suspect this bug is related to the Bluetooth profile of the Pebble on iOS. When making a call or using Siri, I would like some other thoughts and opinions on the matter. Is it possible to look at a file which shows what Bluetooth services iOS is allowing the Pebble to use?
