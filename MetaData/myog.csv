Shoud i baffel ? its going to have about 1, or just more work ?

Should i do a foot box or just ad a strip of velcro so i can make the it if i need it. Im afraid the velcro might tear the fabric

Is it worth it in a summer quilt to ad a ""neck string"" like the [katabatic](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Reviews/Katabatic-Gear-Palisade) quilt has it.

Do you guys have attachment system to tie to quilt to the sleeping pad ? do you use it. is it needed on a summer quilt ?

1365389193.0,1bw61c,Troubleshooting Cat Food Alcohol Stove - Flames Up Pot Sides,birdsbirdsbirdsbirds,12,1,23,"Hey guys

I just made my first two cat food can alcohol stoves (AKA Fancy Feast stoves). I used the first two templates from the [Supercat Stove Page](http://www.supercatstove.com/docs/SuperCat_HolePunchTemplates.pdf) to punch the holes (one template for each stove). I used the Disney Aristocat's brand cat food

I've used two different pots with similar results. The first is an Open Country 2qt aluminum pot with lid. The other is a MSR Titan Tea Kettle with lid. Ostensibly the flames-up-sides problem is worse with the Titan kettle. Both pots are filled with 2 cups cold water and stoves have just over 1oz fuel.

My problem is that the flames from the stove tend to reach up the sides of whatever pot I'm using. My burn times are pretty similar between stoves: 9min for the one with fewer holes

*My guess would be the fuel isn't getting enough oxygen.* The stove with more holes burns longer and tends to have a more contained jet of flame - which makes me think fewer holes isn't getting enough air. Because most people using pots of both sizes (2L and 850ml) without this problem

**TLDR**; Cat Food stove has marginal performance and flames frequently lick up sides of pot regardless of pot size. My guess is air flow problem. Halp plz!

I have a nice late 80`s Buck 639v survival knife. After contacting BUCK and looking on ebay for a week i decided i would have to make my own sheath. 

Got the leather from a old leather coat that i picked up for 3 bucks from a thrift store. I choose it over 3 dollar leather boots because it was thinner. 

Cut the leather out with a knife and used a 10 dollar cheap-o rivet type squeeze gun to attach the circular rivets. Inserted a couple of rectangular pieces of craft knitting plastic for stiffness between the layers of leather. The backing is actually 2 pieces of leather with the strap piece and plastic in the middle. Same goes for the top cover over the blade. 

Sewn up with nylon saddle thread from the thrift store and coated with gorilla glue without adding water to the glue. Made a nice thick hard coat on the sheath and secured the nylon from being pulled off or fraying. 

I secure the strap with velcro. I have another piece of leather with huge snaps on it to add in the future as a 2nd strap for extra protection. 

The leather was really hard to sew. I used a finish nail at first to make the thread holes but eventually ended up getting a big ass needle and just forcing it thru. After stabbing my finger with the needle repeatedly i made a popsickle stick / gorilla glue thimble. =-)

I want the strips to be as form fitting to the natural shape of my foot as possible, so I'm going to position and cut all them appropriately. Around the perimeter of the trace Ill cut short rectangles ( wide end on the perimeter), again, to fit the curve of my foot best. These extra strips of sole are going to be where I anchor some sort of material to. 

Winter in Colorado is wet, rocks, whatever. I'd like the inner layer to be something warm....
Can anyone recommend a good materials for this?

If anyone is interested in hearing more
Right now I'm thinking that the best way to secure this to my foot is with parachute chord. Some how laced near the bottom of my toes up to my upper ankles. Water can seep into cracks
I'm going to hand sew everything together with some thick solid thread

a) What is the best material to use to make a frame bag?  Where should I purchase it?  I could go to a faberick store but there is nothing super close.  Something online would work or local could too.  Where do you by fabric?  What would you recommend?  

b) I also need zippers

Other info: 

 - I have a standard sewing machine that I borrowed from a friend.  I was thinking I will probably also need to get scissors, but will I need a special needle for the sewing machine?  
 - In Canada

Priorities for fabric: 

* Easy to work with -&gt; Maybe in the future I will make another one with a better or heavier fabric.  THis is my first sewing project so something easier would be good.  

* Waterproof

* Easy to clean - mountain biking = mud

* Durable 

* Non stretch fabric

* Other things I haven't thought of
