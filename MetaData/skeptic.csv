Their solution? Threaten legal action (seven figures in dollars), contact information for his employer and ominous threats of the type

After some discussion back and forth where the blogger tried to enquire which specific points on his blog they thought were incorrect

Gunnar Tjomlid [posted the story](http://tjomlid.com/?p=6650) about this whole ordeal in *details* on his blog ""unfiltered perception"" yesterday (the 26th) and from there it took off hitting [national news](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrk.no%2Fhelse-forbruk-og-livsstil%2F1.8222691) and crashing his blog a few times.

The original article that led to this situation has been shared a few thousand times via facebook

TL;DR: Chocolate thugs fail miserably in trying to bully skeptic blogger by threatening his family and career.

It's not all streetlights, just several per street as apparently the council still tries to maintains a certain light reading at all times. They are triggered by cars, and not pedestrians, hence why they have a habit of turning off while I'm walking near by. They probably turn off and on hundreds of times per night.

I was raised in a Christian household. When I moved out I encountered the real world



My mother asked me to talk to her pastor. I was at such a low I didn't fight it. It became a crutch for me during that time. It really is ridiculous when I look back because no god ever cured me of ppd. Medicine and postpartum therapy did (after baby #2). Yet I still clung to that belief system for a total of 3 years. 



Prior to this ""religious intervention"" I found myself drawn to ""natural living"". I think the idea of simplicity and control appealed to me during a time where things felt out of control. It was in this group that I became aware of the anti-vax movement. My oldest had received her first hep b in the hospital. I decided I was going to wait on the others and begged my husband to let me research before we did more. 



The problem with my ""research""  into vaccinations was that it really only served to fuel my already mounting PPD and fears. That is because it was full of fear mongering



As the clouds of my PPD started to lift I began to exam everything in my life. First on the agenda was Christianity. I left a Christian message board I was on in Dec. '10 and found reddit. I stumbled into r/atheism and felt like my memory had returned to me. All of the things I knew and understood before came flooding back and I felt like a giant moron. It was like my brain turned back on. 



From r/atheism I came to find r/skeptic. It was here that I started to examine my thoughts on homeopathy, read several studies and then promptly went and threw out all of my homeopathic voodoo. Again feeling like a complete moron.


Vaccines were the hardest for me to overcome. For some reason that one had taken the strongest hold of my worst fears. Someone in a thread here on vaccinations hit the nail on the head for me one day. He discussed the idea of being passively responsible for something happening to your child  vs. actively. In other words


Well


Thought I'd give you all a little insight into the mind of one of those crazy



So all of that to say thank you to Reddit for all of your informative articles

What's the deal with Activeion?

Activeion is the allegedly pseudoscientific cleaning product that Nye hawked a couple years ago. It was a special spray bottle whose inventors claimed would transform pure water so that it would clean better than regular water, and then transforms it by passing it through ""an ion exchange membrane, creating an oxygen-rich mixture of positive and negative nano-bubbles... The ionized water now attracts dirt like a magnet and lifts it from the surface, enabling it to be easily wiped away.""

An Activeion bottle cost anywhere from $169.00 per bottle to $329.00.

Nye starred in a video on their website explaining how it supposedly works and also sat on the company's board of directors (although it has been suggested that this may have been part of their endorsement agreement and not a formal directorial position).

Here's the video. See if anything he says makes scientific sense to you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAEArFmdd4

At some point, and their Twitter account is gone. But you can see what their site [once looked like](http://web.archive.org/web/20100410160522/http://www.activeion.com/science/default.aspx) via the Wayback Machine.

A [discussion at the Skepticblog](http://www.skepticblog.org/2010/04/22/bill-nye-selling-out-to-the-man/) suggests that Nye may have been in need of money

(That post also links to other sites with information about ""ionized water"" scams).

What I want to know is: what really happened? How did this man
Because I have to say, and I've tried. He seems to be back to doing good work, but I can't forget about Activeion. I want to see him as a hero in science education again, but I can't until I get some answers. We all make mistakes, and I could get past it, but I'd like to know if he considers this a mistake or the real deal.

Has anyone ever heard him talk about this? Does anyone know more about the story of Activeion and/or Nye's involvement?

My hypothesis is that my GF is prone to selection bias due to all the excessive marketing being thrown her way.

So I told her I would buy her ANY perfume she likes for xmas.   The only caveat was that she be blindfolded and that she pick according to the one she LIKED not the brand.

I would NOT inform her of the brand and would be replacing the bottle so she would never know.

If she picked THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE... I would buy it... If she picked the cheapest one.  I would buy that one.

She ended up buying one worth about $60 ... the prices ranges from about $40 to about $200 ... 

The one she WANTED was about $120-140 ... so I saved myself a nice chunk of change with this experiment!

This is my first post on reddit

I should start off with the backstory; a couple of months ago
As you can imagine
My flatmates have been in hell as well.

We've moved out since then and are finding a new life for ourselves

My best friend in the house has a mother who knows someone who ""contacted"" the girl

Obviously, cold reading, etc. I want to focus, however, on how emotionally fucked up this is.

This woman is using an unfalsifiable pile of claptrap on a situation which is very real and upset us in a very real way.
She may mean well and genuinely believe she's talking to her... but why is she anyway? 
Did she know her?
Is she affected by the death?

I don't believe in paranormal activity in the SLIGHTEST

What are your thoughts?

I have a large, you name it, we've got it.  All of my 6 sisters, as well as my step mother are firm believers in psychic mediums.  For as long as I can remember, they have gone for readings, and it has often been a hot topic of conversation at family get togethers.  I was a skeptic from any early age, and always thought that their beliefs were silly, three years ago

Now, I'm treated as a hostile element in an otherwise blissfully ignorant family.  I never thought that I would say this, but psychics are driving my family apart.

I get upset when they talk about what my dead father has allegedly been ""saying"" from beyond the grave when he ""comes though"" to them.  They get upset when I ask them not to talk about it around me.  I'm starting to feel like an alien.  Has anybody had a similar experience

TL;DR:  I'm a skeptic and my entire family believes strongly in psychic mediums.  It's staring to create tension because every time I see them

A lot of what I've noticed is people actively going about looking for fights about pseudoscience and alternative medicine. As [threetoast](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/w0pvo/got_banned_from_a_facebook_group_for_pointing_out/c59agog) pointed out

I know how frustrating it is to see people, our emotions take over and logic doesn't always prevail.

Instead of just criticizing what I've seen

* Make sure people know you're a skeptic
* Don't look for a fight
* Activism: It's a good thing if you do it right. Don't go around vandalizing products you don't like or picking fights on facebook. We need to make sure companies know it's not ok for them to sell alternative medicines that don't work
* Try to help people understand critical thinking and let the pieces fall into place. Give them resources or make them available. A realization that someone has on their own will be a lot more powerful than one they have because someone shouted it enough until they started to believe it.
* As a said above

I hope we can use this discussion to create a community that will really help us advance critical thinking. I know I could've written a lot more here

The Psychic Nikki segment starts at around 48 minutes into the show.

So far her excuses include

* Randi is using her for publicity
* Randi doesn't have a million dollars
* She has no interest in his money
* She has nothing to prove to him
* The test is controlled
* The test is somehow fraudulent or flawed
* Randi is a skeptic (yes that was one of her reasons to avoid the test and James Randi)
* Skeptics are losers
* She somehow thinks the challenge is for medians not psychics like her
* She has no time

She's gone on to make some bold predictions so far with her psychic abilities

* Randi might get ill.
* There will be an earthquake on the US East coast
* A big hurricane in Florida next year!!!!111!! Wowzers
* Ice caps will melt!
* [A large baseball field sized asteroid will pass by the Earth](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/)
* Packer fans will get married on a football field in uniform blah blah blah.

Mom doesn't know much about science mostly because she dropped out of high school in the 10th grade when she got pregnant with me. So naturally she finds a lot of things to be mystical/spiritual. She made an offhand comment last night about how it's strange that every year her birthday &amp; my birthday always fall on the same day of the week. So I tell her it's probably a pretty common thing &amp; that if any two dates are separated by a certain number of days that this will probably always happen.

Then the HYPOTHESIS: I tell her it probably comes down multiples of seven. That any time two dates are separated by a number of days that's a multiple of seven

Testing the Hypothesis: So we add up the number of days between her birthday &amp; mine &amp; it comes out to 42! (HA! Thank you Douglas Adams!)

Then came the title of my post and I say ""You see, contructed a hypothesis, tested the hypothesis and found it to be correct. That's science."" Then she asks me what a hypothesis is &amp; I give her a brief definition. I could tell she'd never heard these things before. I think she may have learned a little something &amp; that makes me very happy. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!

He asked me a few leading questions such as, so I played along.  He than continued to explain that ""all these problems and more can be fixed by wearing the Power-Balance Bracelet.""   I pretended to be excited.  He than asked me to balance on one foot and hold my arm out.  He than did the well known parlor trick of pushing on my arm and throwing me of my balance.  Next he had me put on one of his bracelets and repeat the test.  Wouldn't you know, this time he was unable to push my arm down, even with all his strength.  It was also at this time an audience started forming.  I acted very amazed and decided it was time for the trolling to begin.

I first asked him if his company had talked to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm?  Not sure what I was getting out he said no.  I then preceded explaining to him that his bracelet defied the laws of physics and thermodynamics and that the creator of such a bracelet should be rewarded a Nobel prize for such a ground breaking discovery.  

Confused he asked me

Another mall patron in the audience also chimed in saying that he heard it was a scam.  I than took the time to explain to the audience about applied kinesiology and the placebo effect.  The guy in the kiosk was quite upset with the whole ordeal and asked me to leave.  I obliged and was on my way.

Basically, she said I was wrong. Another student asked ""Wait, really?"" in response to the autism thing and she said ""Yeah, there have been studies."" Most of the class believed her. She has also spread other incorrect information around the class, such as the infamous ""blood is blue"" line, and the fairly forgivable and harmless yet still incorrect ""you eat 7 spiders in your sleep"" spiel. /r/skeptic, this is a college level anatomy course in a public high school. This shouldn't be happening. I'm 100% sure she would defend her beliefs if questioned about them and she will most likely promote the same thing next year as we spent a day on it.

I still have the packet, that's a shitty thing for a teacher to do. If we have to hire an attorney I guess that would be alright but I think an established corporation or what have you backing us up would be better than that. I am not afraid to put my name out there as I am a very well respected student but I'd rather let the people who know what they're doing handle it, you know?

A few examples for your consideration:

http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13edwx/nikola_tesla_free_energy/c73nb3b - this guy posted a massive essay defending 'free energy' without any real explanation of the science behind this 'theory'.

http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/12erm3/i_love_this_article_and_i_want_to_believe_its/c6v101a?context=9 - this guy. He seemed to get really offended when I suggested that a simulated universe does not require a creator or 'god'. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13edwx/nikola_tesla_free_energy/c73m7ym - this guy appears to trust the conspiracy theorists just because of the 'hundreds' of videos on Youtube.

Has anyone else noticed this? Or is it just me and my selective exposure to this subreddit?

Fresh water diatoms are used in the food grade DE. It’s around 97% AMORPHOUS silica… crystalline silica is the one that causes silicosis (and I believe must be regulated by OSHA). It is not FDA approved

&gt;DE has been used as a dewormer in livestock for sometime and is often supplemented in their feed

&gt;Silica is present as a trace

&gt;My only real concern regarding DE is a risk for kidney stones.

Astrology is BS... so I realized one way to drive people who believe in Astrology crazy is to ask them to guess my sign.

This was my first attempt.  Took her 11 guesses... out of 12 (obviously).

Another fun test would be to take an astrology chart for the day, ask her to pick one which she thinks applies to her.  Then at the end of the day we BOTH unblind each other and figure out how right she was.

She should quickly average 1/12.

A quick cop out here is to say ""well astrology is outside science"" which is BS... the whole POINT of it is to give you a heads up.  It is isn't observable it's as valuable as randomness.

Then last year, and recommended I go and get a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day, and I mentioned in passing ""oh yeah, I've heard Dr. Oz say that."". This caused my doctor to give me a bit of a dirty look, along with a ""yes, and now I'm saying it."". 

It bothered me a little that she would have that reaction, or was her derision directed toward Dr. Oz himself?

From that point, I began to notice things.  Like how much homeopathic material was presented, like how expensive all the ""superfoods"" he was recommending are on supermarket shelves, like how he had John Edward on his show, and became ""convinced"" there was something to what he did.

Yesterday, and it was apparent by the fact that both parties seem to consider different definitions, and 2) Oz was acting as a moderator, but at the end of the segment it was obvious that he had his mind made up before the debate, and was giving advice about ""addictive foods"" by the end of the show.

This man is a medical doctor!  Aren't doctors supposed to be critical and science-minded?  Does he actually think like this
