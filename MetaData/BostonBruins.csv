The news that broke this morning was fantastic. I myself

However, the fans, were taken for granted.

This is why I'd like to invite all of you who plan on attending games to do the following:


**DO NOT**: Eat, the beer isn't all that great and it's all grossly overpriced. Need a jersey? Buy one online from these Chinese sweatshops like I do. Make sure that the only thing you spend money on is the bare minimum: essentially it should be your ticket. That's it.

INSTEAD

**DO**: Drink and eat around the TD Garden prior to and/or after games and don't forget to leave generous tips to the people who have been longing the return of hockey in town. Those people haven't taken us customers for granted - There's plenty of options around the Garden and on Cambridge Street.

However, but in the grand scheme of life, they're meaningless)

And I realize that that first Bruins game after the bombings was an awesome event that helped heal the city

People get upset by the ""Toronto Stronger"" and ""Chicago Stronger"" shit, of course some jackass fan from the other team will use it towards their team, because they probably don't even realizethe impact of that phrase anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to justify that shit, it's terrible and disrespectful. I'm just not surprised by it.

I just wish people would understand that by using that phrase to describe menial crap

End rant

TL:DR - Love ""Boston Strong"" but using it to describe sports teams waters down the significance of it.",self,t5_2rmt9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonBruins/comments/1gc8lb/my_issue_with_boston_strong/

-Their sidebar is filled with good UPDATED content.

Game threads
-they have updated scores, fuckin stories! why dont we have shit like that. That'd be cool.

Links
-how many times have i been on here and seen the comment ""anyone have a link?"" they have them all set up. all you do is click ""Game Streams""


Seems these mods dont really give a shit. Maybe they dont have time.. thats fine. Can we elecet new mods?
Im not saying we should copy other teams
lol... like look at our sidebar.


Im not saying we need these things. I can look up all this shit if i want. But im on here all the time now (especially during playoffs) mostly to socialize and read what everyones posting. But theres room for improvement. 

thoughts?

does anyone really care? aha

#### Summary

**Big Story:** 
The Bruins begin their defense of the 2011 Stanley Cup championship

**The Hotness:**
 Alex Ovechkin had the lowest point total and second-worst goal total of his career

**Injury Report:**
Holtby is expected to start Game 1 for the Capitals because Tomas Vokoun (groin) and Neuvirth (lower body) are not expected to be available. Neuvirth might be able to go later in this round; Vokoun's return is less certain. … The Bruins announced Wednesday that right wing Nathan Horton will not be available this postseason because of a concussion. Defenseman Adam McQuaid and backup goaltender Tuukka Rask are also both likely out for Game 1

*****  
  
#### Stat Pack
Stat Pack: Boston's ""second line"" became the team's top line over the course of the season. Bergeron, which trailed only Pittsburgh's trio of Evgeni Malkin, James Neal and Chris Kunitz (96 points) and Detroit's trio of Henrik Zetterberg, Valtteri Filppula and Jiri Hudler (103 points).

Shortly after that exchange, Chris went out of his way to get him a puck by throwing it lightly over the glass, the first attempt missed and he did it again...

It is with great pride and excitement I write to you, difficult at times, but one that I have truly enjoyed each and every day. We have made great strides as an organization in recent years both on and off the ice. But having said that, we understand much more progress can be made, and much more progress needs to be made if we are able to meet our ultimate objectives. As President, I embrace these challenges that lie ahead and eagerly look forward to taking this organization to new heights.

I know first-hand the passion Bruins fans possess, possess. I experienced it every time I stepped on to the Garden ice during my playing days and I've experienced it at every game I've attended since. I know what it's like for a player to skate in front of a packed house and how much that helps you perform better when you are out there. To see the fan base grow over the last few years and see us regain that true home ice advantage again has been exciting for me. The atmosphere during our home games has been electric at times and that is a credit to you, our season ticket holders, for making our building one of the loudest in the entire league.

I also have a good understanding of your expectations of the players that play here and the expectations of the team in general. We want players that are hard working, like next week's draft and opening the regular season in Prague.

However

As a player, even today. But I am thrilled where I am now, with the opportunity to help bring the Cup back to Boston as the team's President. Know that the commitment is there from ownership, from our management and from myself, that we will do everything we possibly can to make that a reality.

Best regards

My friend and I purchased tickets around 3 pm yesterday for 60 bucks a pop. We sat in the balcony Sec. 308 in row 7. Really great seats where the Bruins shot twice. The 1st period comes and goes and my buddy recommends we go meet his friend who has box seats. We pick up our things go and I'm stoked as it is. We basically paid 60 bucks for $250+ seats. However, etc.). I didn't want to be rude and ask how they knew them so I kind of just nodded and carried on with conversation. The game continues and ends and after we leave I asked my friend who they were. As it turns out I was sitting in the Assistant General Manager's personal luxury box without even knowing it.
