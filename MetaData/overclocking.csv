1340598455.0,vk25i,Simplified Guide to Ivy Bridge Overclocking,RLutz,91,18,70,"I'll preface this by saying this won't be the most in depth guide on Ivy Bridge overclocking

To start

* [Prime95](http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/) - The bread and butter of CPU stability testing. Nothing beats Prime95 for verifying stability.

* [Intel Burn Test](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Benchmarks/IntelBurnTest.shtml) - Used to generate maximum possible heat in a short period of time; will generally get a CPU core 5C+ hotter than Prime95.

* [RealTemp](http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/) - Used to monitor your CPU temperature.

* [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Used to monitor VCore.

Alright

* Start by turning on Load Line Calibration (LLC). I recommend a setting of 50% LLC. 

The purpose of LLC is to combat ""vdroop"" which is the phenomenon that occurs when your CPU goes under load, your CPU will become unstable. LLC combats this by delivering additional voltage once it detects your CPU voltage starting to droop. The reason we want to set it to 50% and not 100% is because setting it too high can be a bit dangerous, because LLC is not instantaneous. As the CPU goes under load, voltage droops, and LLC delivers additional voltage to compensate, but what happens when your CPU goes from being at 100% load to 0%? LLC can't react instantly, so you get a brief moment of significant overvoltage

* Turn on ""offset"" overclocking.

Offset overclocking is much more desirable than static voltage settings and really shines when paired with LLC. Offset overclocking allows you to specify how much additional voltage the motherboard should deliver to the CPU once the CPU goes under load. To start with, you will drop down to 1.250v or so, but if instead you utilize an offset, you can keep voltage right around 1.300v.

* Disable all C-States.

~~If you get a high enough multiplier and offset, so the two cores will receive insufficient voltage and won't be stable. By disabling all C-states you prevent the CPU from entering hybrid sleep states, which will keep the voltages and multipliers locked. Note, this will increase power consumption a bit, but it will not disable the thermal safety protections built into your CPU, so don't worry.~~ Originally I recommended to disable all C-States (thus locking your multiplier and voltages), but really I suppose it'd be smarter to only do this if you actually run into problems. If your system seems 100% stable in a fully threaded Prime95, the problem might be related to C-States. A lightly threaded load won't peg all the cores so the offset voltages delivered won't be high enough to actually keep a single fully-loaded core stable. If you have these symptoms

**Alright

Time to start overclocking! Start by setting your multiplier to 40 (that should be a nice safe starting point) and leave your voltage offset at 0.000v. Boot into Windows and fire up RealTemp, and the Windows Event Viewer.

* **Finding your max multiplier**

Set Prime95 to run with the [following settings](http://i.imgur.com/zTdbZ.png) (use 8 threads if you have an i7 instead of an i5) and fire it up. Monitor your temps in RealTemp and make sure they stay below 85C while periodically refreshing the Windows Event Viewer looking for [WHEA Error 19](http://i.imgur.com/zmavm.png) and watching for errors in Prime95. WHEA Error 19 is triggered whenever the CPU makes a calculation error (but is able to catch it and fix it). A single WHEA error 19 means you are not stable, followed by another miscalculation that verified that the incorrect bit was actually correct).

After 5-10 minutes if your temps are okay (below 85C), restart, bump your multiplier up by 1 and repeat. Continue to do this until one of the following things happens:

* Your system becomes too hot (more than 85C under load). If this happens

* Your voltages become too high (above 1.300v [conservative] 1.350v [riskier]). If this happens, and skip to the last section of this guide.

* Your system becomes unstable (this will happen often while we are determining the max speed your CPU is capable of). BSoD, and WHEA Error 19 all indicate a system that isn't stable. Your options to fix this are either to deliver more voltage, cool the CPU more, or lower the frequency. Seeing as how you've already bought your cooler, and we're trying to increase the frequency, that means it's time to start increasing voltages. Restart, bump your offset by .005v and repeat the process. If you can get stable within good bounds, which means it's time to drop the multi (and voltage settings) back 1 notch and get ready to wrap everything up!

**Finalizing everything**

If you've gotten to here, we're going to want to take the time to be extra-sure we've got everything in tip-top shape. The good news is, we don't have to learn anything new here, we're just going to make extra-sure that we're stable.

Fire up your usual overclocking software suite, but make sure your temps don't get too high. If they do, unfortunately you're going to have to roll back the multi by another tick and try again. Note, IBT will get your CPU hotter than Prime by a good bit, so I'm somewhat okay with allowing temps up to ~87C or so here, maybe even close to 90C since it's unlikely anything else you do will get the CPU this hot. It's still a great test though, since it's a hedge against hotter room temps, etc.

If you successfully pass 5 runs of 10 IBT iterations, we're going to let it go for 8 hours+. Again, if you see errors in Prime or WHEA errors, time to deliver more voltages (again, temps must remain good, otherwise the multi needs to be lowered by an additional notch).

If you pass all your IBT runs and Prime95 runs

**Final Notes**

Q: *Is prime95 testing really necessary? My buddy says his system is ""game stable

A: I vehemently disagree with your buddy, ""I only rarely experience game crashes, and I don't care that much about my data.""

A single WHEA error 19 or Prime95 error is just a crash waiting to happen. Sure, why in the world would you risk an unstable system for an extra 100 Mhz? The difference between 4400 Mhz and 4500 Mhz is less than 3%, and the actual in game performance increase from that jump will be even less than that. Unless you're trying to set records or show off your e-peen, there's simply no reason to risk any amount of instability for such a marginal increase in performance. Sorry to get so preachy, I mean, it's your hardware, in the end you should absolutely do what you want with it, but not Prime""

I hope you found this guide helpful

This is applicable for any CPU

Basically, load event viewer, and be on the look out for WHEA 19 errors. A single one of these turning up means your CPU is not stable.

So what I will do is, fire up prime 95, click maximum heat torture test but then switch to custom and change the time each FFT setting runs at from 15 minutes to 1 minute (your goal here is to just cycle through all the different FFT sizes relatively quickly), and then start the torture test. If you aren't stable, you're going to quickly see WHEA errors, even well before Prime95 ever reports an error (because it's entirely possible that your CPU makes an error that it then corrects which prime will never see).

I'll typically let that run for an hour or so

You might think that these WHEA errors aren't worth caring about, these WHEA errors greatly decrease your actual performance (At 4.4 Ghz when I thought I was 'stable' but still getting WHEA errors, IBT would report my GFLops around 108-109, but once I gave the CPU enough volts that I removed all WHEA errors, I was consistently at 111-112 GFlops in IBT--this is because each time your processor has a parity error it needs to rerun its calculations). Moreover, a single WHEA error is just a crash or actual error that you just got lucky on.

Think of it like this, but it doesn't know which answer is correct, so it reruns the calculation. But if your system isn't stable (getting WHEA errors) then all it takes is 2 incorrect calculations in a row for things to go terribly wrong (2+2 = 5,  and the parity agrees!).

**TL;DR:** Fast cycling FFT sizes in the newest prime95 (1-2 minute runs) while watching for WHEA errors in your event viewer is going to be more accurate than a 12 hour+ prime95 run,False,self,t5_2rfc8,1337868186.0,,intel,t3_u2bwq

On to the fix. My processor was definitely getting hot; it was topping out at 70C, I removed my Zalman CPU cooler, cleaned it, re-applied the AS5 paste, and reseated it. I had my PC on the floor on its side, side cover off, facing me so I could make sure all the fans were working

I powered it on, but maybe it doesn't come on right after power on and waits until it detects a little heat to kick on.

So I waited about 30 seconds or so; I had gone into the BIOS to check my CPU temps before I booted. What the hell....so I reached down and gave it a little kickstart, then stopped....rinse and repeat.

Fast forward to about an hour later, and I'm sitting there screwing a 60mm case fan onto the base of my heatsink.

I have already hit 5GHz sub 70 degrees. But it's not fine tuned enough to show off. Give me a day or so to lower the volts while maintaining stability and test.
 
 
**Setup:**

* Cooler: Corsair H100 with two Scythe AP-15 (push)
* CPU: Ivy Bridge 3770k
* CPU TIM: Tuniq TX-4
* CPU IHS TIM: Coollaboratory Liquid PRO
* Lapping: Both H100 and CPU IHS have been lapped to mirror copper.
 
 
**Results:**

Unless you are doing rendering, you really should disable Hyper-threading. Not many modern applications make good use of HT technology, aside from programs like what I said just above, and even then it seems to be hit or miss. I do a lot of After Effects work, and having 12 threads does help when I'm rendering. However, when I am gaming or doing any other work (Photoshop for example), the HT doesn't give me any kind of a performance boost. What it does do is increase my CPU temps by 16C and put extra stress on my OC.

1355378722.0,14rtmj,560 Ti OC over 1GHz on air. Trying to overcome OCP protection and Nvidia driver limits. Looking for expertise...,dieselphiend,14,4,3,"I have an MSI N560 Ti Hawk that I think just may be a so-called golden chip. It OC's to 1GHz @ stock voltage without exceeding 62c max. With Nvidia 3xx series drivers it will not exceed 1GHz no matter what I try. Nvidiainspector and locked P states does nothing. It will say it's OC'ed to my desired frequency above 1GHz

If I install driver version 296.10, I tried 1014MHz, and it OC'ed perfectly, but... Within 30 seconds of testing in Skyrim the game would freeze and down-clock back to the factory overclock of 950MHz. I tried this several times, and it always reverted back to the stock OC after hitting 60c degrees.

This led me to believe it was related to overcurrent (OCP) protection. The more heat produced by the chip

Luckily, so, I disabled it. Now, I can OC past 1000MHz. So far, I've been successful with 1025MHz @ 1.025v. It does not exceed 64c, and it does not scale back. Anything beyond that and it only runs for 30 or so seconds and scales back. I've tried as high as 1.087v, and it still scales back. It almost seems as though there is a secondary, and really annoying. 

What's even worse is the 296.10 drivers. They absolutely suck in comparison to the 3xx series which make Skyrim look, but their limitations totally suck. I've looked into bios editing, but from what I've read, the 3xx drivers are able to override any core clock bios changes. I'm now considering trying to find the values from the drivers running in the memory with a hex editor, and freezing them in place, but it's been years since I used a hex editor, and I've only ever hacked games with them. Another possible option would be to find the values in Nvidiainspector and freeze them.

Anyone have any ideas?

Using HWMonitor and SpeedFan, and that was reporting much, much higher temps, around 60 or higher. Using RealTemp, temps held at mid to high 60s under Prime95 while SpeedFan showed 39. This is under my current OC of 3.8.

It seems that 900/1300 is a good stable point for me. With the errors occurring at a core clock as close as 915, even with all cards being uniquely different in terms of overclocking potential: How is it that I am so far what most can do without any voltage tweaking (e.g. 1050/1550)? I can only really go 20 MHz past my card's stock core clocks, which seems ridiculously low. Further, though, it also seems weird that even though I can barely push my clock speeds (core/memory) any great length past stock, I obtain scores far higher than shown in guides regarding this card when they would overclock it to 1000+ MHz core/1500+ memory and with voltage increases as well.

It successfully posts with 1.410vid @48 but is unstable. I have been very interested in offset clocking lately so I will go over my settings real quick. I currently am running the cores at 48,46,44,44 (1-6 core depending on the ratio) ie 2 cores only gives me 48 multiplier, if I'm using all 6 cores then it throttles down to 44. I do this mostly because 2 of my cores seem to run much hotter than the other 4. I am using these settings with a .150 offset with the CPU Load Line Calibration set to high. CPU current capability set to 130%, VCCSA Load line at High with the VCCSA current capability set to 110%, Tprobe is enabled with phase control set to 'optimized'.

So yesterday, and 4.6 was stable at 1.360. However, when I tried to go for 4.7, I had to raise the voltage to 1.380 to boot, and I ran Prime95 for an hour, 15 minutes of IntelBurnTest, and then two hours of Prime95 before it BSOD'd. I tried it at 1.385, and that ran Prime95 all night.

Temperatures were at most 60 at 4.5, Prime pushed it to 65, and IntelBurnTest had it up to 75 on some cores. After leaving the 4.6/1.355 running all night, temperatures were 60-65 across the cores. 

So here are my questions. First, voltage stayed at what I set it to, as did frequency. I've heard that may be because it's an MSI motherboard, so what would you recommend doing about that? Is there any workaround?

My real question is this, I thought that to truly have a stable overclock you should be able to run a CPU stress test, Prime95 in my case, and also some kind of GPU benchmark, like Unigine Heaven. After about 12 hours of stable prime95 I loaded up Unigine and something surprised me, I was only getting about 15-20 fps when I am usually well over 80fps. This is with all settings on max, 1920x1200 res, etc. I have 2 EVGA GTX 680 in SLI. I will post pics later if necessary but I am currently at work.

* I heard out about overclocking using offset CPU voltages, but it's running on a fixed CPU voltage) but I would like to do it with the 3570k because I want to manage heat/noise levels as well as not be too hard on the CPU itself.
* I'm considering getting an Asus P8Z77-V LK motherboard to go with the 3570k. Is this motherboard capable of the type of overclocking I have in mind?

It successfully boots

I understand that the next step is to bump up my Vcore until it passes the stress test

Is this normal? I would've expected to get more than 10 Hz FSB before needing to increase the Vcore. Is it possible that my CPU is damaged or some other factor is affecting this?

I'm going to say this now- I'm very new to this. I've been doing a lot of reading but following most of the info I do get confused at times. I've been trying to follow with the calculations

I'll start off with some detailed information.

I'm currently using the EVGA x58 SLI 132-BL-E758  
Intel Core i7 920 Bloomfield Socket 1366 LGA Revision C0/C1  
Memory is 24gb Kingston Hyper X Blu KHX1600C10D3B1K2
The Memory timings for these cards are here in the spd  http://imgur.com/a/X3CKh

Now from what I understand,7,7,20- but should I be changing that depending on my memory frequency?

I get into CPU VTT and Vdimm. It's suggested I try to aim for CPU VTT to be no less than 0.45v of Vdimm. Vdimm on my setup is at 1.500 from the memory specs

My default vcore is 1.26875V. Reading about the safety features I have an option of using Vdroop I can apparently just set this to auto. It will help with high strain voltages- however idle voltages will be higher than if I manually set my vcore lower
So moving back to CPU VTT- I should start at something simple like 1.3v
Now with turbo mode, so I might change the multiplier to something else with turbo off. People have been suggesting 19x or 21x for best stability. I will stay at 20x with turbo on for now, and I can always play with settings later.

I may also turn HT off for now- just to get stable readings.

CPU Uncore should be set to 2x my DRAM Ratio. I’m not sure what my memory settings are at this point- but I believe it runs the frequency at 2:8 be default

Then I simply play with the cpu host frequency to get a small increase in speed. I’m aiming for something around 3.2-3.4 just to start playing with stability.

I can always aim for lower voltages and better speed and move onto memory first- but I want to make sure I’m able to maintain stability at this junction before introducing different sources of instability.

I think this is the right way to go about it at least- let me know if I have anything wrong and if you guys are able to help me identify the proper memory timings.

I have one question for you guys. I know about the feature of my MoBo where my CPU Vcore drops when my rig is in idle to save power. My Vcore does drop to around 1.0xx - 1.1xx. My Multiplier also changes from 42 to 16. However, will the constant change of multiplier harm or wear off my CPU faster?

**First off** my CPU 

**The stock** speed is 3.1Ghz for a grand total of a 1.7Ghz overclock.

**I have** it stable at 4.7Ghz@1.45v (temps are 49c-51c running prime 95)but the benchmarks linked are with it at 4.8@1.5v I am not sure how stable it is at 4.8Ghz because the vrm were burning hot and I did not want to turn the voltage up anymore. But I did get to run prime 95 at 4.8@1.5v for around 10min and it never crashed. 

**Second my** GPU

**I have** my 7950 overclocked to 1150Mhz@1250mV with the memory at 1450Mhz@stock.

The inital goal here was to get the memory up to 1066. I followed the steps listed here for the OC: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/264508-30-ep45-ud3p-gskill-ddr2-1066-problem#4144685

The primary BIOS changes are:

* CPU Host Frequency (Mhz) to ""401""
* (G)MCH Frequency Latch to ""400""
* System Memory Multiplier (SPD) to ""2.66 D""
* CPU Vcore to ""1.3250V""
* MCH Core to 1.200V""
* DRAM Voltage to ""2.100V""

The result is 3.6Ghz on the CPU and 533Mhz per memory channel. I put some load on it for about 1hr and things seemed completely fine.

I noticed that when at load the CPU is pulling 77 watts. I'm assuming the reason for this is that I did not increase the maximum turboboost wattage and amperage.

Then I tried around and found that it worked using EVGA, that was actually a factory locked ""boost speed"" (the standard core clock is 835 mhz) and though it did give me a higher result in Heaven (about 3 fps higher on average), it wasn't true overclocking. I booted up Saints Row 3 to test if it gave a considerable rise in fps there, and suddenly I noticed I had raised 7-10fps on ultra. Checking the core speed, I saw it was at 1066mhz, the desired +116. Heaven showed promising results, about the same rise according to the framerate counter

Hope someone can tell me if this is bad or not.

TL;DR Attempting overclock i7 3770k first time. Seems stable

Edit 1: I just noticed that Core voltage is jumping a bit. It goes anywhere from 1.168 to about 1.25 something.Not sure if this is crucial to temps.

Edit 2: Someone notified me that i was on offset mode and advised me to go to manual mode and turn down voltage. I'm now booted into windows at 1.3v (as opposed to the previous 1.35v)


Edit 3: I'm not going to lie/hide it. Honestly 

Edit 4: I don't know why, 3, 4, but 75 on core 2. I dont know if this is odd. Unfortunately, however, i got a BSOD within 5 minutes. I read online that code 3b suggests to increase the vcore. Should i got to 1.26v? I might reapply thermal paste tomorrow. Is 60-80c in prime95 bad, good

UPDATE:
Prime95 test @4.5ghz vcore 1.26v no crash for 10 minutes. Max temps 67, 70. I read ivy bridge can run a bit high at times? Is this is a stable overclock? :D I'm starting to get the hang of this i think.

There's one bit that's really unclear to me at the end (page 3)... It says if there were no boot problems or BSOD errors, ""Continue these two steps until you are at the clock speed you want, within the required voltage settings, and aren’t going over 90C."" So my misunderstanding here is whether or not ""these two steps"" includes ""First, set your VCC offset to +0.005v if you’re using offset, or set the VCC voltage to 0.005v higher than stock if you’re using fixed,"" as I plan on using offset.

At what point do I further increase VCC offset? Any suggestions past what the guide gave me? What should I aim for? I've seen people commonly post within 4.2 - 4.4 GHz stable overclocks for the i5 3570k - can I achieve that? What voltages would that entail? How do I know if the voltage is too high for the current overclock?

So is 1.165V what it is at 3.4GHz and 0.685V is when it's underclocked? Why does it go up to 1.28V though? I would have guessed it would have gone to 1.170V (1.165V + 0.005V from the dynamic Vcore).

1345057271.0,y9xfx,[Mini-Review] XSPC Raystorm 3570k + GTX 670 waterblocks,smefeman,6,2,3,"**Intel XSPC Raystorm Waterblock**

I decided to pick this up to replace an old Danger Den TDX that was not performing while overclocking my i5 3570k.  According to a couple sites ([MLL](http://martinsliquidlab.org) and [Pure Overclock](http://www.pureoverclock.com/Review-detail/xspc-raystorm-cpu-water-block/) the Raystorm performs similarly to other top line blocks but at a lower cost.  I was able to purchase the Intel version from [Performance PC's](http://www.performance-pcs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=32331) for $50 USD.  This is pretty cheap as most other blocks will run at least $75.


*Performance*


Upgrading from an old Danger Den TDX (for single/dual core) I was able to shave off about 10C.  Currently


*Features*


The mounting solution is easy to use and seems well made.  It consists of a low profile metal backplate to secure the mounting screws and springs. Included in the Intel package are backplates for the 2011/1366


**XSPC Raystorm GTX 670 Waterblock**


I decided to buy this block for my MSI GTX670 OC (reference nVidia short board) because the alternatives like Aqua Computer, however, and may fit some GTX 670's with a long GTX 680 board) .  I picked this block up off [Performance PC's](http://www.performance-pcs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=34906) for $100 USD.  This is a little below average as most other full cover blocks will run around $120.  


*Performance*


My card was running pretty hot on the stock cooler at around 80C-90C while playing games like BF3.  After mounting this block


*Features*


The block comes with a bunch of thermal pads to cool the memory and another bank of small chips.  These pads are a little annoying to mount because they are not sticky and slide around while mounting the block.  Aside from that


The best part of the block is the 7 way port that allows you to place fittings in any direction you want.  They have two ports facing the top of the card, and one facing toward the power plugs.  The port facing the power plugs is useless, however, as the two PCI-E plugs block any chance of a fitting fitting in there.  XSPC includes 5 end plugs to block the rest of the ports.


**Pictures**


[link](http://imgur.com/a/3MwcH)


The block looks great with the lights and matches the GTX 670 block perfectly.  Unfortunately


The delerin block with the port holes on the GTX 670 is not actually scratched and dirty looking when it is delivered. My camera is just crappy.

After cleaning the machine and doing everything shown in the video on Newegg I put everything back together. After booting up (and not overclocking) I noticed that my temps were now between 47 and 51 degrees. I attempted to overclock to 3.71GHz and while running Prime95 my temps hit 85 degrees. I stopped before they could get any higher.

I've had this machine since 2010 and I've been building my own PC's since 2000. I've built around 12 or 13 for me and other people.

I'm going to go into the BIOS, while running this Prime95 thing, I'm under the impression that I am to use Real Temp to ensure that my PC temp doesn't reach over roughly 63 degrees Celsius. If the temps stay stable, i'm gonna try to lower the Vcore (to what?) and try again, making sure it stays stable. I'm under the impression that the lower the Vcore the better, is that correct?

Video Card:

To OC the GPU

* Uninstall your current display drivers.
* Reboot into safe mode
* Run Drive sweeper to remove all display drivers(including intel)
* Reboot
* Download the 12.4 Beta drivers (quick google search)
* Install only the display driver with no other addons. DO NOT install CCC.
* Reboot
* Download and install Asus GPU tweak 2.08
* Reboot
* Open up GPU tweak for the first time. On the bottom left there are three tiny buttons on the side. Click the middle Octogon to enable Advanced mode.
* Go to the settings tab
* Save
* Reboot
* Open up GPU tweak

After this

2.) Could I overclock my 5770s with stock cooling? If so

3.) What are normal temperatures idle and load for the CPU and GPU? I'm looking at around 35c idle and 60c under load for the CPU

4.) Would it be worth it to get an aftermarket cooler (for either CPU or GPU) and overclock them? Would I see a big performance boost? And how hard is it to install one of those things?

However I seem to be vastly underperforming in benchmarks. In Heaven 2.5 I am getting less than half of what I've seen others post. I knew my Q6600 would be a bottleneck but I didn't think it would be this significant. I also believe my RAM is only 800MHz.

I will upgrade the rest of my rig to suit my card more

To be honest it's only the benchmarks I'm struggling on, and higher than that and I get stuck at a ""Detecting array..."" boot message.

Basically is there anything I can do to improve performance before my upgrade in a few months time? Any overclocking attempts I've made have failed miserably

I started by bumping up the memory clock on both 7970s by 50 each time and running a loop of heaven. I saw artifacts at 1600 so I concluded 1550 was a good clock. I then set the memory back to 1450 and started bumping the core clock. I got the core clock to 1150 and ran the heaven loop 5 times then did 3dmark and played some bf3

So I tried to up the voltage because I checked and the vddc was at 1025, so I did that and restarted again. I was using Sapphire Trixx to change the vddc, and CCC to change the clocks. I saw that Trixx had set the voltage back to 1.025V which was frustrating (I had all of the ""start with windows"" on Trixx settings checked) so I switched to MSI Afterburner. I increased the voltage to 1.25V and tried 1200mhz again. It didn't work so I went back to 1150 and suddenly I couldn't even open heaven without it crashing instantly, when 1150 was running great before, even though I had just increased the voltage from 1.025 to 1.25! So I tried 1100, no go, 1075, this is all at 1.25V. Finally I just set everything back to stock

One thing to note is I watched gpu-z when running benchmarks and games and no matter what the voltage was set to the cards would only go up to ~1V and then crash after a bit

One more thing is I ran the bioshock benchmark before any overclocking, moving turbo on 3570k (I have questions on this later) to 4.4Ghz. I ended the benchmark with 100 avg fps, which is a solid -8% difference. Why would this be?

2) I have something called 'Intel Turbo Boost' that came with the mobo

1) How do I overclock with this board? Do I need to use OC Genie? How do I know I'm doing it safely? Can I get to 4.2 without changing the voltage?

 These voltages are during prime 95 stress test

 Is 1.336v stable okay under prime 95 load okay? Is it way to high? Why would my chip have such a problem using lower voltages.

I built my desktop one and a half years ago, but I want to do a bit better. My worry with OCing is that the motherboard only has 5-phase power  ( its an MSI mATX board), would that be safe to overclock with?

Also, how much higher should I go if I want to actually see improved performance?I was thinking 3.5 at the least, but any advice here would be helpful. One last thing, my motherboard has an ""easy OC switch"", its a set of DIP switches on the mobo that apparently quickly changes the clock multiplier. Is this the better way to go

I have been increasing my offset voltage step by step

Now, from my first overclocking step to this 4.5GHz one. I'm keeping my 7850 at core clock right now (though I have pushed it wonderfully to about 1170/5800 @ 1.16V).  I've also found that it may refer to low North Bridge voltage.  Should I try to bump that up?  I haven't heard much of voltage increases in the NB itself.
  
I haven't heard of anyone else getting this particular BSOD while overclocking

Thanks!  

Some BIOS settings:  
All clocks  
Multiplier: 45    
Base Clock: 100MHz (default)  
Voltage: offset - 0.060V   
LLC - Level 3   
DRAM - set to specified voltage (1.5)

&gt;EDIT: An even weirder problem just happened too.  I decided to check my RAM since the BSOD is referencing north bridge.  I made a bootable USB stick for memtest and booted into it.  I'm told that Memtest should automatically start checking my RAM, but it's not doing anything.  Below my CPU it reads Settings: RAM as  
&gt;0MHz (DDR3 - 0)  
&gt;And in the center of the screen reads  
&gt;2828K e820 off  

&gt;Not sure what that's about.  

##Solved that edit: I was using an outdated version of memtest.  4.20 supports sandy bridge.  My RAM tested without errors.

###Update:  
I followed the settings [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/tckre/need_some_help_ocing_2500k_and_7850/c4lio5e), up to 1.45V where I refuse to go higher.",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,True,,

the memory is rated at 1600mhz, 1.5v, and that's how the memory settings default. it also defaults to CAS 9. at first, all I did to change this was enable XMP. 1600 was set automatically, though the voltage remained at motherboard default rather than memory default and CAS remained at 9. it seemed to work fine for a couple of weeks, and then on every other boot (precisely every second cold boot, oddly) I would get a momentary bluescreen flash right before the windows logo and a reboot

I turned off XMP and set the speed to 1600 by setting the multiplier to 16. I turned off Turbo boost for memory (didn't even see that option there the first time). I also set the voltage up to 1.65, I thought I shouldn't make too many changes at once or I'd confuse myself. The problem seems to have gone away, but it took two weeks to appear in the first place so I'm not sure.

* Flip the *switch* from position 1 to 2 WHILE OFF (its next to the Crossfire bridge contacts) This automatically switches to a second bios with OC settings like 880Mhz gpu and +0.055 vdc boost
* Any setting applied in the Catalyst Overdrive^TM settings is per GPU meaning you have to click the drop down menu and apply the settings to the second display adapter.
* In the Catalyst Overdrive^TM settings push the Power control settings to +20% this allow the card to give the GPUs extra wattage and raise the thermal limit 

I run a waterblock on my GPU so most of the thermal issues are nonexistent as it idles at ~110F and ~140F loaded. Also flipping the switch will increas the power draw from 375w to 450w so you better have a big +12VDC rail

1) set to 'sync on all cores'

The tests I ran were an hour of AIDA64 stability test followed by 5 runs of 3DMARK11 (which I am beginning to notice is wrong).


Anyway, the temps never went above 80c. So I decided that it seemed stable enough and proceeded to set the voltage control to adaptive (with a maximum of 1.23v) and go on my way.


Everything was fine, I was surfing the internet when I got hit with a BSOD, leaving me to believe that my 'stable' overclock isn't so stable afterall.


Is there something I can do to stabilise my OC? I don't mind sitting at 4ghz


I understand that my stability tests can be a little more thorough


Is there a comprehensive guide for overclocking haswell? The video seemed to fudge over a lot of details and just seemed to be for a quick and dirty OC with a really lucky CPU. The one I have I understand is crap but I wanna get the most out of it.


Also, which is why I chose adaptive. However I get the impression that people are torn between the option. Some are for it, some are against. I would like to hear the opinions of both sides so I have a better understanding.

First submission here and I am hoping to get some help in regards to overclocking my CPU and the benefit it may or may not have on my system.

My computer is primarily a gaming machine and the specs are as follows:

2x GTX780 in sli
i7 980x
6GB DDR3 RAM
ASUS P6TD Deluxe Motherboard
Antec 850W PSU

The 780's are new as of this week and the rest of the system is a couple of years older. When I purchased the 980x I was told it was one of the best CPU's on the market at the time and I also invested in a Noctua (DH-12?) cooler for it.

Now that I have two high end graphics cards I was wondering about overclocking the CPU and if it might be bottlenecking the cards as it is slightly older. Currently CPU-Z tells me it is running at 3.33ghz.

Is it worth overclocking my CPU purely from a gaming standpoint and what benefit would it even have?

I watched a video today on overclocking where the person in question started ended up having his CPU running at a lower voltage but faster clock speeds. Does this mean I could just go into my BIOS and leave my voltage as is but just choose to have the processor run at 4.0ghz? 

Sorry if these questions are the equivalent of adding two and two together for a small child but I'm a complete newbie when it comes to this stuff and I just want to find out if there is a benefit to overclocking CPU from a gaming perspective and how to go about it.

Turns out, my cpu is fried, what do I do? Well, I called a good family friend that is in the computer industry, he is a software developer working for himself, and he put me in contact with a good friend of his that sells computer hardware. So he gave me his number and told me to call saying that he sent me.

So I did. David answered and I told him what happened, that's business was located roughly 30 minutes from my house. He told me that he was willing to sell me an Intel i7-3770k 3.5ghz cpu for $250. Look it up online, lowest i could find was $320.

So I said yeah ill buy it

Turns out, but basically he builds super high end servers and overclocks them to 4.9ghz. Well, not all cpus can run that fast, he said they have a 50% fail rate for their test. So basically he has all these working cpus that just didnt meet the requirements that he needs, and just resells them to try and make back what he lost from buying them. 

So i arrived, and then overclocked it to 4.3ghz for me =). Now some of you might say push it farther, but I don't want to mess with any of the settings. Its higher than the 3.9ghz turbo or w.e its pushed up too, and it runs great.

So, but i have a great running machine, and im happy

After not procuring the EVGA forums for awhile, **which I would not recommend overvolting to on air/stock cooler.**

Picture of the program: [http://puu.sh/3FgT3.png](http://puu.sh/3FgT3.png)

It's virus free and all that jazz. Here's an explanation of the slider bars:

Explanation: [http://puu.sh/3Fh57.png](http://puu.sh/3Fh57.png)

It's important to note that 1.3v, but others that may not want to run this can lower it to 1.275v or lower and be relatively safer.

**NOTE: Your voltage will not change to the voltage you set it to in EVGA Precision X

Example: [http://puu.sh/3FhCr.jpg](http://puu.sh/3FhCr.jpg)

The default voltage of the memory is set @ 1.6v, I've set this to a max of 1.8v.

**NOTE: When changing the FBVDD, and the FBVDD did apply.**

I have did not edit my PEXVDD voltages, causing the Nvidia Driver to crash multiple times. So, I've opted to reset them and leave them at their default values.


**Testing:**

I used Unigine's Valley benchmark for testing purposes. The reason behind this is because, as I've always been able to hit higher OC's in 3D Mark, yet that same OC being unstable in real world games/applications.

If you're unfamiliar with stability testing

Next, then you're stable, and may choose to further increase this clock and test again. If it crashes at any point, you need to lower your GPU offset. This will take some time.

**Watch your temperatures!**

@NVVDD 1.3v: For me

Once you have your GPU clock stable, testing for stability.

@FBVDD 1.8v: For me


So

GPU @ 1355Mhz clock
Memory @ 3750Mhz clock

Also:

CPU @ 5.0Ghz @ 1.422v on H2O.


**Results:**

Valley ended up scoring a very respectable 4036.

Max Temperature: [http://puu.sh/3Fiow.png](http://puu.sh/3Fiow.png)

You can see the clocks in the top right when zooming in. You may need to play with your stability a bit before actually settling on something your happy with. It can take a month or so before you find an OC your happy with. Just don't rush it and take your time in stability testing.

It's making overclocking any further impossible (though the IGP in this thing can overclock like crazy, I've been over 1100 MHz up from 833 with no difficulties), as no matter what I do or how much thermal headroom I have, the CPU just automatically downclocks over 1.362v.

I built a mini PC a while back and I was curious to see if I could overclock it a bit.

I really like the TRESSFX looks with the hair, but any scene where it zooms close on Lara the FPS drops down to about 12. I was hoping overclocking the PC could help get these up close scenes up to 35 and average gameplay to at minimum 50 FPS.

My main issue is that I only have a stock cooler on the CPU

After a little reading on the forums and on reddit

&gt; There are 2 ways to overclock the 2500k. The generally accepted best way to do it is by increasing the multiplier of the Turbo. You can lock it so that under load all 4 cores will be overclocked to the same setting. A common overclock is 45x turbo, and 1.6GHz at idle. The other way to overclock would be to completely disable Turbo. This also generally means you will be disabling Cool n Quiet (or whatever microsoft calls it.) The reason this way is not generally recommended is because your computer would never clock down at idle. You'd always be running at 4.5GHz. This also means the the voltage must also remain high at all times to prevent random crashes. Avoid this method.

GPUTweak, - when I go out of the game it jumps right up to 1400 and almost fries the card. These are by the way the voltages the monitor in GPU tweak displays. 

The vdroop is usually about 40 - 50 mV variation between most and least voltage usage in games. 

The temps are pretty good when testing since I have 100% fanspeed. About 55 degrees Celsius

The LLC is set to 100 and the power target is set to 20

The card by the way never idles and safe mode doesn't work. It's always on blue or higher color

I also had a pretty usual issue where the Mobo didn't recognize my card at first. Had to trial and error for two days before I somehow got it working.

Does anyone know how to fix these issues or what to do to test what part there's something wrong with? Are there any other voltage indicators I should use? I'm really not sure if I can trust GPUTweak or not.

1357411126.0,160mnr,Have some questions about overclocking my cpu,tornados2111,7,1,9,"I was going to upgrade my dual core pentium e5400 2.7Ghz but today read that it was quite good for overclocking. I tried overclocking it and was surprised by the performance boost in a lot of games that are actually limited by my processor (I know this because I use msi afterburner and see my gpu levels are low). So far I have overclocked my processor to 3.3Ghz with 1.45 voltage (Haven't tried minimising the voltage yet). I heard that it will go up to around 4.3Ghz on air but I am somewhat hesitant to go any further. I'm worried about the temperatures. I have the stock cooler and at idle I'm getting 40 degrees and at load (around 100% load) in crysis 2 got a maximum of 83 degrees. Do you guys think it is safe to overclock slightly more? Or is it too dangerous? Also,self,
1357252931.0,15wx1r,Need a little help with my BIOS/Overclock settings i3770k and Biostar TZ77XE3,jazzyjack45,5,2,0,"My temps are fine and the voltage is nice and low but the problem I have is that I cannot get the Intel Speedstep to kick in when I'm idling. Within my BIOS when I choose to have a fixed CPU ratio that is when I am able to change the multiplier. At the same time the option to change my Intel Speedstep becomes greyed out but still says enabled.

Is anyone familiar with this problem and have a setting I can change? I am currently using a -.100 offset voltage if that matters.

Here is a pic of my temps and such ambient temp is 19 Celsius for those wondering why my temps may seem low.

I've just purchased my first PC after having been out of the PC game for a few years (5)

I'm getting back to my roots in a big way and although I've never overclocked before

I got a 3930k(3.2)

I've been watching some youtube videos but to be honest I'm still kind of confused. My goal is to start with a conservative(?) overclock of 4.2 and see where it goes.

As far as I can tell

Now

I'm looking for a guide

1356916245.0,15p6i9,Suggestion: Open loop liquid cooling and G12 automobile coolant,fpsrandy,7,3,5,"I just wanted to suggest to everyone based off my experience with liquid cooling that I am super impressed/happy with using G12 coolant in my computer.

This coolant is used in my VW Golf; it costs $30 CAD for a 4 Litre jug of concentrated coolant. I mixed it 50/50 with distilled water

It is sold to the PC liquid community as ""Water Wetter""

This stuff has a pinkish color to it

The big pluses of this stuff (besides price vs volume and being able to get it locally) is that you shouldn't need to change the coolant that often. I was lazy over the past year and finally got off my ass to change the coolant after over a year of use (my temps never rose so I only ever topped it up a bit). The coolant I drained from my system looks just as clean as the new stuff. I took apart my blocks to clean them and there was only minor traces of gunk/buildup

This is much better than the green swiftech stuff I use to use. That stuff would go from green to a deep black color

Now I would go on a limb and say that this stuff mixed at 50/50 I would never need to be changed until you needed to change your loop. I would totally reuse the stuff I drained out of my system again if it wasn't for the fact that I still have 2 litres of mixed coolant (4L of concentrate mixed 50/50 to make 8L of mixed coolant; ~5 litres went into my car

Just like antifreeze for your car

And yes, change your tubing, or needing to scrub your blocks as often.

I have not mixed this with dyes; dyes tend to cause bad gunk build up and I couldn;t find any reliable sources that said I could mix G12 with dyes.",self,t5_2rfc8,False,,amd,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/15p6i9/suggestion_open_loop_liquid_cooling_and_g12/

My brain seems not to be able to understand the difference between them and how they work. This is what I got so far:

Manual is a set voltage on what you choose. 

Offset is fluctuating on demand, what value is this added to?
