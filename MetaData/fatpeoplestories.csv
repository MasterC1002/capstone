1364133009.0,1awv99,Excuse making hambeast in class shut down,Tim8080,3962,472,175,"   In my college English class yesterday we were discussing our final research paper topics. When it was my turn I told my professor and the class that my topic was going to be the obesity epidemic in America. I outline my topic and what points I was going to focus on. All seemed to be going well
     I was wrong, one of which was to the spine, im in a wheelchair. I lift and exercise all the time and am ripped. I was wearing a tight shirt to show that off that day too.
      I just look at her coldly and say in a flat tone, I can't imagine how hard it is. Then I grab my legs, wiggle them like wet spaghetti at her. Many in the class laughed or giggled. She turned bright red, sputtered, started to cry and had to leave class. It's one of the few great things about being in a wheelchair, hambeast excuses have no effect on me.",,self,,

OK, blah, blah:


Been losing lots of weight. Losing Hamplanet status and becoming Mini-Moon, as people get defensive or uncomfortable around me. Mostly, they start justifying their food choices. Sometimes, when it is really bad, people get downright bitchy and start acting as thought I am doing something wrong. 


This is the first time an all out fight has occurred. And I blame you

On Saturday I went for a rare night out with the hubby to a friend's house for drinks. It is always a big occasion when this happens


Everything is going well, not even then), and always has an opinion that is full of nothing but stupid. She is also a massive bitch. 


The others are generally not that nice to her, because I think their treatment of her is kind of messed up. I am a bit of a softy, when it comes down to it. 


About halfway through the night


This displeases the elephant-princess


""I can't believe you gave into that shit


Now, and I am a little slow on the uptake. 


**I didn't see things coming


""That dieting bullshit. That we have to be skinny to be happy. It is nothing but a scam by the magazine industry


""I don't think there is a correlation between obesity and magazines


Clearly


""Bullshit

At this point everyone is staring at us, and he is glaring openly.


""EP


""You want to look hot, but she is going to cheat on you.""


**WHAT?!**


At this point even her own boyfriend (who never says shit) tells her to shut up. But she is just getting started. 


""No! That is what happens? These women lose all this weight for no reason


Losing control....


""And you aren't even healthy. I am definitely more healthy than you


What happens next, the invalidation of the work I had done, the questioning of my methods and motives, the fact that so many people feel the right to comment on my life choices. I had just had it. 


So I did what I never should have done. 


I let this subreddit merge with real life. 


I entered the FPS Zone.


**""SHUT THE FUCK UP


Yes


""I refuse to be lectured on health *or* feminism by Hamzilla


OMG, you guys. 


Dead silence around us. 


HFW I can't even find a gif that describes it. 


Already, calls me a cunt and leaves. 


Her boyfriend gets up and goes after her. I can actually hear them shouting at the side of the house. We are in the backyard. Then we hear it: 


""THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO FUCK THE WHORE


All of us stop and look at each other. What? 


Evidently, she screamed that, and...


...they broke up. 


My FPS caused a breakup

I don't know how I feel about my interactions with people, hence my epic freak out above. 


Has anyone else ever faced constant criticism when they started losing a lot of weight? Don't get me wrong


Edit: Format.

Edit #2: Jesus Christ...I cannot believe how much attention this has gotten. It was at, and I feel so much better about what happened.

1363899563.0,1ar8op,She wanted to ride a horse. ,SometimesIArt,2910,345,237,"Backstory: 

I've always worked in the horse industry, and stayed there into my late teens leading trails/driving wagons. And because of how long I'd been there I ended up being the barn manager/running the farm because the owners were lazy and wanted nothing to do with the animals. 

This story took place on said farm. 

One morning we get a call in for a party of 5 to go out on a 2hr trail. That requires 7 horses because two guides

They show up a bit early, so I send the workers off to bring out the horses/get the riders up while I finish up saddling the last of them. 

After they go out, you're gonna want to come and... meet... the riders..."" 

""Why

""Er... yeah... um... just come. Please?"" 

I go out into the ""start"" area and am greeted by 4 overweight-but-not-obese people and 1 woman whose legs I'm not entirely sure existed. She had to be like 450lbs. I panic, either. 

I walk up, and the bubblebutt woman enthusiastically confirms that they're super excited. I just smile tensely and say ""awesome, well... you're a bit earlier than expected, just give us a few minutes to finish up."" And everyone's super cool. 

I go back to the fields and grab one of the wagon horses. 

[One of these motherfuckers.](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/002/f/7/Percheron_Stallion_Stock_by_AdeliePenguin.jpg)

Manage to find a saddle that will fit him

Start matching horses and riders

""No, I owned her, she was my competition horse I guided trails with to keep her fit. 

""Ahw

""Ma'am

She pauses. She knows full well why that one is hers, he's too big. I'm afraid of him."" 

""He's super gentle

""You can't get on a horse that big. Can you even ride something like that? I don't believe you. Why do I have to have the big one?!"" 

Do you really want me to answer that?!

She goes on whining for a while while the others are mounted up. Finally

She can't get up like a normal person. Duhdur. 

She refuses to try to get on using the fence. (""I'll fall over the fence! It's too dangerous!"") 

Finally

She gets up annnnnd.... begins to slide off of the other side. The horse gives me a ""wtf are you doing to me?"" look as I rush around and desperately shove her from the other side

Crisis averted

Close enough. 

She's mad at me still. Horse is mad at me. 

[hfw](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OPhyCc8vYGA/T8_CbBHz2tI/AAAAAAAABpk/IKcERum2rHo/s1600/sad_horse.jpg)

Worker comes back, I'm going to fall off, everyone is going to die, her life is in danger, she's going to fall and break her neck... and the kicker: 

""Just because I'm big doesn't mean you need to make fun of me and make me ride this huge mountain!!!"" 

LIVNG. BREATHING. ANIMAL. YOU. FUCK. 

I'm standing there waiting for her to finish and hoping she cancels and storms off. Her family looks embarrassed. The horse looks miserable. The workers don't know what to do. The other guide is waiting for us to go. 

I ask if she still wants to go on the ride. 

""YES. I DO. HORSES ARE MY FAVOURITE. HORSES ARE MY LIFE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR THE THING YOU LOVE.""

Food? Must say nothing. 

I get up (from the ground

We go out. 

She starts to have fun. 

""I WANNA GALLOP!"" 

""No

""NO FAIR WAAAAAAH."" 

Half an hour in. ""I'm hungry

""Hour and a half."" 

""Did you bring snacks?""

""... no.""

""Fine

Doubt it. 

Hour in. 

""I'm TIIIIIIRED. I'm SOOOOORE. I'm HUUUUUNGRY. This horse is LAAAAAAAZY. I want to GALLOOOOOOOP."" 

NO WE ARE NOT FUCKING GALLOPING STFU FFS. 

 I've had to yell at her multiple times to stop yanking on the horse's face

You sat your fat ass on his poor back

We end up taking a shorter way in because she started crying because she was so hungry and angry we wouldn't let her gallop. We get back and it takes both workers and all four of her family members to get her down. 

Ever hear a sigh of relief from a HORSE? Yeah. 

I fed that horse a zillion treats and spent half the night giving him acupressure treatment that day. What a trooper. 

After that we changed our policy to have a serious weight restriction of 300lbs. Farm owners were not happy about it

I was a rock climbing instructor. I helped people survive their way up a 50 foot wall. Twas a normal day, whale-man had his eyes locked on the wall. A wave of fear rushes over me. 

I see him waddle over to the front desk and point at my wall. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. I'm the one who has to belay the monster. That means if (and when...) the whale decides to come off the wall and beach himself

I tell the whale I need to know his weight for safety and planning reasons (type of rope, will I make it out alive questions, etc.). He clocks in at mere 521 pounds. WHY ARE YOU HERE? I put him on the beginners wall. He can't use a stretchy rope. He has to use a shitty non-stretch rope to give him a 10% chance of survival. If he falls, he may break the rope. Fuck me. This means I can't strap to the ground using [these types of straps](http://imgur.com/ghDYeyZ). This means if he falls I'm going to go up when he comes down. This means... shit. This is just bad news. 

The whale takes off. Makes it up three feet, he goes to the ground. He's had enough. Thank god it's over. Whale: ""see you tomorrow"". Whatttttttt? 

Tomorrow he's back. Then the next day, he would come all the way down. Turns out it's a pretty good time. 

After one year, overhangs and inverted sections. 

The whale's name was Greg and he never once complained about how he was too fat to rock climb. He never got pissed at the university for investing over $100k in a rock wall meant for ""skinny people"" (Like me? Ha. Right.). He never said ""I can't"". He just shut up and did it. I liked Greg

Oh, we left with Hammy and the Bloatedfish embarrassing herself at an important dinner with the bosses looking on. Me and Jan (also know as Fatty Bait, or /u/notbelgianbutdutch) are nice(ish) people with a high tolerance for stupidity in the name of hilarity. To those of you who asked/ expressed concern, I am much better, thank you :). The stomach bug came and went, and I am no longer ""bulimic"". but don't tell that to our friend Hamthrax, or she might freak out and crush a mid-sized Japanese City. 

Cut to early March. Bf has completed his part of the project and is generally  happier person. After the dinner fiasco, they've been trying to get rid of her since the Christmas party, but Hamthrax apparently got herself a lawyer and threatened to wage a messy, greasy discrimination suit against them. Raise your hand if this shocks you. 

But now, mayo-less day in the Big Apple. Quick someone tell her it's called that and she'll leave this city forever. Now, Jan, as much as I love him, can be literally the most forgetful person in the entire world. This day he left his lunch, his phone, and his keys in the apartment. I had only morning classes that day

Because. 

I put [this list](http://i.imgur.com/6YGLOE2.jpg) up on my fridge because everyone has officially announced they want to be healthier in my household (even British Roommate!). I took note of the most common things everyone in the house eats

And everything. 

Everything. 

That Eventual Planet eats is super high cal. 

Granola, butter, cheese, hollandaise sauce, homo milk, fries, ice cream, cookies, burgers, sugary Starbucks… 

Everything.

She thought I was making numbers up to prove her wrong. Bitch broke my computer a few days ago and has been itching to go off on me since I made her pay for it.

She got SO mad at me when she saw the list

Anyways.

Right now

She just realized she chucks back over 3500cal/day. Oh my gosh. I feel like a horrible person for laughing so hard. But she won't stop yelling at Google. 

""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN 500 CALORIES?!"" 

""GRANOLA'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUCKING HEALTHY!"" 

""DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK THERE'S NO WAY I CAN ONLY HAVE THAT MUCH SUGAR A DAY! BULLSHIT!"" 

""BUT IT'S *VEGGIE* PIZZA!"" 

She is so mad at real life right now guys. 

And she's shouting all of it through mouthfuls of grilled cheese with bacon in it.

Oh shit. My sides. I can't breathe. Oh my gosh. This feels so good. 

*Maybe she'll freaking make it now.* If this doesn't give her a heart attack in the next hour.

For those of you who are just *tooooo* disabled to read my previous installments, before leaving work for the day, Lard Lover had sent out emails to both myself, my Dept. Head and the Head of HR threatening to have us fired, and to sue us for discrimination against her 'disability', time lost and expenses occurred due to ~~I don't fucking know~~ loss of lunch time, I'm guessing.

&gt;Well

&gt;I stare in

&gt;""Got lawyer from Lard Lover. Come 'ASAP'""

&gt;Lard Lover paying hourly premium for that bloke

&gt;Decide to go around and help some interns with basic tickets

As I walk in

&gt;""Sorry for interrupting your important work [me]

&gt;""HOW DARE YOU. That BITCH has caused me considerable emotional and financial damage! I demand that you at least demote her to the position she really deserves""

&gt;""So suddenly YOU think that you have the right to dictate to me

&gt;Giggle continuously as I help through 2 more tickets

&gt;What's this?

&gt;""YOU WON'T BE GETTING US TO LEAVE HERE WITHOUT AN APOLOGY AND A COURT DATE""

&gt;I don't think she understands how this works

&gt;Wait... she said a 'real' lawyer?

&gt;Security finally arrives

I go and sit to calm my nerves in HR Dept. Head's office, we talk.

&gt;""Well, and demanding your resignation. I'm guessing she couldn't get a real lawyer to take up her case, so she tried to scare us into giving her a settlement""

&gt;""HA. So there won't be anymore from her?""

She doesn't speak verbally but she's incredibly intelligent and uses a machine to speak for her. Her wheelchair is petty large and to get in and out of my van we use a lift system. This morning we headed out to Walmart to do some early back to school shopping. She is SO excited and hellllll yeah

As we're leaving however my girl starts having seizures. Oh shit. We dash to the van to get her emergency meds and don't you fucking know it some cunt is parked in the area for the lift. Are you fucking kidding me. The medicine to stop the seizure is in the form of a gel that goes in rectally, and head to find a manager. They announce over the speaker system that the person blocking our van needs to move IMMEDIATELY. 

We go back outside and wait. And wait. 5 min goes by

Attempting to hold my rage back

The one I assume is female starts to turn an even deeper shade of red and roars ""THIS SPACE IS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITAHS. IM HANDICAPPED AND I NEED THIS SPACE HOW DARE YOU TRY TO RUSH ME WE DON'T MOVE AS FAST AS PEOPLE LIKE *YOU*"". 

I apologize and say their placard isn't up and being disabled they should understand the frustration of not being able to have the accommodations they need and would they please move their goddamn car so we can leave. 

This sends the wild beetusbeast into a frenzy ranting and literally spitting about how they know ALL about not getting the accommodations they need because they were denied a placard and how fat discrimination at the hands of thin people is LITERALLY the worst thing anyone could ever face. As I'm trying to keep my cool and politely repeat to this fucking grease ball that she needs to move (I'm working.. Don't yell.. I'm working... Don't smack her...) I notice my friend going to town on her communication device. 

""I am disabled. You are fat. Move your fucking car."" 

The look on this woman's face was the most priceless and beautiful thing I've ever seen and I love the girl I work with so much. 

After a few minutes of stuttering and ""FAT IS A DISABILITY"" grunts the guy she was with finishes loading the car and they were off. 

My girl is still smirking about it. 

Edit: Since people keep asking - letting her chill and backing the van out wasn't an option. The wheelchair is a pain in the ass and the brakes don't work. The parking area has a slope to it. I couldn't find a spot that was both within my line of sight and not against a car or something to have her wait. She and I would both rather wait than be out of sight from each other or at risk of rolling into traffic in a situation like this. Please stop messaging me about what a terrible aide I am.

*edit* It is ridiculously difficult to evacuate a clinic full of actual sick and very old people who are in the process of testing.  This makes it an even bigger douche move.

&gt;He looks me straight in the eye unapologetically and opens his 2 liter and guzzles the entire thing and reaches for another cupcake.

&gt;They're small and don't need to eat like I do! I have the BEETUS and my sugars is low!

&gt;Still stunned from the barrage of shit piled on me by this one HR manager

&gt;Got the Dept. Heads on my side at least

&gt;Yeah that should count for something

I sat in my office

&gt;Getting close to the end of the day

&gt;About 45min after the PTSD causing events of the last post occured

&gt;3pm chai tea

&gt;See bathroom

&gt;Waves of fear and disgust overcome me

&gt;Look into the stalls again

&gt;Dear god the evidence is still there!

&gt;Still there...

&gt;....HA

&gt;Call my Dept. Manager

&gt;""Goddamn it

&gt;I nod solemnly

&gt;Both Dept. Heads burst out into laughter. The smear of makeup had the clear

&gt;I wish I could laugh

&gt;1000yardstare.iso

After seeing the destruction and the two clearly used condoms, and go with the HR Dept. Head to give my 'testimony'. I felt like I was a witness to a crime against humanity

&gt;Oh lift music

&gt;Walk around HR's floor

&gt;Walk past Mr DesperateRomantics office

&gt;See Lard Lover

&gt;Had a take away container

&gt;2ltr bottle of diet coke

&gt;Mr DesperateRomantic see's us walking by

&gt;Never seen a deer in the headlights

&gt;Scoot off to the Dept. Head's office

&gt;Corner office view

&gt;Please

I tell all to the Dept. Head, I recounted the accusations leveled at me regarding Lard Lover claiming I made a false accusation against her sexually harassing ShyIntern. This did not settle well. 

&gt;""Why on earth was I not told beforehand?! Any false accusation claims come directly to me""

&gt;""Maybe you should ask Mr DesperateRomantic""

&gt;Please let Lard Lover still be there

&gt;Please, Please...

&gt;YES

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic

&gt;""N-No. She is here t-to finish her lunch""

&gt;""She has been on lunch since about 12 when I saw her leaving for McDonalds. Lard Lover

&gt;Lard Lover takes another

&gt;*HHURRRRGGGLLLLLL*

&gt;""WELLL

&gt;""Well, you've claimed that you've been disabled. Tell me, how did you manage to get past HR's protocol?""

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic said that he had everything sorted out for me!""

&gt;""Well

&gt;""THIS IS DISCRIMINATION. ITS CLEAR THAT I HAVE A CONDITION. Mr DesperateRomantic said he would deal with this!""

All three of us look towards Mr DesperateRomantic, this cow had managed to swindle benefits from the company for a non existent disability. The HR Dept Head layed into him.

&gt;""I-I've delt with t-the disability of Lard Lover f-for a while n-now... s-she had proof b-but lost it""

&gt;""So you saw the proof

&gt;""IT'S BECAUSSE MY CONDITION IS REEEEAL""

&gt;""And what IS your condition

And there was silence. 30 seconds of the most delightful, that I would be able to eat tuna casserole and chai tea again.

&gt;""Well, so it can't be that. Does that help narrow it down for you?""

&gt;HR Dept. Head has gone full alpha

&gt;Need to wipe my nose to hide my shit eating grin

&gt;""YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW

&gt;""But you've managed to claim several thousand dollars worth of benefits and equipment, or even Mr DesperateRomantic what your disability is, with a doctors certificate as proof, within the next 7 days, you will be subject to a RIGOROUS internal review. I hear from your Dept. Head that you've been doing very poorly indeed, and that Mr DesperateRomantic is the only reason you're still here""

&gt;""EXPECT TO HEAR FROM MY LAWYER IN THE MORNING

She left the room. Well, cracked the armrest (as she did with the other one she sat on), threw her take away container at the HR Dept. Head, and slammed the door behind her.

&gt;""Mr DesperateRomantic

&gt;Leave feeling triumphant as fuck

&gt;Make new chai

&gt;Get back to desk

&gt;Text SO to meet me at the pub later

&gt;All is good

&gt;*bzzz*

&gt;Huh

LOLNOPE

&gt;""I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOUR TIME AT THIS COMPANY HAS ENDED. [HR Dept. Head] CAN'T PROTECT YOU NOW, AND EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED WILL PAY. YOU'VE INVADED MY PRIVACY, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST MY DISABILITY, AND FORCED ME TO HAVE UNNEEDED EXPENSES. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU IN COURT.""

&gt;Put down the chai. Get out the flask

&gt;Wonder if she realizes this is a COMPANY email

&gt;Sigh

&gt;""So

&gt;Show him the email

&gt;""Well

And there, and many more will be settled. And hey, today I really don't have anything to do, so I *might* post the next saga sooner. Or I could starve you all, like the thin privileged whore I am! Haha!

Hi again, but haven't had the time to write.) I will say that at least this time, I have a good excuse for neglecting to feed you sweet, sweet hams.

You see, and, well, I didn't fare so well. I live very near to the Elbow River, which is one of two main rivers that runs through the city. I also happen to live in a basement room in the house I ~~am living in~~ lived at. 

Fortunately, and a few of my more valuable and irreplaceable possessions to higher ground. However, most everything else I own was lost to the water.

I spent a few nights at a shelter before heading to a friend's house on higher ground. I've been here looking for a new place to live ever since. 

Since my job has been shut down, helping other Calgarians to haul out the ruined possessions in their basements. It's been difficult, but I have seen some truly incredible things, both from individuals and corporations, both good and bad.

This is one of the latter.

Going green.

&gt;Finish the house we are on

&gt;We all go down to OJ's for our first hot meal in days

&gt;Get there, tired volunteers in line ahead of us

&gt;Hang around to eat and chat with other volunteers

&gt;Maybe a little bit to watch the free dinner show

&gt;FRF gets close to front of the line

&gt;All of a sudden

&gt;12 firefighters

&gt;Head up to the side of the table

&gt;He nods, and handing them to the firefighters

&gt;Firefighters take their delicious bounty and begin heading back to the truck

&gt;They be busy muthafuckers right now

&gt;This dipleases FRF

&gt;She loudly HARRUMPHs

&gt;A few volunteers shake their heads in disgust

&gt;Her time will come

&gt;Eventually

&gt;OJ's grill guy looks at her like she has two heads

&gt;OJGG: ""Uhhh... What the fuck are you doing?""

&gt;FRF: ""AHM HuNGRY AND I HERD YOU HAD FREE FOOD FOR HUNGRY PEOPLE""

&gt;OJGG: ""We are providing free hot meals to volunteers helping out with the flood effort. You don't seem to fit the bill.""

&gt;FRF: ""NAW WELL IM HUNGRY AND YOU HAFF TO FEED ME. IM NOT MOVING TIL YOU DO""

&gt;She plants herself in place

&gt;OJGG shrugs

&gt;This also displeases the Ham

&gt;The next time OJGG passes a burger around her

&gt;Fuck this shit. I've had it

&gt;I'm too tired

&gt;There is no beta today

&gt;I walk up to her

&gt;In hindsight

&gt;Me: ""You need to get out of line and apologize to everybody here right now

&gt;FRF: ""AHD LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY YOU FAT FUCK. WHY YOU EVFEN EATING THESE FRIES YOU'RE ALREADY TOO FAT""

For reference

&gt;And with that

&gt;Must have been the hamdrenaline from being in the presence of food

&gt;Grabs a handful of my fries

&gt;Still shaking

&gt;Continue to shake

&gt;Continue to scold

&gt;NO. BAD. DROP THEM

&gt;Fries still coming loose

&gt;Fatty still holding on to the fries

&gt;There is no anger anymore

&gt;Finally

&gt;Pull her by that hand out of line

&gt;Open the door for her

&gt;Me: ""Now you will get the FUCK in your car

&gt;FRF is about to cry

&gt;I don't care

&gt;Me: ""And save the waterworks. You think you are going to get any sympathy from these hardworking people that you just tried to steal food from? You're fucked. Now. Leave.""

&gt;FRF bursts into tears

&gt;She drives away

&gt;doing that engineering shit that everyone on Reddit is doing in between r/atheism posts.

&gt;Meet a lot of cool likeminded people in the process. 

&gt;Except for Hamfucker.

&gt;He's exactly what the name implies

&gt;He's 5'11"" and must weight god damned near 400-450 lbs.

&gt;Now

&gt;I know those rationalizations we've all come to know as fatlogic.

&gt;Started lifting like a motherfucker sophomore year of high school. Got ripped to bits by freshman year of college. 190 lbs at 10% bf. I made it brahs.

&gt;SonOfZeuspose.jpg

&gt;At this point in the story I was a hefty 225 lbs again

&gt;I've competed in and won meets.

&gt;Back to the Fucker of Ham.

&gt;He was in the engineering program with me.

&gt;Loud

&gt;Smelled like mildew and sour milk.

&gt;Wears the same Nyan-Cat shirt almost everday.

&gt;Also

&gt;Ate a family sized bag of chips everyday in statics

&gt;He also has an ego-complex.

&gt;Thinks he's god'- I mean Sagan's gift to science.

&gt;Constantly belittles people by gloating his grades above theirs even if he was well within the c-range for most of the class.

&gt;Professor would sometimes leave the gradebook open on the computer when he went to the BR or to grab something from his office.

&gt;Hamfucker took it upon himself to go through and announce the failing grade of a classmate.

&gt;Classmate was having a rough semester, and in between working and helping his parents his grades slipped. He was still keepin on though.

&gt;Cue deathglare from everyone.

&gt;""Lol what? I was just saying the truth.""

&gt;Classmate sits their looking pretty defeated. Guy ended up dropping the class the next day.

&gt;""Huehuehue"" to himself and walks away back to his Ruffles chips.

&gt;Professor comes back in and I pull him aside after class to explain what happened. 

&gt;Prof is a bro

&gt;Walking out of class hear whining and foot stamping coming from the prof's direction.

&gt;Hamfucker isn't having it.

&gt;Fast forward to later in the semester.

&gt;Hamfucker has interjected himself into our social group.

&gt;Whatever, the guy is entertaining, the childishness and the utter bullshit he spews from his gullet is impossible to believe. 

&gt;Fellow engineering-bro starts asking me about lifting.

&gt;I've had some confidence issues because of my former Spherical-Mode

&gt;peoplebemirin.jpg

&gt;""Lifting all that weight is bad for your joints"" interjects Hamfucker.

&gt;""And I suppose you're an expert on that subject as well?"" I ask.

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;Always lies about shit

&gt;""Well

&gt;ohshit.fuckdidisaythat

&gt;Beady eyes narrow, expelling heavy fumes of cheeto-dust. Can see him struggling to find an explanation.

&gt;Him: ""And that's why you're chubbier than I am.""

&gt;Finally, save for the fat undulation, piece of shit.

&gt;everyone just bursts out laughing

I put my phone down and finished getting ready for work. Now armed with the knowledge that she isn't trying to get me to just fix her home computer

Having never dealt with this person before, with the same, happy demeanor that I usually bring to a 'higher' service request. I usually leave the ""turn it on and off again"" issues to my delightful underlings.

1364583169.0,1b9a2d,Fattie tries to be known as most athletic in the office,argumentbacker1,1433,176,141,"Ok guys

Alright. I work at an awesome company where all of my coworkers range from overweight to obese. I'm a 5'4"" 120

Never really had a problem with anyone about weight, ""at least I enjoy life"", ""mooo mooo mooo""). She's probably 5'6"" 250, and that's optomistic. This particular genus of whale was kind of self-conscious about her weight even though no one brought it up, and she liked to bring up that she was an athlete in high school. So we'll call her the Fatlete. 

Anyway Fatlete was honestly a cool person to be around, saying things like ""We should compete sometime, I'd like to see how you do"" and ""I wonder if all your working out makes you athletic like me, I'm a little heavier but I make up for it with skill""

Not sure she knows what athletic means

I captained varsity basketball back in the day and played varsity soccer too. 

Apparently she played softball. So did several other fatties in the office (does softball attract fat people?)

So last year around July the company is having a softball game for the employees. Free barbecue so of course everyone's going. HR wisely bought about 5 burgers for every person

I've never swung a bat in my life, who's probably wider than her bat, hits it pretty deep all three times. For anyone else it would be a triple or double, but she stumbles so slowly to first base it's a single. She's gasping for air and red as a beet (not that she'd know what that was) and damn near collapsing on first base.

Kind of embarrassing, just sat down and asked someone to bring her gatorade. 

Somehow in her fat-warped brain that day proved she was the best athlete in the company

This shit don't stop. For the next few weeks, ""I might eat a lot but I'm good at sports so it's okay"", ""You need to eat more for energy, that's why I was so much better than you at the softball game"".

She gets a little placard for her desk that says ""MOST ATHLETIC"".

Dieting and fitness advice starts coming out her grubby mouth: ""You shouldn't lift

I have enough so I beg HR to make the next event basketball or soccer of frisbee or anything that requires moving your legs for a continued amount of time.

Couple months later, I never told her I led my conference in scoring in womens basketball). 

We get on the court. We're on separate teams. She guards me of course, she was delusional). 

Oh god I've been praying for this.

Oh god several people are recording this game thank you thank you thank you.

Oh god I'm about the orgasm before tip off.

We win the tip off and I completely wreck the everloving shit out of Fatlete and her team. I was a one woman fast break literally EVERY possession since I had the astounding ability to run faster than a light jog.

Fatlete can't even dribble

Holy shit I'm Russell Westbrook out here. Seriously

One time she tries to chase me and literally falls flat on her face. The game is stopped for a few minutes as she doesn't get up, she's crying a little too. We all feel a little bad, then someone makes a joke about some athlete crying (sorry I don't follow football so I didn't catch the reference). Everyone laughs and we keep playing.

We win that game 16 - 0

After the game

Her stupid little placard is gone too.

So I get in and it's roughly 7:30pm, brush my teeth and everything and go to my room. A minute later, my parents are stood at my door, looking pretty pissed off. I asked what was up, and they just flipped their shit. ""WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO GET BACK FROM YOUR STUPID RUN, WE'RE ORDERING PIZZA AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT"" my mum screams, chins bouncing rhythmically with her mouth. My dad raises his voice too, and I remind them

My older sister (5'7, and they're the complete opposite, and that it's bullshit that they take it out on me. Then my dad comes out with this, ""Well it's hardly fair on us if you get into shape and we have to see you do it. We'll all be glad when you go back to university, it's not fair that we have suffer (yes, used the word suffer) while you be different.""

&gt;Starting to lose my balance

&gt;Is this a black hole?

&gt;No

&gt;Furiously sprint to break her gravitational force

&gt;Get home and check my email and see something by an ex-girlfriend from college

&gt;Oh god

&gt;Yep

&gt;She wants to see me for coffee.

&gt;Because I make terrible life decisions I say yes for some reason.

&gt;Meet for coffee

&gt;She begins secreting grease from her eyes spontaneously and wails about how she eats practically nothing she can't lose weight and I'm so fit and it's not fair

&gt;yeahright.jpg

&gt;I agree to help her and say we're going to track your calories.  You have to make a list of everything you eat.  AND NO SODA

&gt;She agrees.

&gt;We go by her place and start by weighing her.  

&gt;297 lbs.  Yikes.

&gt;I draw up a meal plan for her, a little walking, I even help her shop.  

&gt;1 week later

&gt;Go by her place and ask her how she's going.  She's raving about how much more energy she has and she's eating exactly right it must be working.

&gt;Weighin time

&gt;And the survey says...299

&gt;wat

&gt;Bursts into treats again.  ""I'LL ALWAYS BE FAT

&gt;I suspect she's been cheating but lower the calories per day to 2000 and tell her to keep at it.

&gt;1 more week passes.

&gt;I go to check in on her and she's already crying bacon fat again.  She says she now weighs 303, it's the only way.

&gt;Sit down on the couch thinking this over.  She has to be cheating on the diet.  That's the only possible answer.

&gt;Ask her ""and you ate NOTHING besides what's on the chart""

&gt;""YES""

&gt;""You swear on it""

&gt;""I SWEAR TO JEEBUS AND ALL THE SAINTS""

&gt;Racking my brain trying to figure out what went wrong

&gt;She goes into the kitchen to get something to drink

&gt;Waitaminute.jpg

&gt;""How much of that stuff are you drinking?""

&gt;""ONLY THREE BOTTLES A DAY""

&gt;oh my

&gt;I do the math and realize that's roughly 3000 calories.  Point this out.

&gt;""THOSE CALORIES DON'T COUNT

The story actually has a happy ending though.  After realizing the error of her ways she tried again a few weeks later and tried the 2500 calorie meal plan and drank only water.  Like magic

First off, but somehow my calculus professor doesn't understand that I have a doctors note and NEED TO WRITE FPS.

Lets continue where we left off: me and Jan weeping tears of laughter outside an expensive restaurant

&gt;be me and bf

&gt;just finished crying our eyes out from laughter

&gt;must go back upstairs

&gt;lock hands and walk up together

&gt;its us against the world*

&gt;*planet

&gt;relieved that dinner has been called

&gt;go into dining room

&gt;gorgeous.mahogany

&gt;table is set

&gt;look over to see Red Jumpsuit Appafatus a few seats away

&gt;throwing glares like they're doctor's orders

&gt;marvel at how she is still able squint eyes without fat caving into her eye sockets

&gt;medicalmysteries.wav

&gt;there's a really small menu

&gt;well

&gt;theres an appetizer, and dessert course, with two or three choices for each 

&gt;i settle for the vegetarian options

&gt;meanwhile Fat Folds Five is surprisingly cool

&gt; says this place finally got it right and that she should eat here more often

&gt;""good portions""

&gt;err.. alrighty. 

&gt;make eye contact with Jan and he is just as puzzled

&gt;waiter comes over and asks us which options we'd each like

&gt;Felonious Chunk's face is a pasty

&gt;""waddu u mean

&gt;the table is utterly silent as everyone registers what she says

&gt;she thought the two or three dishes per course were ALL going to be served per person

&gt;she has no idea what a prix fixe menu is

&gt;Jan makes a choking sound and it breaks the silence

&gt;look over at him 

&gt;he is almost purple in the face with effort

&gt;can't laugh can't laugh

&gt;MUST NOT LAUGH

&gt;everyone around the table is either stifling hysterics

&gt;surely she didn't think normal people at 3 dishes for four courses apiece

&gt;SideDish looks mortified

&gt;""WUT??""

&gt;""You can only have one of the three"" one of the manager almost screams at her

&gt;Aerosmithfield Hams is deep red

&gt;blimp.jpg

&gt;is clearly deeply wounded

&gt;growls at the waiter

&gt;""can i get two of one then?!!?"" nearly takes the man's head off

&gt; waiter is still stunned

&gt;his mind is visibly bending under the pressure it takes to comprehend the full glory of BananaHama

&gt;only a bark from the beast awakens the man

&gt;starts taking everyone else's orders

&gt;""CHECK NOW""

&gt;heads turn so fast all that can be heard is displaced air

&gt;""uh….""

&gt;manager looks about to blow 

&gt;waiter takes one look at her and walks out the door

&gt;what followed were minutes of absolute tension

&gt;air was so thick Bon-Bon Jovi tried to make a snack of it

&gt;manager seethingly asks her why she thought she was more important then the rest of us waiting to order. 

&gt;Milli Vanilli Ice Cream turns on the water works

&gt;excuses waft from that gaping maw like bread aroma from a bakery

&gt;fear for my metaphor as she'll try to eat that too

&gt;""AH NEED TO MAKE SURE I GET ENOUGH FOOD FOR MY THIGHROIDS""

&gt;""I'M NOT SOME 	SICK SKINNY CHILD I NEED TO EAT""

&gt;waiter comes back with two more curious looking waiters

&gt;tells Hambuwumba she can only pick one

&gt;rage. pure rage on the boar's face

&gt;starts up the blubber factory

&gt;mass ignoring of Fat Company starts

&gt;other two waiters go around to take orders

&gt;placing orders while the beast glowers

&gt;waiters leave

&gt;bf is telling manager about a drive we took out to long island 

&gt;Switch(diabetes)Foot interjects every FIVE FUCKIN SECONDS

&gt;keeps talking about how well she knows New York and how many good places she knows to eat

&gt;doesn't count

&gt;surfacearea.algebra

&gt;Bf shoots her nasty look

&gt;""we're not talking about food""

&gt;Band of Hippos looks offended and confused

&gt;clearly can't imagine *not* thinking about what to shove into her black-hole of consumption next

&gt;manager asks the company members to talk a little about the project

&gt;boring

&gt;shut up and listen to presentation

&gt;waiters bring food in about half way through bf's part (the last part) of the project

&gt;everyone else pushes plates a little bit forward

&gt;common courtesy

&gt;Talking Headcheese doesn't abide by manners established by the thin-privilege elite

&gt;instead starts chowing down 

&gt;ICola Pop shoots daggers in between dripping mouthful of mushroom and cheese

&gt;loudly announces that ""WE ALL NEED TO DIG IN GUYS""

&gt;bf counters just as loudly ""NOT DONE YET"". 

&gt;Cutting Cake Crew continues eating

&gt;Jan can't take it

&gt;The Flabulous Thunderthighs starts quivering and crying

&gt;shocker: no one cares

&gt;bf finishes up presentation 

&gt;takes five minutes

&gt; everyone starts eating

&gt;start eating my food

&gt;uh.oh

&gt;almost half way through portion (tiny portions by the way

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif) i realize the combination of watching Don Hamley scarf down her own portion and my still sensitive stomach will not end well

&gt;excuse myself as quickly as possible and almost run to the bathroom to hurl

&gt;bent over the toilet

&gt;suddenly the door opens (hadn't locked it in my haste)

&gt;goddamn it

&gt;or maybe that's her face of indigestion. hard to tell

&gt;starts wild call of…god only knows

&gt;if i hadn't been so sick I would have admired the way her stomach gracefully escaped her tent

&gt;her cankles flapped excitedly in her fishnets

&gt;next thing I know Weezer is bellowing ""I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT""

&gt;people come running 

&gt;find me being sick

&gt;people start freaking out

&gt;Jan helps me up

&gt; ""I KNEW SHE WAS A BULIMIC DO YOU SEE JAAAAAN WHAT KIND OF GIRLFRIEND IS THAT???????""

&gt;dear god

&gt;everyone is staring at her

&gt;jimmies: rustled

&gt;we interrupt this dramatic scene for more vomit

&gt;manager tells everyone to leave and go back to -

&gt;wait

&gt;people go back to the room while I wash my face in the bathroom

&gt;hear cries of rage

&gt;Tempura Trap had taken early leave and tried to eat everyone's leftover appetizers

&gt;OFF THEIR PLATES

&gt;starts wailing about portion size

&gt;laugh so hard Ialmost puke again

&gt;manager tells Jan he should take me home

&gt;Fatti Smith starts yelling ""HE CAN'T GO

&gt;manager tells her its okay

&gt;oh god

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lol.gif) i walk out of the place arm in arm with my man as Gusher struggles down the stairs

TL;DR: Hamthrax gets a verbal smack down from bf &amp; boss

**For part 2 of my delectable saga

To ensure that newcomers to this story whose condishuns prevent them from reading the back story, computer destroying, under working, over paid lard lover continue to be employed, while also allowing her to sexually harass one of my shy interns. The reason she managed to get away with it for so long, is because she was banging our Mr DesperateRomantic, a manager who had no luck with anyone ever

&gt;Jump in the lift

&gt;Learn its very hard to actually jump into

&gt;Realize they put calming music in there to prevent office shoot ups

&gt;Wait... we have no guns here!

&gt;Become both relaxed and intrigued

&gt;Exit the lift

Having reached the floor where both HR and some logistics people where working

&gt;Round final corner

&gt;No blue shell in sight!

&gt;Come up to his office

&gt;politeness.exe is still not responding

&gt;Burst in

After making ourselves comfortable in his office, and letting Dept. Heads deal with it. Not today, bozo.

&gt;""So

&gt;""N-n-no. She wasn't do-do-doing her job properly. There are certain p-protocols one has to follow when dealing with d-d-disabled people at our company""

&gt;""Oh! So what is Lard Lovers disability

&gt;Got him cornered

&gt;Dept. Head had executive access to all employee files on our system

&gt;Lard Lover had no disability filed with us

&gt;Figured after 8 years

&gt;""I-I'm not allowed to te-""

&gt;""You know that's bullshit. We both have enough clearance to see those files

&gt;""Well

&gt;""And sexual harassment isn't?! Look, threatening email, or have a talk with Lard Lover again to see where the real fact lie. And while you're at it, actually DEAL with this sexual harassment charge!""

&gt;Leave triumphantly.

Or so we thought. 

&gt;Lunch time!

&gt;Actually brought something from home

&gt;Dat tuna casserole. Best microwaved until superheated

&gt;Hear something coming from lunch room bathrooms

&gt;Two lunchrooms for the entire building. Just fuckin' great

&gt;*thud*

&gt;*thud*

&gt;*thud*

&gt;Oh god

&gt;*thud*

&gt;Enter silently

&gt;*thud*

&gt;""Ohhhh yeah

&gt;Oh my sweet sugar covered sanity...

&gt;From the disabled stall...

&gt;""Oh yes

&gt;*thuds* stop abruptly

&gt;Jump into random stall

&gt;""Ugh

&gt;""S-sure thing""

&gt;Can hear him panting quite hard

&gt;""Let's go out and get lunch. I doubt anyone will notice us gone *teehee*. Maybe to Sizzlers?""

Sizzlers is our ""all you can eat"" buffet. We don't have any others like it around here. 

&gt;Prepare to see stock prices plummet in an hour

&gt;""Snacking will help me take my mind off those goddamn IT jerks. Telling me I can't get help from them! It's THEIR computers that are fucking up! And it's none of their business that my office is kept as it is. Hell

&gt;WHAT

&gt;WHAT

&gt;My sanity was now crumpled

&gt;At least she had a 'justification' for the rubbish

&gt;If you can't eat the fast food

&gt;Hear her grumble and burp... and then...

&gt;Queef

Now, it was the wettest, loudest queef I've ever heard. If the situation were not so horrifying, I would be impressed.

&gt;""*teehee*

&gt;Explains the thuds then

&gt;Probably the most exercise she's gotten this month

&gt;Eyes watering from a mixture of the smell and a need to vomit from the noise of the queef

&gt;Just trying to pretend to poop

&gt;May not need to pretend

&gt;Finally hear them leave

&gt;Wash my hands

&gt;Curiosity overwhelms me

&gt;Look over into the disabled stall

&gt;Two used condoms

&gt;A bag of McDonalds

At this point, take it back to my desk, and pull out the sneaky flask I had in my desk draw.

&gt;Why why why why why why

&gt;Decide to try and eat a bit of casserole

&gt;Mmm

&gt;Immediately spit it out

&gt;Wash mouth out with delicious vodka

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Can't do this

&gt;Dept. Head comes in

&gt;""Hey

&gt;Oh all the flying fucks...

&gt;""And this is all coming from Mr DesperateRomantic?""

&gt;""Oh yeah. I called a few other HR managers

&gt;Stunned silence

&gt;""Well then

And that there, I remember more, and the more I want to bang my head against a wall. I'm off to do something productive, maybe.

&gt;face is now impossibly fat

&gt;let me relieve your anxiety: she has dressed appropriately for this event

&gt; this WAS a meeting of the High School Freshman Anarchy Club

&gt;not an upscale dinner full of upper-management types

&gt;fishnets under

&gt;Buffalo Winger is still unsettled by the size 

&gt;like a dog confronted with a vacuum cleaner

&gt;this is the longest carbohydrates have lingered outside her suction tube

&gt;can't take it

&gt;take Jan by the hand and search for higher

&gt;stand by the bar

&gt;there is no seating available in this area

&gt;nope.shit

&gt;the rumbling and a loud belch alerts us the the fact that Hamthrax the great requires alcohol

&gt;one of the managers cradles his face in his hands

&gt;Fat Zo orders a banana daiquiri 

&gt;what is this

&gt;the bartender looks at her uncomprehendingly

&gt;apologizes

&gt;the monster howls and summons all of her energy to scream at the poor man

&gt;stops when she sees the manager's face

&gt;pure. anger.

&gt;Hamthrax must recognize this look from that billion times she looked at her reflection after a buffet didn't restock fast enough

&gt;grumbles ""this is bullshit"" and opens her sweat-covered purse

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/fUjHBaT.gif) she pulls a greasy 2 liter of Coke from the depths of the foul smelling vacuum

&gt;Fatt &amp; Dim smiles over at him

&gt;gets about two inches from my face

&gt;""what did you say you skinny whore? I'm SO done with you making fun of me behind my back"" the whisper come out along with flecks of food and a wave of digested Coke breath

&gt;first of all

&gt;thats just spacial physics

&gt;second

&gt;point both of these thing out to her 

&gt;Jan has now lost all control

&gt;we escape with Korn Dog hot on our trail

&gt;she stops at the stairs

&gt;where is Bacon-Turner Overeater's recognition?!??!?!

&gt;tells L that woman are supposed to gain *at least a 100lbs during pregancy* 

&gt;L tries to tell her that actually you should be gaining a 1/4th of that

&gt;begin Afrosnack's tirade about how L will be the worst

&gt;""I BET YOU'D EVEN PUT YOUR KID ON A *DIET*""

&gt;L tells her she would

&gt; is immediately hit with accusations of child abuse

&gt;L rolls her eyes and turns to put her tuna salad in the fridge

&gt;""ARE YOU GOING TO EAT JUST TUNA FISH??! WITH NO BREAD?""

&gt; Cheap Thick looks at L like she just committed murder

&gt;""I'm trying to lose weight

&gt;L doesn't give a shit

&gt;gotta make $$ for that baby

&gt; when lunch time rolls around

&gt;gets to the fridge…

&gt;her vision becomes tunneled

&gt;the music builds

&gt;the tuna… it's not there

&gt;but… she had left it

&gt;L looks around the fridge

&gt;no

&gt;her tuna is gone

&gt;hungry, the beta switch is off

&gt;there is a loaf of bread on the counter

&gt;logically

&gt;approaches Misfats

&gt;""Hey Hamthrax.""

&gt;""WHUT""

&gt;""Is that a tuna salad sandwich?""

&gt;Meatload looks up 

&gt; ""YEAH"" and takes another bite

&gt;L

&gt;knocks the sandwich out of her hands onto the floor

&gt;points at those bewildered beady eyes with a fork

&gt;""Listen you fat pig, and haven't slept in a month. How about you go and eat yourself into a food coma with your own tuna""

&gt; Major Lazy looks at her

&gt;""And if you even *try* to accuse me of bullying or take my food again, and eat it in front of you, you giant waste of space""

""And she never even dared to look me in the eye after that"". Me and Jan stared at her in awe as she casually finished wiping her son's hands with a napkin.

Open on a typical municipal office break room

An average-looking fellow in a button-down shirt and slacks is putting food into the shared refrigerator.  He swings the door shut

From the front, which is about 3 popped seams away from violating public decency laws. 

Gloria Bosom is holding a bright green plastic bucket

Button-down Fellow steps back with a mumbled polite greeting

Gloria Bosom leans over to place the bucket on the bottom shelf of the fridge.  As she does

The bucket contains something which at first appears to be a mass of wet muddy sand.  

On closer inspection

Off-white cake

The handle of a cheerful little yellow shovel is sticking up from the pile of bucket-cake.

The door of the fridge swings closed.  

Gloria Bosom leaves without comment. 

**doinkdoink**

Later that day. 

The Button-down Fellow is now enjoying a break outside.  He is describing the bucket-of-cake scene to one of his coworkers

Suddenly they are interrupted:

""You know

Another coworker has overheard the conversation.  Enter Ralph

""I've seen cakes like that on Food Network.  You make a cake in a pail and frost it to look like a beach with some waves

Oo...kay.  I mean sure.  Not everyone could win Cake Wars

""Why is it your business anyhow?"" Ralph wants to know. ""Why would you need to shame someone for their food choices?""  

It's a bucket of cake, we're sorry for gossipping.

""Everyone at this office is so anorexic

This office features free donuts in the break room and has pizza parties for ""team building and morale"" about twice a month. 

""Yes

They're probably just making sure everyone gets to have a slice or two before anybody goes back for seconds.

""No

Seriously Ralph

""Skinny people like you guys wouldn't know anything about the discrimination faced by persons of size

(Persons Of Unusual Size? Is this the Fire Swamp?  Let's not say that out loud.)

Button-down Fellow attempts empathy

It's not effective.

""Being gay is totally different

Words fail.

""Persons of size still have to fight for fairness against all the bigotry.""

(In actuality, it is open knowledge that Ralph got special dispensation from the dress code because he insisted it was too expensive to buy dress shirts and sport coats tailored to his size.)

""Have you heard of NAAFA?"" Ralph is really getting into gear now.

Oh would you look at the time?  We better get back to work!

Afternoon at the office.  Time for one more cup of caffeine to help get through these last few hours.  To the break room!

Gloria Bosom is already there

Gloria turns to return the greeting

She is eating the cake/frosting mess with the yellow plastic shovel.

I never expected my retribution to come so quick for laughing at this woman's response to me telling her that she was prohibited from receiving anymore equipment from IT unless she proved that she would treat it correctly

After my poor underling came back (He never broke anything again) and told me of the barrage of insults he received against him and his manhood from this female worker, and the downright nasty remarks, and calling a 16 year old boy a ""Small dicked hazard to society"" is stepping over the line. I don't care if you mention boobies and dicks, just don't mention anyone's specific boobies or dicks in the workplace, easy kind of thing to follow.

It was quitting time (of the same day that my last story occurred) and I decide to give up on trying to help this woman any further until I had a few stiff drinks and an 8 hour sleep. Before I leave, her department head, and HR. The poor boy was mortified, so I was trying to keep it on the down low as possible, to see if we can get it sorted without the usual 'office gossip'.

At the time, an introverted man with close to no people skills (rather a strange job for him to be in, but he got the job done), and had absolutely no luck with the ladies. After recalling memories of him bragging about a 'larger' woman that he had been enjoying his nights with, I found the inescapable conclusion as to how the fuck she knew about this complaint... he was sleeping with the manager to keep her job and gather information.

This is where the Zeus analogy kicks in, to even consider such desperate actions as an option.

My last post was more depressing than funny so I've decided to tell you about my experience in a UK Subway a few months ago that even to this day leaves my jimmies rustled.

This takes place at a Subway 5 minutes walk from a city university. Pretty well frequented by the local student and staffed almost exclusively with students right to the management level.

&gt;Ordering my sandwich.

&gt;Ham and turkey flatbread

&gt;Aw yis.

&gt;Suddenly the lights start to flicker

&gt;Foot long BBQ rib on herb and cheese bread, double pepper cheese. Extra grated cheese on top.

&gt;I sit down and start eating my flatbread. Genuinely fascinated. The beast was a fine specimen. 5'6 at most and must be well over 400 pounds.

&gt;NIM sheepishly approaches the salad section. Eyes it as though it wishes to do him serious harm.

&gt;""No salad

&gt;Nearly choke on a piece of gherkin while stifling a laugh. Can barely breath. The beast might be onto something.

&gt;Finally

&gt;""Well I've got the money in the account so obviously your chip and pin machines broken

&gt;I used that machine 5 minutes ago. It's working fine.

&gt;Fine gentleman behind the desk tells him the location of the nearest cash machine. 2 minute walk away. They'd be happy to keep the sandwich warm until he gets back.

&gt;NIM is not having it. Demands his sandwich for free. 

&gt;Is told no. If he doesn't want to pay they'll throw the sandwich out and he gets nothing.

&gt;NIM storms out. Stops at the door and yells how he shouldn't have to take this crap from a fucking sandwich maker.

I'm just going to skip the ""last week on Escape from Hamplanet"" and jump into a muggy August day last year.Thanks /u/culofiesta

&gt;Me and BF are slowly roasting in our apartment when he gets a call from a coworker. 

&gt;BBQ at Hamthrax's 

&gt;she has a pool

&gt;we decide to go, and a giant helping of whale blubber

&gt;take my car because Nine Inch Sandwich lives out in bumfuck nowhere

&gt;I have a pretty small car

&gt;We swing by store to grab a sixpack

&gt;courtesy.mpeg

&gt;arrive to what is a small

&gt;find street parking about 3 blocks away

&gt;knock at door

&gt;suddenly the wine begins to ripple like crazy

&gt;bf wiggles away

&gt;Hunger crosses Alice in Spanks face as she smirks at me ""no need to be shy here roomsgotrooms

&gt;jokes on her

&gt;smile and nod my head

&gt;invites us inside

&gt;realizes burgers are veggie

&gt;mini tornado collects against her sides and crashes against us

&gt;the smell hits us full force; sweat

&gt;scent of grease and burned food hits as Fatley Crue waves her arms trying to signal some type of Hambeast airstrike 

&gt;[here's a quick visual of her as she starts her welping](http://i.imgur.com/hXSHe8k.jpg)

&gt;tells us these burgers are extremely unhealthy and how could we bring that into her house

&gt;bunch of people are there, or eating. 

&gt;Guy from office is maning the grill, to Hamthrax's irritation

&gt;we walk over to some friends

&gt;bf not feeling this idea

&gt;starts despreatly pawing at his chest

&gt;ask bf if he wants to go into pool with me

&gt;take off my cover up

&gt;bf and some bros cannonball into pool

&gt;misses slightly

&gt;we're just splashing about

&gt;we are worried a truck has broken through the gates and is heading for the pool

&gt;nope

&gt;looks like each limb of her body is trying to jump ship in unison.

&gt;her chins roll up so she bares resemblance to a fleshy bundle of newspapers

&gt;starts pathetically jogging to edge of pool

&gt;ohgod.yahweh

&gt;our faces are a portrait of horror as it dawns on us what will happen

&gt;we are too late

&gt; our eyes lock onto the gelatinous jiggle pile

&gt;but nothing compares to the sheer panic when we realize where she will land

&gt;i look at my boyfriend

&gt;she is on a direct course to his fragile body

&gt;i whisper ""i love you""

&gt;he blanches

&gt;like an agile dolphin

&gt;My Chemical Romincemeat Pie crashes into the pool

&gt; I have never nor will i ever hear a sound as wrenching and painful as the one made by her bare thigh meat as it collided against the water 

&gt;neighbors look over fence wondering if North Korea did in fact launch that nuke

&gt;me and bf cling to each other

&gt;Judas Beast rears her head

&gt;starts bouncing up and down in the water

&gt;doesn't notice the havoc she has wreaked upon her own pool

&gt;puddles of water slosh out on to the ground

&gt;people have stopped eating as her ""teehees"" echo the yard

&gt;Rage against the Diet Machine zeroes in on bf and me

&gt;trundles up to us

&gt;""hey JAN want to play chicken?"" 

&gt;we scramble out of the water so fast we almost shatter the water molecules

&gt;run to grill to eat

&gt;should have known this was the worst place to hide

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/M5DdH.gif) she heaves her carcass from the water and lumbers toward us

&gt;we turn away to get food

&gt;grill man quickly tells us to stay away from the potato salad as Hamastodon made it

&gt;find the creation he is describing in a giant tub

&gt;steer clear, see people have been eating them

&gt;asks for two patties and a sausage

&gt;watch Children of Bacon assemble a genocide of a burger

&gt;hand goes towards mayo

&gt;vomit.avi

&gt;Ziggy Bacondust and the Hamplanets like Mars chows down at a disgusting speed

&gt;bf asks me if i want to go soon

&gt;Deathrace Burger King starts whining about how we can't go yet

&gt;jesustakethewheel.flac

&gt;we want to leave

&gt;thankfully she doesn't

&gt;starts playing Beyonce's Crazy In Love and dancing

&gt;by dancing i mean gyrating so hard that several chairs gravitate over and join her orbit

&gt;Nopenopenope Smarshmellow Mouth has gone too far.

Okay I am so sorry this is unbearably long. At this point, and was trying to get a female coworker to hang out at his place /me and bf wingmaning it up/. so we decide to stay for MAX 1 hour.

&gt;while watching in the jelly wobbling show in horro someone approaches us and asks us if it's true we have a car

&gt;apparently Beheamamoth didn't think to buy any beer for everyone

&gt;we volunteer to drive over to somewhere to grab some with the guy who asked

&gt;Meatsled Zepplin sees us leaving

&gt;soaking wet Fat Benetar says she HAS to go get beers

&gt;alrightythen.mp4

&gt;we make Snack Sabbath put on a shirt and and grab towels to accommodate her sopping wet tundra of an ass

&gt;there are four of us and bf calls shotgun with the vigilance of a man knowing the fate that will await him if he dares sit within two feet of her

&gt;then the most beautiful thing happened

&gt;Chin Lizzy couldn't get into the Prius

&gt;SHE COULD NOT FIT INTO THE CAR

&gt;it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen

&gt;she followed it up by kicking the car and saying it was a bullshit piece of trash that probably wasn't safe to drive

&gt;ALLOFMYSIDES.HALP

Jesus this is a novel. She stalked back home humiliated

1371777599.0,1grlt2,Psychology with a a side of pork,Combustablesquirrel,1298,243,246,"Some of you might remember my last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3nj0/a_hamplanet_and_moon_orbit_into_the_clinic/). This one is a lot more recent. 

Be a 27 year old cripple. Gimping around on my spiffy cane and going to school on the GI Bill. [Feelsgoodman.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W44FPOk.jpg)

Finishing up my Psych minor with a couple of summer classes. One was a 4000 level cognitive psychology course. It's balls out tough

The professor starts in with the intro and lets us know what's expected of us. The dude was actually really cool. He started off by saying the first day was the easy day and he wanted to get to know us and for us to get to know each other

Five minutes late, today is a freebie, but you need to be on time for this class. We're going to be moving fast and you can't afford to miss anything"". ""I have four kids. I'm doin' my best here!"" she replied in a waaay too loud voice. 

Unlike a lot of college kids, that goes a long way come grading time. So I have the front four seater table to myself. I'm a grade whore(Honestly, you're paying for me to be there with taxes, so I kind of owe it to you to try and do well).

So four empty seats in a row. Where does she sit? Right the fuck next to me. Fucking hell. So we start meeting each other and the professor comes to each group to talk to us. My first conversation with T3Y set the tone for the course. 

""So what happened to your leg there?""

""It was a parachuting accident in the army""

""Oh cool""(Seriously... Cool?)

""Um. Yeah. So anyway

""My brother is with Delta Force at Ft.Sill""

""...""

""He's a bad ass""

""That's not where Delta is based out of""

""Pff

For the record. I was in Ranger recon. I kinda knew for a fact that she was full of shit

Till later that week. 

I was in the hall before class and studying with a very sweet girl. I brought a breakfast of mixed fruit to eat before class and I had made her a plate out of the top of the container. I heard the handicap elevator open and out strolls T3Y. Mind you

She strolls on over and seriously looked at the fruit and looked at Sweet Girl and said ""Eeeww. Why do you eat that stuff? You don't need to get any skinnier."" then looked at me and said ""Honey

Blinding rage. Sweet Girl was actually having problems with her boyfriend who was active duty in the army and suffering from PTSD. He was drifting away from her and she was worried about him. She told this to her friend after class and T3Y butted in and got all of the info. I had only recently heard about it because she asked me about my experience with PTSD in relationships.

Oh

""I can't fucking believe you.""

""What?""

""She's going through some tough shit right now and you decide that you can just fuck with her head? For what? I'm not getting with her. I'm **damn** sure not getting with you! What the fuck would make you think that's ok?!""

She just shrugged ""I'm just sayin

If that had been a guy

Class started and she tried to sit next to me and I said

So the professor just starts in with class. Fast paced and all. The tubby fuck pulls out a ""breakfast"". I don't know how a bag of Doritos qualifies but that's my best guess given the time of day. 

The professor started getting sidetracked by the crunching and straight up said ""Alright

""I have a thyroid condition. I have to eat. You can't tell me I can't or I'll make a complaint""

My time to shine motherfucker

""If she does have a medical condition

[Awww Yeah](http://imgur.com/gnuSg)

Fatty tries to tell me ""Well my cousin's a doctor and-""

Professor ""and he doesn't work here. Put it away or leave."" 

She left. She was absent for three days of material for a bag of Doritos.

Later in the course, I mean, mid-sentence, T3Y piped up ""Why don't they just get over it? Things ain't that bad"" 

Even the professor was like ""What the he... um

""People just need to get over it. I watch this show

Sweet Girl spoke up ""Sir

Fist Bump

To ease this pain

And for the grand finale. On the day of the final. T3Y actually saw all of us in the hallway and asked if we would give witness statements against the professor. She was failing the course and she (I'm not making this up) said it was because he discriminates against fat people. Everyone basically told her to fuck off. I actually loved a fellow classmate, I'm bigger than you and I've never had less than a B on an exam"". Fat Black Girl actually raised her hand and told the professor what T3Y was planning before the final. 

So

**Edit:** Thank you guys for giving me positive feedback. I tend to keep to myself most of the time. But getting well wishes here does help me keep moving out there. Thanks again.

&gt;I'm impatient as fuck so bike rides are always full on sprints. No leisure. All business. Got places to be. 

&gt;At work I'm the resident IT guy

&gt;Move causes round of hiring as we're getting busier. 

&gt;Office is now inhabited by a multi-person hamplanetary-system

&gt;Celestial fatties orbiting their star

&gt;And since the weight of themselves fighting their own gravity was so great

&gt;The office kitchen she had stocked was always full of typical fatty-construction-materials. The basic building blocks that form hamplanets. Gallon jug of mayo, etc. Also, lots of noble gas in that area and the bathrooms at all times. 

&gt;Fatties begin to hate themselves and decide to have weightloss contest. 

&gt;[thisgonbgood](http://i.imgur.com/SzpOIQC.gif)

&gt;I'm genuinely excited to see them all wanting to better themselves. So with more tears than you would believe if I described them

&gt;They start a chart with everyone's current weight

&gt;This is where my struggles truly begin. As they get to my name

&gt;[ofw](http://i.imgur.com/yZVgO8S.gif) Hamplanets realize how much smaller I am than everyone else. 

&gt;I feel sudden gravitational shift. The orbits have changed.  I'm singled out suddenly

&gt;Suddenly

&gt;two weeks pass. 

&gt;Second weigh-in.  Numbers are climbing. Fatties have been cheating. I climb on the scale

&gt;angryplanets.gif

&gt;This kicks it off truly.  I'm not yet aware the extent to which the bullying will be taken. 

&gt;Bring my lunch to work every day

&gt;Not aware that in the two weeks the office fridge had filled back up with exactly the same products, and still butter, because fatties. Low-calorie cookies, candies, and treats.

&gt;I notice because I'm bringing in more salads lately. Getting creative with them. Place one in fridge with my name on it. Get my ass to work. 

&gt;I start to observe office snacking habits. I suppose fatty logic is the Newtonian physics for this solar system. Because low calorie

&gt;I have some internal lulz

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/7KIPIad.jpg) I walk to the fridge and see my salad tub is empty.

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/hmOVst7.gif) I find the carcass of my lunch in the trash can. 

&gt;Fury doesn't describe it.

&gt;For the next 4 days

&gt;I fail at finding the fat cunt who's doing this. Celestial wastebanded boss doesn't care. She's actually my prime suspect. 

&gt;Verbal abuse accelerates as days pass.  My girlfriend f/24/5'3""/125 comes in for lunch with me a few days. They berate her. 

&gt;She's not rail thin or anything, not fatty logic curves. Just plain Sexy. 

&gt;The sight of her causes hamplanetary misalignment. They can't handle seeing a girl who's actually ""curvy""

&gt;This gets to her quickly as she'd only recently finally started to feel good about her body after losing some weight.  We start eating at a place we know the fatties will never go

&gt;One night I'm working on a coworker's computer after she had left. I was minimizing windows of food porn

&gt;The whole office was talking about me behind my back. Talking about how obnoxious I was

&gt;And how they should start locking the bathrooms to make sure I wasn't going in their to throw up the snacks the office paid for. 

&gt;Un...Fucking...Believable.

&gt;Stars align. Get email shortly after from a company I used to work for wanting me to come back. More money. Fewer hours. Fewer hambeasts. 

&gt;I decide it's time to get real revenge. I'm always the first one in the office

&gt;Bring superglue on Friday. 

&gt;Wait til everyone leaves. 

&gt;Open fridge and turn temperature up to non food safe levels. Same for freezer. 

&gt;Superglue doors shut.

&gt;Superglue snack cabinet shut. 

&gt;Done with the kitchen. 

&gt;Next

&gt;""I'm unhappy because I eat

&gt;Wait for Monday.

&gt;First one in office. 

&gt;First hamplanet gets to work

&gt;Pulls fridge door. Nothing. Freezer door. Nothing. Snack cabinet

&gt;Engage freakout. Calls boss. Everything's broken. No snacks. From the tone of the squeeling

&gt;More hamplanets reach orbit. Boss waddles in. Has had enough. Needs her mahfuckin snacks. She wraps the nebulous fat of her hand around the fridge handle

&gt;Orbit lost. Hamplanets start careening in to each other. physics are gone. Their universe is collapsing around them. They begin slingshotting around each other's gravities to gain momentum. 

&gt;The sounds of wheezing and labored breathing are so loud they'd be audible in the vacuum of space.

&gt;One ham colossus kicks the snack cabinet in fury. The momentum of her pendulous mercury-filled foot shatters the door. 

&gt;[mrw](http://i.imgur.com/8VI4riF.gif) I see this happen. 

&gt;[trw](http://i.imgur.com/tQFUWYY.gif) They see something at all to eat. 

&gt;After that

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/Uh41GN2.gif) I'm trying to push through all of the insulted celestial bodies. 

&gt;I drop off my resignation letter and bolt. None of them can catch me. So angry.

As I drive

She happens to mention she is single, she knows she's overweight, but makes up for it with a personality that is larger than life.

So I ask

""yeah"" she replies

The conversation goes on about her failed love life, yeah I know this one guy, he's lovely. She asks me to describe him.

""He's really fun, life of the party""

""No no no"" she stops me ""what does he look like?""

""What does that matter?"" I ask

""Well

""Well, short hair, clean shaven""

""No

""What?!"" I exclaim

""300lbs is too big for me

I'm now pretty stunned by her hypocrisy ""could you not see past his weight

She comes back with ""No

So I ask ""so what's your perfect guy look like then?""

""Oh you know (tee hee) slender, bit of stubble""

I ask ""so you won't settle for a bigger guy even if he has a good personality

She says ""no

I say ""no it's not

""No

1375891740.0,1jw2io,Hamplanets On A Plane,ScramblesTD,1303,282,263,"Long time lurker first time poster


I had recently returned home to the US after being away on business

I got lucky and scored myself a window seat as well scoring myself some friendly traveling companions in the form of a dude in his late teens, small children begin to cry and I'm sure the pilot's altimeter dropped a few feet as lo and behold Jabba the fuckin' Hutt and that little rat alien boarded the plane. Jabba stood around 6'  and she must have weighed, easily, 500-600lbs, and the smaller - I use that term lightly - creature looked no older than 10 but was nearly as big around has her mother's massive legs. Not to pick on a child like a jackass, but this kid was basically the brat you see in movies involving plane flights. In the event of a crash she could have been a flotation device for all I cared, but this is Fat People Stories, so that's a tale for another day. 

Anyways, wasn't in *nearly* enough pain for her liking, Jabba requested beer and snacks. She was politely informed by the stewardess that perhaps it would be best if she waited until the plane were airborne before ordering any drinks. Jabba grew frustrated and almost summed up enough energy to fully get up from her seat and **demanded** that she be fed and consume drinks due to her beetus. As someone with type 2 diabetes as well as basic common sense, I can confirm that alcohol is probably not the greatest choice when you're worried about things like blood sugar. Regardless Jabba gets what Jabba wants, be it Han Solo or Heineken. As we waited to take off, Jabba and Jabba Jr became more and more assertive and straight up fucking rude to the girl serving them. During one of Jabba's rants, CB makes a comment along the lines of getting on another plane if the service on this one wasn't up to the Enormous One's standards. Jabba, rose from the carcass of what used to be a proper chair and stepped into the isle; pushing away the stewardess with a sweep of her flabby arm to berate CB for not respecting her disability.  He actually called her The Enormous One

Well fatty fatty boombalatty is having a difficult time, and just her reaching for the belt sent Jabba flying off the handle. She roared with the voices of legion and jumped to her feet with surprising and terrifying agility swatting the poor girl in the face with one arm and grabbing her with the other. Her watch nicked the stewardess in the face and caused a pretty gnarly nose bleed. CB stands and demands, with a surprising amount of calm authority that Jabba let the girl go. Jabba responds by dropping the n-bomb and delivering another blow. At this point people began to stand up, and a few men further up were getting ready to come back here and put a whooping on Jabba. It should be noted that the smaller beast was clapping and cheering during all of this. Just as BB and I begin to stand, CB jumps up and grabs Jabba by the throat while working his way behind her, attempting to pulling her backwards. Jabba backpeddles into a seat, catching CBs hip on painfully on the plastic arm rest. BB stands up and, nails Jabba in the side of the head with his closed laptop. I start to work my way around BB and just as this looks like it's about to turn into a full on riot

I'm 21 y/o chick, working my way down. Boyfriend is from Belgium, 25, works in IT. He's 5'10 and super thin due to being a nerd all the time. I love him anyways. So he tells me that theres a hamplanet at his job who's really into metal music, referred to henceforth as  Hamthrax. Hamthrax has a really hard time keeping away from my bf, apparently very into his accent. Boy is like meatwagon bait for some reason. Greentext activated.

&gt;Move shit around in my schedule to go over and have lunch with him

&gt;BF really excited to show me the majesty that is Hamthrax

&gt;Sit down with him in large cafeteria on the main floor of the office building. By large

&gt;could probably ride a horse through some of those gaps

&gt;Eating with BF(we're both ~~vegetarians~~ pescetarians) when suddenly there is a terrifying rumble

&gt;earth shakes

At this point, ignores me even though I offer her a hand. She plops down onto the seat to the side of us and throws what I assume is the worlds largest deli sandwich on the table. Neither of us had invited her to sit with us but looks like she took it upon her massive self to join us.

&gt;Hamthrax unwraps sandwich to reveal the destruction of an entire deli counter

&gt;more meat and cheese then I've ever seen between two pieces of bread

&gt;mayonaise dripping from the edges

&gt;Cream Theater immediately crams it into her mouth and starts talking with her mouth full and her chins quaking.

&gt;keeps talking about death metal concert coming up

&gt;eyes my salad with disgust

&gt;asks me what music i'm into

&gt;barely have time to utter ""mostly rock and some indie and trance""

&gt;Meatallica cuts me off and starts berating me 

&gt;bf is huge trance fan

&gt;""Lol well trance is pretty good JAN""

&gt;mfw uncomfortable glances

&gt;continues to talk about ""MUH CURVES"" and about how you NEED to eat meat or you're not healthy.

&gt;spend next twenty minutes listening to diatribes of Slayer Cake while she flirts with BF

&gt;BF's eyes have become glazed over in boredom

&gt;I become worried Hamthrax might think they're doughnuts and chow down

Eventually the nightmare ended, crushing the life force from his frail bones. She smirks and waves bye to me, winking at BF. Many stories following!

&gt;See TubaGirl. She lost a significant amount of weight. Now about 5'5 and 110 pounds.


&gt;Looks not sick though. Tell her how much healthier she looks.


&gt;Turns out she had Celiac Disease and gluten was making her sick. No gluten = no sickness.


&gt; Enter FlagHam. 5'2 and 350 pounds. All concentrated on her hips and ass. Practically a shelf. Would be ok


&gt;no girl no.


&gt; Sits with us at lunch. Total Beta


&gt;TubaGirl gets gluten-free pizza made special by the cafeteria workers.


&gt;FlagHam comments on the pizza looks gross and not like pizza.

I lived in California at the time and understood why they called it the land of the beautiful people... until I got to the Call Center. Apparently that was where all the obese Cali people were hiding.


Out of our team of 9 people I was the only one in shape. The others were all Large and In Charge


I say Large and In Charge because although they were over-weight none of them really had what I would call fat-logic. 2 of them hiked together on weekends


They knew they were fat but didn't care


""An hour on the lips


""Hour?! Dude


Again


Hammie stole other peoples lunches and, or file sexual harassment claims against the person who complained. (Hammie and I were the only females in our team.)


My new co-workers warned me about this my very first day.


It wasn't that I didn't believe them


I was wrong.


I hadn't even worked there a full day before Hammie ate my lunch and



I requested compensation so that I could purchase another lunch.
Hammie


I declined and again requested compensation only to be told that she had given me a solution and it was my own fault for not accepting it.


This did not sit well with me so I went to HR and requested assistance in resolving this issue.


Hammie was called in and I explained, about my allergies and the fact that I was several thousand dollars in debt. I could not afford another lunch that day, nor could I afford to have this happen again.


Hammie had eaten my allergen free lunch


Hammie refused and HR


I accepted


Hammie exploded. Tears


HR asked me to drop it and just let it go.


I refused. Told him Hammie was no better than a High School Bully who had stolen my lunch money and I am too old to put up with that sort of behavior.


Hammie continued to yell. Threatened to sue the company for discrimination against fat people if she was punished. Would take to Facebook and Twitter (it was the pre-Tumblr days) and drum up a social media backlash. 


I told her she was welcome to and if she did


I then took my green card out of my wallet and calmly laid it on the table in front of her


""Did you assume I was American simply because I'm fair skinned? That is a little racist, struggling immigrant with food allergies who is doing her best to dig herself out from a pile of debt or a fat, racist, discriminatory bully?""


Californians just love to get behind the cause of a minority being victimized.


Hammie was silent as she realised she had no recourse. Prop 8 was big in the news right at that moment so she couldn't even pull her usual sexual harassment bullshit. If she did she'd be cast as the wicked Hetero trying to set up a hard working bi-sexual who just wanted to be left alone.


HR, according to the employee handbook I had just read, all incidences of theft would result in instant termination unless she wanted to repay me for my lunch, at which point I would consider the matter a loan rather than a theft.


Hammie pulled a slightly damp and musky smelling $10 from her pants pocket (ew!) and gave it to me.


I thanked her and left the office.


I'd like to say she never stole another persons lunch but I'd be lying if I did. She never stole MY lunch again

In which you learn about Maggie's patriotism.

My friends and I wanted to throw a nice, and a literal cash cow parked in our living room. Unfortunately, due to a family crisis of Sasha's, we had to push our Fourth of July party to the the fourth of August, but that way more people were free, anyhow. We let Maggie know as soon as we started planning, and told her to invite her friends. The actual quote was ""I don't really celebrate bougie holidays like that; I've got *too much to do*."" Hilarious. So we asked her if she wanted to chip in for the barbecue, yeah this is why we kept her around.

We bought more food than any sane person should. But we knew we had to clog Maggie's mouth hole to have any left for ourselves. We stocked up on sausage, veggies, various buns, snacks on snacks on snacks, and tons, tons of booze. A couple of my coworkers, and my boss from my bar/restaurant were coming and bringing shitty beer for the masses. But me and John weren't taking any chances. Our last stop was a giant, with some thematic icing. We were waiting to check out

We had invited about 20, and wiping down yard furniture while me, John, and Andy prepped food. Maggie spent the ~~morning~~ afternoon watching Doctor Who and making comments about how we were all people pleasers. For having a party. We were all just fooling around, and playing our ""White Girl Wasted"" playlist (sorrynotsorry) around the house. This did not please the most high Maggie. The highlight of that playlist was John's emphatic and soulful  sing along performance of [Birthday Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y34jC4I1m70).  It's accompanied by a lot of stupid dancing and general shenanigans. The best line in this song is arguably ""Bad bitch contest, you in first place"". John shimmed over to Maggie and dedicated those lines to her. Maggie got so mad that she actually left the room, and came back with her speakers. She proceeded to blast ""Rubber Soul"". We just stared at her. Immediate wet blanket

When people started arriving, but most people were in some form of summer clothing. We had a crappy inflatable kiddie pool and a slip'n'slide, so a bunch of people were in bathing suits, not everyone though. When the smells of food starting wafting, Maggie came out. She was in shorts. This was the first time I'd ever seen her thighs. Cottage cheese could not even describe it. She was still wearing her giant t-shirts, so it wasn't *awful*. I don't think anyone else made comments or anything. But she stalked around the party, glaring at all of our friends. We couldn't even introduce her to anyone

When the food was ready, a rack of ribs, three cobs of corn drenched in butter, and a bag and a half of potato chips. She was concentrating on drinking as much beer as humanly possible. I don't think anyone was counting, but my boss came up to me and said ""If she wasn't a … *big girl*, I'd be trying to get her to the ER"". The party carried on, there was plenty of alcohol. I wasn't too sober myself, cake smeared Maggie, screaming ""YOU BITCH"" and ran into her room. 

What. I helped John wipe the cake off his face and shirt and he told me that he'd come into the kitchen to find Maggie taking the Decoy bait, calling him a fat shamer. John tried to play it off, telling her he was laughing because there was cake on her nose. Maggie was pretty well stocked on liquid courage, and said something like ""well, you can come clean it off."" John immediately said no, no thank you, I don't want any cake. Her response was to run at him and smash her face into his. She attempted to kiss him, and she started crying about how she thought they were meant for each other, 21 year old well-read rhinoceros

After he finished telling me the story, it was the funniest thing I had ever heard. John tried had to hold me up, but we were laughing so hard,we kind of collapsed onto the kitchen floor. Our late-coming, cake bearing friend opened the door around that time, screaming ""The CAKE IS HERE"". Maggie was out of her room in a flash, momentarily fine at the mention of more dessert. This made me and John laugh harder than ever, tangled on the kitchen floor

The rest of the party was so much fun, oh wow good job). She then pretended she blacked out that night, which would have been plausible if she didn't turn bright red when John walked into the room. It was even more obvious when he sat on the armrest of my chair, and she threw her empty plate into the sink, and left the room.

FPS

I didn't think I would write another part tonight

When we last picked up our story

About three weeks passed and there weren't many incidents.  Alicia and I were locked into summer classes and working.  Outside of an occasional hour here or there, one class was on Monday and Wednesday, the other was Tuesday and Thursday, giving him Friday-Sunday away from classes) and still working two part time jobs.  I honestly don't know how he did it, and he managed to spend time with us when he could.  The good thing, though, was that the summer session was almost over and we had a nice break until Fall session began.

Daisy, who brushed them off very well.  After Alex left for class, she usually went to the kitchen and gorged herself before parking herself in the living room and using the awesome setup we had for her own amusement.  Alicia and I didn't say anything about it because we were too busy studying, but when classes were over, we were going to want to use it too.  Finals week was now upon us and the Sunday after, Alex decided to take everyone out for dinner for the first real roommate dinner.

&gt;Me

&gt;Did pretty well.  A and B in my classes.  Happy!

&gt;Alex got two As.  The guy is a machine.  Has to be.

&gt;Alicia got two As.  Not as surprising.

&gt;Daisy...well

&gt;Dressed up for awesome night out.

&gt;Alex said to.  Love dressing up!

&gt;Choose black one piece.  Showing off dem sexy curves!

&gt;Alicia chooses similar outfit.  Also a sexy bitch!

&gt;Both come downstairs together

Alex gave a hearty whistle and growl when he saw us.  He opted for a dark blue dress shirt and black pants.  He was attractive

&gt;Three of us ready

&gt;Hear rumbling from far away

&gt;Well

&gt;Jurassic Park ain't got nothing on this

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5544-you-have-to-spoon-me-first) Daisy comes into view

Daisy's idea of getting dressed up was to throw this obnoxiously loud flowered shirt on that showed a disgusting amount of fat cleavage and black stretch pants.  Alex coughed to stifle what he saw and turned away.

&gt;that which has been seen....

&gt;Bellowing commences

&gt;""ALLLLEEEXXXXX DAMN YOU LOOK HOT!""

&gt;charging like a rhino

&gt;Alex puts his hand up

&gt;rhino can't stop momentum

&gt;Manages to slow down and just flail a hug at him

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;Hooooo boy.

&gt;Blubbering starts to commence.

&gt;""BUT YOU ARE SO NICE TO ME!! I THINK YOU ARE JUST PLAYING HARD TO GET!!""

&gt;gag.gif

&gt;No way Alex would do that.

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;Alicia showing initiative and awesomeness

&gt;I agree quickly.

&gt;Alex nods quickly.

&gt;Blubbering avoided.

Alex had followed through with buying his new car, very politely, that the car was his baby.  He had traded in an old Civic that still looked pretty good, even though it was like seven years old.  He loved his car.

&gt;Called shotgun

&gt;Blubbering starts yet again

&gt;""BUT I WANTED THE FRONT SEAT I WANTED TO SIT NEXT TO ALEX!!!""

&gt;sigh....

&gt;Alex chimes in before anything starts

&gt;""Shotgun rule

&gt;Awesome roomie is awesome

&gt;Alicia kinda upset

&gt;""FINE! YOU'RE JUST LIKE JEALOUS OF ME AND ALEX ANYWAYS!""

&gt;...did you blackout about two minutes ago?

&gt;Never mind

&gt;Alex starts laughing in the front as we pull out.

&gt;Daisy oblivious to what's so funny.

I said in the last chapter that Alex spoiled us, after all, I was convinced he didn't have a mean bone in his body.  He took us to this beautiful restaurant that was a rather fine dining fitted for seafood.  Fresh lobster, crab, shrimp, you name it.  Alicia and I had heard of it but couldn't afford it.  It was about 30 bucks a plate on average.  Alicia and I half-heartedly protested because we knew it was expensive.  Alex simply shook his head and said he insisted.  Daisy, of course

&gt;""OH MY GOD I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT HERE!  LET'S GO!""

&gt;I do too...but have to at least be concerned for roomie paying for everything

&gt;Alicia happy as hell.  Bitch loves seafood.

&gt;I love seafood.

&gt;Protests subsided.

&gt;Alex looks glad everyone is happy

We walk in and it appears that Alex is friends with the hostess, but was very nice.  Alex explained that he knew her from high school and they were good friends that had just lost touch a bit during college.  She shows us to our table.  At least, she showed three of us...

&gt;This place is soooo nice

&gt;Can't wait to taste the food

&gt;There's our table

&gt;Wait...

&gt;Where's Daisy

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5436-loose-seal) I see her at the lobster tank

Daisy was putting her face against the lobster tank

&gt;Looking at the menu

&gt;Place is expensive

&gt;Everything looks so good

&gt;Alicia's smile hasn't gone down

&gt;Best friend looks absolutely giddy

&gt;Daisy is...

&gt;Holy shit

&gt;Daisy looks like she's going to eat the menu

&gt;Alex glances at Daisy

&gt;Fear in his eye just a moment.

&gt;""Ladies

&gt;Thank you for being a bit Alpha

&gt;Worried Daisy didn't hear

&gt;Waiter shows up

It started innocent enough.  Drinks were ordered.  Alex opted for a cocktail while Alicia and I went with virgin daiquiris (I was three weeks away from 21.  Alicia was five weeks.  Daisy wouldn't be 21 until next year.) and Daisy ordered

&gt;Can't wait to be 21

&gt;This thing is still damn tasty.

&gt;""Can I get anyone some appetizers?""

&gt;Wind picks up

&gt;Oh shit

&gt;""OH YES I WANT THIS AND THIS AND THAT!""

&gt;blank stare

&gt;Alex says nothing

&gt;""Um

Alicia and I both let our guilt wash away and ordered combo plates with different types.  It was like $40 and Alex didn't bat an eye.  He ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and scallops, kicked the tension up.  You see, this place was running a 3-course special that had a soup, choice of entree, and dessert.

&gt;Daisy looks possessed

&gt;At least she found something she liked

&gt;""CAN I LIKE GET TWO OF THESE?""

&gt;Waiter looks confused.

&gt;Alex looks worried.

&gt;""Ma'am

&gt;Bellowing in 3

&gt;""I'M A FULL FIGURED WOMAN WITH A THYROID CUNDISHUN! I NEED MORE THAN JUST THAT""

&gt;Look at menu

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;Each 3-course is $40

&gt;Alex cringes

The waiter looks at Alex, small talk was absolutely nil.  Alex kicked up his drinking a bit and finished his first cocktail before appetizers even came.  Once those came, we realized that Daisy had no intention of sharing.  Alex showed his first sign of his incredibly long patience running thin.

&gt;""Daisy...appetizers are meant for all of us.""

&gt;LOLFATLOGIC

&gt;Silly Alex

&gt;""I NEED ALL OF THESE TO TIDE ME OVER!  DON'T YOU TAKE ANY OF THEM!""

&gt;Holy shit

&gt;Can see Alex's fist clench up by his leg

&gt;Reach over and pat on thigh

&gt;Alex calms down

&gt;Please don't snap

&gt;Death glare to Daisy as she destroys appetizers

Alicia chimes in with small talk about our classes to break the tension, but he recovered and enjoyed the conversation.  Daisy, meanwhile, destroys the appetizers and then starts in on her two first courses, which are both clam chowder.  The rest of us are enjoying some salad, which gets a look of disdain from our hamplanet, telling us ""SALAD IS SO BAD FOR YOU!""  Whatever.  Michelle swings by to see how things are going and looks absolutely horrified by Daisy's assault on the food.  Alex looks at her as if he is trying to tell her they can talk later and she seems to get the idea

&gt;""SHE IS SUCH A SCRAWNY GIRL

&gt;Oh no.

&gt;Bitch

&gt;Alex looks calm.

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;Daisy bellows

&gt;Cocktail sauce comes out of her mouth

&gt;fuckinggross.mp3

&gt;""WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M ALL THE WOMAN YOU NEED!""

&gt;She doesn't get it

Alex let it go, as Alex said it would be.  You know how they say when there is good food, no one says a word?  It's true.  Daisy, however, made a complete fool out of the entire table with her next request.  You see, her entrees were basically two full lobsters, which is more than enough for one person.  They brought out the normal size little sides of butter.

&gt;Food looks incredible

&gt;Can't wait to dig in.

&gt;Hear bellowing building up

&gt;""I NEED MORE BUTTER!""

&gt;You have two cups...

&gt;Waiter already looks pained

&gt;""Well

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;FATLOGIC KICKS IN

&gt;""I NEED MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP MY FIGURE!  BRING ME A BOWL OF IT!""

&gt;........a bowl?

&gt;A bowl of butter?

&gt;""Ma'am....are you sure?""

&gt;""YES I'M SURE NOW LIKE GET BACK THERE AND GET IT!""

I have never been more embarrassed in my life.  Sure enough

&gt;""TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH!  MY LOBSTER IS GETTING COLD!""

&gt;Bitch you are impossible

&gt;greedybitch.com

The rest of dinner went pretty well

$235 for the whole thing.  Daisy's share of it was half.  He said nothing and put his credit card.  He tipped the waiter $50 for the trouble he had to deal with.  Daisy saw the tip as we were getting up to leave.

&gt;""HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT MUCH!  HE WAS A TERRIBLE WAITER!""

&gt;Alex

&gt;isn't worth arguing.

&gt;nope.

&gt;""He had to deal with a lot

&gt;MOAR BELLOWING!

&gt;""OH MY GOD NO HE DIDN'T ALEX YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TIP PROPERLY!""

&gt;sigh...

Alex hugged Michelle goodbye and said goodbye to Alicia and I.  Daisy was already out the door and headed for the car.  We apologized to Michelle

The ride home was pretty silent, Daisy went straight into the small freezer and started heating up food!  It blew all of us away!  Alex went into the living room after grabbing a glass of whiskey and sat down to watch TV.  Alicia and I joined him while Daisy went into her bedroom with another TV dinner.

&gt;""Girls...I hope you enjoyed things tonight.""

&gt;Poor guy looks defeated

&gt;Daisy ruined things

&gt;fatbitchlogic.com

&gt;""We did

&gt;Alicia trying to make him feel good

&gt;""Not your fault we have an inconsiderate person with us.""

&gt;Alex nodded and sipped before turning on the TV.

&gt;""Alright

Alicia and I squealed like stupid little school girls.  The three of us dove straight into that shit and had a blast that night.  We knew we had at least made one awesome choice with a roommate

**TL;DR:  Awesome roomie takes everyone out to dinner.  Fat bitch shows no politeness and runs up bill

&gt;old man wins race.  sits down on scooter.  the fun begins.

&gt;at this point I'm just standing their laughing.  I've never felt less empathy towards another living creature.  The only thing I cared about now was how utterly embarrassed this breathing dresser drawer could get.

Before we start, but never too bad. Also, the marines have a stricter weight policy than other branches, so I'm not used to seeing people using two-man military tents as fatigues. 



Be me, and had an omelette made for me (Ham, turkey, and some veggies).

I turn around and see quite possibly the biggest army soldier I've ever seen. This guy must have enlisted as a tank, to eat in peace. 


Apparently even a few veggies are too much for Tank, he picks the table right next to mine and sits down. Whatever, constantly pulling my plate out of his orbit will give me a workout while I eat.. Think rowing machine. 


As I finished my meal


&gt;""Hey Sgt



I try to stay out of the inter-branch arguments over who's better


&gt;Tank: You shouldn't be supporting a branch that forces eating disorders on it's people


Me: I'm sorry?


&gt;Tank: The marines force you all to look so thin, where we can be healthy.


At this point. I realize that I've finally entered an FPS


Me, the better chance you have when you have to run for a mile in 100lbs of gear. 


&gt;Tank: I tried to join the marines


At this point a couple sailors from another table were looking at us. 


Me: soldier, not mine. I personally wouldn't want you anywhere near my squad, and if you want to stay your ""healthy weight"", then by all means, join a branch that allows it. Just remember, you're a much, MUCH larger target than I am, you would have to rely on me to carry/drag you to safety. Get over your entitlement mentality and grow up. You're in the military. Your job is to protect people


As I turned away and walked away from him, I need to prep my marines for our yearly physical fitness test.

&gt;wait.wut

&gt;weird '90s karaoke set up hanging out up at the back of the room

&gt;this is bad on it's own

&gt;not looking forward to awarding ""drunkest performance of Eye of the Tiger"" achievement badge tonight

&gt;her mouth makes sounds I didn't really know existed

&gt;wants attention

&gt;sixty-something accountant looks like someone just murdered his family

&gt;Dire Weight is really giving this her all

&gt;wonder if she will combust into a puddle of grease and ketchup

&gt;even SideDish looks apprehensive about this turn of events

&gt;looks like her valiant efforts to appease the volcano of flesh have backfired

&gt;now we are all doomed to burn in the ashes of Mt. Fleshsuvius

&gt;the discordant wails wear off

&gt;aims herself and throws entire planet mass into the chair

&gt;we all know what is coming next before it happens

&gt;the initial crack is followed by ungodly thump

&gt;it's finally happened

&gt;ZZ Top the Scales is sitting on the floor

&gt;two realizations hit her fat skull at once:

&gt;1)she has precisely one friend here atm

&gt;any people who tolerated her before are now angry because of the cupcake incident

&gt;2)she can not get up alone

&gt;thoughts passing through her chocolate covered brain are clearly a rarity

&gt;begins weeping

&gt;calls out to Jan to help her get up

&gt;Jan is obviously torn

&gt;too polite to outright refuse

&gt;simply stares back at her in bewilderment

&gt;Stuck in The Doors starts thrashing from side to side

&gt;[mfw]( http://i.imgur.com/ugoKd.gif) she lets out a howl of pure rage and SideDish is immediately at her side

&gt;everyone is mesmerized by the orca whales' majestic dance

&gt;eventually Hamthrax makes it back onto her feet

&gt;her knees weep deeply

&gt;me and Jan just recovering from our rib cracking laughter

&gt;tears stain my face

&gt;Streetlight Meaty-fisto locks onto us

&gt;barrels at us like we're an open buffet

&gt;[ofw]( http://i.imgur.com/iR6ajJm.jpg) there are still pieces of wood stuck to those majestic thighs

&gt;before we can react there are two sweaty hams on my chest and I'm stumbling backwards

&gt;one of the office bros grabs me before i crash into wall

&gt;see Jan launch at Paul McCartney &amp; the Bingo Wings and shove her back

&gt;her pudgy face looks almost human in it's shock

&gt;""SHE MADE ME FALL""

&gt;[mfw](http://i.imgur.com/YwOuVCB.gif)

&gt;people look at her in utter disbelief

&gt;""YOU BROKE THE GODDAMN CHAIR"" Jan is now furious

&gt;erupts ""SHE WAS LAUGHING AT ME""

&gt;oh wait

&gt;another office bro grabs his arm

&gt;part of me wants him to hit her

&gt;we leave

&gt;next Monday

&gt;am apologized to for the push

&gt;at first sarcastically

&gt;like a first grader after breaking a window

&gt;dearly wish I could have seen More than a few Chainz's face

&gt;Jan says it was amazing and sweaty

&gt;[mfw]( http://i.imgur.com/Uwol0VN.gif) Jan has to apologize to 30 Secs to Mars Bar after she wails about being discriminated for her size and how being ""a few pounds heavier"" makes her a target

&gt;*a few pounds heavier*

&gt;can hear Jan seething out an ""I'm sorry""

&gt;Rihamma vomits out ""I know you didn't mean it

&gt;am both disgusted by her delusion and worried about the pet name (might try to spread him on a doughnut and eat him)

&gt;SuperFatTramp continues about how being with certain people makes us act differently

&gt;realize she blames me for this 100%

&gt;take a deep breath 

&gt;""maybe you should start dating a McDonald's dumpster""

""She sez you got ova-spray on eeet""  (If you want to hear BSB's accent, especially when he is angry).  
  
At this point, that's why I have insurance.  As soon as he said ""water buffalo"" I knew who he was referring too - water buffalo are notorious for their ill tempers, poor eyesight and quick rage.  
  
I told him the story, I thought that was it.  
  
Two weeks later, formally demanded compensation in the amount of $24,990 plus legal fees on behalf of their client.  $6000 of this was direct costs relating to a bare metal re-spray of a black (and arctic white) mini cooper and the remainder was compensation for pain &amp; suffering, insult to dignity and infliction of duress due to physical threats.

Alpha as fuck, I'll lawyer up then counter-sue. What a waste of time though...  
  
I mentioned to BSB that she had in fact sued me.  He just laughed.  
Two days later
Throw it on the laptop, or maybe it was just because she was standing next to a Mini.  
  
The boy scout thing to do would be to copy this DVD and courier one to D. Beetus &amp; Partners so they could skip the settlement conference and just write up the final bill for their client.  
  
But, there are no elevators.  Court rooms and info desk etc etc are on the main floor to accomodate disabled people..  The real question is, did the plaintiff's lawyer consider his client's condishun and request a disabled access conference room on the first floor?  
Not according to the notice I was served.  See you Room 304
  
Settlement hearing day arrives.  My Bentley is back from BSBs shop and looking sharp.  Today the old leather and wool smell like justice.  I am optimistic and wearing my favourite three button suit
Also slender is my leather binder.  It contains naught but three things - a DVD
  
I run up the three flights of stairs to room 304.  It is empty.  At 10am
We sit down and wait.  5 minutes.  10 minutes.  At 15 minutes the adjudicator anounces that the hearing will begin at 10:20 regardless of attendance.  
At 10:20 the door is thrown open.  The water buffalo and her lawyer enter.  
  
Does the plaintiff wish to go first?  Yes, delicious, insulin rich justice is about to be served, so she proceeds.  
I'm not going to recount her version of the events because honestly, but I do remember practicing breathing techniques to calm myself in the face of her rambling, incoherent but mostly inaccurate account.  
  
Her lawyer cut her off after about 20 minutes, volunteered that we were all tired, it was a hot day, and let's do what we can to avoid court, okay?  For $15,000 we can settle this and go home.  
  
Does he want to hear my counter offer?  Of course he does!  The Water Buffalo perks up out her stupor - climbing stairs, she is refreshed.  
  
Ah, then I'll get back to the counter offer.  I pull out the DVD.  Brows furrow, jimmies begin rustling in concerned anticipation.  What is this?  Why was it not mentioned?  How could this man allow me to dream of muh settlement when he has a trick up his sleeve?  Curse those devious thin people....  
  
Right there
I turn it off
 
The adjudicator turns to the now deflated bean bag chair
""Ma'am
""yes""
""Is that you in the video?""
""yes""
Turns to me - ""Can I see a copy of your traffic control permit?""
The adjudicator reads it several times
  
The adjudicator speaks.

Hello my BBWs

&gt;So after a good month of having our lunches interrupted by the seismograph wobbling Hamthrax

&gt;figured any place near a salad bar would good.

&gt;decide on a park

&gt;is also on a hill

&gt;first day

&gt;Alice in Fast Food Chains doesn't spot us

&gt;shocking lack of Beached Whale Boys for a week

&gt;Monday rolls around like Whitecake fighting her sleep apnea 

&gt;in the park

&gt;feel disturbance in the gravitational force

&gt;birds leave nearby trees

&gt;somewhere a mountain goat brays warning

&gt;either Odin is coming down to smite the unworthy or we're about to have our romantic spot nuked in spam. 

&gt;Sure enough

&gt;a fog of Cheeto dust rolls in

&gt;the voices comes from the orange mist that so thick it usually only inhabits jersey shore.

&gt;JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN

&gt;eat in silence though

&gt;poor man has had his fill of Hamthrax

&gt;holds eye contact as Iron Mayo swallows an entire sandwich

&gt;man has the strength of 1000 suns (similar to Hamthrax's BMI)

&gt;still pronounces his name like a drooling American trashbin

&gt;Red Hot Pockets is now bubbling over with rage staring at me

&gt;mascara starts to run down her mayo streaked face

&gt;direct sunlight *is* the best disinfectant

&gt;take this time to calmly stand up and throw away the rest of my food

&gt;think bf will follow

&gt;bits of snack food encircle her middle in a graceful dance of gravitational attraction

&gt;look back to see bf paler than Red Velvet Cheesecake Revolver's pillow arms

&gt;suggest we head back

&gt;Hamthrax is not finished with her lunch

&gt;Is faced with the ulitimate Fat Logic dilema:

&gt;Eat food

&gt;we see the chocolate covered gears churning under her shaggy

&gt;makes the only decision a Hambeast can

There was a hamplanet girl sitting at the next table by herself. I only noticed this because she seemed to order exactly the same thing as my table did. Fried cheesesticks for an appetizer to share, and beers all around. (We all go there every Friday and order the exact same thing.) Also because Fatgirl was pointedly staring at our table the entire time, and making all of us uncomfortable. 

Drunk boyfriend texts me a dare to finish my food before HamGirl does. I feebly attempt this incredible feat, pays, and goes to stand awkwardly by the door. About five minutes later, a Hammy couple comes in, and they all exchange hugs and greetings.

Hamgirl walks with them back to the table that she had just left, roommate and I just kind of exchange looks of confusion that quickly turn into giggles when Hamgirl orders, once again, cheesesticks, a steak, potatoes, and beer. 

The Hamily spends the next half hour discussing how Hamgirl is starving herself because her bulimic roommate eats all her food, but Hamgirl says that she's in college now and none of the people in her dorms would let her forget it if she needed her dad to solve her problems. HamParents eventually decide to just double Hamgirls allowance for food, so she can eat out instead of buying groceries.

MFW the college they're talking about is a local community college that doesn't offer housing of any kind.

**TL;DR** HamGirl buys herself large dinner, announces to entire world that she hasn't eaten all day while eating her second dinner. Glares scarily at my friends and I, presumably for being able to fit in a booth. Makes up story about her dorm that doesn't exist to get more food money from parents.",,False,self,t5_2vzax,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jp032/incredibly_short_fps/

I moved out of the house when I was 16 and in with my very good friend and her family. 
Her dad was a truck driver and was gone for a week or so at a time and was only home for a day or two in between. 
She had an 8 year old little brother who would get super bored during the day and didn't really have a male role model while his dad was gone


We played airsoft, and a bunch of other games with each other and his friends when I wasn't working or hanging out with my friends. 
This kid LOVED the military almost to the point where it was creepy. 
I had extra cash at the time so I figured
I didn't have a car at the time so I asked his sister to take us and she agreed




I suppose this is where I should describe her friend.
She was 17 years old
To give you an idea of her proportions she had actually insisted on driving after we picked her up because she didn't want to sit in the back seat




&gt;Dem curves.





We get to the surplus store and she immediately starts complaining about being there. 
I always thought they were cool - gas masks, WWII-era uniforms, targets, novelty stuff like hand grenade paperweights, etc.
The kid and I go upstairs and find the MRE's (pre-made complete meals in sealed pouches that can be heated up). These usually have an insanely high calorie count since they're made for people in the military/survival situations.
The best part? They were on sale. I think it was something like 2 for $5.00 which was a bargain since they're usually $4.00/each depending on the type. I think we got like 12 of them - mostly the lunch/dinner ones but a few breakfast types. Omelets, etc.





The hamplanet is bitching still



We get back to the house and show his mom our spoils of war - leaving the MRE's out in the car with the hamplanet since we were going to go to the store after dropping the kid off.





My friend gets a text from hamplanet saying, she'll be back with the stuff so we can look through it and plan out meals for our ""missions"".




I'm sure some of you already know what happened. The bitch ate **SEVEN** of the MRE's in the time span of ~30 minutes. **THIRTY FUCKING MINUTES**. Each one of them has ~1, and feasted on them.





We didn't even notice them missing when she got back since she put the wrappers back in the bag on the bottom. When we *did* notice and called her out on it she didn't even try defending herself or even apologizing. She just stared.

* * *



**TL;DR;**: hamplanet has bad attitude, and eats half of them. Doesn't apologize when called out, just stares.",,False,self,t5_2vzax,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1iymy1/hamplanet_eats_7000_calories_in_stolen_mres/

I was able to eat an entire large pizza, I'd get a crunch wrap supreme combo with double the meat, two volcano burritos, and the largest soda that they could offer.

I started to feel like utter shit all of the time


In October

Weight started to fall off and I decided I'd keep with it for a while and see how far I could get with my recent lifestyle changes. When I saw that I was actually making progress

Now

I feel certain that I will never be fat again. I no longer crave shitty food

Here is a picture of my weight loss along the way: http://imgur.com/hNu3ZwO

&gt;Be me, and I have nothing to do, so I decide to head down to my apartment complex's pool, as it is a lovely, hot day and I'm hoping to soak up some summer sun. Put on my bikini and head out! 


&gt;Stake out a seat, and proceed to zone out. Ahh, relaxation. 


&gt;Been relaxing for approx. half an hour when suddenly


&gt;Sky goes black; has the sun disappeared behind a lunar eclipse? 


&gt;No


&gt;Momma Ham is a bit taller than me, maybe 200. 


&gt;Although there are many lounge chairs available, out of polite acknowledgement. Momma Ham side-eyes me and grunts. Notice tween Ham whisper something to Momma.


&gt;whatever.jpeg


&gt;Moments later, ""Excuse me, Miss?"" 


&gt;Hmm. Can't be talking to me. I'm just gonna ignore that...


&gt;""Excuse me?!?"" 


&gt;Please


&gt;""Hello! Excuse muhh!"" 


&gt;Take my headphones out and sit up. It's Momma Ham


&gt;""Uh


&gt;Momma Ham: ""I would appreciate if you would cover yourself up. The way you're dressed is not appropriate."" 


&gt;Quickly glance down, rather confused. 


&gt;Me:""Sorry, just like everyone else here..."" 


Here I'll add, but tween Ham was wearing a comparable bikini to mine. In fact, I would argue that hers was more ""revealing"" than mine, being that her boobs were spilling out of her top, and I have none to speak of.


&gt;Momma Ham: ""Ain't no one else here wearing a bikini like that! You skinny girls, it ain't right!"" 


&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, why are you asking me to cover up and not them?"" 


&gt;Momma Ham sighs indignantly. ""You're hurting my daughter's feelings! Because she has to sit here and look at *you*


&gt;Tween ham starts giggling. Clearly, will ya?"" *chugs a can of Sprite* 


&gt;I'm not too confrontational, ""You know, it's not very nice to call me a skinny twig. What if I told you I actually had an illness that makes me this small?"" Which I do, chronic migraines, and the medication I take to prevent them doesn't help. 


&gt;Tween ham pipes up


&gt;At this point


&gt;Me: ""Look, why don't you go sit over there?"" 


Note that I didn't feel I should have to move, and they were the ones causing a scene. At this point, several other people who were near us were glancing over to discern what was occurring.


&gt;Momma Ham gets up to bitch to the pool monitor. Pool monitor is not a lifeguard. He's just a guy who sits at the pool all day to make sure that everyone who comes in is actually an apartment resident


&gt;I hear her all the way across the pool deck, and how I'm hurting her daughter's precious feelings (by existing?). I worry for second; Pool monitor is a big guy himself. But it appears her fat logic isn't working on him! They both walk over to where our chairs are located (Momma Ham huffing and puffing the whole way.)


&gt;Pool Monitor


&gt;Me: ""Yes sir."" 


&gt;Pool Monitor: ""I thought so."" He directs his attention back to Momma Ham: ""Look, doing nothing wrong. She gave you the option to move, and you refused, so I'm going to ask you to leave for the day."" 


&gt;Momma Ham is furious. Starts blathering about ""You can't kick me outta here! I pay my rent just like her! She's the one causing a disturbance! You just took her side cuz she's skinny! Imma take this up with management

Go read [part one](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gvcyh/hamplanet_roomie_the_nightmare_waddles/)

You back? Let's rock. 

So. I've suddenly become the nastiest roomie ever. Now do you recall in the last story when I said I trotted off to the leasing office? 

I went there to explain this situation, ""Look. Either you give me my own place and I promptly pay rent, or you leave me there, and I can't anymore. I need to eat, and I cannot possibly continue like this."" They said, ""Okay, your credit rating's okay, which I devoured on the spot. Fuck toasting it. I was *that* hungry. I probably looked like a ravening wolf. 

Walked out of there with a new lease; they let me out of the one with Flabby and set me up with a new place

Flabby had no idea, the kitchen stuff; *everything* else I owned had been stuffed into my room when she moved in. Rather crowded, I have a lot of books). 

You're supposed to give notice when you bail on a roomie, and the food I bought that I never saw again because she fucking ate it. Oh, and now and then she'd splort out of her lair and demand to go with me on my dinner date because she's hungry and I'm selfish and how can I leave her to just starve. I was exquisitely polite, which might have tipped off someone that wasn't so food-centered, because god knows I was not shy for the last few weeks before I got the new lease. Nope. Then it was nonstop yelling at her from the time I got home till the time I went to bed and nonstop death metal at max volume behind a locked door when I was at work. This chick redefined oblivious. I'm terrible at this shit, even I would've twigged. Her? Nope. Just ""I wanna go too, I'm hungryyyyyy!"" Cry me a river. I kept up the deathmetal thing

Stuck out the final two weeks. Got home the night before my move, Flabby? Which you never have? 

Now-husband came over and we packed all my shit up and then went to new place with my mattress and couch. Stuck in a flea bomb and ran like hell. Wonderful thing! I washed down all the exposed areas the next day. Nobody got sick

I was free. And someone did gift me with a secondhand set of pots and pans; mine were a total loss thanks to Flabby. I just left them there. 

Flea-bathed the cats the night before MoveOut. They did not enjoy this. Cats have about 157 ways of letting you know they're unhappy. Ow. Packed the cats over to his place

Next morning. Already hot as Satan's asshole, she never comes home for three days when she knows I'm gonna ream her out for bill money. Excellent. 2 of my then-current 3 boyfriends turned up; the last one had to work. 

More friends turned up, across the complex and out of that shithole. Now-husband went and fetched my kittens when we were done, and I ordered pizza and beer for everyone. AS YOU SHOULD. People bust their asses for you, it's on you to reward them properly. We had a grand evening. Net wasn't on yet, and I didn't even bother with cable, so we just shot the shit and got tanked. 

The shitfest from old apartment was amazing. The people in the complex office loved me, that he has never in his life seen such filth. He refused to go in. Think about that. A maintenance guy refused to step foot in her place.

Little while later

Run back upstairs. Inform Bitch Squad. They gleefully investigate. Run back down and jog to work.

Get home and.... 

Turns out

..... oh my. Shall I do this? Very evil. Surely

No, and now you've got this one precious unbelievable chance to fuck her back. 

Yep. It was pure revenge.

Welp. Hour later

I tell you all

Won't surprise you to know that she was online later that week whining about oppression and being picked on and police brutality (total bullshit, trying to use her weight, and they just kept marching her into the car). 

Then the apartment complex finally got their eviction cleared and BOOM goes the dynamite. We had a little party at my place, can't imagine why. 

Now I hope that's enough for all of your jimmies to come to rest. I am not a fan of beating the fuck out of someone

TL;DR: Lardass fatlogical roomie fucked me over; got her a police record and evicted.

&gt; Chilling in the Yacht Club with my coworkers

&gt; Working on some equipment and eating burrito

&gt; Feelin' good

&gt; Excited for the day and meeting all the new kids

&gt; Parents and children start filing in

&gt; Do some meeting and greeting

&gt; They're all super nice and polite

&gt; Look at student check in list

&gt; Looks like a kid named Mike never showed up

&gt; Class starts in 2 minutes

&gt; Decide to get on with it

&gt; Parents all leave after we announce class is starting

&gt; My boss notices Mike didn't show up

&gt; Says if he doesn't show up in 10 minutes we should call

&gt; Eh whatever

&gt; Continue noshing on delicious burrito

&gt; Wrangle students into the main class area

&gt; Start playing some name learning games

&gt; Students all adorable and well behaved

&gt; Be lulled into false sense of security

&gt; Suddenly deafening noise

&gt; Front door has been slammed open

&gt; OPEN

&gt; So unnecessary

&gt; Boss tells coworker to go check who it is

&gt; Coworker disappears behind double doors

&gt; Hear angry discussion

&gt; Burrito now forgotten

&gt; Boss signals for me to go check it out

&gt; Head for the double doors that lead to mudroom

&gt; Hear wailing

&gt; Look at boss

&gt; He gives the JUST GO look

&gt; Scramble out double doors

&gt; Behold

&gt; A wall appears to be blocking me from going any further

&gt; Oh wait

&gt; It's a woman

&gt; Massive greasemonster lumbers around to look at me

&gt; Probably about 5'10"" and upwards of 350 lbs

&gt; Piggy eyes lock on mine

&gt; Disgusting

&gt; Greasy hair cut and styled to resemble roadkill

&gt; And then

&gt; OH GOD WHAT

&gt; HER SPAWN

&gt; 5' and more than 200 lbs

&gt; Pray to god it's not a student

&gt; God smacks down my fervent wish like a fattie smacking away salad

&gt; So this is Mike

&gt; Wondering to self how the hell this is gonna work

&gt; Apparently coworker was politely trying to tell greasemonster that we have weight guidelines

&gt; Gotta fit these kids in drysuits

&gt; Water here will kill you fast

&gt; Greasemonster will have none of it

&gt; Tells us we're discriminating and that's illegal

&gt; Coworker and I are at a loss

&gt; We have no power here

&gt; Greasemonster proceeds to leave spawn with us

&gt; Just drives away

&gt; Well

&gt; Coworker and I exchange looks

&gt; Mike has been silent the whole time

&gt; He knows this is not a place for him

&gt; Take him into main classroom

&gt; Boss has some ropes and chairs set up for tutorials

&gt; Been waiting for us to get back

&gt; Sees Mike

&gt; Gives coworker and I a look of horror

&gt; Take a deep breath

&gt; Accept fate

&gt; Mike stays quiet all through the tutorials

&gt; Once again lulled into false sense of security

&gt; Time to fit kids with drysuits

&gt; Coworker and I scope out kids and then grab them suits

&gt; Suits come in XS, and L. XS for a really small kid, S usually fits our students, M for older kids in advanced classes and for small/medium adults, L for big guys

&gt; Get a bunch of S's

&gt; What the hell do we grab Mike

&gt; Eventually grab a M and L just in case

&gt; Go back to the classroom

&gt; Kids start putting on drysuits

&gt; Hand Mike the M

&gt; All hell breaks loose

&gt; WHY IS MY SUIT BIGGER

&gt; ARE YOU SAYING I'M FAT

&gt; WHY CAN'T I WEAR A SMALL

&gt; nopenopenope

&gt; Boss tries to console him

&gt; Says it's the right size

&gt; Says Mike should try it before he tries a small

&gt; Coworker and I exchange looks

&gt; Mike throws a huge fit

&gt; All the other kids have their suits on

&gt; Boss decides to take them down to the docks

&gt; Leaves coworker and I with Mike

&gt; Dammit

&gt; Mike can barely fit one corpulent leg into the M drysuit

&gt; Shoves fat foot through ankle seal

&gt; Gets foot stuck halfway through

&gt; Seal breaks

&gt; Gonna have to fix that later

&gt; Grab size L

&gt; Tell him to try it

&gt; Mike loses his shit completely

&gt; Runs around classroom

&gt; Still has the M suit stuck on his foot

&gt; Completely destroys perfectly good drysuit

&gt; Lies down on linoleum floor

&gt; Starts crying

&gt; Coworker and I are dumbstruck

&gt; What

&gt; Try to make him get up

&gt; Cries more and struggles weakly on the floor

&gt; Calls us evil bitches

&gt; Must. Stifle. Laughter.

&gt; Consider whaling on him with the oars in the back room

&gt; Decide not to

&gt; Instantly regret decision when he gets up and tackles me

&gt; WHAT THE FUCK

&gt; NOPE

&gt; Throw Mike off me

&gt; FUCK THAT

&gt; Throw L suit at him

&gt; Tell him to put it on or else

&gt; He puts it on

&gt; Barely fits

&gt; It's way to tall and narrow

&gt; Oh fucking well

&gt; Chuck a life jacket at him

&gt; Lets get shit moving

&gt; Herd Mike towards the door

&gt; He remains silent

&gt; Tell him to grab a piece of equipment to bring down to the dock

&gt; Give him a bag of sails

&gt; Super light

&gt; Mike looks at it like it's a bundle of veggies

&gt; ""I'm not carrying that""

&gt; Coworker has had enough of his shit

&gt; Chucks the bag at him

&gt; Says if he doesn't take it we're calling his mom

&gt; See fear in his eyes

&gt; He picks up the bag

&gt; Finally get to the dock after waiting for Mike to waddle down

&gt; He doesn't stop complaining once the whole way

&gt; MY FEET HURT

&gt; I'M TIRED

&gt; THIS IS TOO FAR

&gt; Dock is 40 feet from the Yacht club

&gt; Coworker is livid

&gt; I'm about ready to murder Mike

&gt; Aaaaaaand apparently everyone has left

&gt; Check the time

&gt; We're 2 hours behind them

&gt; Put Mike in the instructor skiff

&gt; Coworker winces when Mike gets in and it tips heavily to his side

&gt; Notice boat is almost out of gas

&gt; Fucking fantastic

&gt; End up dropping Mike off in boss's boat to make a fuel run

&gt; Come back and find out boss put Mike in one of the other kid's boats

&gt; Sweet release

&gt; A full hour of Mike-free relaxing on the safety skiff

&gt; Lunch time!

&gt; No wind so we tow all the sail boats back to the dock

&gt; Get all the students into the classroom

&gt; Everyone unpacks their lunches

&gt; Fucking Mike brought enough to feed a small family

&gt; Has fucking pizza in his backpack

&gt; A whole fucking pizza

&gt; FOR LUNCH

&gt; Proceeds to mow down the whole thing in under 10 minutes

&gt; I don't even

&gt; Apparently Mike is still hungry

&gt; HOW

&gt; Starts scoping out the other kids lunches

&gt; Locks on a target

&gt; Tiny girl

&gt; Has a brownie

&gt; Mike lumbers over

&gt; GIMME THAT

&gt; Swipes brownie

&gt; Sweet jesus

&gt; Coworker and I confront him

&gt; Immediately starts crying

&gt; Says we're picking on him for being different

&gt; Says it's not fair

&gt; Says it's not his fault he was still hungry

&gt; Must suppress rage

&gt; Tell him to apologize

&gt; Starts crying more

&gt; Boss looks on helplessly

&gt; Nothing he can do

&gt; We decide to let it slide

&gt; Nothing we can do either

&gt; Then he says he needs help out of his drysuit

&gt; Ask why

&gt; Says he has to go to the bathroom

&gt; Fair enough

&gt; Help him out

&gt; He has deep rings around his neck

&gt; Show him the bathroom

&gt; Go back to classroom

&gt; Moments after closing double doors

&gt; Rush back to bathroom

&gt; You okay in there buddy?

&gt; Hear crying

&gt; Check doorknob

&gt; It's locked

&gt; Ask again what's wrong

&gt; Even more crying

&gt; Other kids are suiting up to go out again

&gt; Start banging on door

&gt; Shit is something seriously wrong

&gt; Finally crying stops and I hear Mike whimper something

&gt; What's that? I couldn't hear you

&gt; He needs help wiping

&gt; NOPENOPENOPE

&gt; Tell boss

&gt; Boss immediately calls the contact number for Mike's mom

&gt; No answer

&gt; Tries again

&gt; Still no answer

&gt; Mike still locked in bathroom

&gt; Starting to smell something rancid from under the door

&gt; Boss says to stay with Mike and keep calling his mom

&gt; I hit redial until she picks up

&gt; WURT DUR YEH WANT

&gt; Excuse me ma'm

&gt; ERHM BUSY

&gt; He's having trouble wiping himself

&gt; YER MEAN YER AFRED OF A LITTLE MESS? WERT KIRND OF SAILING INSTRUCTAH ARE YER

&gt; Hangs up

&gt; Mike still in the bathroom

&gt; How could this get any worse

&gt; At least he's getting picked up

&gt; OH WAIT

&gt; NOPE

&gt; Greasemonster doesn't show up for another 2 fucking hours

&gt; Mike is still in the bathroom

&gt; Everything is starting to smell like ass

&gt; Finally the mother arrives

&gt; Tells Mike to open the door

&gt; More crying

&gt; He won't

&gt; She starts shrieking at him

&gt; Eventually he opens the door

&gt; THAT SMELL

&gt; IT HAUNTS ME STILL

&gt; DIDN'T FLUSH

&gt; DIDN'T PULL UP PANTS

&gt; THERE WAS SHIT ON THE TOILET SEAT

&gt; Almost just left right then

&gt; I'M OUT BITCHES

&gt; But nope

&gt; Help greasemonster get Mike out of the bathroom and into her car

&gt; It's full of wrappers and pizza boxes

&gt; Finally Mike stops crying

&gt; STARTS FUCKING EATING LEFTOVER FOOD IN THE CAR

&gt; I look at greasemonster

&gt; No words

&gt; HUR HE WERS PROBABLY JURST HUNGREY

&gt; No. Fucking. WORDS.

&gt; Tell her to please not bring him back to class

&gt; This was the wrong thing to do

&gt; Greasemonster proceeds to bitch me out for discrimination

&gt; Says her son shouldn't be around negative people like me

&gt; Says my coworkers and I are assholes

&gt; Says it's not his fault he's ""big boned like his mama""

Guys... seriously guys! IT'S THE END!

**SATURDAY**

So Miranda and I were hanging out, you know because I thought it sounded so stupid. But Mirandas face lights up and says ""I thought you'd never ask!"" and kisses me. After she asks ""We should do something now!"" I in my smoothness say ""Like what? It's kinda late"" After thinking for a few moments she jumps up and suggests skinny dipping in the woodland lake nearby and before I get a chance to say anything she is dragging me along with her. As we walk she holds my hand and puts her head on my shoulder, I'm thinking ""this is going great!""

We fast forward to the lake

We go to a more secluded spot as there is a camping site on one side of the lake and strip, trying to reason with her. She says shes calling the police on me for being a pedo, we're both 18, retard I explain, she then says shes going to call the police because I was RAPING Miranda! I, angry get out of the water to get our clothes so we can leave before the campers gather round for a sea show. I get out of the water, she makes a comment about my size. Guys really I'm average, I swear! That was the last straw, he quickly comes down with this really embarrassed look on his face. He apologizes to me for her daughter being cray cray and to the officers for wasting their time. He then adds if that he doesn't want his daughter to go to jail so if we promise not to press the issue he would get a psychiatrists or a psychologist or whoever deals with this shit to help and move to leave us alone. Just as I'm about to agree she yells

&gt;DADDY! NO! IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME! I SWEAR! WE DON'T NEED TO MOVE AGAIN! HE DOES LOVE ME! Go ahead Ploggy! Tell him

Miranda scoffs and snuggle into me, the police takes this very seriously and calls for an ambulance to take her to the hospital. They come to take her away but the dad does not fit and he hurries home to drive to the hospital. But before he goes he swears hes going to make her take regular counseling sessions and to tell everyone near where they move again about his daughters instability.

this just happened:

Preface: I am an adult male, it's like the only hobby someone as busy as me can have. 

I like my longboard. To be honest, it's custom, gorgeous, Arbor board which, after I had the piece commissioned in 2009, I spent ages wood burning a long mural of Hobbes from the Watterson cartoon. I take this thing out like once a month because 1. it's old and 2. it's more of a work of art.

Whelp. I was doing my sunday morning ritual cruise, down the east side parkway, around the battery, and up into riverside park. For those of you that are unfamiliar, it means I go a long ass way, in some nice sunshine, and hope to be left the fuck alone long enough to recuperate from a long-ass week. 

As I was approaching the end of my run, I said sure, and went upon my way.

I'll mention that I'm shirtless, wanna fight about it?)

I get to the restaurant, but her annoying as fuck HP of a friend who, in addition to being gay, seems fucking unable to understand that some people fucking hate being touched all the time. 

Seriously, I've made it explicit that I really hat the constant touching. BUT NO, THIS FAT FUCK CANNOT KEEP THE GREASE OUT OF HIS EARS!

So When I arrive, this flabby fuck decides that now would be a great time to ""Bring it on in for a hug.""

I know what you're thinking; ""Spiffyspacemanspiff

I'l tell you: It's wrong when you have asked politely many times to not be hugged, not that it really matters, but this HP is, ostensively, a male, self confessed bi-sexual, and has said, that he'd like to fuck me. (if you're not enraged by now

So like fuckign fat ass clockwork, out of breath, and overall sick of his shit, I say: ""Dude, no. I'm tired of all the touching. I've asked you to stop and, you wont seem to take the hints, so please: Stop.""

He makes some piggly movement back, and well earned brunch.

As is the typical fashion

HP spends the meal giving me dirty looks, and pretty tired of what is basically sexual harassment. 

As we're getting the check, Naw: Ive only got enough cash for my meal. No one takes offense, but HP apparently did. 

We go outside

Whelp.

Then HP decides that his 400 pound lard ass is now fit to go for a magical whirl on my pride and joy. Despite never having ridden one in his life, and jump on my glorious steed. 

CRACK.


Mother Fucking CRACK.

anyone wanna guess what happened? Hmm? HMM????? This fucker's moon sized weigh not only broke my board once, it was such a force that the assholce actually *snapped the little plastic spindles in the wheels!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

I lost it. 

I rarely loose it

But this fat fucking lard-pile of shit was standing across the corpse of my best friend. He tried to sheepishly grin and

Guys. I want you to know I try to be a nice person. But this was inexcusable. This was dastardly. This was murder.

So I looked at his beady

The above is what I remember before I simply broke into a fife minute long barrage of the most eloquent and vicious collection of words imaginable. 

Fucker told me he'd pay to have it fixed... You cant just buy another custom. You cant replace those years.

I walked home carrying three pieces of my glorious steed from the Upper West side to brooklyn.

I'm also really sunburnt. 

I think I'm gonna cry.

&gt;&gt;I think I've seen the worst of retail  

&gt;&gt;WRONG  

&gt;&gt;in comes a woman that is clearly too large for our clothes

&gt;&gt;whatever

&gt;&gt;head over to see what she needs  

&gt;&gt;""I WANT YOUR PANTS.""  

&gt;&gt;not sure why she's angry

&gt;&gt;I show her to where we keep our yoga pants

&gt;&gt;""YOU ONLY HAVE UP TO A 12. WHERE ARE THE OTHER ONES?""  

&gt;&gt;""Sorry ma'am

&gt;&gt;mistake  

&gt;&gt;""Are you saying I'm too fat for these? I want THESE ones. I want to try them on. I'm sure I'll fit.""  

&gt;&gt;no chance in hell  

&gt;&gt;I start to mumble something about our sizes running small

At this point I just gave up and showed her to the fitting rooms, and leave. This was a *huge* mistake.  

&gt;&gt;about 20 minutes later I feel an aggressive tapping on my shoulder  

&gt;&gt;it's Hammy

&gt;&gt;the pants look sadder than the puppies in ASPCA commercials  

&gt;&gt;Hammy is upset    

&gt;&gt;""Something's wrong with these pants.""  

&gt;&gt;she holds them up. they are ripped in several places

&gt;&gt;""Did this happen while you were trying them on?""  

&gt;&gt;obviously

&gt;&gt;this makes Hammy furious  

&gt;&gt;""They came this way!!! Are you saying I ripped these? I told you I could fit.""  

&gt;&gt;I quickly get my manager

&gt;&gt;Manager explains that they were definitely not ripped before she tried them on

&gt;&gt;Hammy flips out

&gt;&gt;""YOU CAN'T STEAL MY MONEY. IT'S YOUR FAULT THESE RIPPED. YOU DIDN'T MAKE THEM WELL.""  

&gt;&gt;Manager threatens to call mall security  

&gt;&gt;Hammy reluctantly pays for the ruined pants

&gt;&gt;half an hour later a mall cop comes in

&gt;&gt;apparently Hammy filed a report saying that our manager called her a fat bitch and ""stole"" her money  

&gt;&gt;Hammy is now banned from our store  

I hope this didn't suck. I have plenty of stories about working here

In which we stock our cupboards.

My entire house had a very busy schedule. Maggie was the busiest of all. Between reblogging pictures of John Lennon, she had barely enough time to shower, piss, and sullenly pine for John. But the one thing besides cake that could get her up was a good shopping trip. For food, obviously.  Every ~~two~~ one week we would have an empty refrigerator. Most of the pantry would be gone, and absolutely the entire breadbox laid bare. Me and John did shopping, and we'd go around to Sasha and Andy's room to ask for their lists and money. Then we'd always look each other in the eye, and walk down to Maggies room to ask for her list. 

Why would we do this? On the very first grocery run, a bit of a walk. But for one girl and *one persons worth of grocery* we assumed she'd figure it out. We only took John's truck because we were hauling food for four. We laughed her off, and left to enjoy our lives. We came back to a massacred kitchen, and a sloppily dressed Maggie grinning, telling us she was ""ready to go to the store"". We started telling her we didn't need to go, but then we check the cupboards. Not a single item of food besides the brown rice we'd bought. John forced every cent out of her, BEFORE we went shopping with her. 

To avoid pointless double shopping, she announced she was going to shop with more care. 

""What does that mean

""I'm going to start reading the labels now. I'm worried I'm eating too much iron. I just

""Iron? Does carrot cake have a lot of iron?"" John ruminated, it's in the cream cheese frosting, you're right.""

Maggie didn't speak for the rest of the ride. We got to the store, but Maggie would tag along with us, complaining about the people, the air conditioning, and of course, our food choices. 

John and I hit the produce aisle first, ham with a plastic-like consistency. It was hard to understand how she could eat all of that and not rupture her colon. After she started following us around, John and I flipped over our grocery lists, and started playing Maggie Grocery Store Lingo Bingo (obviously John's idea). Every time Maggie finds a food "" ""absolutely ridiculous"", comments on the size of a customer, put a item of food in the cart that was at least 50% sugar, told us our food choice was stupid/unhealthy, we'd smile and mark it down. To give you an idea of how easy that game was

1. Skim/Reduced Fat milk

2. *Light* versions of ice

3. Whole grain, Rye or Non-White Bread

4. Tofu

5. Olive oil

6.""Diet"" drinks

7. Baby vegetables (""Do they think making them cuter will make me eat them? Goddamn big corporations messing with genetics!!!"")

There was more, cookies, and processed breads. There is one, exactly one pack of entenmann's cinnamon buns. I personally dislike them, because they taste like sponge cake frosted in glue, but Maggie LOVES them. She can eat three and call it ""a bite to eat"". Sometimes she'll eat a whole box, for a ""light dessert"". They're up on a higher shelf, looks at the kid, reaching his arms up to accept the treat he was trying to reach. Maggie looks at him for two seconds

We stare at her. ""Maggie?""

""Yeah

""I think the little dude was trying to get those.""

""Well

The little kid looks  at Maggie with eyes that could stop a mugging. I can see tears in the corners, but I want the little kid to be happier anyway. John and I glance at each other, then John steps toward the now cart-pushing Maggie.

""Hey, I grabbed the cinnamon rolls, threw them to the little kid, and told him to run like hell. He did, just as Maggie's jowls began to vibrate. I was worried for a second that her cries would alert an army of motorized planets, but no, he leapt away. Maggie called us ""animals"". For preventing the theft of dessert from a child. Okay Maggie. 

Maggie stopped to pick up at least five liters of Dr. Pepper

""I bet she looks just as big as me or you, valiant black spandex falling down from the effort of encasing her ""full body"". She tosses the magazine on the floor, and tries to leave. John stands in front of her cart, holding it and says ""pick it up"". 

""I CAN'T!""

""Then you shouldn't have thrown it

We continue on, 35 waiting for an order. She's pretty fit and toned, tall, and very attractive. John immediately zeros in, and gives me the sign, he's going in for some good old fashioned flirting. I know my role is to keep Maggie away. I ask her if she'd grab a box of matches from the aisle opposite the counter. Maggie almost agrees before she realizes she's nowhere near that amount of helpful. Instead, she shoots John a look, and sets her thighs on a course for the counter. When she got mad, looks Maggie in the eye

""HEY. HEY, Maggie was after the meats &amp; cheeses behind the glass. Oh thank go-

""BECAUSE IF YOU COULD MOVE YOUR WHORE ASS OUT OF THIS SPACE

The woman shakes her head in confusion

""THIS GUY ISN'T INTERESTED IN PAYING FOR SEX, BUH-BYE."" Maggie flips her hand up in the woman's face.

The woman turns red, sees the paper, and turns to yell at the woman, who is already gone. Maggie attempts to stop after, and then falls into a cracker display on the floor. Boxes and boxes of crackers go flying as she hits the floor with a huge THUMP. She's screaming hysterically, kicking on the floor as her leggings start slipping off her folds. Neither John or I could help her because we were in tears. Maggie was asked to pay for her things and leave, as quick as possible. The two of us finished our shopping in piece, assuming we were both winners.",t5_2vzax,True

Many moons ago, this was not because of the prestige that went along with it, but rather due to it being absolutely nothing like what I imagined it would be.   
  

  

In the third year of my bachelor’s degree in linguistics I fell upon hard times financially. Since I was jobless and had been funding myself through grants and scholarships thus far, of course boiled down to me eventually guilt-tripping a professor friend of mine to help me get an internship.

My search finally ended when I got accepted at the local job center in my university’s city. For those of you who do not know

As an intern,’ and interview them to see if they qualified for any work programs or job opportunities we currently had available.

This interview process was ultimately a series of yes/no questions and questions regarding their job history and skill (or lack thereof) in certain areas. Also on this list were questions regarding their physical abilities and disabilities (I’m sure you can see where this is going). 

Of course

**Wrong.**

I found out quickly that there was a very real and valid reason they gave the intern this job—and it wasn’t because it was the ‘simplest’ job, I was on my own.

At this point

However, ~185lbs). 

Of the literal thousands of people that I interviewed there during my 2 ½ year tenure at the center



It was a cool September day

I took my things to my ‘office, but business as usual.

After clearing a few more people through my queue, as if mesmerized by the waves of the sirens of lore, were drawn to (what I would soon find out was a) her. She was sitting with her bottom strewn across the groaning supports of 3 fold out chairs—a feat which I had never seen accomplished before this.

Now we, fat, tall, short, black, white, etc., this was different—I had never seen such a monster with my own eyes. After a few seconds

Many times, I would just laugh it off with the person and it wouldn’t matter—this time was different.

“Sorry, but honestly I’m bad with ‘modern’ names). 

“BOY YUH BEH TRIPPUN’ IT’S SHA-DYNASTY (highly different split in word order).”

I realized at this point what I had said, the rest of the room exploded in stifled laughter and hysterics.

The lumbering beast raised her mass with what can only be described as a mastery of the principles of physics

After what seemed like an eternity

“YUR DOOR SIZE AIN’T UP TUH CODE

“Well mam

Her beady eyes burned with the heat of a thousand McDonald’s deep-fryers as she spat out

“No

Instantly relief washed over what I still to this day assume was her face

Crisis averted—or so I thought. She proceeded to ram herself sideways through the doorway; I could feel the pressure in the room changing as her fat sealed a vacuum with the walls—breathing was getting harder.

Finally

Oh well—I took the seat designated for her

I politely cleared my throat and said

Beetus meltdown in T-minus 3……….2………….1

“YUH SKINNEH PEOPLE ER ALL DUH SAME! I GOT NEEDS YUH KNO

At this point

“Well

We had had so many people attempt to scam us by saying they were ‘disabled’ and then demand the easy ‘handicapped accessible’ jobs (which we had VERY few slots for) so they didn’t have to do real work that we required a signed document from a doctor verifying their ‘disability.’

Needless to say

“YUH CAN SEE MURH DISABILITY THOUGH!” she moaned

This is what I had been waiting for.

“I’m sorry, mam.”

Her face immediately contorted into an expression that I could only infer meant the two remaining neurons in her beetus addled brain were desperately attempting to find one another to create a cohesive thought. 

They failed.

“MUH SIZE AIN’T NO DISABILITY

“Well you are a real woman

“NO

At this point

“IF YUH DUN’T RECOMMEND MEH, in the true song of her people.

Finally

As I pressed the button

“DON’T YUH TURN UR BACK ON MEH

Two guards had bust in and one had tackled her before she (or I) even knew what was happening. To this day

As she fought and wriggled on the ground

As I went about tiding up the ‘office

1368030278.0,1dxtpu,I need to buy muh groceries!,None4GretchenWieners,1025,193,165,"Hello again my lovely fatties

This story is from my grocery store days, I was clearly young and very naïve to think that.

Be me, at least 300 lbs) leaning against the service counter, trying to catch her breath from the strenuous walk from her car to just inside the front of our store. Let's call her Porkcilla. When she has caught her breath, I notice she is still leaning against the counter, so I make myself visible and ask her if she needs any help.

Porkcilla: “YEAH

Me: “I'm sorry

P: “I need a cart RIGHT NOW

Me: “Ma'am

P: “I want to speak to a manager!”

I give out a low sigh and go hunt down a manager. I could have paged one, and the other was taken by a young (25-year-old) ex-army guy who had ¾ of his left leg blown off in Afghanistan and is permanently on crutches. Guess which one Porkcilla saw first. That's right, army guy (who we're going to call AG because I unfortunately can't think of a cool name for him). Now, AG is a super nice guy who has been shopping in our store for about 6 months as that is how long he has been discharged from the army. He is always in a good mood, super polite, and never gives anyone any crap even if they are rude to him. Back to the story.

Manager (M for short) gets up front and asks Porkcilla what he can do for her. She states what has already been stated

M: “Ma'am

P: “But I have bad knees! I need to sit down while I shop acuz it's hard for me walk through such a big store!”

AG, “Ma'am, I am almost done, you can have this cart once I get my groceries to the car.”

Porkcilla flips out when she sees that a young person is using her precious precious shopping scooter. She goes on and on about how he doesn't need it, etc. AG just sits there ringing up the rest of his groceries and looking amused while this bitch is calling him all sorts of names and cursing at him. After AG is done paying for his food, he drives the cart over to an old man that just walked into the store (who is hunched over and using a cane), gets up, and lets the old man on the cart. Porkcilla has been rendered speechless by the sight of AG having only one leg and using crutches to walk. AG goes back to grab his bags, but I stop him and tell him I will take the bags for him. I am loading his bags up on my arms when we hear a loud “Go away you fat cunt!”

We turn and see Porkcilla trying to get on the cart with the old man STILL SITTING ON IT. He's using his cane to keep her from completely squishing him. Porkcilla is very red in the face and says “I need to do my shopping!”

The old man says “Then start walking! Lord knows you could use the exercise.”

What happened next is really, this is even worse. I had to check the cameras the next day to make sure this actually happened. Hell, I watched the tape ten times to make sure it wasn't a dream. Porkcilla took hold of the metal basket on the front of the cart and began trying to tip it to one side so that the old man would fall off. The old man grips the side of the seat with one hand and uses his cane to jab Porkcilla in the knee. AG and I are just standing there, in a state of complete shock, staring. Porkcilla howls in pain and lets go of the cart. Old man takes this opportunity to drive as far away from Porkcilla as the cart will take him. Porkcilla is standing there howling and I snap out of my daze, nudge AG, and motion towards the door. I get his groceries out to the car where his sister is waiting for him (AG didn't want help with his everyday activities because he still wanted to be independent as much as he could). We must look like we've seen some shit, “What's wrong?” Neither of us can answer though, and go back inside where Porkcilla is on the phone with the police. I don't know what ever happened with that

TL;DR Army vets and old people are awesome

&gt;Be a random Friday evening, and i'm chowing down on some tasty vittles with some buds.

&gt;Group of five dudes walk in.  Pay no attention to them except that they are dressed in athletic gear of some kind like they came from rec league of some sport or something

&gt;My guess is the smaller of the two, and the other guy is some gross looking orca thing at around 5'7 and 350.   He is dressed in the biggest nike shorts I have ever seen (go down past his knees and look like a dress), a hoody, and a backward ballcap.

&gt;Looking at him is enough to inspire confusion and rage.

&gt;Call this creature Globulus Prime. He appears to know doorman.

&gt;Time passes.  Their food arrives.  The three normal dudes get biggish but regular orders. Fourth dude gets similar amount. But Globulus. . .

&gt;Globulus gets an order of thai nachos that feed three, and a coke to go along with his beer.

&gt;Hours pass.  I am quite inebriated.  So is everyone else. Especially table of dudes
  
&gt;Sixfootfat is verging on being asleep.  Globulus Prime is totally hammered and being very loud


&gt;Turn to face sudden noise.

&gt;Globulus and regular

&gt;TBM is a blond guy, far too large.  Makes him look waif like. Combine this with pale skin and a bad choice of glasses frames, and he looks like a stereotypical geek minus ginger hair and freckles. He is in his late 20s.

&gt;GP and TBM getting into it now.  I am like fifteen feet away so can hear everything.

&gt;Turns out TBM was sitting at bar eating chicken wings and GP just came over and helped himself to some.

&gt;TBM flips out

&gt;TBM responds with tirade of swearing.

&gt;GP justifies actions by saying TBM doesn't need the calories

&gt;Further accusations that The Bean Machine's lack of ~~fatness~~ size means that he is gay

&gt;Continue beaking each other.  Both getting angrier and angrier.  GP makes reference to the fact that he is more muscular (more like corpuscular) and is this close to beating the shit out of ""his skinny ass.""

&gt;Doorman comes over.  Tells GP and TBM to cool it.  They call each other one last round of names and then TBM turns back to the bar and bartender promises him free chicken wings.

&gt;GP is back down at his table

&gt;Paying close attention now

&gt;Makeup order of TBMs chickenwings arrive.

&gt;All five get up

&gt;TBM has had enough.  He slaps the chicken wing basket up into GPs face.

&gt;Doorman looks very concerned.

&gt;Begins to walk over.

&gt;GP, and mashes him in the face, totally destroying his glasses, tearing his shirt, and  causing him to fall off of his stool and onto the floor.

&gt;Everyone

&gt;Doorman is panicking.

&gt;TBMs shirt is totally destroyed.  Underneath it, as scrawny as initially thought.

&gt;No

&gt;I haven't been completely honest with you about TBM.

&gt;TBM does not really stand for The Bean Machine.

&gt;Doorman is panicking because his friend is about to get his fucking ass kicked.

&gt;TBM is The Boogey Man.


&gt;TBM picks himself up.  

&gt;He is so angry he is sputtering.  

&gt;His face is beet red and it looks like he already has a black eye.  Doorman gets in the way and puts his hands on his chest.  TBM grabs his shoulders and moves him out of the way in a fashion that is calculated not to send him careening into a table but to GTFO so he can begin to claim souls. 

&gt;GP throws another punch

&gt;Does not seem to have any effect.

&gt;TBM then reaches over behind the GPs head

&gt;TBM is now covered in (someone else's) blood and has shirt torn to shreds. Looks like modern day conan.

&gt;Melee breaks out.

&gt;Sixfootfat then throws a few punches.  TBM grabs his ear to haul his head down into punching range (all the while he is being punched from all directions btw)

&gt;Sixfootfat is not knocked unconscious, and he howls in pain and hops off in the other direction holding his face.

&gt;The Boogeyman then two hands one of the other guys so hard he sails through the air

&gt;All of this has taken under 15 seconds. And now the doorman has got back up and they break up the fight.  They basically pile on TBM and restrain him until he has calmed down.  It takes the four of them tremendous effort.

[Pt.6](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1izk9n/my_year_with_ginger_pt_6_one_leaves_the_nest/)

Soon after spring semester began, checking my phone calls and text messages, and threatening Eric to leave me alone when Yuri moved out. When I ended it with him, Luke naturally assumed it was just going to be a short break. A few weeks went by, and he realizes that I didn't want to get back together with him. He tried chocolate (Ginger ate those), Chinese takeout (Ginger ate those), and sweet talking. When that didn't work, did my heart beat in want when he called me a two-timing whore! Yuri and I were still pretty frosty then

Ginger's birthday is in January, as long as it ended before 2am and that she cleaned up after everyone had left. We particularly stressed the last part. Ginger asked us to join in on the fun- and contribute towards food, as if either one of us had the money to feed Ginger's appetite- but Eric and I had no plans to join in the festivities. He had work, and I was gonna stay the night at a friend's.

I had a major economics research paper that was due the Monday after Ginger's party (the party was on a Saturday). I'd been working on it for weeks and carried it around on a mini portable hard drive in my book bag since I mostly worked on it at the school library. I was going to finish it before I went off to my friend's house, in school, the library, at work, or something. The paper was almost done on my hard drive, but I had a copy that was about 60% done on my home computer. If I stayed awake the whole weekend, I could still finish it. So I called up my friend to let her know I wasn't going to make it, and started working.

Five hours later, but she got some of her older friends to bring the booze. Ginger looked so happy to be the center of attention.  And guess who was also invited? My ex and his friends. I went downstairs once to refill my coffee, and noticed them. Luke tried to talk to me, but I was able to avoid him.

About 12am, but Ginger just pops in, smiling like a creepy Cheshire cat.

&gt;""Lulu

Doubtful, not looking away from my screen, so Ginger goes with another method.

&gt;""He is so sweet and cute and I don't know why you would ever break up with him

Typing and refraining from mentioning how he's a slut-shaming

&gt;""I guess you just couldn't keep him since you've wasted away since school started and now he's looking for something real. If he hadn't met you first

I'm still calm

I wake up Sunday to chaos. I have a bunch of missed calls and text messages on my phone, but who cares? My Evangelical Christian parents, their friends, and everyone I knew in high school just saw a picture of me in bed with a boy. I ran out of my bedroom, ready to murder Luke, and goddamn. The whole house is a mess. Ginger didn't fucking clean anything. There was a bunch of trash on the floor, stains on the wall

I had a choice to make. Go after Ginger, Ginger was the big spoon.

I scream bloody murder

&gt;""HER!?!""

Luke looks embarrassed, and is casually naked. Freckles everywhere. It's an image I can't quite get rid of. Yes, I now know that the curtains match the drapes.

&gt;""Lulu

I can't handle this shit. At that moment

Eric must have been woken up by me yelling. I didn't even notice him standing behind me until he walked past me and started throwing Luke's clothes at him, get the fuck out of here."" Ginger started protesting.

&gt;""Eric

Luke, tells her to get the fuck up and start cleaning. Ginger complains that she's sick and can't get up. Averting his eyes from the two freckly mounds of milkbags on her chest, Eric demands that she pick up after her guests or that he'll call her parents and tell her what happened. Still complaining, Ginger gets up. No modesty in dressing in front of me and Eric. While she's getting dressed, she takes something out of her jewelry box and throws it at my feet. It's my portable hard drive.

&gt;""Too bad you were too busy to join the party.""

I'll end that part right here. I don't know if I made everything clear enough, she'd looked through Luke's phone when he'd passed out after their romp, found the private picture of us together, and posted it on his Facebook.

**Intro TL;DR: my family is fat

To preface, he pointed out how it was because I ate so many cheetos (my mom sent me to school with a large bag of cheetos everyday for lunch) and started calling me fat cheeto.

From then on I started giving away my cheetos and just stopped eating at school because I didn't want to be called fat burger or something.  At home I still ate the food because otherwise my sister would yell out ""AWAYS IS NOT EATING!!""  Inspired by the music video for Pink's ""Stupid Girls"" I made myself throw up.

Fast forward to freshman year of highschool, is 19, and my sister, Wandamelon, is 18.  Both live at home.


I had started to explore my body like most teens do.  It's about 3am and thinking that my family is sleeping


I reiterate


Wandamelon then throws the door open and THEN decides to declare ""AWAYS, still in the standing up motion, with the detachable showerhead detached.


She then gives me a pie-eating grin and proceeds to tumble out as fast as she can, ""AWAYS IS MASTUUURRBAATTIINNGGG!!!!!""  The news spreads amongst my family.  And extended family.  When my aunt visited three days later I heard my mom telling her about it, followed by an ""EWWWWWWW.""   They still hold it against me.


Fast forward to about a week after the incident.  My mom comes home from work


I go into the bathroom to check it out and only see a dome where a person should be standing through the curtain.  I pull back the curtain.  The dome shadow was my sister's stomach portruding from the bathtub.  She was on her back


You may be thinking that she was crying because she was caught masturbating or because she was stuck in the bathtub
I did too until she squeals ""I WANT TO EAT DINNER.  TELL MOMMY TO COME HERE, squeals ""EW GROSS"" and my mom screams ""LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID.""


At me.  She continues


My sister then snorts at them to stop and she says that she is soooooo hungry.  My mom sympathizes and gets her some chicken wings and my brother goes back to eating his portion.  The three of them took a food break while my sister was stuck in the tub

Side note, we're all gonna make it etc, but this lady had already pissed me off by sitting in the little Ladies Gym weight section when I wanted to be squatting my arse off. She sat on the floor and chatted to her mate for 25 minutes, during which she did a grand total of 2 sit ups. If I'm a gym bunny, she's a gym rhino.

What follows is a transcript

&gt;Mrs. Ginger: ""Hello?""

Me: ""Mrs. Ginger

&gt;Mrs. Ginger: ""Oh no

Me: ""Ginger is more than fine. We're calling you because we're having some problems with her.""

&gt; Mr. Ginger: (angry) ""Why are you calling us so early if it's not an emergency?""

Me: ""It's not an emergency Mr. Ginger

Eric: ""We're going to ask your daughter to stop living with us. We can't force her to break the lease or move out of the apartment

&gt;Mr. Ginger: (more angry) ""AND WHY THE HELL WOULD WE DO THAT?""

Me: ""In the past 24 hours, stolen my homework, and had sex with my ex-boyfriend.""

Eric: ""In the whole time we've all been living together, and repeatedly sexually harassed me. She also drove away one of our roommates.""

&gt;Mr./Mrs. Ginger: ""WHAT?""

At this point
&gt;""MY BABY'S NOT A VIRGIN?""
&gt;""YOUR DAUGHTER'S A WHORE!""
&gt;""I SENT HER FIBER SUPPLEMENTS!""
&gt;""SHE DRINKS?!""
&gt;""SHE'S SO FAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW BOYS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HER!""
&gt;""IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE HER LESS FOOD MONEY

One of them must have realized they never ended the call, so we decide to go to sleep. A few hours later, we hear a banging on the door.

&gt;""ERIC! ERIC! MY KEY'S NOT WORKING! OPEN UP!""

The new lock was completely different in color and style from the old one, and starts eating, acting like nothing is out of the ordinary. 
Eric calmly turns off the TV,"" he said. Mid-chew, Ginger says, ""What?"" I repeat that we don't want to live with her anymore. We tell her that we want her to move out, as soon as possible. Ginger starts sobbing, but doesn't stop shoveling down Mongolian beef and chicken wings.

&gt;""IS THIS BECAUSE OF LUKE? I WARNED YOU THAT HE WAS GOING TO FIND A REAL WOMAN SOONER OR LATER LULU YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT!""

I say it's not because of Luke, bitch and that I know that she put the photo of me up on Facebook. Ginger tried to deny it and say it was Luke who did it, then she starts crying harder (but not hard enough to stop eating, her tears mixed in with the Kung Pao chicken but I guess there was no taste difference?) and says she only took my hard drive because she wanted me to have fun and go to her party and that we were mean for not wanting to celebrate her birthday.

&gt;""LULU YOU'RE SO JEALOUS OF ME THAT YOU EXCLUDE ME FROM EVERYTHING AND YOU AND ERIC AND YURI CELEBRATED EACH OTHER'S BIRTHDAYS AND GAVE GIFTS TO EACH OTHER! NONE OF YOU GAVE ME ANYTHING! YOU'RE SO MEAN!""

Technically, says we're selfish for not sharing our food with her, that she shouldn't be punished for her ""condition,"" and she would have given me back my homework the next day and that I shouldn't have freaked out about it, among other delusions. We just cut her off, and repeat our demands. She had to move out at once.

&gt;""YOU CAN'T MAKE ME DO ANYTHING

But then mercy arrives

&gt;""YOU JEALOUS FUCKING BITCH! YOU TOLD ON ME TO MY PARENTS?""

Eric and I go outside, Ginger is not gone forever.

Dramagirl is gone

I had learned much under her tutelage, beta self and Saggy knew it.  She started to make aweful comments to me at every opportunity, and I still wasn't good at defending myself in a way that didn't make me sound stupid.  I'd always think of what to say hours later, or when I did say something, it was lame and uninspired.

My back was broken.

Saggy was born of the darkness.

**Much

After about a week

However

&gt; I was alone in the jungle

&gt; Found out after a few days that she'd figured out how to swipe a credit card or something to get into my room.  My cereal disappeared one day, open, and had skype recording.  I moved all my food to the area next to my bed where Skype was recording.  The food was a tiny sacrifice for what was to come.

&gt; Saggy started to make horrible comments to me anytime she came in contact with me.

&gt; ""Skinny bitch.""

&gt; ""Whore face.""

&gt; ""Got a boyfriend yet?  Don't bring him around or he'll be mine too.""

&gt; I was miserable.  For Christmas I asked for knives and swords.  I think deep down I wanted to stab that flabby bitch in the fupa.

&gt; Sometime early the next semester

&gt; She found me there, and whipped by Saggy.

&gt; I had lost all hope and therefore had nothing to lose in this hell-hole of an apartment.  I had no friends, though a necessary one), and had lost a very unhealthy amount of weight from my depression.

&gt; So I had been gathering my data

&gt; But I didn't want her ""moved.""

&gt; I wanted her destroyed.

&gt; I knew she had been skipping a lot of classes.  She fucking bragged about it.  She would've had to stop stuffing her face full of chicken nuggets for an entire hour and a half to attend a class.  That was just unrealistic guys!  So she was on the verge of failing out of school.  She did that bit for me.

&gt; She was smoking more and more

&gt; She would sometimes break into my room and steal bits and pieces of my groceries.  I had the videos cut and put into a nice little file hidden away on my computer.

&gt; It was the middle of March when I struck.

&gt; Saggy had just had a huge party the night before (ugh, and Missy was howling because she was still in heat.

&gt; She was there

&gt; When I called the police.

&gt; ""My roommate is smoking pot in our living room

&gt; I finished the call and tippy-toed to the hallway.  

&gt; There I waited (like a creeper

&gt; Suddenly the door opened.  I'd told them it was open and they were allowed in.

&gt; Saggy looked at the two police men in the doorway

&gt; ""Oh no honey

&gt; Saggy started to wail

&gt; ""I can't get arrested!  I'll get kicked out of school!  I'll get kicked out!""

&gt; ""You should've thought about that before you were a conniving bitch Saggy

&gt; She whirled around

&gt; She immediately started screaming ""SHE SMOKES TOO!  SHE HAS POT IN HER ROOM I'VE SEEN HER SMOKE!!!""

&gt; Police find pot in my room.  The bitch had fucking put pot in there.

&gt; I tell them they can check my urine or whatever all they wanted, and I can prove she had been breaking into my room and stealing my stuff.

&gt; Saggy starts thrashing around like a rabid squirrel

&gt; Unfortunately I was escorted back to my room to present the skype recordings I'd made while she continued to scream in the front room.  I did not see the carnage that unfolded

&gt; I quickly zipped through my video file for the cop

&gt; Saggy was upright and standing next to the wall crying as I came back to the living room with the other cop.

&gt; I say nothing

&gt; Hear the whalecall from all the way outside.

&gt; Immediately call Dramagirl and tell her to get her dad

Dramagirl and her dad were very close

We got the Dean of Students to corroborate my story with the police, and I went to the police department to give an official statement and such.  It was all super stressful, so I've kinda blocked it from my memory.  

&gt; ""Do you want to press charges?""

&gt; ""Oh my god yes.""

&gt; Saggy got kicked out, and served some amount of time for various things like possession, theft, harassment, false testimony and all that crap.  She made a plea-bargain or something and was let off easier than Dramagirl or I would've liked, and I actually think Dramagirl got some kind of compensation.  I didn't press for details.  Saggy was out out out, and we were free.  

&gt; We celebrated by filling the fridge with fruits and veggies.

**TL;DR: POLICE AND JUSTICE.**

Sorry if this is rushed, but this one seemed painful.  I'm actually glad it's over with now so I can return to writing the fun, fat-logic filled stories.  Next up is the Halloween Slut! Voted on by /u/Mikarevur.

So Hamela has sadly been taken from us

The date is June 1st, watching some Arrested Development, drinking a beer, and looking at some legal options. It is about 3pm and the sun is sinking lower into the sky, but it it still bright.

The lovely silence is broken by a rapping at my front door. I answer the door and I'm greeted by a man

""Hey!"" he says gruffly

This man is Hamela's husband

Back to the story...

""You bet he lives ere!""

Hamela is sitting sideways in the passenger seat with the door open. She's wearing a huge floppy hat

""Dont you stare at me like that! I'm married! Gotta keep mah *skin* outta the sun

Her husband is quite angry

""Are you tryin to start somethin?"" he says

""I don't f-find your wife attractive"", I stuttered because I was feeling kind of awkward.

Hambert saw this and started patting his gunt like he had gun in there. I couldn't really see anything under his gut though.

""Yah owe us a swim""

""I don't owe you anything"", that they thought that I was going to let them swim in my pool.

Hambert is yelling now

Hamela is still sitting in the car

""Yea

""It's people like you who make this world a horrible place to live! he said"". Hambert was exerting a lot of energy and was getting quite sweaty and red.

""We have **connections**""

I was done

I went back to my laptop and checked the camera.

Before they had confronted me

Fatties gonna use Fat Logic

I am currently pressing charges on at least Hamela. I need to meet with a lawyer to see if I can/should do anything with Hambert. Regardless

&gt;9 hours of church a day

&gt;hotterthanhell.jpg

&gt;Sleep constantly interrupted for middle of the night Jesus candle praying bullshit

&gt;brainwashing101.avi

&gt;Only thing keeping me sane is my friend Taylor
in her trash can.

&gt;Taylor is 17

&gt;Every day we have to walk up a steep ass hill to get to this stupid pre-church
before main church. It's the only time when we aren't directly chaperoned.

&gt;When I say ""steep ass hill""

&gt;Taylor and I have some inside joke. I don't remember what it is, so it's not that hard to do. Plus, I'm 15 and I think she's insanely hot, so any excuse for her to touch me is golden.

&gt;Enter Hamelia

&gt;Hamelia is about 5'5

&gt;Hamelia is at the camp

&gt;On a good day

&gt;Between the like 10 miles we have to walk every day

&gt;One day, when suddenly, in the whiniest voice imaginable ""Hey, I don't want to walk up the hill either, when do I get a ride?!?""

&gt;Hamelia wants a ride up the hill.

&gt;bonerisgonenow.jpg

&gt;I try to decline nicely

&gt;""Umm

&gt;Proceed to carry Taylor up the hill like I always do

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill

&gt;""No Hamelia

&gt;Taylor hops on

&gt;About half way up the hill

&gt;Hamelia spews ""Fine but I'm riding you tomorrow!!!""

&gt;bonerdeflated.gif

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill

&gt;Before Taylor jumps on Hamelia pushes her out of the way to get between us.

&gt;""IT'S MY TURN TODAY!""

&gt;Sick of being nice

&gt;""Hamelia. I honestly can't carry you up the hill.""

&gt;Tears form in the corner of the hambeast's eyes. Tears made of theater popcorn butter.

&gt;""YOU CAN TOO!!!""

&gt;""No

&gt;Truth is not very effective. 

&gt;Instead of realizing that I'm not Superman

&gt;""WHY DO GUYS ALWAYS WANT GIRLS WHO LOOK LIKE HER?!?""

&gt;Hamelia points a bratwurst of a finger at Taylor

&gt;""SHE DOESN'T HAVE BOOBS OR AN ASS""

&gt;At this point

&gt;""SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CURVES

&gt;Shit's not true. Like most of them women I've been attracted to in my life
wide hips, hamplanet curvy.

&gt;Hamelia turns back to me

&gt;""YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ME

&gt;All jaws are on the floor. Everyone in a 5 mile radius is watching.

&gt;""Taylor is real

&gt;Hamelia turns a deep shade of purple and leaves. 

&gt;Taylor doesn't ride me up the hill that day

&gt;nobonertoday.jpg

&gt;Hamelia doesn't show up at pre-church church

&gt;NEXT DAY

&gt;Approach steep ass hill

&gt;Sit through boring pre-church church. Some shit about abortion. Preacher keeps saying crazy things like how abortion has ""roots in the occult"" and is actually the worship of a god named Moloch.

&gt;idgaf.jpg

&gt;Pre-church church ends

&gt;The astute reader, really bad idea. It's just too hard to balance, going down something that steep with someone on you. We made it like 1/2 way down the first time, before giving up, because we nearly tumbled to our certain deaths at the bottom of the steep ass hill.

&gt;As I'm approaching the top of the hill I hear ""I GET A RIDE NOW"", about to land on me.

&gt;Hamelia slams into me with meteor force and wraps her fat

&gt;I landed face down

&gt;My pants have gaping holes where the knees are, my chest and stomach are skinned and bleeding, though not badly compared to everything else that's bleeding. My left ankle is sprained, my elbows and forearms are badly skinned and bleeding everywhere. Everything which is skinned is also conveniently full of little black pavement rocks and dirt. Wind is knocked out of me so badly that I can't breathe and while gasping for air, I see stars and pass out briefly Luckily, nothing is broken.

&gt;youshouldaseentheotherguy.jpg

&gt;Hamelia's left leg is shattered, somehow her tailbone and gets a concussion. She's also pretty skint up.

&gt;Ambulances come. Takes like 45 minutes for them to get there. Hamelia is out cold the whole time

&gt;Through all my pain I notice that it's taking like 8 EMTs to get Hamelia onto a stretcher.

&gt; his habits (sleep

hope starting to form...

&gt; next few gym days, he always says “ive been at it for an hour”. Sweat + wheeze make me believe him.

&gt; few weeks pass and always with the “been at it for an hour”. Tell HW that I'll be there at 3pm today but secretly show up @1 and his the bikes at the back of the gym. Don't see HW walk in until 2:55.

&gt; come out of the back

&gt;”Great! He's been lying to me.” i think #nohope

&gt; I say “what have you eaten today?” he replies “for breakfast, coffee, water. Then a snack around 11, and a chicken breast at 2”

&gt; i acknowledge... even though his stories are intersecting and you arent allowed to eat at the gym. #mentalnote

whatever

&gt; we continue until it's time to go and then hit the scales at the back of the gym

&gt; he steps on and he has actually gained 3 lbs.  He insists that it's muscle. I get annoyed and call him on it. The shame is apparent but i figure

&gt; he agrees and goes about his way

&gt; two days pass and i'm out for breakfast with a friend whom i havent seen in a while. Catching up is always fun.

&gt; i see out of the corner of my eye

&gt; 3 eggs covered in hollandaise, seperate plate of homefries cooked in grease and butter... i shudder. There is about 3000 calories on one plate and about 1500 on the other. I snap a picture from my table.

&gt; i see him in the gym later in the day. Told him we were meeting at three and i show up at 2. no sign of HW till 2:55 again. Ask him what time he got there, one bacon... only healthy stuff... lie #2. “hey HW, did you make your meals yourself today?” sure did, idgygdi. So much cheaper eating at home now! Lie #3

&gt; Literally toss him a towel and say “im out. Good luck but i doubt it”

&gt; “what are you talking about?” he says with such conviction that i would have believed him had i not seen him at the resto that morning. I show him the picture i took of him at the table with his calorie laden meal. Mention that ive been in the gym since 2pm. “I said don't lie to me. You lied to me just now. I'm done. Going home. You're a hopeless cause. Get yourself right and then call me.”

&gt; “WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T EAT!? I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.” he shouts loudly enough that the store next to the gym can hear what he's saying. (for reference

&gt; i pick up my things and make my way to the change room. He doesn't stop. He is yelling and screaming and it kinda of reminds me of fat bastard in austin powers “get in my belly”. I grab my shit from the changeroom and take off... dont even bother changing.

&gt; He calls me a bunch of times and i send his call to voicemail each time. I listened to the messages later that night and they started out pleasant “sorry” got angry

&gt; i shit you not, you owe me money. He said that it was illegal the moves that you were making me do and that you and I should talk and come to a settlement out of court. Call me back!”

&gt; I have never laughed so hard... legal issues now? Right. I wasn't giving him any advice on how to work out, exlax.

&gt; about a week later, he is entitled to a few thousand dollars worth of therapy to correct errors in his knees, back, chest, and lower abdomen.

&gt; i explain my side of things, back it up by the logic of it all and ask that the lawyer never contact me again with any thing related to this supposed “case”.

&gt; turns out the “lawyer” was HW's mom calling and pretending that she was a lawyer and trying to get some financial gain from the call. I could not believe it when I found out. I went to the gym and told them the story and they immediately took HW's membership away from him and barred him from that gym. Their reasoning for barring him was “So that our regular gym goers don't have their regular workouts affected by someone else's fat logic.”

oh

Going for my 10k run

So I'm on km 8

She sees me, but she is refusing to step aside so I hop onto the ice and keep going. I'm getting ice water flooding my shoes and ankles because ice is too thin that far off the path. If she had slightly moved over it would have been okay. 

As I approach her she starts flailing and yelling and clearly trying to get my attention so I slow a tiny bit and pull my headphone out. ""What's up?""

She's yelling ""stop stop stop stop!!!"" 

So I do because I think I'm on fire or something. I look down and around and see nothing and am standing ankle-deep in gritty ice water in those super fashionable toe-shoes. ""What? What's wrong?"" 

""Stop that

I think she means running on ice. ""Oh, no worries! Thanks, though!"" (I'm Canadian). I start to go on but she stops me by grabbing my arm. 

""And look what it's done to you!"" Here

""What... wait

""Running is destroying your body."" 

""... oh! No

""Oh

(I am 170lbs 5'6"" down from 250lbs

""Ugh

""... Look. I actually love running. I do it because I enjoy it and it makes me feel good."" 

""Oh, and sweating more. ""-- it's dangerous! It's going to give you a heart attack, and you'll die at a young age.""

""... okay... well... thanks for the warning... but I have to go."" 

""Stop. I'm not done. Just because you *can* run doesn't mean you *have* to! It's inconsiderate!"" 

""... inconsiderate."" 

""Judging everyone you pass by just because you're thinner than them!"" 

""... *judging*?!"" (I'm still technically overweight

""You don't know why I look the way I do!"" 

""... I never assumed anything

""I look the way I do because I. Have. Bad. Knees."" She says this while jabbing her finger in the direction of *my* knees

I just shake my head, to not walk away when she's speaking to me, telling me she'll be watching the papers for my obituary, really dumb shit.

1373910647.0,1icpoy,**¿Donde Esta the seating for Los Whalepeople?**,thefukizamatterwithu,967,199,125,"All inclusive in Mexico:


So I just got back from a week in the Mayan Riviera - had a weeks paid vacation that I needed to use up ASAP or I was going to lose it - and there are always cheap deals from Toronto to meheeco so I figured I could do with a week's worth of floating my liver, pasty white tits of mine and maybe get drunk and catch a few lizards. I was also looking forward to doing some landwhale watching while I was down there. The myriad of different introduced American species, not to mention the endemic Mexican Ballenas Terrestriales - Mexico having recently surpassed the United States as the ""Fattest Country in the World"" (Thanks Coca Cola and and Coca Cola products!) was enticing. So, with that being said, I stuffed a bunch of arbitary clothing into my suitcase that is currently doubling as my laundry basket, grabbed my passport, told no one where I was going


I don't know how to greentext (although I can dougie like a motherfucker), my life got shit fucked upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I came across the most annoying pod of baileen whales this side of the Aleutian Islands. 

The subject in this story is an entire family, to the hotel buffet, to the beach, to my snorkeling trip, these assholes were omnipresent, being loud and racist and obnoxious and fat in as many places as they could muster up the breath to be in. First and foremost, let me just preface eveything by saying, and less of a Steve Irwin,  internalizing and experiencing the unpleasant interactions with Triple F by all those around me as if they were my own. 


This is part one: ""¿Donde Esta the seating for Los Whalepeople?""


I'd just gotten off the plane, get a nice buzz going and hopefully pass out on the hourlong ride to the hotel. I had just cracked the cap on my luke-warm 40, when [enter left] Fat Fuckin Family. They looked like a sweaty, greasy Francisco Botero painting. 4 of the shortest, fattest, most dishoveled looking human beings I have ever seen. A breeding pair and their 2 male fledgelings (aged maybe 13 and 16). The dad must have tipped the scale at over 500 pounds. The mother, probably slightly less (subtract her massive orangutan tits that probably, produced a delishious crème brule

""Where is this fucking bus?"" oinked the mumu-clad matriarch ""typical fucking spics, but remember, you are now in THEIR fucking country, a country where people routinely find themselves in a mass grave with their dick in their mouth for minor infractions. You think visitors would be on their best behaviour??? 


""Dad I'm starving

""The hotel is an hour away, texts were sent, fat-facebook statuses updated (""jus got to MexiCANT. No Food. Hate beeners. Fukkin hot! Want to eat then die…) and I tuned them out so I could get back to being the best alcoholic I could be. 


The next sequence of events I am still


So the bus eventually pulls up 10 minutes later. We are apologized to for the late arrival by a very nice, obsviously. Everyone pretty much accepted this, including Triple F, much to my disappointment, because I was already looking for reasons to hate on them. So we finally load everyone onto the bus, when it's FFF's turn to get on. I can see their listless, beady eyes are scanning around for seats. In their haste and laziness, but hey…thin privilege is being able to sit at the front of the bus and not have people think you are too tired to walk to the back. The 2 kids are ""small"" enough to fit (barely) in 2 normal human-being sized seats. Los Papas…they know their bodies. They know there is no way they are fitting into a normal person seat

Cue gasps of indignation from our resident fat fuckin family. 

""Dad I'm starving"" reiterates the youngest of the little near earth objects. ""yeah Jim

""hey can we get going please, my kids need to eat, let's go buddy"" The chief fatass says, dutifully placating his hamwarrior wife. 

""I'm sorry sir"" the little mexican man driving the bus says

Hungry and too tired to protest

10 more minutes go by and enter our late guests. The bus driver again comes over the PA to let us know that the 2 remaining guests have arrived and departure is eminent. The relieft in the air is palpable. Next thing I know

In rolls the most adorable and pathetic sight I had seen in a long while: a couple

""Sir

""I can't move"" shouts Mr. John Q Fatfuck. ""the other seats are too small"". 

The bus driver then calmly proceeds to tell him that the other seats are all they have and that they have not been an issue for guests in the past. 


""I don't give a shit about OTHER guests"" yeah we know

Again, meanwhile, giving undeserved apologetic and empathetic looks to Mr. and Mrs. Triple O Sauce. 


Finally, and allow the handicapped woman to wheel her chair into the seat beside him, and the lady's husband can go and sit somewhere else. 


Fat Privlege is telling loyal



They pulled a lot more shit during the rest of the week I was fortunate enough to be able to report for you guys. Will post soon.

A few minutes later the cops roll up asking if we are the ones who called about a boy being molested. I knew exactly what happened, by this time Miranda had also left and I was home alone. It was maybe another 20 minutes before I heard a knock on the door. I know I should have expected this, but I didn't. It was the Manatees mother, again.

She goes on about how the police are making things up again and that I need to set things straight and tell the truth without being manipulated by skinny whores.

Eric and I met with our landlady to ask if there was any way to have Ginger kicked out after Eric's birthday. Our landlady, says there's nothing she can do and we should all just try to make amends. ""That sweet girl?"" she said, when we told her how Ginger was sexually harassing Eric and eating all our food. Our landlady didn't believe us as she and Ginger were church buddies, and that forever endeared Ginger to her. She laughed when we said Ginger had been sneaking to Eric's bedroom and said: ""Girls can't rape boys, honey."" Well, fuck you. We pretty much knew there was no hope after that. Ginger had also let it slip to our landlady that Eric was an atheist, and I suspect she was less sympathetic towards Eric because of it.

Ginger fact: Ginger didn't like facial hair on her men. Eric, and would have a blond five o'clock shadow by noon. Hearing about her aversion to a non-baby smooth face Eric starts to grow a badass mountain beard. It works to repel Ginger until Eric is forced to shave by his boss.

Luke and I get back together a week after the birthday dinner

Don't think I'd forgotten about Ginger though. I was plotting my revenge. Yuri, refused to speak with her, and just glare at her whenever we made any eye contact. Ginger acted like the whole birthday dinner and her unsuccessful seduction never happened. When she learned that Yuri told a friend at school what Ginger did, she yelled at him, furious that he was ""spreading lies about her."" Yuri, at this point, was spending more and more nights at Scott's because he was tired of dealing with her.

Around Thanksgiving

Yuri and I were the last to leave. I'd planted the evidence,"" I heard Ginger's mother saying to Ginger. Ginger was about to walk out the door with her parents, when I yelled at them to wait. This was the first time I initiated a conversation with Ginger in weeks, so she stopped. Her and her parents turned to look at me as I held out the negligee that Ginger had worn the night of Eric's birthday. ""I didn't want you to forget this, Ginger."" I found it in the trash ^tee ^hee.

Ginger's reaction was amazing. She gasped, older, fatter version of his daughter. It was like a vision into the future. Ginger always called him about her roommate problems, so he did not like me or Yuri. Especially Yuri. Ginger's mother just laughed, saying ""It was clearly a joke."" Ginger agreed to this really quickly and insisted that the lingerie was mine, until I spread out the negligee, showing how it was about 10x my size and just the right fit for their daughter.

Furthermore, horrified. Her Daddy looked like he was going to pop a vein in his forehead. Pointing at me, Ginger started crying hysterically. ""Lulu makes fun of me all the time, Daddy! She says I'm fat and no one's ever going to love me! She's jealous that I have so many friends and she's a loser! She's having sex with different boys every night and trying to seduce my boyfriend! That stuff's not mine, it's hers! Lulu's sick and a pervert!"" Bullshit after bullshit. Ginger's parents look like they want to believe their sweet, virginal daughter, but also as if they knew she was capable of having such atrocities. Yuri and I decide to leave because it was getting pretty late, Yuri and I texted Eric about what happened. He said the beauty of it brought a tear to his eye.

Too large to fit through the door normally, mumu-dress-bedsheet draped over a fupa that sticks out a good 3 feet. She rasps at me as she passes, ""BATHROOM?""

As we continue to bullshit about motorsports, grayfaced, staring at the asphalt. The ex-seal inhales the last half of his cigarette in one breath, transfixed at the rocking van. He flicks it to the ground and begins marching her way.

So I had this situation. I was living with a guy who beat up my dog. Red flags went up everywhere. Gotta get the fuck out NOW. Couldn't take the dog - he was a greyhound that I rescued from the track

Okay. Dog's happily rehomed. And now? Need to get the fuck out of here myself before this twit takes it into his head to attack me. Some chick I knew also wanted to move. K. Let's get a place. 

Terrible mistake. I moved in with a hamplanet full of fatlogic. She was about 5'5"" and about 350 pounds. Everyone exaggerates here

Walkthrough, Abby, they're only letting us in here based on mine. Also, I'm the one with an actual job. Besides, Abby, your room has the private bathroom. 

She sulkily conceded. WTF, she complained about it for*ever*. 

Move in: got all my shit in within 3 hours. Took one pickup. Couple of trips. Traded my smoker grill for the help. Still miss that thing. Another 2 hours

Her move in: apparently

She took one tiny box in

&gt;teehee gotta arrange things! 

 - meaning

&gt; I need the space on the counter for my electric can opener!

Do you not know how to open a can or something?! Look here

&gt; it's too harrrrrd!

&gt; *bitch

She was serious.  

Mind you

So there we all were, and she's hiding in the kitchen. Arranging stuff. Uh huh. 

YO ABBY get down here and pick up a box!

&gt; tee hee

Bitch

&gt; I have low blood sugar

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND?!

&gt; I'll order us some pizza! 

disbetterbegud.jpg

Then she made us all chip in. This is not how these things work. If people are moving your shit, fuck it. Just have some pizza and soda here when we're done.

Thirty minutes later

somethingtolookforwardto.mov

Two hours later, dehydrated, exhausted, and starving, on the living room floor, of which there is very little left because this bitch apparently owned half the fucking world. Boxes boxes everywhere; I am not exaggerating when I say that there were walkways between towering piles of boxes. What the fuck. All in the living room, of course, we couldn't pile anything in her bedroom. Except her piece of shit mattress. So. I can no longer use my living room until she gets all this shit out. *Spectacular.*

We hollered for our pizza and drinks

she brought out HALF of a medium cheese pizza. That's 3 slices. She also brought out glasses of water. 

What the actual fuck

Drag myself up

&gt; tee hee

&gt; the kitchen was already set up. That's all MY shit. Which I washed and put away yesterday. Kitchen looks no different except my coffeemaker's been replaced by a motherfucking electric canopener. 

&gt; well

isthisbitchforreal.png

We just stared at her. Then, nobody said a word. We shared out our 2 pieces among the six of us and everyone bailed the fuck out to go find some food, leaving me with this selfish cunt. They asked me to go and I said, ""nah, it's cool, I have some stuff"" - was also broke and too proud to admit it. Costs a lot to get a new place, especially when new roomie's credit is so shot that the apartment complex and every utility refuses to deal with her

Checked the fridge after she waddled off to bed with a smug smirk on her beady-eyed doughy face. 

All my stuff was gone. Nothing. Left. I had stocked that sucker to the point where my half was packed. I was amazed that even the veggies were gone. She didn't even leave me a fucking single radish. I stood there in shock. There was only my Brita pitcher of water

Looked at the sink. Did she cook? Welp. Apparently she did. There are all my pans

HOW IN THE LIVING HELL DO YOU TAKE ALL OF OUR MONEY FOR FOOD WHILE WE'RE WORKING OUR ASSES OFF FOR YOU, EMPTY THE MOTHERFUCKING FRIDGE, NONE OF WHICH BELONGED TO YOU, AND THEN TAKE 1/3 OF THE LAST REMAINING PIZZA, AND THEN LEAVE ALL YOUR SHIT IN A FUCKING CORNER AND **THEN** NOT EVEN FUCKING REFILL THE WATER PITCHER, THE SINK IS *RIGHT THERE NEXT TO THE FRIDGE* HOLY CHRIST. 

I showered off and went to bed hungry

Before you call me beta, because honestly? That's what I see fatlogic as, convoluted mental exercise taking the place of actual work. Not all of the Abby stories will be fatlogical, unless you take it in the context that her fatlogic permeated her entire miserable ""it's too harrrd"" life. This cunt was the epitome of fatlogic. Heaven forbid she ever stir her ass to do anything harder than waddle over to the motherfucking fridge and eat an entire tub of ice cream. Which I saw happen. Could not believe my eyes.

Today I share the mystery of the normal-size fatty.  Prepare a nice snack

&gt;Be me, looking for Mr. Right on okcupid.

&gt;Get messaged by a bigger guy, decide to go for it.  We'll call him PieGuy. 

&gt;We agree to meet for pie. Yummy

&gt;MFW I see him in person and he's not a fatty at all. He explains hadn't got around to taking pics recently- as in

&gt;PieGuy is cute and funny in person. We talk. He had weight loss surgery about 6 months before.  Thatexplainsit.jpg

&gt;We split a slice of pie. This is great

&gt;MFW he explains what happens when he eats more than a few bites of fatty food. (google ""dumping syndrome"" if you have a strong stomach). Next date

&gt;But hey, etc

&gt; a few dates later

&gt;go to his place. Offers me something to drink. Opens fridge. A ketchup bottle

&gt; his doctor says he needs more protein, cooking is a pain. So he drinks Ensure a few times a day. 

&gt;but he's so happy

&gt;in fact

&gt;but enough

Ok, it is understandable, right? Wait, I'm not actually that good looking.  :/

&gt;He squeezes a boob like /r/popping squeezes zits. Luckily

Umm

&gt;I decide to take control a minute

Whaaaattt. 

&gt;He gives his shame-faced back story. PieGuy married his high school sweetheart. She didn't like sex. Also, but couldn't leave her when he was fat because what other woman would have him?

&gt;I'm the  2nd woman he's done anything sexual with.  He's fumbling like a teenager because that's the last time he tried this. 

Thin privilege is hitting 40 with more than one sexual partner under your belt. 
 
&gt;We eventually get to penetration. He's amazed at what positions are possible when there aren't two refridgerator-sized stomachs in the way. Also, I basically just gained an inch of length on my dick!""

Thin privilege is having the base of your penis accessible

&gt;next date, Capri Suns, Hot Pockets, ice cream and candy. But still, better than living on Ensure, right? Nope, he explains the food is for his kids. 

I had friended him on fb at this point

&gt;I gently suggest that the nutrition classes he was required to take for the surgery could point him toward making better food choices for the kids at least

&gt;MFW he explained that the kids don't like healthy food

&gt;MFW he hasn't even tried to discuss nutrition with them. I think his plan is to have their stomachs stapled too. 

When last I saw him, and was getting a good portion of his calories from alcohol. He's not gonna make it.

Ginger's parents stay in town for two nights after Thanksgiving weekend. Their reason? To go through Ginger's bedroom and see how far their little princess had derailed from the path of moral righteousness. Ginger's new wardrobe of see-through tops, and her adult books and movies were trashed. I was nice enough to volunteer to place those depraved, sinful objects in the dumpster for them. Or so Ginger's parents thought. Wearing gloves, Yuri and I went through the pornography- Ginger had amassed herself quite the collection. Most of it was hentai, but there were some pretty hot titles in there. (I, of course, did not keep any of this vile pornography for my own personal use. And if I did

&gt;""Lulu
&gt;""Sorry Ginger

&gt;""Yuri
&gt;""Scott and I used it last night to recreate *All Star Cream Pies*."" 

The fun didn't end there. Ginger's mother tasked Eric and I the duty of becoming Ginger's moral guardians. If Ginger behaved or said anything that was in any way unChristian, although we had no intentions of following up on that plan. By that time, they already found out that Ginger was lying to them about Eric being her boyfriend, but Ginger's mother insinuated that if Eric had any interest at all in their daughter, they wouldn't mind it one bit. 

&gt;""My

Ginger's mother looked a little insulted that her daughter's future husband turned her down without any hesitation whatsoever and fled the room in fear. 

But, malice, and casual disregard for anyone but herself, she actually made decent grades. But her parents were watching her bank statement like hawks and they'd significantly reduced her grocery budget. Ginger always bought all the expensive frozen meals and name-brand Oreos before, now she'd taken to stress-eating generic mallomars and whatever frozen pizza was on sale. Stress-eating Ginger and normal eating Ginger were apparently very different things. Normal eating Ginger had four meals a day (each a nutritious blend of frozen fried chicken, pasta alfredo trays, Kids Cuisines) and snacks in between those meals. Stress-eating Ginger did not stop shoveling food in her mouth. Her post-finals shit was really special. That was when Eric stopped sharing a bathroom with her and using mine and Yuri's.

The atmosphere in the house got better after finals had gone by. Everyone had passed their exams, Yuri even told her to have a safe drive home. Mistakenly, I thought that this was progress. Yuri had invited Scott to spend Christmas day with us in our hometown. Eric was invited too, but had to stay in town for work. I spent a week with my boyfriend's family upstate before going home and joining them. That was when Yuri dropped a bombshell on me. He was moving out of our apartment. He'd talked to the landlady, and when we went back to school in January he was moving in with Scott.

""I can't handle living with that monster anymore. I'm sick of smelling crap everyday and hiding my food, but I felt blindsided and betrayed. I didn't talk to Yuri again until after school started, and only after he bribed me with mint Milanos and Starbucks. Eric was shocked too, but more forgiving. He even joked that Yuri was smarter than both of us because he'd figured a way out of our home sweet home. Boy, was Eric right.

Ginger was just biding her time. I thought exposing her in front of her parents would bring her to submission. It turns out, she was waiting for her moment to strike. But I'll get to that later.

Backstory:  
I used to be a painting/renovations contractor before I got into real estate
One of my friends owns a high end autobody shop, it's more of a top 25% car).  Instead of me paying him $20,000 or so for the work, I would rain screen and paint the exterior of his bodyshop.  Everyone wins, except the tax-bro.  
  
Side-note:  His shop is on a busy street, and will leave a light sugary dusting on a 100 foot radius, especially noticeable on parked cars....  Hence the blocked parking lane and traffic control.  
  
To get this job done in the allotted time
- A crew of 4 painters
- Two 60' boom lifts.  Like these:http://www.rent1.net/CMSuploads/product_images/210_2_image1.jpg  
  
I should note that the rental cost for these machines is around $1000 a day.  Each.  
- two large airless paint sprayers with a two hoses/guns each  
- four traffic control persons (flagmen for you social justice shamers)  
Each flagman costs around $30/hr all in.  Employment insurance is huge for these guys
  
So
  
The flag-men set up cones every 5 feet with visibility tape between them
  
At 9am I sound the horn (I bought an air horn just for this
  
The architect has spec'd out elastomeric
  
About 11:30am
But what's this?  Over the roar of two diesel engines and two gasoline sprayers I hear the sound of a car in its death throes.  The groan of fatigued metal
No.  
It is a black Mini Cooper leaning dangerously towards the drivers side - the camber impossibly out like it's been stanced.    Example:  
http://scrapedcrusaders.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mini1920.jpg  
  
As it approaches
I recoil in horror as I look in the window.  A large portion of the car is taken up by the driver - the mass is centered over the driver's seat
  
In short
""Move that stuff out of the way so I can park""  

""Sorry

""You can't close the parking
  
""No

Herein we have another one where fatlogic is present only in the sense that it pervaded everything she said or did. Or, convoluted mental exercise taking the place of actual work."" She was a fucking black belt in this.

Okay! So here we are

Now, since she needed the fax machine. She also would demand 20 bucks for gas money when she did, as per our agreement: she drives, I put gas in the car. Apparently, a single 2-mile drive per week constituted her end of the deal. I put up with it under the illusion that she'd use the gas to look for a job. 

Comes a week when she suddenly doesn't need to use my work's fax. Ask her about this.

&gt; the leasing office has a fax machine I can use

Um

A bit more time goes by. 

Arrive home in my usual state of sweaty exhaustion from trudging two miles in 100+ heat, but I do at least try to stick with stuff that doesn't come out of a can, box, or bag. Odd, though, this sudden explosion of groceries. Enough food to last a normal person 2 months. Will prob be gone within a week. Whatever. 

Shower, the Bitch Squad (myself and 4 other friends) discovered that today was her last unemployment check. Because this clueless dipshit saw fit to post about it and how she ran right out and spent it all on groceries because she knew I'd be asking for money for bills. 

What. 

Back to kitchen. Time to confront the landwhale in her natural habitat. 

&gt; yo. Electric bill's due

Considerable stammering and obfuscation and general dodge-and-weave on her part. None of that irritating ""tee hee"" shit this time. I know many of you think that ""tee hee"" is a sign of a fake story. I assure you

Eventually: 

&gt; well

&gt; I never share? How can I? You eat all my food. Anything I buy is gone before sundown. Money. Now. 

&gt; I just TOLD you I don't have any! *said in whiny voice

&gt; When's your next check then? Next week

Finally she admits that she has no more unemployment. At which point I ever so testily inquired how that is possible

I had her cornered in our tiny-ass kitchen, slam bedroom door*

WELL. It will surprise nobody in this sub to hear that she hadn't bothered to apply for any jobs

Something in my expression at this point scared the living shit out of her. 

&gt; SO. This means you've got a job then

&gt; ....no

&gt; so who's paying rent and bills then? 

&gt; you SAID when we moved in that you make enough to cover that! 

&gt; I...wait... what?! That's my general rule, it was NOT meant to tell you that it's perfectly cool for you to quit doing anything whatsoever and let me support your fat ass! GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR.  

Hauled her fat ass off to the nearest big box store, and she'll get a check three weeks down the line.

Come home next day. 

&gt; How'd the interview go?

&gt; oh *tee hee* I didn't go

*stormclouds begin to form over my head

&gt; .... explain this to me

&gt; I got distracted chatting online

&gt; say again?

&gt; I got distracted chatting online

&gt; You. Blew off the interview. Because you were fucking around online. On MY computer. Using the Net access I pay for. 

At this point I completely lost it. She was sitting in front of said computer at the time.

Kicked her the fuck out. Put a BIOS password on my machine. Fuck you

Taped a sign over the thermostat, sitting in here all day, and it's not like SHE pays for it! This sign contained considerable cussing about people who don't pay bills or rent and who are not allowed to touch the thermostat, which I set back to 85.  

Trotted my ass over to the leasing office to have a chat. 

Come home to more emails from Bitch Squad. They found Flabby's LiveJournal

She posted this using MY computer and MY Net connection, she couldn't even be bothered to use a shift key. 

If I knew I had no money coming in, I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY, WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT, OF COURSE I WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING. NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO YOUR HALF OF THE HOUSEWORK EITHER! THAT WOULD BE A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. PLEASE, EAT ALL MY FOOD TOO, IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED IT. I SHALL LIVE ON AIR AND EMPTY PROMISES. YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN YOUR MOUNTAIN OF FLAB AFTER ALL. WOULDN'T WANT YOUR BLOOD SUGAR TO GET LOW. (I heard this excuse more times than I could count, usually when inquiring what happened to my food) &lt;--- there's your goddamn fatlogic right there. She was ENTITLED to my food. She had a CONDITION! 

Fuck that shit. 

Meanwhile

I set out to make her life in that apartment as miserable as she'd made it for me. No you cannot has computer or thermostat. Or cable, it's just that most of it bores me. Dunno why.

Hounded her mercilessly for hours upon hours about bills, shall we? You don't have a job, you don't even bother looking for one, so *certainly* you have plenty of time to do something about the motherfucking fleas, spiders, raw chicken, all these motherfucking boxes everywhere, seeing as I have no food because a certain fatfuck roommate kept eating it all so I quit buying any - the trash bags sitting by the front door (I seriously could not believe it... just to get the hell away from me, I was inclined. Nothing in my life was as interesting just then besides yelling at her every second I was home. GOT A JOB YET

We are now 2 1/2 months into this mess. Two weeks to go!

Come Monday, bitch. 

I have been condensing the hell out of this

Living in a fairly active city there are lots of bike trials for cyclists to enjoy just outside of town.

On my daily ride I began to notice the same man (~25 years old) riding the same trial as I do (not too advanced but still a nice workout) 

This man will now be know as Bikebro

I begin to notice Bikebro EVERY time I go riding, he always smiles back and is friendly.

One day I am riding along the trial when I see Bikebro pushing his bike with a flat

Now I like Bikebro

While I am fixing Bikebros tire he begins to share basically his life story with me

We talk from a bit and I tell him how I did similar to what he is doing and he seems to find motivation with my story. I think he just needed someone to talk to and I was happy to help. 

I finish with his tire and Bikebro thanks me like 20 times along with wanting to pay me for the tube

I still continue to see Bikebro when I ride and I am not worried about having to buy a new spare or spending 15 mintues helping the guy because I know that Bikebro and his sweaty red face are going to make it. 

* edit * since people are saying this doesn't fit the structure of a normal fat logic story let me add this, beliving that being big meant he was tough and therefore didn't care what people thought of him, but now relizes he is just fat and scared of change. 

I like to think that just talking to him for those 15 with someone who was like him help him

In which we learn about some family history.

In early September, and looking for a more long term, non-booty call based relationship. I said I'd be really interested in seeing him more often, but if that wasn't what he wanted, it was time to part ways. He pulled a really big show about wanting to be with me, and said he ""wanted to commit to being the best boyfriend possible."" 

Who's ready for a shocker; he turned out to be even more of an ass then I thought he was. About a month in, I got a message on Facebook from an ex of his, who he had been trying to sleep with recently. She sent me a screen shot of Steve Facebook-messaging her the day before asking if she was down to ""be fuck buddies again…and then some"". I was so upset; I felt humiliated for developing real feelings for him just to be bulldozed by some high school grade bullshit. I called him immediately, fought with him on the phone for two hours, then hung up when he told me to ""get over my daddy issues"". I went to work, shed not a single tear, got home, after crying the whole night, too) 

Maggie knocked on my door somewhere halfway through my second run of ""For Emma, until she threw me an ugly glance, and realized I was upset. ""Are you crying? Does this have anything to do with you screaming on the phone last night?"" I ended up spilling the whole story to her, probably because it was the first in-person conversation I had about it with anyone. She was surprisingly sweet about it, asking questions and expressing SYMPATHY. I suspected this was great for her because she finally got to use those 3 classes in relationship psychology on me. I didn't even mind. I ended by  telling her about his ""daddy issue"" comment, which I had to explain, which led to a full fledge bonding moment. 

My biological dad died when I was in the fourth grade, or really *entered* the workforce. She married my dad at 19, had me at 20, and been a stay at home mom ever since. John's mom, Betty, who was our neighbor, started taking more and more care of me, and his mom had to get a job and support three boys by herself.  Betty helped my mom get back on her feet, and why i didn't fail the fourth grade. 

Maggie shared with me that her mom, and taught her little Maggie that all men are cheating scum, no exceptions. She took mine and John's family stories as more proof that her mom was right. First off, I told her my dad got killed by a drunk driver, but nope, she launched into a diatribe about men. Men this, men that. She told me that it was better to just be HAPPY for yourself. ""That's what I eat what I want. Did you know that your body actually retains weight if you are sad?""

""No. I didn't know that Maggie. Did you read that on Tumblr?""

""No

""Okay

"" Here's the thing, so you just eat and be happy. It's like me and John.""

I sat up in my bed. ""Like… you and John?""

""Yeah. Sometimes he acts so into me

""Maggie… I think you're making too big a deal of it. He's got a girlfriend. We are his friends.""

""That's your problem, hate, lust, power. Can't fight it.""

""Did you read that on Tumblr

""Yeah. I'm going to get ice cream."" She hopped off my bed

""Yeah?""

""…Do you want some ice cream?""

""No

""Okay good

""…Yeah

This tale occurs my first summer of being a 'true' teen( at least I thought o was) 
So

be me, around 105-110lbs. 
Don't be, 5'9 and I would guess 350lbs.  
My Aunt, and my mom, being convinced that I and said hammy needed to spend some time together, agreed.  The first few days went by without incident, and cousin hammy was content taking up my TV all day playing video games and generally adding to his already bovine figure. 
Then came the day that caused my mother to snap. 
For the past 3 days, there was an odd stench originating from it, which no matter how much cleaning my mother did, she could not rid the air of the putrid smell. 
This day, the smell grows to such a stench, my mother gags, runs as fast as I've ever seen that tiny woman run, grabs a towel, and gloves. 
After she wrapped the towel around her head as a mask
Low and behold the vile aroma doubled ten fold. 
Let. Me preface this by saying
The pullout mattress was filled with old nasty urine and shit stains
As I helped my mother peel the coverings off, and shit into them, there were maybe three total, and the feces was brimming the holes. 
My mom twirled to my room where cousin ham was currently plopped in front of my TV gorging himself on god knows what. I follow her
She walks in front of the TV, needed help getting to the bathroom and apparently we didn't hear him yelling for help( note, my mom and I are very light sleepers) and since our hearing failed us, we deserved it. 
My mother lost it. She hit pitches that I never even thought possible. She somehow got his bulbous form off of the floor to a standing position
Afterwords she called my Aunt
I sat in my room while my mom and Aunt had a yelling match over why my hamplanet cousin was in the right for what he had done. After maybe twenty minutes of this

Parts of the park are around 30 years old, when the hambeasts were less numerous, so the slides were not designed with them in mind.

One slide in particular, filled with sharp turns and has a feature where the slide attendant can press and release a foot pedal to let loose an ""blast"" of water to push the rider down the slide. Bruises are relatively common on this slide, and in a given season there are usually several people who get concussions. Because of physics, larger people are at a greater risk, so there are large signs posted on the stairs. 

DANGER
MAXIMUM WEIGHT ON BLASTER: 250 LBS

Most people either head the warning on the sign or respond politely to the slide atteandent's mildly worded ""recommendation"".

Enter the behemoth. 300+ lbs of bacon grease in a bathing suit

I couldn't lie and say that the slide is temporarily closed because a kid just went down.

""Excuse me
""ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT?""
""No. It's just... the slide is mostly for kids
""FUCK OFF
""It's for your own safety. You could strain your back or hit your head be seriously injured.""
""BULLSHIT! YOU'VE LET PEOPLE BIGGER THAN ME DOWN! (nope) I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR DISCRIMINATION!!""

I'm skinny, It's not like I can stop her. Despite my pleading, and threatening her with expulsion from the park, she pushed me out of the way, lumbered past and plopped onto the slide. Her rolls clogged the entire flume, not unlike the cholesterol in her arteries 

""GIVE ME A BIG BLAST!""
""What you're doing is extremely dangerous. a blast would make it worse. You have to stop""
Then she looked at me like she was trying to be cute
""I WANT A GODDAMN BLAST

I told her that she wasn't getting a blast
I radioed down to guard at the bottom and my supervisor to explain the situation and warn them about a possible injury.

The whale shot down the slide faster than I have ever seen (teenage lifeguards are dumb, even after all that yelling. Maybe that's because screaming is kind of like exercising. 

She hit the water with a loud smack. I expected that she would be unconscious, she started flailing her stumpy limbs. The guard jumped in and helped her out of the pool (she could float, but apparently couldn't swim).

She was clearly banged up and a bit disoriented and unsteady

She was kicked out of the park soon after. It was something about belligerence and ice cream in the lazy river.

Hello again, I came back to a pretty full inbox on Reddit and figured I would treat you all to Part Six of the story!  Priorities, right?

If you are just clicking on this to see what this story is about

In this chapter

Daisy practically disappeared into her room for the next couple of weeks after *Apocalypse Now* occurred, which was a miracle in of itself.  Alex was back in regular hellish schedule mode while Alicia and I were focusing on our studies.  However, within just a few days of one another, Alicia, Alex, and myself, all ended up dating people.

Alicia had ended up going on a couple of dates with a guy from one of her classes.  We shall call him ""Brian"" for the story's sake

The weekend after *Apocalypse Now*,"" home with him because she was going through some drama and didn't want to deal with a psychotic ex-boyfriend (I'll have a footnote to this story at the end that doesn't really deal with this tale itself, but it's pretty crazy) and ended up being more than just a shoulder to cry on.

As for me, make lewd comments, and buy me a drink.  Guys, pay attention:  We notice.  Steve and I met up for lunch and hit it off right away.

Daisy, creating the central theme (SHOCKING!) for this chapter.

Sundays were basically recovery days for all of us, Alex and Erica came out of his bedroom and joined us.  We had all met each other before this, but hadn't really spent any time since all of our schedules were vastly different.  We were enjoying our lounging until the thundering began.

&gt;be me

&gt;sexytimes can be hard work!

&gt;Steve and I snuggled up.

&gt;Alex and Erica the same

&gt;Ugh

&gt;To be honest

&gt;Probably double for Alex

&gt;""Daisy

It bears noting, mainly because of the couple of nuclear explosions he had.  Still, she would eventually act like nothing had happened after time passed and erased it from her memory.  When this happened, Daisy would endlessly flirt with Alex in the short time he was around, even though he would just disregard it or tell her to knock it off every time.  The girl didn't understand that he wasn't into her at all, and also disregarded the fact that we agreed there would be no roommate relations.

&gt;Alex not in mood

&gt;None of us are

&gt;Steve is in a trance

&gt;Erica looks....disturbed

&gt;I sigh

&gt;""Daisy...this is Steve and Erica

At this point, they were pretty good for each other.  I had to explain the shit that happened to Steve later on just so he understood what it was all about.  He just wanted to know if this shit happened all the time, to which I basically just shrugged.

**TL;DR - Awesome roomies and I get dates and sexytimes!  Hamplanet gets jealous of Alex's new girl and pays random guy to try and make Alex jealous.  Hilarity had by all when real story comes out!**

*Footnote:  I said I would come back to the quick note about Erica.  One of the reasons she was very quiet around us at first was that she was dealing with an ex-boyfriend who would routinely call her and text her, she was getting a restraining order against him and had been staying with various friends.  Alex admitted to me a few weeks after that he kind of felt bad that they ended up sleeping together so soon, but it seemed that she genuinely cared for him and it wasn't just a ""white knight"" situation.  The ex never became any bigger issue, though.  He ended up in jail for possession of some type of drug (never found out what) and Erica was much more open after that.*

TL;DR I encounter the largest human being I have ever seen

This will be a three parter

I promised this story a while back and finally have a slow day at work to type so… here it is. Just so you all know

The setting here is the same as the one in [Lardquisha and the Moons]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d4s3e/part_1_lardquisha_and_the_moons/), and I’m loving this job. T, GHB, and I are all working tonight, so I’m pleased as punch. I’ve been at class all day, so I pull into the parking lot to take a nap in my car, seeing a huge thunderhead in the distance. Love the rain, this will be a restful 2 hours. Thunder booms in the distance


&gt;Be me, my shift starts at 11pm


&gt;Tired


&gt;They always got a couple of spliffs (cigarettes rerolled with weed and tobacco) to share


&gt;Take a couple mellowing draws, so ominous. I have to agree


Neither of these two spoke much English, naturally we became friends. They were the best, but I have a FPS about Mexiplanet—turned out he was kind of an asshole. Language barriers don’t dampen fatlogic.

&gt;Get my typical wake-up dinner


&gt;Sitting in the food court


&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stand up as oranges fall from their displays and begin rolling towards the door as an object with a massive gravitational force draws near


&gt;But still I see nothing. I can only hear the sound that could be likened to a blacksmith pumping a bellow


&gt;After about 10 minutes and 20 or so thumps


&gt;It twists, and with a final growled “Muhdder *FUCKER*” it emerges into the store proper and I get a look


Prepare your imagination Reddit
&gt;This woman was a certified hamgalaxy. I estimate her weight to be just under 700 lbs


&gt;She was wearing a massive purple T-shirt that at one point had a Looney Toons character on it


&gt;Lowest roll could be classified as a pannis


&gt;Sweatpants adorned the legs (a matching purple


&gt;The calves (for the sake of consistency) also had a 360 roll that fell on her disgusting feet like she was wearing a perverse pair of fleshy pants


&gt;Sores… so many sores. Several inches of asscrack


&gt;The ghosts of bad dye jobs past could be seen up and down the ponytail


&gt;As a bonus


&gt;I’ll let you all guess whether she was wearing a bra or any kind of undergarment. Not that she needed a bra


&gt;Oh


&gt;To my surprise


&gt;In the child’s arms was a dirty pile of blankets


During these observations my slightly high mind comprehended that I was now late for my shift, what was she doing here?! I realized I had moved closer and was now practically crouching behind a display of oranges, hadn’t even noticed that I’d moved.


&gt;Daughtermoon speaks to the galaxy


&gt;Galaxy is huffing, she wavers… holy shit she’s gonna pass out


&gt;Galaxy closes her eyes


&gt;”Muh muh?” thinks I, her head rolls back eyes still closed, but lo! It speaks again


&gt;”MUH MUH…” *wheeze wheeze* “…MUH MUH JUS’ NEEDS UH GET HER MEDICUN…”  *wheeze* “…DEN WE CUN GO…” *wheeze wheeze*


&gt;Ah


&gt;”HALP MUH MUH GIT A SCOOTUR MUH MUH TOO TI-YARD TUH WALK” says Muh Muh to daughtermoon


&gt;Ah, insulin probably 


&gt;Daughtermoon is familiar with this ritual it appears


&gt;I note her steps have an undertone of clinking


&gt;Daughtermoon is a human cane


&gt;In this fashion


A note about the scooters: we had been having a recurring problem of having people so large they either couldn’t fit in the scooters or the scooters wouldn’t move because their weight limit was exceeded. Then we had a faulty one that ran even though the weight limit was exceeded, corporate sent up 4 industrial, extrawide titanium-reinforced carts that had a weight limit of 700lbs (if I recall). I remember silly teenage girls piling onto those,  3 sitting comfortably in the seat… These things were MASSIVE.


&gt;Muh Muh finally reaches one of the said carts


&gt;As her ample bottom reaches the seat


&gt;She grabs and picks up her giant left leg (it hardly bends) onto the floor of the scooter


&gt;She tries to wiggle straight into the seat


&gt;Enraged


&gt;Something in the back support breaks


&gt;Since she entered the seat sideways, lean the opposite way and pull the folds above the arm rest


&gt;This process is repeated until all folds on both sides are above arm rest


&gt;Muh Muh is ready to go; I genuinely wonder whether the cart will move—it does! Slowly…


&gt;Daughtermoon places blankets and purse in basket and jumps on the back


&gt;The back tires are now rubbing against the tire guards


&gt;The poor electric motor struggles


&gt;Muh Muh is on her way to meet destiny


&gt;I know in the pit of my stomach that a life-changing event is coming

So having read that

There is a little paved path that is visible on the 2nd camera. This path leads to the fabled unlocked gate that Hamela Anderson herself had been using.

The night of the first incident

So I'm checking the camera and I see something that makes me want to punch my laptop screen. I caught Hamela on May 28th, so I do something kind of evil.

I decide to do two things actually. The 2nd one will be calling the police.

I go to the shed and look at all the pool stuff. I take the algecide and powdered chlorine

The camera I have is an IP camera

Hamela Anderson comes back, (teehee) she lounges in my backyard for about 3 hours. Since I don't have any cameras pointed at the pool I can't see how long she swam for. She leaves, but I can't see much on her condition because the camera is quite Black and White.

Friday I take a half-day off of work. I come home and check out one of the 2nd floor windows facing the pool. I can see her

Oh your back! I say

Yea! And ya can't take mah clothes I hid em real good so ya can't harass meh no more.

She looks pleased with herself

[How this will turn out for her](http://24.media.tumblr.com/1c50914b0a66b0a4c3da74bea7c43db1/tumblr_mlocs8QKEX1s917bwo1_400.gif)

""You really shouldn't be swimming""

""I chemically shocked the pool to clean it

Hamela looks at her skin

""Yu posoind yur water? Yu can't do that

I can do whatever I want

""Im gunna sue

Not really sure what to say after that

""Shut the fuck up, even though I was mad, those words seemed especially hurtful.

She literally starting talking about the word lard and than about lard vs fat

The police came through the side gate and Hamela absolutely flipped her lid

She started screaming about how I threw acid on her and how I was about to rape her

Cops starting to eye me so I give them the DVD and start talking about what happened.

""I really needed to shock my pool, she got chemically burned"".

Cops order her out of the water

They handcuff her and start to take her to the gate.  mirandarights.jpg

""NO wait! I need mah clothes! They're hidden so he wont steal em!"" 

The cops want to stop being cops as soon as possible

I begin the laborious task of balancing the pool water

As some of you may have read from a previous comment, except one family because their invitation got lost in the mail.^teehee So if they weren't on vacation this might not have happened. I blame you FPS for wanting more!

&gt;Time to green this bitch up!

On second thought, setting up, preparing, so far so good. No sign of The Manatee yet, I doubt she will show, right guys? ^guys?^right?please...^help^me. It's later and people start showing up, no Manatee yay! All the kids show up in swimwear as we could use Jessica's pool for tonight, wearing a bikini looking all sorts of fine. We talk

**SPECULATION BEGINS**

Hello I'm the Manatee and I'm a fucking delusional fuck who thinks someone likes me and I will go over to a party I'm not invited to and cause trouble. So, chat them up, introduce myself as their childs new girlfriend and then chat everyone up telling them I'm the girlfriend of the boy who lives here. I'm also going to eat a lot of food, drink tons of beetus juice and be a general nuisance.

**SPECULATION ENDS**

I immediately understand what happened and I walk outside

&gt;Me ""WHAT THE FUCK!? YOU NEED TO FUCKING LEAVE BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE!""

&gt;Manatee ""Yeah you fucking slut

&gt;Me ""I WASN'T TALKING TO HER YOU FUCKING COW! I WAS TALKING TO YOU! IT'S YOU WHOSE BEEN HARASSING ME!""

&gt;Manatee ""No I haven't, let's kick her out and talk.""

&gt;Me ""NO! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND JUST FUCKING LEAVE!""

&gt;Random person ""Hey

&gt;Me ""SHES NOT MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND

Now during this I had been squeezing Mirandas hand pretty hard because of all this fucking rage

&gt;Miranda ""He doesn't like you

&gt;Manatee ""YOU! YOU'VE BEEN STEALING **MY** BOYFRIEND! AND YOU ASSAULTED ME YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL!""

&gt;Me ""Remember you called the police that day

The Manatee walks up to me and tries to grab my arm and pull me away from Miranda. I in my infinite rage wisdom readies to punch her but Miranda squeezes my hand and I realize what I'm about to do and stop myself

I sidestep and make her miss, Miranda enters and closes the door behind her and sits next to me. I just starts ranting and she is agreeing with everything. I must have dozed off with her shortly after because when I woke up she was still there.

Later the Manatees father came over and had no idea about what had happened since they moved in because he had been gone for work. He told me his daughter has been acting unreasonably and been out of line and she wont bother me again. If she does I should tell him or call the police depending on the severity. I then told him if she ever speaks to me again I will get a restraining order and this will become a criminal matter.

I was going to wait until tomorrow to post up the next installment, you've read up on the awesome house and deciding to live with Alicia, Alex, and Daisy, our hamplanet.

Alicia and I were both taking summer courses for the sole reason that we got to stay in the dorm until we could move into the house.  It was so hard to do so because we were eager to not be living in a room.  Alex was still living in a dorm as well, though, since he worked so much.  His room, in his own words, was simply a place to pass out most of the times. I would really understand just how hellacious his schedule was after just a couple of weeks.

Daisy was not on campus after the semester ended and she lived a couple of hours away, we had to settle for places that let in under 21 people and Alex, even though he was a year older than us (he took a year off after high school before going to college) had no issue with it.  He was all about good company, and we all had pretty similar tastes.

Anyways

&gt;Move-in day is finally here!

&gt;Alicia and I couldn't even sleep

&gt;8am

&gt;Meet up with other awesome roomie Alex.

&gt;Alex looks dead tired.

&gt;Says he worked until 5am and got maybe an hour of sleep.

&gt;Feel bad for the guy

&gt;Open up house for first time!  Totally awesome feeling!

&gt;Bzzzzz

&gt;Text from Daisy

&gt;Says she'll be there this afternoon.

&gt;Works for me!  Gives us the chance to get our stuff in!

Sure enough, though he needed to go back to his dorm to get that taken care of first.

Hours pass by and the three of us with our helpers are getting everything set up.  We come to find out that Alex had more than just ""a few things for the living room"" like he told us.  He literally furnished the entire huge living space.  I asked him if he was a drug dealer on the side jokingly, but it would be tough to help him out in times of need.  He did the smart thing and deposited almost all of it, buying things as he needed them.  As an awesome guy, I had no doubt that his parents were awesome people too.

With his two jobs, even though she felt he went a bit overboard.  Our living room was now furnished with a huge LED television, beautiful glass entertainment center, gaming stuff, a gigantic couch, couple of recliners, and a coffee table and end tables.  He had kept the bulk of his stuff at his parents place and took the entertainment stuff with him.  I only bring this up because you can probably see impending disaster as I describe this stuff.  Keep your jimmies in tow

At about 2pm

&gt;Almost finished with my bedroom

&gt;So many more boxes to go

&gt;Damn do I need a shower

&gt;Mirror starts to shake on the door

&gt;Earthquake in the midwest?

&gt;Bed shifts over

&gt;Oh

Daisy came in at around 3pm that afternoon after the rest of us had gotten all of our stuff inside, though he didn't say much.  Her mother, however, talked almost exactly like Daisy did.

&gt;Head downstairs

&gt;Daisy and family are here

&gt;""ALLLLLEEEEXXXXX!!!  I MISSED YOU!!!""

&gt;Alex is laughing a bit

&gt;Oh god

&gt;Lamp shakes on endtable

&gt;Alex braces for impact

&gt;Daisy gives Alex a gigantic hug and big wet kiss

&gt;Poor guy

&gt;He may need mouthwash now

&gt;...what is mom holding?

Her mother was holding two gigantic white bags.  They were unmarked and I couldn't tell what was in them, the bellowing began from the mother....and holy shit, was it crazy.

&gt;""Oh so you work at a strip club?  I can see that!  You are good looking!""

&gt;Alex looks mortified.

&gt;""Oh

&gt;Momma whale looks disappointed

&gt;Doesn't seem to care

&gt;""Oh you should get up on stage yourself!  You could knock ladies like me dead and earn you some real money!""

&gt;Alex may drop dead right here

&gt;Don't want to replace awesome roommate

&gt;Please stop with this

Alex, saying he would see everyone tomorrow afternoon.  As he headed out the door, Daisy and her mother proved just how airheaded they really were.

&gt;""Tomorrow afternoon?  But he works tonight?""

&gt;Really Daisy?

&gt;""I know

&gt;.....

&gt;areyouserious.mp3

&gt;Father facepalms.

&gt;Looks like he understands it.

&gt;Dad has to explain

&gt;""He works third shift.  He'll get home late and sleep until the afternoon.""

&gt;Dark lightbulbs over their heads.

&gt;Oh look

&gt;valleygirls.org

&gt;""WELL CAN WE EAT NOW???  I'M SO HUNGRY!!""

&gt;Daisy obviously hasn't eaten enough

&gt;Mom quickly agrees.

&gt;They go to kitchen.

&gt;Father looks rather disgusted.

&gt;Seems like this is not rare behavior for them.

&gt;shocking.mp3

While I decided not to watch this destruction in the kitchen, and two two-liter bottles of diet coke.  This would be considered a small meal for both of them, I would realize.  Did I mention they had done not one bit of moving yet?  Daisy's dad is not happy with them immediately and starts moving some stuff in while they devour their food.  Daisy apparently didn't have too much stuff, mainly just for her bedroom and then, of course, food.

Lots

&gt;Decide to help out frustrated father

&gt;Valley girl and mom are too busy destroying their food

&gt;Alicia decides to help out as well.

&gt;Probably disgusted like I am

&gt;What have we done to ourselves?

&gt;All this stuff looks brand new...

&gt;Wonder if hamplanets will even help out with the moving?

&gt;LOLNOPE

Daisy's father, did all of their moving.  Her father talked a bit more after we started helping, explaining that things at her last place had gone really wrong.  According to him, she lived in one of the nicest dorms on campus with two other girls and none of them got along.  He didn't really elaborate because he said he traveled a lot for business (found out later he was an executive for a large telecommunications company, though we never asked which one just out of privacy) and that the mother dealt with all the problems herself.  Either way, he said he was hoping for a better outcome with this situation since it was a huge house and he was glad that we seemed to be decent people.  After moving all of the things into the house, including what had to be $500 in food

&gt;There is no room in the fridge and freezer for all of this

&gt;Why so much damned food?

&gt;Guess the fridge is kind of small

&gt;Just mine and Alicia's stuff.

&gt;What in the hell are we going to do&gt;

&gt;we're indoors...?

&gt;...dafuq are you two doing?

&gt;Also gam

&gt;Class is over!

Much bellowing occurred between the three of them, though, that the average-sized fridge and freezer was not going to cut it.

&gt;Get phone out

&gt;text Alex about problem with fridge and freezer space

&gt;responds with ""don't worry

&gt;Had no idea what he meant

&gt;Trust awesome roomie

&gt;Get out of way of hamplanet for time being.

Alex would save the day that weekend by buying an industrial sized freezer for the basement.  He said when he actually had the time, they get greedy.

Moving on from that sidenote, I was happy with my layout as well as Alicia.  We were so glad we got the house and figured that having the awesome place would offset the problems that would happen.

Again

We were going to cook but figured we could go out since Daisy and her parents were still around and we hadn't gone out to a restaurant in awhile.  We head downstairs, and tell them we'll be back and we're going out for awhile, making sure Daisy has her key for the place.

&gt;Can't wait to eat.

&gt;Restaurant just a couple blocks away is awesome

&gt;Can't wait until 21 and can get beer there as well

&gt;OH SNAP!

&gt;Dad just put his foot down!

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;Escape quickly out back

&gt;Hear bellowing in distance

&gt;Thanks higher deity that she can't run

&gt;Alicia laughing in car

&gt;Fuck you bitch

We took off and went to dinner, cool people.  This was our safehaven.  We were gone for about two hours and returned to what resembled destruction.

&gt;Awesome dinner

&gt;Open back door

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/5858-freak-out) I see ""dinner"" has been served

Daisy was in her bedroom and her parents were gone.  She had destroyed six frozen dinners already and had left the trash out on the table.  Alicia was getting angry but I sent her upstairs so I could try and be civil.

&gt;Seems oddly content

&gt;That poor bed looks unstable

&gt;""OF COURSE I WILL CASSIE!  I JUST NEEDED TO REST AFTER EATING!  I GET LIGHT HEADED!""

&gt;Says I must be lying because her sweet child could never do something like break someone else's things intentionally

&gt;Dad says he did hear something slam into the ground

&gt;Mother did too

&gt;So did uncle

&gt;Ursa Major having none of it

&gt;""Well then she should've just given it to Ursa Minor anyway! It doesn't matter!""

&gt;Still shrieking

&gt;""Then you should've listened to her.""

&gt;""IT WAS OVER $100

&gt;""No

&gt;Dad can't take it

&gt;""No
to break her things because she's physically bigger

&gt;""YOU'RE CALLING MY DAUGHTER A LIAR THEN.""

&gt;""You're calling my daughter

&gt;""SHE NEEDS TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL AND SHARE HER THINGS. Tell her to apologize for making Ursa Minor cry! See
throwing_pies isn't even crying! Only Ursa Minor is crying! If she were really upset

&gt;""*YOU BROKE HER MOST EXPENSIVE

&gt;Ursa Minor still crying

&gt;I have been incoherently screaming and hyperventilating trying to save my gameboy turning it on and off

&gt;it won't turn on it won't turn on it won't turn on

&gt;scream of child anguish

&gt;hurl gameboy at Ursa Minor

&gt;""YOU BROKE IT, YOU ALL THINK I'M LYING ANYWAY""

&gt;do their best at driving while consoling a hysteric

&gt;it eventually turned on but was glitchy as fuck and would turn off at random times

&gt;dad was very sorry but couldn't justify the expense of buying me an entirely new one

&gt;tells me to never bring anything valuable to me near her again

&gt;he tells mom that Ursa Minor/Major should be forced to pay for a new one for me

&gt;she agrees but hamplanets gon' hamplanet and they don't do it.

I'm currently 23.  I finished up college last year (hurray me!) with a degree in marketing.  I probably took the easy way out in school with that major, right?  

The story I'm about to share with you is a collection of the craziest shit that happened in the house that I lived with two people who are now a couple of my best friends....and our hamplanet in the story

I will apologize

I had spent two years on campus living in the dorms of the university, food, men, everything.  It worked out so well, and we wondered why so many people had issues with roommates while we rarely, if ever, had an issue.

Towards the end of our second year, figuring we knew enough people that we could scrounge up one or two roommates to fill in the extra spots.  After a couple of days with little luck, we found a place we both fell in love with.

We had found a recently renovated house about seven blocks from campus.  Everything had been redone and it was amazingly huge.  The living space was gigantic, and there were four bedrooms:  Two downstairs and two upstairs.  The cost was a little high, but with two more roommates, we could make it work.  Alicia and I had fallen in love and were already picturing decorating it.  Alicia had extra money from her work and was able to cover the difference for the security deposit.  

But

Thankfully

Alex was a great guy.  Tall, so he said that he was pretty easy to deal with because he was almost never home.  We hit it off with him and he agreed to join in with us, especially after we showed him the place.  He, too, fell in love with the house and was just as excited as we were.

That left one more spot.

We spent a week talking with people we knew

We received one response:  That came from our hamplanet

Daisy seemed nice enough when talking online.  She said she had some roommate issues the previous year because they didn't respect her privacy (We found out that would be a lie later on, we agreed to meet up with her at the student union on campus.  Alex could only stay for a little bit because of his insane schedule, but we found a time that worked.

Me

And waited.

And waited.

Alex couldn't wait any longer and said he had to get going or he was going to be late for class and then had to work immediately after.  We said we would text him when she showed up.

About five minutes after Alex left, waddled in.

To put this in perspective, so we were around 120-125.  Daisy was the same height as us, yet was over 300 pounds.  I felt so bad for the chair that she sat on.

""Are you guys Alicia and Cassie?""  Daisy said, but didn't bother asking.

We chatted it up for about twenty minutes and there were no real red flags at the time

*""Oooooo we're going to have a guy live with us?  Is he hot?  I have such a hard time keeping guys off of me because they want my curves so bad!""*

Gag unto me with a spoon, but that wasn't important for the conversation.

Alicia decided to take over the conversation since I was having issues keeping my recent lunch in my stomach.

""Yes

Daisy didn't hear the important part and re-iterated what she wanted to know.

*""But is he hot?  I don't know if I can live with a hot guy because he might just live in my room instead tee-hee""*

That was the first time I heard her laugh

""Yes

To be honest

*""Oh!  Yes I have the money!""*

That helped things out, but I wanted to make sure Alicia got her money back as soon as possible.  Alex managed to give her the money after our first meeting right at an ATM.

*""Hi Mommy!  Yes I'm sitting here with my new roommates and I just need X dollars from you for the security deposit! ......But I spent that money already!  I told you I was robbed!""*

The red flag went right over my head as I was trying to tune out her somewhat annoying tone.

*""THANK YOU MOMMY!  I SWEAR I'LL DO BETTER!""*

We texted Alex to tell him that we were bringing her in with some warning that she was a little loud.  Alex didn't care and said as long as she pays rent, as we all did.  We agreed that we would take care of the lease tomorrow.

The money was wired to her the next day and we arranged to all head to the realty place to sign the lease.  Alex was running just a little late from class, was running late and we didn't hear from her.  We had texted Alex after our meetup and explained who was living with us.  Alex seemed to attribute it to nerves because he said he was even nervous meeting with two people he didn't know, so we all shrugged it off.

Alicia and I were at the realtor's office at the agreed time.  Alex showed up about ten minutes after that....with Daisy right behind him

*""Oh my god I can't believe I'm going to be living with you!  You are so hot!  We are going to get to be so close

Alex just laughed and smiled, they allowed people to move in a couple of weeks sooner if they paid the first month's rent well before move in day.  Alicia had a little money and I was somewhat broke.  Daisy had trouble just getting her mother to send her money, so she was out.  Alex then surprised us by saying he would cover the first month on his own and that the rest of us could pay him back at any time until our lease actually started.  We said we had no problem and he wrote the check to the realtor.  They said we could pick up the keys on July 15th and that was it!

Our first signs of trouble with Daisy started not long after we signed the lease.  

They had given us the keys to go looking through the house and to pick bedrooms.  Daisy, but in retrospect, this was nothing compared to the upcoming disaster that was living with her.  None of us said nothing, but we were all thinking that she probably ate too much and she shouldn't be bringing food and drink into our brand new place before we even moved in.

We split up and started looking at the place up and down, which the smallest one was still pretty large.  Daisy didn't say a word until she found out which bedroom Alex wanted, which was one of the bedrooms downstairs, before she decided she wanted the one across from him.

*""Oh Alex and I have to be on the same floor together because we are going to be so close so we might as well be right near each other!""*

I have to give credit to Alex.  He knew what she was insinuating and he took it all in stride.  It worked out, there was no way any of us pictured our new hamplanet of a roommate to waddle up the steps.  She was winded just going up the front three to get into the house!

After this, though she did have a point:  That refrigerator was damned small for four people.  I then watched as Daisy set her trash from McDonalds on the counter and just wandered off.

""Daisy

*""I'm done with it

""We haven't even moved in yet!  They still have to paint this place and I don't want them thinking we don't care about the place before we move in!""

Scoffing rather loudly

*""Well

I didn't think I would ever meet a fat valley girl.  I was wrong.  She was worse than any valley girl I had ever met.  Still

Alex came upstairs again

""What's up?""

*""ALLLLEEEXXXX

Alex raised an eyebrow, Daisy took that as him liking her.

*""See

I'm 5'4, thank you.  I'm also not a heartless bitch and like doing things for myself.

A little angered

""Alicia

She looked at me a bit odd and shrugged.

""I hope not

""Yeah


We were so wrong, especially after school finished up.

That will be all for this installment

At 16 I was finally able to get a job and start making me some monies. Applied at a few local places and ended up taking a job at Fat Krispy Chicken (FKC). For the few weeks there were no issues. I was a computer nerd already

My manager was a 25 year-old bitch

In my third week I'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in... a very large couple. 350lb+ each. The man wheezes up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes. I'm thinking this is a big order

I ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells: ""I'm eating too!"" ... wut? She orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies. Seriously. She then follows that up with ""And I need a large diet Coke."" at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet Coke as well.

I'm laughing internally at this point

Their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food... to the dine-in tables.

Me: I'm sorry folks

Man: Don't need trays. We always order take-out because I'm not paying tax to eat here!

Cheap fucks. They just spent nearly $40 on food but can't pay the tax? Eh. Whatever. I go about my day and start cleaning the lobby. I'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up. I figured something must be wrong so I look to see and.... the food's all gone. In roughly 7 minutes. Nearly 17, and potatoes.

Stunned silence. I'm staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out.

Woman notices me staring and and gets pissed. Calls for manager. Manager comes up and listens to how badly I treated them by acting like she wouldn't be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy (wut?) meal.

She told me in front of the customers that I had two choices. 1. Apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or 2. Termination. Fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself.

I laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry slob like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a blessing. Took my apron off and put it on the counter

Still one of my best retail/food memories.

Wherein I prank Ginger

About two weeks pass without any major incident between Ginger and Eric. To this day, and Cheryl. But whatever he said, it made the Post-its, the flirting, and Ginger prancing around Eric in a mini-skirt stop... for a while, at least.

It was around the end of September by then, which kind of made it worse. So Yuri and I decided to come up with an early birthday present for him.

Ginger fact: She does not drink anything but pop. Not even juice. Ginger's favorite is Dr. Pepper. Yuri has the brilliant idea of replacing the Dr. Pepper with prune juice. It works, starts gagging, and spits prune juice all over the carpet. She guesses, correctly, that Yuri and I did it. But mostly that I did it. Because I was so jealous of her because she was ""popular and beautiful and she doesn't have to starve herself to make people like her.""

Ginger's been enjoying her freedom from her parents. She's bought a new wardrobe (push-up bras, started going out to clubs, learned to drive, and has actually made a bunch of friends at school so suddenly she thinks she's hot stuff. Ginger still calls Mama and Daddy when her roommates are being mean to her, but aside from reciting some snippets of religious hypocrisy she's cooled. Just like a dormant volcano. And boy, did it erupt.

So, Yuri and his boyfriend Scott, me and my boyfriend Luke, and fucking Ginger. Ginger gives Eric an iPod touch for his birthday. Eric grew up very poor, he's not used to expensive presents, and he's delighted by the gift. In return for her generosity Eric decides to invite her to dinner. Keep in mind that it was Cheryl that was supposed to go in Ginger's place. Ginger thinks this is finally her chance to get with Eric. And to get back at me.

I should mention that Luke and I were not doing so great at the time. We didn't break off permanently yet, we were doing okay. By the end of the night, though...

Like I mentioned before it was a nice restaurants, she wasn't being as loud as her usual self so we didn't bring up how horrible she looked.

We get to the restaurant- we agreed that we'd all pay for ourselves separately except for Eric, I leave to use the restroom. When I get back, that's when I notice something's different in the air. Luke, Eric, and Yuri looked pissed. Ginger looked at me so smugly and I got worried. Luke was ice cold. We have to wait for Ginger to finish her desserts- she ordered more than one, of course, and we all leave separately. Outside in the parking lot

I'd ridden with Luke on the way to the restaurant, and Scott. They tell me what happened while I was in the restroom. Supposedly, Ginger was upset to notice that Eric was checking me out as I was walking away (Eric denied this) and let it slip to Luke that I was crashing in Eric's room whenever Scott stayed over. She neglected to mention that I was sleeping on the floor and Eric was on the bed. Luke, Yuri says, went deathly quiet. Yuri tried to explain that Ginger was usually in the living room until 2am most nights and I was in a sleeping bag, but Luke wouldn't listen. He wouldn't talk to me for days.

I was shaking with anger by this point. When Ginger got home, you deluded fucking bitch!""- Me. That got her to admit it, and she said that I deserved it for being such an attention-seeking whore. ""You know that I'd bought a new dress just for Eric's birthday and you had to show me up!"" she yelled at me. I'm not proud of this, but I started grabbing the stuff on her table, make-up and DVDs and mangas, and started throwing them at the wall behind her. Ginger started screeching in terror and saying she was going to call the police on me for trying to kill her. The boys forced us apart and convinced me to sleep it off, but only after I cried about Luke for an hour.

We woke up two hours later to the sounds of Eric screaming at Ginger. Yuri and I run to his room, saying ""I have a second birthday present for you."" Eric turned on his desk lamp, saw Ginger in her lingerie, and freaked out. He screamed at her to get out of his room, and she started crying from rejection. I was already too exhausted to have another match with Ginger, so we all just went back to sleep on the lullaby of Ginger's sobs. The next morning, Eric gave Ginger back the Ipod touch and said, thank you."" Then he went and bought a lock for his door.

Alright

*** 

Last week Eventual Planet realized that summer is near and that means summer clothing. Upon trying on summer clothes I think she realized how much she's actually gained and came to me upset about how ""ugly"" she looks. 

I actually felt really really bad for her and offered to help her out with health (for the millionth time

""No, whatever.

A couple of days go by. 

Some days I take Tiny Roommate along for a 3k loop of my run because she's trying to get into running. As the two of us were getting back from one such run we find Eventual Planet in the living room in workout gear

""I'm going on a run!"" 

Awesome! I am so happy for her, and 5k routes depending on how far she wants to go. She takes off. 

15 minutes later she's back. I'm a little confused but whatever

""Man

... I can barely do 3k (1.8 miles) in 15 minutes. And I run a lot. I ask her if she's sure that's the loop she did and she said ""yep! But I had to walk a bunch

""Eventual Planet

""15 minutes! I did at least half an hour!"" 

... no. Okay. Whatever. 

Next day rolls around. She's actually going out again! YEAH! Beforehand she asks me about healthy workouts and healthy eating, and slow buildups. I offer to get her started and to let her borrow my P90X dvds. I offer to help her go food shopping, she actually agrees. I tell her about baby steps and cheat days. Finally, as she's ready to leave, I give her the route directions again just to be sure she knows where she's going distance-wise, and suddenly she brushes me off and leaves. 20 minutes later, this time

What? No. *My* 5k time

""Maybe I'm just really good at running, sorry for helping. Didn't realize anyone could pull off a 20 minute 5k after not once running for over a year. 

That night

""Eventual Planet

""Oh but I've done so well working out and you did say you need to take cheat days!"" 

""Not on day one of your diet!""

Cheese sauce ~250cal

Butter

French fries

Ice cream

~1380 calories. You did not ""run"" off 1380 calories in 20 minutes.

""OP, calm down."" 

Alright, it is just one meal.

Next morning. 

3-egg omelette with cheese (and veggies, 2 pieces of white toast with butter, all fried in grease or butter, with large Starbucks frap with whipped cream. 

""Eventual Planet

""It's healthy because it's well-rounded and has veggies!"" 

Give her another health food speech to try and convince her otherwise. She gets angry and storms off

Okay, ~8 weeks, ~16lbs. 

""But OP

... I explain why 2lbs a week is a pretty good goal and leave it at that when she gets really angry/starts raising her voice again. 

Lunch time! 

Grilled cheese sandwich. White bread

I look down at my huge bowl of salad

Next day, come back for TR, and do a 3k run with her. I come around and we take off, and after about 2 blocks we have to stop and take a walking break... because Eventual Planet. 

By the time we've done 2k

""You can't just go stupidly fast when you have a new runner with you! I know you run a lot but taking off like that was just rude! You told me you'd take it easy! I'm trying to get in shape

... we ran at maybe 4.5mph

So anyways, nuts and berries added in) to give her an idea of a healthy lunch, and she actually took it and used it as a side dish. She took a full meal salad and ate it with a chicken burger with cheese and bacon on a white bread bun. She's been bitchy and nasty to me for a week straight, and has even gone so far as to say she can't help out with housework because she's ""too sore from working out."" I shit you not. She hasn't even done anything other than the three runs.

She's just impossible to deal with right now, if I just ignore her bitching, she actually starts crying and yelling about how no one cares that she's unhappy. I have taken to working in the back yard where she can't find me. 

Because she's not fucking leaving the house. 

I don't think she's gonna make it.

**TL;DR**: Roommate finally realizes how much weight she's gained

**bonus**

She walks in on me making lunch/typing out this story (activate ninja window-switching)

I tell her if she downs some water and goes for a run she'll feel way better. She glares at me and comes back with

So I was in America on vacation at some fairly large amusement park

&gt;ME: What the fuck is she doing with our nuts?!

My brother responds with

&gt;BROTHER: I was eating and she came up and just grabbed them and starting munching them down!

Now this is word for word as I can remember it I'm coming out of the store about 5 meters from my brother and her I yell

&gt;ME: OI! What the fuck are you doing you cunt!?

Her response and taken aback at the harsh word

&gt;FEMALE SUN: I needed a snack

I responded with 

&gt;ME: Listen to me you fat disgusting cunt! You can't just grab stuff

She was astonished and angry that I talked to her that way. At the same time her husband rolled around on a scooter screaming

&gt;MALE SUN: You cant talk to my wife that way! Apologize now!

She nodding in agreement

&gt;MALE SUN: Apologize or I'll call the cops on you!

I literally couldn't believe that they could be so stupid as to think that would work

&gt;ME: The cops won't do shit retard

&gt;MALE SUN: She needed that for her blood sugar

She tries to give her husband the bag of nuts

She yells

&gt;FEMALE SUN: HEY!

At this point several people had stopped what they were doing and just watching

&gt;ME: Are you fucking stupid? That's not how laws work. Your disgusting fat piece of shit wife stole our snack

&gt;MALE SUN: NO!

A security guard comes along to see what the yelling is about

&gt;MALE SUN: My wife was eating *our* snack and these two came up and started yelling

His wife chimes in

&gt;FEMALE SUN: He was fat-shaming me, I can't help that I'm big boned and have TWO! Diseases!

She actually literally truthfully said that. The guard asks if this was true

&gt;ME: No

He gets this look on his face

&gt;ME: They need to pay for our nuts, that's why I threw them away!

The guard agrees

The male sun says.

&gt;MALE SUN: We're not paying for that!

The guard says if you are not paying for it

&gt;ME: Pathetic that you let yourself get that fat

I just turn around and walk off

&gt;FEMALE SUN: You can't do this! This is discrimination against bigger people

And

&gt;MALE SUN: We just got here

I get a smile on my face and turn around to see her getting on a scooter as well. Amazed she could stand that long with her condition.

I think it was pretty unfair of me to give FPS such a great fourth chapter and then leave you all on a cliffhanger, FPS.  You are about to find out.

Alicia and I finally turned 21 and it was time to celebrate.  Thankfully, Alex going alpha on her had scared her, at least for a bit.  It wasn't long before she acted like the entire thing hadn't happened.

Now that the three of us were all of age, just one day removed from Alicia becoming 21 but we were all in the middle of some projects for our classes and opted to wait until the weekend.  Alex took a day off from the strip club to take us bar hopping since we had a few in our immediate area and would not need a DD.  It was early Saturday evening and we were about to get ready.  Daisy had decided not to go home that weekend, much to our surprise, and that would end up being a very bad thing.  Green text, activate!

&gt;Alex going through the plan of attack

&gt;Several great places to go to!

&gt;floor starts to shake

&gt;xbox controller rattling on coffee table

&gt;maybe Daisy is just getting food

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;Getting louder and closer!

&gt;A wild hamplanet appears!

&gt;Blubbering has already started

&gt;""OH MY GOD WHY ARE YOU GUYS GOING OUT TO THE BARS!?!  I CAN'T GO TO THEM YET!""

&gt;that's the point...

&gt;too beta to say that

&gt;Alex shakes his head

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;Sense:  Alex makes it!

&gt;MOAR BLUBBERING THOUGH!

&gt;""BUT I WANT TO COME OUT FOR A ROOMIE NIGHT!!!  IT'S NOT FAIR!!!""

&gt;footstomp.gif

&gt;[Thoughts going through my head](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/4228-upset.gif)

&gt;Did she literally just do a 12-year-old tantrum?

&gt;Alex sighs

&gt;""Daisy

Daisy starts to cry like crazy at that point, especially since he never got an apology from her, but at least got the money.  This time, though, she was ramping up her blubbering to an entirely new level.

&gt;""DAMMIT I WANT TO GO!  I'LL JUST HAVE SOMEONE SNEAK ME IN!""

&gt;sigh.gif

&gt;Alicia gets a little alpha

&gt;""No you won't

Daisy had caught on with a group of people who had a club that were into board games like Dungeons and Dragons.  She was coming home later from classes

&gt;""BUT I WANT TO GO TO THE BAR!""

&gt;getting irritated

&gt;We are not babysitters

&gt;Ignore mode

Daisy eventually waddled off to her room when she realized she wasn't going to get her wish.  A little bit after that, this got the attention of the beluga when we assembled for the night out.

&gt;back in living room

&gt;Alicia and I looking hot!

&gt;Alex joins us

&gt;""You girls ready?""

&gt;floor shakes again

&gt;god dammit...

Daisy comes around the corner in an entirely different mood

&gt;""ALLEXXX YOU LOOK HOT!""

&gt;Alex gets his hand up before the charging even starts

&gt;""Thanks

&gt;Nicer than I would have been

&gt;At least he didn't get trampled

&gt;""GUYS SINCE YOU ARE LIKE GOING OUT TONIGHT

&gt;shrug

&gt;Sounds safe enough

&gt;Alex nods to us

&gt;""Sure

&gt;Daisy looks happy

&gt;No bellowing necessary

&gt;""OKAY!  NIGHT GUIZ!""

&gt;That seemed....painless

The three of us head out for the night while Daisy ran off to her room to do....whatever she needed to in order to get ready.  Our thoughts were not on her having her friends over.  We were going out to have a good time.  Alicia and I found that being newly 21 and dressed to kill netted us bar tabs of exactly zero dollars, but we ended up pretty drunk quickly, not even making it to Midnight and only to two bars after going out at around 9pm.  We ended up getting a bite to eat on the way back to the house, fully content with how the night went.  Alicia ended up with a couple of phones numbers, as did I.  Alex got hit on and got numbers as well, but it ended up being moot for him (He would end up dating a waitress at the strip club not long after this, more on that to come later).

When we got back to the house

The living room looked like Fat Man AND Little Boy had exploded in it.  Pizza boxes, board games, it was just terrible.  However, there was no Daisy or said friends she mentioned to be found.  Worse yet, the front door was unlocked.  Alex and Alicia surveyed the damage and, thankfully, it was just trash everywhere in the living room and nothing of his was broken.  That was when we heard shit happening out back.  Whatever it was

&gt;dafuq is going on out back?

&gt;*CLANG*....*CLANG*....*CLANG*

&gt;is someone breaking something?

&gt;Sounds like metal hitting together

I head out back to find Daisy and an entire galactic system of hamplanets out back, but it wasn't so much as grass as it was a place to park cars, though there was only room for two to fit comfortably.  Mine and Alex's cars were back there, and these two idiots were swinging these long pipes at each other along side of Alex's car.  Daisy was sitting on the steps of the small patio we had out back, laughing at these two guys.

&gt;Pretty mad about the living room

&gt;Tap Daisy on shoulder

&gt;""OH HAI CASSIE!  I FIGURED YOU'D BE GONE LONGER GETTING DRUNK AND SLUTTY!""

&gt;Bitch

&gt;Still kinda drunk

&gt;""You need to clean up the living room.  It's a mess.""

&gt;Not really alpha...or beta...

&gt;Okay

&gt;Alex coming up behind me

&gt;Clanging still going on while the others watch

&gt;""OH MY GOD I WILL GET TO IT WHEN THEY LEAVE!  WE DON'T NEED TO DRINK TO HAVE A GOOD TIME

&gt;[My reaction to anti-drinking PSA from hamplanet](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/5907-barney-kill-me-now.gif)

&gt;Alex looking at idiots

&gt;""Tell them to get away from my car doing that

&gt;Daisy too busy laughing at her statement to me to hear

&gt;*CLANG* *CLANG* *CRASH*

&gt;......

It was like terrible foreshadowing on Alex's part.  Luke Hamwalker decided to jump back from a side swipe from Darth Beluga instead of blocking it as they had been.  The result?  Darth Beluga's ""lightsaber"" smashes Alex's window.  Everyone freezes.  Alex hits nuclear level explosion.

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;[Alex's reaction](http://24.media.tumblr.com/771567b9ef0a0b5bf203eb5f6893dfbb/tumblr_mpjz7vUQDF1s14cmno1_500.gif)

&gt;Darth Beluga is going to die

Alex storms down the steps and immediately begins yelling at these two asshats.  The rest of the galaxy runs back into the house, and screaming at him.  The kid apologized profusely, realizing he was possibly about to get murdered.  Alex didn't swing, but he calmed down quite a bit when the guy said he would pay for the window (Well...fucking DUH!) over and over again.  SOMEHOW, out of all of this, Daisy uses fatlogic to start screaming at Alex.

&gt;""OMG ALEX DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE AND HURT MAH FRIEND!  HE CAN'T HANDLE THIS BECAUSE OF HIS CUNDISHUN!""

&gt;....

&gt;[ofw](http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/misc-are-you-fucking-kidding-me-l.png) Daisy says that

&gt;Alex might kill both of them

&gt;Turns back to the guy

&gt;Running down to stop him from committing murder

I managed to get him to let go of the guy, just to get it out of the way now, he did pay Alex.  It wasn't cheap, but he had the money not long after the repairs. 

After that was settled, even after all of the shit that occurred, but they weren't about to face Alex's wrath if anything else went wrong.  Daisy turned this around using FATLOGIC!

&gt;What a mess

&gt;Alex's car damaged...living room a mess

&gt;Bellowing can be heard

&gt;Not now...

&gt;""OMG YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING DICKS!  I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER!  YOU SAID I COULD!""

&gt;Alex not in the mood

&gt;Looks absolutely exhausted from the entire thing

&gt;Be alpha

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;MOAR BELLOWING!

&gt;""OMG JUST BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS WITHOUT GETTING DRUNK DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE JEALOUS OF ME!""

&gt;....did that make any sense?

&gt;[mfw](http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/6092-wahwaah-.gif) that attempts to register.

&gt;Alex comes walking back in

&gt;Glass of whiskey in one hand

&gt;Trash bag in the other

&gt;Looks somewhat calm.

&gt;Alpha Alex

&gt;""Daisy

&gt;THE WALRUS IS NOT DONE!

&gt;""FUCK YOU GUYS I'M GOING WITH MY FRIENDS!""

&gt;omg stampede!

&gt;~~runs~~ waddles out of front door

Blubbering as she ran out the door, oblivious to what had been going on.  Alex sighed and shook his head, putting his glass down and just idly picking up the trash.  I helped him out, knowing that it would never get done if we didn't.  It didn't take us too terribly long to get it organized, but that wasn't the point, obviously.  When we were done cleaning, Alex and I sat on the couch and opted for a movie until passing out.

**TL;DR - HURRAY TURNING 21!!  Night goes so well....until Daisy's friends smash out a window in Alex's car.  Alex goes alpha again.  Daisy uses fatlogic and blubbers away from cleaning!**

1372638358.0,1he8ax,"Maggie, My Ham Housemate: The Beginning",WakeUpMaggie_FPS,931,258,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1he8ax/maggie_my_ham_housemate_the_beginning/

I'm from the Northwest, but all reasonable and nice.I made the decision to stay in the town I went to school in after i graduated, to work and study for the exam I needed for grad school. I had three friends who were also staying in the area: John, my best friend since 4th grade who moved out to NY with me, Sasha, my freshman year roommate and her boyfriend of two years, Andrew. At the beginning of this story, and Andrew is 6'0

Before we even graduated, so this, if anything, was a bonus exercise opportunity. The only issue was we needed another roommate. So I wrote out a flyer. The only real requirements I put on there were 1. MUST be able to pay ""x"" amount of money for rent/utilities, and 2. no cigarette smokers (the lease prohibited it). 
	
I get a call from some chick named Maggie, and just invited her for a coffee so we could talk. We said 10:30 am (her suggestion), and she walked into the student lounge around 12 pm. Obviously the girl had JUST woken up. She was about 5'10, and I would say around 300lbs. Dirty college sweatshirt, pajama bottoms, and hair dyed almost blue-black, tied up in what I assume was supposed to be a ponytail, even though every fiber of my lacrosse playing body told me not too. She plopped down on the seat next to me
	
Our conversation was super normal: she told me she was a non-smoking, which did not fly with me *at all*. I basically pinned her down with my eyes and asked her how she was going to pay for the apartment, and she admitted ""Mommy's going to help me out with rent for a couple months"". I understood how that would be kind of embarrassing to admit to, but that was alright once she told me she had job plans for afterwards. She sounded well-read, generally polite, and I didn't really care how big she was, as long as she paid. The only other off thing about her was the fact that when I asked her if the distance from the town was a problem, I can manage it"". She laughed it off as soon as I did a double take. 
	
We kept in contact by text, and after graduation, we had about two days to move stuff in. Everyone but Maggie moved in on the first day, and settled bedrooms. Maggie was ""super busy"" and I called her to tell her that her room was smaller, but had its own bathroom. She said she was fine with it if we helped her bring her stuff over. On the last possible day she could stay at the dorms, she texted me that she was ready to move her stuff. Me and John hop in his truck, get down there, she hadn't packed anything. After I introduced John

""Oh I thought you guys could help me do that

""…. Okay…"" We toss her stuff into boxes, I mean, this girl has never thrown away a book in her life. It was actually kind of impressive. We have to make two trips to get her shit up to the house; she has even more clothes than books. John said ""at least we know Mommy has enough money to buy her shit tons of sweatshirts"". I counted about 25. When we finally get her into the car (on our third trip back), she sits in the front seat without a moments hesitation. I throw her last box of books into the hatch, and at this point, it's already 4pm, and I'm too exhausted to fight for stupid things like the front seat. John drops us off and unloads the boxes onto the street, and I turn off my phone and start pouring drinks. When I get off my shit

I was really, because, *of course* it was. As soon as I got in the truck, John started listing Maggie's crimes. She had tried to get all three of them to move the boxes upstairs for her while she was on the phone with her mom. They brought up at least two boxes each before they realized she was sitting on the couch, eating Andrew's chips, telling her mom she was finished moving in. What. John slammed down a box right then and there and told her he wasn't moving another box until she did her share. Maggie went wide-eyed and hung up the phone. She looked incredibly offended, and stalked downstairs to grab a box. Andrew picked up his bag of chips to find crumbs. 

After they had helped her move fifteen boxes of stuff (of which she moved two) upstairs, you really have to pay it back as soon as possible. Maggie orders two large servings of beef dishes, extra white rice, and two egg rolls.

 Wait, you said this girl was a vegetarian!?! After John raised this concern with her (""You know Beef with Broccoli has... beef in it?""), she said ""Oh, yeah. I'm not *really* vegetarian. That's just something I identify with. I cave so often though. I need the protein."" 

WAT. She's then short $20 on her side of the bill. Everyone else had gotten one dish, but Maggie didn't know that. After they ate, and she left her empty dishes out on the table (I guess ""clean freak"" is also something she just identifies with), she went up to Johns room, and asked if she could talk to him. He thought she was having issues with the house or something, so he said sure.

She then sat on his bed and lectured him like a five year old. About how he treated her like a common criminal just because she was 20 short (after we explained the food policy). Then she starts accusing him of buying ME food just because he wanted to sleep with me, please! I'll pay you back in the morning"". Yeah okay. 

This was just the first day. 

Sorry

My mom goes on to say how most of these stories are probably made up for points

My mom and dad were extremely fit and healthy people in their youth

One day they went to the Chinese food buffet later in the evening so there was only one other family there. The other family was a group of four, Teenage Daughter, and Teenage Son, all of whom were exceptionally obese. No weight estimates, but my mom said the four people took up a booth that was made for 8. 

As my parents were sitting down, and TS had only a small heaping plate, because that's all that was left, according to my dad. 

My parents went up to the buffet and saw that there were no ribs left and notified the staff (a Chinese lady), and retreated into the kitchen for more ribs.

My parents made the mistake of going back to their table. The fat family continued to make frequent trips up to the buffet counter

The Chinese lady brought out some more ribs and no sooner had the ribs hit the table

[HFW](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18j2bwor6ki2ggif/ku-medium.gif) BD had taken ALL of the ribs. 

My dad went up to the Chinese lady to tell her that

She walked right up to the fat family and started yelling with in a thick Chinese accent

The Chinese lady then apologized to my dad and delivered some ribs directly to my parents' table. She wasn't taking any chances. As soon as my parents finished eating and paid

So whenever the police are called, AKA Case Reports, are when enough shit has gone down to require the need for a documented report of the incident, like vehicle theft, assault, etc.

One fine morning a LardTard wobbled into the lobby. It was a Thursday, a line of people had already formed behind him like a clogged artery. I can tell by the look in his opposite-facing eyes that this is not going to be an easy time for me. I subtly make sure the bullet-proof glass barrier is locked.

""I need uh copy of a police report

Okay, and he shakes his chins vehemently, insisting he needs a poLEESE rePORT. Still, no big deal. I ask him if he has a case report number for it, and he shakes his chins again. He's getting even more agitated than when he was when he came in, and the line is increasing behind him.

All right, and he stares at me blankly. At least I think he was staring at me. Dat lazy eye.

I ask him for the date, glaring in at me and trying to look at my computer screen. The uncomfortable seconds tick by and the people behind him are trying to see past him to figure out what the hold-up is. My co-workers are too preoccupied with checking Facebook to help me out.

I find a Code One for the info he gave me- a Cit Ass (lol), and like so many of these people do, decide to give me their life stories when all I need is a simple answer from them.

Sir LardTard was dining at aforementioned McDonald's on the infamous date he provided. Like I said

When he finished wheezing through his story I read the Code One. It only had two brief sentences about LardTard getting stuck and refusing medical attention. I apologize to LardTard that no case report was actually made about the incident despite his demands and I can't legally give out copies of Code Ones without approval from the legal department. I offer for him to fill out a public records access request but he'd rather yell at me instead. He starts to dive into his story again but I go alpha and cut him off telling him there's nothing else I can do for him. 

He mumbles something about suing the city and waddles off into the sunset. ",self,t5_2vzax,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1k7y7m/somebody_call_911_fattys_cryin_murder_on_the/

FPS, indeed, human.  Let me tell you a bit more about Alex before getting into this chapter.

As I've said before, he usually spent it with Alicia and I watching TV, gaming, having a couple of drinks, or with a few of his friends from his previous years of school.  Every couple of months, he would decide he just needed a break from everything and tell both of his jobs that he needed to catch up on school for a few days.  Both employers were cool enough to let this happen, and he would regain his bearings.  For the first few weeks, even the restaurant incident

Today I give you the first showing that Alex is truly human...and very VERY Alpha when he needed to be.  The incident takes place a couple of weeks into the Fall Semester.  I will apologize for lack of green text in this

I mentioned in our second chapter that Alex had bought a freezer for the basement.  You know the ones I'm talking about:  flip up top, still would waddle her ballooned ass downstairs to the freezer to use some space there.

Our school had a decent football team and Alex loved cooking stuff up for games, he would transfer his frozen meat to the fridge so it could thaw and was ready the next day.  The first time he did this, Daisy didn't seem to understand the concept since she only cooked frozen, microwavable foods.  He actually had to explain to her that you can't just throw frozen ribs onto a grill and cook them.  It had to be thawed out properly and that there were a couple different ways to do it, but this was the best way since it only took a day and still kept the meat properly stored.

Daisy usually went home for the weekends immediately after class was over on Friday, an odor coming from her room which really was a drag on Alex since his room was across from hers.

Alpha Alex emerged when Daisy's grocery shopping got completely out of control.  Daisy would make two trips a week to the grocery store and basically clean out the frozen foods section.  I'm sure the stockers in that store quaked with fear when they saw/heard/felt her coming into the store.  Much bellowing would occur when the freezer would already be semi-full of her stuff and have a couple of things from the rest of us, and store the rest down there, which she had a tendency to forget about and would just go shopping more instead of making the trip down the stairs to transfer food to feed her beetus upstairs.  Oh, and obviously, Alex's ribs and steaks were down there.  

You can see where this is going

Friday rolls around in this week

&gt;be me

&gt;playing Zelda:LTTP on Wii Classic Console.  Fuck yeah

&gt;Fuck you

&gt;Alex stumbles into living room

&gt;Looks dead to the world

&gt;""Zelda

&gt;I nod

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;Alex doesn't sit down

&gt;""be prepared for karting in a bit.""

&gt;I laugh

&gt;""Bring it!""

&gt;Alex leaves

&gt;Damn you

&gt;""CASSIE!!!!""

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;*pause that shit*

&gt;""ALEX?""

&gt;Something's not right.

I get up and head downstairs into the basement

&gt;Oh fuck

&gt;That's a lot of meat

&gt;Look in freezer

&gt;Stockpiled with frozen dinners.

&gt;Alex looks really pissed

&gt;calms down a bit

&gt;""I'm going to guess these aren't yours or Alicia's

&gt;I shake my head.

&gt;Can't even that frozen shit

&gt;""Only one person here that eats frozen dinners all the time.""

&gt;Alex nods

I did him the favor of at least getting the garbage bag so he could clean it up.  He didn't say anything beyond that

Sure enough, but Alex wasn't about to let her get to her bedroom before he had his moment.

&gt;""Daisy!  Hold up!""

&gt;stomping getting closer

&gt;Daisy comes into view

&gt;""Yesssss Alllleeexxx?  Do you want to come home with me for the 
weekend?""

&gt;gag.gif

&gt;Alex shakes his head

&gt;""Did you stock the freezer downstairs with your food?""

&gt;Daisy seems confused.

&gt;""Well

&gt;fucking valley girl...

&gt;Hooo boy...

&gt;Alpha Alex is coming out to play!

&gt;""Not spoil?  Then why in the fuck did you just leave my meat out to do just that!?!""

&gt;Wow.

&gt;Didn't realize he was capable of yelling

&gt;popcorn.gif

&gt;""WELL YOU SAID THAT YOU NEEDED TO THAW YOUR FOOD OUT SO I FIGURED I WAS HELPING!  TEEHEE""

&gt;Can see Alex's fist clenching

&gt;Not stopping him this time

&gt;He has every right to be pissed

&gt;""....when did you take them out!?!""

&gt;Daisy doesn't seem to understand that he might kill her

&gt;""Oh

&gt;holy shit

&gt;Three days

&gt;""DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE JUST WASTED CLOSE TO $100 OF MY FOOD!?!  YOU CAN'T LEAVE THAT SHIT OUT FOR THREE DAYS!""

&gt;Not quite nuclear...but Alpha as fuck!

&gt;Daisy is quivering

&gt;Blubbering about to commence

&gt;""I SWEAR I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING I JUST HAVE TO HAVE ALL THIS FOOD READY BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP IT BECAUSE OF MY CUNDISHUN!""

&gt;I have to step in.

&gt;fuckingridiculous.mp3

&gt;""What fucking condition is that

&gt;Alex doesn't budge

&gt;Waiting for answer

&gt;Tears coming down Daisy's face

&gt;""YOU GUYS JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THAT I WAS TRYING TO HELP AND DO YOU A FAVOR BUT YOU JUST WANT TO BE ASSHOLES!""

&gt;sidestep.gif

&gt;wtf.org

&gt;Alex approaching nuclear levels

&gt;""I will make this perfectly clear to you:  You will pay me back for the food that has spoiled.  You will also get me the money you still owe me from fronting the cash for our first month so we could move in early.  You will also never move my things in the fridge or freezer again.  GET IT?""

&gt;Oh shi-

&gt;She still hasn't paid him?

&gt;DAFUQ?

At this point

&gt;""She still hasn't paid you for that?""

&gt;Alex shook his head

&gt;Calming down

&gt;""I asked her about it the day after we moved in.  She said she needed some time for it and I said no problem.  Gave her the benefit of the doubt.""

&gt;Obviously she didn't care.

&gt;Learning that Daisy only cares about herself.

&gt;Shocking.

I was definitely glad to see that Alex had a breaking point

Daisy made her exit pretty quickly after Alpha Alex showed up, she had enough money to pay him back and cover what he had fronted.  We didn't see her come out of her room except for classes and food for the next couple of weeks, so the house was pretty quiet.  This, however, was the calm before a huge shitstorm.

It's not far, the reward is McBeetus for ""muh cuurves"" and to appease the hangover demon.

I get my order and sit outside on the seat in the sun and slowly munch on my food just in case the hangover demon decides to reject its offering.

A mini-van pulls up into the handicap spot and the occupant sits there for some amount of time

A short amount of time passes and some family sedan rolls in

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) the car is *leaning* to one side more and a near morbidly obese woman steps out of the passenger side.

The car itself was lowered moderately but the extra weight of this landwhale pushed it down even more. Height was probably no more than 5'6"" and at least 200kg/440lb

The car is parked next to the disabled spot, logic need not apply to whoever designed the carpark.

Landwhale knocks on the window of the car in disabled parking and the window rolls down.

""UH SCUSE ME

There's a moment of silence and then the occupant shows her the disabled windshield hanger

""AH DUN SEE NO DISABLED PEOPLE HURR"" again yelling

""This hanger isn't for show lady and a matter of fact I am disabled"" the man (after speaking is evident) in the car replies

""WELL WHATEVER IT IS

No it wasn't. It was for the driver. She goes back in

She's somewhat calmed down

Landwhale gets two employees to take out her order as she cannot carry them all at once. All that walking to and from the car must be sapping her of her curves *teehee*

They hand them through the driver's side window while Landwhale waddles slowly back to the car. 

Disabled guy says something along the lines of ""It must be hard with your disability

""AH HAVE BEETUS AND MAH THYROID FLARES UP SO I GOTTA EAT OR I DIE! AND AH DUN NEED NO DOCTUH TO TELL THAT. IT'S GENETIC!"" landwhale yells at him through his window.

Background: I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of years ago, I look fantastic, errbody be mirin'. 

I got assigned a random roommate at my university. Let's call her Mt. Roommate, since she threw out my bathroom scale the day she moved in.

She honestly wasn't horrible to live with. She made me drive her around a lot, and since that is all she ever ate, there were no food stealing issues. She did like to complain about my eating habits and how I must be anorexic, but I never listened much. She didn't shower, and I never saw her change her sheets once. By the end of the semester there was a blob-shaped grease stain on her sheets. Ew.

It was finals week. My mom sent me a care package with some of my favorite sugar-free cookies; delicious but expensive

Well, especially if your body is not used to it, it can cause significant gastro-intestinal upset. That is a nice way to say that if you OD on sorbitol, liquid will be erupting from your various orifices in a most unpleasant manner.

I got home. Mt. Roommate was nowhere to be seen. Neither were the cookies. I heard a low moaning coming from the bathroom. ""Mt Roommate?"" I called apprehensively. A pitiable moan was the only answer. As I approached I started to smell it. Oh sweet Sugar Jesus. I opened the bathroom door.

She was curled up in a puddle of shit and vomit next to the empty cookie package. Mt. Roommate had become Mt. Vesuvius

I lost it. I laughed so hard. Maybe that makes me a bad person. I don't  care. I shut the bathroom door again and went to sleep in the library.

Everyone in the house worked part or full time jobs. Everyone but Maggie. And on top of our work, and would then lock herself in her room for two hours or so and prep for her exam. Andrew worked part time at a grocery store, and then had a shitty internship at doctor's office, so he studied whenever he had a moment.   Me and John were studying for the same exam. Because I worked most afternoons/nights bartending, and John worked security almost every night till about 2, we would study from midmorning till whenever we finished. 

It's kind of obvious we had a pretty rigid schedule. If you interrupted Sasha for anything less then an anthrax outbreak during ""locked door, and as soon as June hit, we went full out. We knew if we could get good scores the first time, we could live the rest of our year as care-free, underemployed young people with years of crushing grad school ahead. 

Maggie would wake up somewhere between 2 and 3 pm. She'd move from her bedroom into the kitchen, and it added to the noise.Then you'd hear the moan of  a couple floor boards, a door slam, then the shower running. Not long after came the violent belting out of several Beatles songs I can't bear to listen to anymore. She absolutely, positively, LOVED the beatles. I'm talking giant posters and general distain for all other music. Now i'm a fan of them, they're great. But I also like other music, I'd get a passive aggressive email (EMAIL) from the other room asking me to wear headphones. If she heard the Beatles, sidetracked. 

All she did was watch television, i guess, but I mean we couldn't use the living room anyway because Maggie was ALWAYS there. Three weeks in, we realized we needed to reclaim it. We didn't spend a lot of time watching tv, so we pushed her favorite couch, dubbed the ""recliner of sweat stain"" into the corner , moved the tv all the way down, but… whatever.

There were two things she got up for. Food, it's a long deal. She would just eat left overs from horrible take out food and SO MUCH CAKE. She would buy it or make it herself, whatever she had to do. Her mom put so much money into her account. I went to the ATM for her once (lol, once. a million times), she would give me $20 to do it(I honestly don't think she left the house more then 3 times a week, on DIRE necessities), and there was well over 2, I nearly fainted. Despite that shit, whatever wasn't green

Her second hobby was harassing us. She was first and foremost obsessed with John and I's friendship. We'd been friends since I hit the guy who was trying to steal his pokemon cards, she'd like to drop by John's room while we were both trying to study and ask us asinine questions. Maggie was, would always be, HAD to be the smartest. This extended to looking over our shoulders at practice tests, and trying to ""help us"". She would ""help us"" until John or I would stare at her in fury until she left

Maggie was also fascinated and mock disgusted by mine and Sasha's habit of maintaining basic hygiene. She called us ""barbies"" and other things that were clearly defensive answers to the fact she only ever wore sweatshirts, to workouts, to shows, but the only invitations she would accept would be the ones with food and no shoe requirements. John and Andrew had guy friends over all the time, and she behaved so rudely to them, like she just knew in their heads they were fat shaming. She was, and I bet in my bones, as well as a feminist when it came to brushing her hair. She didn't need to look good for some ""scummy jock dude"". I don't think she'd actually ever had a functional

There was one awful fight when Sasha and I were going to bachelorette party, and everyone was wolf whistling and acting a fool. This was about a month after we'd moved in, and I'd been seeing a guy, on and off (mostly off), who made some silly joke about ""cleaning up good"" and grabbed my ass. We heard a snort from the greasy side of the room followed by silence as we stared. Maggie looked up and says ""Well, when looking like a doll is all you do all day, you better be good at it"". Fucking WHAT? John asked her how her Ph D in Big Bang Theory reruns was going and she shut up. 

That was always her sore spot. She was Ms. Lit Major, which ended in her screaming i knew nothing about literature because I asked her what other book she liked by her ""favorite author"", besides fucking The Great Gatsby. Classic. 

She was always in bed by 3 or 4 am, it's a mystery.

So at the time I'm 21. In college

I still hate myself for ever being so dumb and naive.

So this park had a roller coaster.  It was insanely popular. It was a Superman coaster

So if you were under  18, or a favorite of the staff, you got patrols.  This meant you got to walk around all day, and essentially do nothing unless something big went down.  The middle guards, which I ended up being, got ride duties.  All the major rides had a guard assigned to them for their shift. You patrolled that ride's line, and that line only.  So you were the one who dealt with every single problem at these rides.  

So, so our busiest day.  The wait time for Superman is well over 3 hours.  So I'm spending my day telling people they can't leave the line to go pee then go back to their spot. Arguing with parents who think I'm an asshole for not accepting a bribe, in front of everyone else, to get to the front of the line.  Dealing with numerous bee stings because why not put bushes all along this giant line.  Not like Bees like nature or anything.

And that's when the fateful call came in.  10-35 at Superman.  Officer Drunken_Black_Belt please respond to the ride platform.  10-35 is the code for unruly person.  When I ascended up to the ride platfrom, it's hard to tell if it's sun burn or from the yelling.  

If you asked this gentleman to do the truffle shuffle on the platform

So this gentleman is standing in the front most car of the ride train

So I approach and ask what the problem is, screaming about how they won't let him ride the ride.  How we are discriminating against him. How he's going to sue.  

Now for the record at the time I was 6'4 and 190.  I had just lost over 80 lbs since the previous summer. I have had weight issues all my life

DBB: Sir

HP: No! I can go with just the seatbelt it's fine. Im studying engineering.

DBB: No sir it's not. Another park did that earlier this year because the lap bar wouldn't fit

HP: Bullshit. This is discrimination.  

DBB: No it's not.

HP: I just waited three hours in the sun in order for you to humiliate me.  

DBB: Sir we provide a car in the front of the line for people to make sure they fit inside.  Did you try it out?

HP: I don't need to I know I fit!  I'm gonna sue

DBB: Well I can bring you to the ticket office

HP: FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE!  JUST CUZ I'M BIGGER I HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST! THIS PLACE IS BULLSHIT.

Ok

DBB: Listen. You know how big you are.

HP:.....What?

DBB: You're an adult. You know how big you are. This is no shock to you.  I can't imagine this is the first time you've run into an issue like this.  It sucks, and you're keeping everyone else from getting on here.  

Suddenly, starts screaming at me.

A NEW CHALLENGER APPEARS!!!

This guy starts yelling that we can't talk to his friend like that.  I'm a bigot. ETC ETC.  He actually squares off and says he's a green belt.

Ok E-Honda.  We can do this.

I'd love to say it was some sort of epic clash between us then.  But in reality I just stood there waiting and eventually he backed down.  I then escorted them to the ticket office to complain.  We had to stop TWICE for HP to catch his breath.  The whole time he's yelling about discrimination. How he's going to sue the park.  How he's going to get me fired. Eventually he gave up when the ticket office wouldn't refund his money and went back into the park. A short while later I saw him in a food area

Fuck. Right in the feels.  So I approached, but I never saw him again.  Wherever you are dude, I hope you're doing better.

**Story Start**
Now
Now
&gt;The fluorescent lights above our table and in the area surrounding began to flicker erratically. 

No problem
&gt;Around us

My freshman mind comprehended it as people just finally starting to eat and wrote it off as not being a sign of something horrifying. 
&gt;Finally, an unspeakable horror from beyond the cusp of our understanding ~~walked~~ ~~waddled~~ oozed towards our table. It was 160cm tall, 130cm wide, apparently male, and had to have at least been 125 kilos. Grasped in it's hand was at least **two** bags of food from Wendys.

Now this, I lost my faith in every deity to ever be worshiped as the beast stopped next to our table, eyeing Gerald's lunch with it's shrunken, dark, beady eyes. My friends and I stared back, wondering what we have done to summon Ham-Sothoth and why it would stop at our table. 
For a second nothing happened, it opened it's mouth to speak. The stench of a thousand lost souls and untold number of burgers devoured hit us like a physical wall, sending Ray sliding down the bench a bit. His voice was loud but oddly high pitched.
&gt;""Hey there *pals*. I couldn't help but notice your fat friend""

At this, at this motion Gerald shrunk slightly as his bully senses started to blare louder than the Air Raid sirens of London.
&gt;""has a chip pack. He's fat enough as is and he has plenty of food. So I'll be taking it

With that, eyes watering at what just happened while Ray attempted to process what exactly had occurred.
Being the first to compose myself, that bag had a large fries, two cheeseburgers, and a frosty. The beast noticed my approach and managed to divert filling his gullet for one moment to address me as [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkLeNuojfA) began to play.
&gt;""What do you want *pal*?""

I bristled at his constant use of pal
&gt;""Look

At my demand
&gt;""He **gave** these chips to me. Why don't you try opening your eyes a bit

Now, I say Asian because I'm of mixed descent being part Chinese and part Japanese. However, I was a fourth generation kid so there was a chance my family has been around as long as this fat asshole's family. Nearing the end of my fuse, it took every bit of my self control to not just floor the fatty right there and then.
&gt;""Look you fat fuck. I don't care what you fucking say to defend yourself. I *saw* you take those chips. Now give them back or I will **make** you give them back.""

With a twinkle in his eye, taking the effort to spit pieces of cheeseburger at me as he did.
&gt;""Well~ If your fat friend wants it back so much...""

He paused, he closed his hand and crushed the bag of chips. The sound of the poor bag popping under the pressure was audible by all as a small spray of chip fragments were sent flying through his knuckles. Opening his hand, he presented me the defiled and broken bag of chips.
&gt;""Then he can have them back like this.""

Now
Now, I snatched Ham-Sothoth's second bag of Wendys faster then he could stop me and with all the might packed into my thirteen year old strength, I smashed the bag into the floor. To ensure the job was really done, I proceeded to jump on the food twice and grind it underneath the hell of my boots while the beast looked on, shocked. As the last of the burger and fries were rendered unidentifiable stains in the floor, I stared into his eyes and growled a single sentence back at him.
&gt;""Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating your food like this.""

Now, how I didn't understand he needed to eat or he would die, and how his diabetes would kill him because of the food that he had failed to consume. Meanwhile, I was shouting back retorts for everything he said and giving him a few good blows of my own. This lasted all of ten seconds before a teacher and the school's cop stepped in and separated the two of us. Right there and then, we were asked what was happening.
Trying to break free of the cop's grip, I shouted something about how he was an asshole bully who picked on freshmen because he was too pathetic to do anything else. With a few shouts of confirmation from those around, the fatty was vanquished to the office for further questioning and sentencing/suspension while I returned to my table victorious and with a teacher's help, we managed to acquire another bag of chips for Gerald.

Oh a few days later I got jumped by Ham-Sothoth's friends and they tried to beat the hell out of me on his command. By the time the cop got there, screaming, and using my backpack like a flail before being taken down by five unharmed guys. That landed me a few weeks in a hospital and got Ham-Sothoth and his friends expelled.


**TL;DR:** First day of school and fat bully takes friend's chips. I make it to his table and demanded it back. He crushes it out of spite so I take his food and destroy it out of spite.

&gt;""Everyone knows it isn't as simple of diet and exercise

&gt;""There's actually not any studies that support that hypothesis

&gt;Professor has clearly never seen fat logic the likes of this before

&gt;""Well I tried to diet and exercise for months and I never lost any weight

&gt;Dafuq

&gt;I decided to speak up ""It worked for me.""

&gt;Hamgar glares Mcdeath at me ""Well you loosing a few pounds and me loosing a lot of weight is different.""

&gt;""Actually I lost more than a few pounds

&gt;""I don't believe you."" Says Hamgar

&gt;Could pull up my shirt and show him stretch marks

&gt;Decide driver's license will suffice

&gt;Walk up steps and set driver's license in front of Hamgar

&gt;""Believe me now?""

&gt;I can feel the hatred as Hamgar glares at me

&gt;Professor is smiling wide ""I'm happy to hear you were able to loose weight

&gt;Go on to talk a bit about the low carb diet I went on and some of the exercise advice I found useful

&gt;Hamgar quiet for rest of class

&gt;Later

&gt;""Hey!""

&gt;I turn to see a raging walrus coming at me

&gt;Wait its Hamgar

&gt;My god he has no food in his hand

&gt;See my life flash before my eyes as I'm sure I'm about to be eaten

&gt;[mfw](http://imgur.com/JGvXLpO)

&gt;Hamgar opens his mouth and a tide of stench assaults me along with his words

&gt;""I don't appreciate you calling me out like that in class.""

&gt;""Sorry man

&gt;""You were just trying to fat shame me.  Its hard for me to loose weight

&gt;That pissed me off a bit, gritting my teeth and ignoring shitty food cravings

&gt;Also this dude was talking loud

&gt;""No it wasn't easy

&gt;""You don't think I work hard?"" the elephant trumpeted

&gt;Wut.jpeg

&gt;""Are you serious?  Have you even paid attention to how much shit you have eaten this semester in this class alone?""

&gt;His pig eyes were seething

&gt;""I didn't eat that much.""

&gt;I can see the looks of shocked disbelief on everyone's faces

&gt;""You ate bags of chips and drank liters of soda within the 3 hour span of this class.  Every time I saw you in this class you were eating enough calories to feed a family of 3 for a day.""

&gt;He goes into his thyroid-beetus rant

&gt;Normally I would just smile and nod like a beta

&gt;""If you can seriously say that you think you have a significant thyroid problem and that the solution of diabetes is to eat lots of crap

&gt;Hamgar looks around but his actions over the past 14 weeks have not won him any friends

&gt;""I bet I'm doing better in the class than you are.""  Hamgar sounded strangely like a 5th grade kid arguing over who the better super hero is 

&gt;Wat mode level 2

&gt;The professor had read out the names of the people with the tops grades after every test

&gt;""You know that's bullshit

&gt;Hamgar shot back ""He never read yours either.""

&gt;The girl who Hamgar took an interest in in part 3 speaks up

&gt;Been working dat studying hard all semester

&gt;Hamgar begins to fall back on his flimsiest logic

&gt;""Well at least I'm happy.  Depriving yourself and starving all day is no way to live your life.""

&gt;Decide to speak the truth ""Keep eating the way you have been and you won't have a very long life to enjoy.""

&gt;People burst out into laughter

&gt;I didn't mean it to be funny

&gt;Bacon grease runs from Hamgar's eyes and he goes waddling off as fast at his lard-weighted legs can carry him

&gt;Receive several pats on the back and ""He had it coming""s

&gt;See professor standing at end of hall

&gt;Don't feel bad about causing the beast some emotional pain

&gt;Hamgar didn't show up the next day

&gt;Guess the predictions in the comments were right


Thus ends the Hamgar saga.  Let us take a moment to mourn all the foods that died so bravely to give Hamgar his precious calories so that he did not turn his voracious appetite on his fellow man.  I still have a handful or incidents with Hamgar from the semester that don't warrant a full story themselves

By the time school started, ""Scott"" who was in a band. Eric was seeing ""Cheryl."" Cheryl is a pretty, petite redhead who worked at the same bar with Eric. 

Ginger, here's a comparison. Cheryl is petite, under five feet, maybe 110 pounds at the most. Long auburn hair, tan skin, no luscious curves to speak of. Ginger is about the same height, but weighed two hundred pounds more. Cheryl is sweet, and soft-spoken. Ginger is obnoxious, Ginger is outraged. They are practically the same person

One night, I decided to bunk with Eric. We were watching a movie on his computer, when I see a pink heart-shaped Post-it on Eric's pillow. Curious, I decide to read it. I remember the words exactly.

""Roses are red. Violets are blue. You don't know it

Sappy as fuck. I cringe and make fun of Eric for it,"" I say to him, and ask if he and Cheryl are having problems. Then Eric confesses that it's not from Cheryl. The spots of grease and the scent of deep-fried chicken skin on Eric's bed suddenly made sense. Eric reveals that ever since he started dating Cheryl, these ""love notes"" had started appearing all over his room. They were on his pillow, under his keyboard, on his shoes, in the bathroom mirror, he'd just throw them away. It was easy for Eric to avoid Ginger anyways, Ginger was the cause of it all.

The biggest point of contention was probably food. Remember the ""you pay for your own food"" rule? Ginger would go to to the grocery store every few days, frozen roast beef. If it wasn't that, it was fast food, pizza, or Chinese. It meant that she took about 98% of the freezer, and if you complained to Ginger about it she'd just argue that the refrigerator was too small. Yuri and I ate like a normal human being, meaning some vegetables, bread and some lunch meat because he got free meals at the bar where he worked. If the rest of us ate someone's food

Ginger would always deny having taken any of our food or refuse to pay us back and claim to be constantly broke even though I assumed she spent at least a hundred dollars a week on her microwave foods. Mama and Daddy were still paying for everything. Ginger and Yuri would have screaming matches every week because of the stolen food, she tries to pass the phone to Yuri ""because Daddy wants to talk to you about this!"" Yuri laughs in her face, and he and Scott go upstairs for you-know-what. I escaped to Luke's next door while Yuri and Scott bumped uglies very loudly and Ginger cried on the phone to her father.

But back to Eric and Cheryl. She and Eric didn't date for very long- less than a month, but Yuri was and he relayed me the story. Eric rarely had a day off, and since that was a special occasion Cheryl decided that she wanted to make a home-cooked dinner for him. Yuri decided to read in our room to give them some privacy. Ginger is not as inclined. She's so jealous and she doesn't hide it. Yuri said that when she saw Eric and Cheryl cuddling on the couch, she waddled straight to her room, changed into this low-cut red dress, and jumped into the couch right next to them. Cheryl's too nice for her own good and doesn't object and Eric doesn't want to yell at her because he's trying to bang Cheryl and yelling at Ginger would probably not lead to sexytimes. Ginger refuses to leave them alone and even cuts into their dinner even though Cheryl only cooked two steaks for her and Eric. Ginger gets a steak, and Cheryl and Eric share the other. All through the dinner, but saintly Cheryl just keeps interrupting him and tells him to be nice to Ginger. Meanwhile

I have to stop here because I have to leave for work now

&gt;TL;DR at bottom.

Fuck guys
So nice summers day afternoon when a moving truck and a minivan comes up to this house that was recently sold, 120kg I guesstimate it at. They have the movers take out two chairs set one up by the door to the house and one inside I assume because the man sat down outside the house directing them where to put stuff, and I can only assume the woman did the same.

So after that is done everyone says hello and all that, I hope she's hot!"" but we all know the odds here, right. ""She"" The Manatee (unoriginal I know) is about 150cm at 110kg and I couldn't be any less attracted to her even if she was literally Jabba the Hut which is important to this story.

So there I am mowing dat lawn on another nice summers day and The Manatee comes over and introduces herself and tells me that her mom said that there were a cute boy living next door. She tells me what she likes, she waits outside as I go into her house and kill and loot the creature, I go outside on the porch and get a thank you hug and I go back to mowing the lawn. Now you fully expect me to write about how The Manatee came over furious about how I would cheat on her, but no. As I ride my bike 20 minutes (each way) to my grandmother to say hello and mow their lawn I see her waving at me from a window. Mowing their lawn which takes about an hour and half, when I get back I've been gone 2 hours 10 minutes give or take. When I got to my house I see here there in a window winking and waving at me. She was waiting for me in that window for over 2 hours, I just cringe and go inside.

The next day Jessica who has an in ground pool was having a get-together or a party as you might call it. Practically anyone was invited, drinking, eating, swimming, other stuff and The Manatee shows up in a bikini. I ask Thor why he would do such a thing to me as I continue talking to Jessica and one of her female friends. The Manatee goes straight for the beetus juice and snacks. An hour passes and and everyone has been in the pool at least once, except The Manatee. Over the course of that hour The Manatee gives every girl I talk to the evil eye and eye rapes me several time. I was once a again talking to Jessica as we walk at the edge of the pool and she slips, I somehow catch her and that is when The Manatee makes her move. The Manatee walks up to me asks me if I'd like to go somewhere more ""private"" as I'm literally holding Jessica from when she fell, I'm kinda busy"" she gives me and Jessica the eye and she waddles off to the table with food and drinks.

By now someone had notices that The Manatee a creature of the sea has not been in the water at all and asks her why. She tells this brave person that she has a bad knee, while gulping down that 1,5L beetus juice. A few more hours pass and the party dies down and everyone left. I stay behind to help Jessica to clean up as I just live next door, we find that someone has been stuffing the mattress box with candy wrappers and empty bottles. I know who did it but decided not to tell Jessica as she was blissfully unaware. We finish up and I get a peck on the cheek and a hug as thanks for the help and I got back to my house for some downtime.

Around noon the next day I go outside for some fresh air and hear a crying sound coming from Jessicas house. I go over to see what it's about. I see Jessica there sitting on the porch crying

&gt;""I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND YOU SKINNY WHORE! HE LIKES REAL WOMEN NOT STICKS LIKE YOU!""

After that she walks up to me tries to put her hands on me that

After an hour Jessica had calmed down and told me that The Manatee came up to her

The story that follows is rather long

Company policy says all new employees have to take a first aid course. Not the most appealing way to spend 10 hours on a Saturday

Rock up on the day of the training course and meet a bunch of my fellow new employees. About 10 of us. Pretty much your average mix of young people working a shitty job to pay the bills - cute jock guy, miscellaneous non-descripts, etc.

Oh, 320lbs. 

The course gets started. The first session is all about medical emergencies - heart attack, etc. Based on my observations of the high volume of manatees that wallow in our pools whilst eating a never ending smorgasbord of fried or frozen fat and drinking bottomless cups of liquid sugar, this is the type of first aid they want us to learn the most.  

Our instructor is one of those guys who likes to use personal examples to illustrate his lessons. He asks us all to share our stories. We start the day learning about what to do if someone's having a heart attack.

""Has anyone here been present when somebody's had a heart attack?""

A couple of people share their stories. Shy book nerd's dad had a heart attack last year. Cute jock guy visited his gran-ma in hospital a few hours after she had a heart attack. Landwhale pipes up.

""I once had a small blockage near my heart. Not quite a heart attack

Please. I read my course material. A heart blockage is a heart attack. You're 25 and you've had a heart attack. 

A heart attack.

At 25.

The instructor looks a bit shocked and doesn't really know what to say. He quickly moves on.

An hour or so later we get to learning all about the beetus. The instructor goes down his usual path of seeking personal stories. I'm sure you know the personal story that appeared

The morning session finishes with us practicing what to do if someone is unconscious - basically you check that they're breathing and roll them onto their sides. I end up in a group of 3 with landwhale and cute jock guy. 

We take it in turns to be the unconscious patient and to be the person who puts the unconscious patient on their side. It's my job to roll landwhale onto her side. I literally can't. I'm F/21/5'5/140lbs - landwhale isn't going anywhere with me pushing. What's worst is that I have nothing solid to push. My hands just get sucked into these soft  jello-like vortexes where the hip and shoulder bones should be. 

Cute jock guy is clearly a lifter

Lunch time. I'm having tuna on rye crackers

The afternoon session is all about injuries. We quickly arrive at the topic of dislocations and fractures.

Instructor: ""Dislocations and fractures can be very painful. Has anyone here ever had one of these injuries?""

The war stories start.

Me: ""I dislocated my finger once when I was playing lacrosse and got smacked hard by an opponent's stick.""

Landwhale shakes her head like she pities me. 

Cute jock guy: ""Fractured my arm playing football.""

Another shake of the landwhale's head. And a heffalump sigh. Then it's her turn.

""I dislocated both of my knees recently.""

Instructor: ""Oh

Landwhale (laughing) : ""I don't know. I was just walking up some stairs and they went. It was really weird.""

Wut?

You dislocated your knees because you were walking up stairs?

I have had a striker kick me **hard** in the knee while I was goalkeeping in soccer and my knee didn't dislocate.

Dislocated knee.

Walking.

Up stairs.

Instructor: ""Wow. You've really been in the wars haven't you?""

Landwhale: (Laughing) ""I know. I guess I just lost the genetic lottery. Mom and dad have real bad knees

Yeah. That's what caused your heart attack

Goofy Hipster decides to break the shocked silence that has enveloped the room.

""I broke my wrist when I was cycling to college the winter before last and slid on some ice."" 

Instructor: ""Wow. Exact same thing happened to me about 5 years ago. riding my bike to work

Landwhale shakes her head again. Decides to say something.

""Wow. Two broken wrists

I'm speechless. I am without speech. So is everyone else in the room. 

I thought people like this only existed on places like /r/fatpeoplestories. But they're real and they work at an amusement park near you.

1375169691.0,1jc3qd,Hamplanets Drive An Anorexic Girl To Tears,dadoodad,776,123,148,"Hello fellow beetus sufferers &amp; condishun lovers! 

My last tale involved me vomiting due to the eldritch stench of a hamplanet while at work (I'm an RMT). This one will be about a young woman trying to STOP vomiting at all. What do I mean? Read on &amp; prepare to gorge on a double helping of fat logic.

Note: Formatting will be crap as I'm writing this from my phone so please bare with me until my desktop is back up &amp; running. And apologies for the length. Always with the length.

This tale occurs in May of this year. I'm a very skinny fat 30 year old male (only fat on me is on my stomach but theres quite a bit) just beginning my journey into lifting and as such I'm very VERY beta and too self conscious to lift amongst groups of people. So I do most of my work at a 24 hour gym very late/very early where there may only be 5 people in the whole place

First, very tiny (lets call her ""Powergirl"" or PG...she likes DC comics) and struggling to perform certain lifts properly. I may not be strong, but I do know proper form. Hoping I wouldn't come off as a creepy old guy in an almost empty gym with minimal staff, I ask her if she wouldn't mind some help with her form. Luckily for me, she didn't hurl the dumbells at me &amp; accepted my offer. Up close she was far smaller than I thought, almost emaciated but she did have a healthy glow &amp; energy to spare. 

Over the following days &amp; weeks we'd see each other very late or early &amp; chat. After a few weeks she felt comfy enough to tell me why she's working out at this ungodly hour. She's a recovering anorexic. She didn't go into details but she had a rough childhood filled with physical

Now that the back story has been dealt with, no soul destroying stench wafting from foul nether regions of existence...they looked like they were there to work. 

""Good for them!"" I think with a slight nod &amp; smile towards them. 

 No smile nor nod back, bit of a bottom &amp; hips (I'm still a guy, I can't help but notice) and a noticeable bounce in her step. Knowing what she told me about her life, seeing her look happier plucked at my heart strings a bit. And for today, she wanted me to spot her during her attempt at her first bench press doing more than the bar! 

Lets do this!!

She only had 10 pounds total added to the bar (5 a side) but its a start! Shub &amp; Yog are about 10 feet away sitting at the leg extension machines with a direct sightline of the bench press station. They can see us &amp; we can see them. PG banged out a set of 5 reps without a wobble

Color me impressed!! 

I give her a high five

They seem oddly interested in something over here...oh god...please don't let my minimal gains attract these two entities...I left my copy of the Necronomicon at home!! I'm helpless!! 

Trying not to run screaming

""Scuse me (they may be horrible beasts but they still have Canadian manners) but me &amp; ma friend here thinks you shouldn't be here any more. Ya see

....wut....

""I'm sorry

""We needs ta be here, just get outta here ya twig"". 

Urge to kill....rising....

I can feel PG starting to tremble on the bench beside me &amp; hear her starting to breathe faster &amp; shorter...she's panicking. 

Shubs powers of darkness overwhelm my retort and it utters the words of darkness that no one who has been through what PG has been through should ever hear: ""Who ya kidding, I gots a weak stomach &amp; can't see dat shit. It'll make me sick! You'd like dat huh? Den you can keep showin off your bones. Get rid of us curvy girls eh?"" 

PG is sobbing now &amp; trembling worse than I thought humanly possible.  

Shubs horrible assault continues: ""Oh crap, you gunna make us sick, I can't get sick!!"" 

Poor PG has had enough &amp; with a speed that took me by surprise she darts across the weight room crying &amp; mumbling to herself heading towards the lockr rooms. 

""Ha!!! See?!?! I knew dat bitch was a puker! Why the hell is a guy like you with her? You gonna be gettin poked when you fuck her

That's fucking it!!!

I'm beyond furious by then.  The shock is gone, these two..things..would merely reform under my blows &amp; continue their horrendous mocking. 

""Look

Its hard to think of good insults when you're a furious geek. 

At this point I think I just let loose a very long string of barely comprehensible insults. Hell I almost passed out from screaming at those two elders of evil. I don't have a condishun

Some of my words seems to have stunned Shub &amp; Yog into silence (am I a wizard?). The two night shift staff are now here with jaws on the floor as well. I run towards the locker rooms to check on PG while flipping off Shub &amp; Yog only stopping at the door way to call her name. No response. Oh fuck. 

I pretty much yank the female staff member to the locker room &amp; tell her to look for PG. No sign of her. I demand that they check the security cameras to see if she's anywhere on the property. No sign. But according to the electronic sign in/out she had apparently left during my tirade against the gruesome twosome. 

To cut this short
Now onto the sad part. I don't know what happened to PG. I haven't seen her at our ""usual"" time and neither has the night staff. Its been a couple months and I'll admit

&gt; Workin' a long shift

&gt; RW appears to take over for me

Now

&gt; Strange expression on the whale's face

&gt; Looks similar to the face she makes when she doesn't get free food from restaurants

&gt; Probably anger

&gt; wat?

&gt; RW ""You KNEW I was getting married at the end of May and you just *had* to go and ruin it by getting married behind my back! You are such a *bitch*. I swear

P being one of our managers.

&gt; P ""RW says that you just yelled at her in front of customers and coworkers

&gt; P is overweight

&gt; ""When have you ever known me to comment about anyone else's weight? She's lying to you and if you call G in here

G had been standing nearby growing more and more red in the face during our exchange. Mofo has my back.

&gt; G comes in to the office

&gt; P asks G what happened up front

&gt; G ""That stupid bitch just will not leave Viza alone. Everyday she comes in here - Every. Damn. Day. She makes some comment about her weight, she's gonna get jumped in the parking lot.""

Yes. That is how G talks to our managers. Yes. They are fine with it.

1375399832.0,1jj2ic,UPDATE: Two Hamplanets Drive An Anorexic Girl To Tears,dadoodad,785,148,107,"Desktop is still down

The last time I was on here I told the story of how I had an informal gym buddy who was a young recovering anorexia sufferer who was driven out of the gym by a oair of evil hamplanets that I have dubbed Shub &amp; Yog (Shub Niggurath &amp; Yog Sothoth of Lovecraftian fame). Not only do those names sound hamplanet worthy

Here's a quick recap:
- meet young female anorexia sufferer very late/very early at gym
- help her with lifts
- one day two blobs ridicule her to the point she runs out

Thanks very much to the Redditors who suggested I ask the gym to contact her to check on her. I'm still smacking myself for not thinking of it sooner. 

They managed to get ahold of a family member who has been caring for her and sadly things didn't go well after the gym event. :(

PG (PowerGirl) relapsed. Hard. From what I was told she began purging and began hurting herself in more overt ways. I wasn't given much information (neither was the gym) but it was severe enough to require emergency hospitalization. 

But

The gym owner has offered their sincere apologies and support and they were kind enough to relay a message of support &amp; encouragement from me. 

Its infuriating to know that those two acolytes of the Great Old One Shum-Adipose drove a young kid back into hell for no reason whatsoever! PG didn't even look in their direction that morning and yet...well...read the story. 
All you beetus sufferers &amp; victims of thin privilege, but it seems the smaller people are particularly vulnerable. Especially when they're trying to stay out of a sentient gravity well. 

It remains to be seen if PG will return to this gym once she's no longer deemed a danger to herself or if she'll return to a gym at all. But I'll keep FPS posted if she does. 

She's safe now &amp; that's a relief. From what I saw of her she's a tough one &amp; she WILL make it

Fucking blobs eh?

This story takes place a few years back when I was dating my now ex-boyfriend. While dating this guy, all the while calling me fat. For the record I was 18F 5’ 11” and 177lbs. He was 5’10” and 210lbs. His family was far worse though. His mother (Porkus Rotundus) was a swelling planet of about 340lbs at 5’4”. His father (Ham Mountain), a mountain of a man, approximately 6’6” and a staggering 500lbs+ Their idea of a fun day out was going to eat at a Chinese Barffet (see what I did there?). This is where our story takes place . . .


As we approach the double doors of the Chinese Barffet


Without a word to the hostess

&gt;“I want ta sit close ta the food so’s I dun have ta walk as far.” 

With actions I did not believe possible from a man of his size


I watch in disgust as PR’s arm fat

&gt;No! Don’t do it! For the love of God why?!

She begins licking the sauce off her arm folds! I nearly lose it then and there. My appetite has vanished and has been replaced with a churning feeling of nausea. 


My ex returns to the table with a heaping plate of food, grease, and deep fried. I sip my water and watch as the family goes into beast mode. No forks, no spoons, nothing. They are scooping their food into their mouths, which are so close to the table, it was hard to tell if they were bringing the food to their mouths or if they had just decided to give up and stick their faces directly in it. 


After they finish, and begin to wheeze. They had actually stopped breathing in order to consume the food faster. There was no room for air as they choked down their meals. After a few minutes of labored breathing, they scooted out of their chairs and stumbled up to the buffet for seconds. This time, they had their eyes set on the crab legs. 


As a herd, leaving nothing for the other customers. Again they ate as though they need not breathe; cracking and slurping the meat from the legs. I manage to share a few legs from my ex’s plate. 


Once finished, and wait. I must admit, for hamplanets, they were surprisingly patient. After about 10 minutes of standing there, picking food from the buffet and eating it while they watched the kitchen door for any signs of movement, a server approaches them. 

&gt;“We will not bring anymore crab. You are done! Go!”


Do my ears deceive me? Was this heap of heaving hippos just told to stop eating? While this is an all you can eat buffet

&gt;“HOW DARE YEW! MAH FAMILY PAID TO EAT HERE! THIS IS A BUFFET AND WE CAN EAT AS MUCH AS WE WANT! “

&gt;“You eat all of the crab legs! No other customers can get any!”

&gt;“THEY JIST ERN’T FAST ENOUGH. THEY CAN HAVE WHAT WE DON’T TAKE. YEW CAN’T TELL US WHAT WE CAN EAT!”

&gt;“Go now! You don’t get any more food.”

&gt;“WELL


At this point I can only watch

&gt;Be at college not too long ago

&gt;Decide to go to a get together with a few buddies to watch Game of Thrones. Host tells me to feel free to bring anyone along

&gt;Remember that my good friend and love interest, I ask if she’d like to come along.
 
doesabearshitinthewoods.jpg

&gt;Carol’s around 5ft. and weighs no more than 100lbs. soaking wet. She’s got amazing boobies

&gt;We arrive somewhat late and the hair immediately stands up on the back of my neck when we reach the door. My stomach tells me to run 

&gt;It’s here 

&gt;Plopped on the couch like a dead whale chillin’ on the beach

&gt;Somehow she got the idea that we were her best friends till death do we part after she was shown kindness once. 

Bigmistake.jpg

&gt;Now

&gt;The well of kindness was running dry because we found out why she had no friends- she was cunt. A big fat cunt.

&gt;This behemoth stands around 5ft. 7in. and weighs about as much as a small grizzly bear (around 400lbs). Think of Honeyboo boo’s mom covered in Hot Topic crap. That’ll give you an idea of what we’re working with. Along with her girth

&gt;Has no idea why it’s allowed on the couch

&gt;Her beady little eyes immediately lock on me like I'm a fresh extra-large pizza with all the works. I can see her eyes glaze over.

&gt;Then she sees Carol. Tons of fun here has the hots for me since the beginning and is very displeased that I brought beautiful eye candy that can hold a conversation that doesn’t involve food or about how fat she is. 
Ohgod.jpg

&gt;‘Who the hell she?’ Jabba asks in the shittiest tone possible. 

&gt;Head exploding glares are exchanged between Carol and Paula

&gt;‘This is Carol’ I reply calmly but the beast can smell my fear like it’s a new bakery 10 miles away

&gt; ‘Who said you could bring her?’  

&gt; ‘I did’ announces the host. This rustles her enormous jimmies even farther into oblivion

&gt;Whatever and just watch GoT

&gt;All is well in the Land of Oz until about half way through the second episode

&gt;The Omnomnomasaurus begins her whale calls about the same generic fat-shit blabber: “men heart mah curves! (despite never having a boyfriend) The female characters are anorexic! Fat mean healthy! Blah blah blah blah”.

yougettheidea.jpg

&gt;I was surprised she managed to keep it in that long

&gt;The beast tries to make it seem like the comments aren’t directed at Carol but we’re not stupid. If you’re going to talk shit about someone and you don’t want them to think you’re taking about them

&gt;When she finally finishes whining about this

&gt;It’s cool. Everyone else is hungry too

&gt;Everyone chips on for three large pizzas and even the colossus gives a contribution which was rare

&gt;We wait for the food to arrive and she complains the entire time about them not being fast enough. She started in right after the Host made the call 

&gt;She’s going to faint if they don’t hurry! 

mahbeetus.jpg

&gt;False Alarm. She brought a fucking keg’s worth of coke for herself and a filthy backpack filled to the brim with candy and junk. 

&gt;Never offered anything to anyone… no one was man enough to eat anything that came out of that backpack anyway

&gt;Despite her precious warchest

&gt;Bitch

&gt;Pizza finally arrives and the beast inhales a whole one by itself before setting in on another. One slice was a bite and this is after eating nearly half her bag of “emergency goodies” as she called them. teehee

&gt;GoT stream fucks up so we take a break from watching to chit chat as we feast

&gt; Being the only hottie gal in the room

&gt;Because Carol’s a badass

&gt;This angers the Giant to the breaking point. 

&gt;“Why the hell aren’t these guys being pulled into my field of gravity?!” she ponders to herself

&gt; “Do you have a boyfriend?” one asks 

&gt;“Nope” Carol replies. She’s a hot catlady and prefers singledom 

&gt;“No wonder! You’re soooo anorexic/don’t have curves/etc. Couldn’t even finish more than three slices! men want real women ” the beached whale announces. It’d finally been given a reason to attack Carol directly

&gt;“The fuck did you say to me!?” Carol roars like a mighty tiger 

&gt;Most people brush off her comments 

&gt;Everyone is visibly startled

&gt;It takes her a few moments to calculate what happened before spitting out “I didn’t stutter you skinny little bitch!” 

&gt;Carol’s face is reddest I’ve ever seen on a human

&gt;No one had the balls to stand up to the beast before today

&gt;The colossal squid makes a few more shitty comments before a yelling match ensues between the two

&gt;The rest of us are just sitting in the background

&gt;Do we break it up? Do we watch? Let’s find out

&gt;The beast eventually maneuvers itself into a standing positions and the clash of the titans begins

&gt;Fat as Fatass waddles over to Carol like some creeping crud and backhands her hard enough to nearly knock her down

&gt;Ursula (sea witch from the little mermaid) then gets a shitty grin since she’s not expecting any retaliation. This kind of thing had happened before 

&gt;Carol. fucking. loses it

ohyoudunitnow.jpg

&gt;Before anyone knew it

&gt;Carol does P90X so I know she’s doing damage 

&gt;We eventually snapback to reality and pull her off the bloodied creature. It took three of us to peel a 100lb girl out of this lard pile

&gt;She got what she finally deserved but we still felt sort of sorry for her

&gt;The dough girl sits up and is distraught but apparently didn’t learn anything. She immediately begins running her mouth again

&gt;Sympathy gone

&gt;At this point

&gt; “Get out and don’t come back” the host says to her. “or we’ll let her go at you again and we won’t pull her off this time”

&gt;Carol had become the ultimate weapon

&gt; Without protest

&gt;We never spoke to King Size again. I still see her occasionally on campus and it seems she managed to find a herd of her own kind 

&gt;Viva la freedom!

**TL;DR- fat bitch runs her mouth and gets the shit kicked out of her by someone not even half her size**

Quell your russling jimmies, and hamplanet extraordinaire.

**Dramatis Personae**

The Spousatron - Muh husband in training - 6'0 170lbs maybe

Moi - 5'8 - 137lbs - also trying not to be a hamplanets

The landlady - actually my best friend. Large woman

Billyum Beetus - 6'4 of solid 300lb+ beetus. A flatmate.

**The Story**


I know The Spouse-a-tron and Billyum Beetus from years ago. We were all members of my university's tabletop gaming society. But back when I first met them

Spouse-a-tron and I were looking for a flat and Landlady's parents who are property buyers had just finished fixing up a 3 bedroom number and were offering it at a super low rent price to us me being besties with Landlady, and we thought he was a pretty cool guy.

&gt;note: as will be discussed later

&gt;be slightly confused why Beetus kept saying it was terrible to live there

&gt;should have been warning sign but benefit of the doubts

Beetus took forever sorting out a move out/in date, had some beers, set up the xbox on our big tv along one wall of the living room for the Netflix and a gaming night. Beetus had gone to the toilet while we got all this set up and had a strange look on his face when he saw we'd set up the tv with the sofa facing it. We ignore it, maybe post loo bowels were still settling.

&gt;Pizza arrives

&gt; had ordered 2 medium pizzas

&gt;apparently not.

The Spouse-a-tron and I managed about 2/3 of a pizza between us

&gt;LAWLNOPE.jpeg

Beetus eats his whole pizza

&gt;Fair enough

&gt;we've both had days like that.

[[Side note

Ok back to Beetus. Beetus returns some 15 minutes later with chips

Let me explain the Glaswegian concept of Pizza Crunch to you.

&gt;Be a whole 10-12"" Pizza

&gt;be deep fried in batter

&gt;be doused in vinegar and salt

&gt;be fucking delicious

&gt;be something in the vicinity of 2000 calories a slice.

&gt;be hangover food of the gods.

Love me some Pizza crunch

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/StjzO.gif) he devours a whole one

&gt;Be not judging. 

Well we put on the Netflix

Next morning I woke up at 6 to the sound of roaring. I head downstairs to find Beetus had moved our couch to face the other wall

&gt;Landlady and us had discussed we keep as few electronics in the front room as possible.

&gt;Live in ground floor condo in neighbourhood immediately next to council housing apartment blocks.

&gt;Council housing is given to people in need

&gt;We have the kind with scummy [NEDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_\(Scottish\))

&gt; our tv is fucking massive

&gt;Backdoor is kept perpetually locked and curtains kept shut to obscure.

&gt;laptops hidden upstairs at night

Beetus is ignoring this memo because he wants HIS gaming set up downstairs. His tv moniter is also massive so it's kind of distracting when it's pretty much perpendicular to the big tv.

&gt;we have skybox set up to our tv fyi

I also discover Beetus has come down to cram as many gaming hours as possible

&gt;Brown sauce is made of brown

&gt;delicious brown sauce.

My half asleep brain finally processes that he's sitting in a bathrobe that goes to his mid thigh

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/CRACRU2.gif) I realise that's not just leg fat

""Beetus

**""I REDECIDED. YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE MY STUFF DOWN HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY GAMING RIG.""**

""No, not even my xbox is going to stay down here because I was going to keep it upstairs attached to our bedroom TV. We are literally just going to have the skybox and the tv down here.""

**""Just because the landlady is your friend doesn't mean you get to make the rules""**

&gt;actually part of our rent agreement is that I am landlady's representative in the house

&gt;I make sure guidelines and rules in tenancy agreement get followed.

&gt;It's why our rent is so fucking cheap

&gt;distracting because when Beetus talks

I don't want a fight I head upstairs. Asking could he please just turn it down as it is 6 am.

&gt;Get back in bed

&gt;Tell the Spouse-a-tron what transpired

&gt;resume half asleep cuddles

At a more reasonable hour we go to the shops and get groceries for the place. Spouse-a-tron and I are on budget so we get healthy foods.

Beetus says he will get his food at his work because he gets a discount. Beetus brings home a month's worth of frozen family platters.

&gt;eats 3 a night

&gt;still has room to eat all of our ice cream and drink all of our pepsi.

&gt;drinks all my special lactose free ""derp milk""

&gt;Derp milk is expensive yo.

Every morning was the same. At 6am or earlier

&gt;&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/SVeiptk.jpg) every damn morning.

And every damn evening he'd eat all our food.

One day I'm making dinner for everyone.

&gt;healthy pork stir fry

&gt;homemade marinade

&gt;lots of veggies

&gt;rice noodles

&gt;I am a fucking boss when it comes to stir fry.

Beetus is watching Spouse-a-tron play Bioshock in other room. I hear their converstion.

**""Ugh I feel so overweight. How do you deal with being overweight?""**

&gt;Spouse-a-tron is maybe 170lbs at max.

&gt;Also has way more patience

""If I feel too pudgy, and I try to cut back on portion sizes. I'm going running tomorrow morning, want to come with?""

**""Oh I can't run. I have bad knees and asthma.""**

""You should ask chesZilla about the asthma and knees

**""Like I would ask her

&gt;[MFW](http://replygif.net/i/101.gif)

&gt;I know I've gained a bit of weight since being out of work

&gt;be really self conscious about it.

&gt;be 150lbs max

""No really, maybe she'll take you swimming with her sometime?""

**""Nah man

&gt;jesustakethewheel.exe

That weekend we text Beetus saying ""we're going to have couple movie night

&gt;Couple -&gt; implying we'd be makin out on couch.

Beetus doesn't respond.

&gt;make small roast lamb for dinner.

&gt;it's delicious.

&gt;planned so leftovers are our lunch tomorrow.

&gt;Beetus gets home from work about 15 minutes into the movie.

&gt;It's Treasure Planet

&gt; hadn't put leftovers away yet because romantic cuddle times

&gt;Beetus's first action is to take a plate out of the cupboard and scoop all the leftovers onto it and inhale it.

&gt;without even asking.

&gt;[OFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/I_has_a_sad.gif) it was enough for us to have lunch for the next 2 days.

&gt;Beetus sits down on the couch next to us still inhaling food.

&gt;Takes up 1/2 the couch on his own.

&gt;Still wearing sweaty work clothes.

&gt;Reeks like he hasn't bathed in weeks.

**""OH HEY TREASURE PLANET? YEAH I SUPPOSE IT'S AN OK MOVIE

&gt;starts pointing out all the flaws in it.

&gt;gets bored of pointing out flaws

&gt;Turns on his TV next to us

&gt;doesn't even use headphones.

Spouse-a-tron being way more patient than I

1376172465.0,1k40r0,Thin Privilege is having your coworkers actually believe you're pregnant.,rbs14k,818,186,90,"While reading a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1k2786/women_and_burgers_first/cbkpjmr) in another [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1k2786/women_and_burgers_first/) I remembered this crappy little tale (I apologize in advance for my ramblings) from a few years ago when I worked with an aspiring hamplanet. No greentext for you since I suck at it and the story isn't very good anyway so let's not make it worse.

I worked with a woman years ago that on top of being a compulsive liar was also 5'4 and in the neighborhood of 280 lbs (163 cm

This idiot managed to find another, 158 kg) to not only marry her but impregnate her as well.

She couldn't be anymore elated at the prospect of being married to a 30-something year old waiter, as well as a generous discount from his employer who if memory serves was McCallister's, Panera or some other faux-artisanal sandwich shop.

The plodding gentle giant had but 2 loves in life – his hamplanet princess and stuffing said planet's gullet (amongst other things^teehee ).

So after several months of this woman's constant 'white lies' including:

- ""My grandmother is German and used to take me back to germany with her for Oktoberfest"" - She had never been out of the country

- ""I used to be fluent in Spanish but I lost it"" - Her father was a 2nd or 3rd generation Mexican-American that was far from fluent and didn't use the language at home. She would constantly 'flaunt"" her ""Mexicanness"" around the office and attempt to badger our customers with butchered Spanish

- ""All of the male and lesbian customers keep staring at my breasts"" - Bitch

- ""My parents gave me the middle name _____ because ^blahbahblahblah ..."" - Her parents didn't giver her a middle name so she made one up when she took her husbands name. She then made up an ever changing backstory about the historical significance and how it had been passed down from generation to generation of malfunctioning thyroid ridden Aztec warrior queen.

But I digress.

*Ahem.* So after several months of her white lies, this one.

But alas

We of course figured that this was another attention grab and excuse to eat all of the things.

At this point she was already chewing^teehee through at least $15 in food a day just for lunch on top of the meals her planetmate dropped off every so often. Once she found out she was pregnant that figure no less than tripled. God only knows what she was eating for dinner and snacks at home.

She would show up with a bag of McBeetus or Beetus-Fil-A in hand in the morning and then promptly duck out an hour or 2 later to run to the gas station for snacks. Then would come lunch, Outfat Steakhouse, etc. Then would come a delivery from her beau, typically some sort of large sandwich smothered in gravy with chips and a side of something that had at one point been a vegetable but was now drowning in processed cheese and the hopes and dreams of some forlorn cardiologist. The rest of the workday would be spent discussing what she was going to pick up for dinner on the way home.

It didn't help that her roly poly figure was already so engulfed with adipose tissue that even after she was well into her 2nd trimester half of the office still thought she was faking it. There was even a betting pool circulating as to whether or not she would actually give birth or fake a miscarriage for even more attention.

This resulted in frequent temper tantrums not unlike those of a 2 year old whenever we failed to accommodate the pregnant swamp rhino in our midst. Things like failure to offer her one of the few breakroom seats the minute she entered, were taken as personal slights. We were often accused of what could be called ""pregnant shaming"" in retrospect and being disrespectful of her 'conditions'.

But of course any attempts at having her grab you a Monster from the gas station or pick up a second lunch order were met with huffs of contempt and a hurried waddle to leave before a retort could be shouted.

As luck would have it though *she actually was pregnant*. Some eight and a half months of drama later she gave birth to a 10 lb son and gave him some super androgynous yet super feminine name that combined with his impending childhood obesity

She proceeded to disappear on 2 months of maternity leave

Eventually we got a new General Manager who spent a whole 2 weeks in the office before deciding he wanted her gone. He began looking for another branch office to unload her and luckily for him

That gave them both a legitimate reason to dump her and just like that she was gone forever.

**TL;DR:** Hamplanet coworker is so fat we couldn't tell she was pregnant until she actually brought the little bastard into work.

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention the cast! The first 2 months I was there she was wearing a cast on one leg. Due to her general clumsiness she fell in the parking lot and fractured her foot.

In my first year of University, 1 small kitchen and bathroom between us. Students are assigned rooms at random, so there's a good chance of being put with at least one awesome person.


I was put with three nice, arrogant sod. He rarely showered too.


When we moved in, he stood in the middle of his room eating an entire packet of Custard Creams ordering his mother where he wanted stuff. Weird huh...


On the first night out to get to know each other, in his words. Needless to say, the smell of unwashed armpit and rotting food did the opposite. On the way home, he claimed he could lift 300lbs and was stronger than any of us. We sort of laughed it off in a polite British sort of way...


Snacks. Oh god did he snack. Frequently he would leave out a 2 litre tub of ice cream to melt in the kitchen and empty 2 packets of crushed Oreos into it. He'd then smother the lot in chocolate sauce and chow down, served with a heap of chicken nuggets mixed with mayonaisse. Another creation was a large pizza, topped with chips, cheese, and kebab meat, smothered in mayo.


Of course, and his excretions sounded like a Harley starting up in a mud puddle. Not only did he use a roll of paper per poop and refuse to buy any more, he shat all up the toilet seat and on the tank. We confronted him but he refused to do it...until one day I caught him using a kitchen dishcloth to scrub his pebble-dashed leavings off.


After the first couple of months of the rest of us drinking and eating more than usual, when Fat Oreo butted in:

ME: fat shit...etc...etc...

FO: Yeah

...

ME

FO: NO NO NO! (wagging his finger at me)

FO: I've been eating to gain muscle. In fact

Awesome Stoner: Nah man. Pretty sure it's fat.

FO: I could have any of you in a fight.

AS (who's pretty scrawny): Not doubting that. Just saying I think you've got fat.

FO: Fuck you all. *stomps off to his room*


Since we were all pretty drunk and giving each other shit for putting on weight


He didn't appear much until room inspections. Ours all passed without a problem, shit stained underwear stuck to the floor, rotting unwashedness wherever you could see. The piece de resistance was a wet shart...*against the wall* by his bed. He had obviously slept next to this and not bothered to clean it off.

I'd like to say that I killed Ginger right at that moment. I'd like to say that I beat the shit out of her, and real life was not so exciting or gratifying. Also, Ginger weighed two hundred pounds more than me, and she could have pummeled me in a fight if I ever tried to deck her.

Eric did have to physically hold me back from hurling myself at Ginger after she'd thrown the USB flash drive (a little 4GB stick, but just like I'm not match for the alabaster pale, redheaded 400 pounds of terror standing in her Hello Kitty underwear in front of me, I was also easily held back by the 6 foot Nord. He dragged me away from Ginger- who I don't think was aware of how capable she was of annihilating me and was screaming in fear about how I was going to kill her- dragged me downstairs, and forced me into his car. Eric drove me to a nearby diner, trying to calm me down. It was only a little past 5am on a Sunday morning, so the diner was basically empty. I'd only slept four hours, and I'll forever owe him for it.

We went over my more realistic options. We could have called the police, my roommate stole something from me, but she gave it back in a really bitchy manner."" My paper was done already. I wouldn't have been taken seriously if I tried to report it.

I reckoned that Facebook would take it down if I reported it. Eric didn't know anything about the bed picture of me and Luke being seen by all my family and friends, waited for me to finish eating, and we drove home. I was only going to pick up stop just long enough to pick up some clothes and yell at Ginger at some more. I didn't want to stay home, so I was just going to go stay with a friend for a few days to cool down and regroup.

Ginger is nowhere to be seen when we get home, report the photo to Facebook real fast, and start packing. When I finish I go to find Eric to say goodbye and good luck staying here with just Ginger and him home, but I can't find him. Eric is not in the house. I didn't hear the garage door opening, so he can't have gone far... After a moment, I realize where he went. I run next door and sure enough, Eric and Luke are engaged in fisticuffs in Luke's living room. Ginger is sitting on the couch watching, not one of those Wal-mart 30 cent mini-pies

&gt;""Eric came over and punched Luke in the face because of me!""

She thinks they're fighting over her. The delusion actually hurts

&gt;""We're not dating! You were just a drunk fuck

Ginger cries at first. Then she gets angry and says Luke was a dick and a manwhore and she gave him her precious virginity, he genuinely does not know what the hell we're talking about. Luke then says he remembers Ginger playing around with his phone before he passed out. So it was Ginger who uploaded the photo.

Eric muttered a half-hearted apology to Luke. Luke told him to go fuck himself. Then he started begging us and his friend who was there to not tell anyone what happened. Because he didn't want to be known as a guy who banged fat chicks. I'm not even listening, but now? Bitch was going down.

I grab a seat and chat to the wee boy. He's adorable - making jokes, what I do. I chat with him about school - turns out he's super smart and is doing science classes above his age. He tells me he likes the red-head from Mythbusters and we have a giggle over that.

His sister comes back and starts to slap him. Like, and says ""you can tell my Mum if you like. She won't believe you"".

Mum comes back as the food arrives, I see mini-porklets pudgy wee paw shoot out and steal *all the food* of her brother's tray.

She wolfs it down in a few seconds. The Mum comes back, nothing like that, just replaces the food and buys the daughter a dessert.

Bear in mind that the daughter is sitting there with an XL EVM (an *adult sized meal* and a large frappe)

Said card shop sells Christmas ornaments. We had the premiere today and it goes on tomorrow as well.

My boss, went out per premiere tradition and bought all sorts of snacks for the customers coming today to get their ornaments: mini-muffins, mini-brownies, little cookies, triscuts, wheat thins, mini nilla wafers, four kinds in all: key lime, the amount we were expecting to go through before 3pm. We opened at 8am today. This story takes place at around 2:45pm.

We at the store are enjoying the bountiful business, it's a good day to be working.

Suddenly, stress-free walking humans at the store.

Enter the fatpack.

The fatpack consisted of four women: an older lady (herein called Grandmother), 40 or so, and what must have been her two daughters (referred to henceforth as Granddaughters 1 &amp;amp; 2), around ages 10 and 14, I guessed.

They came clomping into the store, spots the snack table, and with an inarticulate cry of delight, oozes over to grab a plate. Granddaughter #1 tugs at Mother's sleeve and says she's going over to the snacks. 

Mother's head turns so fast it was shocking to see that her head did not dangle limply from her body as she collapsed like a puppet

Mother trundles over to the table

The fatpack then wandered around the store for around half an hour

Eventually

""Well

Grandmother laughs and Granddaughters 1 &amp; 2 roll themselves to the table to gather the last of the snacks onto their plates before they waddle after Mother and Grandmother.
Boss heads to the table to straighten the snacks up. You see

It would seem I was able to do this task around six hours earlier than expected. Boss comes back to where I am standing by the register counter and beckons me over to her. I head over

""That family that just left ate *all* the refreshments

I gape at her. ""What? All of it?""

She nods and I walk over to the table. Sure enough, plates of mini-treats empty but for one little mini-muffin all by itself, spared by some divine intervention.

I am dumbfounded, still wearing a shocked expression.

With a resigned sigh, spoons, plates, baskets, bowls and plastic utensils. I am just stacking it all onto this shitty cart thing we have so I can take it to the back room and wash it all when I hear it.

The distinct wheezing, alone, beady eyes swiveling around shiftily, perhaps for signs of Grandmother or Granddaughters 1 &amp; 2. She approaches the table and gasps.

""Oh no!"" She says. ""What happened to all the food?!""

My jaw drops. It hits the floor, through the crust of the earth, through its asthenosphere, into the mantle, where it promptly is burned to a crisp (I am currently seeking a jaw donor). 

This woman and her fatty kids demolished the food table ad now she's actually asking *where it all went?*

Boss steps in and saves me from putting my stupid foot in my stupid mouth

""We've had such a busy day, I guess that we didn't have enough food to last the whole day.""

It's a reasonable excuse, however, Mother decides that I am simply headed to get more food, since I am obviously the bringer of nourishment for the XXXXL denomination of shoppers.
She catches me

""Do you keep the extra food back here

I try to stay calm, that most of my family members are partial hammies (not quite hamplanets yet, but most certainly not fit), and two, that I myself am, in fact, a former hamplanet.

""Ma'am, ""we don't have any extra food. We had a rush of customers this morning and they ate up all the food.""

Mother looks so depressed for a second that I almost feel bad for her. *Almost.*

""Oh, giving up surprisingly easily. ""I mean, if you're sure there aren't any extras...""

And then, onto the cart, and snatched up that one solo mini-muffin. She stuffed it into her mouth like she was Christian Bale with those worms in *Rescue Dawn.* 

""See?"" Mother says

&gt;one doctor has smart idea of making her shaped more like a semi-circle so some of the fat rolls can fit underneath the patient plate.

&gt;also makes ropes in middle very tight to push fat towards her legs/head.

&gt;patient begins to have breathing problems.

&gt;stop.

&gt;push all fat towards legs and away from chest.

&gt;try to fit her in MRI one last time.

&gt;she fits with some of her belly fat resting inferior to her shoes.

&gt;do MRI.

&gt;look at clock - it's home time already! hi-5 the doctor and walk outside.

&gt;see white van parked in handicapped space.

&gt;see gigantic man wedged up against steering wheel.

my face when george was stuck in the van the whole time.

&gt;Not be hamplanet, 5’5, 400lbs of ham

Near where I live there’s a wetland bird conservation area with a little café

I'm sitting on a bench with my dog
Dog thinks chips are rubbish and I should have got a steak.
Never mind dog it’s your dinnertime when we get home.

.

Hear screams in the distance

Insects fly away

Birds fly away

Delicious chips fly away

You know what time it is!

.

“YUH NOT FEEDING YUH DOG ENOUGH!”

The ham had a spherical appearance ^(ofc), and, most weirdly, grey skin. The overall effect was that the moon had come to earth on a day trip.

Slightly terrified but ever hopeful

“Oh no

“I CAN SEE ITS RIBS”

“Yes

“IT’S SHAMEFUL. YEH OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED. IT’S DOG ABUSE!”

“No she’s supposed to look like that because-”

“YEH I BET YUH GOT IT ON ONE OF THEM DIETS YOU SKINNY PEOPLE LIKE. THEY DON’T WORK YOU KNOW!”

“She eats a lot but she doesn’t-“

“DON’T MAKE EXCUSES YOU’RE A DOG ABUSER AND SHOULDN’T HAVE A DOG- LOOK IT’S AFRAID!”

At this point dog was cowering under the bench ^(because loud noises) as would I be if I thought it would do any good- the fear of being eaten and simultaneously crushed in the gravity well was causing a seriously beta response from me

“She’s afraid of you!”

“DON’T BE SILLY”

It was at this point the moon made the fatal error which allowed our escape- she reached down to a terrified dog.

Dog went crazy, barking, growling, teeth bared- the moon toppled backwards but caught itself on it’s stubs ^(I think they were once legs) and I pulled back on the leash with all my weight to prevent a law suit

“LOOK! IT’S SO HUNGRY IT TRIED TO EAT ME!”

All of my what

There's no reasoning with this

Dog and me stomp off home- leaving the moon to do whatever moons do on holiday.

I noticed [this](http://redd.it/1ffhl2) post yesterday and have seen a number of comments looking for a collection of stories and figured that it might be a good idea to consolidate a large number of them into one place. Below I have created a list of many of the series that we have seen over the past few months for your convenience.

Each series has a minimum of two stories regarding the same person / circumstance. If you notice any spelling mistakes, please let me know. Each title is either the exact same or a close equivalent of the author’s original title. I waded through over 500 submissions so if I missed any then they were beyond that.

Each series is in descending chronological order. In no particular order

I'm not a cruel mistress.  I would not leave my poor piglets alone too long after the last terrible story of jimmie-rustling sour pudding.  Here is part 5

&gt; Been about a week.

&gt; Saggy knows Feeder and I broke up because of her.

&gt; Triumphant grease rains down from the ceiling. 

&gt; I am in physical pain I am so annoyed.

&gt; Eating dinner in my room and doing some math homework when I hear her syrupy TEE-HEEs from the living room. 

&gt; She's being purposefully loud.

&gt; Somethin's up.

&gt; I'm not takin the bait.

Honestly in the back of my mind I was pretty sure I knew what was about to happen.

&gt; Avoid the front room as long as possible.

&gt; Run to put up dishes and grab water.

&gt; Yup

&gt; Saggy is there

&gt; Notsurprised.gif

&gt; You can have him.  Not interested in rapists.

&gt; Show zero emotion because I honestly didn't care.  They were both being pathetic and immature.

&gt; Place my dishes in the washer and grab my water.

&gt; After I'd gotten back to my room

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks

&gt; I lock my door.

&gt; ""Nope

&gt; Saggy is whining on the other side of the door for him to come back to her room for some drinks and *loooooove*.

&gt; **VOMIT.MP3**

**A Few Hours Later**

&gt; Yea

&gt; They were definitely drunk.

&gt; Ignore.exe

&gt; Doing my maths while they're in the kitchen.

&gt; Suddenly I can hear them fighting.  

&gt; [DIS GON BE GUD](http://i.imgur.com/Yk3iJvn.gif)

&gt; Straining to hear all the yelling and what's being said.  Catch my name, skinny, faggot.

&gt; All of a sudden I hear Saggy yell ""Ow stop

Now FPS

&gt; I grab that thing FPS.

&gt; I grab it and stomp down that hall.

&gt; I see Feeder yelling at Saggy and he's grabbing her arm flab and shaking her arm.  She's crying and trying to pull away.

&gt; Dis boy is clearly drunk and deranged.

&gt; I unleash the power of Odin with my metal ruler, arms, face, and yelling all the new profanities I'd learned over the past two months.

&gt; **""YOU DON'T FUCKING HIT WOMEN YOU FUCKING PISS GUZZLING PERVERTED TURD!  GET OUT OF MY HOUSE GET OUT GET OUT GET THE FUCK OUT I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU EVER COME BACK YOU FUCKING ANIMAL GET OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""**

&gt; Swinging at him the entire time, and shove him out.  

If he hadn't been wasted that scene probably would have turned out VERY differently.

&gt; Turn back to Saggy.

&gt; Her mascara is running all over her face.

&gt; ""YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT SAGGY-SUCKS!  I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!  JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY BODY AND UPSET THAT YOUR TREE-BRANCH BODY CAN'T HOLD ONTO A MAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN BEAT MINE UP ONCE HE CHOOSES ME!""

&gt; She lumbers away and slams her door.

&gt; I grab the bottle of vodka on the table

**TL;DR: FEEDER GETS HIS ASS WHOOPED BY YOURS TRUELY.  PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE INSTEAD.**

[The Training: Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d6l4z/retail_whale_the_training_part_2/)

The store I work at provides you with an hour lunch anytime you work longer than 7 hours. I generally finish my lunch about 10-15 minutes through the hour and just relax. I take what I consider to be normal lunch-y things, etc).

RW and I rarely have lunch at the same time, been a few occasions when I have seen her grazing on more than just swarms of krill.


The lunches she ""brings"" from home usually consists of frozen dinners. Two Hungry Man meals, and two boxes of Little Debbies.

She generally will have another bag of chips and box of Little Debbies for her snack during the course of the day

Sometimes I have an issue where I speak before my brain realizes it's a bad idea

The lunches where she eats out are the worst. 


&gt; Walkin' into work

&gt; Enter break room to put up coat and purse

&gt; Whale song from the break room

&gt; RW ""Haaaaaaaaaay Viza! You coming into work?""

&gt; ""Hey RW. Yeah. How's it going?""

&gt; ""Oh just on lunch break! I wish restaurants would make bigger portions. I never feel I'm getting enough food for my money.""

&gt; Until this point I had just been trying to get my shit put away and GTFO

&gt; Two large empty pizza boxes

&gt; Two large calzone boxes

&gt; Two giant ass hamburger boxes

&gt; Large order of cheese fries currently being snacked upon (nearly done though

&gt; This is where my brain decided to take a vacation

&gt; Blurt out ""Oh my god

&gt; Immediately realize what I said and feel like a dick

&gt; Get ready to apologize

&gt; RW ""I told you

&gt; The lip-smacky noises of her sucking the last globules of cheese off her fingers is enough to make me feel sick

&gt; RW ""What did you bring for lunch today?!""

&gt; ""Oh... nothing special. Sandwich

&gt; RW ""You can't survive off that! Your body is going to start eating your muscles! Not eating enough is *really* bad for you. Especially working at a job where you have to stand up 99% of the time on concrete floors

By this point, and eventually I just gave the fuck up.

I had also learned, solitary employee in the entire store that enjoys this woman's company. *Everyone* hates her.

&gt; ""I eat enough to feel full

&gt; RW ""Oh no

&gt; I'm pretty sure she's trying to talk me into becoming morbidly obese

&gt; There are no words that she will understand

&gt; I speak people

&gt; Effort long since abandoned

&gt; ""I gotta go clock in. See ya later.""

About 2 hours into my shift

&gt;RW returns with two 12 inch subs

&gt; RW sings one of her favorite songs

&gt; RW ""I looooooooove chicken bacon ranch subs. They even gave me extra ranch on the side for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee""

She has them fill up one of the soup cups with ranch. I'm pretty sure they give them to her for free because she's the reason the store is still open. She's paying your salary

Later on toward the end of her shift, chips, and candy. Piles and piles of it.

Ring up all this shit.

&gt; ""Stocking up the pantry

&gt; RW ""Oh

I honestly don't know why I asked her that. I should've expected it. I have long since given up on trying to speak to this woman about anything - including things that are work related (because she never does them anyway).

TL;DR - Retail Whale eats entire Italian restaurant, buys entire candy aisle for pre-dinner snack.

I've been reading stories like a fiend ever since I started reading a week ago! I've got a brand-spankin-new throwaway just so I can tell the hilarious story of my former hamplanet roommate: Saggy. If I get any formatting wrong or do something wrong let me know

&gt; be me 5 years ago about to be a Freshman in college, 18 years. I've always been a curvy girl, even when I was thinner. 

&gt; don't be my university

&gt; I'm super excited

&gt; IMGONNAMEETSOMANYPEOPLE!

&gt; IMGONNAHAVEALLTHEFRIENDS!

&gt; I get my roommate assignments. 

&gt; find both girls on FB. 

&gt; Dramagirl (named thus because she had the hilarious tendency to be super dramatic about everything) seems cool and looks a lot like my little sis, says she already talked to other roommie and she smokes too.

&gt; Oh lordy these heathens! What shall I do??? 

&gt; Find other roommie on FB

&gt; ""Hey! We have common ground!"" I say. ""My mom just happens to be a very successful interior designer and just happens to own her own business!""

&gt; Other girly seems impressed and can't wait to meet my mom on move-in day

**Fast-forward to move-in day**

&gt; I let myself into my new ground floor apartment

&gt; I am greeted with a horrible sight.

I won't go into all the things she did wrong, fake flowers over her tv and in the kitchen with horrendous Hawaiian colors that did NOT match the neon color pallete she chose and paintings of neon colors in ""straight"" lines that looked like a four year old painted them in her pre-K class. Guys, I am exaggerating VERY slightly. It was god-fucking-aweful.

&gt; Mom and I observe the room in horror.

&gt; thisisasinagainstnature.gif

&gt; Look down at the rickety old couch and beheld the horror

&gt; a boulder of Pilsbury Doughboys had decided to merge into their ultimate form

&gt; the boulder turned

&gt; mother weeps

&gt; a baby in the next apartment over starts to cry as this otherworldly mound of halitosis and pig slop turns to us and locks eyes with me.

&gt; look away in terror and notice a large tub of country crock butter in her lap

&gt; WITH A LARGE SPOON IN IT

&gt; I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

&gt; SHE WAS FUCKING EATING THE FAKE BUTTER STRAIGHT

&gt; my mother and I snap out of our terror coma and greet the blob. 

&gt; with enormous effort

&gt; she was about 350 lbs and 5'5""

&gt; her boobs just kinda...swing down

&gt; and fall

&gt; and fall

&gt; they reach her belly button

&gt; I am glomped

&gt; her finger nails are bright

&gt; they tear into my flesh and I start to bleed out

&gt; Saggy asks us if we like what she's done with the place

&gt; we mumble non-commitedly

&gt; ~~little~~ big miss doesn't like not getting the slew of compliments she was expecting

&gt; fishing for compliments engaged

&gt; mom does not give compliments if they are not deserved

&gt; Saggy uses pout

&gt; returns to her butter and watching her cartoons

&gt; I escape to the back of the apartment where I meet my other roommate and we immediately give each other a look that says ""oh God what is that thing sitting on the couch do we have to live with it???"" 

&gt; didwejustbecomebestfriends.gif

I move my stuff in

Next day

First dinner in my new apartment! I'm such a grown-up

Nuthinlikeparent-boughtgroceries.allthegoodstuff

I knew I was on a strict budget from now on

&gt; I knock on both my roommates' doors and tell them my plan. Both are exited about home-cooked salmon!

&gt; Go to the freezer to pull out the salmon.

&gt; Saggy had basically stuffed the entire freezer with frozen chicken nuggets, and frozen pizzas until there was barely enough room to shove my salmon and some chicken breasts I'd gotten.

&gt; Open the freezer

&gt; Almost half the stuff that had been in the freezer yesterday was gone.

&gt; holycrapwherediditallgo?

&gt; did she already eat ALL OF THAT FOOD? 

&gt; naiive little me could not compute

&gt; shake off the shock and look around for the salmon

&gt; salmon.404 NOT FOUND

&gt; chicken is also missing

&gt; Where'd my stuff go?

&gt; Go to Saggy and ask where most of the food in the freezer went and where's the salmon and chicken I had in there?

&gt; Saggy looks smug

&gt; ""You must've put it in my side of the freezer. I probably ate it on accident when I cooked dinner last night because I thought it was mine. Tee-Hee! Whoops! Hope you learned your lesson!""

&gt; I am flabbergasted

&gt; the injustice!!!!

&gt; ERROR ERROR

&gt; ""Saggy, not understanding that reason is beyond this creature. If she had been reasonable, she wouldn't have stolen my food.

&gt; There's PLENTY of room in the freezer Saggy-Sucks, and I get the bottom two shelves in the freezer since most of my stuff is frozen. I got to the apartment first so I get pick!

&gt; I literally had no idea how to react to this. I had never been so shocked and appalled in my life. I yelled about now no one gets dinner because she ate all of it and to next time ask me to make sure it wasn't her food

Dramagirl was pissed at the lost salmon dinner and yelled ""Thanks a lot fat-ass!"" 

&gt; We hear a Tee-Hee from the living room.

I got so many people saying they like the stories and I have nothing to do on the Fourth because of all the rain

&gt; Been in school for about a month and a half at this point.

&gt; Starting to meet people in classes.

&gt; One guy always sits behind me in Biology class

&gt; He starts taking a liking to me.

&gt; Just had bad breakup with 3 year high school sweetheart

&gt; After about 2 weeks of school

&gt; Can anyone say **REBOUND???**

&gt; Cause that's what this was.

&gt; He was really sweet, and studying for Bio with me.

&gt; Start to notice he's encouraging me to eat more than I want.

&gt; One might even say he's *pushy* about it.

&gt; Tell him I don't want to eat at **Insert Fried Food Restaurant Name Here** anymore because I don't want to gain weight.

&gt; He says that's exactly why he takes me to these restaurants

&gt; Me confused

&gt; Don't all guys like girls who are normal-sized and/or skinnier?  I do not lack in the boobs/butt department

&gt; He shows me the type of porn he likes

&gt; It's a chubster in just a bra and panties rubbing her stomach and eating a chocolate bar

&gt; **[EXCUSE ME WHAT](http://i.imgur.com/CZqzV.gif)**

&gt; Trying to be supportive and accepting, but I'll still try to make him happy however I can.

&gt; His name is now Feeder

&gt; Because that's what he was.

&gt; You can see where this is going.

&gt; Eventually get around to bringing him home for dinner.

&gt; Dem homecookedmeals

&gt; He had come over before for some night time rendezvous

&gt; Cooking dinner like a champ

&gt; In walks Saggy

&gt; ""Well well Saggy-Sucks

&gt; ""He's got some purty eyes!"" she says

&gt; I wish I could say my boyfriend stayed true to me and could not look at any woman that wasn't his.

&gt; I wish I could tell you he was disgusted by this grotesque sin against all things beautiful and charming.

&gt; I wish I could tell you he didn't [stare at her with his mouth open and drooling](http://i.imgur.com/sdLxH4l.gif).

&gt; I wish I could tell you Saggy didn't shoot me the most gloriously triumphant look I'd ever seen as she ~~sauntered~~ waddled into her room.

&gt; But I can't.  Because dis shit happened.

&gt; [Ya'll's faces after reading this.](http://i.imgur.com/JkOzKst.gif)

&gt; Boyfriend finally notices once Saggy is in her room.

&gt; Knows he's in trouble when he sees my face.

&gt; ""NO

**Fast-forward twenty minutes**

&gt; Saggy pops out of her room right as I'm dishing up our plates of delicious nutritious.

&gt; She's wearing booty shorts, and a flaming red thong that has been pulled UP UP UP into the largest wedgie ever.

&gt; Satan himself would be proud.

&gt; ""What're ya'll cooookin?"" she says

&gt; ""It's healthy Saggy, shoving peas into my angry face.

&gt; Feeder is transfixed.

&gt; Saggy grabs the chicken I'd cooked for him, chewing it as it slowly enters her face-cavern.

&gt; Feeder cannot look away.

&gt; [MFW](http://i.imgur.com/eBtrEVp.gif)

&gt; Take my plate to my room.

&gt; About 30 seconds or so later

&gt; ""Sorry

&gt; ""We've been dating for a month.  I'm not that attached to you.  Get out and don't come back.  Don't talk or sit next to me in Biology.""

&gt; Wha wha WHAAAA?

&gt; Where did that come from self?  I think.

&gt; Boyfriend uses cry!

&gt; It's - *sigh* - super effective...

&gt; We have a picnic dinner in my bedroom followed by sexytimes.

**The Next Day**

&gt; Wake up

&gt; ""Seeeeeeee Saggy-Sucks?  I told you what men like.  I TRIED to tell you you were just a skinny bitch and people only fuck you to help your self-esteem

&gt; Me pissed

&gt; ""Yes Saggy

&gt; Stomp away as Saggy screeches after me about Feeder and that he's going to leave me for her because she's a real woman who knows how to please a man and won't stab him with her bones when they make love.

&gt; Don't really think this guy is worth this.

&gt; Break up with him the next day.

&gt; He cries again, I don't need a boyfriend this bad.  

&gt; He gets obstinate.

&gt; Uh oh....

&gt; Starts raging out.  Glad we're in a public place.

&gt; Whispers he's going to rape me so I realize what I'm trying to give up.

&gt; **OH HELL NOPE.**

&gt; Tell him he just crossed the line and that I don't ever want to see him ever again or I would call the cops.  

&gt; Literally run out of whatever food place we were at.

&gt; Go home and tell Dramagirl all the things.

&gt; She thinks I should've caused a scene so that he'd get beat up.

&gt; Hindsight is 20/20.

&gt; Saggy wins for now.

&gt; No more rebounds for me.

Saggy got more money from her mommy

We found out she got money because she paraded into the living room one day in a barely-there tank top (breast meat sagging to her belly button despite the valiant efforts of the straps) flashing her back folds at us.

&gt; ""Saggy how did you get a tattoo if you can barely afford all the food you eat?"" Dramagirl said

&gt; Saggy jiggled her rose around in glee.

&gt; ""I just wanted something for me since I never really treat myself to anything! I'll just make momma give me more money when I need food. She can't let me starve!""

&gt; Dramagirl and I are at a loss.

&gt; This selfish bitch is for real.

&gt; See later that day she has new acrylic nails with sparkles and neon colors.

&gt; ""Saggy those things are disgusting

&gt; Saggy huffs and brandishes her claws

&gt; ""I must be pretty fucking beautiful then

&gt; Saggy started screaming and thrashing about in anger, arms, and face, making little scratches (and her arm even bled a tiny bit).

&gt; She glared at Dramagirl with a conniving

&gt; ""Look at all the scratches you left on me Dramagirl! I've been letting the apartment know about how insulting, and VIOLENT you've been to me over the past few months. I told them you threw out my food and you've been threatening to hurt me constantly. Now I have proof that you did! I'm gonna go call the cops now. You better run for your fucking life, because it's over you bitch.

&gt; Oh my fucking God you have to be kidding me.

&gt; That conniving sphere beat us at our own game.

&gt; For once Dramagirl didn't have a quip as Saggy stomped to her room to call the police. She started shaking and crying and asking me ""what am I gonna do Saggy-Sucks?! I didn't do anything but insult her but she has scratches all over her and they're gonna believe her because she's been talking to the apartment people WHATAMIGONNADO????""

&gt; I grab her by the shoulders and shake her a little. ""Calm down

&gt; Her eyes get wide. She hadn't even thought about the pot. 

&gt; She runs to her room and I wait for the police. Saggy joins me after a while

&gt; After a while we hear a knock.

&gt; Saggy waddles forward

&gt; ""We got a call about a domestic dispute?"" The two cops say

&gt; One of them asks me where Dramagirl is

&gt; Saggy puts on an act. Honestly if she wasn't so over-dramatic and obviously exaggerating

She starts getting upset

&gt; I'm just standing there

&gt; The officer asks me if it's true

&gt; I calmly told him no, we only make fun of her because pretty much everything she's accusing Dramagirl and me of is stuff SHE ACTUALLY DID, and she scratched herself. There was probably still skin underneath her talons (tee-hee, I actually said talons to the officer) and he should probably check so he realizes what a lier Saggy is.

&gt; Saggy looks smug and I swear to God there were little demons behind her shoulder mountains trumpeting a triumphant song for her.

&gt; She thrusts her claws into the po-po's face with a grin and says ""check if you like

&gt; The bitch cleaned the evidence from underneath her fingernails.

&gt; I forgot all she did was watch TV all day

&gt; The second police officer and Dramagirl walk into the living room. Cop number two says he's got Dramagirl's statement

&gt; I panic.

&gt; ""Dramagirl can't stay here? That's not fair! Saggy's lying! I don't want to be here alone with her

&gt; They genuinely looked sorry...

&gt; ""Ma'am

&gt; Saggy is practically oozing joy as Dramagirl packs a bag really quick so she can stay with her boyfriend.

&gt; As Dramagirl is escorted out with the cops

&gt; ""Take that you skinny twat

&gt; Dramagirl could only hang her tear-streaked face in shame as the apartment door closed behind her.

**TL;DR: SAGGY WINS FOR NOW BY CALLING THE POLICE AND BEING A LYING SACK OF SHIT.""**

1366930109.0,1d45so,Retail Whale: The Training Part 1,VizaMotherFucker,801,202,97,"I have more stories of this woman than I care to admit to myself. I'll make them separate posts so I don't overload you with fury all at once.

Over a year ago, because holy shit, not working made me crazy and fat. Got up to at least 170+ lbs at 5'4. I tend to gain weight fairly evenly, so I really didn't look terrible.

My fifth day on the job was training for my Customer Service position (ie - Get yelled at by fatties all day erryday). Enter my trainer: The Retail Whale (RW for short).

This woman is about 5'11 and 450 lbs (For my other country people that's 180 cm, gnarled with constant food bits stuck in them. Her hair is always a greasy, stringy mess. And I swear to any god you believe in she has a fucking beard.

She wears makeup that is more well suited to a clown than a human being and constantly has lipstick on her brown

Onwards and upwards

&gt; New job fuck yeah!

&gt; Not sitting on my ass playing WoW all day fuck yeah!

&gt; Gonna train so fuckin' hard and be awesome at everything!

&gt; Habitually early for everything

&gt; Earthquake, etc. You know the drill.

&gt; Out of breath from the 50 ft walk to the parking lot

&gt; *Wheeze* ""Hey

&gt; Slap on that fake smile and let's do this

&gt; ""Yeah! Nice to meet you. I look forward to working together.""

&gt; RW is sucking down a McD's sweet tea that is nearly the size of her head

&gt; RW: ""Just let me put my things up and I'll be right back.""

&gt; THIRTY FUCKING MINUTES LATER She finally shows up.

&gt; The woman we were to be relieving has been chatting with me during the interim

&gt; ""You're really going to have to keep RW in line tonight. Just try not to get too frustrated with her. She means well.""

&gt; New employee keeping 20+ year veteran in line? All my wat.

&gt; No time to explain as RW reemerges from the depths

The first hour or so was extremely uneventful. Went over basic computer functions

&gt; Customer comes in for refund

&gt; No receipt

&gt; Typin' that shit in like a girl who has been on the computer for too many years

&gt; RW ""You type too fast because your fingers are too skinny.""

&gt; Try to laugh it off ""Haha

&gt; RW ""Women don't need to learn how to type or do computer things. We just need to be pretty for our men.""

&gt; SOUTHERN LOGIC

(Short aside - I am extremely nontraditional and I curse like a fucking sailor when not at work. That whole women in the kitchen thing is a bunch of bullshit. My husband cooks because he enjoys it. I burn everything and it upsets me to waste food. Continuing on!)

&gt; Finishing up transaction

&gt; ""Yeah

&gt; RW looks startled

&gt; I glance around to see if there is a larger whale encroaching her territory or bag of doughnuts

&gt; All clear!

&gt; ""Oh honey

&gt; Before I could even respond she fucking pinched my side fat

&gt; You ever seen a really pissed off cat with its ears laid back? MFW

&gt; ""I don't like being touched. Please don't touch me.""

&gt; RW let's out a boisterous whaley laugh

&gt; Straight up eye tics at this point

&gt; ""I don't mind it when people I like touch me

&gt; RW looks like I just stole the last piece of her favorite cake

&gt; RW ""I need to go finish working on the schedule. You'll be okay by yourself for a little bit

&gt; ""Sure

At this point I do feel a little bad for being snappy at her. Just a little. That ended within the two hours that she left me alone. She was sitting (I shit you not) 10 ft away and could not be bothered to get up to come help me. ""Just call a manager."" The ""Schedule"" she was working on was a bag of powdered doughnuts that she bought before her shift.

In the two hour span that she was sitting on her fat ass, bought a two liter of Dr Pepper, finished that, bought TWO BOXES of Little Debbie cakes and finished those as well.

TL:DR - Grabby fatty all up in my business and weight. Hurt her feelings so she gorges herself on food for two hours.

Part Two will likely be posted tomorrow.

This story is from a couple of days ago when I returned home from being at my parents for a week with cuteguy, other housemates, everyone! They all had some kind of flu virus  and feeling a bit rundown. Since AS was the only one who managed to avoid it for whatever reason we decided one evening that we would cook a meal for ourselves, KK, and two other housemates. PorkPlanet is automatically never included in house meals because she never eats it anyway and always makes her own (gross) food, or orders takeaway. 

&gt; Be cooking food with AS

&gt; Yum yum, dat couscous, dat salad.

&gt; Me: ""Some chicken and veg in the oven

&gt; Porkplanet scrunches her face up 

&gt; AS: ""Healthy food. Stuff that will make you feel better"".

&gt;  Porkplanet: ""So can I have some?""

&gt; AS: ""Thought you told me earlier you were going to get some Chinese food?""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I just don't feel well to drive.""

&gt; Me: ""Of course you can have some. I was gonna use the leftover chicken breast for my lunch tomorrow but you can have it. We'll let you know when it's ready"".

&gt; Porkplanet exits. 

&gt; AS: ""I don't think I've ever seen her eat a healthy meal like this in three years I've known her"". 

&gt; Me: ""Perhaps she's turning a corner?"" 

&gt; AS: (scoffs) ""She's just too lazy to get her own food. Or she's broke."".

&gt; Me: ""Let's just ignore and not make a big deal out of it and maybe she'll enjoy it. She'll put on a scene if she thinks we're making a big deal out of her eating healthy food"". 

20 minutes later. 

&gt; KK enters kitchen. Counts plates served up. 

&gt; KK: ""Ooooh

&gt; Me: ""Porkplanet!""

&gt; AS: ""Yeah

&gt; KK: ""Fuck me. If she turns a corner too quickly and changes her eating habits

&gt; [OFW KK](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsi8yhGVqG1qjwst6.gif) comes out with the funniest shit sometimes. 

Porkplanet and other housemates eventually enter. We all sit and eat. Everyone must be real sick still because we mostly eat in peace and quiet for 15 minutes. 

&gt; [AS's face when](http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l594/xCeeh/tumblr_llufhjpJSq1qf7rph.gif) PorkPlanet puts Regae Regae sauce with her chicken

&gt; We all finish. Clean up. Put our plates in the dishwasher. 

&gt; Porkplanet fishes £2 out of her purse. Puts it in the house food jar.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""That was very lovely. I'm full. Thank you"". She exits to her room. 

&gt; [OFW](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/9/94/Oprah_shocked.gif) we're still in shock she ate healthy food without complaint or protest. 

*Sidenote: The food jar is where everyone pays/chips in for house meals. Usually about £1.50 each for whoever eats.*

Two hours later. 

&gt; Go to bathroom

&gt; Hear giggling and rustling. 

&gt; Knock and pop my head in to see what she's up to. 

&gt; She's sat on the bed watching The Big Bang Theory. 

&gt; Me: ""Hey

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Yes the chicken was lovely. I'm full!"". 

&gt; Me: ""Cool. We're probably gonna have something again tomorrow night. Maybe Salmon or Tuna Pasta.""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ok I'll eat with you I'll pop some more money in the Jar tomorrow and help cook"". 

&gt; Go to sit on her bed. 

&gt; Me: ""You've changed your tune with food then?"" 

&gt; Porkplanet: Sigh ""Yeah. I'm just not feeling like takeaways and all the crap at the moment"".

&gt; Me: ""That's good. I lost so much weight eating that stuff. It can become boring sometimes if you eat the same stuff so I try and change it up and cook different things with AS

So as the days went by, entitled, cussed at everyone for no reason, and was an ENORMOUS slut. Her man of choice? Scummy black guys - who happened to be in abundance at this particular apartment complex. Over the next year we were roommates, she apparently slept with every single black guy and almost every single other guy in our ENTIRE APARTMENT COMPLEX. Read: anyone that would have her. The girls in our apartment fucking hated her because she would sleep with their boyfriends. But this will all be expounded upon soon enough. For now, I shall tell you about her breaking the pot rule and my first run-in with one of her ""boyfriends.""

&gt; Be biking back from class (didn't have a car so I biked everywhere).

This is a good time to tell you that I have a VERY poor sense of smell. I usually can only smell very distinct and vivid things like cinnamon, Axe, etc. Usually body odor is something I can't smell. I commonly can't tell the difference between a ""bad"" smell and a ""good"" smell. If Saggy had a funk, I couldn't tell ya. 

&gt; But oh lord jesus when I opened that door...

&gt; It was like a tsunami of sensation

&gt; My poor

&gt; What are these smells? Do not understand.

&gt; While all this nose weirdness was going on, and smashed all the pinatas in her room. There was garbage EVERYWHERE and - wait, are those my plates? And that's definitely one of my mom's nice cups she gave me with her company logo on it. Why is her room covered with my dishes? And HEY. THAT'S WHERE MY CEREAL WENT. Nope - empty. And those are the poptarts I never opened...forgot I even bought those. And the chips...and the nice crackers mom got me at the beginning of the year.....

&gt; I just kept looking. Every corner I looked in had something that belonged to me in it. Food, and even some of the acrylic paint I had had to replace because I'd thought a fellow classmate had stolen it. I'd complained to the teacher and everything.

&gt; I gather my dishes and paints and bring them into the kitchen. Just a minute later

&gt; You're cornered bitch

&gt; It looks like your dirty dishes. Don't fucking leave them in the sink for me to clean again

&gt; ""Saggy, AND MY PAINT. I NEEDED THAT FOR A PROJECT AND YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE PEOPLE'S THINGS WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU FREAKING CLEAN **ANYTHING**???""

&gt; I take one of my kitchen knifes and lunge at Saggy as she's about to make an excuse about how she needs my food for her beetus and blood sugah. I scream my battle cry ""YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE YOU CRETINOUS CREAM PUFF"" and stab her multiple times in her saggy boobs as she cries and wails ""OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE I DESERVE THIS JUST PUNISHMENT."" She falls

&gt; Yea right this is real life not our fantasies.

&gt; Saggy slams her keys down onto the table.

&gt; ""WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM?? I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING YOU SKINNY TWAT! DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH MY THINGS OR EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING INTO MY ROOM AGAIN OR I'LL HAVE YOU KICKED OUT OF THIS APARTMENT SO FAST IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN!""

&gt; I scream at her to keep her fat face away from my food as she stomps to her room

&gt; I open all of the cabinets with my things in them and move everything to my room: dishes, pots, pans, and of course, all my food. There was only healthy stuff in the fridge at the moment, so I left it there until I could get a fridge cage. I washed everything she had sullied and brought that back to my room as well.

&gt; Texted Dramagirl and told her what had happened and that I was gonna move her stuff to her room for her. 

&gt; Dramagirl agrees and thanks me whilst demanding the full story when she got home.

So, I've had a little success, but I'm not going to go out giving unsolicited advice. If someone asks, sure! I'll tell them what's worked for me, but I'm not going to be that dude who is saying, ""Well, what you need to do..."" because it's not my life

So, ""Astraeus47 *huff, wheeze* what are you doin' for lunch?""

""Huh, combined with the 4 liters of soda a day, are exacerbating the situation.

I decide to give in just to get away from the sweaty beast. There is no winning this battle. I can only hope that they choose someplace with decent options. Regardless

""No, it is highly inappropriate. I have been fat my entire life, and for the first time since I can remember, I am finally getting to a point where I can *see* who I was meant to be. I can *see* the man that I always was. My wife looks at me in ways I've never seen before. I can walk up stairs without getting winded. I can buy clothes off the rack from a place without 'Big and Tall' in the name. That is a feeling unlike any other, and I will not let you berate me for that. I would normally wait until we got behind closed doors for this next part, but since you've seen fit to bring half the office in on it, I figure we might as well go whole hog while we're here... Although I may not have been here for very long, but this seems like the one time I'm going to have to. Don't make comments about my weight or fitness levels again. Or if you want to, but there are about a million better ways you could have done this. If anyone wants to talk

I stood up, ""And then a few people wanted advice!"" but... nothing. I still workout at lunch, and none of the herd really talks to me much about anything other than work. And you know, that's fine.

I had a lot of fun typing that up last night

To recap, and Ginger's family was bringing in all of her things for her while Ginger sat in the living room, snacking on several Hershey bars and playing the Sims on her laptop. In an unrelated note, Ginger really got me into the Sims. I wasted hours on that shit.

I was putting up liners in the kitchen cabinets when Ginger's family left. They'd brought in her bed, most of the heavier stuff while Ginger had sat on her colossal ass, but aside from that they left most of the boxes for Ginger to unpack. I could hear Ginger complaining about this to her parents. ""You can't leave! There's still a lot to be done! Mama, you know how tired I get when I don't lay down!"" Good grief. Ginger's mother tells her that they have a long drive back home and that they'd done the most of the grunt work. ""Maybe you could get your nice roommates to help you."" Fat (see what I did there?) fucking chance.

Ginger comes into the kitchen of course, you're not a very Christian person,"" whatever the fuck that means, and goes upstairs and pleads with Yuri. Yuri, who is exponentially more outspoken than I am, tells her to deal with it and that maybe she'll burn off some calories if she does some actual work. Ginger immediately gets irate. ""You don't know what I go through! My condition makes me extremely tired! This is just the treatment I'd expect from someone like you!"" Ugh. This was only the first day.

Ginger waddles back downstairs- apparently walking up the stairs has made her ravenous, she would place another one into the microwave. In the three minutes it took for each frozen monstrosity to cook, Ginger would eat and lick clean whatever she'd just taken out. I counted seven of these microwave trays. I was horrified, and yet too fascinated to look away.

Not surprisingly, already feeling for the poor toilet. A few minutes pass. The walls are relatively thin in our new apartment. Then I grimace, hearing grunting sounds. Good God. I could could feel bile rising up my throat. Ginger was not even trying to muffle the sounds she was making. ""Ah! Ah-ah-ah! Ah!"" It was one of the worst things I ever heard, and no this was not a one-time thing. Ginger, we'd soon find out, was regularly constipated. Yuri texted me from upstairs. ""Is this really happening?""

Ginger finally stops grunting, it does not go down. Ginger does not take the hint and flushes again and again. This is apparently a very exhausting experience for Ginger. Ginger comes out of the bathroom, not looking concerned in the least. The smell of feces hung in the air. She goes back to the living room and goes back to her laptop. Believe you me, I was listening, and I did not hear any hands being washed in the sink.

""Hey Ginger?"" I have to ask. ""What did you do?"" Ginger sighs like I'm being difficult, I ask her to fix it. She's not the only one who's going to be using that bathroom, I remind her. She's sharing it with Eric, and Eric won't be happy to come home from work and find a clogged toilet. Ginger rolls her eyes. ""Always thinking about Eric, right? You're so obvious."" It's about being a decent human being, you cunt! I did not say this, though I wish I did. I get Yuri to talk to her though. And by talk to her, and demands that she fix the toilet and clean the bathroom. Ginger looks like she wants to cry. She frantically calls her mother

We take some pity on Ginger and Yuri and I walk to the store to buy a plunger and air freshener while she boils a pot of hot water. Part of the reason we wanted to get away was also the smell. It had spread throughout the house. Yuri and I take our time walking back and grab some lunch. When we got back to the apartment,"" was wondering what that godawful smell was. Yuri and I are embarassed, show him the plunger, and explained our situation with Ginger. Shirtless Hottie expresses his sympathies and asks us to hang out. After dropping the toilet plunger off with Ginger, Yuri and I say fuck it to unpacking for the day, escape next door and play video games with Shirtless Hottie, who actually does wear a shirt sometimes and will now be known as ""Luke."" Luke is a student like us. We actually started dating not long after

Then, still holding that fucking plunger in one hand. If Luke wasn't built like a football player, I really think Ginger would have taken him down. Luke is taken aback and grossed out. He coughs a bit from the smell of her and the smell from the plunger. Ginger then leaves to get back with the plunging, but promises Luke that she'll be back for him. She winks several times at him. Luke looks like he regrets everything.

Mercifully, but what do we find when get back? Chips all over the carpet. Candy wrappers. Three empty pizza boxes. What the hell? We find Ginger in her room. She's laying down on her mattress. Her laptop is on her stomach. Her boxes are still not unpacked. What the hell? ""I was just really tired after all I fixed that toilet for you guys. You're welcome, by the way"" EXCUSE ME? Eyeballs are about to explode. Yuri doesn't even want to look at her, and just goes to hide in our bedroom. He's so angry he's shaking. We've all had enough of this girl. Trying to still be nice, I ask her to pick up after herself. Ginger does not get it. ""I've been working all day, can't you people do something for once?"" I want to strangle this girl.

When Eric gets home, lunch sounds fun!"" Ginger says, coming out from behind us. She starts listing the restaurants nearby, which is weird because she just moved here and shouldn't already know the names and specialties of these places by heart. Ginger nudges Eric a few times while mentioning the more ""romantic"" ones. We'd all actually planned for a roommate dinner, but after everything we'd gone through today with Ginger none of us were in the mood to eat. Except for Ginger, of course.

Eric says something about saving a cat stuck in a tree and goes to hide in his room. Ginger turns to me, I ask her to repeat herself. ""Lulu, you're such a tryhard. You're losing all this weight and chasing after Eric and Luke. It's so sad. You don't have to act like a whore just because you're skinny. Men like that will always want a real woman, no matter how much you throw yourselves at them. If you'd just try to change the way you looked and didn't worry so much about dieting, you could probably get a man in a real respectable manner."" Then she added. ""Yuri's probably so used to women looking like you, and that's why he doesn't think he can be attracted to girls.""

I grew up in a conservative Republican household. My parents are gun-toting, card-carrying NRA members from East Texas. They were not as small-minded as this frizzy mess of white trash blubber in front of me. I alpha up, just for a bit.

&gt; RW ""Look at our rings!"" ""Do you like my hair!"" ""My wedding was soooo amazing.""

&gt; Me ""I'm glad that you're happy!"" while contemplating the glorious fallout that is to come

&gt; Because I'm a terrible person

Is expounded a pun in FPS? It fucking should be.

&gt; RW ""Why are you wearing long sleeves in May! You have to be roasting in here!""

&gt; Me ""It was 47 when I came in at 2pm

&gt; RW gives a mighty chuckle, you'd have some meat on your bones and wouldn't feel chilled all the time.""

Yep. Finally told me I have an eating disorder. 130lbs at 5'4 and I have an eating disorder. I normally feel warm or uncomfortably hot in any environment (which is why I *love* winter, I'm anorexic.

Bitch please.

&gt; Me ""Your total is 89.95.""

&gt; Jonah-husband pays the total

&gt; I give absolutely no shits because I would rather see their marriage explode than I lose my job

&gt; Quietly shake my head as I'm being fat and thin shamed at the *same fucking time*

I can't wait to see what happens after the honeymoon! Whee...

**Side note**: I've gotten a few PMs from people telling me that I'm being too passive and a pushover when RW says shit like this to me. I have worked with this woman for nearly a year and a half now. Saying things to her does no good. Saying things to my managers does no good. I can't get her fired

I work at this shitty store to make a paycheck. At this point

My crew gets there and we knock. Door opens and I start to cry a little from how terrible the stench is. Like ammonia from cat piss

The woman lets me in. I find out she is the mother of the Beast that has a lair upstairs. It's the Beast's apartment

First of all, but still nice a creamy on the inside. Cat shit is for me a particularly revolting oder so I started to gag while smearing cat shit around the living room. There was so much it was unavoidable. 

I go outside to finish dry heaving and radio my boss. I tell him this one is a no-go, after trying hard to get out of it, I reluctantly follow his orders but I tell him he has to send an extra crew to make the job go by faster. 

So I continue with my walk through and must go upstairs. It was like I was entering a different climate

Get upstairs and The Beast is laying in her bed. Easily 450 pounds. The bed had long since succumbed to her fat ass and there was a large depression where she laid. There were fast food bags and pizza boxes all over the place. I could taste the room in the back of my throat. 

Nothing was packed and everything had a shiny glistening coat of grease or whatever had accumulated for who knows how long. I got the fuck out of there and waited for the second crew to show up. I'm the driver but all the crews are brothas. They were revolted too but laughing when the 2nd crew came

Anyway

I just have them start bringing me shit. Everything stinks. I start loading it. The brothas come back sicker and sicker every time. The bed comes out and there are shit and blood stains all over it. I throw up. Brothas laughing at me as they throw up too. 
Under the bed they found used tampons, filthy plates. 
The bathroom was a fucking door to hell. Shit all over the toilet. There was no fucking way the Beast could wipe her own ass. I know because most of the shit was on the seat and floor. 

When it comes time to deliver in a different state

We start unloading her shit into a trailer. There is no where to sit and she starts complaining that she needs a chair to kill. She says she can't sit on the floor because she won't be able to get up and god knows even me and my co-worker can't get her up.

As some kind of payback, you ruined my trip. Boss had a lot of explaining to do to the other customers. I got no tip for that whole haul. Fuck you Beast for living in your own refuse.

&gt; Be the day after I take all of Dramagirl's and my dishes/groceries/kitchenware from the kitchen and keep it locked in our rooms.  I'm pretty sure it was the weekend

&gt; Lol, it taught me to plan for unforeseen circumstances (like Saggy stealing my food) and how to budget like a normal adult.  Saggy got money from her mom and student aid every month and Dramagirl and I quickly found out she would spend almost all of it the first week.

&gt; ""My parents don't pay for my stuff Saggy

&gt; ""Mind your own DAMN business you fucking whore!"" Saggy shouts and starts pounding on the door again.

&gt; GIVE ME A GOD-DAMN BOWL I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ALL NIGHT AND MY BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU SKANKS ARE GOING TO SEND ME INTO A COMA!""

&gt; She continues to shout and whine

&gt; Saggy eventually stomps off

**A WEEK OR TWO LATER**

I'd introduced Dramagirl to Eddie at this point so she could corroborate my stories about Saggie, I liked Orange Box and she was playing those with me) and some Saggy-watching.

&gt; So we're at the apartment chilling and throwing grenades at each other.  Eddie was on my team and we were still getting our tooshies whooped by Dramagirl.  She was a beast!

&gt; Then the tv goes all static-y

&gt; Dramagirl's complaints were cut short when we feel a rumble from the other side of the wall (where Saggy's room was).

&gt; **STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP**

&gt; After a few moments of earthquake rumbles, with her massive cracks attacking our faces.

 &gt; She yawns

&gt; Our game is forgotten

&gt; Saggy's face lights up and she bobs her mountain of a hip to the side.

&gt; ""Well heyyyyyy boyyyyy

&gt; ""Just playing halo with Saggy-Sucks and Dramagirl!"" he says in a polite tone. ""My name is Edward,"" he gets up and offers his hand for a shake.  Saggy looks taken aback but grabs his hand with her fake-nailed claw.

&gt; ""Oh you're mr. manners aren't ya?"" she said

&gt; She pulls out one of her huge boxes of chicken nuggets, bacon, eggs, grits, and cheese.

&gt; ""I'm makin breakfast **Edward** you want momma to feed you?"" she said

&gt; Eddie's composure was made of diamond

&gt; ""No thank you

&gt; ""Honey you gotta let women feed you!  It's only polite!  I'm gonna show you how a real lady treats her man

&gt; We all played halo

&gt; After a while, eggs, 5 pieces of toast, a glomp of mashed potatoes and a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal next to it.  She had a two plates for herself and a bowl of cereal since she gave the ""platter"" to him.

&gt; ""Now that's a providin' woman!"" she says

&gt; Eddie said thanks, talking about how he would ""never keep all dem muscles if he didn't eat big!"" *then ate pretty much everything that he'd left over as well as her two plates and bowl of cereal.*

Over the course of the next hour, trying to ""sexy talk"", and making hints that her bedroom was RIGHT THERE and she was ""a master at pleasing the males in her life.""  *vomit*

Eddie was calm and polite, yes, he dressed like this everyday, and no, he was not the LEAST bit gangster. She was trying to tell him his clothes didn't really work for him and even went so far as to plop her gigantic bottom in his lap.  This was the only time he lost his cool.

&gt; ""OW!!!  Hey

&gt; Oooooops

&gt; **volcanic eruption impending**

&gt; **EVACUATE**

&gt; ""EXCUUUUUSE ME?  TOO BIG?  HONEY I'M THE PERFECT SIZE

&gt; Dramagirl and I are outright rolling on the floor laughing at this point

&gt; Saggy HATES that she's not being taken seriously

&gt; Our faces are like [0__________0](http://imgur.com/WapLIRo)

&gt; She stomps away and slams her door.

&gt; ""I don't think she likes you Eddie

&gt; We all laugh.

&gt; Saggy only likes thuggy blacks

&gt; Eddie is immune to the whalesong

There was much rejoicing.

Until we realized she'd left her dishes all over the living room again.

TL;DR Muh Muh returns

Sorry my dearest hammies
When we last left [Muh Muh in Part I]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/) (read for reference, a night that was dark and full of terrors:

&gt;Be me


&gt;Be crouching behind a display of oranges


&gt;The cart (dubbed by the store employees as a big amigo


&gt;The cart begins stopping and starting


&gt;Daughtermoon is leaning on the seat


&gt;Muh muh


&gt;Daughtermoon is unfazed


&gt;Daughtermoon whines that her legs are tired


&gt;Muh muh is wheezing again, her eyes looking opposite ways and towards the ground


&gt;Muh muh looks like a crazy person


&gt;”GIT MUH MUH A DRINK MUH MUH’S THURSTY” she says to Daughtermoon


&gt;Muh muh chugs the liquid


&gt;”HURRY UHP!” shouts Muh Muh as Daughtermoon fumbles in the massive tote


&gt;Daughtermoon procures as “sticker” (a vial of insulin with a needle attached), injecting the entire vial

I knew this was insulin, actually.


&gt;Muh muh takes a breather—riding all of 20 feet in the cart, but she recovers after a time


&gt;45 minutes has elapsed


&gt;Ignoring her mother’s warning


&gt;The back tires are scraping the wheel well


&gt;I move behind an end cap to continue my observation


&gt;Late night shoppers
the aisle


&gt;The expressions turn from disbelief to disgust as they take in all that is Muh Muh


&gt;Once again irritated with the slowness of her movement


&gt;I hear the cry of a young baby coming from the bundle of dirty blankets in big amigo’s basket


&gt;”DAUGHTERMOON GIT OFF’IN MY GAWDDAMN CART UHND GIT DAT BABY OUT DERR TOO DAT CRY BE WURKIN’ ON MUH NERVES UH 
SWURR TUH FUCKIN GAWD!”


&gt;Daughtermoon begrudgingly obeys


&gt;Muh Muh gives her a sharp rap on the back of her head as Daughtermoon walks away with the baby and obscenely heavy tote (filled with several more liters of pop


&gt;My mind, I reason, that that thing came out of that disgusting, beetus-crusted vageen


&gt;But, for, unbeknownst to me, the stars were in a perfect alignment that dark, stormy night


&gt;Muh Muh senses her goal is now attainable


&gt;Without Daughtermoon


&gt;Her head rolls to the side


&gt;The cart


&gt;I know what’s about to happen

In order to understand what happens next, for you Southerners) while the lefts is wine and craft beers. The opposite side of the left unit is all hard liquor. Unlike the rest of the aisles in the store, which continue maybe 50ish feet in a solid line, the left side with the booze is split halfway through and there is a gap that splits the double sided shelf units into two sections. Since that likely made no sense, [I painted a diagram for you all](http://i.imgur.com/tlpiPg2.jpg). Yes, I am an artist.

Inside this split are two displays of wine, decorative wooden crates made out of flimsy wood. These crates were stacked on their sides with the wine displayed within. They are stacked three wide, and about five high—the highest at about to eye level for the average person. You might see where this is going…

&gt;It all happened so fast


&gt;Momentum = mass x velocity


&gt;With such unfathomable momentum


&gt;The cheap wood was splintered without discrimination


&gt;Upon impact


&gt;My vision was filled by a cascade of red wine bottles falling everywhere


&gt;They bounced off Muh Muh


&gt;Droplets of wine floated through the air


&gt;They sparkled under the fluorescent lights


&gt;After a minute


&gt;The clamor temporarily snapped Muh Muh into consciousness once again, she decided it was time to hightail it out of there


&gt;Dropping big amigo into reverse


&gt;With a mechanical roar of frustration at his unsuccessful initial attempt at killing the beast


&gt;The second display of wine is thereupon obliterated similarly to its counterpart


&gt;Wine bottles showered the floor once again


&gt;I see from all angles


&gt;The few wine bottles somehow surviving the fall roll along the floor


&gt;My manager (Ms. Bitchy Blonde) suddenly skids into sight at the opposite end of the aisle


&gt;”What—I… how?!” she stammers to no one in particular


&gt;As the entire grocery department is now clustered at either end of the liquor/pop aisle the greasy gears start turning in Muh Muh’s beetus-infused


&gt;At long last she comes to the inescapable truth that she just demolished hundreds of dollars’ worth of wine and--*gasp*--she might have to pay for them!


&gt;Without an accusatory word being said


&gt;”UH DIN’ DO NUTHIN’ THESE BOTTLES WERE BROKUN WHEN AH GOT HURR AND IMMA SUE YERR ASSUS CUZ DIS IS GODDAMN BULLSHIT *blah bluh* CONDISHUN BEETUS *blugh blargh* AN MUH HUSBIND IS GUNNO WHOOP YERR SKINNY BLONDE ASS!”


&gt;I feel a giggle escape my lips


&gt;”So… you’re saying you had nothing to do with this mess?” Bitchy Blonde asks with raised eyebrows


&gt;”NO I DID NAWT MUH SCOOTER SLIPPED ON THIS SHIT AN I HIT MUH KNEE AND NOW UH THINK IT’S BROKE AND IMMA SUE YERR ASS”


&gt;”I SWURR TO FUCKIN’ GAWD I DON’ EVEN DRINK”

At this point, screaming at the top of her lungs while helpless to even get up. Muh Muh is veritably *covered* in wine, it has literally soaked and splattered her entire outfit, staining an even darker purple. There are droplets on her face even, her disgusting feet and ankles are soaked. A massive pool of red wine is steadily spreading through the aisle, creeping under the shelves even and covering a huge amount of floor and Muh Muh sits in the center of the pool. The blinding irony was she would not have been made to pay for it, as per the policy of the store. If she would have stopped bellowing like a wounded wildebeest
 
But it didn't matter because

&gt;Muh Muh is once again wheezing in between riffs of profanity when she begins to execute a 23 point turn to work her way out of gap in the aisle


&gt;Crunching can be heard from big amigo running over bits of wood and glass on the floor


&gt;Muh Muh bumps into the aisles on either side each and every time she changes direction


&gt;With each small collision she pitches like a massive


&gt;This goes on for several minutes


&gt;I’m curled on the floor at this point


&gt;Just as Muh Muh had finally straightened out and was successfully exiting the aisle


&gt;From far away


&gt;But that was where the hilarity ended


&gt;Nothing, quiet belch/hiccup


&gt;And then another and another


&gt;Her right hand went to her heart


&gt;Then the burps began to sound… different somehow


&gt;In fact they sounded… wetter


&gt;She looked up


&gt;As I started into the eyes of the beast a titanic convulsion wracked Muh Muh’s massive frame and the beginning of the end of Muh Muh’s medicun run was coming to a close

Hopefully Part III won’t take so long

So, but has a bag with her. I ask whats in the bag and she says some clothes because she wanted to spend the night. I try to stay calm and say ""Cool"" After a day of watching a movie, introducing her to /r/fatpeoplestories, which induced many laughs and much talking. It starts to get late and she wants to take a shower. She does and I go to the living room to watch some tv. I can only speculate as to what happened now as I think she can't teleport. The Manatee snuck through the backyard in through an open porch door and into my room. Now I hear something strange, it sounded like it was fabric ripping and some fat giggles. I go to investigate, only to find the Manatee in my room, Mirandas bag open and ton of clothes on the floor

She was trying on something Miranda had brought and it was probably 40 sizes too small for the Manatee, Miranda was there and almost in tears. I snap out of it when the Manatee says ""Teehee, why did you invite me over to try this on when this slut is here?teeheeeee"" I say ""I didn't invite you over you fucking cunt! Miranda call the police"" Miranda goes to the house phone to call the police, and the Manatee says ""Don't you fucking dare you whore!"" and starts to walk out of the room, I am standing in the door way and realize she would have to go through me. When she gets close I push her and she falls down. She starts flailing around and after a minute she just gives up and lays there. The only thing I could think at the time was, ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" So the police arrives, Miranda is up front explaining what had happened and after the two officers have to work together to get her up and then arrest her. While on the way out she's yelling ""WHY ARE YOU ARRESTING ME

And today I got a letter saying I've been granted a restraining order, Jessica and others to be summoned as witnesses later.

1375887552.0,1jvx65,The Dark Future of Hamerica,Biriuk,780,200,75,"The year was 2056. America lay in shambles

The swarm. That's what we called them. The roving bands of beasts that slowly prowled the streets in search of food. The resources of our once-great nation had been steadily declining for years but once the swarm began their rounds

I crept carefully through an alleyway beside my old place of employment. Looking around for signs of the swarm

I hadn't been inside since the incident. The building was in shambles, and once that happened you needed to be prepared to move quick. Alone, a member of the swarm was easily dealt with. In large numbers however, it was a different story.

I made my way back to the walk-in freezer. The padlock was still intact

The freezer, but I was desperate. Out of food and in need of nourishment to make the journey out of the city, I needed calories and I needed them fast. Who knows how long it would be before the swarm ran out of food and turned to hunting the ""privileged?"" I couldn't take that risk.

The privileged. That's what they called us, but if anyone could have predicted how it would end, we would have been more prepared.

I was in luck. The freezer was nearly fully stocked. I slung the backpack off of my shoulder and brushed my red hair out of my eyes. Time to get to work.

I grabbed as many of the frozen meat patties as I could carry. The idea of eating them raw made me retch a bit, so I filled the backpack as best I could. Hidden in the back corner, behind a sack of frozen French fries, I found an unexpected treasure: a pint of Haagen-Daazs chocolate ice cream, perhaps left behind by my old manager, Darlene. Ice cream had been a rare treat at best even before the incident, but a pint of it now was worth its weight in gold.

I knew the ice cream wouldn't last long in the summer heat, I turned and snapped the padlock shut behind me. I carefully dodged the wrappers covering the floor and opened the door into the alleyway.

It was bright outside and it took my eyes a few seconds to adjust. I blinked a few times and began to move south towards the main highway leading out of town. I had heard tales of a colony out there, but at the very least I knew the swarm couldn't follow me there and that was enough. That was their weakness: they had to stick to the roads and other handicap-accessible areas, lest they become stuck.

I moved at a slow jog in order to make better time

I tried to speed up, and they now topped out fully loaded at 35 miles per hour. It was a shame, with the energy required to propel that weight at those speeds, we could have conquered the stars. But now the planets would conquer us.

Back in 2028, he became fascinated with Type-II diabetes after his wife, a leader of the fat acceptance movement, was diagnosed.

Xiao worked hard night after night, he found... something. An injection that would alleviate the symptoms of Type-II diabetes and, while unable to cure obesity, could abate the symptoms.

Xiao, he gave it to his wife. The vaccine worked. Too well, in fact. By improving the insulin response and the body's glucose tolerance, Xiao had effectively cured diabetes. What he had also done was increase the grehlin levels of his patients while reducing leptin. The vaccine's net result was someone who was always hungry, but suffered fewer health drawbacks from extreme obesity. The swarm was one step closer to truly being Healthy At Every Size.

As the swarm began to surround me with their carts, wearing my tattered old work uniform, surrounded by the swarm. Was this the end for me? Please God, not like this. 

""Well lookee what we got here

""Th- this is oppression

""YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT OPPRESSION?!"" the leader screeched. She launched into a tirade about thin privilege and curves while my mind desperately groped for a solution. I scanned the surroundings. The highway was 3 miles ahead

""Hey

My mind was in overdrive now. I had to think of something or I would be eaten or worse, I thought about bargaining. But the moment I gave them what they wanted, they would turn on me. THINK!

""No he really does look like I know him..."" another member of the swarm began. Oh shit. If they figure out who I am I'm getting injected for sure. My mind begins to take stock of what I'm carrying and a smile creeps across my face. I know what I must do.

Quickly

""I know who he is! He's RON-""

I interrupted the fatty by speedballing the pint of now-melted ice cream at her.

""LOOK GIRLS! ICE CREAM!"" I shouted. For a moment they sat, slowly, the words I had said began to sink in. The member I had coated with the melted remains of the Haagen-Daasz lifted a chocolate covered chin roll up and gently tongued it.

""He's not lying! It's really is ice cream!"" she said. With those words, fat little fingers tearing at her flesh. Her screams rang heavy in my ears as I sprinted away with my bag full of meat. A few twists and turns later and I found myself holing up inside a second floor apartment long-deserted. 

I hadn't had a shower in weeks

I walked into the bathroom and studied myself in the mirror while running a shower. I was a mess. I slowly peeled off my old work uniform

Many of you hated the last story

Onward. We now know Saggy is a terrible babysitter and her baby momma friend is probably even worse. Saggy also got a cat. BEGIN.

&gt; Sometime later, and passive-aggressiving, Saggy still has not gotten the kitty what it needs, and it's just pooping and peeing up a storm.

&gt; Dramagirl finally gets a litter box and teaches kitty (whom we figured out was a girl) how to poop like a proper lady cat.

&gt; Saggy tries to take credit because there's OBVIOUSLY a lack of feces on the floor now

&gt; Saggy tells us that quiet baby is coming over to stay for a while and do we mind?

&gt; Holy crap of course we don't

&gt; We both agree a baby wouldn't be a problem and wow

&gt; Saggy says ""yea, but she's tired of it and baby's daddy has to get money to come get baby.

&gt; Dramagirl and I share a look I have no gif for because I'm on a phone.

&gt; How much worse is this daddy going to be? 

**A few days and a few baby giggles^yayprogress! later**

&gt; ""Baby daddy is coming today!"" Saggy says through tears.

&gt; Says she ""wants a black baby so bad"" through sobs and shoveling ice cream down her throat.

&gt; Priorities bitch

&gt; Lol that's a lie. She feeds herself better than three college guys feed themselves.

&gt; ""I'm gonna eat nothing but ice cream for the next week to deal with this

&gt; ""Did you know there are hormones in ice cream that make women feel better if they're sad?"" Saggy says through spoon fulls. ""That's why women always eat it on television when they're sad! It makes total sense!""

&gt; bitchwhat.gif

&gt; Daddy gets there. 

&gt; Dramagirl and I get the surprise of our lifetimes.

&gt; Baby daddy is EXCITED to have the baby! Loves the little tyke

&gt; Saggy is instantly in love.

&gt; Baby daddy says baby momma moves to college towns

&gt; The laws suck in the southern USA

&gt; She's already had another baby taken away while she's been here (before Saggy met her) that she had with another college guy before baby daddy.

&gt; Doesn't know why she was arrested

&gt; He hates her with the burning hot passion of a thousand suns.

&gt; Will spend his lifeblood keeping baby away from baby momma.

&gt; Saggy is practically having a conniption because there are to many witnesses around for her to absorb baby daddy into her love-struck ~~heart~~ tummy.

&gt; Immediately tells baby daddy she didn't trust baby momma and tried to get baby away from her as much as possible. Apparently she also felt like a mother to baby after just a few days of babysitting and would he like some pie?

&gt; Look at the pie Saggy made that she's been eating for the past hour bit by bit. It's already over half-gone. 

&gt; She must be on a diet - she's exercising restraint today.

&gt; Saw how much sugar and country crock butter she put in that pie.

&gt; Baby daddy's life is forfeit if he accepts. No mortal could consume that much sugar in one sitting.

&gt; [hfw](http://i.qkme.me/3v7oc7.jpg) and escapes with his life (Thanks /u/pizzatacos!!!).

&gt; Saggy asks if baby would like another piece?

&gt; Another?

&gt; Pretty sure babies shouldn't be eating that much sugar. Baby daddy agrees and says so.

&gt; Saggy knows for a fact that sugar and butter are the healthiest things a growing baby boy can eat and insists the pie was a wonderful idea and she made it all for baby.

&gt; Yea

&gt; ""My mother raised me on sugar and butter and I'm probably the healthiest person in this room

&gt; Look at baby daddy.

&gt; He's about 6 feet and not even a little chubby.

&gt; Look at myself.

&gt; 5'8""

&gt; Look at Saggy.

&gt; Pretty sure she's eaten so much country crock her flesh is mimicking its creamy

&gt; Baby daddy nopes the fuck out of there with baby in tow

&gt; [An approximate representation](http://i.imgur.com/bpAPHnw.jpg)

&gt; [and another](http://i.imgur.com/iGrIHwy.jpg) from /u/thatgirlnoonetalksto

&gt; Saggy returns to her ice cream and pie. 

&gt; Consumes all of it that morning while I did a project in the living room.

&gt; Notices I haven't eaten my slice she gave me a while ago.

&gt; Saggy is in no mood for my anorexic shenanigans.

&gt; Demands I eat my pie and stop being ungrateful.

&gt; ""I'm on a diet Saggy

&gt; Bitch I'm working with exacto knives today

&gt; Saggy dares.

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks can't you see I'm an emotional wreck right now? Can't you be at least a little considerate of my loss? You're hurting my feelings right now because I know you're starving but you still won't eat the pie I made you!"" she says in near hysterics

&gt; I'm tired of Saggy's drama

&gt; ""You had baby for a few days, I'm not starving I had breakfast, and you didn't make it for me OR baby like you told baby daddy you made it for yourself because you apparently need to eat an entire pie for breakfast and a tub of ice cream to cope with your non-existent problems.

&gt; My only regret is that Dramagirl was not there to witness her good teaching at work.

&gt; Saggy starts screaming profanities so thick it made me gain five pounds.

&gt; ""YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE TWAT I'LL CUT YOU FOR BEING SO DISRESPECTFUL TO ME! HOW DARE YOU TREAT MY DEPRESSION SO HARSHLY I'M SUFFERING FROM POST-PARTUM AND I NEED THE ICE CREAM TO BALANCE MY HORMONES! NOT THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND YOU PRIVILEGED LITTLE TRUST FUND BABY

&gt; ""I'd say at least one pie and a tub of ice cream.""

&gt; There was a nuclear explosion guys.

I had to pack up my stuff and finish my project in my room cause she started grabbing my stuff and throwing it. I couldn't stop laughing and I'm bad at hiding it

When Dramagirl got home

The cycle started all over again

I was eating it up like Saggy eats sweets.

I didn't finish my project that day.

So I'm currently driving back to Colorado after a short visit to Texas. It's a long haul without much in the way of pit stops once you get past Amarillo, I notice that the air *reaks* of shit/period and shitty gas station fried food. This should have been an omen, as Love's are notorious for not sucking. There are only 2 stalls. One had an out of order sign, but the handicapped stall door was open a crack, so I assumed it was unoccupied. I'm sure you can see where this is going. As I opened the door wider, I was hit with a wave of shit/period stench.

As it turns out, too tight camo tshirt barely containing dem curves, ratty hair, infected looking piercings, shitty tattoos, disgusting toenails crammed in old, dirty flip flops

I stood there dumbfounded for what seemed an eternity, and screamed ""WHAT DA FUCK, YOU PERV?!"". I beat a hasty retreat, and was trying to to apologize for walking in on her, but she started yelling again, something along the lines of "" GET DA FUCK OUTA HUR SKINNY BITCH.

1371479333.0,1gim3i,Flight attendant vs. fatties,JesusSwallows,667,84,93,"Here are a collection of fat people anecdotes from my mom. She's been a flight attendant for 35 years now

* For a while (like 2002-2008)

* Up until the 90's, those airlines' flights require twice as many.

* At least a week somebody will try to pull the ADA card to the gate agent and demand a first class seat on account of their obesity. It never works

* My mom's good friend almost got fired for giving a (thin) diabetic kid a free airline meal because the Buick-sized asschunk sitting next to her complained to the airline. A 13 year old girl flying alone hadn't realized that the meals weren't free (this was around 2005, almost fired her, but they let her go with a warning when they realized how unlikely fatass's story was (the flight attendant was known among frequent fliers for her excellent service).

* **Also:** Obese people (qualified as anyone who needs a seat belt extension) aren't allowed to sit in the exit row

My mom once almost had to report a terror threat because of someone's obesity. I'm not kidding. This was in early 2002

An old fat turd of a woman (OFT) had been rude and needy the entire flight, *no exceptions*. You sit there and shit your pants if need be; you do not get out of your seat. Also, the first class lavatory is *only* for first-class passengers; nobody from coach is allowed past the divider between the two cabins.

But clearly these rules don't apply to OFT, gripping the first class divider like her life depended on it) and gets up off the jump seat to let her know that she's breaking federal law and needs to plant her ass back in her seat.

When my mom starts to tell her she has to get back in her seat immediately, and waddle-runs-oozes up the first class aisle as fast as she can until THWOMP she falls on her face in front of the cockpit door and commences screaming that she can't get up. It's clear she's not injured, however, and has sat up.

My mom and the rest of the crew couldn't care less about the woman's well being. They have a passenger who has gotten up during descent, this is a potential terrorist situation and she could lose her job if she doesn't treat it as such. Another flight attendant goes to the rear galley and radios the captain to let him know what's going on right outside the cockpit door.

Tired of her shit and not exactly following protocol, and is now magically able to get herself up. She struggles to her seat, fuming. The pilot don't have her arrested, even though he absolutely could have.

Best part: she had to wait for a wheelchair to deplane

**TL:DR:** Entitled chunkums almost gets arrested for attempted terrorism.

**Edit:** Fun fact: flight attendants are not afraid to straight crop-dust you in the face. Don't be a dick if you're sitting in the aisle.

**Edit 2:** Sorry I didn't greentext; I'm new. I read the sidebar and will *not* say ""let me know if you want to hear more"" but I'll be home this weekend so I'll get a fresh retelling of her other stories. Also,,False,self,t5_2vzax,1371513676.0,,True

TL;DR Muh Muh’s medicun run has finally come to an end.

Not sure how many laughs you’ll get outta this one, and all of their absurdity and laziness kind of coalesces into something… greater.

First off

When we last left Muh Muh in part 2, in fact, thin privilege.

This all takes place at one of the larger chain ‘Marts in a mystical area situated in Midwest Michigan, is a veritable hammy cesspool of beetusy proportions. Since Muh Muh needs no introduction at this point, let’s ~~jump~~ bite right into it shall we?


&gt;Be me
encountered in my life


&gt;Massive be her girth


&gt;The massive cart which had recently tried to slay Muh Muh, cottage cheesey ass cheeks and colossal thunder thighs


&gt;Hark, his lifeless frame on the way to being a titanium-reinforced pancake by Muh Muh’s incomprehensible 700ish lbs


&gt;But I paid less attention to big amigo’s corpse just then than fatties to a Chinese restaurant without a buffet


&gt;For at that moment


&gt;I acknowledge to myself that this is likely the end for Muh Muh


&gt;Muh Muh flopped lifelessly forward
fading to obscurity


&gt;Karma must surely be real; the universe had meted out to Muh Muh what she had deserved


&gt;Ah


&gt;Vengeance for her poor daughter


&gt;Vengeance for the poorer big amigo, soaked with Sutter Home, and ultimately flattened in a most undignified death


&gt;Vengeance to all the people over the years that she had so mercilessly berated and treated so shittily


&gt;The ambulance pulled up


&gt;With some effort


&gt;You see my thighroid-challenged Redditors


&gt;Firstly


&gt;And secondly


&gt;Because


&gt;Do you think I’m George R. R. Fucking Martin? Do you think I’d bother to tell a story where the main character died right in the middle!?


&gt;No, for you’ll find none in this FPS


&gt;Muh Muh’s heart may have endured years of abuse


&gt;Muh Muh’s arteries were more clogged than the toilets at The Old Country buffet


&gt;But Muh Muh remained alive; indeed, a 
sign of something even more horrifying than death


&gt;With a sickening sound, there’s no way to put it nicely: Muh Muh blew chunks. And then she blew some more chunks

&gt;For an uncannily accurate illustration, skip to 0:20)


&gt;Well


&gt;In fact the substance that was currently being expelled from Muh Muh’s grease hole was an almost-black shade of red


&gt;For a moment it seemed the bouts would never end


&gt;The sheer volume being ejected from her distended stomach was staggering


&gt;Muh Muh unceremoniously coughed and spit some loose phlegm onto the floor


&gt;Muh Muh jerked her head up


&gt;And just like that Muh Muh was shouting again


&gt;“BITCH DON’ YOU CALL NO FUCKIN’ ABURLANCE I AIN’ GOT HEALTH INSURINS! IMMA SUE YERR AYUSS IF YOU CALL—“


&gt;Her screaming was cut short by another convulsion and another wave, was mixing with the *still* expanding pool of red wine to create a goop that was currently opening a portal to the 13th dimension of hell right on the floor


&gt;As the this scene continued

Now, cadavers didn’t touch my gag reflex. But the one thing that makes me throw up instantly is the sight, smell, or even the sound of someone else vomiting.

Oh


&gt;I panic and run to the cooler with fresh veggies in it to breath in the cool air, dirt-crusted Barbie doll


&gt;[MFW]( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/126/314/3cd8a33a.png?1306264975)


&gt;Muh Muh must’ve had another break in her vomiting because I can once again hear her bleats coming from the aisle next to me


&gt;As the vomiting seems to have stopped


This night shift manager, no pun intended, lineup). He was a lazy piece of shit who had the most rancid body odor ever, with a face similar to [The Penguin as played by Danny DeVito]( http://images.ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danny-devito_penguin_batman.jpg) but standing at 6'4 380 lbs. He was a most pathetic creature, who shame-ate constantly and had a fuse shorter than his dick, with the worst case of PowerTrip-itis I have ever seen. His default mode, however, over sincere


&gt;The store is in chaos at this point


&gt;Her screams are no longer intelligible; her lazy eyes are wandering and twitching aimlessly


&gt;[HFW]( http://derek.broox.com/photo/don-vitos-back-to-school-tour/full/2836/don-vito.jpg)


&gt;I’m struck with a sudden idea. I crouch next to Daughtermoon


&gt;”Hey
else in your family?”


&gt;Daughtermoon brightens instantly


&gt;She begins to express concern for her muh muh


&gt;Her heartbreaking sincerity and the brief glimpse of her life almost make me tear up


&gt;Flabby Patty is still seated of course (never know when a rogue disabled customer might come walking down aisle 1 needing that cart that he so thoughtfully and selflessly moved all the way up to the front of the store)


&gt;Bitchy Blonde agrees


&gt;Muh Muh doesn’t seem to be in any immediate danger or harm


&gt;Alright, they disperse


&gt;Muh Muh is mumbling and making gurgling noises from the other side of aisle


&gt;The smell collapses my nasal openings; I say a silent prayer of thanks for this small blessing


&gt;BB orders me to “call the fuckin’ Mexicans” (her exact words) to clean up the mess


&gt;I page Mexibro and Mexiplanet: “Clean up in aisle 1


&gt;I can’t help but suppress another giggle


&gt;I remember who I’m trying to get ahold of and repeat the phrase in terrible Spanish


&gt;Hopefully none of the few night shoppers knew Spanish


JW if you all have picked up on the fact that we were an extremely professional lot of workers who gave many fucks about life in general


&gt;BB’s face is pale white


&gt;”O-OK


&gt;”Don’t worry


&gt;Expecting relief from Daughtermoon, and bolts away to hide, screaming about how “her daddy is gonna be so mad!”


&gt;BB presses her fingers to her temples


&gt;Just then I turn to see Mexibro and Mexiplanet reach the end of aisle one


&gt;”At least you aren’t them!” I tell BB in an obnoxiously cheery voice 
(yes, racist, man-hating human being)


&gt;BB gives me the most intense “fuck off” look I have ever seen


&gt;That is


&gt;Yes


Guess there’s going to be a part 4 before the epilogue, I have a kundishun! I originally wanted to end the story in part III, but guess you all are getting a bonus installment.

That is

There was this little child

My heart sunk as I could only see in front of me how she would face so many problems in the future, now she is facing a hard life with constant struggle because her parents didnt take care of her.

That time has come. I must once more face the beast.

By the time this story happened

&gt;Going to work

&gt;Same shift as Turboham again

&gt;I need a new job

&gt;Get to work

&gt;Turboham isn't there yet

&gt;notsurewhatiexpected.jpg

&gt;Start work

&gt;Annie tells me that DM is coming in today

&gt;Do DM things

&gt;Check up on the store

&gt;Make sure we are all working

&gt;Good times will be had by all

&gt;Almost 45 minutes after I started

&gt;Hear all cows begin to wail in unison or their fallen brethren

&gt;All pigs in North America keel over in a show of solidarity

&gt;A cataclysmic event has just struck the meat trade

&gt;The Event will henceforth be known as ""Turboham's Afternoon Snack.""

&gt;She waddles in

&gt;She extracts not one

&gt;These sandwiches are so unhealthy

&gt;Literally just beef, and mayo

&gt;Over 1000 Calories a pop

&gt;x3

&gt;Turboham unhinges her jaw

&gt;mfw she doesn't even chew

&gt;I can't bear witness to the feeding

&gt;I go to reorganize shelf

&gt;A few minutes later

Now

&gt;DM walks in

&gt;Annie is in the back

&gt;I give him a curt nod

&gt;I'm surrounded by game cases with an empty shelf in front of me

&gt;I'm not really in a position to help

&gt;heunderstands.goodguydm

&gt;This leaves Turboham

&gt;Turboham doesn't know who Ryan in

&gt;She momentarily stops feeding to gawk at the new arrival

&gt;Hunger and primal attraction juxtaposed and both engaged

&gt;See the internal conflict

&gt;Compromise

&gt;She rushes out to offer help to Ryan

&gt;By rushes

&gt;Stands in front of DM

&gt; ^^teehee

&gt;Twirling her greasy hair

&gt;Playfully toeing the ground

&gt;That part of the floor is now permanently warped

&gt;Trying to take seductive

&gt;Pinky raised and all

&gt;mfw

&gt;Ryan looks stunned

&gt;He has only heard tales of the Turboham

&gt;He thought they were being exaggerated

&gt;Nope

&gt;He decides to roll with it

&gt;R: ""Yeah

&gt;TH: ""I know the new Call of Duty game has RPGs in it""

&gt;I don't know what's in a worse state; my jimmies or my sides

&gt;Ryan stares blankly

&gt;Turboham continues

&gt;TH: ""You could always come over to my place and I could show you how to

&gt;Ryan has gone pale

&gt;Turboham strokes his upper arm confectionately

&gt;He's beyond pale

&gt;He's looking a little green around the gills

&gt;Poor guy

&gt;I could intervene

&gt;R: ""Do you treat all your customers like this?""

&gt;TH: ""Only the yummy ones.""

&gt;Ryan visibly chokes back fear vomit

&gt;He's afraid he will be eaten

&gt;We've all been there

&gt;You're now one of us

&gt;One of us

&gt;One of us

&gt;R: ""Is Annie in?""

&gt;TH: ""Why do you need to see *her*?""

&gt;Her voice dripping with malice

&gt;Or mayo

&gt;I chime in ""Yeah Ryan

&gt;Ryan walks past Turboham

&gt;Takes one last

&gt;Closes the door

&gt;Turboham looks confused

&gt;She asks who the hell that hunk of man meat was*

&gt;*Her words

&gt;That was the DM

&gt;She is now a little pale as well

&gt;Mutters something about being stressed

&gt;Needs stress-relieving calories

&gt;Walks out door

&gt;A few minutes later

&gt;A: ""Where's Turboham""

&gt;Me: ""I think she went for food again.""

&gt;Annie facepalms so hard it causes an earthquake in Japan

&gt;Ryan simply looks bemused

&gt;R: ""I'll wait

&gt;Annie and I lock eyes

&gt;ofw

&gt;We hang out with Ryan for almost half an hour before Turboham returns clutching a McBeetus bag

&gt;As soon as she walks in

&gt;R: ""Can I see you in the back

&gt;TH takes a long slurp of her milkshake and nods

&gt;They go to the back

&gt;All is quiet

&gt;10 minutes later

&gt;Turboham runs out crying

&gt;No beetus bag in sight

&gt;Right out the front door

&gt;Ryan emerges from the back

&gt;He looks like he just fought a war

&gt;Hollow

&gt;Poor man

&gt;He briefs us on what happened

&gt;As he went over the long list of grievances against Turboham

&gt;While she was eating

&gt;He basically told her that we weren't going to continue employing her because of her appalling conduct

&gt;She threw the last half of her burger at him

&gt;Then picked it back up and **ATE IT**

&gt;Then she asked if she could have another chance

&gt;He told her no. Get your things and leave

&gt;That's when she wailed and ran out crying

That was the last I saw of Turboham at that job

Bit of info: My cousin, there is absolutely no hope for her. Her mother (my aunt), Ani, has always been a very large lady herself, but she is very nice and never blames her weight on anything but her own bad habits. My grandma, who has a small appearance in this story, has always been very petite. Her size has nothing to do with this story, Ani is my dad's sister-in-law

Be me, about 160lbs of athletic build, just came home from buying new clothes for school. It's almost the start of my senior year of high school so I've been shopping with my grandma all day for clothes and supplies. Don't be Des, ~21-22, 5'4ish, about 260lbs at the time because ""summertime is for eating whatever you want teehee"" who was already there when I got home. Des springs up and demands to see what I bought. I show her, and she immediately demands I let her try on one of the pairs of jeans.

I tell her no, and second of all, they wouldn't fit her. She starts whaling about how I'm being mean, but her mom shuts her up and tells her to sit down. I go put my bags in my closet then come back out to make coffee for everyone. After a few minutes, Des excuses herself to the restroom. A few minutes after that, we hear a sound that is quite undescribable. Ani and I rush down the hallway to find Des in *my bedroom* instead of the bathroom, and you already know where this is going.

So remember that fridge cage I said I was gonna buy earlier? I eventually got a nice

I put my milk, meats, etc. in there. Veggies were safe outside the cage. It was a little annoying because there wasn't TONS of room in there, and I had to bike to the grocery store a lot.

It was necessary FPS

Anyways, it had a 5 number code on it that we obviously weren't gonna tell Saggy, and we got to giggle at her getting furious when she found out it was there.

&gt; ""Yea we wish you weren't a food clepto either Saggy

Ohhh boy did Saggy hate that cage. It not only prevented her from gorging herself on our food after she'd eaten her month's worth in a week

She tried desperately to look over our shoulders while we opened the lock

**THE BEAST WAS DEFEATED**

**AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING**

Until one day...

&gt; Just got back from lovely weekend back in my hometown.

&gt; It's early in the morning

&gt; Gonna make myself some cereal before I head to class.

&gt; Open fridge.

&gt; Cage is there

&gt; It is also completely empty.

&gt; I don't make a sound

&gt; Open the freezer.

&gt; Full to the brim with Saggy's freezer junk. 

&gt; Quickly but quietly start to place everything in a new trash bag.

&gt; I empty that entire freezer.

&gt; Go to the cabinet.

&gt; There's not much, and a jar of peanut butter.

&gt; Stick the peanut butter in my bag cause I'm still hungry.

&gt; Put everything else in the garbage bag.

&gt; Grab bookbag and garbage bag and go to class

**LATER THAT AFTERNOON**

&gt; Quietly trying to enter the apartment undetected.

&gt; Nope, because random thrown things are scattered on the floor.

&gt; ""SAGGY-SUCKS DID YOU TAKE MY FOOD I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DRAMAGIRL JUST GOT HOME FROM HER TRIP THIRTY MINUTES AGO SO IT WASN'T FUCKING HER IT HAD TO BE YOU I'M GONNA GET YOU KICKED OUT OF THIS APARTMENT DON'T YOU FUCKING FALL ASLEEP TONIGHT OR YOU'LL BE DEAD!""

&gt; I feign confusion like a sweet innocent girl and ask what she's talking about.

&gt; She swings open the freezer door and the glorious cavern is revealed.

&gt; Seeing that frosty void next to Saggy's puffy

&gt; I gasp in surprise!

&gt; Run to the fridge and swing the door open.

&gt; There the cage sits

&gt; I gasp again.

&gt; ""Holy crap some fat lunatic stole my food too! What the heck is going on???""

&gt; Saggy wasn't expecting this turn of events. Her chins quiver as her brain tries to find a way to keep yelling at me about the food I obviously dumped without outing herself.

1364491512.0,1b6s0f,My sister...unfortunately ,MooseRidingRoosevelt,663,87,137,"This is short and sweet and will be more of a frustrated rant than anything. (Also typed on iPhone so forgive spelling and formatting errors please)

Tl;dr: my sister fakes getting sick or injured to get attention and justification for her ham planet status and screws me over in the process.

My sister is well on her way to ham planet status. She is 5 foot 6 and almost 270 pounds. She drinks smokes and complains endlessly about the various made up diseases and conditions that plague her on a daily basis.

 She has been like this since age 12 when she started faking sick to get out of school. At age 16 she dropped out to be homeschooled and then never finished that. She complains about her bad knees and her stomach that needs such attention that she can't do anything hard or strenuous. But when it came time for something fun all of the sudden she got 100% better! Able to leap tall buildings and crush innocent bystanders on the other side. Her actions aggravate me to no end. 

Ever since my parents kicked her of the house one year ago

Flash forward to last weekend. I am getting ready for awesome spring break of rock climbing hiking and camping with my friends when I get a call from my parents. They ask me to take my sister to the ER because the ambulance companies in her area won't take her anymore. Apparently too many fake calls about heart attacks to get attention gets you blacklisted by 4 ambulance companies. They tell me that her back hurts and that her stomach hurts and that I need to go pick her up pronto. 

I try and tell them that I am literally 20 minutes from leaving and that she's probably fine but my mom tells me to just go pick her up so she'll stop calling her. Fine. I drive over and I go to the door. My sister is walking around in a robe carrying a bucket of KFC and chatting on the phone with one of her friends. I am appalled. She is now easily 300+ pounds and very obviously not in pain. She ends her call and claps her meatpaws together and says 'ready to go?!' Like we're about to go on a fucking adventure. I just stare at her and then walk out. 

She waddles after me and tells me that she's calling mom to make me take her (good god she's 23 I'm 25 what the hell) and I go to get in my car when my phone rings. It's my mom and if course she tells me to do it or I'm cut off (I'm borrowing money from them as a loan to get through jc so I can use my GiBill to get through upper division once I transfer). Fine. Ill just drop her off then. Nope that's not good enough because I have to stay with her. Why

We drive to the hospital (unfortunately the one I work at) and as we pull up she cues the most pitiful whale call she can and we walk(waddle) in. She can't fit into the wheel chairs else she'd probably require that. She walks up to the counter of the ER and the nurse just stares at her. Everybody knows her here and knows her antics. 5 hours later

The doc is one of my bosses (I'm an ER scribe

She's been here 20 times in the past 2 months and almost every time for something just vague enough to be considered possible in the realms of medicine. He goes through the spiel of you're too fat and too sedentary and that's why she's like this. My sister explodes. Tells this doc he's stupid for not seeing how sick she obviously is (no shit?) and that she's going to sue him for not helping her. 

Cue the montage music as we see my sister being told by many people with various high degrees of medicine and public health that its all in her head. She screams rants raves and tells everybody within shouting distance that she's not fat she's just sick and that she can't lose weight and her medical history proves that. 

They send her home the following morning and on the way home she asks me

Unfortunate mature women complained she had a sore in her left thigh. She was morbidly obese with multiple medical issues. I had a nurse assist me in uncovering her left thigh and rotate it to view the complaint. Just prior to my visualization, arteries with no necrotic tissue. **The reason for no rotten flesh or fat was because there were the biggest maggots marching back and forth.**


Thin privilege is not having maggots eat the dying flesh that your fat cavities have hidden from you.  Or something.

1375818709.0,1jtzro,Traveling Fats: How two women ruined a good time for dozens of strangers.,PhantomoftheMummy,699,124,103,"This happened a few years ago. 

A neighborhood block party is usually a pretty dull affair.  Neighbors you don’t know and some you actively try to avoid get together to try to learn one another’s names.  I had never attended our neighborhood party, so we took advantage of the nice weather and the offer of free barbecue and we walked over to see what it was all about.

There were only about ten or twelve people there at 1:00, platters and cooler.  We were too late, but it was only one!  What could have happened? I noticed that there were three bags of charcoal sitting near the now cool charcoal grills, and that only one had been opened.  It was still half full.  

Then a neighbor I knew- let’s call him Doug- saw me.  He bugged his eyes in the internationally recognized expression to communicate “I KNOW” and gestured to a pair of flesh mountains seated at a picnic table the city had loaned the block party for the day.

Each one of these women took up almost all of the bench they sat on. I’m not kidding when I say that each of these ladies could have weighed as much as five hundred pounds.  Both were slick with perspiration. One had her hair pulled into a greasy side ponytail and the other had her hair shaved on one side of her head and dyed the other side pink. Both wore sleeveless dresses over filth blue jeans.  Neither wore shoes.

In front of them were bones and paper plates stacked and piled, they hadn’t said much to anyone and no one knew who they were.  If I’d seen them before, I would have remembered them. They were very unfriendly toward everyone, cursing another woman out for picking up a stack of their paper plates that had blown off the table and onto the grass.  Her words were nearly unintelligible, as she had a mouth packed full of rib meat at the time, but basically, she told the stranger to, skinny ass bitch!”  It was like a line from a movie.  I started to hate these women.  

Turns out these two had commandeered the food table from the start, several bags of chips, God knows how much Pepsi, and countless baby back ribs and hamburgers. What they didn’t actually finish eating they “claimed” by stacking it on a plate and crushing it down with their filthy, greasy hands. From what I was told, the remaining food was being served directly from the grill to the other people that showed up but one of these women had claimed that they were “first in line” for everything, since they weren’t done yet.  They ignored her that time. Other neighbors would arrive with food and just leave again

The biggest of them (but not by much) belched and softly sang to herself as she ate.  Both laughed quite a bit too.  They mumbled to one another, other than to demand more food.  The neighborhood block captain came by with his family and told a group of us that these women were not residents of this block or any other place he knew of in the larger neighborhood.  
As he was talking to us

I asked them how this could have happened, and such.  The big one rolled her eyes at him, looked at her partner-in-fat and said, “That’s it, let’s go.  

They stood up together, the passenger threw a bunch of trash out into the street in front of the party site.  It was amazing.  They had Colorado plates on their van.  We live in Seattle. 

We came to realize that they were probably just driving by and decided to stop and eat all of our food for free

TLDR: Super obese monsters ate all of the food set out for a neighborhood barbecue.

&gt; A wild lone

&gt; RW turns on her ""charm"" (I use that word lightly

&gt; Her hair is too short and scraggly to be twirled round her fins

&gt; Leans over the counter seductively instead

&gt; RW ""See anything you like

&gt; Instead of smacking RW across the face

&gt; FC ""My husband *told you* that I have allergies and you still sold him a ring that I cannot wear! I should sue your ass into the ground!""

&gt; RW ""He never told me you were allergic to anything. Maybe it slipped his mind with a natural looking woman in front of him.""

To recap

&gt; FC ""As if he would ever be tempted like a lump like you when he has me to come home to. More like you got so distracted by a dick in front of your counter that you were more interested in flirting with him than selling him a proper product!""

&gt; RW ""Maybe if you ate properly

Four of us initially agree to rent the apartment: me ""Lulu

With less than twenty days left to find two other people,"" a third year like us who Yuri recognized from one of his classes. We looked him up on Facebook and decided that he seemed rather normal. The other was ""Ginger,"" who neither of us knew. Her Facebook was more vague- there were no pictures of her, the only friends she had had names like ""DarkAngel4353,"" and most of her status updates were about FarmVille or the Sims. Not really assuring. We were desperate though, and put up a time and destination for all of us to meet.

Yuri and I get to the coffee place ten minutes before we're supposed to be there. We're delighted to find Eric already waiting for us, around 140. Eric is a 6'0 and athletic slightly scruffy Swede. We take a liking to him right away. Eric is nice, funny, and has two jobs so he's sure to be able to pay rent every month. Eric is good people. About 30-40 minutes pass while we drink coffee, get to know each other, and wait for our final roommate. We get rather restless waiting, but hey nobody's perfect. Maybe she's just running late.

Finally, it's just two middle aged, fat women. They probably just want to grab the table next to us- no, they're stopping in front of us. One of them is about 5'9, looked to be in her thirties, plump but attractive for an older woman. She points to me. ""Are you Lulu?"" I confirm. She smiles, and says, I'm Ginger's mother."" The milky-white, fatter

None of us wanting to seem rude, was 4'11 and nearing 350 pounds. We were all wearing light clothing as it was summer in the Midwest, but the sundress Ginger wore was to say the least, not very flattering. Ginger's mother explains she just came to make sure we weren't all serial killers, and politely excused herself. Before she leaves though, Ginger stopped her, and asked her for $20. Since they'd entered the cafe, but just hands over the bill.

As soon as her mother leaves, two brownies, two cake pops, and a banana muffin. Yuri, Eric, and I were eyeing each other throughout all of this, wondering what we had all just gotten ourselves into.

Ginger returned to our table with her tray. It took some time before we were able to coax some info from her. Ginger claimed she was ""starving, an art major, and her parents would be paying for her. We start going over the apartment, the lease, and some general rules. It was the usual stuff: you have to come up with your share of the rent on time, you cleaned up after yourself, no loud music late at night, etc. Yuri and I were to share the master bedroom and bathroom

""Isn't this going to be awesome?"" Ginger says to Eric, no. Yuri and I explain that were are simply best friends. Sharing a room would save both of us money. Furthermore, Yuri is very much gay. Ginger looks taken aback, and says she's never met a gay person before. Not surprising, since were in the middle of the Bible Belt. She says something like, ""I go to church a lot. I don't think my Daddy would be okay with me living with gay people. I went to Baptist school."" I wanted to tell her to fuck off by then. No one was forcing her to move in with us. Eric didn't have a problem with Yuri being gay. But Ginger stayed, we set up a meeting with the landlord to sign the lease, and that was it.

Yuri, meet up for dinner/drinks, go to see Eric's friend's band play, and by moving day we'd gotten pretty close. Eric even introduces Yuri to Yuri's soon-to-be boyfriend. We know we're assholes for excluding Ginger, but she'd put off Yuri by her religiousness, Eric by her flirtatiousness, and me by... well, she couldn't get into the places we went to.

About three weeks had passed since we saw Ginger by moving day. Eric had gotten to the apartment very early morning, father, and brothers carried everything to her room. Like Ginger's mother, they were very nice and polite, not at all huge gaping wastes of space. Yuri and I were giggling about how it looked as if everything Ginger owned was bought from Hot Topic. Goth Hello Kitty, Edward from Twilight bedspreads, and a cut-out of Taylor Lautner. I'm not even kidding. Shortly after, and politely said goodbye to Ginger. Ginger did not look pleased.

Ginger snacked on baked Lays chips as her family brought in her stuff. She said she was trying to get healthier. That explains why she ate only two family size bags of the stuff. I'd also been on kind of a health kick that summer and cut out rice and bread, and I wanted to shed those pounds. Ginger rolled her eyes. “You know Lulu, don't have to lose weight to get noticed by a guy,” she said to me. “Guys like curvy girls. You're a girl, you should embrace what God gave you.” You think God gave you all that? I laughed it off and said I wasn't doing it to attract a man. Ginger looked like she didn't believe me. “Please. As if you're not doing all of this for Eric. That's really misogynistic of you.” I don't think that word means what you think it means, I thought, but I didn't say that to her. Ginger added, I don't think Eric thinks of you like that.” Eric

This was the beginning of our year with Ginger. Yes

Back to the story. The customers of the shop quickly take a liking to me as I am generally friendly and talkative, so I'm happy especially since it helps a lot with affording a laptop. I can see A getting grumpier by the day, she see me as a threat since I'm technically making more money than her, and our boss didn't make us report personal tips. Let me take a second here to mention that the tip jar never ever had more than a couple dollars in it while A worked. People don't tip rudeness. Every time I talk with a customer, A audibly huffs and sulks. By this time, I am more than sick of A's constant complaining, she is always bitching about “hard” her life is, wtf) so she moved out. A's mom isn't a bitch, and she blames it on her mom shrinking her clothes in the wash to try to make her lose weight when in reality she is just getting visibly fatter by the month. Porkplanets gonna pork.

On this particular day, filling the condiment bars, and taking the chairs off the tables, A starts in with me.

A: “I can't believe how shallow people are. They make me so mad

MFW it's 6:15am aka too damn early for this shit so I just keep quiet and continue getting shit done before any customers come in. A of course isn't helping because she's just too damn special.

A: “I SAID--”

“I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID, so either help out or shut up.”

A keeps talking of course. “I personally don't see why people like you so much, curvy girls. They even give you money for being so skinny and unhealthy! It just isn't fair. I shouldn't have to have an eating disorder like you just so people will like me!”

By this time I am done setting up the place for business but I don't unlock the doors yet. There isn't anyone outside and I don't want anyone walking in hearing this shit anyway. I am so sick of fatties telling me I am anorexic or bulimic. I mean seriously, but even if I was, it's not their place to comment on someone else's weight.

Me: “Look, they dislike you because you don't ever talk to them. You just make their drink, hand it to them, and turn away. You could at least smile a bit or even say 'Have a good day!' Even if you don't mean it, pretend like you do, they just want to feel like you appreciate their business. Instead, I can see in their eyes they're thinking 'Wow, I sure as hell know way too much about you and I've only been here a month. Does your mom even know how you talk about her? Do you think she would still pay half your rent, and I'm not even skinny. Fuck logic. You really think you're healthy? Don't even get me started on your so-called 'health'.”

A: “I'm just not a morning person! And--”

Me: “Then why are you working the morning shift? There is a night shift position available

A: “I can't work that late because (insert lame crappy excuse here)

Me: “I mean that you don't eat healthy in any sense of the word. Pastries and milkshakes for breakfast

A: “But I have hypothyroidism! I need to eat throughout the day so my thighroid doesn't flare up and I pass out!”

Oh you dumb bitch

Me: “Look, vegetables, and nuts that don't require any cooking. You could bring those in tupperware containers and keep them under the counter or in the employee mini fridge for when you're hungry. The grocery stores even sell stuff that's pre-cut so you don't even have to spend any time preparing your food. Look, the bottom line here is that people don't care if you're fat, if you were nice they would like you. But you aren't nice and you live in your own little world of entitlement, so of course people aren't going to like you. And don't claim to be healthy around me when all you eat is sugar, cream

At this point A doesn't even know how to respond, one less day of hearing her bitch and coming insanely close to shoving her out of my path because she just stands in the way while glued to her phone. I open up for business (no customers had even walked by yet, which is pretty typical as we usually didn't get our first customer until about 8:30am), work my shift, earn tips like a baus, and when my boss comes to take over so I can go home, I give him a quick explanation of why A isn't there and he just laughs, lets me take all the tips from the tip jar (which was actually a lot that day)

TL;DR Whah! My feels!

Hello my friends! I'm sorry for my absence

My first day back I was greeted with a lovely chorus of ""I missed you!"" ""I'm so glad your back!""

Story as follows!

&gt; Back at work after two gloriously sore and lazy weeks off

&gt; Bit slower than my old peppy self

&gt; Boss catches me up on issues that have been happening since I've been gone

&gt; RW has had THIRTEEN COMPLAINTS from customers within my two week absence

&gt; And nearly DOUBLE that number of complaints from coworkers

&gt; It eventually got too much for my poor boss to handle and she ended up losing her temper

&gt; Boss has been blowing up on RW all day

&gt; Constantly on the phone with personal calls

&gt; Constantly eating

&gt; Ignoring employees that need her help

&gt; Ignoring customers that need her help

&gt; Ignoring all of the other responsibilities we're tasked with as supervisors

&gt; RW slips up *again* right in front of our boss

&gt; ""RW we JUST went over this! I don't understand how you can be so absolutely incompetent or forgetful or whatever excuse you want to give when we literally just had this conversation FIVE MINUTES AGO.""

&gt; RW pouts and pretends that she's going to cry

&gt; Boss ain't fuckin' havin' it. Not today.

&gt; ""Everyone has personal issues they have to deal with RW. You seem to be the only one special enough to think that you can use your medical condition as an excuse to be lazy. JUST DO YOUR DAMN JOB.""

Now the part I find unacceptable is that this was done in front of the entire store

I've got another bit to post

TL;DR - See title.

&gt;Be me. 18 male

&gt;Extremely tired. Barely conscious. Awake for 40+ hours.

&gt;Waiting in line at airport security. Line moving aggravatingly slow.

&gt;Be behind wildobese couple. [Know that this is going to take forever.](http://i.imgur.com/GxFvMNJ.jpg)

(a play on wildebeest

&gt;Both smell awful. Have to put my nose in my shirt and hide my face.

&gt;Wait for couple to bend down and take their shoes off.

&gt;Woman behind me [physically recoils from the smell.](http://i.imgur.com/SEpCU.gif)

&gt;Waiting in line to go into the body scanner.

&gt;Pack of wildobese in front of me. Momma wildobese approaches the scanner.

&gt;TSA says

&gt;Female wildobese checks every pocket she has. Can barely hit her hands into the pockets of her denim booty-shorts.

&gt;Shake my head and look around. Over 100 people are [watching this woman](http://i.imgur.com/8TlB213.gif) waste their time waiting in a security line.

&gt;[People all around us are muttering](http://i.imgur.com/gaTSDI4.gif) but she has no clue. She walks up to the scanner.

&gt;Can't fit.

&gt;[Facepalm.png](http://i.imgur.com/yVVFM.jpg)

&gt;Tries again and again. Literally cannot fit into the TSA scanner.

&gt;TSA woman starts to smirk. Says

&gt;Wildobese starts to scream.

&gt;""I hava right

&gt;""Ma'am

&gt;Wildobese stands still. She glaces around and sees a thousand glaring eyes on her. She looks at the TSA agent and stays put.

&gt;""Ma'am step this way. Now."" 

&gt;There is no quavering in the TSA woman's voice. She is about 6'1""

&gt;[Popcorn.gif](http://zeroshift.imgur.com/popcorn_gifs#17)

&gt; TSA woman grabs wildobese and tries to lead her to the manual search station.

&gt;Suddenly everything explodes.

&gt;Wildobese male screams

&gt;Entire room recoils but wants to know what happens next.

&gt;TSA agent pulls out his radio and screams

(I honestly don't remember what he said. It was something along those lines

&gt;TSA woman pulls out her baton, but commanding and almost calmly.

&gt;2 Additional TSA agents run up and subdue the man while the TSA woman tends to the female.

&gt;More TSA show up. They form a temporary perimeter around the scene and the two wildobeses are lead away.

&gt;After everything was over the security line returned to normal. People in the line clap and I get to go through the security scanner.

TSA woman throws down with a wildobese and I have funny faces so you should just read the post.

I was going to post this later on in the series. Because they come up to the present day (May) but I'll post it now since people are desperate to know how my broken fingers came to be

&gt; Be a sunny but chilly late afternoon. Myself, Two other housemates, Cuteguy, his friend (who is interestred in KK) and Porkplanet at home. 

&gt; Let's go and chill down the beach and get some fresh air. 

&gt; coolok.jpeg

&gt; We all drive down in our cars. Cuteguy and two housemates all contribute £2 each for Diesal for my car since it's a 30min drive there and back. 

&gt; Porkplanet does not contribute. 

&gt; Suggests we stop on the way to get McFatty Ice Cream at McDicks. I say no. 

&gt; alreadynothappywithher.zip 

&gt; Get to beach. Tide is coming in. People are sat on rocks nearby. Ok cool. 

&gt; We find a nice patch of rock to sit on. I nestle down. 

&gt; As I am still nestling down on the rock and place my hand near the crease of the next rock to rest. 

YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

&gt; Porkplanet comes from behind. Balances on a wobbly rock. Somehow dislodges several smaller rocks  behind her. Probably due to her 300lb+ mass. Her weight is literally interfearing the entropy of rocks that have been on this coast for millions of years. Changing the landscape one step at a time. 

&gt; One rock comes hurtling towards me from behind. I can't see it. 

&gt; It has the shape and size of a Rugby ball. 

&gt; The weight of a thousand suns. 

&gt; It crashes and lands directly on top of my pinky and ring finger on my right hand. 

&gt; Feel a crack.

&gt; [MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m58jqbOihk1rxckzmo1_500.gif).

&gt; I let out a scream akin to a dog whistle. 

&gt; Cannot move hand this rock is heavy. 

&gt; Blind panic. Tears within 5 seconds.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""HOLD ON DON'T MOVE YOUR HAND ILL PICK UP THE ROCK""

&gt; Me: ""HURRY I THINK SOMETHING BROKE""

&gt; She bends over. 

&gt; Her mass is not used to this unusual exercise. Weight shifts.

&gt; For milliseconds before she is able to get a full grasp on the rock to pick it up. She is leaning HER WHOLE FUCKING BODY WEIGHT ON IT.

&gt; Feel another crack. 

&gt; She's actually broken my hand.

&gt; Another dog whistle scream. 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnbvm8FoXm1qhafj6.gif) my two fingers are visibly broken.

&gt; [MF](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pjb7hXN91r9dhud.gif) all the way to the hospital. 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.katesullivanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr-gif-shocked-i7.gif) I'm sat in the hospital an hour later and Porkplanet

&gt; Telling the nurse ""I HAVEN'T EEEEEATEN ALL DAY I FEEL WEAK"".

&gt;  Nurse: I'm sure you'll survive another hour our two. 

&gt; [OFW.](http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3623/nnmdd0jpg.gif) 

&gt; FIN. 

So there you have it. The story of how my fingers broke and how Porkplanet is to blame. Hope it rustled your jimmies. Though  it was a harmless accident and she didn't mean it

**TLDR; Porkplanet comes to beach with us. Walking over rocks. Dislodges a rock 'cause she's a supernova. Rock lands on my hand. She proceeds to crush fingers further. We go to hospital. She doesn't care. Wants a McDicks.**

Oooooooh my rustling jimmies, our jimmies were still a rustling. I needed my jimmies soothed, and this came in the form of my friend TechGuy. TG is a dude, builds custom console and desktop cases etc. He is legendary. He moved into Beetus's old room at his old apartment.

The people in that apartment are B, health problems, but sound individual. And TG. Let me take you all the way back to just before Beetus moved in with us.

&gt;Be Beetus.

&gt;Be a total douche canoe

&gt;be announcing you're moving out. Give move out day of March 1st.

Landlady was still having the place renovated, but we'd have access to the flat to move in from the week prior. We tell Beetus this so he can pass the information along to his soon to be former flatmates.

&gt;Beetus doesn't.

Beetus just keeps on staying in the flat

B is all like ""Beetus

Now one might think, eventually you wait until he's out of the house, binbag everything and put it in the hallway so the person who's paying rent for that room can move in. But Beetus's beady eyes were narrowed and suspicious. He takes time off work so he doesn't have to leave his room so he can stop them doing this. He orders his groceries in, so he doesn't have to leave the flat.

Finally, Spouse-a-tron sent me away because apparently he had a 'system' for packing and he didn't want me in the way, also the dust and grit from moving would have played up my asthma something awful, and he didn't want to jeopardize my health or risk a hospital trip. So I went off to hang with friends for a couple of days to avoid the grit. (Trust me I tried to stay, but firmly got told no.)

Our friend with a car lends us his boot space to start hefting things across

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/vgnkT.gif) Beetus hasn't even packed.

&gt;[TG and B's](http://i.imgur.com/WsPEw.gif) faces when he's still in his room playing games.

&gt;Beetus isn't even worried that he hasn't packed.

&gt;Like a boss

&gt;TG and B join in to get Beetus out as quickly as possible.

&gt;B and TG even phones up friends to make it go faster.

&gt;Beetus does nothing

Everything is binbagged and boxed and finally loaded into car.

Beetus demands car comes back to pick him up even though new apartment is 15 minutes walk from the old one.

&gt;[TG and B's farewell to Beetus](http://i.imgur.com/SWRps.gif)

Back to Afterfat. Beetus has been effectively kicked out of our house. I hang out with TG and B at their flat. TG is showing me custom Iron Man helmet he's making.

&gt;Impressed

&gt;It's amazing.

&gt;Conversation moves to telling TG how Beetus left our abode last week.

&gt;TG gives me a hug

&gt;says ""I'm so glad you guys twigged on

&gt;[wut](http://i.imgur.com/vqzVz.gif)

&gt;TG points to walls of his room.

&gt;""I had to replaster everything after Beetus moved out. Sure it's an old building

&gt;Beetus had industrial sized super hefty wooden bed frame.

""The mattress was pretty much rotted through too. B said it was brand new when Beetus moved in.""

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/8aKqa.gif)

&gt;NOPENOPENOPE.

TG shows me the pantry and kitchen cupboards

""Those were his food cupboards

Brand new freezer.

""Beetus would bring home all these frozen dinners from work

&gt;Another thing they had to replace out of their own pocket.

""What did he eat then?""

""He'd order takeout while he thought we were asleep thinking we wouldn't notice or hear

&gt;Anyone wonder why Beetus was 300lbs+?

&gt;I DON'T.

TG showed me the carpet on the floor of the living room. There was a stained rectangle where a sofa had been. Apparently this wasn't colour fade

Back to the kitchen.

&gt;Be B

&gt;Be Hypoglycemic

&gt;be gluten allergic

&gt;be partially blind

&gt;be still a sound dude

&gt;be having separate toasters and bread and toastie makers for gluten free things.

Beetus used to eat my special dairy free cheese, put regular bagels in the packet. Use the gluten free toaster to toast his regular gluten sammiches.

&gt;B has had allergic reactions to this.

&gt;No hospital visits AFAIK

When asked what the hell, I DIDN'T REALIZE. I AM BLIND YOU KNOW.""**

&gt;Beetus has glasses

&gt;B is actually legally blind and wears an eyepatch over one eye because no sight.

&gt;B often upset by insensitive comments like this.

I mention the consoles being on all the time and our electrical bills

&gt;TG rolls his eyes.

&gt;When Beetus first moved in

&gt;fairenough.jpeg

&gt;When Beetus moved out they asked him to switch the account over to their names.

&gt;Beetus to my knowledge

&gt;Beetus ran up bills of 300 quid and refused to pay any more than 50 quid because when he moved in they estimated electricity would be around 100 quid a month

&gt;Nobody else in the flat had a console

&gt;as B has trouble seeing

**Side note

&gt;TG and B have had to open up a new account in their names, and the account that TG and B have is up to date and super hunky dory.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/5SX0z.gif)

&gt;allofmynope.avi

Beetus apparently took a bunch of TG's games ""by accident"" when he moved out

Two weeks later Beetus rang Spouse-a-tron at work and said he forgot some things in the house. Spouse-a-tron told him he'd have to ring me because he was at work and I was the only one home.

Beetus would apparently rather lose his stuff than speak to me so he never got in contact.

We ebayed it.

No fucks given.

**TL;DR**

Beetus caused around a thousand quid in damage to his old apartment, and purposely fucked with his flatmate's dietary allergies because ""TEEHEE OOPSIE""",SERIES,False,self,t5_2vzax,1372213188.0,,

&gt; Porkplanet has just rolled (literally) into the kitchen and into the party wearing the same exact outfit as me I bought that day. 

&gt; Ex boyfriend comes up from behind and whispers in my ear that we should come home together tonight. Ew.

&gt;  AS: Don't let it bother you. This is what she wants. Let it go. You look fabulous and she looks horrendous. Fuck knows what she was thinking. 

So for about an hour, we (the housemates) let everyone else leave first in cabs and get the last cab. In the last cab, it's me, AS, KK and Porkplanet, a long with another friend. Up until this point, she's ignored me the whole night. 

&gt; Porkplanet (squeezing her ginormous arse into the cab) ""I can't wait to daaaaance!""

&gt; Me (drunken slip): ""Nice fucking dress

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I didn't know you had the same outfit as me"". 

&gt; Me: ""Yes you fucking did.  You were there when I bought the whole outfit.  You went back and bought the same. 

&gt; AS: ""SHE'S FUCKING JEALOUS!!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""NO I'M NOT. ME AND IMGONNAMAKEIT ARE BASICALLY THE SAME SIZE ANYWAY.""

&gt; AS: ""WHAT?!""

&gt; She doesn't know that there's a 50lb (3 stone

&gt; Taxi driver: ""STOP SHOUTING.""

We sat there in silence for the whole cab drive. After five minutes, because of exboyfriend and her little act but I decide to suck it in. I'm no longer feeling fabulous and want to go home. We pay the cab and get out and join the line for the club. It's a 20 minute weight and it's almost 12 at night in January but luckily Porkplanet and I have our LOVELY AND MATCHING leather jackets to keep us warm.

&gt; Porkplanet (still sobbing

&gt; Me: ""If you wanted this dress you should of said""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I just wanted to look pretty like you do tonight"". 

&gt; Me (lying) ""You do look pretty"" (I'm going to hell) ""but it wasn't cool of you to invite exboyfriend"".

&gt; She's climbing the platform and she's about to get on the pole dancing pole. 

&gt; Me (after sprinting over to the platform): ""Porkplanet

&gt; Porkplant: ""But I'm showing the boys my pole dancing moves teeheee"". 

&gt; Me: ""You're embarassing yourself. We're going"". 

&gt; Cuteguy (approaching): ""Are we all going back to yours for more drinks and some food?""

&gt; Me: ""Well it wasn't the plan

&gt; everythingisturningoutgreatafterall.gif

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I love this song"" (swings around on pole with one arm) 

&gt; Me: ""We're going!"" 

&gt; Porkplanet falls swinging to the other side of the pole and almost launches herself off the platform

&gt; I come closer and realize she's BENT THE POLE IN THE MIDDLE. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""OH MY GOD""

&gt; Me (to Porkplanet): ""You've bent the fucking pole. Quickly come on and let's  go before anyone notices it and you get into trouble""

The crowd around the platform on the dance floor notice what she's done. Visibly laughing at her. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""It's screwed into the platform and the ceiling. How the fuck did you manage that? did you bend the ceiling  down too?!""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Shut the fuck up cuteguy it was already brokeennnnnn!"".
 
We all manage to get outside. Finally

I realize cuteguy is also hammered but holding me by my side whilst we wait for Porkplanet. Whispers he'll share the cheesy chips with me and kisses me on the neck. 

&gt; weneedtogethomerightfuckingnow.raw

Porkplanet waddles back. Everyone is flagging down cabs. We're the last to get in one. Me

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ex boyfriend. Get in"". 

Exboyfriend grins and gets in. Grinning at me. I don't think he realizes cuteguy who is sat between KK and I is going home with me

Porkplanet hands me my tray of cheesy chips and opens up her food. The smell fills the cab immediately. She has a donor kebab in pita bread

&gt; KK: ""Slow down eating that

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm STAAAAAAAARVING I NEED TO EAT""

The inevitable happens. The taxi driver speeds up. And she starts coughing. 

&gt; Me: ""Breathe porkplanet. Take a breather and stop shoving it all in"". 

She's coughing harder. Garlic mayo is spitting everywhere. Exboyfriend is sat next to her so is slapping her back folds. KK is not even helping she's laughing. Cuteguy is just sat there eating my cheesy chips. I don't  even know what's happening anymore.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm dying"". 
&gt; Me: ""You're fine. You just inhaled garlic mayo Porkplanet.""

She suddenly starts wretching because she's coughed so much. Porkplanet is a 20 a day smoker (like I was) and doesn't have the pipes to cough up the mayo that's lining her wind pipe. 

I know she's gonna blow. 

She wretches so hard she throws up into her food

&gt; Taxi Driver: ""That's gonna be £20 extra if you don't clean that up when we get to your house"".
 
&gt; I am done and this is the worst night ever. 

We eventually get home. I pay the cab driver. Everyone embarks on the house. I have to go back out with paper towels and kitchen cleaner and clean the back of the cab because Porkplanet is too drunk and still spewing everywhere in the house and being a mess. Exboyfriend has causally let himself into the house. So has cuteguy. I'm screaming a cursing in the street cleaning this cab because Porkplanet managed to get some puke all over the back of my leather jacket when waddling out of the cab. 

I go inside. Spend 30 minutes helping AS

Porkplanet wakes up next morning hangover-free

FIN. 

**TLDR; Porkplanet is called out for wearing exact same outfit as me. Cries. We make up. She makes fool of herself in club. Bends a pole dancing pole. Invites ex boyfirend home. Vomits on herself in cab and basically cock-blocks me.**** 

Thank you everyone for being so encouraging in Part 1! 

I hope Part 2 delivered.

I had to endure the endless teasing that this group of women directed towards me just to remain friends with them. One example of this happened when I was walking with one Hammy downtown

""I like the dress you're wearing now, ""Except it is really obvious you don't have any boobs!""

""Um, jimmies definitely rustled. I wore between a 32b and 32c.

""No you don't

I had a bad temper

Finally during the summer, but my friends would buy me drinks, so I didn't complain. I wore a pink minidress and heels, and I felt great. Leave it to MamaHam (we actually called her Mama), the second largest and the oldest one, to try to ruin the night for me.

A girl with us sighed dramatically as we all did makeup and hair in the same bathroom.

""Ugh

""Don't worry

The girl looked surprised but comforted. ""Yeah, so I got implants.""

""I like having small boobs, so I couldn't be too upset. My jimmies were intoxicated.

When we finally set out to the club, beer sloshing everywhere, sweat dripping, makeup running, and screaming, I was approached by a ton of guys. I danced victoriously the entire night, for hours. And MamaHam? Who was she approached by?

One guy. One guy that she was appalled by. And why was she appalled? Because he was fat.

I was finally victorious that day

Not for long

* It was a bad club
* I danced more provocatively than she did
* It was just because I was a redhead

Here's [part 1](http://redd.it/1k79gq) and [Part 2](http://redd.it/1k79gq) if you would like to read my other stoires
This is the story of my fat roommate Jacob and the daily occurrences the happened when I lived with him during my first year in University

&gt;Jacob was a 400lb 5’8 planet of a person. Constantly had Acne and believed showers were an optional occurrence . He had appetite that would put hippos to shame


&gt;He blocked the toilet the first day he moved in and on the second day ate 1kg of beacon and 10 eggs before consuming all the food I had brought believing we were sharing food


&gt;Also he out Brony  posters and Anime posters in our hallway and threaten to kick me out if I said anything about it to the University 


&gt;This is the story of what he did all day and how he believed that he was in fact good shape despite being unable to climb one flight of stairs without  losing his breathe and needing to eat a packet of chips for energy to carry on


&gt;Wake up on the third day of being in my new living arrangement


&gt;Layed back aussie bro so almost any shit couldn’t bother me in the slightest 


&gt;Jacob on the other hand was the biggest bitch you could ever imagine 


&gt;Claimed the apartment  was always to hot and it was making him sweat 


&gt;Insisted that we needed to keep the apartment  at a maximum of 18°C which for Aussies is colder than most winter days 


&gt;Don’tgiveafuck.gif


&gt;I just got a new job at the local supermarket so I wouldn’t even be using the place much


&gt;The one plus about Jacob was though he did bring a 50inch Tv to the apartment 


&gt;great I thought  AFL will be great to watch on this


&gt;oh how wrong I was 


&gt;This guy would probably watch Tv 24/7 if he didn’t need to sleep 10 hours of day 


&gt;Every day it was one of two things fucking My Little Pony or Anime where the characters have huge eyes and always over react to littlest thing to the point where it was unbearable to watch


&gt;Jacob pretty much became stuck to the couch


&gt;notevenjoking.pdf


&gt;The combination of him sweating more than a greasy wog at Bondi


&gt;When he got up it was like ripping duct tape off a wall 


&gt;I like to think of myself as a moderately fit person who likes to lift and exercise 


&gt;So I ask him “why don’t you come to the gym with me or do some exercise instead of watching TV it’ll be good for you man”


&gt;”I don’t need to exercise


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/wAS8FDG)


&gt;He believe his excuse for eating 24/7 and never doing anything is that he has a high metabolism despite having diabetes at 19 and not being able to walk to the fridge without panting 


&gt;”Umm are you sure man I don’t think it works that way you need to do an equal amount of exercise to burn the calories you eat”


&gt;”What would you know mum and dad have told me and they know best that I’m healthy and have a high metabolism that’s why I’m able to eat hat ever I want and never get fat


&gt;At this point I walk out of the room try to contain myself from pissing my pants 


&gt;hear the rustle of him opening another packet of chips to consume while I decide there and then I need to go for a run to ensure his fucktard logic doesn’t infect me

Spouse-a-tron and I are going away for the weekend for a LRP event. We'll be spending the weekend at a scout camp running through mucky forests and fields

&gt;Beetus has decided he is going with mumsy dearest and his three sisters to the Lake District for the week

&gt;we've had the house to ourselves since Monday

&gt;It's now Friday and we're packed up and ready to go.

I make a last check through the house and that smell is emanating through the house from Beetus's room. It's the smell of nope and despair. A sad pathetic smell that says ""I have no girlfriend and I never will."" We almost feel bad for him. Almost. He's not scheduled to be back until Monday

&gt;executive decision made

Let's give his room an airing. I carefully jump in and have to climb over the bed to reach the window so I can raise the blind and open it just a crack. We have someone house sitting, ps3 and xbox on again.

&gt;&gt;Lookit there

&gt;&gt;must have been a power outtage.

&gt;&gt;TEEHEE.MOTHERFUCKER

We leave, enjoying rousing games of ""knock the pint off the giant's head"" and trying Goblin Brave Juice (Super chilli vodka).  I get a subtle ""COME HERE"" gesture from Spouse-a-tron, to come to our room. He's holding his phone at a distance, and even over the noise and rumble in the other room, I can hear screaming on the phone.

""Who is it?""

&gt;3 guesses.

&gt;it's not the Queen telling me I'm a lost member of the Royal Family.

&gt;Nor is it the President awarding me a Medal of Honour for having to endure Beetus.

&gt;It's Beetus.

Beetus is screaming and has been so for the past 25 minutes about how I have invaded his privacy and gone through his stuff. Seems he came home early from the Lake District

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/rHzXM.gif) he's threatening lawsuit

&gt;Yeah right. Bitchplease.asianguy

Landlady, he's made some classic sexist comments to her such as when she invited us over for dinner, she told us she was making beef curry and we got excited because she makes excellent curry. His reaction? **""Big fucking whoop, some chick making food, it's not like that doesn't ever happen.""** muttered under his breath so loud I'm pretty sure the house next door heard it.

So she's been itching for an excuse to give him the official boot for some time.

We quell his russling jimmies and say we'll talk about it when we get home, if Beetus kicks him out again, we're having serious discussions about flatmate status.

His jimmies are only briefly restrained. We hurried home the next afternoon. Beetus is squealing that we didn't clear anything with him.

&gt;I texted him about it. Asked him if he had any objections

&gt;No response

&gt;He blocked my number

&gt;I showed him text as proof.

&gt;Claims it's faked.

&gt;HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FAKE A DATE AND TIME STAMP ON MY SHITTY HTC?

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/vZ0Nv.gif)

As I try to explain this concept to Beetus

Beetus is mid rant

&gt;I had started work again

&gt;weight was dropping

&gt;145lbs

&gt;Had just spent a weekend running through rough terrain and sword fighting. 

&gt;Beetus had sat in a 5 star hotel, who dote on him

&gt;doubt he so much as lifted a finger by himself all weekend.

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/vqzVz.gif)

Landlady arrives mid rant. Spouse-a-tron is confused how he suddenly got sexist. He'd never seen or heard Beetus make any overly sexist comments to me. Beetus was careful to never say them in front of Spouse-a-tron.

Beetus is telling us how I'm just some little slut-trumpet (This is actually one of my favourite names now) who was so insecure about my weight and my fat ugly ass that I was taking it out on people with *REAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS* to make myself feel better. Landlady doesn't even blink

It says **30 Days Notice to Vacate** on the top in bold

Beetus is gobsmacked. He sputters

&gt;404 Response Not Found

Beetus flails madly

&gt;[WUT](http://i.imgur.com/SpVoNhy.gif)

&gt;hurrah.gif

&gt;I think?

Beetus tells Spouse-a-tron **""I don't know what you see in that slut

As previously mentioned

&gt;5'4

&gt;dresses really well and manages to look a LOT smaller than she is.

&gt;moves gracefully

&gt;Eats healthy

&gt;Is an utter and complete boss.

*""Beetus, all you do is sit around and play video games, and I know for a fact you don't bathe. You are at fault in this situation and you are lucky we haven't sought legal action for your conduct with the break in.""*

Beetus don't give a fuck.

**""FUCKING LOSERS

Locks himself in his room. Moves out that Friday.

&gt;good riddance

We inspected his room ""officially"" with Landlady. Before we moved in house was newly renovated. New plaster on walls, new carpet, new everything. Four months of Beetus, and we had to deep clean the walls, which were sweating, had mould growing in the corners from where he'd left bin bags of rubbish and rotting food to just grow. Mattress had to get deep cleaned and sterilized, and the carpet had to be totally shampoo'd and cleaned. The door also had to be rehung because his fatass broke it.

We found that out of spite

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Next Time on The Fatmate**

We hear further stories of Fattitude from his previous flatmates.

Your Jimmies will russle like NEVER before!

Tl;DR: Fat flatmate gets inordinately enraged at me for opening a window to air out his room and ""touching his stuff"". Moves out ASAP in order to avoid being kicked out.",self,t5_2vzax,1372213202.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gg4q9/the_fatmate_part_iii/

Fast forward to a few months after moving in.

We started noticing a smell coming from Beetus's room. Not just a little musty, untidy is one thing, filth is another thing completely.

&gt;[sweating walls.](http://i.imgur.com/JFfLfAn.gif)

&gt;piles of unwashed clothes

&gt;Beetus never washed them ever

&gt;about 2/3s of our cultery, bowls and dishes are all in his room caked with nope.

&gt;Bin bags full of nope.

&gt;I'm pretty sure they moved.

&gt;[NOPE NOPE NOPE.](http://i.imgur.com/fMiwV8h.gif)

Shortly after movie night there was The Battle of the Xbox

&gt;Xbox

I think back on our electrical bill

&gt;This is so not even funny.

&gt;save each game

&gt;Beetus gets home eventually and notices all his stuff is off.

&gt;throws massive hissy fit at me

&gt;Says I'm a chick

**""YOU MAY THINK IT'S OK TO DO THIS TO PEOPLE

&gt;Don't push it

&gt;so pissed off.

I go to a friend's house to hang out because I can't even handle the crazy. While there, and I get a call from Landlady.

""WHAT HAPPEND TO THE HOUSE?""

""Um, what's going on?""

""BEETUS JUST POSTED ON FACEBOOK THAT SOMEONE BROKE IN.""

**""*WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK?*""**

I check facebook, I can't get off work.""

&gt;works as overnight support for disabled folk.

I tell my friends what's happened and I have to rush off. They all give me money for cab

""Ok what did the police say?""

**""Oh

&gt;[No no we should just let this go like nothing happened.](http://i.imgur.com/aSlzdoF.jpg)

""Fucking yes we should call the police! did they take anything?""

**""Nothing important seems missing""**

I make a quick rundown of the flat. My brand new ipod classic (a month old) is missing, a few of my DVDs and an old broken phone belonging to Spouse-a-tron. Make this list. Call police.

**""I don't know why you're so upset

&gt;[nothing important](http://i.imgur.com/29zDOC5.gif)

&gt;you mean none of your stuff

That look on his face. It's slightly off.

Police come round, after some time they get message showing that the security cameras around the area show her going in the back door.

""Someone must have left a door unlocked

Beetus is already establishing how SECURITY CONSCIOUS he is.

**""I KNOW OFFICER, if I get too scared. I don't want anyone stealing my food.""**

&gt;I left that door locked when I left. I double checked both doors and all the windows. I was on the phone with Landlady while I did it. She heard me and everything.

Police leave

&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/29zDOC5.gif) I realise Beetus left the back door open on purpose.

Total value of items stolen: $650

Spouse-a-tron gives him benefit of doubt

Landlady spring $150 on new locks and keys because we briefly had a theory that the woman had keys from the previous owners

**TL;DR**

Beetus gets mad because I try to conserve electricity while I find out about his horrific nuclear fallout zone of a room, causes landlady's insurance on house to go up.

Oh and when we ""discussed"" this with him he was like ""Oh you've got your stuff insured, tv, etc.

&gt; While ringing up her stuff

&gt; katdennings starts to answer but her breath is taken away by a the stench emanating from the feed-hole of the mobile lard tub behind her. 

&gt; ""Stopp hittin' on that gurl and gett to werk""

&gt; Be me

&gt; katdennings takes it in stride and says ""I think he is just being nice ma'am""

&gt; Be glad she was able to discern the lard tubs gender. misterysolved.jpg

&gt; Lard tub makes facial expression

&gt; Theres one other person in line

&gt; Awkward silence follows in which the only sound is me scanning 
groceries at lightspeed. 

&gt; katdennings gives me wary smile and leaves

&gt; farewell and shysmile.jpg

&gt; Her cart is full of absolute garbage.

Life

Porcina, and her recovery was very swift. Although the growth had not been to blame for her unhealthy weight – a topic of much discussion by her doctor –  it had been a partial cause of her antisocial behavior (though not the only culprit). Follow-up visits to a psychologist would provide her with further improvements, one step of which – as she herself explained – was to take responsibility for herself. She was also given the relieving news that she did not, in fact, suffer from herpes, nor any other evident infection. When asking about the self-appraised abdominal blisters she had noticed on herself, Porcina was advised to discontinue use of a certain hair-removal product. She remains a ""bigger girl, but adopted healthier habits and has dropped down several sizes. More importantly than that

Jeff and I are still very close friends, have an adventure of his own, and it would be my turn to offer sage advice.

Aaron and Porcina drifted apart, ""Stranger things have happened."" His job with a well-known software company has him traveling across the globe, but when back at home, he moonlights as an amateur musician. 

He's still weird.

Lauren and I dated for several months after that. We ended things amicably, there was the tiny issue of time. Spring classes resumed with a vengeance that year, and Lauren took on a second job so that she could keep saving for the future and still pay the rent for her solitary apartment. She did, obviously, end up moving out, though she and Porcina stayed close. Their matching tattoo, for anyone who is interested, three-dimensional figure – set between each of their shoulder blades. Lauren showed me hers a few weeks after our first date. It is *not*

As for me, committed relationships, until I met a girl who left Lauren in the dust. 

I eventually came to understand that anything negative about us – whether it's a temper, but after everything is said and done, we can only worry about being the best that *we* can be, and letting other folks have the same freedom. We're all just people, living out our lives and hoping for the best.

I find that it helps to keep in mind: Even the worst experiences end.

And so

Hamela Anderson went to college with us, and more or less in the same social circle. Her face looked like [Bev Bighead from Rocko's Modern Life](http://images.wikia.com/rockosmodernlife/images/7/77/Thumb-bev.jpg) and she was very...rotund (like seriously, 300 pounds). For some reason, since day one Hamela did NOT like me. Probably because I'm a skinny anorexic bitch, but whatever. 

This story happened my senior year of college. Roommate is a very skinny, Roommate and I decided to stay in and do our own thing. 

He eventually wanders into my room. ""So...Hamela Anderson has been texting me all night."" My response? ""Ew."" ""Yeah, etc. Roommate goes back to his room. I go back to doing whatever the heck I was doing.

Roommate comes back in. ""Hey

About an hour or so later, and the sounds of that terrible TEE HEE giggling fill the apartment. Hamela Anderson is in my apartment. I sneak a peak to see Roommate corralling her towards his bathroom.

Not wanting to start World War III, he drove the five minutes to our apartment. Knowing that Hamela Anderson hates me and that I hate vomit, he said that she was going to crash on his futon. I make some joke about not getting her pregnant, he tells me to go fuck myself, we both drift off peacefully into dreamland.

The next morning I hear giggling coming from Roommate's room. I quickly GTFO...I don't need to be here for this. 

When I returned to the apartment later that afternoon, I heard some sexytime noises coming from your room this morning!"" ""SHUT UP I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!""

I bribed him with beer and food and he eventually opened up. Roommate had been having a good dream...a REAL GOOD DREAM (if ya know what I mean). But then he woke up. To find Hamela Anderson giving him a blow job. He sat up

After I finished laughing about it (sorry Roommate) I realized that what Hamela Anderson did was actually really wrong and that he should probably report it. He just sat there

After she disputes the charges for 20 min threatening with ""bad yelp reviews"" the server told her that if she didn't pay for it that the server herself would have to pay for it and that that wasn't going to happen because if she didn't pay for the cake the police would be called.

Don't you love us anymore? You are killing yourself by inches and every time I see you I remember the wonderfully fun person you used to be; all the fun I had growing up with you; all the lessons you taught me about growing up and coping with other people. But now

I remember playing video games with you. We'd sit down together with the console, then go outside and you taught me how to ride my bike. Now your fingers are too swollen to get around a game controller. They're purple at the tips, and you literally cannot feel the buttons on the keyboard. Clicking a mouse is a slow and painful process for you. I taught my sister how to ride a bike, because you couldn't keep up chasing after her.

I remember you've always been a champion snorer. You'd saw logs and shake the walls - very very helpful for a teenager sneaking out of bed at 1 in the morning. Mom slept with earplugs. Now when I visit you, gulping for air. Mom sleeps in a different room now. She still wears the earplugs, but I hear her praying during the silences, hoping you'll start breathing again.

I remember you walking me down the aisle to give me away on my wedding day. Your face was red by the time we got to the alter. I knew you weren't crying. You sat gratefully down in the front pew and wiped the sweat from your brow with the handkerchief in your breast pocket. Are you going to be there for my sister's wedding? Or the birth of your first grandchild?

I remember eating breakfast with you before school every morning. You'd wink at me as you put a couple extra spoonfuls of sugar on your Frosting-Coated Made-Of-Corn-Flakes. Now I see you check your blood sugar at breakfast. 350. I count four tablespoons of sugar going onto half a box of cereal. You're still eating Sugar-Frosting Made-of-Corn-Flakes

I remember going to your brother's funeral. He was forty-three when he died from a massive heart attack. You got kidney stones the night of the wake and went to the hospital. You ended up getting emergency double bypass surgery because you couldn't even walk down the hall to get the ultrasound. I thought we were going to have a double funeral that weekend.

We've tried so hard to help you. Mom is a great cook, fresh fruit. You left them in the refrigerator. So I put them in your briefcase. You made me take out the trash, and I see the piles of brown bag lunches in the garbage can, still full. You try to hide them under the McBeetus bags, the wrappers from candy bars, the packages of beef jerkey.

Yesterday, cracking skin. You stumbled over the gravel driveway, your insensate feet plodding and waddling to a bench in the shade. My sisters went tubing down the river. I stayed with you, talking. Catching up. Fetching your glasses of water to try and beat the heat. I want to get the time in now, while I still can.

You taught me to be strong

You taught me to be stubborn

You taught me to love life

Now, I don't hate fat people at all and was perfectly friendly and eager to get to know my new flatmate, as were Ben and Max. The first inkling any of us had that this was going to be a trying year for us all was when Jabba looked at the TV during the battle of Hoth and said ""What are you guys watching?"".

First week of semester, so he sat at home turning our couch cushions concave.

I'm very much into cooking and try and lead a healthy lifestyle. I have a couple of expensive cooking knives (Shun

One day

Fast forward a week and I come home from class early with Max and see my knife in Jabba's greasy hands cutting apart a big hunk of meat with the bone in. I immediately ask him what he is doing and he replies nonchalantly ""Just cooking lunch"". So I ask him what he is doing with my knife that was in my room and he tells me it was just on the bench and there were no other clean knives

This is when Jabba loses his shit he bellows with the power of an old church organ covered in a slick film of greasy cheeto sweat ""YOU CAN'T FUCKING ACCUSE ME OF TAKING YOUR SHIT. HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR SHIT LYING AROUND

This is when shit gets messy, and a 2.5 inch cut opens up quickly and deeply. He freaks out and starts shouting that I stabbed him and he goes off to the bathroom screaming about how he is calling the cops.

Meanwhile

The cops show up about 15 minutes later see Jabba's very fleshy wound and I get arrested before I manage to plead my case and placed in the back seat of the cop car

Jabba goes and gets his wound stitched and upon returning says I owe him for the bill and he is moving out

A little background story. I am a brain cancer survivor. I had 6 brain surgeries last year, take out the tumor, replace the piece of skull, and anchor the skull flap in place with multiple titanium plates. Not surprisingly, all of that left me with several complications. Among them are:

-I have seizures if I overexert myself.

-One side of my body is partially paralyzed (like that of a stroke survivor). The medical term for this is hemiparesis.

-That same side of my body is constantly in excruciating pain. My pain doctor told me that my particular flavor of chronic pain ranks up there with bone cancer pain. Basically

-I am EXTREMELY fatigued most of the time. Most of my fatigue stems from my recovery from those brain surgeries

Because of this staggering list of condishuns



With that in mind

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be going to the grocery store because my refrigerator is nearly empty and I need to eat food on a daily basis (teehee).

&gt;I spot an open handicapped spot near the entrance! This is rare where I live - and surprisingly rare in many places around the country - for reasons that will become clear.

&gt;Realize the solar eclipse is actually a hamwhale. Hamwhales in adjacent handicapped spots are glaring at me as well.

&gt;""Uhh

&gt;Snort. ""What kind of excuse is that. I have a REAL condishun. My blood sugar gets low and I can't move good. At least you can walk. There are people who need this spot more than you!""

I work in a mostly female office. The women there who are not too old to be pregnant are in general, from the ""eating for two"" myth (moar like eating for 10 right?), to ""anything you eat in the first half of the day does not count, because you burn it all before you go to sleep at night. (WTF?) 

So today we are in our office, we never have drills, it never accidentally goes, I have never heard it in all my time there. Our office is also inside a larger building and does not have quick or easy access to the outside. 

So everyone starts to speedwalk to the exit, and heads BACK INTO THE DAMN OFFICE! ""Cheddarbun what is wrong?!"" I go back in to make sure she gets back out while everyone heads outside to see what is on fire. I come across her at her cubicle pulling a bag of arby's out. This was at 10am, and she had eaten a bag of mcdonald's when she got to the office, as she does every morning.

She ran back into the building...pregnant....during a fire alarm...to grab her bag of Arby's.

Oh my god! Why did you come back for this crap?!!  ""We don't know how long we will have to wait outside and i'm getting hungry.""

I walked her back out and told my co-workers what had happened

I am 19; I have a mom a dad and an older sister (20 years old). When we were young my parents got a divorce. My mother took care of my sister and I lived with my father. 
My father was a military man, neither woman did anything and were both obese. 
Now this story begins after I receive an acceptance letter to a prestigious school. Unfortunately, it was about a thirty minute drive from my mom’s house. My mom offered me residence in her home so I could commute (saved a lot of money). 
**Start**
&gt;Arrive at mom’s house during the summer

&gt;Haven’t seen mom and sister since last year

&gt;Mom picks me up from the airport

&gt;Drive home is a bit awkward

&gt;We arrive

&gt;I unload my luggage no one helps

&gt;I move my luggage to the guest room
 
&gt;Mom: Ares what do you think you are doing!

&gt;Me: I am unpacking my clothes

&gt;Mom: You aren’t supposed to stay in the guest room. It’s in case someone comes over

&gt;Me: Sure thing

&gt;She leaves and mutters under her breath
I move into my sister’s room she is pissed that she has to share it with me but w/e.  

&gt;Comes dinner time

&gt;I go downstairs to see what is cooking

&gt;Shocked

&gt;Mom is cooking what appears to be a Giant’s Cauldron

&gt;On the counter are sticks of butter that are being thrown one by one into the pot
Eris: you are going to love mom’s cooking

&gt;MFW only vegetable that was added was a pinch of dried oregano

**FAT LOGIC Weight loss tip** Vegetables of any kind magically negate calories

&gt;I don’t want to be rude so I take a generous amount of food and start eating.

&gt; I watch Mom and Eris devour down their portions 

&gt;They get more and more and compete with each other to eat as much as possible 

[Artist’s depiction of the event]( http://i.imgur.com/JDmj0n8.jpg)

 They ate their food so quickly that they would sometimes have to stop to catch their breath 

&gt;I finish my food and leave the dinner table

&gt;Eris: Are you trying to lose weight Ares?

&gt;Me: No I had more than my fair share. Thank you mom the food was delicious.


&gt;Mom: you can have more Hunny its good for you

&gt;Me: okay I’ll have a bit more

&gt;Finish eating

&gt;Go upstairs start working on cover letter for an internship/job at the University

&gt;Eris starts watching her favorite show

&gt;W/e I ignore and do my best to work

&gt;Eris and I get called down about 2 hours after dinner 

&gt;Mom hands me a plate of chicken strips, and a piece of lettuce 

&gt;Me: Mom what is this?

&gt;Mom: Night time salad

&gt;Me: it just adds more calories to what we already ate


&gt;Mom: I know you think you know everything

&gt;Me: I know salad is good for you but that’s only if you use it in place of your other meals

&gt;Mom: Look I just add some meat so you can get your protein

&gt;Me: I don’t really believe that guy

&gt;I look at Eris and Mom’s face… I done goofed …these guys worship the [Great Oz]( http://i.imgur.com/iSZcBqP.jpg). 

&gt;I look around they have every fish oil, that this man sells.

&gt;Mom: when you become a doctor you can tell people how to eat

&gt;Me: I really don’t have any room

&gt;Mom snatches the plate from me and throws it into the sink and starts cursing

&gt; I run upstairs oh shit what have I done

&gt;I stay a bit upstairs then later go downstairs to apologize to mom 

&gt;Eris starts talking to me while she eats her ‘salad’ with a fuck ton of dressing

&gt;Me: you guys are pretty serious on the dieting

&gt;Eris: not everyone can be born with a body like yours; some people have to work for it

&gt;Eris: just because you are skinny doesn’t mean you know what is best for dieting

&gt;Me: I don’t think I do

&gt;Eris: Where did you hear that?

&gt;Me: It’s a fundamental law of physics

&gt;Eris: Look just because you go to __________ doesn’t mean you are some fancy physicist

&gt;I give up and just continue working

&gt;I fall asleep

&gt;However I wake up in the middle of the night to loud noises

&gt;Fucking Eris

&gt;This is some ridiculous shit

&gt;I dare not interrupt a behemoth that is aroused 

&gt;Try my hardest and eventually fall asleep

First days were rough

&gt;Come back and fall straight asleep one night

&gt;Wake up middle of the night to loud moaning

&gt;Holy shit she is fapping so loud it’s as if she wants me to wakeup

&gt;Upon closer inspection she is using my laptop WTF!!

&gt;Turn on the lights

&gt;Me: what are you doing with my laptop? 

&gt;She slams my laptop shut

&gt;Eris: sorry ‘Tee-hee’ my computer was being really slow so I used your computer

&gt;Me: Look I have a lot of important documents on that

&gt;She agrees I go back to sleep but she continues with her fapping.

&gt;Next morning I get supplies to clean her laptop (compressed air

&gt;Computer is loaded with dust

&gt;Start clearing the 2000 tool bars

&gt;Start checking her internet history… I lost it

&gt;Here are some of the notable searches…daddy daughter; brother sister; how to give a blow job; Shane Diesel; Simpsons porn; Mexican cartel beheading video; Game of Thrones Incest; Blondes on Blacks.

&gt;I was disgusted

&gt;She says she will be more careful

&gt;World goes on I start spending more and more time away from home as I get settled into the area. 

&gt;I come home purely to sleep and a lot of nights I spend at friends’ houses.

&gt;Mom and sister aren’t too happy about this and they think that I am acting arrogant because I have a job. To be fair I was but it wasn’t so much that I thought of myself highly

&gt;Mom demands that Eris and I have some brother and sister bonding.

&gt;I reluctantly agree…

**End**
Thank you FPS for lending me your ears
**TLDR**
Move into with mom and older sister for college. They are fat worthless pieces of shit and are jealous of me.

So after my glorious introduction to her drugged up fiance, so word spreads faster than RW's ever-expanding waistline.

By this point in my interaction with RW

This is actually a sad story

&gt; At work (do I really need to keep saying that? That's the only time I interact with this whale)

&gt; RW isn't working today! The whole store feels lighter from the lack of her gravitational pull

&gt; Feel a lurch in the force! Earthquake?!

&gt; lol bitch

&gt; RW rolls up in the store

To note, counting various monies, as well as assisting customers. I don't have a lot of down time.

&gt; RW ""Viza I don't know what to do-ooo-oooo-oooooo.""

&gt; The breaks are for her sobs. She's not crying

&gt; Trying to do my job bitch

&gt; Don't want to be rude in front of customers

&gt; ""What's wrong RW? You look like someone died."" Or threw away the rest of your pizza (as if there are leftovers)

&gt; ""Jonah just asked me to let his friend move in with us! I'm just really not comfortable with it. I don't know this guy and I think he's on *drugs*.""

&gt; HAHA

&gt; ""You said no

&gt; RW ""Of *course* I said no. But Jonah is insistent that he moves in. He said we need to get our own house so that we won't have to worry about mom anymore.""

&gt; ""...RW your mom *needs* your help. You can't just abandon her and buy a house so your fiance's druggie friend can move in.""

&gt; RW ""I *know* that. Can you even imagine the food bills for feeding another person? And having to pay mortgage? I don't make enough to cover that!""

&gt; You don't make enough to cover your own food bill plus mortgage.

&gt; ""So just tell him no. I don't see why it's a problem.""

&gt; RW ""It's a problem because Jonah and I NEVER FIGHT. We discuss things sometimes

My then boyfriend, don't tell him I said that). Not fighting seems absolutely foreign to me. You're two different people. You have different opinions. You are *going to fight*.

&gt; A wild G appears! (to refresh

&gt; G ""If you let him move in

&gt; RW ""Jonah doesn't *have a problem* except for bad choices in friends.""

&gt; And women.

&gt; G ""Whether you want to see it or not

S being our pharmacy tech.

&gt; RW ""He's NOT on DRUGS. He's just worn down because he hasn't had proper food because of his ex-wife starving him! He'll be fine once he starts gaining weight!""

&gt; G ""Gaining weight ain't gonna help his problem. And you adding food addiction on top of drug addiction will just make things worse.""

&gt; RW actually laughs at this point

&gt; How can you laugh during a conversation like this?

&gt; RW ""There's no such thing as food addiction. We need food to live and to be healthy.""

&gt; G ""We do, he's getting what you force into his skeleton face.""

&gt; I love you

&gt; RW ""I am so TIRED of everyone giving me hell because I know how to eat properly! G you look like you haven't had a proper meal since 1945

&gt; Just shoot me now

&gt; We live in the country

&gt; Anybody?

&gt; Sigh. ""Getting back on topic here, and no one needs a drug addict friend living with them. Just put your foot down"" (try not to break the floor) ""and tell him no.""

&gt; RW ""Ugh

&gt; all of my wat

&gt; How do you even make that statement after what I said?

&gt; Whale logic

&gt; G ""You leave Viza alone

&gt; RW starts leaking salt water from her pores

&gt; Or crying

&gt; RW ""Skinny people always gang up on me! I don't even know why I came in here! I'm going to talk to my *real friends* about this because they'll understand without backstabbing me!""

&gt; RW makes a hasty (haha) exit

&gt; G shakes her head ""I know exactly why that man is with her.""

&gt; omgtellmemoar

&gt; G ""He thinks her momma has money, but who gives a shit about that. That girl is going to be devastated and eat herself into a coma.""

&gt; ""Are you just speculating

&gt; G shakes her head ""I know everyone in this town. I've heard talk.""

&gt; Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayum...

&gt; G ""I tried to warn her about him before. About how strange his divorce was and how fast they were moving. But you know she won't hear it.""

&gt; ""Yeah

&gt; G ""Does she talk to you like that often? About your weight and your man?""

&gt; ""Pretty much everyday.""

&gt; G ""Next time it happens

&gt; G winks and goes back to work

END PART 3

TL;DR - Fiance's drug addicted friend wants to move in, me and G are bitches because we're not huge cows

&gt;NSLDB is feasting on what was once a great table of goodies

&gt;Cookies, and grapes (gotta stay healthy, tee hee!) are all strewn about as his gaping maw devours everything that approaches it

&gt; ""...Don't you think you're moving a little fast?""

&gt; RW violently explodes like I have never seen before

&gt; RW ""You have NO ROOM to lecture me on what to do in my own personal LIFE! You're living in SIN with your boyfriend! You don't know anything about Jonah

&gt; ""If he's moving in with you

&gt; RW ""Hah

&gt; ""Yeah

&gt; RW ""Unlike *some* people, since I know how to cook. He also couldn't keep his hands off me, so he obviously has good taste in delicate, feminine woman.""

&gt; Delicate as a fucking cactus

&gt; ""RW

&gt; RW ""It's not rude! Everything I'm saying is absolutely correct! You *need* to know how to cook to keep your man happy. And *you* need to put on weight

&gt; TOO FAR

&gt; ""If you don't shut up right now

For the intro to the horror

This is a long one about the further suffering of our couch, and our car, but it sets up for the grand finale. 

Last time, and I making the fateful decision to allow this she-beast into our precious living space. In all fairness, we thought it would work out for the first week or so. She brought a new table for the kitchen (red flag 1) and about $500 worth of groceries (red flag 2). At this time, she had also declared herself a full-fledged vegetarian (other than the occasional accidentally-inhaled rodent, I assume). 

At this point, and I could go a month on about $500 worth of groceries. We weren’t eating like kings, but we weren’t starving either. Barfield (thanks, dear reader, for that brilliant nickname) came with this cornucopia and told us we were welcome to share it all. We were surprised, as this is uncommon for hamplanets, but pleasantly so. We extended her the same courtesy. 

The following events happened the first day Barfield moved in. 

I’ll admit

&gt; Hearing noises from the other room

&gt; “Barfield

&gt; “Mmmmghghcmcmmmmmmmhhmmmph”

&gt; “I beg your pardon?” 

&gt; Barfield takes a moment to swallow her momentous bite. 

&gt; “Oh

I knew I wasn’t going to like what I saw when I went into the living room

&gt; “Are you eating whole heads of broccoli?” 

&gt; “Well yeah

&gt; “Did you finish that bottle of dressing?” 

&gt; “Yeah

There was Barfield, an empty grocery bag on her lap, and one last stalk of broccoli in her giant, meaty fist. I had just bought that stuff (a pile of broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, roast beef

&gt; “Listen

&gt; “God, so I figured you wouldn’t mind. Besides, I’m just trying to be *healthy*.” 

I have never heard anyone say the word “skinny” with such utter disdain. As if being thin is a disease. I just stood there, your eating habits are not my responsibility and I don't care if you're trying to be healthy or not.  

&gt; In disgust

&gt; Watching in horror as the couch groans

&gt; Step back as the floor groans

&gt; Barfield walks past me with a sniff

&gt; the mangled broccoli stem and slimy dressing bottle are sitting on the couch

&gt; no plate

&gt; she ate a week’s worth of food with her hands

&gt; beta move

Skinny, so we all pile in to go to our favorite Chinese food joint. For the record, this is a *full-sized* sedan. We’ve put four people in the back seat with no problems. We park in our usual spot in the alley nearby and everyone started to get out… except Barfield. 

&gt; “Why is your car so small?”

&gt; “Ummmmm….”

&gt; “I mean seriously

The door was open all the way. It couldn’t go any wider

We ate at this place all the time, we’d have four or five meals’ worth of food (we’re big on leftovers). So we sit down, order the usual (beef with broccoli, pork fried rice, fried noodles with shrimp, fried pork chops, and some grilled fish), not two

&gt; Waiters start to bring food to the table

&gt; Barfield’s eyes get wide

&gt; Before they can even finish setting down these big

&gt; She starts eating out of it… with the serving spoon

&gt; None of us know how to politely point out that she was using a serving spoon

&gt; Needless to say

&gt; Barfield starts in on her vegetarian dishes

&gt; “This isn’t that great

&gt; Ok

&gt; Barfield then decides that the problem is with the vegetarian dishes

&gt; Again, for the ironclad manners we were exhibiting in the face of this outrage. 

&gt; Just like with the lasagna

&gt; She only stops when the table is empty. I mean marrow-sucked-out-of-the-pork-bones empty. She had yet again eaten more than enough food to feed the three of us for a week in just one sitting. 

&gt; The check comes, we pay. 

At this point, he asked her about her meal. 

&gt; “I thought you were a vegetarian

&gt; “Oh I am

&gt; “A little treat? Of a pile of meat? Which you ate with a serving spoon?”

&gt; Barfield’s feelings are clearly hurt and she looks to Skinny and me for help

&gt; We look at Cranky

So for the second time

&gt; get back to the apartment

&gt; retreat to our own rooms to avoid confrontation

&gt; suddenly

&gt; a noise like thunder and the end of the world

&gt; Barfield is in the shower

&gt; and I imagine parts of the shower must have been in Barfield

&gt; it’s a stall shower

&gt; yes

&gt; how well is that marble attached to the wall? 

&gt; she gets out and knocks on my door

&gt; “I want the other bathroom.” 

Skinny and I shared a bathroom with a full-sized shower and Cranky had shared the other bathroom with our departed fourth roommate. When Barfield moved in

&gt; “Why?”

&gt; I know perfectly well why. 

&gt; I know your gigantic circumference is greater than the perimeter of that shower stall.  

&gt; “Because I’m bigger than either of you

&gt; Wrong. Not giving up my bathroom. Not for fatlogic

&gt; “Well

&gt; “You’re just being a bitch because you’re so tiny.”

&gt; What? Science: bitchiness is directly correlated with small size

&gt; “Either way

&gt; Cranky is watching from the door to his room

&gt; Barfield stomps off; pictures jump off the walls. 

&gt; It has been one day

This story takes place one summer night in July 2012.

&gt; Be me, take care of myself, watch what I eat and how much I eat.

&gt; Don’t Be GhasFa

&gt; Camping at Sandbanks with some friends from school. (Sandbanks is a Provincial Park in Ontario. White sandy beaches

&gt; Setting up our tents, the coolers, the beer, the campfire, the food.

&gt; I’ve done this camping thing before and I brought along an extra tarp to put under and over my tent

&gt; Sweet! All set up and ready to roll. Start cooking the pre-marinated steaks over the open fire

&gt; Some of the late comers to our party show up around 8pm. It’s starting to get dark but they have at least 30 minutes to set up their sites with daylight quickly disappearing.

&gt; Enter GhasFa; the definition of Rolly Polly. As she gets out of her car the tires breathe a sigh of relief

&gt; “Hi Guys! What’s going on?” she says as another friend chimes in and says “We’re just getting ready for the night. Setting up our tents and whatnot

&gt; “OHHHH, cheese bread, candy, and cheese.”

Here we are thinking that she brought the turkey to share with everyone. We were all looking at each other impressed because she did this.

&gt; “Thanks for bringing a turkey

&gt; “Sorry guys

&gt; “Ohh

Anyway

&gt; I walk around the cars only to see she has taken the tarp over my tent. Great

&gt; She announces proudly “I did. You already have enough tarps and I forgot mine. I didn’t think you’d mind.” (Notice the lack of apology)

&gt; I get a little miffed but whatever, eat, swim, and drink some more. Maybe combinations of them all, too.

&gt; I help her put up her tent

&gt; We finish and then she goes off and gets her food all prepared. I decide to go for a dip sneak off with my girlfriend for some dippin-skinny. My gf was 5’11 and maybe 155lbs. I never asked, none-the-less.

&gt; It starts to rain and so we make our way out of the water, we’re covered by trees and it’s turning out to be a wicked night. Little spurts of rain here and there but it’s a sticky 28degrees Celsius at 11pm. (About 82F) Pretty humid too.

&gt; At about 3am, so I lay in my nice dry sleeping bag with my girlfriend next to me. Beauty night, great sleep. I get up to go make eggs and bacon for everybody.

&gt; My car is uncovered with the driver’s window STILL WIDE OPEN. The tarp covering it is missing. I shout out a very loud “FUCK” and people start to gather around to see what’s up. The inside of my car is soaked. Everything in it? Soaked. My laptop? Soaked. My clothes? Soaked. EVERYTHING is drenched and still dripping.

&gt; GhasFa makes her way around the line of cars and says “What’s up everybody? Why does everyone look so panicked?”

At this point

&gt; “Someone took my tarp last night and left my car window open. They keys are right there IN THE IGNITION and whoever took it

&gt; “Shitty.” She says. “I’m starving. Did someone mention breakfast?”

I brush it off; I’ll deal with it later. I’m too livid right now to be so stressed with nothing in my system. Go back behind my buddies car to grab the bacon

&gt; I look up at GhasFa’s tent and notice a second tarp over her tent. It took a while to register but when it did – I exploded.

&gt; “GhasFa! Did you take the tarp off my car? Why the fuck would you do that without closing my goddamn window? You ruined EVERYTHING INSIDE.”

&gt; She says “Well it started to rain and then I noticed my cooler (plastic

&gt; “We were listening to music all night

&gt; “Well

FTR

&gt; “I had the second tarp over the car to protect the inside from the rain so we could keep the window open and listen to music!”

&gt; “Well you shouldn’t have left your window open then. Not my fault!” then she jaunts off to go make her own breakfast.

Now

&gt; My gf goes off and confronts her. “GhasFa

&gt; She defends herself and says only “MY FOOD!” 

&gt; We all go off and start drying out the damaged goods from the car and salvage what is salvageable... which turns out to be about 10% of the stuff in my car and just happened to be the 10% that I didn’t care about.

&gt; GhasFa waddles over and by noon, “Didn’t you bring a TURKEY?” GhasFa says “Well yeah but I got hungry last night...”

&gt; Everyone in almost perfect unison shouts “You’re on your own!” then walks away shaking their heads.

&gt; We all go swimming and leave GhasFa to herself. We actually had a pretty enjoyable day at the beach. Got a nice tan

&gt; Sun starts to set and we get hungry. We headed back to the campsite and GhasFa was missing. As was her tent, she packed up and left with MY shit.

&gt; My buddy pipes up and says “HEY! Where the hell did my food go?” Everyone scrambles to their coolers to find them pretty much empty. We all had enough food for the weekend and there was a party of 10 of us. 12 if you count GhasFa

As the girls offered to go off and do a bit of grocery shopping

To tie up this story, but we managed to make it an alright rest of the weekend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry that I have been unable to update with more stories as of late, I'm never going to the beach with Porkplanet ever again, since that is what got me into the mess to begin with. 

So now I bare the (physical) scars from the surgery as well as the emotional and will forever have a reminder of Porkplanets infliction upon me for the rest of my life.... I can't say this has done well to bond our already failing friendship further... She has been a pain for a while now, I can handle it, perhaps this whole thing has been the shock I needed to realize she's a risk to be around and friends with. 

Here is a little story of when PorkPlanet visited me in the hospital Monday evening


&gt; 8pm Monday evening.

&gt; Be in hospital. Two hours out of surgery. 

&gt; Feeling awful. 

&gt; Parents couldn't make it in time (2 hours away) because Cuteguy couldn't get a hold of them till late in the afternoon. So they promise to come take me home in the morning instead. 

&gt; iwantmymummy.gif 

&gt; Whatever

&gt; Suddenly

&gt; Lights flickering. Power cuts out. 

&gt; Generators fail. Patients die. 

&gt; JK Porkplanet is just visiting you guys!!!

&gt; Porkplanet dramatically whips the curtain back 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""OH ME GERDDDD IMGONNAMAKEIT ARE YOU OHKAY?""

&gt; Me: ""Yes I'm alright I'm just knackered"".

&gt; AS

&gt; KK: ""We brought you the Chicken Pasta in the fridge you wanted from home"". 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I WANTED TO GET YOU A DOMINO PIZZAAAAA THEY HAVE A HOT DOG STUFFED CRUST NOW!!111""

&gt; AS: ""Shut the fuck up

&gt; Me: ""She's right PorkPlanet

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH"".

&gt; Me: ""I get my strength from eating good food

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU LOOK TERRIBLE"".

&gt; AS: ""SHE LOOKS TERRIBLE BECAUSE SHE JUST HAD SURGERY UNDER GENERAL ANESTHETIC A FEW HOURS AGO. SHE'S TIRED CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP"".

&gt; Cuteguy


Sidenote: I have gained 3lb since I broke my hand. Considering I have lost 80lb+, because we're all housemates and have to, but since the Outfit saga (see Chapter One) at the start of the year, AS has nothing but disdain for PorkPlanet. Cuteguy and Porkplanet are at war with one another at the moment, too, basically because Porkplanet is hugely jealous of our relationship and thinks he's ""taking me away"" from him. According to her, we were ""the best of friends"" before he came along

&gt; Two minutes later. Porkplanet sits on edge of my bed. She obviously can't stand and hold her weight up any longer

&gt; Edge of bed visibly bows to about half a foot lower than it was a second previous. 

&gt; AS cringing. Other housemates cringing. I decide to leave it. The thing didn't break straight away after all. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME THIS MORNING I WOULD OF COME WITH YOU.""

&gt; KK: ""Stop being so loud. There are patients sleeping all around us""

&gt; Me: ""Cuteguy was there

&gt; Porkplanet (visibly flustered): ""You needed someone close with you"". 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""The hospital only let family or partners to stay. Plus

&gt; Porkplanets can't even hide her jealousy. 

&gt; AS: ""Why do you even care so much Porkplanet""

&gt; Porkplanet: ""I'm her BEST friend. We're basically family"". 

&gt; WHAT

Suddenly

&gt; Nurse: ""You there

&gt; Porkplanet acts like she didn't hear her. 

&gt; AS: ""She's talking to you Porkplanet"". 

&gt; Nurse: ""There is a weight limit of up to 150kg per bed. One patient only. Plus it's infection control""

&gt; Porkplanets is visibly flusted

&gt; Porkplanet: ""There are no chairs left anywhere"". 

&gt; Nurse: ""Then stand. But GET.OFF.THE.BED"".

&gt; Patient in next bed still laughing out loud to herself. 

She got off the bed

&gt; Porkplanet: ""IM GOIN TAKE CURR OF YOU WHEN YOUR HOME. I HAVE THE WEEK OFF!!!""

&gt; Cuteguy: ""imgonnamakeit is going home though to her parents

&gt;  Porkplanet: ""BRILL IDEA. I'LL COME WITH  YOU. THAT WAY I CAN LOOK OUT FOR YOU""

&gt; Porkplanet thinks since she spent the weekend with us and everyone else over the bank holiday weekend a few weekends ago at my parents house

&gt; Me: ""Actually

&gt; Porkplanet goes red in the face. Her jimmies are rustled.

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHY IS **HE** GOING HOME WITH YOU?""

&gt; AS: ""Uh

&gt; Nurse appears again from behind curtain. 

&gt; Nurse: ""Can **YOU** keep quiet please. There are 24 patients on this ward and a lot of them elderly and sleeping already"". She directs this at Porkplanet. 

&gt; Porkplanet just goes ""ugh"" not even a sorry

&gt; Nurse looking increasingly pissed off. Leaves curtain open this time and goes back to drug trolly. 

&gt; Cuteguy: ""We're going to have a lovely week. Once she's feeling better, fleshy wounds.

&gt; AS: ""Awh take lots of pictures you guys!!!"" she's also joining in the rubbing salt game

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WELL CAN'T I COME?""

&gt; Me: ""Well

&gt; Porkplanet: ""FINE IM GONNA BE SO BORED ALL WEEK I CAN'T BELIEEVE CUTEGUY TAKES PRIORITY

&gt; I'm too tired and barely keeping my eyes open to even argue that.

Suddenly

&gt; Nurse: ""You have one more warning about being loud. And then I'm going to ask you to leave.""

&gt; AS: ""Seriously Porkplanet. You're so fucking embarrassing. You caused all this to begin with too."" 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS"".

&gt; AS: ""Meaning you broke her hand at the beach and now it's lead to surgery. You know what I mean"". 

Porkplanet squared up to AS at this point, AS and everyone were talking in hush tones and Porkplanet was being loud. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""YOU'RE BEING A FUCKING BITCH AND RUINING THE VISIT

&gt; Cuteguy: ""No YOU are being the bitch

&gt; Nurse: ""Right that's it. YOU are leaving"" directed at Porkplanet. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""NOT FAIRRRRRRR"" she storms out, KK and other housemates leave soon after. Cuteguy stayed another hour. I was so upset and apologized to staff profusely all night. 

So there we have it. When the girls got home

Hope jimmies have been rustled and you enjoyed!

Alright, her family, and me out to dinner. Note that Barfield was not on that list. Terrific. We were going to a nice Chinese restaurant that we had been looking forward to trying. So, we all get dressed up and head out the door to meet Skinny’s family.

&gt; casually walking down the stairs

&gt; thud

&gt; thump thump

&gt; wobble wobble crash!!!

&gt; “Guys!”

&gt; we’re confused; we’re looking around for the source of this racket

&gt; then she comes lumbering down the stairs

&gt; “Guys! You started to leave without me!”

&gt; yes. and we will continue to leave without you

&gt; “Ummm

&gt; Skinny is trying to be diplomatic.

&gt; Cranky is looking apoplectic; this meal is on his dime.

&gt; “Of course I’m coming! It’s a roommate dinner!”

&gt; “Well no

&gt; please get the hint

&gt; you are not welcome here

&gt; “Well we all live together

&gt; no

&gt; we are not

&gt; Cranky can’t handle this

&gt; “You’re not invited.”

&gt; he announces this flat out

&gt; “Hahaha

&gt; seriously? we don’t even know what to do

&gt; “Barfield

&gt; apparently I was still hoping that tact would get through to her

&gt; “Well…”

&gt; we walk toward the car 

&gt; she follows

&gt; then she stops at the curb

&gt; “Why don’t you guys just swing around and pick me up?”

&gt; “Nope.”

&gt; the three of us

&gt; so she follows us to the car

&gt; “What the hell guys? You know my knee is hurt.”

&gt; we didn’t know

&gt; and we don’t care

&gt; and if we get to the car without you

Nothing spurred Barfield like the thought of a meal, and got to the car. I think she could sense that we were trying to leave her behind. No one knew how to put her off. 

&gt; “Seriously

&gt; Cranky

&gt; “You’re so funny! I can’t wait to go to this restaurant!”

&gt; “Which restaurant are we going to again?”

&gt; I asked because I had the feeling she didn’t know

&gt; and she didn’t

&gt; “Stop asking stupid questions heeheehee”

&gt; and she gets in the car

&gt; “Get out of the car.”

&gt; Cranky appears to be evaluating his odds of physically forcing her out of the car

&gt; they weren’t good

&gt; “Come on

This girl didn’t even know where we were going. She did know that none of us liked her and that none of us had spoken to her all year. Apparently she was planning on pretending the past six months or so hadn’t happened at all. The rest of us were not so keen; Cranky tried to tell her not to come. He tried to tell her she wasn’t welcome. She wouldn’t listen. So off we went. 

&gt; roll into the restaurant

&gt; swanky new Chinese joint

&gt; never feed a hambeast Chinese food 

&gt; Skinny’s parents know the saga and are obviously surprised to see Barfield

&gt; she acts like nothing is wrong and hugs them

&gt; visible disgust

&gt; cringe in sympathy; her odor is truly stunning 

&gt; everyone sits and orders

&gt; Skinny, and I order two apps and three entrees 

&gt; “Well

&gt; two of the dishes we ordered were vegetarian

&gt; all were family-style

&gt; we point this out

&gt; “Yeah

&gt; please

&gt;we're stunned and confused

&gt; this is what she was hoping for 

&gt; she turns to the waiter and orders three more entrees

&gt; let me repeat that

&gt; three. more. family. style. entrees. 

Now as I mentioned, had to witness Barfield in action. It was sort of majestic, really, like the first transcontinental railroad or the migration of a blue whale. So vast and unstoppable, you just couldn’t quite fathom it. We finished most of our food and waited while she continued to eat. And eat. And order four or five virgin tropical drinks (we were not yet of age). And eat some more. She wasn’t fast, but she was thorough. And Skinny’s parents got to witness the carnage firsthand. 

&gt; “It’s getting a little late

&gt; Skinny’s mom likes to go to bed early

&gt; “Oh

&gt; this meal was to thank them

&gt; and you want them to just leave so you can finish your gluttonous feast?

&gt; they’re too polite for that

&gt; she finishes everything

&gt; the bill comes

&gt; Cranky takes it 

&gt; looks at it for a minute

&gt; I can tell he’s not a happy camper 

&gt; he pays

&gt; say our goodbyes

&gt; go inside

&gt; “Alright

&gt; Cranky’s pissed.

&gt; “What?!?! If I had known you were going to try to make me pay for myself

&gt; “I tried to tell you to stay. I told you that you weren’t welcome. You insisted on coming.” 

&gt; “Well there’s no way it cost you $200. That’s just ridiculous.” 

&gt; out comes the receipt

&gt; he’s right

&gt; she just ate and drank $200

&gt; her meal alone cost more than feeding the other five of us

&gt; “Well I’m not paying that. You told me I wouldn’t have to pay.”

&gt; “I never said that. I never said anything like that. I just said you weren’t invited. I told you to get the fuck out of the car. This wasn’t for you and I can’t afford to feed you.  I don’t know how *you* afford to feed you.”

&gt; Cranky’s looking at us for backup

&gt; “Barfield

&gt; Cranky’s right and Barfield’s a bitch. 

A word on Cranky and Barfield: he had long ago decided she was subhuman. He simply referred to her as “the whale” or “lardbucket.” He had no qualms about demonstrating his disgust for her both to her face and in public. 

&gt; “Fuck you guys. I don’t have to take this and I don’t have to pay for that.”

&gt; she thunders into her own room

&gt; he and I look at each other

&gt; but then she comes back

&gt; without clothes

&gt; “Holy shit where the fuck are your clothes are you fucking crazy?!?!”

&gt; Cranky’s eyes are bleeding

&gt; from the look of things

&gt; take a second look

&gt; at least

&gt; “What? I’m just going to take a shower?”

&gt; nope

&gt; Cranky’s done

&gt; I start laughing; I can see him go red in the face and I can’t even look at her and I know he’s about to blow

&gt; “You think it’s fucking cute to roll out like that? Nobody wants to see that! What the fuck are you thinking?”

&gt; she just looks sort of smug 

&gt; “You fat bitch…”

&gt; he starts

&gt; and she reaches out and slaps him in the face

&gt; “Don’t you *ever* call me fat!”

&gt; oh shit

&gt; it’s on now

&gt; Cranky doesn’t even pause to rub the gigantic red welt that’s coming up on his face

&gt; he steps right up and slaps her back. hard. 

&gt; shock

&gt; jaw gaping open

&gt; “I’m going to say this one time

&gt; Skinny has fled for cover

&gt; watching

&gt; “You. Fat. Bitch.”

&gt; careful enunciation

&gt; “You moved into our house and you made a fucking mess out of everything. You live like a fucking animal and I am embarrassed to know you. I’m embarrassed *for* you. The sight of you makes me sick

&gt; oh shit

&gt; I can’t help it

&gt; I laugh

&gt; I laugh hard

&gt; “What the fuck is so funny

&gt; tears streaming down my face

&gt; “You’re a vegetarian!”

&gt; collapse into uncontrollable laughter

&gt; Barfield is dumbfounded

&gt; she turns around and goes back to her room

&gt; door slams

&gt; a check for $200 slips out from under her door

&gt; Cranky goes out and cashes it right that second

&gt; the next morning

&gt; Barfield’s door stays closed

Since this incident

Epilogue

When Barfield moved out

&gt; Barfield’s room…

&gt; didn’t she move out already?

&gt; what is all this…

&gt; good god

&gt; it’s trash

&gt; a mountain of trash

&gt; and she left it here as one final jab

&gt; pizza boxes

&gt; boxes from frozen food

&gt; holy shit there’s a microwave in here; have no idea when that happened

&gt; use brooms to clear this trash into bags; it takes five or six to hold everything

&gt; floor is covered in filth

&gt; spilled sauce

&gt; spilled soda

&gt; crumbs

&gt; pure grease

&gt; smell is almost worse with the covering layer of trash gone

&gt; and is that…?

&gt; oh hell no

&gt; that’s a mouse

&gt; and it’s not even afraid of us

&gt; and it’s a hamplanet of a mouse

&gt; you’ve got to be kidding me

That’s right, pine sol, and everything else we could think of to get that scum off of the floor. There was even filth splashed on the walls where her bed had been, presumably from eating lying down in bed. She left assorted bits and pieces of furniture, all covered in muck; we tossed them immediately. It took weeks and an appalling number of mousetraps, but we finally had our apartment back. Except for the couch, of course. The couch suffered the most of all of us and there was just no recovering from that kind of abuse. 

TL;DR: Barfield and Cranky have a battle royale.

I was in the middle of cleaning up after the entire soccer team that I was apparently responsible for babysitting when the door opened and the store got dark. VERY DARK. I thought a random storm might have dropped on our city

What was eclipsing the sun was an older woman about 50 years old and about 350-375 lbs. She was wearing short shorts so the entire populous of our metropolis could see her legs that could only be described as a mixture of cottage cheese [large curd mind you] and Berber carpet. My coworker was trapped behind the counter and gave me the ""You've got this boss"" look. I timidly approached the beast

Then it hit me. It hit me like a bus. The stench. I quickly did the ole ""well there you are, short shorts hiked up to nearly the point of me seeing how many lips she had. 

It was about this time that I started trying to figure out a way to sneak out of the store to take my lunch. Giant rush of people. Temporarily forget about the giant floor ornament. Then it happened.

The smell.

It cometh.

The beast approached the counter with about 7 Sims 3 games in her sausage like hands. How she got back up off the floor without a construction crew and a crane was beyond me. Grabbed the game cases and started trying to get the transaction with as quickly as possible. I heard a yordle. The creature was attempting to communicate in its native tongue. 

I look back. There is a massive green/yellow trail of snot going from her nose to her upper lip. This wasn't your average booger. This was a slug paving a path from one orifice to another. Begin scanning the games

Insert dry-heave here

Starts trying to have a conversation with my coworker asking if he wants to be in her Sims game. She gives him a wink and goes to lick her lips. The wild snorlax's snot trail gets caught by her tongue. It starts getting sucked up into her gaping hole of a face. She realizes that something is on her tongue

The Planet Terror starts to leave, she decides to shout/grunt out ""I wrote my number down for you, if you get lonely and want a REAL woman. My boyfriend doesn't have to know"" to my coworker.  

Neither of us said a word to each other for the next hour...

Finally had to break the silence.

&gt;  She's going to cry with joy when she sees  I have lost yet more weight.

&gt; Suddenly the walls are tilting

&gt; Porkplanet is running down the stairs. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Omg MotherMadeIt!!!"" 

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""Porkplanet how lovely to see you!!""

&gt;  They embrace. 

&gt;  [MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmnvifuquE1qfxo5oo1_500.gif) I realize nobody embraces PorkPlanet anymore except for my foster mother. Not even her own mother hugs her when she comes to visit. Make mental note to hug PorkPlanet more since I'm not a horrible human being and being hugged is nice.

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""SHUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE""

MotherMadeIt is too nice. It's gonna be a long

&gt; Be in the shopping centre about an hour later. 

&gt; Me and MotherMadeIt decide to enter one shop that does regular and plus sized clothes. I'm still plus sized. But not for long if I have my own way.
 
&gt; Porkplanet: ""Ughhh! But they never do MY plus size here!""

&gt; Me (I snap): ""We're here to buy clothes for ME PorkPlanet!"" 

&gt; [HFW](http://www.katesullivanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tumblr-gif-shocked-i7.gif)

20 minutes later. I am in the dressing room trying on several pairs of jeans, but this store is pretty cheap anyway. Plus student discount!

&gt; PorkPlanet out on the shop floor looking for clothes in my size.
 
&gt; She brings back two pairs of jeans that are three sizes too big for me now. 

&gt; Me: ""Porkplanet

&gt; PorkPlanet (acting dumb): ""What do you mean?""

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""She's three sizes smaller than that now
 
&gt; PorkPlanet (still acting dumb): ""Oh

Side note; Porkplanet and I used to be twinnie hamplanets before I lost a tonne of weight

&gt; Me: ""Can you go and get one of the pairs you have in my actual size please?"" 

&gt; PorkPlanet huffs and obliges
minutes later with jeans in an actual size that fit me. Her jimmies look rustled. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Let me know if you need a bigger size"" and a cheesy grin. 

&gt; [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8grlb0z151qbelaf.gif) these jeans must fit even if I have to stay behind this curtain and starve myself for 10 days until they fit just to prove a point to this bitch. Praying in the dressing room.

&gt; Slide them up my legs. Moment of truth. 

&gt; THEY FIT. GOD LISTENED!

&gt; Suddenly

&gt; I'm gonna show this blatent bitch who's boss. 

&gt; Start putting on a  tshirt and jacket I've also picked out in my new and improved clothes size! Feeling fabulous

&gt; Can hear PorkPlanet bumping her gums down the end of the dressing room to my mother.

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""She just.... is at the gym all the time you know? It's unhealthy. Plus

&gt; MotherMadeIt: ""What do you mean she doesn't eat enough?"" (My mother knows I don't starve myself

&gt; PorkPlanet: ""Well last night we were all eating Pizza enjoying ourselves and her and AS (housemate) walk into the living room with chicken and some couscous stuff and it just didn't look enough and I'm worried for her if I'm honest"". 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/head_shake.gif) it didn't look enough for PorkPlanet because her stomach is the size of a rugby ball and mine has shrunk back down to it's normal size.

So having read the stories of the girl who's boyfriend got savaged by a hamplanet

So I was 15, I had to work mine out in pounds for you muricans). Anyway, there was a serious hamplanet who sat next to me in one or two of my classes, and she had a painful, painful crush on me. She looked as if the King of the Polar bears had broken a dog's face, pumped the blubber of a seal he'd recently clubbed to death into it and then injected it with smallpox to give it a suitably cratered appearence, and then put it on a human body. The body, was like a white rhino's without the grace or thick skin- she combined being stocky and being a corpulent human ball of grease in one. She was about 5' 6 and I'd say at least 220 pounds. She was also oddly confident, press ups and jogging etc. She couldn't do a single pull up, as I actually gave her the time of day on occasions. I'm a polite guy

Anyway

Anyway, but this was just a tragedy against mankind. Short shorts that strained against her leg blubber, which sagged slightly due to gravity, her club-like feet squeezed into dainty dolly shoes which had already burst a few seams, a top that was far too small and showed far too much, her belly strained against the thin material. She was approaching- well waddling really- rapidly, and I tried to ignore her
'Heeeey LordCreamCheese
I pretended not to hear.
'LordCreamCheese

Will be continued, it's quite the saga!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

PART II!

So we're in the middle of town in front of ~200 people, snorting like a wildebetusbeast chomping down on McFood for her thyroid 'n' sugars. 

'Who's this then?' she roars in a faux-jovial manner, just need to talk your *boyfriend* ' she manages to sneer between her thick fatty lips, before planting another bite of a McDonalds burger into her maw. My girlfriend basically shrinks and dies, as any sensible person would when approached with this nightmarish sight. Lardjungle, being her obnoxious self, takes this as a yes and pulls me by my HAND- my delicate, innocent hand clasped between her clammy, but she can't even move having been confronted by such a beast. 

I soon manage to pull my hand free

'Look

She flips

'You ignorant, but look at her stick insect arms- wouldn't you rather have someone like me?' (To be honest, I can't quite remember this conversation, but this is the brunt of what she said). She actually *twirled* and winked at me, incidentally showing the sweat patches that have developed on the tight linen of her shirt. I really haven't been able to describe how unattractive this woman is, even if she wasn't the size of a small car she wouldn't be pretty. 

'I'll win you over

I return to my girlfriend

Next the internet stalking stage...

______________________________________________________________________________________________

PART III (the dangers of the internet)

So I go home that evening to find myself the recipient of not one, but FIFTEEN messages from the Queen of Lard. Starting, gratifyingly, with a cringeworthy apology and descending into angry messages asking why I 'betrayed' her, attachments of her dressed in cosplay costumes that are meant for skinny girls (Misty doesn't suit bulges...it was worse than [THIS](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fat+misty+cosplay&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45175338,d.d2k&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=YC5oUbamA4XS0QXF8YHgBA#imgrc=6BWqGz2ZaMYWUM%3A%3BIm0XFwWF0VTgqM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fimg3.joyreactor.com%252Fpics%252Fpost%252Fgeek-cosplay-anime-erotic-355333.jpeg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fjoyreactor.com%252Ftag%252Fmisty%3B735%3B980)) and eventually turning into her making up rumours about my girlfriend and even starting to be racist. She had liked all my facebook pictures and written on my wall a couple of times too. The last message offered me some naked pictures to 'persuade you that my curves are better than her twigs ;)'. This is when, it stopped being funny and got really


After this, but our entire school had the password thanks^to^me )and how she wanted to 'eat me up' like a McDonalds. One time I tweeted saying I was going to the cinema with my girlfriend, and half way through, through the darkness a hand protruded offering me some popcorn and it was LardJesus herself, taking up two seats and shoving two handfuls of toffee coated popcorn from an XXL bag into her remorseless gob. She then spent the rest of the film putting her head in between our heads whenever we got close to give me her stupid, asinine thoughts on how the plot was advancing and once just to whisper 'I miss you', spurting crumbs of popcorn into my ear canal. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

PART 4 (le party- a cautionary tale; whales shouldn't drink)

So this girl has been stalking me and trying to ruin my relationship for a solid 3 or 4 months by now

So myself and my girlfriend arrive at the party, it all went to complete shit as soon as the beast squeezed her way through the door. She'd been gaining weight steadily through her obsession with me, and I'd say she'd definitely gained a stone or two in the 3 or 4 months, and resembled a constipated seal even more now. Once again, she had gone down the 'slutty' clothes road, with a skimpy black dress that made her look like a pork leg that hadn't had it's string taken off yet, and her belly was genuinely overhanging. Her make up looked like it had been applied by a seven year old

'LordCreamCheese,d.d2k&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=uDNoUZ2yE8mN0wX8o4DwBg#imgrc=ZtD4HZfBcyp7JM%3A%3BsNt81MXEkuGaKM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fphraseturner.files.wordpress.com%252F2011%252F04%252Frachels-wtf-face.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fphraseturner.wordpress.com%252F2011%252F04%252F05%252Fgleewind-2-03-grilled-cheesus%252F%3B816%3B768) as she waddled her way into the dancefloor, throwing an empty wine bottle and her purse on the floor as she quaked through the hallway and into the party. It was deadly quiet except from the WEEPING of my girlfriend- yes she was so sick of the stalking that it actually made her cry.
Next part coming soon- bitch smackdowns!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Part 5- proof whales shouldn't drink.

The fudgehoarder is well and truly plastered, leaving me on my own to deal with this flabby equivalent of relationship nuclear waste. 

A brief summary of the conversation- if you couldn't tell

&gt;What the FUCKING FUCK are you doing here

&gt;Honey

&gt;NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE WITH YOUR FLABBERY, CLEAR ALCOHOLISM, LONELINESS AND FUCKING CUNTERY. YOU'VE MADE MY GIRLFRIEND CRY

&gt;That bitch? *hic* *giggles* What a joke

She grabs my hand again and tries to pull me upstairs

Coming up- the final resolution with extra POLICE INTERVENTION :D

______________________________________________________________________________________________

The FINALE (or why whales who don't think they're whales need to sit the fuck down)

So, her sausagey fingers running their way up and down my jumper, probably leaving snail trails of grease and forlorn flab that are irremovable on it. And then, after all of this shit, she puts her arms around my neck, the rolls pushing against my delicate neck flesh, and tries to pull me in for a kiss after snidely remarking 'I've got you just where I want you'. I recoil from the flabby, the stench of pizza and cheap wine, we had tried to be very accomodating but this was just the end. The house walrus starts bawling her eyes out, with many expletives

So we've completely drama-stomped this guys party, the thought of LordCreamCheese and food are the only thing that get me through...I'd have killed myself otherwise'. The police takes statements from everyone at the party, and take her away. 

That is pretty much the end of the story, I'll tie all the knots together then. Frankly there's a whole lot of other crazy that she did, a lot of that is entertainingly also to do with her body, so I might add some other stuff later. Bitches be crazy. But after that, I was no longer staked by a fat psycho.

&gt; The fat logic is strong in me

&gt;  Also find out he's been sexting a yoga instructor he met at the gym

&gt; ouch.rage and part of me was ishouldntbesosurprised.jpeg 

&gt; Dump him on Halloween 

&gt; thatwasverybrave.exe

&gt;  I'm gonna lose weight


Side note, but going to the gym. I don't know if any of you recovering Hamplanets are former smokers, but I am (I still occasionally smoke when I drink) but being overweight and smoking is deadly, and makes for an even worse recovery when you finally decide to change your lifestyle. All through November and December when I finally started hitting the gym, every session was TOUGH. I was out of breath within minutes and it was only till Christmas I started getting into the swing of things. The weight is flowing off my now like melted cheese. 

So here is the real story. 

&gt; Be living at University with course mates (and friends) 

&gt; There are six of us. Three I'll only introduce because they are significant. The first two are KK (5""2, 130lb, healthy food nerd)

&gt; Then there is Porkplanet. 5""8 and about 300lb. Was once my best friend in the house at one point, just not some of her bitchy qualities. Have tried over and over to move her away from supernova status, but the fat logic is strong in this one. She dates online and has a fetish for pulling bony nerdy betas. Thinks she's gods gift to men. 

&gt; It is Christmas. We say our goodbyes. We are off school for a month. Promise AS and KK that I will continue gym and dieting over Christmas with brother

&gt; Before we left for Christmas

&gt; Whatever bitch

&gt; Lose 3kg over the Christmas period (6lb) - success! And I managed not to miss out on all the lovely food (in moderation). Since I started working out and dieting early November

&gt; Coming back from home to University

&gt; Feeling good

&gt; everythingisgoingbetterthaniexpected.png

&gt; Arrive back at my house. AS

&gt; Feeling self conscious because they are showering me with compliments

&gt; Not used to this

&gt; Oddly excited to see Porkplanet, and not on the couch with her eating food. Usually a break does us all good. 

&gt; Door shuts. 

&gt; Omg it's Porkplanet! We've missed her so much. 

&gt; And suddenly

&gt; Tiles are falling off the roof of our house and falling to the ground outside our living room window. 

&gt; Floor boards in hallway are screaming in agony instead of creaking. 

&gt; Porkplanet bursts into living room. About 20lb bigger than before she left in December. Everyone rejoices anyway.

&gt; She goes straight for KK and AS with hugs

&gt; AS: ""Porkplanet

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Yeah real cool. I'm starving I'm gonna make food"". 

&gt; Okay whatever

&gt; 11.30pm that night

&gt; Shows me whatsapp messages her and Porkplanet have been sending back and forth to one another for the last hour from both of their bedrooms. 

&gt; I scroll. One message says ""It looks like imgonnamakeit hasn't really lost any weight over Christmas

&gt; youfuckingbitchwhyareyoubeinlikethis.rage

&gt; Quietly ignore her for the rest of the week. Easy to do since we spent 8 hours a day in the library completing essays and revising for exams. The rest of the time we are at the gym or pool while porkplanet is at home baking brownies and eating pizza every night.

&gt; Be Friday the following week. We're in the library trying to finish our essay. 

&gt; Porkplanet: ""Screw this let's go shopping and go out tonight clubbing"". 

&gt; We're all on board. We finished our exams and we can finish this essay on Sunday and Monday

What I didn't expect next was actually the perfect day. We all went out shopping, and still being plus size bought a skater dress (in red), some new shoes and a leather jacket to wear out. The only difference this time shopping for plus size clothes was that I was two sizes smaller! I'm feeling good, looking good. Myself, KK, AS and other housemate leave the mall early as we are all going to go swimming for an hour before we get ready and go out tonight. Porkplanet, and other housemate remain at the mall. We didn't see them again until that night and oh boy. 

&gt;  Be 8pm. Finally home from swimming. Get hair done, feeling sexy. 9pm. Land-speed record for getting ready for a girl. But I want to party 'cause I'm feeling good and happy and free for once in my entire sorry existence. 

&gt; Approaching Kitchen. Can hear lots of voices. We told Porkplanet to text around and invite our friends. Guess a few people came. 

&gt; Enter kitchen. Cheers. Yay my friends are here! Everyone is like ""oh my god you look amazing"" feeling incredibly shy and nervous but at the same time fuckit.jpeg 'cause I feel good tonight even if I still am a mini-moon. 

&gt; Giving kisses and hugs. Catching up with people properly. 

&gt; Turn a corner in our kitchen and see my ex boyfrend. Not sure why he is here but he's with his friend who is a mutual friend of ours

Alright my sugar coated friends, low blood sugar. Okay, when we left off slowbro was being super beta, and jigglybitch tried to suck Ash, my boyfriend into her rolls. That was the jist of nearly every encounter, until this one. 

Alright, who was supposed to be making payments. Fast forward, it had been 5 or 6 months, and they had yet to make a payment.  We found out they has also not changed the registration on the car, and had even wrecked it. Ash was pissed. Ash had been trying to be nice, and give them the benefit of the doubt, until he saw the damage.

&gt;Driving around town

&gt;Ash sees a Honda that looks suspiciously like his.. 

&gt;Oh look

&gt;HFW [he sees this] (http://imgur.com/QuM6qda)

&gt; “Call your brother.”

&gt; I use Ashes phone

&gt; Not Ash. Her tone changes.

&gt; “WHAT DO YOU WANT.”

&gt; “Where are you guys? Ash wants to talk to you about the car” I ask

&gt; pause… “WE'RE UH

&gt; “Oh, what did you need at Walmart?”

&gt; “OH WE'RE JUST PICKING UP SOME GROCERIES.. OH FUCK.” (hangs up)

&gt; I call back

&gt; “He asked me to call you. He wants to talk about the car.”

&gt; “Well

&gt; Whatever. I went in with him

&gt; Enter walmart

&gt; That bastard. I knew he had bolted. 

&gt; Cars gone. 

&gt; Oh well

&gt; We were nearly to their trailer when we saw them leaving
follow. 

&gt; Jigglybitch calls Ash

&gt; “teehee ASH
NEED THE CAR! 

&gt; Not Ash

For the record

&gt; “Okay

&gt; Silence. (Hangs up.)

&gt; Suddenly Ash’s phone starts blowing up with text messages. First pleading with him
he didn’t answer fast enough comments on his sexuality. 

&gt; Ash is getting pissed. 

&gt; We’re still following them. 

&gt; They pull up into this little trailer compound in the middle of nowhere. 
Have I mentioned that we live in the county they based “Deliverance” out of? Not even kidding.

&gt;doyouhearbanjos.jpeg

&gt;Slowbro gets out of the car

&gt;Jigglybitch bursts out of the car with speed I have never seen her reach. One arm full of fatcakes
into her mouth. 

&gt;She approaches the most run down trailer and starts hollering for her paw paw. 

&gt; Ash is hesitant to get out of the car. 

&gt; dontbeapussy.gif

&gt; Paw paw comes out

&gt; Jigglybitch starts this big drawn out story about how we’re stealing her car

&gt; Moves with such emphasis that the cellulite in her cankles is jiggling with her. 

&gt; I push Ash to get out of the car

&gt;Paw paw goes over to investigate. 

&gt;Jigglybitch, which is quite a feat.. she could be a skilled ventriloquist. 

&gt; I’m a slut, and fat.. whatever.

&gt; Then she brought up something so low

&gt; YOU ONLY STAY WITH ASH BECAUSE HE’S THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL TAKE YOU AFTER doesntevendeserveanickname USED YOU 
UP. 

Just over a year prior, apparently. 

&gt;That’s it

&gt; Jigglybitch
unsuspecting guys

&gt;Jigglybitch calls for paw paw with a smug look on her face. Once again makes some comment about doesntevendeserveanickname.

&gt; I’m out of the car

&gt; I quickly estimate that I have at least 10 minutes; the trailer has 3 or 4 stairs. 

&gt; She takes that as me backing down and starts laughing. 

&gt; I punch her directly in the face. She stumbles backwards and lands on her giant ass. 

&gt; ohshit.thatfeltgood. 

&gt; She starts crying for her paw paw, and I only hated her because she was bigger than me. 

&gt; She flops around a bit

&gt; I punch her again

&gt; I hear Ash yell my name

&gt; oh shit

&gt; I sprint back to the car

&gt; Ash – “I can’t believe you finally hit her.”

&gt; Feelsgoodbro.jpeg

In a moment of clarity, and still had his plates on it. I figured it wouldn’t be long until Jigglybitch realized I assaulted her, and that she would call the cops too. What she didn’t realize was that I was friends with nearly every cop in the town. I worked for two restaurants, and gave them free food all the time. Most of them were hamplanets themselves, and the quickest way to their hearts was with free greasy beetus inducing burgers. 

Both Slowbro and Jigglybitch were arrested. Slowbros charges were dropped


The end.

P.S. No, mixed with a few assumptions, once Jigglybitch was sentenced Slowbro went off to find someone else to mooch off of. I don't know anything else about what happened to Jigglybitch. It's a few years later now, and my brother is engaged, and still unemployed. ",SERIES,False,t5_2vzax,True

...so I'm taking the liberty of copy pastaing because you all have  conditions and need more stories:

Baked goods. Everyone loves baked goods. My sister

We venture out the front door and hop into his Jeep and set on down the road to the local grocer. We arrive and as we are looking to park this women, head directly to the baked goods counter, and wait in line to be served. The Blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her. 

Our turn to be served comes up, as there was a line, and we told her we would be back to pick up our order. As we were walking away The Blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one. She begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line. However, the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake. At this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the Blob stole our parking spot, and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake. However, our dealing with the Blob were far from over.

We headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets, and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved. We headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter. We ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up. She then points down the bread aisle to the Blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart. Now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake, but we were not backing down.


We followed her for some time through the grocery store. We decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back. The second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over

As we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her. So we wrote up a note, we could tell she was angry as hell that we got our cake back.

She had tried her best to cope with people calling her fat before (former chubbs but took tennis to lose all that fat) so she ran outside to cry while lardzilla devoured her sandwich (it was an egg salad sandwich for those who where wondering)

This weekend I got to spend some time with my mother and my boyfriend. Yay.

We spent the day in a small Texas tourist trap town. The bf and I find a tea shop in town. Us

Bf ordered black ice tea flavored with plum and I ordered hot oolong tea with pomagranete. It was am^m^m^azing. Bf had almost finished his glass when an eldritch horror plodded into the shoppe. 

My best guess. F/5'6""/350ish. Soaked with sweat and had a bottle of beetus in hand. 

Luck wasn't on our side as she was seated next to us. 

We are both fairly attractive bisexual men but the sight and smell of this woman almost made us renounce women altogether. She proceeded to move her mouthflaps in our general direction. 

""What yalll two guud luukin men doin hur without any guuurls?""

Both of us ignored her and focused on our tea. 

She ordered a basic bland green hot tea. Once it arrived she took one sip and spit it out over her table. ""Dis disgustin, if you are ao inclined, they bring honey. 

But alas FPS

Then she ordered to see the manager. She demanded that her three dollar tea be comp'ed because it was disgusting. The older gentleman was having none of this shit and told her no.

At this point I couldn't watch anymore because I could hear that poor tea begging for death. So I grabbed bf's hand and we made for the door. But teawhale saw us and decided to voice her displeasure with our life choice. 

""Yahll two faggets get back here. I knew yall were hellbound when I sahhh yuuuu"" 

Bf comes from a fumdamentalist home and still takes stuff like that pretty bad. And he starts crying. 

The whale pipes up again ""thats right fag

I lost my shit ""you fucking cow"" I bellowed ""considering you probably dont have long for this world

Bf stood up and I planted a firm kiss on his lips dead infront of her and walked out. Bf and I hands locked.

So I am standing outside of a warmup ring, someone yells, ""Hey! YOU!"" 

I look up to see a 5'5"", one of my apprentice trainers and students. My horse sees this mass storming towards him and gets a bit antsy. He's young and very energetic, so it doesn't take much to excite him. He's also worth $35 000 so I try to keep him pretty far away from the public.

""Are you this girl's manager?"" 

""Yes

She stops

""Just preventing an incident before it happens

""Your stupid rider called my daughter --"" she points at the girl -- ""fat! She was incredibly insulting and I want *you* to do something about it!"" 

So, so this really shocked me.

I kinda just looked at her and went ""… *really*?"" 

She looked like she was going to cry and shook her head. ""I didn't

Mama moon freaks out immediately. ""Oh yes she did! She was making fun of my daughter and her riding and then she mocked her and called her fat! She said she'd never amount to anything and told her to give up!"" At this point the daughter is smirking at Laura

Mama moon makes to follow her, shouting, obnoxious, HUGE human, and I have to remind her *again* to keep a distance. She looks enraged that someone is telling her what to do, but listens. I ask Laura to tell me exactly what she said. She managed to make it through with the woman or the daughter interrupting every few words and me having to shush them and remind them I am trying to get both sides of the story. 

""She came over to the waiting area all upset about her ride. She asked me if I saw the ride and how stupid the horse was being (daughter yells ""it was the horse

She looks a bit sheepish and replies

I confront the mother. ""Now

""That's it? That's all you're going to do?! She should be pulled from competition! I don't want her anywhere near my daughter!"" 

""I am not going to pull her from competition for engaging in a conversation with someone."" 

""I guess I shouldn't expect any less from the bitch who runs a farm that's so stuck up you hire people based on *looks*. You all ought to be ashamed."" 

""That's a bit unfair. We operate at a very high level of competition

""Oh, looks like *your* riders starve themselves to meet your stupid standards."" Note: our standards are 95lbs *heavier* than Laura's weight. She is just a tiny person, but super fit. 

I spend so much time in this sub, therefore I have to not make an ass of myself. ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" 

""I bet she can out-ride any of you. "" 

""That's nice.""

""Bitch!"" And with that

Random side note

So later that day, young horse, it's his first big competition at that height so I'm being very careful with him because he has a history of refusing when he gets too nervous (stopping dead right before a fence, often sending the rider over his head). All is going well, we're riding along the fence where the spectators are, have a 3-jump combination… 

Suddenly RIGHT before the third fence, tries to stop, I had to give him a smack with my whip just so he wouldn't stop in the middle of the combo. Which I felt bad for because this one wasn't his fault. Finished up, not too bad for his first class at that height. I was happy with it. 

Ride out of the ring to see the woman sitting there with her smirking daughter. ""STUPID BODY-SHAMING BITCH! CAN'T RIDE WORTH SHIT!"" 

… fucking people. I just ignored her and dismounted/gave the horse to my groom who suddenly pointed back to the ring and burst out laughing uncontrollably. 

Security confronted her for shouting, and the lady started shoving at the security guards. So they cuffed her and forced her off the grounds while her daughter screamed and whaled about how unfair everything was. 

I was so happy. 

The end.

For the past several months, by the way.)

Today at a small get together I was greeted by an overweight woman... Let us call her X. Although she was definitely pushing 350+ pounds, aoft, and gooey. 

Everybody gravitates towards the cookies, one cookie won't hurt me, I'm skinny enough, etc etc. She is beginning to attract the attention of other people as I continue to tell her I am all set and I don't want a cookie. I'm starting to get embarrassed from all this attention as I politely decline once again. 

My words, telling her I don't want a cookie. By now others are beginning to chime in. 

""One cookie won't hurt"" 
""C'mon kiarta
""Don't starve yourself!""
""Just have a cookie!""

I am now feeling very uncomfortable. I don't like attention and with everybody in the room berating me, hell-bent on making my life more uncomfortable, takes the cookie and tries to SHOVE IT IN MY MOUTH. 

Yep. She forcibly shoved this cookie into my face

""Did you just try and shove a cookie down my throat?!"" 

She doesn't look the least bit ashamed. 

""Well

I shit you not... These were the exact words this hambeast told me. I didn't even know how to respond for a moment; I was flabbergasted she assumed it was acceptable to stuff food in other people's faces. Even more so

""Just eat the cookie

I'm usually a pretty non confrontational person

""Do I look like I'm enjoying myself now that you have attacked me with a cookie? I was perfectly fine before everybody started berating me. How about you learn some manners and stop shoving your own fat beast ideals down other people's throats! Some of us like to exhibit a little bit of self control... Which I think you could use a little more of!""

&gt; be me, Skinny, 5’9”, 110 lbs and Cranky, 5’11”, 160 lbs. 

&gt; knock knock

&gt; open door 

&gt; holyshitjesusmaryandjosephstalinwhatisthisnightmare?!?!?!?!

&gt; it’s definitely in the 400 lb range

&gt; and over 6 ft tall

&gt; “Hey guys. I’m Chubs McNasty.”

&gt; our hearts and floorboards are breaking

&gt; this is our last chance to keep our apartment but she’s (oh yes

&gt; pokerface

&gt; never have I heard such an unhappy sound come from furniture. 

&gt; it was like the chair was dying

&gt; we’re trying to make the best of this… maybe she’s cool?

Skinny and I had made a gigantic lasagna with the intention of eating leftovers for the rest of the week. I mean, and a corresponding amount of sauce and pasta. This would easily have been dinner for the three human roommates for a week, maybe more. But alas, it was not to be. 


&gt; So

&gt; Well we made a salad and some lasagna. Help yourself!

&gt; first mistake… never let her help herself

&gt; scoops a full half of this lasagna onto her plate

&gt; this portion of lasagna is bigger than her plate

&gt; we look on in awe

The three of us took reasonable portions of lasagna and plenty of salad. Chubs never even gave the greens a second look. She just plowed through that plate. Then


&gt; This lasagna is so good

&gt; Ummmmm…. Thanks! 

&gt; as if we couldn’t tell 

&gt; since you just ate the entire fucking pan

&gt; a whole pan of lasagna

&gt; and then you wanted to know where dessert was

Lucky for Chubs, which we brought out with some pride. 

&gt; Oh

&gt; Skinny and I start cutting cake.

&gt; get three pieces down onto  plates

&gt; wait where is the cake?

&gt; it’s gone!

&gt; it was just here!

&gt; then we hear a horrible

&gt; Chubs has seated herself smack in the middle of our couch and is INHALING THE REST OF THE CAKE!!!

&gt; holyshit

&gt; that’s a whole cake

A word on our couch: it’s big. Four or five people could sit comfortably on this thing without intruding on each other’s space. We know this because we did it regularly when we had friends over. Chubs sat

&gt; awkwardly drag dining room chairs over and sit in living room

&gt; she is somehow talking through this mountain of cake while shoveling it into her gaping maw

&gt; we learn  she is planning on becoming vegetarian

&gt; I’m sure the four pounds of beef you just ate will help that. 

&gt; we had been planning on playing cards

&gt; nope

&gt; she finishes this cake and then apologizes for moving to the couch – she can’t sit in an upright chair like that 
because it hurts her back

&gt; not a word about the army’s worth of food she just consumed

&gt; we sit for ten minutes

&gt; So… do you guys have anything to snack on? 

&gt; WHAT?!?!?!?

&gt; ummm… no… 

&gt; when she determines that there is no more food to be had

&gt; we stand around looking at each other for a minute

&gt; we retreat to the couch to recover and find…

&gt; the couch is broken

&gt; it just sags right down in the middle 

&gt; it looks like a Dali clock

&gt; we sit on it and the three of us slide down to the middle

You’d think we’d shut the door with relief, right? Listen. We seriously loved this place. LOVED IT. So we did the unthinkable. After she ate an entire pan of lasagna and an entire cake and then broke our couch, we let Chubs sign on to the lease. We didn’t think it could be that bad; she had been nice enough, right?

Her: ""tee hee"" and toddles off to make some disgusting thing where she opens a can of refried beans, and calls that a snack

Stand over her and snarl. ""I fucking mean it. Wednesday. I need your help and we need to get all the cats out of here or they will DIE. I have a place to park them all for free but I need you to help me""

This morning I was on my way home from job #1 (4:30am-9:30am shift... whooo) and decided to swing by the uni and drop off a coffee for T like a good gf because he was having a bad morning. Get to the music department, but something is terribly wrong. 

In the next chair over

My evil side is a little bit happy she's there

Walk over, T gives me a desperate/haunted look and says ""you... are a life-saver."" Glances at M and back, meaningfully. 

I ask if he wants to take a lap (the uni has a long hallway that wraps around the entire floor. When I talk to people I like to ""take a lap

She's glaring daggers. ""T... can I talk to you?""

He's already out of his chair and to the doorway. ""Yeah sure

She's turning red. She's gun blow... 

We hightail it out of there, touches him when they talk, hugs him at every opportunity, dropping hint after hint about how they should date.

""You're so funny! I need a guy *exactly* like you

Apparently has also decided to give him a ""cutesy nickname."" It is, you're so cute!"" wtf. I can't make this shit up. 

We finish the lap and M is waiting expectantly. All traces of food have miraculously disappeared and she has clearly been fussing with her hair and such. I felt awful, had to get started) and announced to bf that I was taking off. She brightened noticeably and, right in front of me, asked: 

""Hey *British*

""What the hell M

...

Silence. 

I don't know if he meant for that to come out. 

She's gone red again. I'm paralyzed. I think we're about to be eaten. Tears are welling in her eyes. 

""That was the first thing I've had today --"" (it's 10:30am-ish) ""-- and I need to make sure I get enough food energy to get me through today! I don't have a break again until 5pm. Do you know what starvation mode is? If I don't get enough calories it won't go over well with my body.""

[The White Girl Wasted Playlist](http://imgur.com/a/yWaVL)

To be clear, its definitely bitch logic, and it's part of the story. 

John started dating Hannah in early September. She was about 5'10, and apparently was also trying to pursue a degree in fashion. She and John come into the bar one night during my shift. As soon as I see them, I smile and wave, and am met with the coldest stare I've ever gotten. This girl was pulling the ugliest face, it made her look like a cat in heat. As soon as John brought her over to me, she looks at him, then back at me and flashes me this big fake smile and does a high pitched ""hello"". When John introduced me as his ""best friend"", it's me, asked me out for the 300th time and Hannah laughed and said ""Just your type

I got home that night (John had went back to Hannah's place with her), and even though we were trying to use hushed voices, our living room troll hurtled out of it's couch and crash landed at the counters. Maggie wanted to know what we were saying about John. Amazing hearing for a person who doesn't seem to register I want her to toss out her own trash. We tried to ignore her, because she had tried to ""borrow a couple things"" from our closets over the past week, tearing two work blouses of mine, a club dress Sasha had just bought, and my college sweat pants (because Maggie doesn't have enough sweatpants). It was incredibly frustrating, to find the kitchen barren

""Maggie

""I've been blogging a lot though

What?. We started locking our rooms after that. Sasha almost punched Maggie in the face because she spent a lot of money on her clothes

Anyway, OKAY?""

She started crying and ran to her room. The entire night she threw books against the walls and wailed about ""CHEATING SCUM"". Sasha, so around 3 in the morning, it was decided to perform an extraction. This was a huge mistake. As soon as I walked into the room, I met about half our kitchenware. Bowls with spoiled, cereal dyed milk. Plates with giant streaks of crusty sauce and oil. Almost all of our spoons caked with nutella. I couldn't even begin to describe the smell. We pulled her out, sat her down and told her to calm the fuck down before she hurt herself. This was the attention that Maggie had been looking for, and Sasha and I  then had to sit and listen to hours of ""I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING"". We kept listening while Andrew performed the second mission that night: Operation Cutlery Freedom. No amount of logic would suffice. So I just got fed up and told her ""yeah, so maybe it won't last long."" I instantly regretted that

 1) because I really didn't know her

 2) Maggie's face lit up like a sweaty

Shit. 

Fast forward to Andrew's birthday dinner, and we decided we'd do steak, fries, apple cider and maybe a couple pies, as they're Andy's favorite. Maggie invites herself at word one, and Andy said ""whatever, just buy more steak."" We got some money from Maggie, the five of us from the house

Earlier in the day, 

""I DONT EVEN LIKE FRUIT"" 

""Then why are you inching over to the window sill every five seconds?""

We had Cherry, and Banana Cream. Maggie actually snuck up and cartoon-style stole the Banana Cream (my favorite). I found her in the backyard when I went to clean out the grill, face-first in the tin. Shoulda' decoy-pied. I grabbed the fly swatter, and swatted her on her tundra of an ass. She let out a yelp like I'd whipped her with a cat o nine tails. She proceeded to lecture me about keeping her blood sugar up, and I told her to go chug the sugar bowl, not eat the birthday pies. We had John play pie goalie after that, which was great because every time she made an approach (teeheeing) he'd start screeching ""PIE PERIMETER HAS BEEN BREACHED, and we had to cut potatoes to this lovely sound.

Hannah came over two hours early. That was okay, and lovely jewelry. She walked into the kitchen as Maggie was playing peek-a-boo with the pies, John guarding. Hannah's eye widened. John had said she REALLY didn't like fat people, logic or not. Maggie took one look at Hannah and made the exact same facial expression. The battle had begun.

Hannah tries to get a kiss from John, and says "" HI BIRTHDAY BOY"" as loud as she can. John told me to be nice to her because ""she doesn't have a lot of girl friends"". Wow. I wonder why. 

Hannah asks Sasha, before Hannah looks at her, insulted, and says "" I was just asking!"" ...Sasha gives me a look. Yeah, bitch, I was exaggerating. Maggie picks that moment to scream ""RACIST"". Hannah stalks off to the backyard, dragging John behind her. Ugh.

We're now just drinking beer in the kitchen. Andy comes into the kitchen, and he seemed, just little….pushy. This dinner was turning into a giant shitstorm. And I didn't even have Banana Cream Pie. 

Andy's bros arrive. Besides Todd, Gary, and Ross. So Todd is about 5'9 and very muscular. Biceps like mountains. As soon as he sees me, he's like glue. Keeps touching my hair, my waist. Showing off his ""physique"", lifting up his shirt to ""fan himself"". I'm getting really really uncomfortable, and just keep trying to avoid him by making excuses to be away from the backyard/kitchen. I've just surfaced from my twentieth bathroom trip, and I'm really hoping Maggie didn't try to liberate the steaks from their fiery resting place. But no. There, while Maggie body slams into her. I run over and tackle Maggie

""WHAT YOU BITCH??! FIRST MY MAN

""Want the pie, before Maggie exhausts my strength. Too late. One hammy foot is making a break for the pie, catches it as Hannah is at a downswing. Artificial cherry filling goes flying onto Hannah's beautiful, white as paper dress. Maggie can not (obviously) keep her fat foot so high in the air, so she does the only logical thing: fall backwards onto the soft, pillowy mattress that is my body. 

I don't really remember too much of this. It happened so fast. I managed to push myself back, pie filling rolling off her dress. Carrie, the dessert years. The guys enter, and for a split second, I'm sure they all thought Maggie had shot Hannah, with the way they were both blubbering. I was just registering the sheer pain in my back and head, and let out a groan as I felt a nice big lump forming on my head. John and (oh joy) Todd ran to see if I was bleeding; they thought I had fallen onto the countertop and hit my head. The rest of the guys tried to hoist up Maggie. It was not good. She cried and cried and DEMANDED an ambulance. We thought she had broken a bone. Nope. We called the ambulance, cherry goo trailing behind her. When the ambulance gets there, and that my now bruised and aching lower body helped break her fall. They don't look so concerned. They get her out of there

the rest of the birthday was kind of awkward. John tried to call Hannah back, still cherry sauced. She borrowed one of my dresses, and made a point of calling me ""well-rounded"". We didn't have enough pie.

&gt;Living with HNCE while we were in university. House paid for by her super-rich and equally nutty sister. Free rent

&gt;FUCKYEAH.teamamerica

&gt;Know AA from psyche class. Seems nice enough

&gt;AA says he needs a place for ""just a couple of weeks"" until he gets his new place straightened out. We have spare room

&gt;Ohtobeyoungagain.exe

&gt;Regret looms immediately after seeing his laundry.

&gt;Fast Forward three weeks. AA is still there. New species of fungus has evolved from the room we lent him. Creepy smell that HNCE and I won't go near. This is how ""The Last of Us"" must have started

&gt;Notice that our food stores depleting rapidly. What once lasted us a month now got us barely through the week. AA claimed he would buy his own food when he moved in. Tried to blame HNCE

&gt;HNCE and I hatch plan to use hidden camera plant (which we previously used for taping us having sex) to catch AA in the act. Take the poor camera into the kitchen

GodModeNaive.bat

&gt;HNCE and I leave for weekend. Come back and watch film. We thought we were clever

&gt;Repulsed when we started hearing sounds of porn in the living room

&gt;Seconds after sounds end

&gt;Is that thunder?

&gt;The camera literally shakes at the footfalls of AA's lumbering frame. The camera then taped the evidence of AA reaching into the fridge

&gt;Taken aback with unmitigated horror when we realize that we had not heard the sounds of a sink or other handwashing device.

&gt;He denied eating our food. Showed AA the video. Claimed it was his

&gt;Kicked him out that day. Spent the next month detoxing the room he stayed in

More from AA later!

No greentext because im on my phone.

Be me

Visiting my gf's home home (not her uni house) to meet the family and see her.

She tells me that some of her friends are meeting up in a bar to catch up

Be that evening

Meet her friends, guys also in a variety of sizes. All really friendly and quite intelligent. I let my gf go catch up while i play pool with some of the guys.

Halfway through the game

An earthquake? In ruddy old blighty? Highly unlikely.

The culprit appears from round the corner. Roughly 5'6

She waddles around the pool table

Whatever

Game ends

As i'm done paying

Its the bumblelard. Before i get to say anything

I nope out

Now, just honest.

I stammer out ""i'm sorry

BL: ""i thought you were buying me a drink

Me: ""Why would i buy a complete stranger a drink? And why would you think i want to kiss you?!""

By this time

BL: ""because you obviously find me attractive! I saw the way you looked at me earlier! And you should feel lucky that i've picked you

Me: ""I'm sorry, and if you will excuse me i need to get back to my girlfriend""

BL: "" How can you not like this?! (She waved her free hand over her body) And who's your girlfriend? That skinny thing? (She pointed at one of my gf's friends who was walking past and smiled at me). I'm taking this drink anyway!""

By this point

Me: ""If you take that drink

BL

I signal to the bouncer that she's getting too much to handle

Me: ""No

I could see her boiling at that point. I let go of the mixer so that the bouncer could pull her away if needed.

What happens next is somewhat crazier. Instead of just taking the drink and waddling off (which is what i expected)

I dodge

At that point

Another bouncer shows up

I left an extra tip because of it

Tl;dr: fatty tries to steal drink

1368230077.0,1e3nj0,A hamplanet and moon orbit into the clinic.,Combustablesquirrel,606,90,94,"Be a 23 year old combat medic. Be crippled and have to walk with a cane due to jump injuries after the war. [feelsbadman.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4A0L7Rh.jpg) 

I get temporarily assigned to working in a clinic until the army can figure out what to do with me. My doctor that I'm assigned to is a drunk and I have to run my section of the clinic on my own. **All of my rage**. A good benefit was that I was forced to learn my craft much faster and more fully than most medics at clinics. I see mostly soldiers

One day, nor an exaggeration. My main exam room was close to the admin area, and I can usually feel a slight vibration when people walk by. [This was different](http://i.imgur.com/2k23GGA.gif).

I get a knock on my door and it's admitting nurse Smiley. ""Hey Squirrel

Fuck. I pulled up the file on the computer and stopped nurse smiley. ""Hey

""I did.""

""Is the machine broken? The patient is 13 and has a higher BP than I do. And mine is so bad that I'm walking the borderline of needing medication.""

""Wait till you see him. I'll walk them back.""

I start prepping to redo the vitals manually when my water bottle starts doing the Jurassic Park shuffle again. I had the briefest feeling of ""Oh no"" when nurse Smiley opened the door and led Jupiter and Ganymede into my room. 

Fuck.

I told Ganymede to hop up on the exam table while feeling deep concern that I'd have to drag it out to the artillery range later. The smell was horrendous. 

For the sake of privacy

I asked Jupiter what Ganymede's diet consisted of. ""Well

""No

""Well McDonalds. He gets angry if I don't give it to him"". 

At this point

Something broke in me when she said that. A little voice said ""Fuck this

""Ma'am

I took a set of vitals off the kid. And then I took a set of vitals off me. 

""You see this, this kid's heart is actually struggling to keep up with his mass. Frankly, I've never seen anything like it.""

""Ma'am, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard from a parent. If you weren't such a tub of fat, I'd ask you how it feels knowing you're going to bury your son, but you look like you probably won't make it past fifty."" 

I had just set fire to Jupiter's atmosphere.

She was shrieking like a banshee at me and calling me every name in the book. Promising up and down that my career was over. No shit, Rank, and Unit. Because I'm all about helping and I didn't want another medic with a similar name to get in trouble in my place. 

Then I heard the clapping. No

She noticed it about the same time I did and I starting chuckling and handed her the information sheet. That's when it happened. She straight up slapped me as hard as she could. Tubs of fun had an arm on her

I did clinic duty another month before being transferred to an on-post combat oriented medic school as an instructor. AWWWW YEEEAAAHH!

Part one links to my 1st 2 encounters with Kirby

So First of all, because SHE SAID YES!! YAY ARMY BRO!!!!

Second, my cousin's wife went into labor for 20 hours, then had a c-section, then I had to mow my grandma's lawn, got sunburned doing so, ya know, life happened, this will be worse than the last follow up. If you lose them

&gt;Be waiting to take chair I re-covered for Kirby's mom down to them when they get home.

&gt;So, PM gets out, waves, yells for me to come down ASAP

&gt;she's pissed

&gt;tell her everything

&gt;Kirby comes waddling out like nothing happened

&gt;[mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/m6VJh.gif) bitch are you SERIOUS?!

&gt;I kind of just ignore her and hand the chair to PM (it was a small kitchen chair

&gt;PM unleashes a tirade of insults and reprimands at Kirby

&gt;Kirby freezes in shock

&gt;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?! WHY WOULD YOU TELL THEM ABOUT THAT AWFUL NIGHT THAT EVERYONE BULLIED ME?!?! AND NOW THEY'RE YELLING AT MEEEEE?!?! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!

&gt;[my literal face when she says we bullied her] (http://i.imgur.com/LSkTs.gif)

&gt;calmly tell her a laundry list of reasons that no one wants her back in our group, PM and PD agree

&gt;without thinking

&gt;Kirby's face literally turns red 

&gt;YELLS at me that I encouraged army bro to pick FAB and calls me a backstabbing cunt

&gt;she turns

&gt;PM apologizes profusely

&gt;I talk with PM and PD for about 30 mins about their trip and my phone starts going crazy

&gt;army bro says to come home NOOOOOWWW

&gt;go home

Here are the messages copy/pasted

&gt;she sent [this] (http://youtu.be/AcmNX4llujc) song to him first, and I talked to PM &amp; PD

&gt;Army Bro responded to the first message with the video in it

2nd Message to Army bro:
Army Bro
Why??? I KNOW U have 2 feel sumthing for me, mom and dad won't ever know. I just cant except that U wud want to MERRY a girl that wud dump water in sum1's lap n call them names. U have my #, text me when U R comin over. I can cook U dinner 2.""

This was FAB response from army bro's account:
""Listen Kirby
We REALLY don't know why you have this delusion that army bro is in to you. He has made it clear from the very start that he and I are together, Kirby. I will also never apologize for the water incident or the names that I called you because you pushed and pushed and pushed, until I couldn't take any more of your delusional bullshit, and your jabs at myself and my relationship. And for acting EXTREMELY insane. WE WILL CALL THE POLICE IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE US ALONE. We have more than enough proof that you have been harassing us, and witnesses to boot. I FULLY EXPECT this to be the last time we ever talk, and that you ever contact army bro again. GOOD.BYE.""

The response that finally made Army Bro call the police and press charges:
""LISTEN YOU SKINNY BITCH, TWIG SHAPED SLUT. I may have anger issues I admit, but it's only cuz ppl won't except the FACT, yeah, F-A-C-T, that big is beautiful, n always try to shame me into being tha thin bitch that society wants me 2 B. I will never B that, BEAUTIFUL, what, U R the delusional one tot hink he aint N to me

&gt;at this point army bro is in full rage mode, says....""fuck it. I'm calling the police""

&gt;police arrive, and tells them about the crotch grab.

&gt;cop asks where she lives

&gt;we all look at each other and say...""three houses down""

&gt;one of the deputies goes outside and pulls around and parks in Kirby's driveway

&gt;The blinds are open and the window is open because it was a cool breeze kind of night

&gt;we see Kirby being hauled out in handcuffs, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs to please not take her, she will really leave him alone now

&gt;then the freaking unthinkable happens

&gt;Kirby. RUNS. Just takes off down the street. Not very fast

&gt;Trips in the ditch and rolls, ya know

&gt;Cop 1 that had followed cop 2 out of the door

&gt;she starts twisting around

&gt;They finally have to wrestle her into the back seat

&gt;Cop 2 stays in cruiser

&gt;cop 1 comes back and informs us that she has a prior record of harassment and a restraining order against her from someone else.

&gt;thatactuallydoesntsurpriseus.jpg

&gt;Kirby is charged with harassment and resisting arrest (we know this for sure now) and army bro fully intends on the protection order being filed

&gt;PM comes down and apologizes to army bro

&gt;GO PM!

&gt;says she is having her evaluated once she is released because she honestly thinks she is a danger and is bonafide CRAZY

&gt;we all hug PM and tell her we know she has tried to help in the past. Kirby is just nuts.

&gt;I get a text from Kirby today saying she is so sorry

&gt;yathink?!.mpeg

&gt;i tell her to lose all of our numbers, EXCLUDES her crazy ass.

&gt;The end?????? We shall see. 

I may pick up a few stories here and there still being friends with PM. I'll post them if she does any more crazy ass stuff.

hahahaha^ha you guys thought it was really over this time?^ha So did I


So this morning I was checking the mail and there were a letter to me, the gist of it is, ""please take me back, I'll do anything! I know I've acted a bit crazy, but that was because I love you, and I know you love me. But those whores Miranda and Jessica have filled your head with lies and been manipulating you! I know you love me, and to prove it I've included some sexy pictures of me""

It wasn't that short

Anyway, there were about 40 of them. The next more disturbing than any of the others I pulled out.

[One was like this](http://www.scenicreflections.com/ithumbs/Sexy%20Pose%20Wallpaper__yvt2.jpg) but think reaaaallyy fat and unattractive

[One looked a lot like this](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/002/a/4/juicy_in_sexy_pose_by_xxxxd_fxxxx-d5q4mbz.jpg)

In a few, donken bags, MAX bags, sibylla bags, and one Burger King bag. [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhl8iZMzK1qanohb.jpg) I saw the BK bag, the closest BK is like 2-3 hours away.

Anyway, she sighed under her breath ""you fucking liar"" Guess that means the mother is as crazy as the daughter eh? So I demand to speak with everyone present, luckily everyone was home. We gather in the kitchen, the rest of the house was really clean in comparison to the room she took the pictures in. I pull the envelope from my pocket and smirk comes across the mothers face and the daughter practically yells ""DID YOU LIKE THEM! I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE THEM!""

I throw them at the father yelling ""THIS SHIT IS FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE! THE ONLY FUCKING REASON THESE ARE NOT WITH THE FUCKING POLICE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE FUCKING MOVING AND GETTING A PSYCHIATRIST FOR THE LOONY!"" The mother gasps and say ""DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO US LIKE THAT!""

&gt;Jessicas mom, comes home just as I was done and insists I take some money for this invaluable service

&gt;Just as I were leaving The Manatees mom

&gt;Siv insists I stay as she wants me to hear this as well

&gt;Thinking The Manatee told some awful tale of fake goodness I brace myself

&gt;Siv says The Manatee wants to apologize for yelling and calling Jessica names and for pushing her

&gt;Karin asks if this is true

&gt;What

&gt;She told the truth? Has Thor blessed our lives yet again?

&gt;lol nope

&gt;The Manatee looks really embarassed but don't say anything after a minute Siv chimes in

&gt;""Shes sorry that she yelled and called you names. And for pushing you""

&gt;""Isn't that right sweetie?"" The Manatee responds with ""yeah""

&gt;Siv continues

&gt;""You should try to get your own boyfriend""

&gt;lol wat

&gt;""Now come on Ploggy

&gt;The Manatee goes in to grab my arm and drag me away to Niflheim

&gt;I pull back, never will be, not even if she was the last female on the planet

&gt;""Don't be silly

&gt;She says something that can only be translated to ""the internets""

&gt;At this point Jessica chimes in saying ""That's not how it happened""

&gt;Jessica says ""The Manatee did yell

&gt;Siv yells ""Are you calling my daughter a liar!? ~~I'll have you know that both my daughter and I graduated at the top of our class in eating school with over 300 confirmed curves....~~""

&gt;Jessica whimpers out a ""No"" and looks ready to cry

&gt;""Didn't think so! All you skinny sluts do is lie to get a man you otherwise couldn't get! You dont have to lie just because Ploggy likes woman with some meat on her and not your boney ass!""

&gt;I see tears ready to form in Jessica eyes and a smirk on The Manatees fat face

&gt;I step in saying ""What Jessica said is how it happened. And yes I am calling your daughter a liar""

&gt;The Manatee in shock says ""But baby that's not how it happaned what kind of lies has she filled in your head? Lets go home have a *snack* and talk about this.""

&gt;I say ""No

&gt;The Manatee roars out ""WHAT KIND OF LIES DID YOU TELL HIM YOU WHORE!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO TURN HIM AGAINST ME!?

&gt;And she lets out a desperate plea ""Come on Ploggy

&gt;I say again no and point to their house and yet again say leave.

&gt;This time The Manatee roars out ""YOU FUCKING WHORE!"" And ~~lunges~~ waddles at quicker pace than normal at Jessica

&gt;I push The Manatee which can best be described by this [gif](http://i.imgur.com/QxIY8.gif)

&gt;Siv as a look of shock on her face and quickly ~~rushes~~ waddles over to help her daughter

&gt;They quickly leave and say we should expect to hear from their lawyers

&gt;I look over at Jessica and she seems really frightend and I look at Karin who has this face that can only be described with ""Is this really happening? Is this real life?""

&gt;I say I'm sorry and quickly retreat to my house

Later when Karins husband came home they invited my parents over for their house for a drink. Don't know if they told my parents about this and when they came back they said nothing to me about it.

This one needs a little introduction for the story to make sense

I have literally no opinions on the religion anyone chooses to have (or not have in the case of atheism) if you're keeping it mainly to yourself and you extend the same courtesy to me, that has been in my family for generations. 

It's pretty much a mixture of shamanism, witch doctoring and all sorts of things. It's far less interesting than it sounds, its pretty much making crazy teas and pounding up herbs with a big rock. I love it, it's what I believe, and I'm always prepared to answer questions. With me so far? 

Sadly my beliefs attract the spiritual equivalent of weaboos

ANYWAY I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS CRAZY but it's central to the story. Which is starting now. Thanks for your patience! 

This takes place about 3 months after the last story was set. 

&gt;Be me. Piplup, still in the UK. small, have eating disorder. 

&gt; NotBe Hammah. BFF at the time, mega goth. Really fat, probably about 270 but kinda looks more. 

Her fashion style consists of tank tops in EXTREMELY TOO SMALL sizes, so half her ass is always on show. Basically because she shops at ""goth stores"" (like hot topic i guess) and she wants to be small and teeny and cute. 

&gt;be at my house trying to finish group project

&gt;Hamma bouncing up and down on my bed while I try to work.

&gt; ""PIPLUP I'M BOOOOOORED""

I know how to handle this. 

&gt;""Go look in the fridge for something to eat"" 

The fridge had beetus juices and candy I had prepared earlier. I am becoming quite the ham wrangler. 

Hammah comes back

&gt;""PIPLUUUUUP are there any guys you like at school teehee"" 

&gt;""No."" 

&gt;""But &gt;Insert underage victim one&lt; totally thinks I'm hot and he's so emoooo"" 

Hammah had previously gotten in to shit for having sex with a 14 year old. This guy was 13. 

&gt;""He's too young for you.

&gt;""Piplup you're STUPID

wat

&gt;""and ANYWAY piplup men can't resist me

&gt;""I know men like boobs Hammah"" 

Do I really need to tell you how this continued? HAES bullshit, he's now on some pedophile hunting site) how older men know ""what they're doing"". How I need to eat more, how my undereating ""makes her feel fat"". UGH. 

She starts rifiling through my books and various god statues. 

&gt;""I didn't know you believed in GODS Piplup

wat2. 

She sees my statue of Sakhmet. She has a lion's head and it's made to look ancient Egyptian. 

&gt;""WELL OF COURSE YOU LIKE THIS ONE

Literally throws my statue to the floor. That disrespect. PleaseThorStrikeHerDown. Bitch I will spit in your eyes. I manage to keep my cool however. 

&gt;""she's actually more like a war goddess"" 

AND THE GODDESS OF VENGEANCE YOU FAT BITCH. 

Hamplanet not listening

&gt;""THAT STATUE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. ANCIENT PEOPLE THOUGHT FAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. SKINNY PEOPLE LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE JUST DIED"" 

Idon'teven. 

&gt;""DON'T YOU HAVE ANY REAAAAL WOMEN TO WORSHIP"" 

Bitch this is my religion not a fat activism party. 

Hammah finally gets her fucking laptop out

So I don't remember it word for word but she literally searched for ""goddesses for fat women"" or some shit. What the everliving fuck. But ok

""Artists interpretations of Aphrodite show her as a plus size

&gt;""OHHH MYYY GODDD PIPLUP SEE. SEE. PLUS SIZE MEANS OBESE. YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME MORE ABOUT YOUR RELIGION BECAUSE FAT WORSHIP IS IMPORTANT"" 

Yeah guys [the very picture of obesity](http://www.theoi.com/image/S10.1Aphrodite.jpg)

&gt;""That's not really what it's about Hammah"" 

&gt;YOU'RE SO SELFISH. ITS NOT MY FAULT MY FAMILY GAVE ME A FAT HATING RELIGION"" 

Apparently Christianity is ""fat hating"" I have no idea so I had no argument. 

She actually looks like she might cry. Sigh. Why do I care. 

&gt;""No Hammah

I hand her a book which has a detailed description of a few of the more ""popular"" gods. And some notebooks and stuff I have from the school. I pretty much am morally and spiritually obligated to share what I know if people ask

A few days later

""Omg piplup, and I can FINALLY be confident. Maybe if you REALLY believe in your religion, you should stop trying to starve yourself and stop wearing so much makeup. NATURAL is better. 

Anyway I found some spells I want to try in this wicca bible i found online

So at that point the blood vessel in my temple exploded and I died. 

I wish. 

To you non religious people, a TV show, that you freaking loved, and knew all the ins and outs of. It meant something to you, and to this day it still hits you with that beautiful, all consuming rush of warm nostalgia. 

Ok now imagine that a fat beast has taken it, or be as much of a fan of it as they are, and they've only known about it for a whole weekend! Teehee! Oh and also NOTHING YOU CAN EVER SAY WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND. 


So. Obviously I have loads of stories about Hammah's new found religion

There's a hippy/alt/green faire held round here. I always go because I know people who do

(oh did i mention that she bought a magic wand and a pentagram necklace? cos she did

At the incense store

&gt;""sorry but at least you smell nice!"" 

socialfailure.exe

Nice guy actually laughs (call him Orange from now on cos thats the colour he was wearing). I SEE HE HAS AN ANUBIS TATTOO. I LOVE THAT GOD. 

&gt;strike up awesome conversation about Kemetic gods. Shit is cash. 

&gt;decide to get some food

&gt;have lost Hammah because she's trying to envelop random men in her folds. 

Oh no wait here she is. I forgot that food was involved. 

It dawns on me that Orange is ""alternative"" AND Asian. He is now prime meat in Hammah's eyes. 

I'm so sorry Orange what have I done to you. :( 

So yeah

""HEY I'M PIPLUPS BEST FRIEND

nooooooo :( 

&gt;Orange ""oh! yeah *gasping for breath* I'm interested in some of the gods myself"" 

&gt;""HOW ABOUT APHRODITE DO YOU LIKE HER"" 

&gt;orange -""Oh

&gt;""WELL I'M EXACTLY LIKE APHRODITE

It's so cringeworthy at this point that I kinda want to just bail and leave Orange to fend for himself, kissing his shoulder, telling him how she LOOOVES tattoos, and asking him if he would like to see her naked so he could tell her the best place for a tattoo. 

I sort of regret doing this

&gt;""Oh Hammah stop it, for a start, Aphrodite didn't have a muffin top."" 

This was a huge shock for her. I have never stepped in or ""cockblocked"" her before. But I was getting pretty tired. Guys

""You're just jealous"". 

Up to this point Orange had been silent. And what he said was so simple

""I bet if Piplup was sat on my lap I could still feel my legs though"". 

3. 2. 1.

MELTDOWN. 

""I BET YOU'D LOVE THAT WOULDN'T YOU. WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER

She bent down

Guys she threw grass in my face. It was hilarious

tl;dr fatty creates her own HAES religion and throws grass in my eyes while i save an asian from giving her tattoo advice.

1374084251.0,1ii17k,Muh Muh’s Odyssey Part V: Epilogue (By M. Night. Shamalan) [Kinda NSFL],ConfectionAffection,621,116,108,"[Part I]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/)  [Part II]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h57yk/the_much_anticipated_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_ii_muh/)  [Part III]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1h96p8/muh_muhs_odyssey_part_iii_from_beetus_to_worse/)  [Part IV]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i5u5g/muh_muhs_odyssey_part_iv_enter_the_wildebeetus/)

I spelled Shyamalan wrong

Warning: even for my standards

FPS, only one section of this epilogue is NSFL and it is a compendium of sorts of the details about Muh Muh that I left out because this isn’t [r/WTF](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/), but a few people requested so I will deliver. If you are looking for inspiration to get healthy, this might be a good read. First read the other parts linked above so you know who I’m talking about, if you haven't already. 

There are also two plot twists in this epilogue

**What Happened to the Kids**

Since I didn’t spell it out in the story, they left the kids. Daughtermoon was hiding, and we the employees forgot about her too in the commotion. Something I didn’t mention in the story is that although the Wildebeetus was crazy and mean and vulgar, it became apparent by his body language and the constant reddening of his face (which I didn’t put in the story) that he was embarrassed by this situation.

When you think about, he was in a big hurry to leave that store.

So, GHB, and myself) went and found Daughtermoon and the baby and took them to Flabby Patty’s disgusting, litter-filled cave (to make them feel at home), whereupon the Wildebeest was redialed. He yelled at my manager again, saying his step daughter would there to pick up Daughtermoon and *the step daughter’s baby.* He couldn’t come get them because he had to take Muh Muh to the hospital directly after they left. Plot twist #1 is that the baby was not, in fact, it was her grandchild.

As my coworkers conjectured on what kind of hambeast would appear to collect her (half) sister and child, she was a nice, quiet, and only slightly overweight woman. I didn’t tell my coworkers that I knew this or how I knew this, and never did. Sure enough, she walked in and we locked eyes, any trace of doubt was erased from my mind at that point. She turned away

One bright spot is that Daughtermoon was ecstatic to see her half-sister

**Musings on Muh Muh**

Let’s first discuss Muh Muh’s entrance, I would estimate her weight to be between 600-650lbs, slightly less than what I originally estimated in Part I. The difference is Muh Muh was older than this woman, and also smoked like a chimney so she did not have this woman’s skin tone. Muh Muh’s fat was more rolls and layers. However, the woman in the picture has legs that were very similar in shape to Muh Muh’s, and with that image let me list a few things not mentioned in the story. Engage NSFL.

I mentioned Muh Muh had sores. She had many, [here’s the closest approximation]( http://archive.ispub.com/journal/the-internet-journal-of-dermatology/volume-1-number-2/diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers.article-g05.ns.jpg) I could find to the leg sores Muh Muh had. And [don’t forget the feet]( http://archive.ispub.com/journal/the-internet-journal-of-dermatology/volume-1-number-2/diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers.article-g06.ns.jpg), which were worse. Muh Muh’s sores were glistening too, actively oozing interstitial fluids and pus, as diabeetus sores are wont to do. 

If you don’t know, but when this lack of circulation gets bad enough, whole bits of tissue begin to die completely and necrose. Muh Muh had a grand total of one toenail (the big one on her “good” foot), and the two of her toes on the bad foot were nearly black. Google it if you’re curious, I don’t even want to see the pictures of dead toes—one real life experience was enough for me.

Another observation that was revolting beyond belief and one that I noticed upon her entrance was the spots. I’m not gonna pussyfoot around this, Muh Muh had shit herself. No one wanted to touch that cart, as it had a big wet spot in the middle that smelled… well, you know.

Speaking of, mix in BO and unpleasant odors wafting from her luscious curves and you get a truly horrendous smell. But those smells were practically perfume compared to the distinct olfactory affronts of gangrenous tissue (dead, rotting tissue aka tissue with gangrene). Don’t ask me how I already knew how that smelled already, but I did. It is a smell you don’t forget, disgusting beyond belief but with a perverse sweetness to it. I’m gagging, I have to stop. End NSFL.

I know definitively that Muh Muh would not have made it out of the house *without* her extreme state of inebriation. A combination of an extreme alcohol addiction and “drunk strength” apparently allowed her to make it into the car from her house

**The Damages**

Ms. BB was fired almost immediately after the police report and internal incident report were filed. Yes, which she chose not to do, likely from extreme apathy. She also demanded the “fucking Mexicans” clean up the mess (which they began to do) despite warnings that it was a biohazard mess. Flabby Patty eventually put his foot down, and the janitors put some absorbent material over the mess, roped it off and left it until the wee hours the next day when a biohazard disposal team came and finished the job. Her insistence that they clean it up, however, was witnessed by many and this was another big no-no. 

One the biohazard cleanup was finished, in an extreme effort to make it look like we were biohazard safe, every bit of merchandise that had even a speck of red on it was to be thrown away. Much of this liquor (some was quite expensive) and craft beer really had little to no stains on it, and much of it ended up in GHB’s and my cars via “operation drunken eagle.” 

The wine splatter went up to the top shelves even

After all was said and done, we moved all the merchandise off about a total of six, 20ft sections of shelf that were unbolted from the floor, cleaned again using biohazard procedures, sanded, rewaxed, etc.

The cleanup (including sanding and resealing), the teams hired to move the shelves, a second cleanup with sanding etc., and employee labor all coalesced onto an incident report for a figure well over $15 thousand (the cart alone was over $3,000). I know this because I took Ms. BB’s place after she got fired, and had access to all the info. Granted, these reports were sometimes bloated for tax purposes or some shit

**My Big Secret**

I tried to make it as non-obvious as possible because I fuckin’ love a plot twist

The truth is I thought Muh Muh looked familiar when she lumbered in, but I didn’t let myself believe it. I had to get a closer look, no small part of why I was observing her (wasn’t just random curiosity). 

I counted on my fingers how many years it had been since I’d seen her last, I played with the older daughter that came in to pick up Daughtermoon and the baby, in fact I wrote about it in a previous story. I dubbed her Side O’ Ham. That’s right Reddit, on that fateful, stormy night, I witnessed by dearest Auntie Ham walk into my ‘Mart—about 250 lbs heavier than when last I saw her in [Auntie Ham’s Brush with Death]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvoo0/auntie_hams_brush_with_death/). She never realized it was me.

**What Happened to Muh Muh**

The last thing I will inform you all about, weird-ass sister speaks to my granny on a regular basis, and is a terrible gossip. Plus my granny was a nurse still at that point, and regularly went to visit Auntie Hamuh Muh, and granny filled me and my family in on all the details as they happened.

My Auntie went to the hospital that night, and had a number of nutrient deficiencies (the irony!) That was all they could determine and it was from blood work, because they had no machines to handle her girth—no ultrasound would go deep enough to view her organs, the various machines would not fit her (small, local hospitals don’t have much). 

She was taken immediately to a larger hospital in a larger town about an hour away, but first medication was given to heal the ulcers in her stomach and was put on a liquid diet. Massive amounts of blood were transfused, along with massive doses of extremely powerful antibiotics. At the same time, she was also going into a double whammy of withdrawals from no alcohol or cigarettes, and to hear her sister tell it “it was a good thing she couldn’t get outta bed or she would’ve murdered all the hospital workers!”

She lost something like 40 lbs in the next week, so a few days later, most of her thigh was removed. I cannot imagine the logistics of such an operation, and we all knew that her chances of making it through these procedures alive were slim, but it seemed there was no choice. Somehow, the tough old bitch made it through, though

Eventually Auntie Hamuh Muh left the hospital with a prosthetic leg and about 250 lbs lighter (including the lost leg). In the absence of cigarettes and alcohol, she walked better with that than she did with her actual leg that night I saw her in the ‘Mart. Then she was forgotten after a time, as she remained a recluse when she was no longer an interesting source of gossip for her sister. I haven’t seen her other than from a distance since that incident at the ‘Mart 5 years ago. 

I would like to tell you she somehow made it. That she continued to lose weight, and got a job. But I can’t, because none of those things happened. The only silver lining is that the mentally unstable, abusive Wildebeetus left her just before she was released from the hospital. I have two more stories at least about Auntie Hamuh Muh told from the perspective of my granny and my mom that happened recently, so the good news is you fatties get more Muh Muh, just in an altered form. I said it when I first started writing here, I joined FPS to tell you about this creature. All my other stories are fluff pieces to this train wreck of a woman. She is the quintessential hamplanet, then let me assure you that you will get moar Auntie Hamuh Muh.

Final thought: Healthy at Every Size my ass.

Me 'Hey! You're Sarah's mom right?'

SM (Sarah's mom. She's one of those soccer moms. Pretty

Me 'Yes she's been wonderful! But I wanted to ask you

SM'Yes. She mentioned she didn't get them though. Did another child take them? If they did it's not big deal

Me 'Well

SM 'What the hell? Pardon my language but what the hell is wrong with her? Is she eating Cool Whip? Did you report her?'

Me 'Yes and yes. The director accused me of lying. The director is actually related to the teacher assistant.'

SM turned and stalked down the hall, but I shrugged it off.

The director called me to her office

'Excuse me?!' She gaped at me.

'I didn't stutter.'

At this point

So I went back to class

'Did you take my daughter's cookies?'

'N-n-no.'

'Did. You. Take. My. Daughter's. Cookies.'

'Well

'That's irrelevant. Just like you. But DID YOU TAKE THE COOKIES?'

She's crying at this point. 'Yes. Okay? YES! Leave me alone! She didn't need them! I need the sugar! I didn't have lunch!'

'No

'If you touch my daughter's food again

She nodded

I smiled at her very sweetly as SM walked away.

Yesterday's post was a mere 2000 calorie appetizer to today's 10-course meal of how I narrowly avoided becoming a hamplanet myself.

This is the story of how I disenrolled myself from self-imposed hamplanet training for the sake of love. If you want to know how it ends

It's a long-un

Here goes:

&gt;Be me in middle school. 

&gt;I wasn't a hamplanet

&gt;No fatlogic with me. Dad was paramedic and even tested my blood sugar before and after a big meal

&gt;No beetus, no exercise, and a complete lack of motivation to do... anything.

&gt;Wherever I went

&gt;You don't want to know where the south pole was. 

&gt;Go to church one evening for reasons I forget. 

&gt;See an octopus on the church floor.

&gt;""That's odd

&gt;Octopus slowly untangles itself to reveal its true form.

Here's where it takes the opposite tone of your typical FPS.

&gt;All of a sudden

&gt;Rays of sunshine start shining despite the fact that we were indoors.

&gt;I hear a heavenly choir singing.

&gt;Octopus reveals its true form to be O

&gt;Blonde, more beautiful than Nina Sayers.

&gt;I get hit in the face with her beauty without any chance to prepare myself.

&gt;My jimmies were not ready for this. 

&gt;loveatfirstsight.exe

&gt;THERE'S THAT MOTIVATION I WAS LOOKING FOR

&gt;Resolve to change.

&gt;Join middle school track team to throw (alwayslast.weak)

&gt;Need more than that to undo years of hamplanet training

&gt;Resolve to join high school's wrestling team when that time rolls (teehee) around. 

&gt;That fall

&gt;Get weighed

&gt;199 pounds

&gt;Ouch.shame

&gt;Get sports physical

&gt;Look at BMI chart

&gt;Find myself on the ""obese"" area of the chart

&gt;sadness.jpg

&gt;moarmotivation.letsdothis

&gt;Do off-season wrestling weight-lifting workouts

&gt;Basically

&gt;Decide to run on top of that.

&gt;Can't run (read: barely jog) more than 100m at a time.

&gt;Feelsbadman.jpg

&gt;Run with backpack

&gt;Football team assumes I am putting rocks in my backpack to train harder

&gt;Every week

&gt;Skip ahead to homecoming

&gt;Run a mile every day

&gt;Feelsgoodman.fuckyeah

&gt;Wrestling season rolls around

&gt;Quit.

&gt;Not because of fatlogic

&gt;Keep it up every day. 

&gt;Eventually increase running to 30 minutes

&gt;Track season rolls around

&gt;Join track team again

&gt;Weigh 150 pounds.

&gt;1 mile time decreased from 11:45 to sub seven minutes during this time

&gt;cantstopme.motherfucker

&gt;Fast forward to now.

&gt;Never got to date ballerina. :\

&gt;Weigh 191 pounds

&gt;Wouldntchangeathing.awesome

&gt;Gonna make it you guys

tl;dr: I decide to change my life from being a future hamplanet to getting in shape out of love. Never get that love

EDIT: [Final Part Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e47cz/hamburglar_eats_us_out_of_house_and_home_sweet/)

*Our story left off with poor OP getting off the bus and realizing she is billeted in the same house as Hamburglar*

&gt;Get off bus and receive billets

&gt;Only 3 beds

&gt;Ohlawdy.jpg

&gt;Despite being all girls, absolute amazing singer, Sportybro: Really athletic Asian girl, Arabro: Arabic girl who is your stereotypical teenage girl, and Koreandramabro: Melodramatic Asian girl in the worst way possible

&gt;Nobody in the house is the least bit fat except for Hamburglar

&gt;Everyone has to get on the Greyhound again and go out of town for groceries to last us 2 weeks

&gt;Everyone splits up to buy what they want

&gt;We all pick out a mixture of healthy food and total crap, pizzas, pretty decent haul

&gt;Everyone going to give me $20 and I'll pay for everyone's groceries on my card

&gt;Hamburglar laborously waddles over to us with her haul

&gt;Nothing but mountains of crap, mayo, Munchies, Doritos, Cheesies, soda, a little microwave food

&gt;""Oh most of this stuff is on sale anyways

&gt;throws it all onto the conveyor belt and hands me $20

&gt;Fuckingwhatever.mov

&gt;Get home

&gt;Everyone brushing teeth

&gt;Tackle the 3 bed

&gt;Smilebro and Sportybro share room/bed with Talentbro and Arabro in the other bed

&gt;Hamburglar doesn't even fit on the couch

&gt;Koreandramabro doesn't let me get a wink of sleep

&gt;Hamburglar's Shamu-Quality sonar hearing picks up on Koreandramabro and comes into the room to discuss her non-existent sexcapades with Wailord

&gt;Actual quote: ""Some days I have dreams of Wailord and I cuddling... I'm in trouble and he just saves me and holds me close to his heart. I know he loves me but I'm waiting until we're married to have sex

&gt;WhyGod.Nope

&gt;Have nightmares that night about rule 34 on Koreandramabro and Hamburglar with Wailord watching from the corner and masturbating

&gt;Worst dream ever

&gt;Morning comes and we all wake up to a messy kitchen. Wrappers everywhere, ugh

&gt;Turns out Hamburglar is the opposite of a Gremlin and must eat as much as possible at night

&gt;Smilebro is making her famous grilled cheese sandwiches for us for breakfast

&gt;Awyisss.mp3

&gt;Day of choir shit goes by

&gt;I volunteer to sleep on the Isle of Couchland for the night so I can actually get some sleep

&gt;Wake up in the middle of the night to Hamburglar feasting again

&gt;Runs back into her room faster than Usain Bolt on cocaine

&gt;Next 4 days or so uneventful

&gt;That night we force Hamburglar to wash all the dishes for the evening

&gt;Hamburglar very slow at washing

&gt;Takes literally ALL our plates

&gt;With a thunderous crash louder than her thighs slapping together when she walks

&gt;No survivors

&gt;Unfortunately she is unharmed

&gt;""IT'S NOT MY FAULT

&gt;Dramatically runs into bathroom to cry

&gt;Have to eat from bowls from now on

&gt;Everyone in the house beginning to hate Hamburglar

&gt;Probably cried bacon grease tears that night

**tl;dr: Baby baluga Hamburglar is housed with my friends and I, then when we ask her to wash the dishes ONCE, she fucks it up and manages to break all the dishes in the house then locks herself in the bathroom to avoid cleaning up her own mess.**

1374614530.0,1iwtsp,Some FPSs are Really Sad,FakeCakeShake,581,82,156,"I have a short story about a family of hamplanets that I saw while eating at a restaurant one night.

My daughter went to CeCe's Pizza one night with one of her friends, and they have games, so it's a win-win for her.

Unfortunately

Normally, I decided to indulge her. She's a smart girl, who doesn't overeat and really loves video games. So, here we go for $5 all-you-can-eat pizza.

We got there just after the lunch rush and before supper. We gathered some lukewarm rubbery pizza and sat down at a table across from ahamplanet family. There was a mother hamplanet

The young hamplanet was one of the saddest sights I've ever seen. The mom and aunt were bringing him plates stacked high with pizza and desserts, too. He filled out the booth bench. He was even larger than the other members of his family.

The saddest part was that he was young. Probably 8 or 9. He looked very sick and pale. My daughter kept watching him

My heart was broken for him because his mom had gotten him three plates full of pizza

Last time we saw Saggy, there is something far worse than Saggy being ungrateful for my help: 

Her being grateful for it.

You see, *must* be her best friend. This is where the majority of the fatlogic starts to show up. 

Engage BEST FRIEND GREENTEXT

&gt; be me, when I feel a large, amoeboid boulder attempt osmosis with my body.

&gt; Oops

&gt; Wait

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks, he's such a creep! I don't want him coming over to the apartment anymore, ok?""

&gt; I nod my head

&gt; Her cheek muscles do their best

&gt; ""Oh I'm so glad we're friends now! I'm gonna cook you dinner like you cook for Dramagirl and me."" 

&gt; I've never cooked for her

&gt; Nod my head again.

&gt; Whale squeals are too terrible to put into words.

&gt; I flee to higher ground

**LATER THAT EVENING**

&gt; Doing homework

&gt; Hear a series of loud thuds down the hallway

&gt; ""SAGGY-SUCKS! DINNER'S READY!""

&gt; Oh god...this is gonna be aweful.

&gt; Drag myself to living room because she IS trying to be nice.

&gt; She had fried chicken, a frozen Red Baron pizza for the both of us, ~waffles?~, and there were a bunch of cupcakes on a plate from the platter she had made that morning. 

&gt; Insert gif with a super tired and/or frustrated person in it

&gt; Sit down and Saggy brings me ma plate/trough 

&gt; Eat the green beans

&gt; I did my best Saggy I swear!

&gt; Not good enough for Lady Humps.

&gt; ""Eat Saggy-Sucks! I made all this food

Note: had been talking about getting to my ideal weight with Dramagirl. That ideal weight was 10lbs lighter than my (now because of Feeder) 145.

&gt; Why does everyone want me to be fat???

&gt; ""My ideal weight is 10lbs down

&gt; Saggy rolls her eyes like I was some small

&gt; ""Saggy-Sucks that's not an ideal weight, it's just because the guy is a douchebag and he wants to hit em and quit em.""

&gt; Sooooooo....all your ""boyfriends"" ever? Don't say anything though

&gt; ""Well I already ate dinner (lie)

&gt; It worked

&gt; Oh wait yes she could.

&gt; She continues to tell me all of my problems stem from being a ""fence-post"" and I looked malnourished. She said she gets any guy she wants and she eats anything she likes. Her life is perfect.

&gt; Those last four words were barely out of her mouth before she did a complete 180 and started to describe how her life was actually the most horrible thing ever

I've been around actually suicidal people

Saggy was most certainly the latter.

&gt; Saggy stuffin her face with my portion of friend chicken

&gt; Wow I just figured out where the inspiration for those crazy chips came from.

&gt; Continued to talk for *HOURS* about how she was super depressed, her mom wouldn't give her any money for this tattoo she ~~wanted~~ needed, and none of her friends in the apartment complex wanted to talk to her anymore because their boyfriends just ""couldn't stay away from her luscious body.""

&gt; vomit.exe

&gt; Well at least now I know why Saggy has latched on to me: she has no more friends left because she's slept or has tried to sleep with all of their boyfriends. She probably bragged about it to all of them and was surprised when they reacted with anger.

&gt; She would not stop talking/whining/complaining.

&gt; I kept trying to tell her I had to do my math homework

&gt; Saggy has no time for your mortal concerns

&gt; I finally just say ""Look Saggy

&gt; Started to stand up and go back to my room.

&gt; ""Are you fucking **SERIOUS**? Saggy screams.

&gt; I turn around

&gt; She looks at me

&gt; ""I just cooked you an entire meal

Guys, grease, and butter. Disaster movies could have used it as a set for an airplane crash, a tornado aftermath, a Godzilla rampage, or all three combined. Whenever I cooked for Dramagirl and/or myself, I always cleaned as I went

&gt; ""Saggy I always clean up when I cook.""

&gt; Didn't even bother listening to her yelling and screaming about me being an ungrateful bitch

&gt; 11:58pm

&gt; Are you fucking kidding me?

&gt; She had complained about her horrible first-world problems to me for over THREE HOURS.

&gt; Sent an email to my math teacher begging for mercy and explaining what happened.

**THE NEXT DAY**

Talked to my math teacher and she said if what I said was true I needed to talk to a councellor about Saggy's suicidal attitude. She extended my homework because she was a wonderful woman.

Then I called up Dramagirl.

&gt; ""Yo we gotta get this bitch out of the apartment.""

&gt; ""I thought you'd never ask.""

So being a senior manager does have it's downsides. I had to spend my entire Sunday monitoring the set up of 100 or so upgraded computers. All fun and games when no one is noticing me becoming slowly more and more shitfaced as the day wears on. Hip flasks are amazing.

&gt;Only myself and about 4 underlings helping me out

&gt;Goddamn budgets

&gt;Better this than the dole line

&gt;Ha

&gt;Get that pub meal into me... $7 with a pint!

We begin to gather ourselves to go down. As we hit the entrance foyer

lolnope. It's just LardLover, her makeup smeared over her face, dark circles surrounding her eyes. Hell, I still feel sorry for her in a way, but all my sympathy is over taken by how she treated all of us, and the security.

*(Translators note: The following has been translated from drunk whale into Australian English. Obscenities have been left in)*

&gt;""THIS FUCKING COMPANY RUINED ME. SEE

&gt;She grabs more trash from the public bin

&gt;Olympic shot-put throw manages to get about 2m high on the 20 story building

&gt;Drunk me has lost all inhibitions

&gt;Giggles uncontrollably still inside the foyer

&gt;LardLover manages to see this over her drunken blur

&gt;""YOU FUCKING BITCH. YOU'RE THE REASON WHY I'M HERE NOW. I COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL. YOU RUINED MY ENTIRE SET UP. WHY THE FUCK DID YOU RUIN IT?! YOU JEALOUS BITCH""

&gt;""YOU PROBABLY WANTED MR DESPERATEROMANTIC""

&gt;Laugh even harder

&gt;She begins to try and charge through the automatic doors

&gt;Security shuts them off

&gt;Nooo

Security motion for her to leave, but sober me later felt fucking terrible. I know she was a horrible person to us, but seeing her so... destroyed was horrific. 

&gt;Finally leave

&gt;Beer battered chips and gravy

&gt;Get ready to leave

&gt;LardLover trips past us to the bar

&gt;Australian liquor laws mean she is escorted from the bar to a stable seat by a bouncer

&gt;""I DON'T WANT NONE OF YOUR STUPID WATER. I WANT A REAL DRINK. WATER ISN'T EVEN YUMMY""

&gt;Drunk me giggles harder

*3 of my interns were over 18

&gt;Her senses zone into us

&gt;""YOU FUCKING WHORE. YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME TO RUIN MY LIFE, YOU CUNT?""

&gt;Actually burst into full laughter

&gt;Can not breath

&gt;Bouncer escorts her out as she throws the free water on him with more accuracy than she threw trash on the building

&gt;Regain my sensibilities and order another drink and prepare to hit the bottle-o for more hip flask juice

We return to work, and finish some paper work to save time tomorrow. Not being completely inebriated, I get everything done before quitting time, and release myself and my interns early to go home and get some goddamn sleep.

&gt;Begin to head home

&gt;Be the last one out

&gt;Round the corner to the bus

&gt;See LardLover sitting in the alley behind the building

&gt;A Mcdonalds bag lay sprawled before her

&gt;Empathy kicks in

&gt;""Hey... LardLover... are you alright?""

&gt;""FUCK YOU

&gt;""Well

&gt;""I just wanted to be compensated for my suffering. Every fucking day is the same. Get up, eat, work, eat, work eat...""

&gt;She partially dozes off

&gt;""LARDLOVER

&gt;""FUCK YOU"" she screams as she lifts her head in and out of consciousness

&gt;I can't just leave her here. Fuck.

&gt;""Can I get Mr DesperateRomantic to come and get you?""

&gt;""That bag of dicks left me when I couldn't get his chair out of this goddamn building""

&gt;Things begin to come together

&gt;No sympathy

&gt;Begin to call an ambulance

&gt;""Look

&gt;Making sure they are aware of her weight

At that point, but I knew how bad it was to have no where else but an alley with a bottle as a friend.

The ambulance came about half an hour later, and was a gender traitor (lol), I heard about how Mr DesperateRomantic was the only human who wanted to talk to her at all for the past few years, and she was using sex to control the relationship. He took the first out he could, leaving her emotionally crippled. Her redundancy payment only covered about one quarter of her credit card debts, not even touching her mortgage. She was being pounced on by creditors and was isolated from any family who never wanted to talk to her... so far as I could make out, it was because they 'never helped her enough'.

They took her off

So yes, because she put herself into the situation, but I empathized with her current situation, because I have been down in the dumps with no where to go. But fuck... she isn't going anywhere but court at this point. Assaulting a bouncer, stealing from our company, public disturbances... all these charges could be laid against her.

Sorry about the jimmy's.

And sorry about the drunk writing. There may be mistakes in spelling. I decided to drown myself after becoming far too sober on the way home.

**EDIT:** One of the main reasons why I helped this heffalump, and it would not put her or myself out to send her off there. Also, if a person dies, they try and find the person who most recently contacted them. There was CCTV everywhere and the security and interns saw me laughing at her a few times yesterday. You can be charged with negligence to a certain degree, specially if you know of the person and see they are in trouble. 

And yes, I just make sure I have more sober days than drunk days. ",,False,self,t5_2vzax,1375661121.0,,

&gt;put up all season with her dumb shit

&gt;been to the principals office more times than I could count on both hands

&gt;be in chemistry class

&gt;napping because I can

&gt;hear name called on intercom, and Fishman

&gt;godfuckingdammit

&gt;be in principals office once again

&gt;fucking Bertha is there

&gt;slowly absorbing the chair she managed to stuff herself into

&gt;huge shit eating grin

&gt;her asshole brother and sister are there too

&gt;papa whale lounging on a bench nearby (couldn't fit in office..?)

&gt;principal seats us

&gt;So

&gt;exchange glanced with bros

&gt;principal glares

&gt;Don't play dumb

&gt;ohfuckingreally

&gt;we sit

&gt;So you won't admit to it?

&gt;admit to... What?

&gt;Bertha gurgles

&gt;everyone turns and looks at her

&gt;AH SAWH THEHM PUT MEAN NOTES IN MAH LOCKEH

&gt;MAKIN FUN UH MEH WEIGHT

&gt;principal turns to us

&gt;we all explain we never did anything of the sort

&gt;THEHR LIAHS AH SAW THEM DO EET

&gt;pulls out a handful of crumpled papers

&gt;all of them scribbled on in shitty ass handwriting

&gt;all the same handwriting

&gt;....Bertha's.

&gt;bros and I sit in shock

&gt;this has gone waaaaay too far

&gt;tell principal there's no proof we did anything

&gt;Bertha gurgles once more

&gt;THEH MEHD FUN UH MEH DURSLEXIA

Never mentioned this in other Bertha tales because it wasn't directly related to anything or contingent on her fatness, had straight A's, never mentioned it really except to say Bertha was bullshitting
ANYWAY
BACK INTO THE FRAY

&gt;everyone looks back and forth at each other

&gt;principal tells us it could be a serious offense to make fun of someone for having a disability

&gt;says this kind of behavior could get us expelled

&gt;pulls out some forms

&gt;says they're for an anti-bullying initiative

&gt;says before anyone can leave bros and I have to sign them

&gt;says they're just a formality but insists we sign

&gt;jesusfuckingchristwhat

&gt;bros start to comply

&gt;they pick up forms

&gt;Bertha gurgles with pleasure

&gt;oh fucking hell no

&gt;have a moment of madness

&gt;tell principal we'll sign if Bertha and her siblings sign some first

&gt;because they're a formality

&gt;they refuse

&gt;make up a bunch of shit about how the forms aren't for them

&gt;everything is red

&gt;YUH ACCUSING MEH OF LYIN? YUHR THEH LIAH

&gt;her face gets red and jowls wobble dangerously

&gt;siblings and papa whale readying themselves for attack

&gt;I set down the forms

Probably relevant to add that I'm not an angry person. I'm pretty internal about being upset, and since it's rare people never expect it.

&gt;no fucks left to give

&gt;slide out of chair

&gt;she flinches so hard her whole body jiggles

&gt;siblings are on the edge of their seats

&gt;papa whale and principal watching silently

&gt;I HAVE NO FUCKS TO GIVE

&gt;put my hands on both of Berthas armrests

&gt;lean in real close

&gt;stare right into the black

&gt;can feel her avoiding my gaze

&gt;STOP TELLING LIES. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. NO ONE CARES YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR ALLEGED DYSLEXIA. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU. SO JUST STOP.

&gt;walk back to seat

&gt;put hands behind head

&gt;Bertha sits in shock for a bit

&gt;probably the first time anyone's actually gotten in her face

&gt;starts wobbling

&gt;making weird rodent noises

&gt;like rats being stepped on in a trash bag

&gt;is....is it crying?

&gt;oh

&gt;oh shit

&gt;look back and forth at bros

&gt;whatdidido.ohgod

&gt;fuck it

&gt;stand my ground

&gt;pretend to be cool

&gt;look directly at principal

&gt;Are we done here? Because I am.

&gt;bros look on in shock

&gt;ohgodohgodohgodwhatdidijustsayohgodohgod

&gt;JUSTGOWITHIT

&gt;stand up out of chair

&gt;give crying Bertha the most evil

&gt;she's still visibly shaken and whimpering

&gt;manage to keep rage under wraps just enough for a semblance of civil speech

&gt;Don't ever talk to me again. I'm done with you.

&gt;bros tentatively get up with me

&gt;leave

And that's the end. The principal couldn't get me in trouble because technically I hadn't done anything wrong. Bertha and her family were furious
Of course I have dozens of other stories about Bertha and her shittiness- but most of them are just her being a bad person

Epilogue:

&gt;be me a year later

&gt;all is well

&gt;Skinnybro says he saw Bertha at school

&gt;whole nasty family visiting old friends I guess

&gt;spot her in cafeteria

&gt;no friends

&gt;probably gained like 30lbs since I saw her last

&gt;sitting alone eating mcbeetus

&gt;sees me looking at her

&gt;struggles to get out of chair

&gt;waddles away at top speed

&gt;too scared to even grab her food

**The Hamspanic Part I**


Medical background here. I will try to keep it simple

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Be me. 20 M. Be working in Intensive Care Unit as a nurse tech (body fluid cleanup specialist/nurses bitch).

On my first day I found out that typically out of the 20 beds in the [ICU](http://i.imgur.com/UXvcIiS.gif)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Be working shitty late night shift. Actually tonight is not too bad since most coworkers are chill bro-nurses who are freaking awesome! Turning out to be a slow night

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Suddenly the channel 4 super-doppler weather radar picks up a high blood pressure system approaching the area.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The US Geological Survey picks up an undiscovered tectonic plate moving across the state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The hospital has just entered...""The Adipocyte Zone.""

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Since it was a slow night the bro-nurses pulled the tv out of the break room and had it in the nurses station watching the Mavericks game.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Senses a disturbance in the force. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dirk Nowitzki shoots a free throw but for some reason it pulls wildly 90 degrees before hitting the basket. WTF?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Overhear chatter on radio of paramedics driving a moving truck to the hospital. Lolwut? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/imgur_9CUtI.gif) Silly paramedics...you’re supposed to use an ambulance. Amiright?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Announcement over the PA system for all able bodied medical staff to descend into the depths of the ER. I had to stay and man the desk while all of the male nurses ran downstairs. The air began to get thick and greasy with the smell of fetid fermented fungal fecal cheese. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In rolls a Hispanic planet we'll call Hamspanic on a [bariatricbed.jpg](http://imgur.com/BZG7rEu) being transported by a dozen burly paramedics and bro-nurses who are red in the face and breathing heavily from pushing Hispanic Planet up to the ICU. Doctor asks which nurse will be taking care of the patient. Look of [nope](http://imgur.com/NLhLtYI) on everyones face. The unlucky nurse was one of my favorite bros

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;According to the paramedic report

Her problem she was admitted to the ER for? (aside from the plethora of obesity related disease).... [drumroll](http://i.imgur.com/6BlEqRv) 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Low oxygen levels and organ damage...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because she won’t wear her CPAP mask...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because it interferes with her constant eating...

Quick and dirty medical rundown:

Low oxygen levels=high blood pressure+high heart rate+highly acidic blood+decreased blood oxygen=damages and enlarges the heart which can lead to congestive heart failure = brain damage from lack of oxygen+damages the kidneys which can lead to total renal failure+5-10 years max on constant hemodialysis before you die (or transplant).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[All our faces](http://imgur.com/0VlmXLv) when we realize patient being admitted because eating is more important than breathing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Heart/lungs/kidneys failing due to lack of oxygen.
Impacted colon because...fuck a fiber rich diet! Etc...

(Another fps coming soon just how much a lack of fiber can fuck...you...up. Google diverticulitis if you can't wait)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go with Don to do the initial patient assessment. Hamspanic is PISSED that she has to wear her CPAP because she is hungry. But thankfully she just sounds  like a muffled Jabba underneath the mask.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beds have built in scales. Push button to weigh patient. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After flashing ""Kill Me Please"" across the screen a few times

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;957 lbs (435 k)

43 lbs short of the weight limit for the biggest hospital beds in existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Leave room. I look at Don. [HFW again](http://imgur.com/ESILMxV)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All of a sudden we hear “Oh booooooyyyyyyyzzzzzz! Come scratch muh kittay!!” 

[Wat](http://imgur.com/zm1nctA)?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Go into her room and she had shit herself. Earlier the Doctor had given her elephant laxatives because she was so impacted (colon packed full of tons and tons of dried out hardened shit from fast food) and hadn’t crapped in months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Helped nurse clean her up. It took 4 people to roll her over and hold her legs up to clean the greasy green goodness from each fold. Each time it took 45 minutes because you had to clean out all of the folds. She would giggle the entire time and make sexual passes at all of the male staff

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One hour later over the intercom “Come skratch muh kittay boyz!” she had done it again. She was supposed to call us and we would put a bedpan under her to help contain it. She loved being cleaned up. After the 5th time while the nurse was cleaning out her cavernous shit filled vag we heard her say “That’s it

Don't forget to check out [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ikg16/chubs_mcnasty_the_roommate_from_hamplanet_hell/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1il5ht/chubs_mcnasty_the_roommate_from_hamplanet_hell/) 

So after the first few days of living with the Barfield monstrosity, strange things went missing, like entire bottles of chocolate syrup or jars of mayonnaise. Plates and cups followed the condiments; it was like everything we had left in our kitchen was growing legs and walking away. 

We had already learned that nothing edible was safe in our house

Ok, and I were students with jobs, so we were almost never home. We got up early, packed lunches, and didn’t get home until late. Barfield would still be asleep when we left in the morning and when we got home, she’d be sitting on her couch (it would never be our couch again), sagging all the way to the floor

Since we had abandoned the kitchen for storage, bulging out all over the place, and I have no idea how she tetris-ed everything in there. I assume it’s the same way she fit into the shower… some sort of whale magic. It was from this endless stash that she fed her ravening hunger, refilling it two or three times a week. She would take a cab for the 15 minute walk to the grocery store. 

A few weeks into the school year, but they have four stomachs. I’m pretty sure she just had one, although it was certainly industrial-size. 

The first day I stayed home

&gt; stumble out with blanket wrapped around me and Gatorade from my secure room fridge

&gt; stop 

&gt; blink repeatedly

&gt; am I hallucinating?

&gt; no

&gt; she is lying on the couch

&gt; eating some sort of shepherd’s pie

&gt; but she’s lying down

&gt; the microwave container is sitting on the ground

&gt; she’s lying on her side on the couch with her face at the edge

&gt; spooning food from the dish to her mouth

&gt; this is the laziest thing  I have ever seen

That’s right. That hamplanet was so lazy

&gt; hear Barfield head for the bathroom

&gt; she’ll be in there for at least half an hour

&gt; I go out to survey the damage 

&gt; dish is still on the floor

&gt; spoon is also on the floor

&gt; trail of gravy up the side of the couch

&gt; like the trail of slime a snail might leave after it had become escargot

&gt; and she just left it there 

&gt; I don’t… I can’t… you poor couch. You poor

&gt; retreat to my room again, goo off the couch

&gt; fall asleep

&gt; wake up

&gt; ok

&gt; walk out to confront her

&gt; and stop again… she’s doing it again

&gt; she has another shepherd’s pie and she’s eating it off the ground

&gt; reevaluate my plan

&gt; nope

&gt; “Barfield

&gt; “I don’t really feel like going today. I’m pretty tired.”

&gt; “And that’s why you’re eating off the floor?”

&gt; “Yeah

&gt; as if this is somehow different from every moment of every day

&gt; “Ok

&gt; “Stop being such a bitch. You’re home sick

&gt; “Yeah. I have swine flu. Swine flu is a disease. Being swine is not. You’d better clean that shit up

&gt; “I said I’d clean it up and I will. God. Go back to bed.” 

And I did. I went to bed and fell asleep and didn’t wake up until the middle of the night. I wandered out to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and learned what Barfield mean by “cleaning up.” She meant that she would dump it all in the sink. Trash and all. Nothing was rinsed, pots, and pans, all caked in grime and piled in the sink. It reeked. I know that I had done dishes just a couple of days before and Skinny and Cranky were just as diligent about keeping the kitchen clean as I was. That was, at most, two days’ worth of dishes. I couldn’t even get to the tap. 

&gt; wake up the next day

&gt; walk out to the living room

&gt; “Go clean the dishes.”

&gt; no preamble

&gt; “I’ll get to them.” 

&gt; “Yes, before you go to class.”

&gt; “I’m not going to class

&gt; “Again? Didn’t you stay home yesterday?”

&gt; “I’m still just really tired.”

&gt; “Ok, as is, and put it in your bed.”

&gt; “If you fucking touch my bed I will throw you out the window.” 

This actually stopped me for a minute. She might have been capable of doing that. Either way, so we just cleaned up the mess. The swine flu eventually passed (after Skinny caught it) and normal schedules resumed, so none of us were ever home. 

I can hear everyone cringing at our beta-ness; I don’t know why we put up with this for as long as we did. Every time, someone else had to. I don’t know if we were just too busy to deal with it or if none of us wanted a fight, but we kept cleaning up. 

While my roommates coped by spending less and less time at home and locking themselves in their rooms when they had to be there

After a particularly nasty incident involving some milk and other things that really can’t be left out

&gt; calmly drop my bag in my room

&gt; Barfield is in the living room; how can I get past her without her stopping me?

&gt; I know

&gt; grab a trash bag

&gt; push the mountain of shit from our sink into the trashbag

&gt; it’s wet and rotten and soggy and it smells appalling
&gt; casually stroll past the living room with this steaming bag of putrid filth

&gt; duck into her room

&gt; upend the bag on her bed

&gt; look around and realize she might actually not be able to tell that anything had happened…

Everyone here knows about the strong correlation between hamplanets and sloppiness and Barfield was no exception. For every container, there were two or three more in her room. It was EVERYWHERE. I can’t believe she could sleep in there – I had to fight not to lose my lunch. 

I fled back to the safety of my room where I stripped off all of my tainted clothing, because in my head that beast wouldn’t come after me in the shower. Finally, the hot water gave out and I had step back out and face what I had done. 

But the warpig sat there

I thought that perhaps I had won. 

The next weekend, so no problems there. Then I got to Barfield. 

&gt; “What do you mean

&gt; “The floor will be wet. If you walk on it

&gt; “But what if I get hungry?”

&gt; ha. if.

&gt; “That’s why I’m warning you now. Grab what you want and get out of my way so I can clean up the train wreck you’ve made of our kitchen.”

&gt; “Listen

By a few things, she left all the dishes and trash she used to make them. Oh, and did I mention I’m extremely allergic to peanuts?

&gt; oven beeps

&gt; pizza’s done

&gt; thunderous crashing 

&gt; she’s coming for her pizza

&gt; Barfield waddles in

&gt; “Did you mess with my pizza?”

&gt; “Why the fuck would I touch your pizza? Take it and get out.”

&gt; Barfield puts on an oven mitt

&gt; cooling is for anorexics

Thankfully, I decided I was going to bake a pie in my beautiful clean kitchen. So I headed off to the grocery store (about a 15 minute walk each way) to get what I needed. About an hour later, I came home with the makings of a glorious pie. 

&gt; walk into kitchen

&gt; whatthefuckisthat

&gt; seriously

&gt; what is that

&gt; on my floor

&gt; it looks like… beans? Sour cream? Cheese? Salsa?

&gt; somebody made nachos

&gt; from the number of cans and jars sitting around

&gt; it looks like she just grabbed a fistful and chucked it at the floor that I’ve just cleaned

&gt; it looked purposeful

&gt; but why would she waste food like that? 

&gt; head for my room to stash my groceries in there until I can deal with this travesty

&gt; what. the. fuck. 

&gt; my room is open

&gt; my lock is broken

&gt; my fridge is… empty

&gt; all my food is gone – she turned it into nachos

&gt; bitch

Apparently Barfield had been waiting for her moment to strike. I should have known she would never let the dishes in her bed go. She juggernauted through my door like a gorilla and gobbled up my food. I imagine that’s why she didn’t mind wasting some by throwing it on the floor. Then she went and hid in her room to wait for me to find her little surprise. 

&gt; storm back to the kitchen

&gt; grab a paper towel

&gt; scoop up as much of this crap as I can hold

&gt; storm to Barfield’s lair

&gt; knock knock

&gt; Barfield doesn’t lock her door because no one ever wants to go in there

&gt; I open it and she’s sitting on her bed

&gt; that’s right

&gt; “You broke into my room.”

&gt; “I’m starving and you said I couldn’t go in the kitchen.”

&gt; “It’s pretty obvious that you were in the kitchen

&gt; show her the paper towel full of floor nacho

&gt; “That’s not mine.”

&gt; “Fuck you.”

&gt; sitting there eating a bowl full of what I just found on the floor

&gt; I know perfectly well that it’s yours

&gt; and I know that it was deliberate

&gt; so I’m over trying to be friendly and make this work

&gt; I wind up 

&gt; and I hurl the nacho grenade

&gt; full force

&gt; it’s all over her, everywhere

&gt; and she’s bellowing with rage

&gt; “I will fucking sue you. I will make sure you go to fucking jail.”

&gt; “Terrific. You testify to the courtroom about that time you were eating a fucking mixing bowl full of nachos after you already killed a couple of sandwiches and a frozen pizza. They’ll have a lot of sympathy for you.” 

&gt; “Don’t you ever come near me again.” 

&gt; “Don’t you ever leave a mess like that again. If you don’t clean up after your filthy

I went back to the kitchen, did she have it coming. I’ve never been so angry. I had never threatened to hurt anyone before and I never have since, but she was just so overwhelmingly and aggressively foul. I couldn’t take it. And apparently, she was just worried enough that I might actually act on my baser impulses. 

Stay tuned for the Barfield Adventures finale! 

TL;DR: Barfield achieves new lows and I lose my cool.

I was tired and hungry after skipping lunch and a full day of walking/standing in my high heels.  I really didn't look forward to cooking

I walk in the restaurant and it's tiny!  There are only about 15 tables and the only other features are a door to the kitchen and an ordering counter.  This restaurant is the kind where it's all either takeout or eat from takeout containers at the provided tables, but the third was extremely large.  The large lady was sitting in a chair with her legs splayed wide to accommodate her belly/fupa.  Her thighs had a greater circumference than the largest part of my body, and I'm not a skinny-Minney.  Since she was sitting, I couldn't really gauge her stats, but think [this but more pear shaped](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-29064-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.UfU42W3lfms).

I assume that the lady at the counter is ordering for the whole table as they're talking about their orders and she keeps turning to discuss the menu.  The lady ordering keeps looking at me and smirking, I find those types annoying but they aren't going to ruin my day or make me feel self-conscious.

The lady who was ordering finally pays (seriously, 90 seconds for the whole transaction and I had never even been to this place before).  I start playing on my phone to pass the time, but since it's a very small restaurant I realize that those women have become even louder.  I look up to see what all the fuss is about, and it's the really fat woman practically shouting her order to the cashier while still seated at the table.  I realize that they've been snickering because *they think I cut in line*.  The lady sitting in a chair 8 feet from the counter thinks she was the next in line...  And, I realize that the 5 minutes of ordering that I suffered through wasn't food for the whole table, but food for one [not so large but probably will be soon] person.  I ended up eating half my food that night and half the next because they were very generous portions.

Background: i live in Australia

&gt;walk into Foodland to purchase ingredients for delicious burritos

&gt;happen to walk in just behind HAT and her 2 planetoid children 

&gt;just inside the door they stop suddenly

&gt;not paying too much attention i accidentally slam (i walk really fast) into one of her children

&gt;its like hitting a greasy soft unmoveable wall

Sorry for the break in the story but i am assuming these are the scooters everyone talks about in FPS's about Walmart and other stores in America and a few other countries


&gt;I stop trying to get in to the store and start listening because i realise one of these fat person stories i read about everyday might actually be happening in front of my eyes

&gt;13 year old kid fresh from the end of school manning the desk

&gt;""Excuse me but where do you keep your mobility scooters?""

&gt;His face is all kinds of wat

&gt;""i need one for my bad knees so if they are all being used you need to call one back for me right now!""

&gt;his face is still wat

&gt;finally registers what she is saying

&gt;""sorry ma'am i dont think we have mobility scooters""

&gt;WHAT! WHAT KIND OF STORE DOES NOT HAVE ANY SCOOTERS!?!? I JUST CAME OFF A PLANE ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA WITH MY 2 KIDS EXPECTING A NICE RELAXING HOLIDAY AND THE FIRST TIME I TRY TO BUY SOME FOOD THE STORE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SCOOTERS!

&gt;at this point a manager has come to save the poor kid from this ordeal

&gt;says something to her which i dont catch but it seemed to calm her down abit

&gt;""so you really dont have any scooters?""

&gt;""no sorry Ma'am""

&gt;""you know you really ought to look into getting some, i will have to go to the place i saw down the street i bet they have scooters.""

&gt;she waddles out of the store

&gt;i get ingredients

&gt;about 10 minutes after she left the store i pass her on the other side of the street

&gt;i realise she doesnt have a car

&gt;she is walking (very slowly) to the other place down the street

&gt;the other place is a good 2kms away from the first store

&gt;At our newly opened cupcake shop. Wife is running the front end

&gt;Second week of running new business

&gt;Be standing in a corner

&gt;Suddenly my bolts and screws start vibrating off the tabletop. 

&gt;Entire store shudders. I assume a storm is starting

&gt;Enter the hamily

&gt;Mommy ham comes in first. Easily 350lbs+ wearing denim short shorts

&gt;Ham Daddy comes in, because it's like 5:30pm. He's wheezing like a malfunctioning chainsaw. His face is red, pockmarked and dripping with sweat.

&gt;Ham son (henceforth referred to as fatty ding dongs, except instead of being a human shaped Batman, he's a bowling ball shaped one. He's probably about 7 years old.

&gt;StickSon comes in. He's maybe 12 years old. He's dressed in generic kid clothes. Pikachu shirt, and as soon as he gets in, he uses it to start examining a decoration on the shop's wallpaper.

&gt;Ham daughter comes in. She's 16 and gunning for Ham Mommy's position as largest thing in the solar system. She looks like a younger clone of ham mommy.

&gt;Ham mommy asks questions about each of the 18 kinds of cupcakes the store offers. Most of the questions are ""What kind is this?"", but my wife handles it nicely, because honestly answering the same question over and over, even when the info is clearly displayed is just part of this industry.

&gt;Ham Mommy picks two dozen cupcakes. My wife pulls them out of the display and boxes them. Turns out that these cupcakes are JUST for Ham Mommy.

&gt;Ham Daddy steps up the the plate and asks EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTIONS about everything, boxes them and rings them up. He wants specific ones of each kind, so like 15 minutes is spent just in him deciding stuff like that he wants the 3rd Strawberry Mojito cupcake from the top.

&gt;Ham Daughter picks a dozen without asking any questions. All she wants is plain chocolate. Wife takes them out of the case and boxes them.

&gt;FDD starts on his arduous journey to pick a dozen cupcakes

&gt;Ham Mommy calls out to StickSon ""Whaddayawawnt?"". StickSon replies ""Do they have Chocolate milk?"" I start ""Sure do you..."" Ham mommy interrupts ""doya have chocolate melk?"". ""Sure

&gt;Wife rings up their bill. Cupcakes are $4 ea, that's like $300. Wife and I are the happiest Jews in Jew town.

&gt;Ham mommy digs around in her purse and then whips out an EBT card. Ham offers it to wife.

&gt;""Ma'am, so does time and space. 

&gt; Then came the ham war-cry

&gt;""YOU HAFTA TAKE IT THAT'S THE LAW!!""

&gt;""No ma'am

&gt;""YOU HAFTA TAKE IT IT'S ILLEGAL NOT TO!!!""

&gt;""Ma'am

&gt;""THEY'RE ON THE WAY""..... good.

&gt;Police cruiser actually shows up. Cop comes in and wants to know what's going on. I explain situation to the cops. HamMommy goes on another rant about how not accepting EBT is illegal. Cop pretty much laughs at her and tells her to GTFO

She was damn well aware of the rule. Phones OFF all weekend.

&gt; We get home to see her car in the driveway. Her car is there but she isn’t and my front door is open. Remembering that a few friends know where I hide my spare key *for emergencies only* I figure this must be it and switch into rage-mode.

&gt; “GhasFa

There will be no tee-hees in this story. Only snort-laughs which she actually does.

&gt; “none of you were answering my calls so I came home to make sure you got home. Oh

&gt; “How did you know where the key was hidden?” to which she replied “The door was open

My door is never open. I lock it as soon as I get home and it locks after I leave. It’s magic! (It’s actually one of those dead-bolts that lock as soon as you close it. Tumbler for a handle on the inside

&gt; “Bullshit. Get the fuck out of my house!”

&gt; After kicking her out

&gt; I check outside my house and she was still in my driveway... I run out and stop her from leaving. I ask her how long she was at the house for. She answers “Oh

&gt; “Are you kidding me? My fridge is EMPTY. It WAS full but it isn’t anymore. What the fuck? You want to tell me again how long you were here for?”

&gt; “I came here yesterday after camping and was waiting for you. I wanted to apologize for leaving your window open.”

&gt; “So you come over here

&gt; “Well....” This is where she stuttered

When someone pisses me off as bad as she did or does a completely illogical thing

&gt; I go back in the house and that’s the end of my weekend.

&gt; I take my car to get it detailed on Monday and it ends up costing me over $300 bones. That plus food on the weekend and food from my house

&gt; A week goes by and my lovely gf calls her up and asks her if she got it. GhasFa says “No”. I’ve sent it to her three email accounts; she should have gotten it by now. Obviously has. Whatever. I’m good friends with her brother so I send it to him

&gt; Fast forward yet another week. Haven’t heard anything. I talk to her brother about it again and ask him why it’s taking her so long to even talk to one of us about it. He says that she said she did. I tell him that she hasn’t yet and HE goes into rage-mode and spills everything:

&gt; Over the past week

Back-story

&gt; FF two more weeks and I finally get a cheque in the mail. We still make fun of it a year later. GhasFa is still around but avoids all eye-contact with me because she knows I’ll eye-stab her or make her spontaneously combust.

So the Whale and Jonah have been dating at this point for perhaps two weeks. I haven't caught sight of this elusive boyfriend in the flesh yet

L is a woman in her 50s who holds down two jobs and is just a sweetheart in general.

A is another older lady

The day finally comes when I see this hunk of man meat in the flesh. He's maybe 6 ft (about 182 cm) and skinny as a fucking rail. I can't even begin to guess his weight.

“Fuck off trailer trash” she garbbles at me. She pulls a phone out of the crevice of cleavage and glares at me. Crumbs fall everywhere. YUCK. I glance back at the kids. They’ve grown quiet. They sense a disturbance in suburbia.

“You’re pitiful” I say evenly to the beast. She has her phone out and claims to be recording me and how I’m ashamed of my body and taking it out on her. WUT.

I work at a medium size (about 60 people) company, gets along and believes in our company. I'm the IT guy, and almost always have no complaints. Users are smart, honest about fucking their shit up, and don't bullshit me.

Hamtony is a... I don't really know the specs. I'd say 5'8, but nobody on his teams seems to get along with him. I always just chalked it up to the fact that he has the fat person fermenting yeast smell, though his isn't that bad compared to crazy people I've seen on the bus system.

Today when I got into work the Fire Alarm started blaring almost immediately. The hallway was filed with light smoke and a super foul smell

Firefighters are just next door and the fire is out in maybe ten minutes. Turned out Hamthony's computer had caught fire

The reason for the fire? Well, which mostly meant he would buy those ten lb packs of assorted candy on Amazon, fill the bowl, and eat it at about a ten pieces in, one piece shared ratio.

Coworker asked him to hide it for a week since he was trying to watch his weight

By apparently opening his computer

It managed to run fine the first day he did this

Result: FWOOSH.

When Hamthony came in, and used it as a turning point from what I can tell. I still don't talk to him now, but his candy bowl is now a fruit bowl, and I have seen him biking to and from the gym on his lunch break.

Open on an airport gate area.  

In one row of seats close to the walkway, and a suit-wearing man who is deeply fascinated by something on his Blackberry.

Two new passengers, with a large purse slung over her shoulder and a bag of fast food in one hand. but she would not look out of place at a typical all-you-can-eat buffet line.  

Her husband

His slacks are taut and shiny over thighs which are at least twice the diameter of a typical human waist.  These trousers are held up over his ballooning stomach by suspenders that could easily serve for tying down a zeppelin.  His shirt is damp with perspiration

""Can you get up?"" the zeppelin-man asks brusquely. 

The students look up in confusion.  There are many other seats empty in this gate area. 

""Can you get up *please*?"" he repeats

Seeing the man's size

""Good god

A second student stands

The woman raises her eyebrows at the remaining two students and purses her lips expectantly. 

Oh.  They want *all* the seats. 

""Seriously?"" asks one of the students,"" says another.  ""There are plenty more seats,"" she adds pointedly.  

The students get up and move to another row. 

Mr. Zeppelin sits down across two of the seats with satisfaction, and produces something greasy from the fast food bag so that they can replenish the calories they expended on this helpful etiquette lesson.

**doinkdoink**

Some time has passed

The businessman's phone rings.  He answers it

The businessman returns.  Mrs. Zeppelin pretends not to notice him.  

""Excuse me

""Sorry, apparently pretending that he hadn't been sitting there two minutes before.

Mr. and Mrs. Zeppelin could not quite manage to cut the line in front of a passenger in a wheelchair

The Zeppelins make their way about half way down the plane, and he must clasp his hands on top of his stomach to hold his arms in enough so that others can get past him to the rear of the aircraft.  

As fortune would have it

Mr. Zeppelin brightens when his seatmates arrive. 

""Oh good, either. 

Little Mama replies, which is why she booked the tot his own seat.  

Mr. Zeppelin is not pleased.  ""You're small

Little Mama stands firm

Mr. Zeppelin mutters unhappily but knows that he is beaten...for now.

**doinkdoink**

Suddenly

Little Mama congratulates him for being such a big boy and asks Mr. Zeppelin to let them out so they can visit the bathroom. 

Mr. Zeppelin is annoyed. ""You should really put a diaper on 'em when you're going to be on a flight

Little Mama bites her tongue and escorts Tot to the lavatory.  She is the parent of a small child

However, she fails to notice that Mr. Zeppelin has put up the armrest between his seat and Tot's middle seat.  
 
When Mr. Zeppelin sits back down

""Sorry sir

Mr. Zeppelin cannot completely hide a smug smile as he replies

Mothers have been known to lift cars off their trapped children

""Guess it's stuck

Defeated

Tot is squirming and starting to whine.

&gt;StrongBro and GirlBro are going out. Me and BetaBro are best friends.

&gt;We're all close buddies 'cept for Annie the Orphan.

&gt;Was actually abandoned by her mother for another man. 

&gt;Father died in jail. 

&gt;Grandparents be raising her.

&gt;Has red curly hair and freckles. Would be nice if she was like the character Annie. 

&gt;Nope.jpg

&gt;Fat as fuck and mean-spirited. Is 5'2 and around 280 pounds.

&gt;[Looks kinda like this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-26282-body-shape.htm?StartAt=3#.UZ-KurXVDzw).

&gt;Actually tries to imitate the character

&gt;The dog she begged her grandparent's to buy died because she fed him chocolate. 

&gt;Thinks it was their fault it died.

&gt;People feel sorry for her (especially teachers)

&gt;Is now the most selfish woman you will ever meet.

&gt;She like's Strongbro because muscles and deep-chocolate voice. Always trying to flirt with him even though she knows GirlBro is his girlfriend.

&gt;Always acts nasty to GirlBro because of this.

&gt;Tagging along because beta-as-fuck friend can't say no to her.

&gt;She's in the middle of the backseat

&gt;Strongbro is the driver and GirlBro's in the passenger seat

&gt;Annie's eating a family-sized bag of Lay's and guzzling Bud Light cans she brought in her purse. 

&gt;Wearing too much perfume in an attempt to win him over by smell.

&gt;Wearing too much makeup in an attempt to win him over by sight.

&gt;It'sNotVeryEffective.png

&gt;We see a small fair going on in front of a mall. 

&gt;Annie demands to go because it has a ferris wheel.

&gt;Bitchyou'dbreakthatshit.bmp

&gt;Whatever

&gt;When we pile out

&gt;Girlbro's new jean's gets a new tear from the concrete ground.

&gt;Doesn't even say sorry.

&gt;""Gee whiskers

&gt;My jimmies are rearin' their heads and sniffin' the air.

&gt;We play some of the crappy fair games.

&gt;Strongbro wins at the [Strongman Game](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/camplejeuneglobe.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/3e/93e003ee-c122-11e1-b595-001a4bcf887a/4fec57ad2cfaf.image.jpg). Give's huge teddy bear prize to GirlBro.

&gt;Annie snatches the bear mid-way.

&gt;""THANK you SO MUCH StrongBro! This will look great in my room~"" She winks at him and makes a kissy face.

&gt;GirlBro is too startled to say anything back.

&gt;StrongBro grits his teeth and stays silent.

&gt;They don't take back the bear because they want to keep the night happy.

&gt;My jimmies are packing up and ready to move.

&gt;We arrive to the ferris wheel. It's a small two-seater gondola.

&gt;Obviously

&gt;Annie's too big for another person to fit in it.

&gt;Has to ride it alone.

&gt;Annie doesn't like this.

&gt;Not one bit.

&gt;She blocks their path from entering the ride.

&gt;She screams at GirlBro for stealing her man.

&gt;Calls her a dirty little whore that doesn't have any womanly features a guy wants.

&gt;Cries at StrongBro for dating a skinny

&gt;Starts going into a fat discrimination rant about how she can't be seated with her soul-mate.

&gt;OhGodSheHasBeenReadingHAES.gif

&gt;My jimmies are movin' about and gonna run the hell out.

&gt;As she's moving back to display all of her glorious flab

&gt;She trips and actually topples over the small fencing.

&gt;Literally does a small flip in the air.

&gt;Lands on her belly

&gt;We're all speechless for a moment

&gt;We're trying to rouse her from her daze and check for any broken bones.

&gt;Learn a cruel lesson in the mechanics of the friendzone. Realize that she only wants to talk to me when she wants something (usually some form of support after the 10th not-me guy in a row has dumped her after getting to wrestle naked with her), she acts like I'm made of terribly stinky, radioactive cheese while I bend over backwards and buy her stuff.

&gt;Decide to stop wasting effort on a relationship where I'll be spending boyfriend levels of money

&gt;Next year, develop a minor bodybuilding hobby. Everyone at this school lives in the library so that isn't weird anymore. Acquire serious girlfriend, and full ride to college. Be happy.

&gt;In the time since I last saw her, Hamanda.

&gt;Notice that her entire facebook is full of spam about how men like ""real"" women. ""Bones are for dogs. Meat is for men"" crap like that. Most of it is done in those stupid monochromatic postcard things of an irrelevant stock image. Everything else is just drunkposting

Want to come over and party?"" me, being confused as to how she got my number, and shocked at how she sounds over the phone, I only manage to say ""Nope"". ""Mmmmn okay, we can do this later, yeeeeah"". Sounds like she's masturbating. She hangs up.

&gt;Wat?

&gt;""What?"" ""Wanna party?"" ""Nope"" she is audibly shaken ""O-okay.... Maybe next time...."". I start to say ""Stop calling me"" but she hangs up before I get the full sentence out. I save her number as ""DO NOT ANSWER""

&gt;Next day

&gt;""Hey anon. Wanna come party?"". This time it isn't the masturbation-y voice. It's a kind of pissed off

&gt;""Hamanda, is because you've either run out of other options, or you want me to waste money on you again."" 

&gt;""FUCK YOU HOW DARE YOU FUCKING JUDGE ME!! I FUCKING HATE YOU!!!"" click. She hangs up on me.

**Thin privilege posts are only for Thin Privilege Thursdays.**

Also

* **Harassing and attacking other members will not be tolerated.** This includes reaming a poster out because they're fat. Our fat posters are aware of themselves and 99% of them are actually using the advice and support of this sub to lose their weight and shreds of logic they may be clinging to.

**Suggestion box time**

Lastly, and a big list of suggestions. We won't be able to make *everyone* happy but it's good to get some feedback. 

This is also where I ask you to **stop making [meta] posts about the formatting of FPSs.** Some people like greentext, don't put a million GIFs in your story, that's annoying to everyone). 

I could go on and on about the little things that have been complained about, some don't like them. Because of this, **it's literally impossible to enforce a formatting that will make everyone happy.**

Basically, I'll recite the other stories about her. 

This is the story of how I escaped her house

&gt; Be me, I've gained about 5-10 kilos. Not being able to walk will do that. 

&gt; One day

&gt; Now she's big. [Like 5'4""

&gt; She doesn't fit into our school uniform

&gt; She invites me round. Try to be polite

&gt; She's talking about her adorable new puppy

&gt; After school

&gt; Realise that's her 3rd sandwich of the day. She had 2 at lunch plus other stuff. 

&gt; Her mum picks us up. 

&gt; MFW she's normal sized. 

&gt; Hamily annonces the entire time that she's hungry. Watch as mum has to placate her as if she's a child.

&gt; We get to her house. Hamily heads straight to the kitchen. 

&gt; Pulls out jumbo chips. Eats entire packet over the course of the next hour. 

&gt; Asks if I want any. ""Nothanks"". 

&gt; ""You should eat more

My lunches are not small. Croissant, so lack of exercise means I've put on 10+ lbs. 

&gt; ""I just love food! I can't understand why you don't""

&gt; Stay silent. Seething. I love food, super healthy with quinoa and shit.

The weirdest thing about this girl is, she's called others fat, and I've tried to point out how large she is. She flat out doesn't accept it. She is so large, they're going to have to order in her uniform and she doesn't fucking get it. 

&gt; Hamily's mum and dad come in. ""Oh hi hamily

&gt; Hamily ""No. TeeHee""

&gt; Literally laughs at the suggestion of exercise.

&gt; Returns to fridge. Makes another sandwich (her fourth for the day

&gt; Turns out her parents training for the marathon. Both fit. Her older sister is a dance teacher. Fit. 

&gt;  Wat.

&gt; Ask what exercise she does. ""OH I do a bit of hockey

I was in PE with her

&gt; ""OH knee problems! Me too

&gt; ""It hurts sometimes.""

&gt; Wat. ""Can't be that bad. Do you see a physio?""

&gt; ""No it's not bad enough to see someone. Anyway like you'd know about knee pain"" 

&gt; MFW I realise she is too thick to connect that I've had knee surgery. 

This is making me too mad. So much fat logic. Decide to discuss something else.

Walk into her room. It is THE MOST childish room I have ever seen in my life, like last months), everything was pink.

&gt; She spends 20 minutes discussing her beanie babies. TeeHee-ing constantly. 

&gt; Ask her if she doesn't think it's a bit infantile. Doesn't know what the word means. 

&gt; Dog comes in

&gt; It's adorable!! Super sweet

Or so I thought. 

&gt; Dog rolls over onto back

&gt; Hamily starts TeeHeeing

&gt; I think she's going to scratch her tummy. 

&gt; Sowrong.jpeg

&gt; She reaches out her fat pinky.

&gt; And puts it in the dogs vagina. 

VOMIT.mp4

&gt; Starts masturbating off the dog. 

&gt; ""She loves it!"" Tee Hee. 

Yes. ***Actually starts giggling.*** 

I back away. 

&gt; ""Should you really be doing that!?!""

&gt; ""Oh it's totally fine

&gt; ""Please stop""

&gt; ""why?""

&gt; ""Just do.""

&gt; ""Fine... Want more food?""

This girls house is an hours drive from mine. Noescape.gif

&gt; Hamily walks back into the kitchen

I can't stand it anymore. Call mum to come and pick me up. 

&gt; She invites me to a sleepover. ""We can share a bed! It'll be fun!""

Ohgod.png

&gt; Hamily's mum arrives back from the run. ""oh yes please stay! Hamily has a hard time making friends

&gt; Bullshit story about little sister being sick.

&gt; Have to wait awkwardly for an hour for my mum to come. 

&gt; See lunch prep for the next morning. So much food - 6 sandwiches with various fillings, fruit, lollies, chocolate biscuits. Takes 2 lunch boxes to fit it in. She's only at school 6 hours - why does she need so much?!?!

&gt; Finally escape. Never nice to hamily again. Tell almost noone the story for years - don't want to think about it ever again. Just stop talking to her. 

&gt; 2 months later I hear she's spreading rumours about how much of a bitch I am. 

&gt; Just means more people stop talking to her.

&gt;we stay for about another 2 hours as Kirby found another ""curvy girl"" to talk to about ""muh curves"" ""real women"" and how hot army bro is

&gt;everyone but my husband and Army Bro are feeling good at this point because they are the DD's

&gt;she suddenly remembers she has to go to the grocery before we leave the bar

&gt;husband refuses

&gt;she begs to go

&gt;[hfw] (http://i.imgur.com/KEWWu.gif)

&gt;she's too drunk to argue

&gt;we get to Kirbys house and we realize someone accidentally grabbed her keys and she has to hang out at our house until army bro and the crew get home

&gt;about 20 minutes later

&gt;we are hanging on the back porch and watch as she waddles down the road and goes through the back gate

&gt;she starts undressing

&gt;NO SHE IS UNDRESSING!!!! AHHHHH!

&gt;Army bro and gang get home just in time to see her stripped to her bra and panties and sit on the side of the hot tub

&gt;husband

&gt;Army bros friend has her keys and they help her out and run in to get her robe

This is the last thing that happened that night that made Army Bro finally lose it

&gt;All the guys help her to her bathroom so she can change into pajamas

&gt;husband comes back home and looks scarred for life

&gt;Army bro and friend come barrelling out of her house as we hear screaming coming from her bedroom window

&gt;Army bro comes running up to the deck where we have the bonfire going and have the beers set out and tells us what happened

&gt;Kirby came out of the bathroom with one boob hanging out claiming that her top was caught on something

&gt;they stood there not knowing what to do

&gt;she said ""just pull the back down and it will fix itself""

&gt;army bro was desperate for her boob to be covered so he reached around to her back to pull the snagged part down

&gt;before he could grab the snagged part of her shirt

&gt;he immediately pulled away and ran into her bathroom and gagged uncontrolably over the toilet

&gt;she turned to our friend and said ""my parents arent home

&gt;that was it for army bro

&gt;He ran into the hall

&gt;If you EVER flirt with me, or so much aS look at me wrong again, I will file a harassment charge and a restraining order, and so will my girlfriend

&gt;If you EVER force me to touch any part of you again I will be forced to file sexual harassment charges on you

&gt;If you even TRY to pull that fake bullshit with that fake facebook account again

&gt;dont look at me

&gt;at this point he ordered her ""drunk ass to get in the bed, he didnt have to ask)

&gt;thats when he said she barreled towards the bed

We will NEVER EVER go out with her again, she can walk to the grocery or call a cab. her mother called to see how things went and we told her what happened, she is beyond livid at her own daughter.

EDIT 1: gifs seem to be working now

EDIT 2: Army bro just checked the mail, to go over in uniform and give her a warning about harassing Army Bro and his girlfriend. [This] (http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-9592-body-shape.htm#img) is a pic of her weight and height, but its not her. I couldn't edit the pic enough.

Now to the main story (I am the protagonist and there are some sad parts to it but I am not going to make any excuses). Also to give more context I was always a academic overachiever (and proud of it) and am good at my job and also I have a pretty above average IQ. (I use these to set higher standards for myself and not to be superior over other people). But below are some stories of how I used these to lie to myself about why I was fat


&gt; Be fat teenager in a third world country (240 lbs/5' 11''/16 years).

&gt; Millions of starving people

&gt; Pilgrims come to my house to admire and worship my generous proportions

&gt; Hide behind academic achievements and high IQ

&gt; Teachers praise my work and ignore my growing gravitational field

&gt; One teacher once asks me point blank - ""why are you so fat?""

&gt; Face burns with shame say THIGH-ROID

&gt; Thyroid - normal

&gt; Angry at teacher and get depressed and go into spiral of working harder in school (somehow prove that honest teacher wrong - fatlogic!!!) and eating more junk food

&gt; Teachers continue to praise my work but ignore my weight problem

I realize now that the teacher who actually asked me about my weight was the one I should have listened to instead of hating. But my fatlogic-addled brain could not understand it then.


&gt; Be object approaching hamschild radius in college (280 lb)

&gt; First crush and puppy love (more like full blown slobbering st. bernard's love)

&gt; Continue usual academic over-achievement and convinced girl will fall head-over-heels for me

&gt; Manufacture courage to ask her out - polite no

&gt; Crushed and rail to friends about fat discrimination.

&gt; One honest friend tries to tell me that maybe my weight makes me unattractive

&gt; Stop helping him with college work and stop talking to him

&gt; Only keep ""friends"" who agree to my fatlogicity and just want me to help with college assignments

No need to say what I did wrong there


&gt; Crossed the ham-horizon an reached full-blown ham-hole status (330 lb)

&gt; Be in grad school, everybody is as good or better than me

&gt; Fully immerse myself in grad-work to maintain my overachievement

&gt; Try dating to improve social life

&gt; Second year of PhD

&gt; More depressed and brother tries to gently say that there is more to life then studying (physical activity and healthy weight for example)

&gt; Start hating brother and stop talking to him

I made up with my brother soon and he stopped talking about my weight to keep peace. This last One is about how FPS helped

More stories [here] (http://www.reddit.com/user/pedrandas/submitted/). 

The Lard sisters are my cousins (Jamhampants

This was a few years ago when our families would drive to the beach together: following each other in separate cars

The drive to the beach was about 4 hours. This was the last time we drove with them

&gt;  be me: 125/5'5""/athletic. 

&gt;  heading off to the beach with the family

&gt;  we load up our bags and head over to the lard sisters house

&gt;  drive is about 40 minutes away

&gt;  make it to their house

&gt;  they just finished their breakfast

&gt;  the sisters waddle out to sit in their car as their parents bring out all of their luggage

&gt; they each carry a tote bag of monstrous size

&gt;  parents and I exit the vehicle to ask if they need any help and say 'good morning'

&gt;  I greet their parents and then head over to their car

&gt;  sisters already munching on junk food from their totes

&gt;  it's barely 6am and they just ate...

&gt;  Anomnomnom lifts her shirt to show me her new bikini

&gt;  finish wiping up vomit on the concrete drive way

&gt;  their mom starts the car and dad finished dragging all of their luggage and packed it up

&gt;  Jamhampants's 2 suitcases wouldn't fit...trip is less than a week long

&gt;  her father asks if she can repack whatever she needs and leave stuff she doesn't

&gt;  tantrum ensues with her usual cursing and brattiness

&gt;  her father asks if she can at least hold onto it in the backseat since the trunk is full

&gt;  nope.jpg

&gt;  her mom ends up holding on to the carry on sized roller suitcase in the passenger's seat....

&gt;  mfw I don't have a fucking face

&gt;  everyone is seated

&gt;  their dad goes around to double check the house is locked up

&gt;  Anomnomnom screams at her ""daddy"" to ""hurry the fuck up""

&gt;  stayclassy.somethingclever

**And so starts the drive**

&gt;  About 10 minutes later

&gt;  the lard sisters want jack in the box

&gt;  pull in to the jack in the crack 

&gt;  my family isn't a lardapalooza so one breakfast was enough for us in an hour

&gt;  we still exit

&gt;  stand in line with the lard sisters

&gt;  ""didn't you guys already eat breakfast?""

&gt;  oh shit...what have I said..

&gt;  J: ""I really didn't eat that much

&gt;  A: ""yea....we don't starve ourselves like you do lol don't fall through the cracks in the sidewalk when we head back outside lol""

At least I can fit through something....

&gt;  hold my tongue

&gt;  they order a shit ton of food and insist we stay at the restaurant until they're done

&gt;  it's almost 7am

&gt;  they finish at 7:45

&gt;  my parents not too pissed

&gt;  I am pissed

&gt;  in the car and on the road at about 8am

&gt;  been out for TWO HOURS already and we're barely leaving their town

&gt;  driving on the highway

&gt;  about an hour later

&gt;  ""nah

&gt;  J: ""ok well we're stopping by BK and my daddy's phone is charging so he can't call. He asked me to text y'all to take the next exit""

&gt;  motherfucker. Are you serious.. It's about just past 9.

&gt;  tell my dad

&gt;  my mom comments: ""they should have just brought a trough for their girls so we don't have to keep stopping all the damn time""

&gt;   lol mom u so funny

&gt;  J gets a large fry and chicken fingers or something of the like and then a chocolate shake AND a sweet tea. I only remember this because she abused the cashier as she was ordering

&gt;  forgot what Anomnomnom got

&gt;  they ask to stay for them to eat

&gt;  parents say no due to traffic 

&gt;  Anomnomnom starts cursing and calling her mom a bitch. Loudly. Some construction workers eating were staring with disgust as they were eating their breakfasts. So fucking embarrassing..

&gt;  Anomnomnom storms off to the car and the other 2 sisters follow

&gt; ontheroadagain.mp3

So we've been out of the house for 3 hours already and are barely denting in the first hour of the actual 4-5 hour drive. It's about 9:40ish in the morning. 

&gt;  an hour and a half later

&gt;  they say they need to stretch their legs

&gt;  ok I guess

&gt;  we pull over at the next rest area

&gt;  dads drive off to fill up on gas while we used the facilities 

&gt;  they head straight for the bathroom with me

&gt;  I kinda hurried in because I really had to go so I wasn't socializing with them on the walk over

&gt;  notice they didn't enter the restroom with me

&gt;  step out of the bathroom after I'm done and the motherfuckers are raping the vending machine

&gt;  ""don't you guys have snacks in the car?""

&gt;  evil dagger eyes once again

&gt;  J: "" no our parents ate them all""

&gt; [Yea...sure..] (http://gifrific.com/jennifer-lawrence-sarcastic-ok-thumbs-up/)

&gt;  it's now 11am. Been up since 5am

&gt;  about 2ish hours left in the trip

&gt;  get back in the car and drive again

&gt;  fucking less than TWENTY MINUTES LATER

&gt;  all of my wat

&gt;  my family and I have been eating the food we brought and it fit in a medium sized cooler you can carry by hand. Not too big. They have a LARGE cooler filled with just snacks for the trip. We carried our big cooler too but that was for the beach so it was empty..

&gt;  so we end up at a Wendy's 

&gt;  my mom asks if we want anything

&gt;  I guess some fries sound good

&gt;  datnaturalcut

&gt;  Stand in line as the beasts order their XL meals

&gt;  I go after them and order just a large fry for each of my family members

&gt;  they have the nerve to make fun of me for eating a lot.............they assumed the fries and coke were all for me. J: "" you should watch what you eat

*I will kill you*

&gt;  I say they're for everyone in my car and point out their meals could feed Africa twice over. 

&gt;  hammies not happy with me 

&gt;  they insist we stay again. Fuck no. I actually say something this time...""we're almost there...""

Not authoritative


&gt;  Parents agree. We go to the car. Their parents agree and the hammies get pissed again having to eat in the car. Anomnomnom cries ""child abuse"" as she always does when her parents are ""unfair""

&gt;  we make it to the beach at 3pm. THREE PM. WE LEFT THE HOUSE AT 5am AND IT'S A 4 HOUR DRIVE

&gt; I've spared ye several ""rest stops"" about every 30 minutes to try and cut this story as short as possible

I figured since I included several other stories about the beach vacations we've taken with them

This Jamhampants and the Lardsisters series will never end. So many stories. Stay tuned.

&gt; KK just points towards Porkplanet and keeps convulsing. 

&gt; Cuteguy see's something. Starts convulsing also. 

&gt; Porkplanet is red in the face. Also

&gt; Cuteguy points. ""The desk... the desk"" goes back into hysterics. 

&gt; [MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com//wp-content/gallery/no/dwight-no.gif) I look and realize the back-board to the desk is split down the middle.

1367436224.0,1di0h8,My first experience with ham-logic,None4GretchenWieners,625,148,263,"Hey guys, but that just means more story calories for you fatties.

This story is my first-ever encounter with fatlogic. Buckle up those jimmies

Be me, 5'8”, 160lbs, working at a local chain grocery store. Not skinny but not fat, legitimately curvy in the right places. I was on the track team and I ran at least 5 miles every day so I was in really good shape.  I was the noob in the store at this point as I had only been there one week. These two mini moons, a man and a woman, obviously a couple, and his wife/girlfriend/whatever was about 5'5” and weighed about the same as him. There were cakes and pies a plenty, I thought all this food was for a party. LOLNOPE. When I politely and casually asked if they were planning a party, I thought she was trolling me but I was trying to be polite as I was nervous that I would get in trouble and lose my job if I showed any skepticism and she complained. So I did what any other nervous kid would do

Over the course of the next three months, pastrami, and roast beef along with 20 2-liters of soda and fourteen pounds of American cheese. This woman had not lied, they really do go through that much cheese in one week. It takes all of my patience and willpower to not gag/vomit as I bag their groceries and listen to their fatlogic about how I'm “too skinny” (bitch I'm not skinny) and I need to eat more so I can gain some curves because men don't like women who look like 10-year-old boys. Umm, last I checked 10-year-old boys don't have large C-cup boobs and plump butts. Whatever though, I mostly just drown them out before my jimmies get too rustled and I say something that will get me fired.

Cut to another few months later, right? Wrong. As I am eating my food, I see the female moon pull a Ziploc bag of cheese out of her purse and put it on the table, trying to hide it from the waitresses. Keep in mind this is a rather traditional Japanese restaurant in style and menu and everyone working there is from Japan and have thick accents. When the moons get their 4 plates of food each, I stop eating watch in horror as these people each take a piece of sushi, place it in the center of a slice of cheese, wrap the cheese around the piece, this isn't even good cheese, I notice that everyone else has noticed what these moons are doing to that poor innocent sushi. Every. Single. Piece. Gets wrapped in cheese before being eaten. The waitresses are obviously horrified but also too polite to say anything to them. After I pay

The next part of the story I didn't witness first-hand, he asked them to please never return to the restaurant as they had completely disrespected him, his employees, his restaurant, and his culture. He and couple of the patrons told me that they had started screaming that he was fat-shaming them and they need their cheese to keep their beetus/thighroids from acting up and all Asian people are skinny pieces of shit that hate white people. I thought they were exaggerating a bit, but no, one guy actually had taken video on his cell phone of the whole ordeal. MFW I have no fucking face. They proceeded to scream that they were going to sue for for discrimination and that they would have “this gook-place” shut down for good. Little did they know one of the sushi chefs had called the police on them. When the police showed, chefs

The fat fucks ended up being perma-banned from the restaurant and the owner got a restraining order against them so they couldn't even try to come back without getting arrested.

I wish this story had a happy ending, I really do. I just can't make this stuff up though, I am not that creative in the slightest. If there's enough interest, I'll post more stories of the hamplanets I met while working there.

TL;DR not being fat makes me a 10-year-old boy and Murican cheese is good for the beetus

I used to work in the bakery department of an enormous grocery store.  I wanted to learn to bake bread

We had many regular customers as big as sofas that would come in and lean against the glass of the dessert case.  It was a convex shatterproof glass cover

They kept me busy cleaning down the display case every twenty minutes or so.  There would be streaks of grease and saliva everywhere they touched the glass with their little piggies.  Why did they have to touch the glass?  HWP people never touched the glass.  Fats always - ALWAYS- had to physically touch the display case

 Also, then they'd fold up the boxes and stash them around the store, and leave without paying for the baked goods. The store busted one such thief, and she told them in no uncertain terms that she saw the turnovers she ate as being a freebie, and that she'd been doing it for years with no problems.  I guess her point was that she was somehow grandfathered into shoplifting so the store couldn't touch her. (?)

So, but you had to see this behavior before you could really judge these unofficial rules.  If there were HWP people in line with the Leaners, we had to ring them all up at the bakery counter.  If no Leaners were present, we could just put a tag on their bakery box and they’d be charged at the register when they paid for their other groceries. Most Leaners would have the cashier throw their empty box away before they rang up their purchases.

On our side of the counter, so she was always one of the closers.  It took me one day to realize why she campaigned for the closing shift.

At the end of the day, kneel down behind the bakery case and stuff a whole six maple logs into her mouth, biting down finally after forcing three quarters of the cluster into her might maw.  

She couldn't talk, instead washing the whole thing down with Pepsi.  She was flushed and damp from the effort of chewing and swallowing this mess, but in a moment, she looked at the ceiling and smiled, the maple frosting covering her face and part of her eyeglasses.  ""Good god DAMN thass better'n sex,"" she said.

I decided to quit after a Leaner woman came in and demanded that we give her some peanut butter brownies for free because we were out of the walnut ones she really wanted.  The girl waiting on her laughed, which was a clear sign she intended to eat them in the store.  The manager had security throw her out. Before the guard showed up to collect her she stuffed all of the brownies in her mouth and refused to admit there had ever BEEN any brownies to begin with.  She had an empty box in her cart, a ring of peanut butter chocolate around her lips and a half dozen witnesses that saw her gobble them down.  She accused us of making fun of her weight and making “lewd and hurtful” remarks.  I put my two weeks in that afternoon.  I’d had enough.

TL/DR: It’s hard to make some fat people happy

&gt;co-worker bro walks in after seeing all the guitars on the floor and not up on wall hangers.

&gt;mom having girl take them all down to play

&gt;Co-worker says not to leave guitars on floor

Keep in mind

&gt;mom can't get big hamhock arm around guitar to play.

&gt;get's frustrated

MFW when she just flopped down a $2500 guitar

&gt;mom flaps noise hole open - ""I need a thin guitar

&gt;co-worker grabs thinnest guitar we have

&gt;mom can't even hold it against her

&gt;keeps slipping off.

&gt;mom yells that we don't have any guitars she can play because all of ours are too big

&gt;daughter can play them all without a problem.

&gt;demands we get thinner guitar from back

&gt;tell her what she sees is what we got.

&gt;starts crying

&gt;mom gets up starts walking out of store.

&gt;tells daughter that she shouldn't play guitar

&gt;MFW

tl:dr - mom is too fat to play guitar.
thin privilege is being able to play a standard size guitar.

EDIT - Update - The girl has still continued to come in for her lesson and bought a pack of strings telling me she is still into playing. Her dad, apologized to the store about her mom's rude behavior and lack of respect for the instruments.

&gt;mom recovering from stroke

&gt;AND HERE COMES HAMPLANET SISTER. 

&gt;Bitch is easily twice my size. And I am not tiny. Was 5'4"" and 180 by the time I left. I lost weight out of sheer stress

&gt;She can't be fucking  bothered to come take care of our mom

&gt;pissed off. Back from hospital putting dad to sleep (taking him off life support). Killed my dad. Not in good mood. 

&gt;had made bunch of healthy stuff for me and mom

&gt;went outside to sit in rain and feel sorry for self

&gt;sister comes out and explains to me that she's always hated me

&gt;everyone should be all about getting money

&gt;also

&gt;? o rly and yet who's here handling all this

&gt;sis huffs and bails back in

&gt;I sit and listen to rain and feel it on me. Still alive. 

about an hour goes by

&gt;come back in. Almost everything gone

&gt;sister has eaten *everything*. Three week's worth of food. THREE WEEKS OF FOOD. What the actual fuck.

&gt;picked up some random platter, I held up platter and just gave sis and her fiance the hairiest eyeball ever and started hissing. Not yelling. Hissing. 

&gt; Fatball sister bails in a huff

&gt;..o rly? How bout flipping some cash my way to make up for all the food you just ate? Which I paid for? Or cleaning up your mess? No? Well

&gt; dad dies

&gt;sister too busy making money

&gt;only me and mom care

&gt;My dad's last words? I hadn't seen him in ten years; he looked up at me

&gt;before I fly back home, will eat garbage otherwise. Told her that if sis comes over and eats it all, I'm flying back and will pound sis into a greasy smear on the floor. Being ex-military and all whereas sis is not. Mom listened, sis never got a crumb of any of it. 

And my sister NEVER visited Dad while he was still able to talk. Prob too busy eating and making money.  

Fuck her. There's more

My sister is a grade-A superlative asshole. She hides it well; but she's greedy, and will stab you in the back in a heartbeat. Who on earth would ever come tell their sister she's a drunk loser after that sister just came home to take care of their half-dead mother, and honored their father's living will? Somehow she saw fit to explain to me what a waste of oxygen loser I am, right after I pulled Dad's plug, and while Mom was still too sick to go to the bathroom by herself. Didn't see Sis around for any of that. She sure let me know what a loser I am a week later though. 

She is cunning enough to know when she can steal all your food, so I cooked enough to fill her freezer, stuf like marinated chicken that I'd grilled and bagged, stuffed the freezer, and then more to fill her fridge. And sister **emptied** both, and left the plates and platters all over the damn house. Because I'm a loser drunk, you see, get out of the blast zone; and she went. 

I'll give Sis credit, THAT is what she says. Her bones, if you circle both of our wrists, are smaller than mine. And my wrist is half the size of hers, but my bones are noticeably bigger. 

I do not weigh 300 pounds. I've altered my diet and have lost 30 pounds in the last year. I know that's not much

Apologies for any typos. I'm drunk. Will post more soon. 

I am so pissed off at her. To this day

EDIT: the dog story is not a FPS story, just megabitch. I have noticed that a lot of FPS stories have several common denominators, and one is complete selfishness. Which this one is. So here's the ""killing dogs"" anecdote. 

""mom came to visit me, thought she was gonna have another stroke, she was all ""I gotta get on a plane now! My dogs!"". Somehow my son calmed everyone down, took him hours though.
I don't get why the fuck you'd completely freak out a woman who nearly died of a stroke 6 months ago like that

Not much fatlogic

I seriously cannot remember ever being this pissed off in my life. Son had to calm me down too. I was online booking a flight for myself so I could go beat the fuck out of this chick. 

Same chick who insulted me by offering to make me her in-house cook and maid

Must piss her off that I did fairly well once I got out of state

Today brings in a story about a matriarch type planet called Paunchpaunch

So normally at The Breadstick Garden, but supposedly it goes as follows:

&gt;be seventeen year old hostess

&gt;bright eyed

&gt;See thin man and children walk in greet.exe

&gt;Uh oh

&gt;Sadly inform man of our no animal policy and tell him his shaved moose will have to wait outside

&gt;World weary man turn his eyes to me

&gt;Informs me this is his wife

&gt;Wonder if we count by heads or by souls

&gt;Decide flesh should be the standard

&gt;I know

At this moment

&gt;Get to table

&gt;Holy shit 

&gt;Dont stare

&gt;What are you doing

&gt;Shut your mouth

&gt;Jesus say something

&gt;""Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" 

&gt;Something else

This was the fattest woman I have ever seen. And I live in Texas. I cant even guess at the weight. Large enough to be in a scooter

&gt;A wild Paunchpaunch appears!

&gt;Blackshirt uses gape!

&gt;Its not very effective!

&gt;""Hi there guys

If theres 8 we gotta pay extra right?

&gt;Uh yes maam

Ones a baby

&gt;look for baby

&gt;wat

&gt;youngest kid there probably 8

&gt;""Er

Paunchpaunch demands to see manager. 

&gt;disgonasuck

My manager explained to me that she had already had this conversation with the hostess

&gt;Return suspiciously to table

&gt;Ready to bolt at slightest provocation

&gt;""Okay guys

&gt;Paunchpaunch will not look at me.

&gt;Whole family looking at Paunchpaunch 

&gt;""We aint payin the extra.""

&gt; ""Maam

&gt;We AINT payin EXTRA!""

&gt;Go get manager

&gt;Explain situation

&gt;He asks if I'll take table with no grat

&gt;FUCK no. 

&gt;He goes to talk to her

&gt;Husband comes up to me. Stares right through me, burdened. 

&gt;Explains to me he is going to just wait in the (nearby) mall.

&gt;My heart. 

&gt;He looks like a molested string bean

&gt;Tell him he can have a table right here with me

&gt;He shakes his head and walks away

&gt;Return to table.

&gt;Paunchpaunch looking smug as fuck.

The rest of the night was quick and quiet. I didnt speak another word except to the children. I didnt time or hold the food. Salad, get out. No tip of course. No grat for seven. No peace from this rustling. Her husband was semi attractive too. And they had 6 kids. He mounted that woman six times. (Or more likely, once and she somehow coaxed another five men onto her as well.)

TL;DR By the power of Muh Muh’s ~~husband~~ handler

Before we start, and for that I apologize. Prioritizing my job and summer classes ahead of your storybeetus cundishuns is inexcusable, selfish, and shaming. For your instantaneous inhalation, I present Part IV of Muh Muh’s Odyssey.

If your gloopcose-deprived brains can recall, had (literal) diarrhea of the mouth, and demanded that no one call for an ambulance. For a lack of a better option, her husband had been called and was presently on his way.

Let me reintroduce the ‘Mart characters, teehee! And, yes, I will be using abbreviations, typing out the names burns too many calories and gets muh beetus in a bundle, so mufuckin’ deal widdit!

Ms. Bitchy Blonde (BB): 4’9 110lbs of platinum-dyed bitchiness. The manager of the 3rd shift grocery department.

Flabby Patty (FP): 6’4 400lbs of useless 3rd shift store manager. 
~~Often~~ Perpetually driving a mobility scooter

Guitar Hero Bro (GHB): 5’9 160lbs of beta awesomeness. Unfortunate soul upon whom Porridge feeds.

Tiff: 5’0 120lbs of DD knockers and quiet niceness. Total QTPie. Ohhhhhh muh god

Sorry

But, after all, so without further ado, on to the conclusion of the Odyssey of Muh Muh!


&gt;Finally clocking in


&gt;Decide to visit GHB in the dairy cooler to discuss the Muh Muh incident as it had unfolded thus far


&gt;Tiff pops her head in and asks if I’d like to help her find Daughtermoon


&gt;Although it tears my soul apart to be on the clock but not actually working


&gt;In no time


&gt;We crouch to talk to DM


&gt;Upon gentle coaxing by Tiff, interspersed with bouts of desperate wheezing


&gt;likeMuhMuhlikedaughter.mustbesoproud


&gt;Just as we’re about to give up (“We’re not getting paid enough for the bullshit, and she shrinks further back into the clothes rack


&gt;DAUGHTERMOON used HIDE ! It’s not very effective …


&gt;Simultaneously


&gt;I see Tiff shudder


&gt;It approaches


&gt;thudthudthud*thudthudthud*THUDTHUDTHUD


&gt;I stand up and turn in time to see a Wildebeetus charging into the store


&gt;The Wildebeetus is moving incredibly fast for its size


&gt;For one hopeful moment, but it was not to be


&gt;With an impressive braking mechanism, through-the-teeth tone:


&gt;“Whurr is she? Whurrs muh fuckin’ bitchofa wife?”


&gt;Seeing the Wildebeetus in such close proximity to the tiny Ms. BB puts him into perspective


&gt;I note immediately that the Wildebeetus is actually a rare and exquisite specimen of the Globular Trashius Beerguttiae variety of hill giant


&gt;I consider how blessed I am to live in an area of the US where these specimens live so I can bask in their majesty


&gt;No… no


&gt;The Wildebeetus certainly was massive


&gt;Oddly, underlying a prodigious beer gut and a single, massive underchin sack complete with a patchy stubble neck beard


&gt;Atop the monstrosity was a perfectly round head


&gt;The Wildebeetus wore a cut off Garth Brooks T-shirt


&gt;Be still my beating ~~heart~~ thighroid!


&gt;Ms. BB, she pointed with a jerky motion over her shoulder


&gt;Wildebeetus walks past Ms. BB without another word


&gt;Muh Muh is sleeping once again (we just let her sit there


&gt;Muh Muh’s incredible number of curves prop her directly upward


&gt;The Wildebeetus only takes a second to take in the wine and vomit-soaked Muh Muh


&gt;”WHUT THE FUCK YEW DOIN’ OUTTA THE HOUSE YOU FAT PIECEO’SHIT!? I HAD TUH DRIVE ALL THE WAY FROM WORK TO COME PICK UP YERR SORRY ASS LOOK WHUT THE FUCK YOU DID YOU CRAZY BITCH!”


&gt;A lesser woman would’ve cried or at least blanched from such vulgar reprobation from her husband, curvy womyn after all!


&gt;Muh Muh counterattacks: “YEW DUN GIT ME MUH MEDICUN SO AH HAD TUH GIT IT MUHSELF! AND I DIN DO NUTHIN


&gt;Note about ten minutes ago she had repeatedly told my manager she doesn't even drink


&gt;Note also Muh Muh is sitting in a pool of wine on a wine-soaked scooter that just died under her


&gt;Hell, the mess was there when she got there!


&gt;My sides cannot take this abuse


&gt;The fact that Muh Muh is completely helpless and confined to an unmoving scooter does not deter her in the slightest from throwing every insult she can at the Wildebeetus


&gt;Both decide to take a break to gasp for air


&gt;FB is sitting on his scooter on the opposite side of center aisle


&gt;FP is stunned to see another human being that rivals his own size


&gt;All at once


&gt;The Wildebeetus takes advantage of this distraction, gets low, and pushed with a force greater than the gravitational force of a thousand hamplanets, evident because *the cart actually moves*


&gt;Such strength is truly impressive


&gt;The Wildebeetus in extreme frustration


&gt;Muh Muh replies


&gt;”*WOMAN!?* YOU AINT NO WOMAN YOU A MUTHERFUCKIN’ COW! YOU’RE TWO MUTHERFUCKIN COWS PUT TOGETHER! TWO UGLY FUCKIN COWS IS WHAT YEW ARE!


&gt;”FUCK YERR TOO YA HILLBILLY PIECE UH SHIT!” Muh Muh shrieks back


&gt;The disgusting ball of acidic


&gt;MUH MUH used SLUDGEBOMB ! MUH MUH’s attack missed !


&gt;”*JIST STEP ON THE FUCKIN’ GAS!*” roars the Wildebeetus


&gt;At last Muh Muh does, for the electric motor actually kicks into a very low sounding action and the cart moves


&gt;Not before the Wildebeetus goes down on one knee


&gt;He is undeterred, but the argument is now one-sided as the Wildebeetus is winded and sweating profusely from moving Muh Muh through the store


&gt;Cursing the whole way


&gt;A triple wide wheelchair is procured from the van, pivot and fall into the wheelchair—with much assistance by the Wildebeetus, of course


&gt;GHB and I are having a smoke at the other entrance to store watching the developments


&gt;A hydraulic lift is lowered from the back end of the astrovan


&gt;The motor on the hydraulic lift starts up, *the back end of the van is lowering until the tires are contacting the wheel well* whereupon the motor stops


&gt;Thin privilege is not destroying every electric motor you come into contact with


&gt;This process is ritual to the Wildebeetus


&gt;MFW I have no face because the Wildebeetus has to tuck parts of Muh Muh in


&gt;Without further ado, the back tires scraping the wheel wells at every little bump


&gt;We can hear Muh Muh and the Wildebeetus screaming at each other even with the doors closed


&gt;I say a silent


&gt;”Well


&gt;GHB comments that Ms. BB insinuated to him that we would be assisting with cleanup duty


&gt;I groan
once more with one simple line:


&gt;”Where’s Daughtermoon?”

My thighroidbeetusdishun is acting up, at least till the (shortish) epilogue comes along. I can’t type another word, I have to rest, muh gloopclose, muh beetus!

EP did attempt to get her no longer beta boyfriend back, his family's houses (including where we were that night, which was his brother's place), some of his friends. She caused scenes at every single one, and tried these pseudo-intellectual arguments to try and get him to ""see reason"". I don't know what arguments she used, but he said that she treated it like a debate, or a lecture.

For awhile, but I *said* we did that night when we were alone (we never were alone the entire night). Again, people weren't buying her shit, even the people who texted me the next day to ask what was up. 

Eventually, had music playing. He had walked through the door and nearly shit himself, thinking some crazed madman was about to rape him in the most romantic way possible. Until EP came walking out of the kitchen looking like Betty Crocker's fatter sister in an apron, telling him that she had done all of that for him, so he had to give her a chance. 

No joke, then tries to run. Actually falls down the stairs of the building where he lived and hurt her ankle enough that she needed his help to get up. Actually tried to have him *help her to the car* so she could get away from the cops. 

[LOL Nope!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/nope.gif)

The cops get there eventually, nor was any property destroyed. She had gotten in using a spare key he had forgotten she had. That he would be better off just letting her go, filing an official disturbance report, and then getting a restraining order if she continued. 

At this point the the ex was just like, but that she was walking a thin line. She was promising never to come near him again, and so they let her go.

&gt; Another school

&gt; Beretta says she's sick can't come to set up.

&gt; Actually couldn't find a ride with anyone.

&gt; Next day we all have to find ways to the competition because our school is poor and refuse to bus us again.

&gt; insert rant about how if we were a sport we'd get a bus.

&gt; This time

&gt; Everyone meets up at the high school and we get our caravan going.

&gt; In our designated classroom

&gt; Director shows up half an hour after the rest of us

&gt; Blondie

&gt; ""Guys

&gt; Um

&gt; ""I thought you

&gt; ""Beretta

&gt; Beretta sputters for a minute over excuses before wandering away.

Fast forward through the next couple of hours watching other plays. Now, Beretta, and about five other people are planted audience members for our play. Because we don't want people to know, the minute the shows actually start we all take our designated seats and act like our characters. Luckily Beretta isn't trusted with any major parts so she sits in back.

Everything goes great and we get some awesome review from other schools and the judges. But

&gt; Be me

&gt; ""HHG

&gt; ... I guess.

&gt; ""Beretta came with me here but I really think she should ride home with you. You know I don't care for bullying and promising her a ride then leaving her wasn't very nice.""

&gt; ""She said you did.""

&gt; Don't be stupid

&gt; ""At any rate

&gt; dontbebetadon'tbebeta. Be nice. Shrug.

&gt; ""Thank you

Now, president of SADD, a Student conflict resolver, a section leader in band, and a Freshman Mentor. I can't just blow up and refuse to help someone even if they are a jerk or I don't want them in my car. Director, whose wife was the Faculty Advisor for both SADD and Student Conflict Resolution, knew that I'd have to say yes when bullying was involved.

Also

&gt; Beretta come on

&gt; ""Really? Well

&gt; No

&gt; Beretta pouts but gets in the back seat.

The drive home was mostly uneventful. If Beretta tried to bitch I'd just turn the radio on. Blondie was texting back and forth with our friends in other cars and we decided that we'd meet up at Blondie's house for a bit of an after-show party. The other cars had already stopped and eaten places

&gt; ""HHG..."" 

&gt; Don't need a crystal ball to know where this was headed.

&gt; Yeah, but the dining room is closed. We're hitting the drive thru.

&gt; Go through the drive thru.

&gt; Two grilled chicken sandwiches, two small fries, one small frosty, one small ice tea. That's all for the first order.

&gt;Beretta

&gt; ""I want the double baconator meal, frosty, and a large orange pop!""

&gt; Pay for the food. Receive two bags with all of our food mixed up.

&gt; Pull in to parking lot to sort this shit out.

&gt; Blondie had already handed the bigger bag back to Beretta

&gt; ""HHG

&gt; ""They forgot my french fries!"" whined Beretta in the back seat.

&gt; Okay

&gt; Pull up to window explain problem.

&gt; Car that was behind us originally behind us again.

&gt; Huh

&gt; Manager comes to window. ""Ladies

&gt; I look at Blondie. ""We were only missing food

&gt; Manager looks puzzled. ""You didn't accidentally get chicken nuggets and a medium fry in the one bag with a baked potato and Baconator?""

&gt; Blondie and I both turn to look at Beretta. There's an empty chicken nugget box on the seat next to her.

&gt; You've got to be kidding me.

&gt; Beretta

&gt; ""Well

&gt; Manager blinks. ""Ma'am

&gt; Awkward silence when no one know what to do or say.

&gt; Manager sighs

&gt; drive away.

&gt; Beretta

&gt; ""How was I suppose to know I couldn't eat it?""

&gt; You didn't fucking pay for it!

&gt; ""Whatever

&gt; Yes, married, 50yr old drama teacher. 

&gt; ""He probably likes me

&gt; No, does a good job. I doubt very much it was because of her body type.

&gt; ""Nuh-uh

&gt; Well

&gt; Blondie is trying hard not to laugh. She looks like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-31614-body-shape.htm?StartAt=14#.Ub8ZqxySmSg) and for the record was playing the role of a forty year old woman.

&gt; keep driving, right to take Beretta home.

&gt; Turn right.

&gt; No.

(Doing my best with the formatting



&gt; Be me

&gt; Be 10 years ago. I'm 22

&gt; Meet Hamplanet. Let's call her DS. She is my (now former) roommate. 5'0

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/no-def-not.gif) DS's first words upon deciding to get a place together: ""awwhhhmahgerd! WE CAN SHARE CLOTHES!""

&gt; Meet friend (SN) who is preggers. She's single, we wanted to do what we could to try and cheer her up through a difficult time in her life

&gt; Setting: our 2 bedroom apartment in the city

&gt; Meet awesome BFF (CW) who offers to help me organize a baby shower for SN



Some background on DS (roommate): We are all well aware that DS has some pretty serious issues upstairs. No one ever really invites her along when we go out




Couple quick side tidbits for context ...

Her obsession with motherhood:
&gt; **DS discovers SN's impending single motherhood**

&gt; First words out of DS's mouth: ""I can't wait to be a single mother




&gt; **Upon the birth of SN's baby**

&gt; SN frequently had to call the nurses to pry her baby from DS's greasy arms

&gt; Earthquake-inducing temper-tantrum always follows




&gt; **Manipulation by tears**

&gt; At one point during our tenure as roommates

&gt; To date

&gt; And while it would have been disturbing to hear her sounds of sexy-time when he stayed over

&gt; Found out later that this was because she wanted his baby &amp; he was flat-out refusing to provide




Her fashion sense:
&gt; **First time going to a bar with DS after becoming roomies**

&gt; Don't pay much attention to what DS decided to wear (she has some STRANGE fashion sense

&gt; Step into bar

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif) ""WHAT THE HELL?! How could you let DS leave the house dressed like that?""

&gt; Turns out

&gt; She had some MAJOR camel-toe going on

&gt; Coupled with a COMPLETELY sheer top

&gt; facepalm




&gt; **Halloween**

&gt; [mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/marilyn-monroe-yuck-.gif) DS asks to borrow my Little Schoolgirl costume ""teeheehee""

&gt; Costume = size 4. DS = size windsail. 

&gt; DS insists. I finally agree for the lulz of it

&gt; Costume explodes in a cloud of dust &amp; blubber tears when she tries to squeeze into it 

&gt; DS goes as a Geisha instead - wears 3-sizes-too-small ""kimono"" &amp; tries to bare her thighs for anyone who can handle staring for more than 2 seconds

&gt; DS frequently mistakes cellulite-jiggle-hypnosis for appreciation of her ""assets"" throughout the night

&gt; She spends the majority of the night convincing anyone who will listen that half of the males in the bar have agreed to go home with her




Misc weirdness:
&gt; **BABY**

&gt; DS had been forced by her parents to give up a baby she'd had when she was 14. Yes

&gt; However, but she liked to try and tell everyone otherwise)*

&gt; You don't ""continue to get pregnancy morning sickness"" 10 years afterwards (*she never actually made herself throw up or anything

&gt; In DS's universe




Around the time that we started planning the baby shower, would go out to the bar EVERY NIGHT, come home at 3am &amp; Hamplanet STOMP into the house, slam doors, turn on all the lights, turn the TV on at max-volume, etc. I did, work

End of the 2nd month, she just expected me to cover her share until she got around to paying me back. Me being a spineless beta, it was 3 months later that I finally worked up the nerve to ask her for the money back.

&gt; All of the above taken into account




So baby shower approaches &amp; DS is slowly-but-surely becoming more and more neurotic as the day gets closer. 3 days before baby shower ...

&gt; Get home from work

&gt; Come to my senses a few moments later

&gt; Discover DS in her bedroom

&gt; Bed on it's side

&gt; Pictures torn from walls

&gt; Blubberball sitting on the floor

&gt; Try to avoid looking directly at the trainwreck &amp; exclaim ""DS!! WTF?""

&gt; (accompanied by a gigantic sniffle that sucked-up half the sweat &amp; tears off the floor) 

&gt; ""awwhhhmahgerd why didn't you include me in the party plannin?!?! 

&gt; It's because I have IBS and it causes the toilet to clog

&gt; It's because your Halloween costume had the wrong size tag on it &amp; it got ripped

&gt; It's because I'm still carrying some pregnancy weight

&gt; Why do you discriminate? Why u so mean?""

&gt; Beta me in shock. I say meekly ""DS

&gt; I couldn't even comment on the accusations. I was speechless.

&gt; The blubber-tearsweats start back up at a fever pitch

&gt; Spend remainder of the week tip-toeing around the apartment &amp; eventually fall asleep each night listening to sounds akin to a baby seal being clubbed




WEEKEND!!! PAR-TAY TIME!!!! WOOHOO!!!




&gt; Guests begin arriving. SN so excited. Did not expect this. Starts crying. All girls except DS give her a hug.

&gt; DS starts crying. All girls look at her

&gt; DS: ""SN

&gt; CRASH. BANG. BOOM. We all get pulled into DS orbit as she attempts to ""run"" across the room and into SN's frightened arms

&gt; CW and I freeze in our tracks. Look at each other. Run to intercept blubberball running full-steam-ahead into baby belly. Phew

&gt; CW: ""wait DS .. did you just say party that YOU planned?""

&gt; DS: ""YES! And NO THANKS to YOU or Sare81! I could have used the help. Do you have ANY IDEA how expensive this was? But NO! YOU SKINNY BITCHES DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE I HAVE IBS!""

&gt; speechless

&gt; CW also being spineless beta like me

&gt; Afternoon/evening progresses. DS behaving as expected.

&gt; Lasagne comes out of the oven. NOMNOMNOM DINNER!

&gt; Leave lasagne on counter to cool to edible temp!

&gt; Come back into kitchen 5 minutes later, LITERALLY SHOVELLING THE FOOD INTO HER MOUTH STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PAN

&gt; Beta me switches into alpha mode 

&gt; Alpha me flips a lid

&gt; Alpha me shouts obscenities

&gt; Girls come running and discover DS

&gt; DS: ""I think I might be pregnant""

&gt; ""I don't understand why you'd let her do something like that!""

&gt; *Say what?*

That's right, because she started shit talking. To my mom! Not that my mom would say anything, she's the kind to smile and nod and say confrontations aren't worth it. Not, I though.

&gt; I freeze at the door. Maybe they were going back to whatever they were talking about before I burst in? 

&gt; Optimism is bad

&gt; ""I mean

&gt; *The fuck?! How old does this bitch think I was?!*

&gt; I turn to watch

&gt; ""Excuse me."" Pudgette turns to look at me, keeping a blank, slightly pleasant expression on my face. 

But mom knew what's going to happen

&gt; Pudgette looks surprised

Side note: the way my parents and the people they associate with function

&gt; ""You don't need to lose weight anyway

&gt; Even though I know that saying this never works, mostly.""

&gt; Her eyes widen

&gt; ""You're *sweating*!"" Her tone suggests that sweating is the worst thing that can happen to someone

&gt; ""That... kind of means that it's working..."" *Among other things

&gt; ""But that's gross and smelly and *disgusting!* Besides!"" (*here we go!*) ""Men don't want a hard woman! They want soft curves!""

&gt; Mom pales. 

&gt; I lose the last of the pleasantness in my face and voice. ""I'm not doing this for men, ""And as for sweat being gross? We have an invention around here, *dear*, it's called a shower. Maybe you should try it sometime.""

I tell you guys, I just had to see how much damage I did to the interaction between Pudgette and my mom, so I dressed up and went back down to the living room.

This story actually isn't from my years in retail, so save the jimmy rustlin for the fat logic.

A bit of back story before we start: in high school, who is a really nice person. At her fattest, she weighed in at 300 lbs. This actually wasn't her fault, her parents are fatlogic royalty and would yell and scream at her when she made any attempt whatsoever to lose weight. Since moving out of her parents' house, she lost 180 lbs and looks amazing. This story is not about R, but it does involve her, so I thought I'd clear things up about her a bit.

Be me, 160 lbs, curvy in-shape runner. I get invited to my friend L's birthday party. It is her “Sweet 16,” but her parents can't afford to throw a huge party so 30+ of us friends all agree to bring the food as long as her parents provide plates, cups, utensils, and decorations. I make deviled eggs because who the hell doesn't like deviled eggs? For these eggs

I get to L's place with the eggs on two huge party platters. At this point absolutely zero eggs had been consumed. With the help of my friend J (R's boyfriend), but we don't say anything because this is L's party and C is her relative.

L asks if anyone is hungry, all 30-something of us are paying attention to the movie, not the fatty. When the movie ends we all head into the kitchen for some snacks and lo and behold, we see one egg plate *completely* empty and C is stuffing the last of the deviled eggs from the other plate into the gaping black hole in her face.

MFW this bitch ate SIXTY eggs complete with a jar and a half of mayo and two pounds of bacon (well, that's a fucking lot).

C: “Oh hey guys

At this point I can't control myself. I shout at her

C: “Well it's not my fault they're so small teehee you should have made more! Then there would have been enough for everyone!”

My blood is boiling over at this point but it is R who speaks up.

R: “YOU ATE *SIXTY* FUCKING EGGS YOU FAT FUCK! HAVE YOU NO FUCKING SHAME?! THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR PIECES EACH! WHY IS IT THAT FAT PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO EAT EVERYTHING IN FUCKING SIGHT?”

OFW C just got fat-shamed by another fat person. C starts whaling

C: “You don't own this place! You can't kick me out! Only your parents can

L's mom: “C

C whales the whole time she's waiting for her mom about fat-shaming, but we're even more surprised that she had the physical strength to grab C and force her out to the car. The rest of the party everyone is a little bummed that they were robbed of my delicious eggs. I was bummed too, 3 hours of making the perfect eggs for L's party ruined by some fat fuck that couldn't control herself.

I live in a house with three people I went to uni with, though right now she's more of a huddling mass waiting to explode to full potential. 

5'9""

Annnnnd onto the story. I greentexted the last ones

Switch that shit up

My goodness I am so white. 

So for the past two days I have been *sick*. Like, but I am caving and taking off here as soon as the Medicentre opens because I am not sleeping anymore. 

So I've been curled up on my couch, drifting in and out of consciousness, leaking all sorts from my face being generally gross. 

Sorry boys

Eventual Planet has a really awesome mom who brought me soup because I am ""an orphan"" as she put it (my dad lives ~3 hours away from where I do and we all know I don't talk to my mom). Eventual planet is angry because her mom bought me a cup of soup from Tim Horton's and I ate it without giving her (the planet) any. 

""You just could have shared

Yeah okay

I am bitchy when I'm sick. 

Anyways. Obviously if I don't have enough energy to even move from the couch and walk across the room without feeling dizzy

Wouldn't you agree?

Alright kids

So there's pathetic/gross me, bad fan and neglected the television due to three jobs. 

Eventual Planet decides to take a break from whatever she was doing and joins me to watch. 

Doesn't watch either show but is pretty obsessed with Matt Smith. I don't get it

Good luck unseeing that. 

Anyways. 

She's interrupting my viewing pleasure with questions about the series until finally I give up and pause the damn thing because clearly she wants to talk. 

I let her complain about being single for a bit and then inevitably it switches to bitching about her ex

I am being a good friend and listening to her grievances

Somehow, the topic switches to health. I think she was talking about the HAES (Healthy at Any Size) that Small Moon introduced her to at our LAN party a few days ago. I wrote a story on that. It's somewhere. 

At any rate

She gets mad and defensive and says that I'm wrong. No reason

Okay

And anyways

I'm a little confused at this point and just letting her ramble because talking hurts,"" and ""I'm not getting proper nutrition."" She is ""very very worried about me"" and ""thinks I should seek help."" 

I, inform the Eventual Planet that my sickness has NOTHING to do with my fitness or nutrition, and that if she knew even the first thing about anything medical she would know my symptoms do not coincide with malnutrition or physical over-exertion. 

Incoming! 

It's fat logic

We're doomed. 

&gt;You are not *meant* to be skinny. 

&gt;Everyone's body is different

&gt;And look where it's gotten you. 

&gt;Now that you've taken time off exercise

Yeah

&gt;And you're not eating so your body is in starvation mode and eating itself because you've burned all of its reserves away. 

&gt;So basically all of the work you've done is being undone. 

&gt;Do you really want to live like that? Work so hard then you can't even take a break for a day because it sets you back so far?

Shut up

&gt;I hate seeing you like this. 

At this point I might have lost it. I don't remember much other than seeing red. I do remember I told her ""it's a fucking cold

It's probably more than a cold

Anyways

Fast forward to about 20 minutes ago. No longer FPS just pissed me off (I always seem to add a little non-FPS at the end of all of these... I have a problem). 

I am clearly up. My bedroom door stays open 90% of the time because I own a cat and he likes to wander in and out of my room. I am on my computer because I can't sleep and there's nothing better to do that involves not moving just in case I pass out. 

Eventual Planet is still writing finals because of some secondary uni whatever thing I don't understand it

She gets up obscenely early for who knows what reason and lazes around the house for a few hours before leaving every day. I honestly think she thinks it gives her some sort of superiority over the rest of us because both Tiny Roommate and I sleep until 10ish every day (well

Usually doesn't notice when I'm gone at 4am. I come home and every time she acts surprised and says she thought I was still sleeping. Whaaaaaatever. 

Today she pokes her head into my room. 

""Wow

Frothing at the mouth. 

All of my rage.

&gt; Can't get her kicked out for weed because Dramagirl smokes as well.

&gt; Being a gigantic^tee-hee slut isn't a violation of the renter's agreement.

&gt; Can't prove she slept with a 16 year old.

&gt; We're super stumped. :( 

&gt; **HOWEVER** 

&gt; One day

&gt; Saggy has a cute black baby sitting on her ~~tree trunk~~ knee

&gt; ""Hey Saggy......uhhhhh.....Where'd you get the baby?"" I say.

&gt; Saggy says her girlfriend is really busy today and Saggy agreed to watch her baby.

&gt; Baby is probably a year and a half

&gt; Dramagirl and I coo and make baby talk to him

&gt; BABIES!!!! D'AWWWWWWWW!

&gt; We start to realize pretty quickly though that there's something weird about this baby. It just kinda....stares. And only stares.

&gt; He never giggled.

&gt; He never made any baby talk.

&gt; He never ONCE cried the whole time he was there.

&gt; Night time rolls around and the baby is still with Saggy

&gt; ""I guess he's spending the night!"" Saggy says excitedly.

&gt; Day three rolls around

&gt; Baby is playing on the ground

&gt; Saggy goes to pick up this baby

&gt; Dramagirl and I both start to freak out. 

&gt; ""SAGGY YOU CAN'T PICK UP A BABY LIKE THAT! YOU'LL PULL HIS ARM OUT OF ITS SOCKET!""

&gt; Saggy is not giving two shits.

&gt; ""I gotta pick him up dat way I can't bend down and get him. Besides

&gt; [OFW](http://i.imgur.com/0pdI3K9.gif)

&gt; Saggy smacks him a little bit on the cheek.

&gt; Baby still does not make a peep.

""Seeeeeeee!?""

&gt; Dramagirl and I share a look of horror.

&gt; Saggy serves the baby a plate of chicken nuggets

&gt; Gets angry with baby when baby doesn't finish it all.

&gt; Baby still didn't cry.

&gt; Found out a few years later this is an almost sure sign of extreme child abuse.

&gt; Baby's momma shows up after 5 days of being AWOL. Apparently she went to the city with some boyz. Saggy is jelly and sad the little boy is leaving.

&gt; Saggy mopes around the house for the next week saying she has post-partum depression LOL.

&gt; Dramagirl and I start seeing animal turds all over the house.

&gt; Clean them up in confusion.

&gt; A few days later we hear the kitten. 

&gt; Saggy keeps it shut in her room almost 24/7. 

&gt; Dramagirl and I aren't heartless bitches

&gt; How many of you think she expended the calories to litter train the cat?

&gt; No one?

**For reference (or a key if you will);**

&gt;""PorkPlanet"" - Name says it all. Housemate. 350+ 1b (estimate) Sociopath. She does not like my new and improved fat2fit life

&gt;""AS"" - Housemate. Intolerant of PorkPlanet. Bad-ass. 

&gt;""KK"" - Housemate. Health &amp; Fitness goddess. Quiet and thoughtful. Also a redditor

&gt;""Cuteguy"" - Boyfriend. Hillarious. Bit of a Jackass to PorkPlanet for reasons. Here for the lelz. 

**There are other characters (other housemates which I will mark as #1, Uni friends) but the ones above feature heavily so these will be the only ones introduced for now in each chapter.**

------------------------------
***Foreshadowing: This story/transcript isn't really going to make sense unless you've read the series previously and know PorkPlanet.*** 

Ok guys, have left the building and formed new lives in different countries. You're all deeply rustled and I can understand perfectly. You need to know about the fight I mentioned at the end of the hospital visit story between ""AS"" and PorkPlanet and the faithful OP I am, I have delivered.

In summary, disruptive and eventually aggressive towards AS, all while I sat in my hospital bed only a few hours after surgery ""wtf'in"" and trying to keep the peace. 

When KK, especially towards me. 

Tensions have been rising between the two for a long time, for reasons, but I will instead type up a few of the golden statements from the argument. It was nearly 20 minutes in length. 

The caps are there to highlight how shouty it all a bit was. 

For those who love AS

-------------------

&gt; AS: You were such a fucking bitch at the table what IS wrong with you?

&gt; Porkplanet: THE NURSE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ME I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

*lelelel*

-----------
&gt;AS: You OBVIOUSLY have a problem with Cuteguy being with imgonnamakeit

&gt; Porkplanet: HE DOESN'T TREAT HER PROPERLY. HE ENCOURAGES HER WITH ALL THIS WEIGHT LOSS STUFF. SHE'S BEEN DIFFERENT SINCE SHE GOT WITH HIM. YOU KNOW THAT. I CAN TELL WHAT HE'S LIKE.

&gt; AS: Are you fucking joking me. He only encourages her because it makes her happy to be doing something constructive with her life. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

&gt; AS: WHATEVER YOU THINK IT MEANS. YOU SIT ON YOUR ARSE WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM UNI EVERY DAY  AND COMPLAIN THAT WE'RE ALL OUT AT THE GYM OR DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHATEVER I DON'T WANT TO COME TO  THE GYM WITH YOU.

&gt; AS: GOOD BECAUSE YOU'D FUCKING CAUSE A SCENE THERE AS WELL.

---------
&gt; AS: So you think imgonnamakeit was happier in her relationship with exboyfrend?

&gt; Porkplanet: WELL SHE WAS  DIFFERENT AND HE CERTAINLY NEVER ENCOURAGED HER TO GO AND LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE HER OWN LIFE. HE ACCEPTED HER FOR WHO SHE IS.

&gt; AS: Are you fucking nuts? 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHAT?

&gt; AS: All he ever did was make comments about her weight and make her feel like shit. 

&gt; Porkplanet: WHATEVER SHE WAS HAPPY.

&gt; AS: You are so fucking dense. 

*Sidenote; Porkplanet and Exboyfriend have been friends for a long time. Probably why she white knights him so much

--------
&gt;  Porkplanet: When we were at imgonnamakeits parents for bank holiday weekend

&gt; AS: NO HE WASN'T. HOUSEMATE #2 WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT FUCKING WEEKEND SHE WAS THERE THE LAST TIME WE WENT. AND CUTEGUY WASN'T THERE THEN. YOU'RE FUCKING LYING ABOUT CUTEGUY LOOKING AT OTHER WOMEN NOW? WOW.

&gt; Porkplanet: *silence*

*Obviously this is the funniest piece of the whole audio to me. I can't believe that if she was going to make a lie up about cuteguy like that she wouldn't get the facts right.** 

------------
&gt;AS: *mumbles*... YOU BROKE HER FUCKING HAND TO BEGIN WITH.

&gt; Porkplanet:  NO I DIDN'T STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT.

&gt; AS: YOU ROLLED THE ROCK ONTO IT. THEN FUCKING CRUSHED THEM.

&gt; Porkplanet: NOT ON PURPOSE WITH THE ROCK. AND I DIDN'T CRUSH THEM.

*lololol*

---------
&gt;Porkplanet: *mumbles about my weight loss* She looks unhealthy. 

&gt; AS: What the fucking hell are you talking about now? She looks AMAZING. Men have turned their heads on the street when we walk past. She's BEAUTIFUL. You're just FUCKING JEALOUS. I can't believe you would even say something so stupid. She's the opposite of unhealthy. She's the healthiest she's ever been.

&gt; Porkplanet: I've never seen that with the men so whatever. STOP SAYING I'M JEALOUS.

----

&gt; AS: EVERYONE fucking talks about how [RIDICULOUS you looked wearing the same outfit](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f267s/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_pt1_the_night_out/) as imgonnamakeit that night. When are you gonna realize? PEOPLE FUCKING KNOW HOW JEALOUS OF HER YOU ARE.

&gt; Porkplanet: I DIDN'T KNOW SHE BOUGHT THAT OUTFIT. 

&gt; AS: YES YOU DID. Everyone fucking knows it. And people laugh [about the fucking pole](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1f2gb2/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_one_part_2/).

&gt; Porkplanet: THE POLE WAS ALREADY BROKEN!!!

*Right, reddit? right...?* 

-------
&gt; AS: You are such a burden to live with and be around.... You make us all just not want to hang out with you after Uni. Do you know how fucking hard it is? Do you? 

&gt;  Porkplanet: JUST MOVE OUT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME CAUSE I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

&gt; AS: You better hope WE don't move out. 

&gt; Porkplanet: You guys have a year and a half left on the lease. 

&gt; AS: I'm sure we can arrange for some FUCKING IDIOTS to take over our contracts so you can live with people more suitable. 

*Everybody

-----

&gt; AS: *mumbling* you're a fucking nightmare *mumbling mumbling on the microphone* 

&gt; Porkplanet: I'M GONNA SLAP YOU IN A MINUTE.

&gt; AS: GO ON THEN

*Housemate #2 stepped in at this point

---------
&gt; AS: Fuck this

&gt; Porkplanet: That's right

&gt; AS: What? Is that it? Are you jealous of mine and hers friendship? Cause we spend time together

&gt; Porkplanet: *scoffs* Your friendship doesn't even come close to the friendship she and I have. 

&gt; AS: Oh my god

Today, or 100 meters for your non-Muricans), got out of my car, and began to shuffle my booty towards the building. It's fucking hot, I'm wearing all black because of work clothes, and there is no shade. So I'm shufflin' really fast.

&gt;&gt;Datsweetairconditioning.unf

I feel an odd pull on me

&gt;&gt;Rest in peace

This car comes screeching up to the fire lane. Now

&gt;&gt;F=ma

&gt;&gt;F=Hamplanet x 30mph (^RustyBrakes )

&gt;&gt;F=NOPE

Two women got out of the car. Lady driver stays in the car. She is a normal sized lady, is a little tubbier, 5'4 140, but I'm not judgin'. Then I notice that they brought a pet with them. I slow down to make sure they don't leave their elephant in the car. Animal cruelty is bad, mmkay? Then the door opens with a low groan of rusted metal.

I stop when it hits me. It smells like oily fish and cheap car perfume, fleshy, well-manicured foot comes out. I see plastic talons glued onto her toes, covered in rhinestones and garish pink polish. I see ashy ankles and pasty white, scaly looking heels.

&gt;&gt;*screeeeeeech*

The *thing* within comes out. I feel a massive tug on my limbs and I go tumbling against a tree for support.

&gt;&gt;Tree shivers in protest

She stands up and I am in awe of her figure. This luscious specimen of Amazonian perfection stands at 6'2 in flip-flops. Her face is small, and the toothpicks are her calves. Her thighs are each the size of my hips. Her thighs have fupas of their own, little pouches of fat and skin that droop down over her knee cap. I can't even begin to estimate a weight. 400 lbs, perhaps?

It's obvious that I'm jelly, sausages perched upon toothpicks. Her feet can't even come together. Instead of walking, the great Amazonian Beluga does this weird, side-to-side penguin shuffle to kick her legs up off the ground and swing them forward. I can hear the denim between her upper thighs screeching in protest. Because of this, I now know how spontaneous combustion occurs.

All the time, and then I immediately reprimand myself for being such a fat-shaming anorexic little bitch.

I shuffle by her and open the door. Since she's so far away

&gt;&gt;timeforalibrarycardYEAH

I wait patiently in line in the library. It's a long line, sweat glistening upon her lumpy, luscious lovejugs. I politely look away because I can't handle all dem currrves. She immediately glares at me and stomps over. I grab the counter to steady myself.

&gt;&gt;Poor young Asian girl grasps valiantly at my hand

""SCYUSE ME

""Yes?"" I whisper in response.

""DIS BE DA LINE FO CHECKIN SHIT OUT?""

""Yes.""

The librarian is starting to get upset now. I scoot away another inch or two in the hopes of getting away from her gloriously gigantic gunt. She comes closer and slaps a piece of paper down on the counter, and the universe.

&gt;&gt;A Hamplanet can flap her wings in Texas and cause an earthquake in Australia

&gt;&gt;I'm so sorry

&gt;&gt;so sorry

""AWRIGHT

Librarian sees opening.

""Ma'am, or you will leave. I will give you your book as soon as you get in line.""

I brace myself for impact.

""WAT CHOO MEAN LINE? DER AIN'T NO LINE HERE!""

I look behind me - there's at least nine people behind me. Librarian gives her look that could freeze hell.

""Lower your voice. I will not ask you again. There is a line, the wheels in her mind turning slowly as she reads the words out loud.

""LOOK LADY

&gt;&gt;Is this my first RL FPS?

&gt;&gt;I think it is

&gt;&gt;omg

"" - BAD KNEES. I'M HERE ALREADY

Librarian ignores her while the other people in front of me get their books. Beluga finally gets the hint and goes to the end of the line. People can breathe a little easier now. Blue pallor of small gentleman behind me disappears. Color returns to his cheeks. He looks relieved.

&gt;&gt;Suddenly

When it's my turn

""Last book

I take my books and quickly waddle for the stairs. I hear the explosion half-way up.

""WAT CHOO MEAN DER AIN'T NONE LEFT?! WHO TOOK IT?""

Like one of those bad movies

""HEY

I shuffle up the stairs and hide behind a bookshelf. Beluga tries to send Chubby Friend after me

Lauren, but in size. She had once complained to me about needing to shop in the “Junior” section of clothing stores (though, I confess, I'd not had any idea what that meant). Imagining her as being overweight was not just difficult, it was... well, *unimaginable*.

It happened in a KFC. My friend and I arrived in the bare, we heard a deep disturbing cry.

""MOVE OUT OF THE WAY I WAS HERE FIRST."" A large 6'0 Caucasian man in a too tight leather jacket and shorts pushed us out of the way; he was definitely pushing around 450 pounds of gool ol' fat.

Whatever. We're too fucking passive to say anything. We don't say a word and let him push us out of the way.

He orders this enormous amount of food: Bucket of Original Fried Chicken, Cole Slaw, and a regular coke.

Finally he takes his 450 pound self to the elevators to go on the second floor. We watch that monstrosity leave, we see Mr. Whale go up to the soda machine, and refill his soda. He refills it, ten times. TEN. HOW DOES SOMEONE FILL THEIR SODA CUP TEN TIMES IN THE SPAN OF 15 MINUTES. HOW. 

The staff begins to notice this, all the liquids inside him must be aching to go to the toilet, so a minute later he heads to the restroom. 

While he was gone, but amazed.""

""Yeah dude

We hear a scream

It was the whale. The whale.

And the whale got harpooned.

My friend and I start asking around a few minutes later. We go up to one of the staff, ""That hefty man you saw over there a while ago, the one who cut you two in line? Well, he drank so much soda that he started shitting all over the stall. He barely got his pants down before it splattered all across the ceiling and floor. And the worst thing is, he got stuck. He's so fat that when he tried to squeeze in the restroom stalls, he got stuck and he couldn't get out. He's been in there for a couple of minutes. Poor Frank, he's going to have to clean that huge mess.""

Now, I shall give you a tale of idiocy from my past, in high school. 

&gt; Sitting down

&gt; No drop bears

&gt; A large shadow appears above me

&gt; Oh god

&gt; Prepare for a vicious assault on my face

&gt; Instead

&gt; What appears to both look and smell like rotten cottage cheese approaches me

The class idiot (genuine idiot. failed all her classes, 'slut' and 'whore', at the age of 14. I think she watched too many 90's R&amp;B videos. However, because she bragged about being a virgin when she converted to Catholicism a year later, I shall instead call her Rosie O'[DingDong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Dong). 

&gt; She breaths deeply

&gt; Her 'breasts' rise and fall under her 3 sizes too small blouse

&gt; Buttons look like they require counselling and diazepam

&gt; Private school emblem stretched to twice it's size on the pocket

&gt; ""Heeeeey! I couldn't find you eating lunch where you usually sit! This is such a nice spot

&gt; Always in a goddamn over enthusiastic tone

&gt; O'DingDong has trouble trying to sit on the ground

&gt; Thought that the lack of chairs would dissuade her

&gt; Thousands die from an earthquake in New Zealand as the shock waves from her ungraceful fall cause the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates to collide

&gt; New mountains are formed

Now, and she was away, so I tried my hardest to escape O'DingDong's orbit. But as we all know, physics is a bitch.

&gt; Slightly shuffle away

&gt; Be a recovering anorexic from a medical issue

&gt; Good ol' Aussie meat pie

&gt; See O'DingDong eyeing my nutrition source

&gt; ""Ugh

&gt; I half grunt at her

&gt; IDGAF about your opinions

&gt; ""Ya know

&gt; ""Meh. I don't really care too much. I just want to be able to concentrate in next period""

&gt; Continue munching down on my delicious pie

&gt; Long silence passes

&gt; I'm talking 15min or so

&gt; ""UGH. I can't believe you didn't even offer me any!""

&gt; ""Any of what?""

&gt; ""That pie""

&gt; ""I bought it

&gt; ""Because you're meant to be skinny

There is still about 30min of lunch left (full lunch hour FTW)

Even 'social isolation' was classified as bullying

&gt; Scoot up off the ground with a slight jump

&gt; Slide down the gully to jump over a creek to go to the library for some air conditioned reading

&gt; I fucking love rural schools

&gt; ""Hey! Wait for me!"" O'DingDong wails

&gt; Genuinely seems upset that I'm leaving

&gt; Good

&gt; Oh shitting dick balls

&gt; Realize I have to pretend to not want to run in the opposite direction

&gt; Stand there silently

&gt; Honestly a deep gully

&gt; ""This place is so backward. I wish I could attend a GOOD school in the city

&gt; Beginning of the end...

I managed to make it through the class without fainting, I had met my current SO, and had become close friends with him. He had just run away from home and was living in a caravan park, and staying at the private school on a full scholarship. For the purposes of this story, I shall call him Yak.

&gt; Yak at school

&gt; Dead certain that O'DingDong wouldn't come over

&gt; Take off our shoes and enjoy the cool creek

&gt; Playing around

&gt; Turn around, purely from sweat

&gt; ""Heeeeeeey Yak! I didn't see you yesterday!""

&gt; We kind of look at her

&gt; ""Come up here guizzzzze! I want someone to talk to. You know my thyroid will play up if I become active""

&gt; Never actually heard of a thyroid

&gt; Yak realises he has to go to music practice

&gt; ""Hey

&gt; He looks mournfully up at her cottage cheese arms

&gt; Told me later he would rather take a shotgun to the face

&gt; Like the cheeky bugger he is

&gt; O'DingDong starts to sniffle

&gt; Friend and I rush up to her

&gt; ""Oh thanks gurrrlz. It's ok. I know he really does like me. I saw him checking out girls with REAL curves""

&gt; Stifle my laughter

&gt; ""Yeah

&gt; Once we are sure she is calm

&gt; She runs off

&gt; Realize I would be the one in trouble

&gt; Don't give a fuck at this point

Here is another Hamgar story

&gt;Be just over half way through the semester

&gt;Be about an hour into class

&gt;Hamgar had already gone through 1 container of cookies (for once not family sized though) and had made a large dent in his first 3 liter

&gt;Professor is in the middle of lecturing the spinal chord when the door opens and a guy from the local pizza place walks in

&gt;""Pizza for Hamgar""

&gt;Think this is the first time in my life my jaw has actually dropped

&gt;Mother fucker ordered pizza and had it brought to a class...during the class

&gt;""Right here"" Hamgar shifts in his seat

&gt;The pizza dude opens the bag and one of the foulest smells that has ever come from food filled the room

&gt;Dear jesus christ and bacon

&gt;In total Hamgar order 4 large pizzas and 2 calzones and an undetermined number of bread sticks

&gt;While he is paying pizza guy asks if we are having a party 

&gt;""Nope"" Hamgar said

&gt;Pizza guy looks disturbed

&gt;Just shake my head

&gt;Pizza guy grasps what is about to happen and flees as anything within arms reach of a hamplanet is considered food when they go into hunger mode

&gt;Some people are actually choking on the smell of the pizza

&gt;Smell is so bad professor stops class and asks Hamgar what is on the pizza

&gt;Can't remember exact toppings, garlic, onions, sardines being just a few of the things he rattled off

&gt;Some students start to leave the room

&gt;Never knew food could smell so bad

&gt;Professor tell Hamgar to take the pizza outside

&gt;Hamgar starts on about his beetus-thyroid-hypoglycemia

&gt;Prof finds some sack somewhere and puts his foot down

&gt;Hamgar eventually relents (most likely to get back to stuffing his face in a timely manner) and goes outside with his grease feast

&gt;Smell begins to fade but still lingers

&gt;Back to learnin'

&gt;About 10 minutes later the door opens and Hamgar comes walking back in

&gt;He couldn't have finished all that food in that amount of time

&gt;Yes he did

&gt;Don't know if its on his breathe or if he finally ingested so much food its finally leaking out his pores

&gt;While the smell was terrible

&gt;To make up for the courtesy he exhibited

&gt;Prof waits till the noise stops before he continues his lecture

&gt;Just as he starts to speak against Hamgar lets out with a burp so loud it puts Krakatoa to shame

&gt;Am glad I was sitting far to the left of Hamgar as I'm fairly sure the people sitting in the rows directly in front of him got a fine misting of soda and saliva from the mouth explosion 

&gt;Can see the rage in prof's eyes

&gt;Rest of the class passes with out incident

&gt;Leave room and see pile of pizza boxes sticking out of trash can

&gt;He really did eat all that food in roughly 10 minutes

&gt;May god have mercy on the resources of this planet with people like Hamgar trying to fit as many of them down his gullet as possible

&gt;HamSis: Well

&gt;Fitmom: But he's not at all judgmental!

HamSis kept insisting FitMom was setting a terrible impression for her son.  

One of my favorite comments was when HamSis told FitMom that if FitMom was thin

**TL;DR** - Poor FitKid isn't going to be able to find a *real* woman because his mother is thin and has given him a terrible impression of what women look like.

&gt;everyone waiting

&gt;excited for dem games and dat junk food

&gt;taking a while for Bertha to settle in

&gt;why the hell won't she just take a seat

&gt;Distinct lack of curves up top

&gt;But the gods are kind

&gt;Friends want to go to rave

&gt;Check that this isnt 1995

&gt;Nope

&gt;ok.jpg

So at this point, I'm not sure how this came about. But tonight, my friends were excited to go to a club, so to the club I go. Theres me of course, my roommate and best friend who we will call Blondie, my bf and Blondies older brother Stretch (he's 6'7, hence name) and his friend Chuckles. Not sure if Chuckles is always high, but this guy is always laughing. Anyways.

&gt;Get dressed

&gt;Black sheath dress

&gt;lookingood.png

&gt;Stop at dollar store

&gt;We got dis.

 We make it to the club and theres no line outside. Simultaneously awesome and troubling. 

&gt;Struttin inside

&gt;Bros be mirnin

&gt;Stretch always attracts attention to himself

&gt;He also has long hair

&gt;Aint gon drive my car

&gt;We stop at the bar to open a tab

&gt;Hear a barn owl screech over the untss

&gt;Owls dont belong in the clurb

&gt;Wait thats not a barn owl

&gt;And shes coming right at us.

&gt;Biggums approaches


Breaking from green to describe Biggums, high heels, everyone has glow and glitter going on, but overall looks to be a pretty classy place. Music is actually pretty cool, everyone having a good time. 

Now Biggums. Biggums looks like she was dressed by someone trying to do a satire piece on teen rave culture. She's about 5'2, now plastered in sweat. Hair is a nasty dishwater blonde fading to box pink. Has on maybe 8 necklaces made of glowing pony beads, probably 20 bracelets of the same. Skirt on her is the width of my hand. But the worst, absolute most revolting piece of her attire was the tanktop. Hello Kitty. White. Probably size medium. Stretched over stomach tight enough so i can see every roll and the cavern of her bellybutton. And the centerpiece of this unholy masterpiece, she had cut down the middle of the collar to reveal her rather large, floppy boobs. Out of place like a vegetable on a fatties plate. Back to reality.

&gt;Oop

&gt;Biggums approacheth. 

&gt;Calculate her trajectory

&gt;Headed towards Stretch!

&gt;No time to warn him.

""OHHHH MY GODDDD! I LOVE YOUR HAIRRRRRR!!!"" 

&gt;Stretch is a little slut for attention

&gt;He makes the biggest mistake of the night

&gt;wink.exe

&gt;Something registers on her face. 

&gt;eyes droop down into bedroom mode

&gt;sidles up to Stretch

&gt;she asks his name breathily

&gt;situation not lost on Chuckles

&gt;Blondie being a true ride or die is now alternating between glaring at her and giving me ""Well?"" eyebrows

&gt;I decide to play it cool.

&gt;Stretch introduces himself

&gt;As soon as Biggums hears the word ""girlfriend"" her face darkens

&gt;She looks at me

&gt;She otherwise ignores me. For now.

So after that, laughing and talking with him and attempting to exclude me out of conversation. A little while passes with everyone sort of dispersing and meeting new people and I grab a dance with Stretch. Shit gets real.

&gt;Biggums begins ""raving""

&gt;wildly flinging arms around with glowsticks

&gt;endurance only lasts about 45 seconds before severely out of breath

&gt;Comes up to Stretch

""Streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetch

&gt;Stretch looks at me

&gt;I dont know what to do either

&gt;I make the biggest mistake of the night

&gt;I say go ahead

&gt;She looks back at me

&gt;Smug.exe

So Stretch takes Biggums to the side area where there couches were at and she sprawls across the couch. He stands awkwardly. I decided I would go dance and not worry

&gt;I dont understand how to format this

&gt;Black shirt is helping

&gt;Enter enter

&gt;There isnt much to tell yet but pretty much she made pass after pass

&gt;She laid down across the couch and all of a sudden was ""drunk"" lol

&gt;She told me to come sit down and lifted up her legs so i could. I didnt sit down.

&gt;Biggums decided to start a real talk about my girlfriend and how she was so thin and asked if she had an eating disorder or something

&gt;I told her that my girlfriend runs and thats all (Which is true Black shirt eats like a wolverine) 

Excuse me?

&gt;She laughed and said she was bi but she only likes girls with tits and asses and stuff and that Black Shirt had nothing in her dress but bones. She grabbed my hand (I was still standing up) and tried to place it on her girnormo boob to ""feel how fast her heart was beating"" and I decided to nope the fuck out back to my friends. 

Back to me now. Little did Stretch know, with Biggums in tow. He sits by me, and she is left standing. Maybe this will be enough to get her to leave.

&gt;So Blackshirt

Nope.


&gt;She squeezes my arm and laughs

&gt;ohfuckno.jpg

&gt;Blondie isnt having any of her shit

&gt;""Stretch likes thin girls

&gt;He agrees 

&gt;Biggums brushes this off and says that ""men like a girl with a GIRL body

&gt;Stretch says he likes small boobs because theyre perkier and prettier

&gt;Chuckles chuckles.

&gt;Biggums gets flustered 

&gt;Blondie sippin on rum and coke

&gt;Biggums turns to Stretch and says ""If youve never been with a REAL woman before

&gt;Stretch appears to be getting queasy.

&gt;She turns to me

&gt;""I bet youve never even gotten to feel big tits""

&gt;Cant say that I have

&gt;She reaches out

&gt;What

&gt;Oh god no

&gt;She puts her chubby hand on the back of my head

&gt;I am now looking at her stretchmarked and pocked under arm dingle dangle 

&gt;Her armpit appears to have heat rash

&gt;Everything happening in slow motion

&gt;""Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeee""

&gt;She pushes

&gt;my face

&gt;into

&gt;Her

&gt;boobs.

They were sweaty. They were cold

&gt;scream.exe

&gt;scream.exe

&gt;scream.exe

Stretch stands up

&gt;""WHAT ARE YOU SOME KINDA FUCKIN FAGGOT?""

&gt;Bad move

&gt;Several people turn to look at her

&gt;My face is actually wet and smells like her. 

&gt;I am about to cry

&gt;I wash my face

Stretch is waiting outside the bathroom door and we ride home troubled and disgusted. After Stretch and I got home

And now for the finale:


&gt; be me

&gt; meet up with the old crew

&gt; gossip ensues.

&gt; Apparently Beretta had a baby.

&gt; Named it Berettalyn. Seriously.

&gt; No one has seen her

&gt; Well that's nice for her I guess if she's happy

&gt; Few days later

&gt; Getting stuff for a BBQ

&gt; Suddenly I hear ""Hey

&gt; Oh hey

&gt; Realize she is now the spitting image of Mama Behemoth a few stories ago.

&gt; Be polite

&gt; Notice it has nothing but neon colored pre-packaged food and cheap beer.

&gt; I heard you had a baby

&gt; Her face falls. 

&gt; ""Nah, he got laid off from the boat factory because they said he took lunches that were too long, and he was real upset started drinking, and said he couldn't stay with me anymore.""

&gt; Sorry to hear that. Plenty of fish in the sea and all that.

&gt; ""Yeah, I was feedin her and stuff. After I had the baby it was hard for me to get around and he didn't help me at all. Just sat around and drank all day when he was around. Didn't get any better after he left.""

&gt; Oh where is the conversation going...

&gt; ""I had to have a C-section, I was on bed rest so I never lost any of my baby weight, not that I gained that much. So it was just me and the baby after Bo left.

&gt; .....I've never understood why women insist on sharing their birthing stories.

&gt; ""Family services you know, said she was dirty. I just took care of her the way my Mom told me how. We aren't city-folk, the lady didn't understand that. A little bit of drinking never hurt anyone, right? She was just a baby, she didn't need to be fed as often as me or you. Those clerks always tried to argue with me when I tried to spend my WIC money on real food instead of formula or whatever that nasty powder was they wanted me to give her.""

&gt; My face is frozen in a permi-smile because I literally have no idea how to react.

&gt; Beretta sighs, but neither can him. I made sure of that. Said I thought he was touching her.""

&gt; Pauses to wink at me and push the hair out of her eyes.

&gt; ""I can always have more kids

&gt; I nod hesitantly.

&gt; ""We should go hit a bar up sometime. Get ourselves some men.""

&gt; Sorry Beretta

&gt; ""You were always too uptight. You always were so organized

&gt; It's working out for me

&gt; ""Hey

&gt; Yes?

&gt; ""Can I have the brownie mix you have in your cart? I really don't want to walk back across the store to the baking section. Ever since I had my baby I get tired out real easily.""

&gt; Beta till the end




&gt; be me

&gt; Sadly

TL;DR Mildly annoying hamplanet turned vengeful hamplanet, she also accuses her ex of touching her inappropriately which is something that is reprehensible.

Gather 'round the doughnut box

&gt; Me be Land Whale Linda's (not real name) sister and reluctant 
&gt; bridesmaid. 

&gt; Linda be 5'6

**Part One - Dress Shopping**
&gt; It be sunny. It be warm. It be Saturday. But instead of enjoying it

&gt; KillMeNow.waaaaaaav

&gt; Store clerk be...concerned. Trying to find a ""flattering"" dress for Linda.

&gt; Linda's response to all of them: ""Wut? These dresses are too 

&gt; conservative. I wanna show off meh cuuuurves on meh big day!""

&gt; CollectiveCringe.jaypeg

&gt; She starts to get mad. Sweat and grease start beading on her 

&gt; forehead. ""Yeh have no idea what I want! Yeh jus' want meh to be 

&gt; frumpeh on meh big day!"" 

&gt; Pushes past everyone and starts looking at the rack of skimpy XS 
&gt; numbers. 

&gt; OhGod.gif

&gt; ""Dis!"" She waves a dress triumphantly in front of the clerk. ""Dis is da 
&gt; one! I love de purls!""

&gt; AwkwardSilence.wav

&gt; Store clerk: ""Ma'am
&gt; even have one in a suitable size for you to try on...""

&gt; ""DIS IS MY DRESS! I LIKE DE PURLS! MAKE IT HAPPEN!"" 

&gt; eyeroll.png

&gt; Clerk: ""But...I can't let you buy a dress without at least trying it on! 
&gt; Why not pick something from...something...over..."" 

&gt; Clerk gets Linda's killer whale look. 

&gt; ""Meh sisteh will try it on for meh
&gt; dress! I like de purls. They're deli-cat and they'll show off meh curves!"" 

&gt; OhHellNo.gif

&gt; LeaveMeOuttaThis.jpg


To fast forward this a bit: I try on the dress and realize why the clerk was trying to steer her towards something else. The dress is strapless, which is the biggest size they have in that style (10). I'm not thin, but my weight isn't crazy either, so the dress looks...meh but not awful.

&gt; Linda: ""OMG! I LURVE IT! MEH DRESS! THIS IS IT! MEH DRESS!!!"" 

&gt; Clerk: ""But I think...""

&gt; Me: ""Linda...You should really consider...""

&gt; Linda: ""FUCK YOU SKINNY BITCHES! I WON'T LET YEH TELL ME WHAT &gt; TEH WEAR! THIS IS *MEH* DAY AND *MEH* CHOICE! I WILL LOOK 
&gt; GORGEOUS! Y'ALL JUS' JEALOUS OF MEH CURVES!"" 

&gt; Clerk and I exchange resigned looks. It is *her* day and *her* choice.

&gt; Clerk: ""Yes ma'am...I'll get the measuring tape.""


Clerk spends forever taking Linda's measurements, and finally rings up the bill: $10,000. 
&gt; WTF.GIF

&gt; AreYouOutOfYourMind.wav

&gt; Facepalm.jpg


Linda goes to many fittings, move mountains and pray multiple times a day. Finally, the ""deli-cat purl dress"" is successfully supersized. Linda is ecstatic. Everyone in the family, including the groom, cringe and walk on eggshells whenever The Dress is brought up in conversation, which is often.

Fast forward to...

**Part 2 - The Wedding**

&gt; Linda be excited! It's her day at last! 

&gt; Family puts aside dress drama. Get excited. 

&gt; ItsAWedding.squee

&gt; The ceremonies be underway. 

&gt; Guests be cringing at the sight of the rolls of fat rippling down Linda's &gt; back

&gt; Ceremony be catholic. Priest gets bride and groom to kneel for 
&gt; communion. 

&gt; Linda kneels on her skirt. The bodice fabric pulls extra taught. Fat 
&gt; bulges out

&gt; LookAway.gif

&gt; Focus on prayer instead. Yes
&gt; I shut my eyes and then I hear a strange sound:

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Huh.jpg

&gt; I open my eyes in time to see the third string of pearls give way.

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; The fabric at the front starts to sag. Linda starts hanging on for dear 
&gt; life. 

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; The priest

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; WhatTheFuckDoWeDo.help

&gt; There are only a couple of strands left. Linda's situation is...precarious.

&gt; Linda starts crying. Her shoulders quivering

&gt; Everyone in the room
&gt; horror. No one dares breathe. No one moves. 

&gt; The priest keeps reading...

&gt; CalmBeforeTheStorm.exe

&gt; Linda gasps for air between sobs. And it is just too much for those 
&gt; pearls.

&gt; Snap! Snap! Tinkletinkletinkle! 

&gt; Fat rolls free! Boobs go flying!

&gt; Linda: ""Meh dress!!!!!""

&gt; Priest: ""GOOD GOD

&gt; Priest turns away quickly. Audience turns away quickly. 

&gt; New hubby
&gt; his blushing bride. 

&gt; It barely goes over her shoulders.

&gt; Linda: ""Wahwahwahwahwah!""

&gt; She huffs
&gt; the groom and my mom. 

&gt; Everyone else stays rooted to the spot.

&gt; WhatTheHellJustHappened.gif


Normally

Fortunately for Linda and her groom, we all reconvened and finished the ceremony. Despite the horror of the dress disaster, and no matter how much she deserved it, it was her wedding and love must prevail. At the end if the ceremony the cheers and applause for the newlyweds nearly shook the stain glass windows loose. 

Despite the happy ending

**TL;dr** Landwhale insists on wearing an open back, the pearls snapped and landwhale flashes the priest. Pandemonium ensues. Everyone pulls together, save the day. Priest seen later looking shell shocked and trying to get drunk on communion wine.

*Enter [Rod Serling](http://i.imgur.com/JTdRanv.gif) to narrate

.

""There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to ham. It is a dimension as vast as ""Hamthrax"" and as timeless as ""The Retail Whale."" It is the middle ground between the pannis and the fupa


""Witness, and the horrors of end-stage fatlogic as it metastasizes into something much, much more sinister.""

*Camera pans from Rod Serling over to OP. Jimmes begin to rustle*
&gt;&gt;Still be me

&gt;&gt;There were more hospital staff running in and out of Hamspanics room than I have ever seen in my life. Several physicians groups were on consult and Respiratory was in there every 20 minutes. 

&gt;Apparently, *supposedly*, the family had won some really nice settlement from the hospital claiming they were “under-equipped” to handle her. So everyone was trying to not screw this up and get stable enough to be shipped out of there to an acute care or something so they won't get sued if she dies on their watch.

&gt;&gt;When I wasn't helping clean up bodily fluids or holding up legs as the nurses cleaned out the kitty...the other part of my job was sitting at the desk in the ICU and continuously monitoring patient vitals such as heart rhythms, blood pressure, answering patient calls, and relaying commands and orders from doctors to the other departments of the hospital, and dealing with family members.

&gt;&gt;Family comes in to visit. [Enter GramHam

BTW child protective services had been notified by the social worker about his weight and were trying to get in an eval in the next few days. I never found out what happened with that.

Apparently it is all because of bad genes...right?


&gt;&gt;Hamspanic gets her food tray. 

[*Only one tray*](http://i.imgur.com/UGQjkKx.gif). 

&gt;&gt;And it's soup. 

[*Not served in an 80 gallon drum* 
](http://i.imgur.com/8Z2ROVs.gif)
&gt;&gt;Proceeds to flip the fuck out. 

&gt;&gt;Doctor put her on a calorie restricted/heart healthy diet. Roughly 1600 calories. Mostly liquids so that she could consume it rapidly without dying from lack of oxygen. Throws a huge hissy fit and the [nurse just walked out.](http://i.imgur.com/hpPj4dQ.gif)


45 minutes go by.


&gt;&gt;Working on physician orders. Begin to smell[ rusty meat.](http://i.imgur.com/L2swI30.gif) 

&gt;&gt;Look up to see a two very confused teenage pizza delivery guys asking for Hamspanics room! I beg your [WAT](http://i.imgur.com/zm1nctA.jpg)? Apparently

&gt;&gt;“You dumbasses don’t wsrblhbgbg how much whraagbladaspy me to stay alive warglaboslartibartfast just trying to kill me.” 

&gt;&gt;This was all happening right at shift change so the leaving nurse didn’t really want to deal with this and the arriving nurse especially didn't want to have to deal with the aftermath of the inevitable and [horribly literal shitstorm](http://youtu.be/8geLnpGmQAQ) 
to follow from the pizzas. 

&gt;&gt;Charge nurse comes in HFW and sees the pizza boxes. “You...can’t have these. You know this. You are a calorie restricted diet right now.”

&gt;&gt;Insert CPAP muffled fatlogic rant here. Finally says something to the effect of “These pizzas are for the family not for me

12 pizzas for 4 family members.

&gt;&gt;“Ma’am I am going to need them to take this to the cafeteria then. The smell is making some our sicker patients nauseous.”

&gt;&gt;“FAYNE!!!”

&gt;&gt;Family starts picking up the boxes. Charge nurse leaves the room.

&gt;&gt;Be me. Remotely monitoring patient vitals while trying to decipher shitty physician handwriting into life or death orders. Multitasking like a champ!

&gt;&gt;All of a sudden the screen starts going off like a Chinese new year and the expensive machine to my left whose only job is to go “Ping” is loudly going “Ping.”

Of course It’s Hamspanics room.

&gt;&gt;Rush in for a vitals signs check because her oxygen sats are dropping on my monitor that are beyond brain damage levels (30-40% O2 sats) and her heart is throwing PVC’s left and right.

&gt;&gt;She has thrown her CPAP completely across the room and [was trying to eat as many pizzas](http://i.imgur.com/BKPVwze) (not pieces) 
as she could before the lack of oxygen made her blackout. 

&gt;&gt;Family wasn’t helping her and had the pizza boxes open on top of her and were stuffing their own faces...like she was a giant semi sentient slug buffet table. [David Lynch](http://i.imgur.com/J4eNR5o.gif) couldn't have come up with a more surreal scene.

&gt;&gt;She looks like a giant greasy blueberry from the oxygen deprivation and absolutely stank like rusty meat. 

She is [literally starting to die](http://i.imgur.com/l9tL34n.gif) from lack of oxygen. 

&gt;&gt;Rush over to her and [slap the pizza out of her hand](http://i.imgur.com/dnobzwj.gif) and try to put the CPAP over her [head](http://i.imgur.com/3JqqA1W.gif). Her [dark beady little eyes narrow](http://i.imgur.com/kkxcUk1.gif). 


&gt;&gt;Then she starts bitching about the last pizza box that she [HAS to get to](http://i.imgur.com/W3BVVzA). 

For those of you that do that whole math thing

&gt;&gt;All of this happened in about 45 seconds.

.

(Sorry about all of the gifs

.

&gt;&gt;Several nurses are in the room at this point trying to figure out WTF is going on here.

&gt;&gt;Dr is called to come in and is PISSED. Increases the calorie amount of her restricted calorie diet up to 1800-2000 to try to appease her. 

&gt;&gt;She starts [yelling](http://i.imgur.com/Ca61dV5.gif) so loud that the other patients have started calling in concerned about it. Tries his hardest to explain the situation using his decades worth of medical experience.
 
&gt;&gt;Dude erases the patient information whiteboard to try to draw diagrams for the family about how she will die if she does this again and will die very

No...one...fucking...blinks.

&gt;&gt;Then it dawns on him. They knew. And they just didn’t care. This had already happened once before to her sister.

&gt;&gt;Tells the family to leave immediately. They comply...but only until the next morning.


&gt;&gt;[Dr leaves](http://i.imgur.com/pDwmZBC.gif). 
He has been defeated by the fatlogic.

&gt;&gt;10 minutes later over the intercom I hear the all too familiar [“Yooooooohoooooo! Hay booooooyyyyyyzzzzz.](http://i.imgur.com/65PXmJe.gif) Come scratch muh [kittay](http://i.imgur.com/CkegT6s.gif)!” 

&gt;&gt;The meat lovers pizza must have cleaned her out...[shit](http://i.imgur.com/OGOgfdm.gif).

**TL:DR Hamspanic patient was unsatisfied with restricted calorie diet. Almost kills herself trying to eat 12 meatlovers pizzas by taking off her CPAP.**

It had been a few months’ time since I had found myself occupying my ‘office’ at the job center—I had even managed to sneak a few personal items in to liven up the space. Truly, as beggars cannot be choosers—I attempted to do what I could to keep the place from looking too much like Hannibal’s basement.

Regardless of its soul-crushing bleakness and ice cold concrete flooring,’ you too would have gladly shaved your head bald in true Mr. Clean fashion out of respect.

Cleanliness like this doesn’t just happen out of serendipity—oh no

I slowly became increasingly curious as to the force at work behind my office’s spotlessness. “Maybe a dimensional vortex only interested in crumbs and dust opens above my desk each night?” I pondered. 

As I began my quest to unravel the mystery behind the miraculous marvels of cleanliness

My search for the janitorial staff had come up empty, outsourced their janitorial needs to a third-party company.

Upon hearing this

While I had located their homepage and company information with little to no trouble—the real trouble began when I read their hiring and employment policy. In essence

They what?

Now, a workforce of nothing but ex-felons? This company had taken progressive thinking to a level I thought possible only in the wet dreams of the liberal left’s most seasoned bleeding hearts.

It was all beginning to click…we were a job center that helped those who needed it—thus I reasoned it was a mark of good faith to employ a workforce who likewise needed help.

I knew what must be done; I must thank this unknown soldier of the custodial arts for their continued service and let them know that I appreciated all that they did for me.

Eventually

Now

I swear to this day that I had crossed my phone number off the back of that card

However

At around 10:30PM that damp November evening I awoke from a comfy-couch and history channel induced stupor to the sound of my cell phone’s vibration. I puzzled at the unknown number flashing across the screen

The voice on the other side was like nothing I had ever heard before in my life. The deep vibrations of its gurgling voice pushed the tiny speaker of my phone well beyond its functional limits—miraculously it sputtered out a barely understandable

I cannot say for sure whether it was curiosity or the instinctual rush of fight or flight adrenaline my body received upon hearing the beast’s hungry grunts that forced me to reply—but nevertheless I choked out a

The answer to my inquiry was met with

“Kuetreece who?” I stammered as my hands grew clammy.

“Kuetreece yo janitor Kuetreece

Never before in my life had my jaw more desperately fought against my facial muscles in an attempt to hit the floor. The wheel in my head was still spinning furiously

Luckily for me, I gots a man tho jus so yah no.” 

What……? Had she mistook my simple thank you as a confession of love!? I immediately began a feeble attempt at backstroking in a struggle to gain a conversational foothold once more.

“I just wanted to thank you

She didn’t let me finish my sentence and interjected

Once again my jaw pummeled my knees during its immediate suicide dive towards the ground, but I certainly wouldn’t be watching you clean even if there was.”

“Oh dats how you want to play this, a relief akin to that of the man who just found out he was not the father on Jerry Springer.

I sat in shocked silence on my couch in a stupor. What had just happened? No matter how many times I re-ran the conversation through in my mind

As I entered work the following morning with bags under my eyes, she works the night shift—I’m fine.

My eight hour shift passed by slower than a Rascal scooter with a flat tire

As fate would have it though

Sitting in my ‘office’ with the door closed between ‘clients’ was my only reprieve during the day

I immediately sensed something was very wrong—my boss never came to talk to me directly

If I may pause for a second to describe my boss, but after a disastrous knee injury and a few divorces, he had let the weight catch up with him, but he was still strong enough that no one gave him flak for his size.

“Onikakushi, almost anything he said above a whisper echoed and boomed regardless of intent). 

“What is it Sir? It’s rather rare for you to visit me during the day like this; I could have come to your office…” I stated as politely as I could

“One of the night-shift janitorial staff is filing a sexual harassment claim against you

The what?

“Sir,” my brain had ceased functioning.

“Well,” he growled as he turned about-face and headed towards his office.

My body felt heavy. It felt as though each of his words had attached a hamplanet to my individual limbs that I was now forced to drag along with me. I can only assume as I made my way to his office that my staggering frame must have resembled a reject from Michael Jackson’s Thriller video.

It wasn’t until I had fully entered his office that I finally saw her—although I take moral offence at being forced to prescribe her a gender. Although my previous encounter with Shadynasty had introduced me to the existence of planetary beings, indeed she even had the great bulging red storm spot on her left cheek. Her arms and midsection teetered outwards into an elliptical form resembling Saturn’s rings and she covered her immense girth with pieces of clothing that wept harder than the starving children who were forced to sew them. While all these features spoke for themselves and told a story more disturbing than any I’d ever read, her horrible neon blue hair was the last straw—I needed to puke. Now.

Unfortunately, I GOTS A MAN U KNEW DAT WHY YOU LEAVIN ME LOVE NOTES!?”

“But

“OH YES YOU DID

“OH BABY YOU SO SEXY WASHING MY DESK

This whale had fabricated a love note and used my business card as a means by which to have my name to sign to it. I didn’t even know what to do—this monster had failed to even use the same size of paper as I had for this falsified note.

But before I had a chance to propose a defense for myself

She opened it and showed my boss the call log

My God. I was done for.

I felt the sensation of falling in my gut

“Sir,” I crossed my fingers and hoped he would go for it.

“Good point

The adrenaline and fury was flowing through my veins at this point

Between her gasps for breath she attempted to keep pace with the two of us and continued to ramble on about how she was going to sue

We watched the videos from the night in question and my story was confirmed—it was at this point that she had a meltdown of truly galactic proportions.

“THAT’S FAKE

My boss was not having it; he called the security guards immediately and had her taken out—forcibly. 

As a brief side note: on her way out she had dropped my ‘love letter

After she had been jettisoned from the building, I’ll only tell you once—never thank these fuckers for anything. You give them an inch and they’ll take your life, that’s how they live—on the backs of anyone innocent enough to give them the time of day.”

I began to reply when he continued

And go to the gym he did—during the next few months he had dropped roughly 50lbs and was in much better shape than he had been for (according to him) since he was playing football.

In the end

Following this incident

**TL;DR – An odd obsession with cleanliness leads me on a whaling excursion gone horribly wrong. I nearly drown in the fat sea until my boss uses the spear gun to save me from an early gravy whilst saving himself from planetary status simultaneously.**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A light from the heavens shone down upon me

**LISTEN! Can you hear the rustling jimmies?** And I said, YES, O Great Beetus in the sky, I can hear those planets a feedin'.

And so the Great Beetus commandeth unto me, awful conditions, TO LAY TO REST the deathly rustlin of Jimmies.

The Great Beetus commanded unto me to tell you of the vengeance that the Great Beetus commanded of me

Hold on to your insulin, of relationships, of intrigue... of TWITCHING, and of beady eyed fat logic.

And so we begin.

&gt;If you wish to read the original text in crazy biblical text

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of Spouse-a-tron's and my Tenancy Agreement mentions that Landlady gets ultimate veto over our guests. Landlady during college was forced to pay a ridiculous sum of money to pay for damages that crazy dust snorting flatmate caused to flat. This rule is ok with us because we're getting mega cheap rent in exchange for some extra rules in the agreement

&gt;did not yet realise that Beetus was a fucking psycho.

Anyway. Spouse-a-tron gets a call from mum saying she's bringing two siblings with her down to the city (from their tiny ass village) to do some stuff and visit. Spouse-a-tron being at work when he gets this, I'm happy to make some for you, but some personal family shit is going to get discussed and could you give us some space for a night?""

Beetus doesn't hear that, and intending to stay past last trains and last bus.

We come home to find the front room is completely invaded, Blinky, Twitch, Hippy and Hippy's beta BF who never says anything. 

&gt;[OFW](http://i.imgur.com/6p24o8P.gif)

&gt;We're real sick of this shit

""Oh hey Beetus

Beetus loudly declares that he's a strong independent hamplanet who don't need no man.

&gt;beepbeep.mp3

**""See I can have a party too. I have *friends*.""** Beetus declares loudly. His friends look uncomfortable.

Spouse-a-tron tactfully takes mum and siblings upstairs to settle in.

""Ok

Beetus refuses to leave. His friends are staying all night

""What the hell dude, and other sibling is crashing on the couch.""

Beetus is displeased. **""NO, MY FRIENZ WERE HERE FIRST.""**

Beetus's friends are looking uncomfortable with this discussion. They all quickly leave with the excuse of ""I..uh...have to shampoo my cat."" And so they rush out the door. Beetus is in a fine rage, he comes down and removes me, wordlessly clears up Beetus's game and puts it carefully away, and then tells him to get out.

Beetus runs away

I may have been denied revenge then and there, putting them in places he'd never look (A lot of low drawers because he had trouble bending over with his fat ass stomach) and by carefully removing the spray nozzle and label from his axe body spray onto a canister of fabreze, which actually alleviated the smell until he ran out.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And yea Landlady spake unto Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla, as long as you follow My rules."" And there was much rejoicing in the House of Landlady, for Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla did get very cheep rentz. Landlady had writ unto the tenancy agreement these three rules, laws of of the House of Landlady, for all those who righteously live in the House of the Landlady to follow.



&gt;Firstly, that there be no shoes on in the House of Landlady, for the carpets were new, and besides, slippers are much comfier, yo. And there was much rejoicing, for chesZilla had many pairs of comfy warm slippers with which to protect the new Carpets in the House of Landlady, Landlady spake most harshly



But there was much rejoicings from Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla


&gt;Yeah I know Beetus was a fucking nutjob but we didn't find that out until well after he'd moved in



And all was well within the House.  But in the House resided the one known as Billyum Beetus. And he sent by the Great Beetus




&gt;One day the family of Spouse-a-tron, and they did call on the cellular phones, and make arrangements. ChesZilla did seek permission from Landlady, as was writ in the Agreement of the Tenancy,  and Landlady did approve the family of Spouse-a-tron coming to visit and staying in the House. For Spouse-a-tron was at work, chesZilla was tasked with informing Beetus. Beetus, in rare display of actually acknowledging the presence of a mere woman such as misheard everything.




""Just a heads up, we'll need the front room for big family dinner."" Was misheard by Beetus, and he thought she had said ""Yea until me, my posh frienz will come over for rollicking good times and a soiree, and I inform you for you are not among the Invited."" Beetus's eyes did narrow into suspicious beady slits, as he contemplated ruining the plans of Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla. This he did for he felt it was divine retribution for not paying homage to his Great Beetusness.



&gt;While Spouse-a-tron and chesZilla met the family from the Bus Station, Blinky, Twitch, Hippy and Hippy's beta BF who never says anything. And Beetus did invite them over from all the corners of Glasgow without permission or even consulting with the other members of the House. In the Front Room, he covered the Dining Table, the only table capable of seating more than one person, with games of intricacy and delicate rules. And he invited his five 'acquaintances' to join with him in a celebration of tabletop games.



Upon returning home, making a face such as [this.](http://i.imgur.com/6p24o8P.gif) For they were both real tired of his shit. And Beetus spake unto the House members **""See I can have a party too. I have *friends*.""** Spouse-a-tron tactfully removed his family out of the line of fire, for he could tell chesZilla was about to lose her cool. And chesZilla did spake unto Beetus: ""Oh having a games night? Are you wrapping up soon? I'm about to start dinner for Spouse-a-tron's family, and we need the big table. Perhaps you can move upstairs?""


&gt;Beetus, because it is a game night, and we wish to play games all night. Because they have come from the farthest corners of Glasgow, they are staying here for the gaming shall run very late indeed.""** And chesZilla was so enraged by these words, that she did 'blow up at him'. ""Beetus, that's really insensitive, for we did tell you we had visitors on this night, for he was a douche canoe. **""If You can throw a party, for they had forgotten to shampoo their cats.

Beetus was enraged, so that I will kill myself. That is what you want.""** And chesZilla was mightily confused with his fatlogic.

&gt;And Spouse-a-tron, to remove chesZilla from the room, before she did tear Beetus's fat stupid face off his skull. But chersZilla was not satisfied, for she did switch all of Beetus's games around to different cases, and hid his favourite JRPGs in secret places. Beetus was much irritated by this, for he could not sing his jPRG pop songs anymore. And chesZilla did carefully swap the spray nozzle and label of his axe body spray with a canister of fabreze, and the atrocious smell was alleviated briefly. Until he ran out.

**TL;DR**

Beetus decides ""family visiting"" means PARTAY and that same day invites five people he only kind of knows, he claims it is because I do not want him to have fun and am trying to control him because I am insecure about not having friends.

&gt;""Excuse me?"" I Interrupt her and ask her what she meant by that.


&gt;She turns to me with a big smile on her face. ""You see this? I drew this. This is going to gurantee me the job!"" I look down at her drawing and greated by... typical anime weeaboo fanart crap. 


&gt;I just stare and comment on it. Saying the anatomy of the person is messed up


&gt;""Don't you recognize her? ITS ME!"" She says with a smile on her face. I'm a bit flabbergasted at the moment. She is submitting that for a job interview? 


&gt;I look at it again and notice the character is really familiar... ""Isn't that Nana from the manga?""


&gt;She rips the paper from my hand before I can say anymore and scoffs at me. ""Skinny cunt."" She says to me.


&gt;I just ignore her at this part. Be the bigger girl (lol) and try not to reduce myself to her level. I keep hearing a noise though and begin looking for it. As I turn around I see her KICKING my portfolio. 


&gt; I Kept it between the seats to avoid this kind of thing


&gt;""Please stop that"" I ask and all she does is smile at me.


&gt;A pretty attractive secratary comes out of the office and begins 
calling people by name. The first guy enters and leaves fairly quickly same with the second


&gt;I'm next and I go into the office with my portfolio. Boss Guy has a quick look at it and nods


fuckyes.gif


&gt;Hambeast is called in next and she just waddles in. I didn't notice it before but.. the fuck is she wearing? She is wearing an extremely tight hoodie, and a skirt? What? Her ankles though look swollen as fuck.


&gt;She comes out fairly quickly with a huge ass smile on her face. As she sits next to me she just bends over and says ""See that? The moment they got a look at my curves they knew who to hire. Goodluck in the soup kitchen you anorexic  bitch. 


&gt;I ask her if they asked for another interview. She just smiled and said ""They didn't need to. As soon as they saw me


&gt;The bossguy comes out with the rest of his crew. ""You all have interesting art


&gt;Boss pulls down a piece of paper. Says my name


&gt;Bossguy smiles and says That will be all and will the names I called please follow me.


&gt;Hambeast isn't having any of this. ""Excuse me?"" She shouts at him ""I believe you missed a name."" 


&gt;Boss guy looks over her and just smiles and says ""I believe I haven't."" Didn't even look at the list. Hambeast is furious.


&gt;She shouts at them ""Excuse me? You can't honestly believe that these anorexic cunts deserve it more than I do?"" Bossguy turns again and says ""I believe they do


&gt;As he begins walking out she marches over to my portfolio case which I'm carrying and grabs it


&gt;""CALL SECRUITY NOW!"" Bossguy screams at one of his secrartarys. 


&gt;""You are discriminating against me! I'll sue you for everything you have!"" Hambeast is shouting at them as is kicking around my portfolio. 


&gt;i'm stunned by all this


&gt;Hoodie girl is standing there doing nothing. Guy B is just laughing.


&gt;Secruity finally makes it up and grabs Hambeast by her arms and begin dragging her away. I can hear both of them going ""Urgh.."" as they forcefully pull her away.


&gt;She keeps shouting ""Don't you know who I am? I'm going to be bigger than anyone even INSERT JAPANESE NAME HERE"" 


&gt;The boss guy looks a bit flustered and asked to check if my portfolio is ok. I let him take a look and he says looks fine. The bag I use is damn sturdy. 


&gt;We all enter the room and we are scheduled for our next interview and given a job. He says if our work is accepted you will be paid


I never found out what happened to Hambeast, and my personal favorite ""FAT ACCEPTANCE WILL WIN"" was the last thing I heard from her.

1368116468.0,1e0bhh,Too heavy for an electric shopping cart,None4GretchenWieners,540,108,132,"Well would you look at that

WARNING: Buckle up them jimmies

This story comes from my retail days

Back story: There was this girl I knew in high school, 5'7”, 120lbs) would be in my store a few times a week buying her own food because her lard-beast of a mother, who we'll call Scootercunt, absolutely refused to buy the foods that Sophia wanted. Now, we're going to clear this up right now, Sophia ate like I did at that time, vegetables, organic peanut butter, (who was 5'0” and when I first met her she was pushing 350lbs)

Now on to the story...

Be me, and my guess is she was pushing 400lbs at that point. Sophia comes in behind her with a normal cart and sets off to do her shopping. Scootercunt heads toward her motorized throne and plops her ass down on it. She sits there for 5 minutes but doesn't move. I am slightly confused for a second, then remember the carts have a weight limit of like 375lbs. Scootercunt yells to me that the cart isn't working and gets off. I sit down on the cart (it only turned on when someone was sitting on it, the set itself is a scale) and show her that the cart does in fact work. I get off and Scootercunt gets back on, and again, the cart won't move. Scootercunt is now yelling and cursing that the cart isn't working, and of course Sophia, hears and comes over.

Sophia: “Ma

Scooterbeast: “I only weigh 350! This cart must be broken!”

Sophia: “Bullshit Ma

Scooterbeast starts yelling and cursing again, and leaves. Sophia fucking walked a mile and a half home with her groceries because her mom was making a scene. At this point, a lot of people (both customers and employees) are very annoyed with Scootercunt and my boss calls the police. When the police get there, they tell her to leave because she is creating a huge scene and disrupting the peace. Scootercunt becomes quiet, and looks like she's about to cry. She squeezes back off the cart looks over at me, and asks where Sophia is. I shrug and tell her she walked home. Scootercunt starts yelling again, but stops when a cop pulls out his taser. Scootercunt ends up just leaving

TL;DR Fruits &amp; veggies are bad

Epilogue: Sophia ended up moving out of her mother's place on her 18th birthday. She just couldn't tolerate living in a sea of filth and fatlogic any longer, and I completely agree with that. I have more fat people stories that involve Sophia, I promise to post those at some point in time.

1372809014.0,1hj6dv,Slowbro and Jigglybitch II- CARRY ME!,wtfitsaries,547,109,43,"Part II (Part I is [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hiyt1/the_love_saga_of_jigglebitch_and_slowbro/) way)

I find out

OG tells me about how when they lived together she would “forget OG was home” and sit on the couch in nothing but her bra/panties. Or, claiming she picked the wrong door. She also didn’t pay any bills, her only contribution to the household was her foodstamps, which she got for being on disability. She’s only 17. She has.. yeah, you guessed it, a “condition”. So, on the first of each month, and used her disability check to buy however much beer. Which would be okay

The last straw was when Slowbro was “taking up too much bed” so she crawled naked (or nearly naked, and moved out that night. (but that’s a story for another time).

Now

&gt;nooooooooo.mp3

 It’s starting to get dark at the lake, enjoying the music. We know most of these people from high school, and end up in a decent size group once everyone migrated towards the water. Slowbro and Jigglybitch were about 10 feet away in the water, she was still running her mouth about me and OG. 

&gt;Slowbro- “Blahblahblah, blahblahblah”

&gt;Pretty sure he’s just trying to avoid getting eaten. 

&gt;Whatever

&gt; One of OG and I’s mutual friends from high school [let’s call her bandgirl] came up and commented on how great I look

&gt;  I tell her it’s just from working and being so busy

&gt; OG says something about how it’s a miracle I eat ever since I’m so forgetful. Obviously joking. 

&gt; “SNORT. YEAH LOOK AT THAT GUT

&gt;Bandgirl looks over at jigglybitch

&gt; I tell her to ignore the beast

&gt;Jigglybitch doesn’t like to be ignored. Talks shit even louder to Slowbro. 

&gt;At this point most of us had had a few beers. 

&gt;Someone suggested we play chicken. (the version where you get one someones shoulders

&gt;So about 8 of us go out into the water

&gt;My turn
 
&gt; “MY TURN MY TURN! I WANNA PLAAAAAAAY!”

&gt;Some random person “Okay

&gt; she looks at slowbro.

&gt; he tells her he can’t

&gt;lolok.

&gt;She’s pissed

&gt;Go figure

&gt;We continue with our game

&gt;About 20 minutes later

&gt;Drunkguy gets out to pay the pizza man. 

&gt;Pizza man is actually more like pizza kid. Maybe 16. Scrawny.

&gt;JB mysteriously vanished

&gt;drunkguy ordered 3 large pizza’s.. pizza kid only has 2. 

&gt;Receipt says 3.

&gt;Pizza kid said that Jigglybitch took one when she sent him over. Said it was hers..

&gt;Drunkguy is PISSED.

&gt;Poor pizza kid realizes his mistake

&gt;it’s cool

&gt;We all look for Jigglybitch. Find empty pizza box on hood of car. 

&gt;She ate a large supreme pizza in under 10 minutes.

&gt;Well

&gt;Drunkguy

&gt;Someone spots JB sitting on the edge of the lake. She has the last 1/4th of the pizza folded up and is working on stuffing it in her face.

&gt;Drunk guy walks up and slaps the pizza into the lake. She scrambles for it

&gt; “No bitch

&gt; “MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW

&gt;Drunkguy doesn’t give a shit.

&gt; “I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR EVERYONE”

&gt;”So you ate a whole pizza?”

&gt; “I HAVE A CONDITION!”

&gt;Enter slowbro

&gt; “HMMPH!”

&gt;We all go on with ignoring her.

Remember how Jigglybitch doesn’t like being ignored?

&gt;OG and one of his buddies had swam out to the end of the dock to talk vidya games or something. 

&gt;I am sitting on the beach

&gt;Jigglybitch locks on to her target

&gt;I see it all happening in slow motion.. too far away to stop it.

&gt;It’s dark

&gt;Jigglybitch launches herself at OG “teehee CARRY ME! teehee” 


Thank god that he had good footing


&gt;Jigglybitch had her flabby limbs wrapped around him. No intention of letting go.

&gt; OG

&gt; “teehee DON’T BE SILLY OG

&gt; OG- “She’s like half your fucking size get off.”

&gt; “teehee! YOU’RE CARRYING ME JUST FINE


OG was done. No more playing even remotely nice. Everyone had stopped what they were doing to see what the hell was going on.


&gt; OG- “GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME! I DON’T WANT TO FEEL YOUR SKINFLAPS ON MY BACK

&gt;Everyone’s silent. 

&gt;I laugh. 

&gt;JB looks stunned

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST ACTING LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOUR BITCH OF A GIRLFRIEND IS HERE. WE BOTH KNOW YOU WANT ME.”


It’s like a trainwreck in slow motion


&gt;OG “I don’t want you. I don’t want anything to fucking do with you. You’re pathetic and disgusting and I don’t see why SlowBro puts up with your shit!

&gt;JB starts crying

&gt;Car disappears

&gt;Everyone else at the lake is laughing. Tears were shed. 

&gt;Someone shows up with more beer. All is forgotten.

&gt;OG and I sit and enjoy the rest of our evening

Day two of new job begins and I took your advice and reported FAT.

Happily ever after! Right?

No.

As it turns out

The director was angry and told me that I have to be nice to FAT or I should start looking for a new job. The director said 'I'm very disappointed in you that you would be so rude to someone

Note the director is not a small lady herself

After getting chewed out

I walked in to see FAT engaging in mass consumption (surprise!) 

We had eye contact. She smiled and in that moment, more than Umbridge from Harry Potter, more than sitting on a cold toilet seat in the middle of winter. I decided to pretend nothing was wrong and that nothing had happened. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she had gotten me in trouble. So I went about business and watched her eat.

Breakfast was 2 sasuage egg McMuffins

That was yesterday. Today. Oh today. Today takes the cake. 

Today the munchkins were all making little crowns to wear because we were putting on a parade after lunch. They made their crowns

Today was a special lunch for the munchkins

They stared eating

'Hey teacher!'

'Yeah

'I think the kids would *love* Cool Whip on their strawberries!'

'Go for it.' Replied the teacher.

So I did the unthinkable and stole a planets food. Her whip was in the fridge

She opened the fridge stared in disbelief and then looked up. Comprehension dawned upon her

She said nothing, we put them down for their naps. I was feeling hungry, and I knew there was about 10-12 grilled cheese sandwiches left, so I was surprised when I turned around and there were none left.

I looked over to FAT sitting in the corner. She had 8 sandwiched piled in front of her and was going to town. I walked over and tried to grab a sandwich. Her hand shot out and slapped mine away.


FAT 'Oh look

Me 'That cool whip was enough for 50 campers. Don't you think it's a little much to be eaten straight? How do you not feel sick? I'd throw up.'

FAT 'I'm sure you do that anyway.'

That hurt, it is still a touchy subject for me. 

So I quickly grabbed half of a sandwich and jumped back before she could grab me again

That is until later when I walked out and found a couple 2 liter bottles of Coke next to my car. They were empty and had been poured all over my car

I wonder who did it.",self,t5_2vzax,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hky3u/cool_whip_is_healthy_part_2/

&gt;NOOOOO YUH JUST WAHNT ME TO GO WITH THEH SLOW KIDS

&gt;kinda

&gt;but oh god don't say that

&gt;whateverwhateverwhatever

&gt;Bertha eventually gets out and lies down on deck

&gt;LIES DOWN

&gt;WHERE PEOPLE ARE WALKING

&gt;Don't deal with her for the rest of warm ups

&gt;Bertha yells at people asking her to move while everyone finishes swimming

&gt;lazyfatbitch

&gt;get out of pool

&gt;full of delicious fuel for me

&gt;at least 70 bucks worth of stuff ranging from Gatorade to power bars to bagels

&gt;pull out some Gatorade for pre-race snack

&gt;briefly salivate over food set aside for post-race

&gt;close backpack and stow under benches

&gt;get ready for race

&gt;Bertha mysteriously not present on deck

&gt;likeIcare

&gt;finish race with flying colors

&gt;ready to dig into that backpack!

&gt;head over to benches

&gt;where the fuck is backpack

&gt;it's gone

&gt;no trace left

&gt;search under benches

&gt;search surrounding area

&gt;what the actual fuck

&gt;ask around to see if anyone has seen it

&gt;no one has any idea

&gt;they saw Bertha take it after I left

&gt;oh hell naw

&gt;ask everyone if they've seen Bertha

&gt;she's in the bleachers eating

&gt;eating

&gt;EATING

&gt;oh god no

&gt;please let this not be what it looks like

&gt;head up to bleachers with Skinnybro and Hairbro

&gt;tired as fuck from race

&gt;spot Bertha

&gt;mid-bite into a bagel

&gt;slathered in cream cheese

&gt;holding my backpack

&gt;OH HELL NO

&gt;stomp up to where she's sitting in bleachers

&gt;Skinnybro and Hairbro flanking

&gt;what the fuck do you think you're doing eating my food

&gt;AH WAS HUNGREH AFTA WARM UPS AND WANTED A SNACK TEEHEE

&gt;continues eating bagel

&gt;I snatch my backpack out of her porky paws

&gt;it's full of fucking wrappers

&gt;there's nothing left

&gt;eyes start clouding over

&gt;everything turns red

&gt;this bitch just mowed down 70 bucks of food I bought for myself in the 15 minutes I left it alone 

&gt;Skinnybro asks if the bagel she's eating came from my bag

&gt;says yes between bites

&gt;spits MY BAGEL all over the place while she talks

&gt;Hairbro asks if there's any food left

&gt;WEEELL THUR WASN'T MUCH TO START WITH AND AH NEEDED A SNACK

&gt;Initiate blackout rage mode

&gt;start going off about how much of an asshole she is

&gt;throw a handful of wrappers at her from backpack

&gt;ask if she had any idea how much that food cost

&gt;IT WAS JURST A SNACK OKAY?

&gt;no no no no not okay

&gt;never okay

&gt;say she's a dumb fatass who can't control herself

&gt;say she's no better than a dumb animal

&gt;Bertha starts blubbering and wailing

&gt;storm off

&gt;take backpack and go to the benches

&gt;sit and wait for next race

&gt;10 events away (long enough to be boring but too short to go get food)

&gt;Coach comes up to me

&gt;so...uh.... Bertha says you were bullying her

&gt;see Bertha coyly trying to ""hide"" behind coach

&gt;fat exposed on both sides

&gt;has shit eating grin on her porky red face

&gt;THAS RIGHT

&gt;is this true

&gt;I nod

&gt;it was true

&gt;more or less

&gt;coach continues

&gt;Bertha says you were making fun of her weight

&gt;nod again

&gt;you know Fishman

&gt;yessir

&gt;now please apologize to Bertha

&gt;shes been standing there this whole time with that stupid smile

&gt;switches to ""oh woe is me"" face as coach turns around

&gt;YEH FISHMAN APOLOGIZE

okay quick break just to clarify

&gt;I don't think so

&gt;coach sighs and rolls eyes

&gt;Why not

&gt;I only yelled at her because she ate all of my food

&gt;coach looks at Bertha. Starting to realize something is up

&gt;bitch is in shock

&gt;people don't usually stand up to her for fear of getting in trouble with the higher ups

&gt;so

&gt;Bertha knows the tides have turned

&gt;screws up her face and starts wailing

&gt;FISHMAN IS SUH MEEEEAN

&gt;HE'S ALWAYS CALLIN MEH FAAAAAT

&gt;HE DOESN'T KNOW HUW HAAAARHD AH HAVE IT

&gt;AH HAVE A COMDITIOOOON

&gt;HE'S SO SKINNY WHAAYS HE NEED ALL THAT FOOD

&gt;HE WERSNT GURNNA EAT IT ALL ANNERWEH

&gt;mfw she's talking about all the snacks I brought for a 3 day meet

&gt;coach is looking at me like ""sorry man not much I can do""

&gt;I glare at Bertha

&gt;stare into her twisted

&gt;notgonnaapologize

&gt;coach tells me again to just do it

&gt;nope

&gt;Wordlessly hand him the backpack full of wrappers

&gt;coach's eyes get wide

&gt;Bertha

&gt;AH WAS HUNGREH AND FISHMAN WASN'T EATING IT ANYWAY

&gt;coach looks through backpack with a mixture of amazement and disgust

&gt;looks at me like he's seen a ghost

&gt;a fatass monster of a ghost

&gt;How much did this cost

&gt;Tell him like 70 bucks

&gt;coach looks back at Bertha

&gt;Confusion and annoyance replaced by fiery anger rivaling that of a hundred fatties denied second breakfast

&gt;you ate 70 bucks worth of Fishmans food without asking?!?

&gt;Berthas lip begins to tremble

&gt;sends shockwaves rippling through her chins

&gt;AH WAS JURST HUNGREH

&gt;STOP PICKEN ON MEH

&gt;coach stares at the backpack

&gt;looks back at Bertha

&gt;visibly shaking

&gt;even I'm a little afraid of coach in a bad mood

&gt;eyes full of fury

&gt;Bertha

&gt;AH ATE IT EARLIYAH

&gt;hfw he realizes she was eating before warmups

&gt;Must've been what she was doing in the bleachers

&gt;explains why she was having so much trouble swimming

&gt;coach has no words

&gt;none at all

&gt;tells her I don't have to apologize

&gt;tells her that she has to pay me back

&gt;sweet success

&gt;too sweet

&gt;MAH DADDY GONNA HUR ABOUT THIS

&gt;turns away and waddles furiously up to bleachers where papa whale sitting

&gt;fat rolls jiggle as she trundles up steps

&gt;starts crying and gesticulating wildly at papa whale

&gt;I watch in horror as papa whale attempts to get up

&gt;bastard must be at least 450 lbs

&gt;barely mobile

&gt;no idea how he even got up there

&gt;takes 10 minutes to get off the bleachers

&gt;wish I was kidding

&gt;papa whale yells at the coach to come over to him by the bleachers

&gt;coach refuses

&gt;Kinda not true but papa whale don't know shit

&gt;papa whale rests for a couple minutes before making his way over

&gt;I dip out

&gt;lolnope I wish

&gt;fuckmylife

&gt;Bertha repeats her sob story

&gt;wants me to be kicked off the team

&gt;demands I apologize and grovel at her feet

&gt;coach rolls eyes so much I'm afraid they'll fall out

&gt;everyone else on the team is watching now

&gt;papa whale nods along with everything Bertha says

&gt;interjects occasionally with ""that's right sweetie""

&gt;oh did I mention he took one of the chairs someone had been sitting on, swim stuff) and onto the wet ground

&gt;everyone else on the team now staring intently

&gt;person whose stuff got thrown on the ground glaring so hard they haven't blinked

&gt;Bertha starts bitching about how I've made a scene

&gt;FISHMAN JURST WANTS TER EMBURUSS MEH

&gt;at this point I'm ready to apologize just to get it over with

&gt;papa whale will have none of it

&gt;tells coach either they kick me off the team or Bertha and her siblings quit

&gt;coach completely silent

&gt;everyone hoping they quit

&gt;papa whale realizes he has no leverage as goes for a different angle

&gt;says he'll call the school get coach in trouble

&gt;coach just doesn't answer

&gt;suddenly comes back to reality

&gt;Fishman

&gt;yeah

&gt;they've been watching the whole time

&gt;other kids on the team back them up

&gt;Bertha goes full on ballistic

&gt;YER ALL JURST BULLIES

&gt;YUH PEOPLE AH MEAN TO ME CAUZ AHM DIFFURNT

&gt;FISHMAN IS JURST MAD BECAZ HE HAS A CRUSH ON ME BUT AHM TOO GOOD FOR HIM

&gt;what

&gt;aw hell no

&gt;everyone shaking their heads

&gt;no words

&gt;did she really just try that

&gt;it's starting to dawn on papa whale that this is a losing battle

&gt;struggles to pull himself off the chair he shanghaied

&gt;poor thing looks like it's been to hell and back

&gt;crumples shortly after he gets up

&gt;goodnight

&gt;papa whale motions for Bertha to follow

&gt;they both eventually make it up to the bleachers

&gt;papa whale gets out a duffle bag

&gt;oh have I mentioned that's food the coach banned us from eating at meets?

&gt;they both have a post-argument feast

&gt;gotta replenish dem calories burned up from walking 30 feet and talking

&gt;never got refunded on food

&gt;coach gets a call from the school a couple hours later

&gt;say they want to talk to me and are considering disciplinary action

&gt;coach told them he'd deal with it

&gt;says it's under control

&gt;tells me to not talk to Bertha for the rest of the meet

&gt;stay outta trouble

&gt;apologizes that he can't help more

&gt;she and papa whale end up leaving early anyway

&gt;They take the ferry home because papa whale can't do planes

&gt;Mfw it turns out she had no events and was only there because papa whale brought her

TL;DR: disgusting fatty and known instigator Bertha eats all 70 bucks worth of my friends food while he's racing, ends up leaving and calls the school to get my friend in trouble when they both realize no one's on their side

My criteria was ""attractive

Date one: I show up

She, but the rest of her was relatively normal-sized. I said I'd already eaten, so instead of eating food, we went for a walk. She repeatedly kept asking me to slow down in my walk- I wasn't walking fast, I wasn't even walking normal pace. I tried to shoot the shit and just take it easy, but it was apparently too much for her.

She sat down on a park bench. I remained standing. She patted the bench. ""You have to take a break sometimes, it won't be good for you, all this moving around.""

Wat.

I left shortly after.

**********

I went back home, but I didn't find her attractive.' I hoped that that was hint enough- no more fat chicks, please.

Date 2: Different girl. It was supposed to be a picnic at a park. She was about ten pounds lighter than the previous woman- one of those indeterminable ages

She was the only one at the park. I had called my old friend from grade school, when my phone went off. I told him I was 'on my way, don't drink anything, I'll bring the mop.'

She looked at me like a kicked puppy. ""I don't have a ride home.""

*Howthefuckdidyougethere.jpg*

""Okay, I've gotta go though.""

Her home was two blocks from the park.

Ok so the first story I gave you here was about Oiltank

&gt;Be me, slim, but carrying about 10lb cos its just been xmas guise, gimme a break :( 

&gt;Not be oiltank. Huge Scandinavian whale that got past the harpoons. Shitty personality

&gt;Not be Muffin and Icecube two hawt scandinavian guys who throw arrsum parties. 

&gt;Not be group of beautiful scandinavian women.
(notable three in this story are Whitewhine Toopretty and Zelda)

&gt;Not be assface. My bff's (then) bf. 

At this point, oh and turkish, she sometiems drags them to these parties and has awkward makeout sessions with them. 

&gt;Be at gym with beautiful sexy ladies
&gt;Oh and someone brought their pet elephant

Nawh it's cool

We're all working out because it's just been christmas and we are all pudgy. At least everyone is working out but oiltank. 

&gt;""GUISE WAIT I NEED A SNACK

The climb being the three flights of stairs to the gym. 
&gt;""HOW COME I GET SO FAT AFTER CHRISTMAS

&gt;implying that she wasn't fat before. 

&gt;""I'M NOT GOING TO DO WEIGHTS BECAUSE THEN I'LL BE ALL FREAKY AND MUSCULAR LIKE YOU

I am not muscular in the slightest. 

Everyone just kinda leaves her anyway and goes to get shit done. Muffin and Icecube have another glorious party planned so we wanna squeeze this workout in before getting beautimus (shut up you watch honey boo boo too

I have to take the cross trainer because my knees are fucked and treadmills are bad for this. Sadly you can easymode on a crosstrainer so I am stuck with oiltank. 

&gt;""PIPLUP THERE ARE GONNA BE SO MANY HOT GUYS THERE TONIGHT WHICH ONE SHALL I CHOOSE"" 

...&gt;implying that options will be open. 

&gt;""I dunno Oiltank

&gt;""TEEHEE PIPLUP THAT DOESN'T NARROW IT DOWN VERY MUCH""

She gets out a granola bar

She had four. oh well. 

At this point Whitewine walks over. Whitewine has a crush on Muffin. I'm close with Muffin and I know he likes her too. I have been a bit of a harry potter owl between the two, any show of affection has taken a big while to build up. GUESS WHAT OILTANK WANTS TO RUIN GUYS. 

Whitewine says hey, but whatevr, no one cares if the hambeast hears, right? 

&gt;""SO WHITEWINE ARE YOU GONNA SLUT ALL OVER MUFFIN LIKE YOU DID LAST PARTY"" 

Whitewine has never been slutty

&gt;""oh...um...I hope'd he be there..."" 

&gt;""YEAH ME TOO I'M GONNA BRING HIM HOME TONIGHT"" 

Whitewine looks like she's about to cry. I'm extremely alpha at this stage in my life. 

&gt;""No you won't Oiltank

&gt;""OH MY GOD PIPLUP HE'S A GUY. GUYS LIKE TO HAVE SEX. IF HE WANTED HER HE WOULD HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER"" 

&gt;""he's not like that Oiltank

Toopretty comes over and tells Oiltank to move her ass off the rowing machine cos she needs it. Toopretty is alpha and awesome

&gt;Toopretty - ""move your huge ass and sit on the floor then

Oiltank is smart

&gt;""OH OF COURSE TOOPRETTY

Yes, Oiltank has teeheed her way out of the room saying that she's done her workout for the day so she can run off and dress to impress Muffin. 

I'm left with Whitewine.

&gt;""Piplup
&gt;""Whitewine, just give him time, anyway he told me to tell you he can't wait to see you tonight"".


FAST FORWARD TO THE PARTAY. 

I am greeted with snuggles and stuff. I have used the sunny Mediterranean to warm the hearts of these vikings

I'm early cos I offer to help set up

I see Muffin

Unfortunately, self ripped fishnet tights and a ""corset"" (hot topic t shirt corset shit things) all in at least 4 sizes too small. Tasty. 

&gt;""OH MY GOD PIPLUP YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND

&gt;""shut up Oiltank I'm helping him pick cologne"" 

&gt;""IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU KNOW WHITEWINE LIKES HIM HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO HER YOU ARE SO CRUEL

Yeah, the second I get out of his room she SHOVES me aside and slams the door in my face. Think whatever, Muffin is an atheltic guy, he can handle himself if she gets nasty. 

Icecube throws a glowstick at my head and tells me he needs help with the glowsticks. Glowsticks are glowy and they distract me easily. Many people arrive, get tossed around more like a baby seal in a pack of attractive orcas, get more glowsticks dangerously close to my eyes, and then whitewine arrives. 

&gt;""hey piplup! is muffin still getting ready?"" 

Ohgodmuffin
oh god no where is he. 

&gt;Run to muffin's room
&gt;throw door open
&gt;why can't I unsee things

DON'T WORRY GUYS, sensible and rational manner. 

LoljkI'mspanish. 

&gt;""OILTANK WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. WHAT EVEN IS THIS"" 

She spins around and I am faced with two uneven mounds of white flab. The only mercy is that the nipples were pointing so far down I barely even saw them. 

&gt;""PUT SOME FUCKING CLOTHES ON"" 

&gt;""BUT PIPLUP HE TOLD ME HE WANTED ME AND THEN I TRIED TO TOUCH HIM AND HE LOCKED HIMSELF AWAY

Of course this draws attention and TooPretty storms in. The music must be mercifully loud as she shouts she only heard cos she's walking to the bathroom. She deals with this wailing whale better than I ever could. Without a word she stuffs Oiltanks clothes in to her hand

At this point I haven't consumed any fucking alcohol and it's only 10pm. How the fuck did this become my life. 

I get the fine job of talking to Oiltank, I go with her. I think that everyone needs to cool off a bit. 

Through bites of a huge kebab on the way back to the party

&gt;""YOU KNOW IF HE'D RAPED ME NO ONE WOULD CARE BECAUSE I'M FAT"" 

&gt;""Oiltank

&gt;""I DON'T NEED IT TO

That fucking race/fat comparison annoyed me so much

Muffin is out at this point, Whitewine notices and they're sat giggling and sharing a drink, she's kind of half sat on him. I miss my bf. INTERNAL SOBS. But seriously I'm really happy for them. Oiltank is staring daggers at them and notices I'm looking dreamily at them. 

She says to me in a really weird voice ""I'm going to tell him she's a whore

Massive quantities of alcohol are consumed, I have pillow fought strangers while riding on icecube's shoulders and so far nothing is broken. 

Then some turkish guy comes in. After general wtfing it all becomes blatantly clear. 
&gt;""OH MY GOOOOD TURKISHGUYYYYYYYYY!"" 

She like tongue kisses this random guy in front of everyone and then spends a load of time booty grinding this guy no one knows. She;s like dancing with him in front of Muffin

&gt;""HEEEEEYYYY MUFFIN

Turkish guy mumbles something
&gt;""not boyfriend

OH BOY this is gonna be good. 

&gt;""JUST IGNORE HIM

Oiltank then reaches down and like.. tickles turkishguy's crotch. Vomit. 

Whitewne must have had a grossed out look on her face because oiltank said this. 
&gt;""OH DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT WHITEWINE, WE ALL KNOW YOUVE BEEN AROUND EVERY GUY IN THIS ROOM, OH SORRY WAS I NOT MEANT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT TEEHEE"" 

Oiltank is told to stfu, she has PROOF that whitewine is a whore, and she pulls out her phone, and shows everyone a load of messages from a contact with whitewine's name, and thrusts it in to some guy's hand.

Whitewine begins to cry as these vulgar, and the house, crying :/ Toopretty goes after her, and tells Muffin to just let her sort it out. Sadly I don't see either again for the rest of the night. Muffin looks devastated and Oiltank looks triumphant. I can't contain myself

&gt;""YOU SPITEFUL FAT BITCH

&gt;""SHUT UP PIPLUP

Hear quiet response. What did you say Muffin?

&gt;""I said I wouldn't have sex with you if you were the last person on earth. Fuck this party"". 

Muffin, but that's not good enough for Oiltank. As Muffin is walking to his room she chases him, I follow, and she's about to grab his arm when.....

We see in to the spare room, Assface had always been the white knight for Oiltank. He knew things were going bad with my bff and was putting his eggs in other baskets. He would need someone to have sex with when they broke up, so he'd been leading Oiltank on. 

Oiltank drops all caring about Muffin. Assface

""ASSFACE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND"" 

Zelda jumps up and screams "" YOU HAVE A FUCKING GIRLFRIEND?"" 

&gt;""YES I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND"" 

Then who the fuck is that turkish guy eating all our pizza. 

Before assface can explain FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS EVENING

&gt;""I SAID THAT SO SHE WOULD LEAVE

Staying true to his backup plan assface is a shoulder to cry on. At this point I'm not fucking leaving them alone. This asshole is dating my best friend

She's crying about how if she were slim Muffin would want her, and it must be because she doesn't eat and she's so ""small"".

Assface tells her to sleep over. I tell assface I'm gonna ask muffin to sleep on his floor. I don't fucking trust him not to cheat on my bff. 

I then spend the whole night talking to Muffin til we fall asleep. He's really sad and disappointed and angry that he didn't run after Whitewine. It feels really weird to read back over these events and I wonder why we didn't do more to stop it happening. My only excuse is that we were really really drunk :(

**Chapter Fifteen**

We made our way to the restaurant without much incident, and the threat of an automobile accident seemed enough to keep Porcina largely in line. The conversation – dominated by the portly one – had ranged from manga to pornography, though any time a particularly racy subject had arisen, Porcina would playfully squeak “Oops!” and glance over her shoulder at Lauren.

I suspected that some ground rules had been laid

Towards the end of our journey, or maybe it was Porcina herself, but for whatever reason, the sexual comments and suggestive remarks evoked only apathy in me.

“Why don't you guys get out, and I don't want to make you guys walk.” If I'm honest, I had planned on Porcina's laziness coming into play, and I wasn't disappointed.

“Don't be *laaaaaaate*, and to my delight, Lauren decided to stay.

“I'll keep you company

Without waiting for a response, past any parking spaces, and finding somewhere else to eat with Lauren.

“I know what you're thinking

The timing took me by surprise. “Really?” I challenged

“You're wondering what Aaron sees in Porcina. Or what she sees in him.”

I *had* been wondering that, wholly capable of making conversation, yet almost consciously choosing the wrong things to say. On the rare occasions when he had spoken in complete sentences, they had seemed almost fiendishly insightful... and then, with his next breath, he would mutter something inane, and tug at each of his facial hairs as though reaffirming their existence. I had theorized that he was suffering from Tourette syndrome

Porcina, switching back and forth between bouts of affected, childish sweetness and entitled commentary. There had been a point, halfway through the drive, when she'd seemed on the verge of another tantrum, so invoked by her discovery that I didn't care for her taste in comic books.

“You *have* to like them!” she had screamed, you *have* to!” Judging by Lauren's sympathetic smile, offered discreetly via my rear-view mirror, I wagered that she'd heard variations of this tirade before.

“Well, “they don't seem compatible, but I guess love is blind?”

“They met at Anime Club

“And they've been together *how* long?”

Lauren counted on her fingers. “Almost three years

I would have loved to converse with her further, wishing that the distance between there and the restaurant had been greater. I doubted if I'd get much time alone with Lauren that evening, and I was trying to make the most of the few moments that we had.

The two of us walked at a fairly slow pace

“It's *cooooooold*!” complained Porcina.

“I told you to bring a coat

“They said we had to *waaaaait* until *you guys* got here.”

“Well, perhaps with excessive curtness. I opened the door for Lauren, only to have Porcina rush ahead.

“They're here!” she declared

How can one adequately describe an utter calamity? What words can capture the feeling of bearing witness to an explosion, repeated in hushed whispers like a legend in the dark.

The restaurant was a buffet.

Stacks of flatbread made their way from silver platters to Porcina's hands. She insisted on sampling every entree, and I watched as more than one patron called a waiter to complain. Lauren and I stole what precious seconds we could to converse, though we were always overseen by Aaron's constantly shifting eyes. (He never left his seat. Not once. Granted, Porcina foisted enough food on him to feed a small army, always with cries of “Try this! It's so *creamy*!”) It was indescribable, and when she was finally sated, Porcina wiped her hands on the velvet drapes.

I was mortified. *I* had wrought this horror upon the innocent establishment, nor in any way make up for the mental scars inflicted.

Our check came promptly.

Then came another... which was placed before Porcina.

“What's *this*?” she demanded

“Bill

“I'm not paying this!” she spat, as was a cleaning charge for the curtains. A dozen acronyms followed, each with a monetary value. Some of them, I suspected, had been invented on the fly... but even if they were fictitious, they were well and truly justified.

“You *are* paying this.” Was that *my* voice?

“No!” Porcina pouted.

“*YES*.” It was definitely me, and you are *leaving* it here. I've seen how much you carry; I know you can afford it. You have made a *travesty* of what *should have been* a pleasant evening, and you are going to *pay for it*.” Who, I wondered, was this man that had taken control of my voice? “You have *thirty seconds*, or I'm going to get *mad*.”

There was silence it the restaurant (though it had started to empty out

Porcina glared at me, I watched as she pulled forth her white envelope and slapped it on the table. The total, I would later learn, amounted to over four hundred dollars. Enough to cover the damage, all of our meals, and a healthy tip besides.

“Come on, along with our bills. “I'm incredibly sorry,” I said to him. Then, I took my own bankroll – a paltry sum of forty, made up of two lone bills – and offered it, as well. “I hope this makes up for some of your trouble.”

He thanked me. I felt terrible.

I drove home, I would hear that Porcina's behavior that night had been the worst that anyone had ever seen, the theory being that she had been trying to get a rise out of me.

It had worked. It had also

We arrived at the townhouse not a moment too soon. I didn't bother bidding anyone goodbye... at least

“I am so

“I'm an asshole.”

Lauren tilted her head to one side. “Well, I mused, it had been a decent impression of *my* father, as well, though only after he had been sufficiently provoked by some legitimate injustice. “Don't worry about the money,” Lauren continued. “She's right: She'll get more as soon as she asks. Her parents mail those envelopes to her at least once a week.”

“That's stupid, knew better than to send cash by post.

“They can afford it.”

“I didn't mean... forget it.” I exhaled, Lauren.” Another breath. I felt my insides shaking. “I've yelled at people. Shouted them down. I've caused bigger scenes than the one that you saw.” Granted, I couldn't think of a specific instance, but it felt like an accurate statement. “I'm the one who should apologize. I could have waited two more weeks to take you out, but I was impatient.” I hung my head a little lower. “I guess I ruined any chances of a second date, huh?”

A moment passed in stillness

“I don't know about that.”

My face shot up so fast

Lauren gave me a smile, “you seem like a decent guy.”

“I...” I stuttered, wasn't it?”

“Not at all

“I can hardly wait.” I squeezed her hand back.

Sorry its been a while since my last Hamgar story, here is another tale from earlier in the semester.

&gt;Be five or six weeks into semester

&gt;Class is about to start

&gt;Maybe he ate himself into a coma

&gt;Door bows outward as incredible gravitational force is applied

&gt;Wouldn'tbesolucky.jpeg

&gt;Hamgar enters followed by his usual stench of day old mayo

&gt;However

&gt;Hamgar's usual spot is taken by a girl who had recently sprained her ankle

&gt;Hamgar stops short

&gt;Waddles over to the girl and tells he to move

&gt;No one in class like Hamgar

&gt;Ex-marine sitting in seat next to her tells her to stay

&gt;Hamgar informs the marine he can't take the stairs cause of his disability

&gt;Marine stares right into the little flint black pits that serve as Hamgar's food finders and says ""Fat ain't a disability mother fucker.""

&gt;Chorus of laughter

&gt;Hamgar turns and inches towards the steps like someone with a fear of heights inches towards the edge of a cliff or tall building

&gt;Shooting one last look back at the ex-marine

&gt;*THUD*

&gt;He makes the first step out of the 5 needed

&gt;I'm not sure the San Andres fault can hold through 4 more vibrations like that

&gt;Hamgar's face is starting to turn red from 1 stair

&gt;Bracing himself even more heavily against the wall he takes the next step

&gt;A smear of mayo is left on the wall behind his hand

&gt;Hamgar takes the next step

&gt;4th step

&gt;He waits there catching his breath and staring at the seat 1 step below like it were a ranch dressing filled ham hawk

&gt;With one last grunt and great shudder of effort

&gt;Dude was seriously about as winded as I am after a 5 mile run

&gt;On top of that the dude is sitting 4 chairs away from me and the smell is horrendous

&gt;I feel sorry for the girl who is sitting 2 seats away from him

&gt;Hamgar

&gt;At least they won't be as loud as chips

&gt;*smack smack smack*

&gt;Fuckmylife.gif

&gt;Hamgar shovels 10 or 12 handfuls of gummies down his bacon-scented gullet then begins getting out his actual school supplies

&gt;His pencil rolls off the desk onto the floor

&gt;Girl sitting near him is far too nice and picks the pencil up for him

&gt;Mistakes

Nothing else happened during class other than the gross over consumption that doesn't surprise me coming from Hamgar anymore.  However

&gt;Exit class room after almost everyone else because I was talking to professor

&gt;When I do get out I see Hamgar talking to the girl he sat next to in class

&gt;Can tell she would rather be anywhere else and wasn't enjoying being hear the wildebeest

&gt;I know her through a mutual friend

&gt;Decide to play the knight in shining armor for once

&gt;Walk up to her and say ""Hey

&gt;She looks really confused for a second then is dawns on her what I'm doing

&gt;Look of gratitude fills her eyes

&gt;""Ohhh well I better go meet her then

&gt;She begins to walk off and Hamgar starts to follow

&gt;Shit

&gt;Step infront of Hamgar and try to make small talk about the latest test

&gt;He just grunts

&gt;Need to think fast

&gt;Remember I have a coupon thing for a free burger from the cafeteria I got from donating blood earlier that day like a boss

&gt;Pull it out of my pocket

&gt;""Hey Hamgar

&gt;He turns

&gt;I look at it like I don't know

&gt;Can see him being torn between his crazy notion that the girl is interested in him and the prospect of free food

&gt;In the end beetus beats out his sex drive and he walks back and snatches the coupon

&gt;""Yes""

&gt;Waddles off towards the cafeteria to indulge his everything-tooth

**Chapter Twelve**
 
Sleep did not come easily that night. The aftershocks of terror and the thrill of rising hope were each like electrical currents running through my body. Jeff had curled up on my couch in anticipation of his drive home in the morning, wide awake.
 
“Sorry about Porcina.”
 
*Lauren* had apologized to *me*! It could only mean she knew that I wasn't to blame! My fears about a ruined reputation seemed almost silly then
 
“She's done this before.”
 
I reread the message for the several thousandth time
 
“Sleeping now.”
 
As I should have been. As I *wanted* to be. Giving in to slumber would see the next day dawning faster – at least from my perspective – which would bring me minutes closer to a final
 
“Talk tomorrow after class.”
 
Well, but in light of her reassuring messages, I was sure that it could only be a good one. Perhaps she would propose an immediate engagement... for dinner, of course... or maybe she'd express desire to spend some time alone.
 
“L.”
 
L for Lauren, L for... well, I shouldn't get ahead of myself. Still, when my eyes finally grew heavy, I was treated to visions of the girl in all of her splendor, clad only in rays of celestial light... or so I hoped I would be. In fact, my dreams were less than pleasant, screaming mass that had me cornered in a prison cell. My legs refused to work
 
It was a relief to hear my alarm going off.
 
Jeff bid me goodbye before leaving for home, making the brief walk from my apartment to the college. Out of caution, I avoided the place where the school's shuttle stopped, knowing that the location was frequented by Porcina. We didn't share, to the best of my knowledge, any common classes, and I was sure I would have remembered if I had seen her before our date... but still, ready to run at the first sign of her presence.

As I had predicted, not even the lurid video that a fellow student had pulled up on his laptop. I waited for the bell to ring, reminded myself that there *were* no bells, and wondered why I had come to class in the first place. It was something to do, I supposed, in the time between getting up and meeting my heavenly angel. Finally, after eons of waiting and ages of impatience

“Done with class

I knew the college campus well. Outside the administration building, comfortable, and only *slightly* romantic. I described the place to Lauren, who promised to see me there soon.

Class be damned! I rose from my seat immediately and made directly for the door, found that the grove was already populated by an impromptu study group. Well, we'd just have to ignore them. I nervously paced the clearing, checking my phone for any further messages... until at last, from in the distance, I saw a petite woman approaching.

I waved.

She waved.

I restrained myself from rushing forward like a lovestruck sap in a bad movie... but it was a struggle.

“Whoo. Hi!” Lauren said. She was clad in a sweatshirt emblazoned with the university's letters

“Hi!” I parroted back. “That looks heavy. Can I carry it for you?”

“It's mostly clothes

I made a mental note to look into such an option for myself. “Well, and we made our way to the stone seat. It was much more comfortable than the ones that were present at the mall, though the change in company likely made more difference than anything.

“So. Yeah.” Lauren spoke

“I'm really sorry that I caused a scene, woke you up, I assume.”

Lauren's sheepish grin could have melted even the coldest of hearts. “Yeah

“I'd prefer, but I'm glad that you're not embarrassed.”

We sat in pensive silence

Lauren answered with a shrug. “I calmed her down

“I don't know

“Sorry!” Lauren said again.

“No,” I hastened to assure her. “I was worried she was going to report me or something.”

“Hah.”

“Anyway

My choice of words seemed ill-advised,” she began. “My friends had gone to a different one. They'd gotten kind of cliquey, to be honest. Porcina  noticed me spending a lot of time reading, and before long, we were hanging out a lot.” It all matched what Porcina had told me, though it painted Lauren in a less submissive light. “My mom was concerned about her weight. About Porcina's weight, I mean. She signed us up for a spin class, so I was over there all the time.”

“How was that?” I asked.

“Pretty good!” she brightly answered. “Her parents are really nice people, even though she's the only girl. She never got the attention she wanted, I guess. Any time her parents had to focus on someone else, they'd placate her with food and manga.”

“That's like Anime

“*Graphic novels*

“Me

“Sort... of...” Lauren answered. “They're not exactly *healthy*

I nodded my understanding. “So

Lauren's eyes went wide. “Yes! Don't worry

“Gee

“No,” she continued, laughing, “I meant you're not the first guy she's... acted like that around. She's been a bit... promiscuous... since sophomore year. She also doesn't handle rejection well. There have been *quite a few* guys in your position, and I always get stuck cleaning up after her.”

Literally as well as figuratively

“Is she going to keep... harassing me?” I asked.

Lauren sucked air between her teeth. “Yeah

I blinked in surprise. “Sorry

Meat loaf was a regular in the hospital due to his CUNDISHION. He was a fairly decent guy who flirted with the nurses and the doctors and most of the nurses flirted back just to make him feel better. Now Meat Loaf was single and had developed a huge crush on my mom. This story takes place right after she got married to my dad

""HEY BUTIFUL""

""Oh hey meatloaf

""same old! you need to get a bit of meat on ya bones

My mom shrugged it off and continued doing her daily task on this elephant of a man and making sure he lived to see another day and fill his mouth again. 

His beady little eyes saw my mom's ring and he couldn't stand the fact that HOW DARE SHE LEAVE THIS MAN AND GO MARRY SOMEONE ELES

""YOU GOT MARRIED?!""

""Oh yeah! it was amazing

""A FAGGOT?""

""Excuse me?""

""YOU DONT NEED NO BOY

""I've been engaged for months

""MAH PROBLEM IS DAT YOU WANTED ALL DIS -touching his stomach- AND THEN GO OFF AND MARRY ANOTHER GUY? HOW DARE YOU WHORE?!""

""Listen up

So my mom started to walk away and this beast of a man grabbed her arm

""what are you doing?! Leave me""

""NOT UNTIL YOU ADMIT YOU WANT ME! DONT LIE!""

""Leave my hand right now or I...""

""YOU WILL WHAT?! YOU BITCH! I DARE YOU!""

My mom yelled out for help and a nurse came in and to get his paw off my mom but her tiny self was no match for meatloaf

""Help!""

""YOU SKINNY BITCH

A couple of interns and a security guard came in and got his hand off. My mom was furious and shaking in shock. Police were called and she pressed charged for assault against MeatLoaf and he was transferred to another hospital and was ordered to stay away from my mom at all times.

TL;DR Beast falls in love with a doctor and refuses to believe that she can marry someone that's less of a man than he is.

He wasn't particularly ok with a guy living there

Actually, I don't normally look at race and stuff, but that is shit only white people can do(She was black)."" I was confused, and she said ""The cops came out and you were just chatting with him like it was no big deal"". We're not dating anymore, but I still run into her occasionally and say ""Hey, I think I'm going to chat with a cop."" She's laughs and goes ""Fuck you, that was weird for me. I just never talked to them like that"". Anyway

So, had a friend who hated the dorms and wanted to move in with us, but she couldn't pay rent. I said ""Right on, just make sure she helps keep the common areas clean and doesn't interfere with my schooling. 

Come move in day, ""God, you're like Sheldon. 'That's my spot, that's my spot'..."" In my head I'm thinking ""Bitch I met you like five seconds ago. Don't judge me"". What came out was ""Look, that's my chair and I bought it for my leg. Move"". 

It was at this point

Over the course of the semester

My main issues were about sleep. I'm a combat veteran, I've got class at nine AM. It's midnight. Shut it down for the night"". I got half-hearted agreements. Later the same night, I'd knock on the door again. Rinse and repeat. 

My one move later that month was that they did the same thing and I finally walked in and said ""Excuse me""

I said ""Dude

Thus began the ritual. We even tried headphones for the speakers they had

Then began the food stealing. I like to cook. I actually took cooking classes on the side to curb my PTSD somewhat. It did help. So every now and then, mains, sides, and dessert. 

For dessert one night, and there she was playing Skyrim and eating the ice cream out of the carton.   

I was pretty pissed. I thought we had established that the rules of the house were ""Ask before you take

Interestingly enough

Towards the end of the semester. Beth knocked on my door. She was wondering if she could get an advance on the rent to buy food. I know this girl, but a good guy(he and I are actually friends now), and I offhandedly asked ""Why, is your boyfriend eating all your food?"". She actually started to cry. It turns out, Tubby was eating Beth's food after her run in with me. She felt it was safer to steal from the push over than the soldier. Beth hadn't had anything to eat in three days because Tubby kept eating everything Beth had. 

I talked to her and I said ""Look, and give me the go ahead to take charge of this situation"". I took her grocery shopping and gave her half the next month's rent in advance.

Then, I just find it amusing. 

I told them that, live it up. Have fun. I'm not even going to get angry about playing games till 3 AM on a school night. Because tomorrow is going to suck so hard for you two"".

The start of the first day, whether they were hiring or not. And if a single scrap of food was missing without asking permission, that was an instant failure. Failure to do anything above, would result in immediate dismissal from the house. They weren't on a lease, and I defied them to prove they lived there. 

Tubby bitched and complained. I said ""Complain all you want. At noon

I came back

Awwww Yeahhhh. I called some buddies up and we meticulously bagged everything up and brought it into the yard. Three 18 packs of Budweiser for a moving service is a bargain in my mind. 

She came back and tried to beg Beth to let her stay and not make her move back into the dorm. I'm so proud of her

Bless me, leaving the planet on the next shuttle to mars. 

In the month or so that I have been gone, I went on Vacation last-minute with the girls to Spain (yes, including PorkPlanet) and went to visit Cuteguy at his parents home for a few days.

I have lots of stories to tell. Some.... my best stories yet

YOU GOIN' LUV DIS STORY FATPEOPLESSTORIES. I DID IT FOR YOU!! I DID IT FOR ALL OF YOU !!!!!

&gt; Arive back to house. 

&gt; Fuckingtired.gif. 

&gt; Did a 20 mile bikeride with Cuteguy that morning

&gt; Needed to come back to the house to work a few shifts this week.

&gt; Nobody is there except for Porkplanet and Otherhousemate#2 but she's been working a tonne. Everyone else gone for the summer. 

&gt; Open front door. 

&gt; House a visible dump. Shoes and bags everywhere in hallway. Stale smells of bacon and grease. Not kidding. 

&gt; Hot and windows not been opened in what feels like a month. 

&gt; whatthefuckinghellwhyisntthishousetidyforoncetiredrage.rar

&gt; Hear rumbling from the living room. 

&gt; Oh god I just want to come home to a quiet house. 

&gt; Open living room. 

&gt; Hit by smell. 

&gt; Hit by sights

&gt; Hit by horror. 

&gt; Porkplanet: HUYYYYY GURL HUYYYYYYY

&gt; Tundra of beasts: HUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

&gt; Me *visibly grumpy*: Hi can we open a window in here please. 

&gt; Porkplanet: YOU BE GRUMPY!

&gt; Me: I cleaned this house not even 2 weeks ago and nobody has hardly been here and now the house is a mess and smells stale. 

&gt; Porkplanet: teehee sorry I will clean up tomorrow. 

&gt; ignoring the guests for the moment and opening up the double doors in the living room to our back garden. ah fresh air. 

&gt; look around. porkplanet, with pizzas on laps. 

&gt; We will call the first one (the head beast, the third, WhisperingBeast. 

It's 2.30pm and they have ordered huge pizzas each and watching TLC.  

&gt; Me: Hello
 
&gt; All the beasts in unison once more: HUYYYY. 

&gt; Porkplanet: These are our new neighbours. 

&gt; Me: Oh really? *internal groan* 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Yeah mate

&gt; PorkPlanet: Myself and RedHeadPlanet went to school together back in Birmingham. Isn't it a small world? 

&gt; Me: Oh cool.

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles*

&gt; Me: U wot m8. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *more mumbles and whispering* 

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Do you want some pizza she's asking? 

&gt; freaked out by whisperingbeast

&gt; Me: Ehhh

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: NEVA!!! NEVA TOO EARLY FOR PIZZA!!!

&gt; Porkplanet: Hur Hur!!!!

&gt; Me: Really. I'm good. 

&gt; I collapse on sofa next to porkplanet. I am so tired. 

&gt; Porkplanet: What did you do today? 

&gt; I went on a bike ride this morning with Cuteguy and just drove here after. 

&gt; Porkplanet: *scoffs and leans into RedHeadPlanet* She is losing weight and trying to get fit and over excercising. 

&gt; Me: I am not over doing it at all PorkPlanet. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Do you mind me asking how much you've lost? 

&gt; Me: Not at all! Over 6 stone! (90lb) 

Side Note: Good news reddit

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: WOW!!!

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Wooooow. 

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *Mumbles* 

&gt; [MFW at WhisperingBeast](http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h306/Yajimari21/tyra_unsure.gif). 

&gt; Porkplanet: *visibly annoyed* Hmmm

&gt; [MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llcuj3vt5n1qagjn7o1_500.gif) 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: *mumbles* That's so unhealthy. 

&gt; Me: Sorry what. What's healthy? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: No. I said that is so UNHEALTHY. 

Room goes silent and tense so quickly. 

&gt; Me: What

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Yeah. You shouldn't lose that much weight so fast. 

&gt; Me: I have lost it in about 9 months. It's a steady weight loss if you do the math. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Whatever

&gt; Me: *getting visibly angry* No. I was just sick of sitting on my fat ass day in

&gt; [Everyones face when.](http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/shocked_fans_omg.gif) 

Otherhousemate#2 walks in. My saviour. As I was about to slay these beasts and make it look like some horrific mass pizza choking accident. 

&gt; RedHeatPlanet: Oh my god excuse me? 

&gt; Porkplanet: All right let's just calm down. 

&gt; Otherhousemate#2: Err

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles*

&gt; OtherHousemate#2: You wot m8?

&gt; RedHeatPlanet: We were just discussing how losing 6 stone (90lb) in less than a year is incredibly unhealthy. 

&gt; Me: I should listen to the girl eating a large

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Porkplanet

&gt; Me: I'M THE BITCH!!! Funny. 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: I'm sorry I just stated my opinion. You came in

&gt; OtherHousemate#2: Wow

&gt; ClothesTooTightBeast: Right

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles* 

&gt; Porkplanet: Oh my god you guys what the hell has just happened? 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: I'm not going anywhere. 

&gt; Me: Yes you are. 

&gt; Porkplanet: What? 

&gt; Me: Get the fuck out of my house RedHeadPlanet.  

&gt; Porkplanet: Omg you can't just throw her out!! 

&gt; OtherHouseMate#2: Yes she can. It's her house. Her name on the contract. 

&gt; Porkplanet: OUR house. 

&gt; Me: You didn't pay the fucking rent this month Porkplanet

&gt; Porkplanet: *stunned into silence* 

&gt; RedHeadPlanet: Fucking BITCH!

&gt; As she's getting up

&gt; Me: Yeah don't forget your fucking pizza

&gt; WhisperingBeast: *mumbles* 

&gt; Door slamming. Stench slowly wafting behind them. 

&gt; Porkplanet storms out quietly. 

&gt; She hasn't spoken to me in 2 days. 

&gt; Been the best 2 days ever. Peaceful. 

&gt; Not taking no more shit about my weight loss by horrible fat bastards. 

&gt; FIN. 

Hope you guys enjoyed.

1372542835.0,1hbya7,Tales of hamplanetry and fatlogic through the eyes of a cardiologist (IV),iidank,552,119,32,"Story 4: HAES 

This was by far my most favourite story since it battled so much fat logic

Mom: 5'6/167cm 120lbs/54kg/8.5stone
vs
Hammroid: 5'6/167cm 265lbs/120kg/19stone

Hammroid was admitted to the hospital after collapsing at the park as a result of dehydration

Enter my mom

""How are you holding up Hammroid""

""Not so good

""actually it was because you were dehydrated

""I KNOW MY BODY BETTER

My mom shows her the chart with her sugar levels on it and tells her that its fine. she just shrugs it off and pouts. 

""Hammroid

""I DONT LIKE IT

whatthefuck?

""Then no wonder this happened to you

""FUCK YOU

""Clearly not

""HEALTHY AT EVERY SIZE

""Yeah

""You're just jealous that it makes me healthy and you're not""

""First of all, if its healthy at every size then I should be healthy too now, right?""

""SKINNY BITCH""

""I've had enough

""YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT

""I'm pointing out the obvious

""FUCK YOU

The Chief if Medicine heard the commotion and came by and scolded my mom for talking to a patient like that but understood that she was just a fat tard 

Chief: I'm sorry about her attitude but she is right

Hammroid: "" FUCK YOU ALL

Chief: ""there's no such thing as being big boned!! you're more than welcome to leave right now""

Hammroid: ""IMMA SUE YOUR FUCKING ASS AND SHUT DOWN THIS HOSPITAL

She signed a few papers so waive the hospital from any liability and went out

TL;DR Fatzilla refused to believe she is unhealthy and argues with the chief of medicine and a cardiologist about what healthy should be

Be me. 5'7, but also dig some unhealthy food and beer.
Easier to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart than the commissary. I hate the fucking commissary.

Almost finished with shopping

Realize in this area of Wal-Mart

Walk towards  freezer door. Notice incredibly obese ham-planet thudding directly towards same door.  She is 5'4, covered in sheen of oily sweat (in frozen food section...). She's wearing this 'dress' top that resembles a yellow flowery shower curtain and jean shorts.

Can't help noticing her shorts have ridden way up. See huge disgusting rash on inside of thighs(chub rub) and the worst cottage cheese legs I've ever seen. Arms folding over on themselves and had the texture of a golf ball..rolls

Sees me looking at her. Does not notice face turn green and small dry heave I do. Smiles flirtatious way at me.
Ohgod.jpg

Open freezer door for her. Chivalry is not dead.  'THANKS
Helpmeanyone.avi

You know those bags pizza rolls come in that each have something like 72 pizza rolls in each of them? She grabbed 8 of them. Every last one they had, horrible food. Most full cart I've ever seen.

Notice her stench. It is a combination of unwashed vagina/ass

Look in her cart, cookies, oat meal cream pies, soda...I can't go on.  So much more stuff, none healthy.

Appalled

Carry on short conversation (I try not to be a dick

'WELL WE CAN GET SUM EXTRA FOODS AND BOOZE AND YOU CAN COME TO MY APARTMENT

Whole time has this attempted 'seductive' look on face.  Notice teeth...yellow as a banana. Jowls jiggling with every syllable

Officially begin to view her as non human. Still try to be gentle. 'Ah

'WHYYYY SOLDAT?!'....touches my arm. I begin to stammer: 'I just...sorry you aren't really my type.'

Look darkens, as she clenched her jaw. Face turns bright red, starts wheezing. By the time she was finished basically yelling, sweat was all over her and even more prominent than before.

'WHAT

'YOU'RE PROBABLY A FAG ANYWAYS YOU LOOK LIKE ONE' as she wheezes and waddles away from me. 'CAN'T HANDLE A NATURAL WOMAN'.

&gt; Normally training shifts are pretty short

&gt; Don't give a shit

&gt; Plenty of overweight servers

&gt; HT is a bit slow figuring out the computers to put in orders

&gt; Halfway through shift

&gt; Still don't care

&gt; Continues to complain about how hungry she is all shift.

&gt; Knows that me and serverbro would never do anything like that

&gt; HT is fired, and left.

&gt; No tip.

I seriously just couldn't understand why somebody else would do that for days. She could have just stolen the quesadilla entirely, or anything else.

Statistically

One is particularly piggy-faced and thoroughly unpleasant to any men she comes across, formerly women's-exclusive liberal arts college, this stuff is not unusual. However, what *is* unusual is that the things I buy for myself (in attempting to learn to cook) go missing, but only after I've cooked them. Not sure who to suspect, except that the kitchen is next door to the hambeast's dorm, and the time span of it going missing is stunningly short. Barring the concept of many thieves approaching from whatever direction in the hallway I'm not in, plus about two hundred pounds, found [**EDIT: Censored out her eyes/identifiable bits. A pic of her

I decide it's time this food thief- I suspected her, knowing that they're going to get one meal out of it.

I dump it all over the beef/fried vegetable mix I'm making. It is dry by the time I'm done that I have to soak the beef in so much oil that George Bush probably wanted to invade. It's definitely ready. I move on to making dessert. I spike the (really shitty) brownies with laxatives acquired from the local Food Lion pharmacy. (First time making brownies. Did not sample.) Both were done- I put them out on the table.

I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to my friend (who leaves). I go across the hall to the bathroom. The floor starts shaking- the lights begin flickering. I walk back out the door in less than ten seconds- and I spy her, thus why nobody ever caught her. Likely requested it. I tell her to put my plate down, and that it's mine. Her piggy eyes go wide, and she says (with a sneer, accented by her fat rolls to a super-sneer) that she was just clearing the table. She goes to throw my food in the trash, and I just say ""fine, whatever.""

I turn around, and is flapping her flabby hands around her chins desperately trying to fan herself, causing all of her fat rolls to jiggle. I watch. She doesn't want to spit it out, but it's burning her mouth up.

She spits it out, knocking the chair back, opening the fridge, and guzzling my milk. The leftover milk I'd spiked with the laxative to make the brownies. ""That's my milk!"" I say quietly- not sure if she heard me or not, but she downed it either way.

[**MFW**](http://handcannononline.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/man-vs-wild/shocked01.jpg) 

I didn't expect her to drink it straight. That's why I made the brownies! Fucking hell

The shitshow isn't over. ""You are terrible at cooking!"" she *yells* at me. **Yelling. At. Me. For. The. Food. She. Stole. Not. Being. To. Her. Tastes.**

What. I'm still stuck with a stunned look on my face. She is calming down somewhat, just more of a puff with a mysterious rattling sound.

She sits back down, making a ""BLECH"" face, takes a swig out of the milk. Tries again. This time downs it and then swallows, using the ""milk"" as a chaser. At this point, I'm just petrified, rooted to the spot. ""Boy!"" she snaps at my staring at the feeding session. I just turn on my heels, an about-face, unable to comprehend what I just saw.

**THE AFTERMATH**

The women's bathroom was closed the next day. Then the shared-gender one next to it. Then the men's became shared-gender so that the women in our residence hall could have somewhere to go to the bathroom. Then that one closed within the day. (My plan began to backfire, bathroom-closing shits.

I realized about a day or two after all this had finished that I'd left the brownies out- the laxatives should have passed through her digestive system within a single day. I am still not 100% sure what happened to them, couldn't resist the free brownies and milk, thus the many, many bathroom closings.

No idea what became of her- I left the college after long. But I still have many more FPS's from there.",self,t5_2vzax,1365668687.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1c34yu/hambeast_gets_whats_coming_to_them/

You know the drill

&gt;be walking to next fair ride for the kiddos

&gt;she is with a few mini moon friends and her fiance

&gt;kirby is still rocking that ""my little pony-esque"" hairdo but with faded colors and blonde with her roots showing.

&gt;she is in line at one of the food stands that has deep fried everything

&gt;we stop at a ride that is adjacent to the food stand because the kiddos want to ride the super spinny gravity ride before they eat any food

&gt;at this point we are about 20-30 feet from her and her pack of friends

&gt;she still hasnt noticed us

&gt;this conversation will be important later

&gt;letthehungergamesbegin.jpg

&gt;over hear her already being bitchy to one of her actually in shape friends

&gt;her friend is about 5'8"" maybe 155, we will call her ""Blue"" because of her hair color

&gt;""BLUUUE

&gt;""it's just, since you guys want to go on the spinny ones""

&gt;im trying to picture how exactly she is going to fit in some of the rides they have been describing

&gt;""fine, and you guys have to buy my food since its my party""

&gt;hear a low, each

&gt;gamer fiance tries to be reasonable and tell her they have plenty of money to buy food

&gt;""NO, END OF STORY""

&gt;BIG awkward pause

&gt;""HEY YOU, YEAH, OK, I WANT AN ORDER OF NACHOS WITH THE CHILLI ON THEM, 2 CORNDOGS, A FUNNEL CAKE, THE CHICKEN ON A STICK, AND A SNOWCONE

&gt;""AND DONT YOU DARE MESS IT UP

&gt;i feel sick just thinking about that much food between 2 people...it is for her and the fiance

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;""THATS ALL FOR ME

&gt;i sneak a peek over and gamer fiance looks embarrassed AF

&gt;""I'll just have a corndog, and the burger and fries""

&gt;just...

&gt;he will ""just have"" have all of that

&gt;he goes to open his wallet to pay (i didnt catch the total

&gt;""NO I SAID THEY HAVE TO PAY, NOW EVERYONE GIVE THE LADY HER MONEY UNLESS YOURE ORDERING, IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING LEFT AFTER I GET DONE, TEEHEE""

&gt; all of the ""friends"" look super pissed

&gt;""I SAID NOW

&gt; guy friend says ""that amount of food is ridiculous

&gt;""FINE

&gt;the guy went to make a rebuttal

We walk around for hours without seeing Kirby much. See them at a few games and such

&gt;we walk towards the car exhibit and hear yelling coming from the pirate ship ride that goes back and forth

&gt;""GET THE DAMN BAR DOWN YOU IDIOT!""

&gt;kirby is yelling at the attendant because the bar wont click because of her gut

&gt;""PUSH HARDER DUMMY

&gt;Kirby finally pushes up on the bar and it sticks

&gt;""OKAAAY YOU CAN GO AWAY NOW

&gt;the attendant looks scared that she might tip the ride over

This is where the funniest/grossest thing I have ever seen goes down

&gt;the ride starts without incident

&gt;kirby has her fit friend squished so tight against the side that even if the bar didnt hold

&gt;the ride starts to go back and forth faster and faster

&gt;oh my goodness no....yes....noooo

&gt;as the ship goes from the front being in the air

&gt;a stream of vomit the size of california perfectly suspends itself in the air as the ship goes back wards

&gt;we are both horrified and laughing uncontrollably

&gt;you had to be there to see the perfect timing of it

&gt;those poor people

&gt;""GIT MEH OFF -WHARRRRRBLE- THIS -GARBLEARBLE- RIIIIIIIDE

&gt;the attendant stops the ride

&gt;attendant gets everyone off

We walked into the exhibit at this point to catch some kind of presentation my hubby wanted to see, so we could all eat.

&gt;we walk out and Kirby is sitting on ground beside the ship

&gt;""GAH, YOU ARE PAYING FOR DRY CLEANING, DO YOU HEAR ME, I COULDDA DIED THROWING UP ALL THEM TIMES, STUCK IN THE RIDE LIKE THAT""

&gt;she has a sheen of yellow on her jeans and shirt

&gt;thats when she sees us for the first time

&gt;all we hear is ""GAH TAKE A PICTURE

&gt;I walk into the tent with my husband

Good thing the kiddos were wrapped up in Pokemon talk and didnt notice any of this

We shopped a little

I kinda wish I had taken her picture since she offered.

Her mom used to run it at fairs and such, so it was costing them money, so they sold it for a nice chunk of change.

&gt;get call to go to remote office to fix a system that ""just won't work""

&gt;not really friendly with this office

&gt;site director was a decent guy though

&gt;walk in

&gt;the secretary greets me

&gt;building is a ""workshop"" for individuals with developmental disabilities

&gt;lots of drool and hugs for those that are into that kind of thing

&gt;ninja my way to the office area

&gt;my worst fears are confirmed when I realize it is an office I have seen before - my body is not prepared

&gt;open the door and the smell goes from noticeable to vomit inducing

&gt;notice that every surface that can hold air freshener, etc is doing so

&gt;trash can is full of fast food detritus

&gt;decor - hardcore ""country girl"" - lots of hearts, etc

&gt;hear a clicking sound like something is trying to move somewhere but it can't

&gt;notice the chair has no arms

&gt;on the wall behind the desk are ""glamour shots"" of the office occupant

&gt;I smirk and wade into the danger zone

&gt;I had never dealt with the chick in this office

&gt;I'm here to fix computers and get money

&gt;I head over to the desk and pull the chair out and notice the computer is covered in dirt and obvious spills

&gt;then I realize it's one that I had installed less than 6 months before

&gt;standard beige ""Wintel"" box

&gt;the poor little guy looks beat the fuck up

&gt;missing the front bay covers, with a CD is still in the tray

&gt;it's the clicking sound for sure - not sure what part though

&gt;go to take a seat when I look at the actual seating surface

&gt;it's covered in various colors of smears - fuck dat noise

&gt;decided that it would be best to just take the tower to the hospital (my work bench at the main office)

&gt;walk out of the office and get some oxygen

&gt;go tell site director what's up

&gt;go back to office and discover a very large woman now is in the chair

&gt;[like this only way fatter](http://www.mybodygallery.com/uploadedPhotos/39000/39289-4.jpg)

&gt;no neck

&gt;without warning it began to yell at me

&gt;""I need my computer fixed so I can get my work done now

&gt;""It's never worked

&gt;""I'm 6 months behind on my paperwork now

&gt;""I can't fix it here"" I replied

&gt;""HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WORK THEN?"" the beast roared

&gt;site director was there at this point

&gt;I then ask her to move so I can get the tower from the jaws of death

&gt;she gets up and then slowly moves out of the way

&gt;her body is already failing - every time she moves I can hear her bones clicking and grinding

&gt;eventually she waddles into the hallway and I get the computer out of her office and take it back to my work bench

&gt;open the side...and find the source of the click

&gt;the bitch had been using her tower as a fucking trash can and it was the CPU fan hitting some hard plastic

&gt;then I found a mouse den (with free mice and mouse turds!)

&gt;fucking roaches run out of case into the work area - my OCD kicks the fuck in and I use a huge hard cover manual to kill them all (for Novell Netware no less)

&gt;the banging sounds draw the attention of my boss; they want to know what the fuck I'm doing

&gt;then my boss sees the computer - asks ""what the hell happened""

&gt;explain

&gt;in walks the head of HR

&gt;""prepare to be fired"" I tell myself

&gt;HR dude is pretty hefty himself

&gt;he asks me ""what happened to this computer?""

&gt;I show him the broken cosmetic parts

&gt;""Can it be repaired?"" he asks - and I reply that it would need a new CD-ROM drive, the case would need to be washed out and cleaned off, and that I have not even checked the whole system.

&gt;I suggest just chucking the system - after they both look it over

&gt;before I toss the system I have to remove the HDD due to HIPPA

&gt;come back in

&gt;I'm not part of the process for deciding what they were going to do with the office beast - but I never had to deal with her alone again.

Short time lurker

My 17 year old, but she's getting a little bit better. We'll call her ""Miss I'll Sit on My Ass Scrolling Tumblr While You Make Me Breakfast Without Offering to Help"" or ""Miss Tumblr"" for short. 

I spent the night and the day with Miss Tumblr

After this she asked to borrow a shirt as she didn't bring one to my house. Whut. They won't fit, triumphantly pulled it out of the rest of my shirts, grinned and me and asked, ""Can I wear this?"" 

Uh, go ahead and keep it.

She miraculously pulled it over her gigantic boobs and squeezed it further. It looked about to rip

Okay. if you think that looks good

Now to the bit I still can't believe happened.

Some background: My seven year old sister is very skinny. She's just a really thin kid

We were out for the day (with my younger sister) and were just heading back home at around 3 pm. We stopped to get some gas and a drink or something to eat at the store there. I got a drink, obviously. As she's chowing down on this treat with barely a pause for breath, I realized my sister didn't eat any lunch and I ask if she's sure she doesn't want anything (she's gotta be hungry, and I feel bad for forgetting about it.)

I heard Miss T pause in her slurping fest to turn around and say

What the fuck.

""Look at your knees honey

She literally said that to a seven year old. I was in shock. She still managed to shove some sugar in her mouth while speaking.

""You're so skinny! You need to eat more. Eating so little is unhealthy and I -"" I managed to shut her the fuck up. My little sister looked about to cry and put her head on her knees and didn't speak for the rest of the ride. 

Don't worry

I know

Once we got home I had to undo the damage that Miss T did to my sister. After awhile she felt 100% better and we made some cookies together. 

Who the fuck insults a seven year old's body? How in that twisted

I'm sure Miss T's fatlogic might strike again

&gt;me then 22yo f


&gt;HDH (hamplanet dating horror) 30yo


&gt;RM (roommate) 27 yo


HDH told me he'd gotten surgery to control his weight, I figured he was just self conscious after losing so much weight. I had sent tons and tons of photos of myself. We always made plans to hang out, go on walks together, etc, but never worked out. We finally met up for a date at my house. The horror begins.

I hear something banging on the railing outside. My apartment was on ground level

I get up, a 2 liter bottle of pepsi, a cigarette and the faceplate to his stereo.


&gt;HDH: YER NEIGHBOURHOOD IS SO DANGERUS I HAD TO BRING ALL MY STUFF WITH ME UP ALL THESE STAIRS.


&gt;HDH is humongous. I am in awe that he was able to leave his home. He weighs about 400lbs (200lbs MORE than he said he was) and is only 5'7 (3 inches shorter than he said he was). 


&gt;Me be sad that he lied


&gt;He comes in my door and discovers that you have to go down a 3' wide hallway to get to the lounge.


&gt;HDH proceeds to crabwalk sideways


&gt;Turns out HDH JUST had his lapband surgery 4 days previously. He'd lied for months. 


&gt;HDH sits on couch, couch 
belongs to roommate.


&gt;HDH demands I give him a cigarette


&gt;Me has never really had a guy over to my place before and I'm from the South so I really want to be nice to guests. I figure we can eat a pizza and then he can go home.


&gt;Me suggest splitting a pizza


&gt;ohmyfuckinggoddontlaugh.jpg


&gt;Me starts asking about why he lied. He puts one hamfist up in the ""bitch please"" position. ""You're fat too. It's not like you can judge. You should be happy anyone is interested in you."" Rage begins to boil inside of me. Ordered a pizza


&gt;Pizza arrives


&gt;HDH removes all the toppings from his pizza into a neat pile on the inner top lid of his pizza box. He begins to lick the top part of his pizza repeatedly


&gt;HDH: ""When you get the lapband surgery your throat can seize up


&gt;His eyes beam at me while he's licking his pizza. I think this is some kind of foreplay for him. I look away, please no one will ever believe me.""


&gt;HDH has finished eating his bread from his medium pizza. I figured it was over


&gt;I smell something awful inside my house


&gt;Me: ""HDH! THAT'S NOT COOL MY ROOMMATE GETS UAs REGULARLY WTF!"" 


&gt;HDH: ""Whatever. I haven't been able to smoke for months because I was prepping for the surgery.""


&gt;He's got a fresh slice in his hand with toppings on it. I look around


&gt;Me: ""HDH! THAT'S SO NOT FUCKING COOL!""


&gt;HDH: ""Whatever. I'll smoke you out


&gt;My rage grows


&gt;RM has arrived. He is pissed that the place smells of skank weed


&gt;HDH: ""You want some?""


&gt;RM shakes head


&gt;HDH starts talking about exwife that left him because he was too fat


&gt;HDH proceeds to talk about how if I played my cards right I could be the new Mrs. HDH; I'd have to do something about my torso though because I was just too fat in the arms and under my boobs.


&gt;RM loses shit. Direct quote: ""She's just fine. You're a fat fucking asshole. If you don't leave right now I'm going to sodomize the shit out of you.""


&gt;HDHs' face twists in horror. ""Whoa


&gt;RM stands up and balls fists. ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR HOUSE NOW.""


&gt;HDH: Snatches pepsi


&gt;RM: ""Never have anyone over here again alone. If he was 200lbs lighter he would be cutting off girls' faces and licking them.""

And I never invited anyone over alone again. Lesson learned. He still tried to talk to me after that though

1372905013.0,1hly10,Chubwub the Hamtub,CV13,511,87,65,"Buckle up my fatties (here’s a seat belt extender just for you) because the court sentence has come down and I’m now allowed to talk about the two craziest weeks of my life. But you’ll have to wait for those stories. First you’ll have to hear the prologue. I’ll go ahead and introduce the villain now and get that out of the way. Meet Chubwub the Hamtub

There's a dash of fat logic at the end

&gt;Be me

&gt;Been single a while but feeling good about myself after dropping the weight.

&gt;Thinking it’s time to get a lady again.

&gt;Some of my friends that are still in college host one of their house party. I decide to attend for the first time since graduating (almost a year).

&gt;Get there

&gt;In walks Chubwub the Hamtub.

Now, she instead does is what I have come to call the Chub Shuffle. She would lean all of her weight onto her left leg (actually causing me to believe her subsequent knee problem complaints) and slide her right foot forward about 18 inches. The foot doesn’t leave the ground, it just slides. She then begins the process of transferring her weight to the now outstretched right foot. Once that monumental task is accomplished, she slides her left foot up even with her right foot and starts the process over. Notice I said EVEN with her right foot. Her left foot never lead in this awkward amble but always followed behind her right foot. It made for quite the spectacle. 

I recognized Chubwub from my college’s dining hall where she seemed to be a permanent fixture in a corner booth. I had never seen her move from that spot which is why I was so transfixed now. 

&gt;Shouldn’t stare. Shouldn’t stare. Shouldn’t stare.

&gt;Can’t help it

&gt;OH GOD EYE CONTACT. 

&gt;I avert my eyes quickly

&gt;Unfortunately

&gt;At this time we’ll have a moment of silence for all the heroic food that fell defending my sanity. Here’s to you serving bowl filled with kraft macaroni. We’ll never forget what you did family sized bags of fritos

No seriously, but that hardly excuses it. At one point she grabbed an entire thing of KFC and I watched one tub devour another. 

&gt;Her hunger now sated

&gt;She waddles towards me

&gt;We then began the least exciting chase scene most people could imagine

&gt;I go up to a group of people I haven’t seen since school

&gt;Chat up a hottie at the wall. Not enough time to get her number before the smell of what I can only imagine was grease deodorant filled my nostrils and I was forced to move on. 

I now respect those old George A. Romero zombie movies. You don’t think those slow moving, and then they’ll get you. I shared a similar fate that night. 

&gt;Get introduced to a group of girls I had never met before. Engaged in friendly conversation.

&gt;Feel rubbing on my back and an awful

&gt;Turn around and realize my worst nightmares. 

&gt;Chubwub the Hamtub has caught me and seems to be grinding all over my back. I can’t tell if it’s just her natural heat or if it’s friction caused from her ample folds of skin gyrating across my body. Regardless

&gt;“LETS DANCE HONAY” she moans

&gt;I look around the room

&gt;“Um

&gt;She cuts me off “NO NEED TO TALK TO THESE SKANKS WHEN YOU COULD BE DANCING WITH ME. I SAW YOU STARING AT ME EARLIER. LUCKY YOU I’M INTERESTED.”

I regret to inform you that she failed to call herself a REAL WOMAN. She chose to save that phrase for a later encounter. 


&gt;She Chub Shuffles her way towards me again

&gt;At a loss for words I put my hands up and continue backing away

&gt;This angers the beast. 

&gt;“WHY THE FUCK AREN’T YOU DANCING WITH ME? IS IT BECAUSE I’M BIG?” She has stopped the Chub Shuffle as well as her grotesque attempts at dancing but her rolls continue to gyrate like crazy. I assume this goes on for hours after she moves. 

&gt;“YOU LIKE THESE SKINNY BITCHES MORE THAN THIS? YOU A SHALLOW FAT SHAMER OR JUST A FAGGOT OR SUMTHIN?”

At this point the entire party is staring at us and I felt my face is growing red. I feared that she would mistake it for a plate of hot wings so I had to think fast to get this situation under control. I did the polite thing

&gt;“No, trying to indicate that the setting just wasn’t right.

&gt;This seems to calm Chubwub.

I fled the scene soon after

&gt;walk out to car

&gt;she struggles to get in

&gt;had found out her exact weight when she bragged about it loudly on her back porch on the phone one night

NOTE FROM ARMY BRO-- dont worry GAB doesnt even come on reddit

&gt;Army Bro point blank tells GAB that OK is flirting with him again

What happens next, and since he is staying with us until deployment, he has seen OK from a lot while outside, and OK has been flirting with him in front of GAB, and GAB has told her to back off more times than we can count.

&gt;manager leaves, I get up to help cause, feel bad for her

&gt;lets her in on the secret that we are proving to our friends how awful she is and to roll with it

&gt;Our food comes, queso and chips, onion rings, steak, a double loaded baked potato, veggies that she barely touched, and 2 slices of cheesecake

&gt;we all try to finish fast so we can get to the bar and get hammered since we have a DD for each car

&gt;Kirby dumps the bugs into her veggies

&gt;at this point we think our friends have taken the hint that she really is a fatty with an AWFUL attitude

&gt;manager comes over and takes her off to the side, she can't stop watching this trainwreck of a person

&gt;some of the table considers calling it a night, so we decide to go on to karaoke with her

&gt;hear manager at this point saying that our waitress saw her put the bugs in the food herself

&gt;Kirby starts screaming that waitress is a ""fucking liar"" and she isn't paying

&gt;manager says if she doesn't pay

&gt;Kirby damands bill and says she will never come back

&gt;manager informs her that that is ok, and planting things in her food to get a free meal.

&gt;Kirby starts crying

&gt;Manager doesn't back down

&gt;waitress arrives with our checks

&gt;Kirby waddles back over, calls the waitress a ""snitching cunt"" and storms out

&gt;we stay behind and console the poor waitress

&gt;Manager says to us after Kirby leaves that he gave everyone but OK a 50% discount because he felt sorry for us

&gt;there are 8 of us, we leave her a $20 tip each, which in the end gives her a $160 cash tip and tell her to not give up, that she was an awesome waitress

Back in 2003, sat down, prepared my books and magazines and awaited my seatmate. 

Enter Americansus Adipemosis. She motions to the middle seat. I remove myself to the aisle and watch as this enormous woman flomps down into the middle seat. A thin

Rules being rules

In retrospect

At takeoff, Hamplanet yanked up the armrests and the full onslaught broke across the de-militarized zone. I was now squished fully against my left armrest. The crushing bulk literally twisted me, nearly lifting me out of my chair. My natural reaction was to stand up and GTFO of there. So I did. 

As I looked down at my chair, willya?"" 

I marched off the the flight staff. Two of them accompanied me to my seat. They took one look

""We agree your seat is gone. But the flight's fully booked, but these are extreme circumstances. The jump seat isn't very comfy, but it's all we can offer you. In return for your patience, you can have all the food and drinks you want; just ask."" 

They were actually very nice about it, seeing as Hamplanet would never fit in a jump seat. Of course, this also meant no in-flight entertainment for me. Just my books. 

I watched Greenland and Iceland slither by from my tiny jump seat window. I ate good hot food and cold drinks and spent a lot of time chatting amiably with the flight staff in the rear of the plane. It was  a very long 9 hours

As we approached London

For the next 25 minutes, I'd have cried. But I was in England now, the land of the Stiff Upper Lip. 

As soon as the pilot cut the engines, fuck the bus. I wanted a beeline to my hotel, along with a triple dose of ibuprofin. And that's what I did. 

In retrospect, or I take a later flight. For me, it would have cost me a day of vacation - a day I would have GLADLY surrendered if I could have enjoyed a civilized flight with, like, a seat. 

Never again. The next time I'm sat next to a Hamplanet, whatever. If they cannot provide me with a seat, I will insist on being removed and booked on a later flight. It's me or the Hamplanet, airlines. Pick one.

Not long after this joke
He vomits all over the table and himself.  Its spills onto the floor and it is just fucking disgusting.   It was like this stream of at least 5 fucking liters of chunky chewed meat.   I felt faint

The wait staff notice, clean the vomit, and keep feeding him. This guy kept going.   I have since been reluctant to go back to a Brazilian steak house.

**Chapter Seventeen**

Like an artist obsessed with detail but cursed with an uncooperative canvas, I decided that they looked fine.) A second shower became a necessity after a mishap with some hair spray, and then a frantic third after an accident involving cologne. There was ample time to spare before the party was due to begin, but I had hoped to leave myself an hour for a visit to the store. A tray of vegetables, I had decided, would serve as both a peace offering to Porcina and an alternative to all of the heavier foods that would no doubt be available... and if she didn't like the produce, well, I supposed.

An appropriate choice of clothing posed another problem. My plan was to take Lauren out for dinner, where it overlooked the city. Unfortunately, dress shoes seemed rather ill-suited to traversing earthen terraces, and I cringed slightly at the thought of including more casual options in my outfit. I had requested that Lauren dress warmly and ensure that her feet would be comfortable, but following my own advice for footwear was proving somewhat difficult. In the end, I chose to stow a pair of sneakers in the trunk of my car, along with a blanket and two flashlights

Still another issue arose when I arrived at my local market. The end of finals, resulting in an impatient crowd of shoppers all competing for choice items. Fortunately, and to my immense relief, a vegetable tray of the variety that I had envisioned was still available and waiting for me. Had I been a believer in such things, I would have taken it as a sign, a cosmic indication that the evening would be devoid of problems.

I should have known better

The first sign of trouble manifested as I arrived once more at the townhouse. I had opted to appear fashionably late, I speculated, the bulk of the gathering was taking place in the area behind the building, which served as a communal back yard for much of the nearby community. I approached the door – noting the handwritten sign upon it which read “COME ON IN XOXO” – and walked into the living room.

It was all but deserted. The only person in sight was Aaron, “am I early?” Once again, no answer. A table had been set up nearby, ostensibly for bearing snacks, but other than a half-empty bowl of popcorn, no nourishment was in evidence. I deposited my vegetable tray alongside it nonetheless, feeling thoroughly bewildered and more than a little uneasy. “Hello?” I called. “Lauren?” Then, “Porcina?”

“In here, but the voice had been possessing of neither an allegedly playful whine nor a particularly grating edge. Still, I approached cautiously, ready to retreat if it should become necessary.

Porcina sat atop her bed, but with a look of tired sympathy on her face. “Hey,” I ventured. “What's going on? Where is everybody?”

“*NOOOOOOOO*!” I jumped at Porcina's wailing cry, no! *NOOOOOOO*!” I could hear her sobbing in between each scream, and my alarm gave way to concern. This was more than just a tantrum. Something was actually *wrong*.

“Shh

“It's *not*!” Porcina argued. “It's *not*

“Aaron seems okay with it!” said Lauren. “He loves the game you got for him!”

“It's *not* okay!” Porcina insisted. “It's all a bunch of *shit*!”

I hesitantly took another step forward. “What happened?”

Lauren's expression went through notes of frustration, and doubt. “Only a few people showed up,” she explained. “They left pretty quickly.”

“Well,” I suggested. Porcina replied with another round of sobs. I stood for what felt like several minutes, watching as Lauren tried to calm her roommate. For all the girl had put me through, I felt sorry for Porcina. “I'm sure more folks will turn up soon,” I said after awhile. “Why don't we go see how Aaron's doing in the meantime?” And maybe get him to talk, I silently added.

By virtue of some small miracle, “you're right. Come give me a hug!”

I did. It was unpleasant... but I had experienced worse.

The three of us returned to the living room, I could suggest that maybe Porcina would want to spend her last night with Aaron unsupervised. One way or another, though, I was not about to have the evening ruined.

“Hi

“My suggestion

“Oh! What did you *briiiiing*?” Porcina then asked of me.

I pointed to the table. “A vegetable tray. I don't really care for snow peas

In an instant, fuck you, *FUCK YOOOOOOU*!”

“What the *hell* is wrong now?” I demanded. “I didn't *have* to bring anything!”

“It was *you*!” Porcina screached. “*You* did it!”

“Porcina

I threw out my hands

“*YOU TOLD THEM I HAVE HERPES*!”

I don't know what hit me harder: The implied detail about Porcina's health

“*What*?” I sputtered. I remembered, wondering even then if a thin rubber shield would have saved me. I looked at Lauren. She nodded quietly. The meaning was all too clear.

“Not contagious.” All eyes in the room, but continued speaking. “Except during a breakout. Infection is very unlikely given the use of adequate protection.” The culprit of the rumor – assuming it had been the cause for the party guests' departure – seemed all too clear to me. I didn't say anything, reasoning that the situation was bad enough without throwing a lovers' quarrel into the mix.

“Porcina, “that's not what happened. They just left!” She tried to finished brightly, but I could tell that she didn't believe her own words.

“He called me a *fat whore*!” spat Porcina. For a moment, fat whore*, and then he *laughed* and he *left* and he *told everyone else*!” She wiped her face with the back of her hand and leveled a glare at me. “Then *he* brought *this*,” she smacked the tray of vegetables, prompting an aerial dance of carrots and celery, “to *rub it in*! They all *left* because I'm *fat*!” Her energy seemed to suddenly dwindle, and her tantrum became more like the sorrows of a mourner. “Because I'm *fat*

“It's not –” Lauren tried to say

Worse still

The men looked at each other. Then

“*SEE*?!” Porcina. “It's because I'm *fat*!”

“It's not –” Lauren tried again.

“*FAT*!” interrupted Porcina.

“It's not –”

“*FAT*!”

“Porci-”

“*FAT*!”

“*It's because you're a selfish bitch*!” Lauren screamed, but now you're just, just... *evil*!” Her tears were flowing freely then, and I moved to comfort her. My heart broke as she pushed me away. “You *lie*, you *break things*, you whine *all the fucking time*, and you try to sleep with *everyone* who even *smiles* at you!”

“Blowjobs

“*SHUT UP*!” Lauren yelled. She took a tortured breath. “You were my friend

That was an unexpected piece of news.

“But now... now...” Lauren sniffed and covered her mouth with her hand. “I don't know what's happening to you. It's *not* because you're fat

“How would you know?” Porcina muttered. “Skinny little slut.”

Lauren laughed without a hint of happiness in her voice. “Porcina

Flashback to summer 2012. I'm in my mid-twenties

Then, I had to help support my mother and my little sister. We lived in a fairly expensive area at the time and knew we wouldn't be able to afford to live there any longer, so we decided to move in with my mother's sister, three states away. Our only income was me, who was able to transfer to company's office in new city.

I was fat before my dad passed. A few months after, inside and out. I was very quiet and polite, but not friendly. Now I realize I was depressed at the time, and all I did was work. The new office was bigger and the co-workers were nice, but I didn't make any friends. It was a lonely time.

One of the guys upstairs took a liking to me though and began assigning me more duties, and Big Bug, who was office manager and Lil Bug's big brother. Lil Bug was about 6', thin, and seemed more attractive than he was because he was funny and flirty. Big Bug was shorter, stockier, and funnier

For some reason, and cracking jokes until I couldn't stop smiling. He was pretty much the highlight of my day It was probably because of him that I became more outgoing, and friendlier to other people in the office.

Enter Hammela. Hammela is barely out of college, and makes friends fast. She was very nice to me, and not so nice to the skinner girls in the office. Probably the first clue I should've picked up on. Any time a fit girl wore a skirt to work, Hammela would be livid, even though whatever she wore . ""DAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE OFFICE ATTIRE!"" she would snarl, little bits of sugar flying out of her mouth, even though whatever she was wearing was usually always equally inappropriate. Hammela had a thing for low-cut tops and short skirts.

Hammela was constantly snacking, a granola bar or Doritos, you'd become Hammela's new best friend. And as Hammela's new best friend, you were obligated to give her half of whatever snack you had. I had to give Hammela one thing though, she tried to return the favor- always at the worst possible time. Namely, when you were on a diet or mentioned anything about going on a diet. Any time me or one of the ""more to love"" girls mused about getting healthy, there was Hammela with a box of donuts practically shoving it in your face. She tried, to ruin any diet we tried to start. No

Hammela zeroed in on Lil Bug as soon as she stepped into the office, I heard everything about their developing relationship and everything else in Hammela's personal life.  Their relationship became something of an office joke. Hammela would always leave her cubicle to be near Lil Bug, flirted heavily with him whenever she saw him, if anyone else said his name her head would turn to whoever said it. 

One day
Me
Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Big Bug just told me I'm being promoted!"" *chewing noise*
Me
Hammela: ""Are you going to finish those cookies?""

Big Bug

Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Hey employeeofdamonth. I've come to say goodbye."" *chewing noise*
Me
Hammela: *chewing noise* ""Lil Bug and I are together
Me

A few days after she quit, and her new husband took on the financial burden. I moved out and decided to apply to grad school. I made friends in my classes. Life was going well.

Then, and that made me more gregarious than usual. I was singing karaoke and dancing, everyone was having fun.

Me: *singing horribly* “My heart will go on and on...”
The feeling of the ground moving beneath me made me pause. Earthquake! All around me
Hammela: *chewing noise* “Hey guise!” *chewing noise*
Holy shit. Whatever weight I lost in the last six months, 300 pound tub of lard. She reeked and sweated grease. She was holding on to Lil Bug's hand, and he looked miserable. Worse, Hammela still dressed as “sexily” as she did before- I've never seen legs that fat on a skirt that tight before. I think I went blind for a minute.

While Hammela greeted everyone, was eating him out of his home, and trying to pressure him into proposing. Big Bug and I were laughing about it, and that probably caught Hammela's attention. She descended on us, the force field that currently held Lil Bug afloat threatening to also pull Big Bug and I into her personal orbit.

Hammela: *chewing noise* “What's so funny? Who's this?” *chewing noise*
Me
She realized who I was, dragging Lil Bug with her. I was unconcerned. 

The rest of the night, where Hammela was sitting with Lil Bug and eating plate after plate of brownies, pasta, and whatever else my co-workers and I brought. It was annoying everyone, as she and Lil Bug hadn't brought anything and she would glare at anyone who approached the table. (Big Bug said Lil Bug was going to bake cupcakes, but someone had gotten to them that morning.)

Lil Bug was asking Hammela to dance, flatter her a bit, and ask her to take a walk with him in the hallway so she could give him some advice (Big Bug was separating from his wife, but had a sense of humor about it). It worked, Hammela was happy to give life lessons to someone, Lil Bug was free!

If only. Lil Bug and I were just about to start a duet

Hammela: *chewing noise* “YOU GODDAM HO! STEP AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND!” *chewing noise*

She walked up to me

Hammela: *chewing noise* “FUCKING WHORE I SAID GET OFF!” *chewing noise*

Still kinda beta and too shocked to say anything, and quote, “SHE TURNED INTO ANOTHER ANOREXIC WHORE”

Lil Bug dumped her then. It was the greatest office Christmas party ever. Story not over.

&gt;Be me, working literal 17 hour days split between 2 jobs. 

&gt;Don’t be ObliviousGamer, 170ish pounds, he was skinny by the luck of having the metabolism of a humming bird. Not really fit, but thin. Slowbro and Jigglebitch were living with him until a few weeks before this story. Also, my current (in this story) BF. 

&gt;Don’t be my brother, and sitting on your ass.)

&gt;Don’t be Jigglebitch


Now, I had just moved back to Tennessee, and he requested to see me. All other people in this story being unemployed, they had to wait for me to get time off. Also, I was avoiding them like the plague. Finally, Slowbro just randomly showed up at my house, when I happened to have time off and no excuse to avoid him. 

&gt;(Hear’s knock on door)

&gt;Well

&gt;Opens front door

&gt;Of course not

&gt; “Oh good

&gt; Hellno.gif

&gt; Looks down at outfit.

&gt; Day off so not dressed

&gt; fuck. 

&gt; Then I remembered my brother’s “type” of gf.. and I just had to meet this shebeast. Morbid curiosity. 

&gt; Car is parked behind bushes. Damnit.

&gt; “Yeah

&gt; “Uh, and you can meet JiggleBitch”

&gt; suspicious.

&gt; I grab a towel, and throw tank top/shorts over it and head out the door. 

&gt; Get into back seat

&gt;Old car

&gt;Face like a bulldog

&gt;Entire 15 minute ride

&gt; Awesome. 

&gt; We get to lake

&gt; Now

&gt; Slowbro and Jigglebitch paused for a smoke. 

&gt; I finally get a good view of jiggle bitch. 

&gt; holyfuckingshit. 

&gt; In Soffee shorts atleast 3 sizes too small

&gt; Cellulite.. cellulite everywhere. 

&gt; Oh well

&gt; Wrong. 

&gt;Jigglebitch begins removing what little clothing she has. 

&gt; Shirt is peeled off

&gt; The string holding those two triangles was nowhere to be found

&gt;Shesgottabedonenowright?!

&gt;Wrong again. Oh so very very wrong. 

&gt; She reaches under her stomach slab to access the severely overworked elastic band of the shorts. 

&gt;Takes her a minute

&gt;Shorts slowly begin making their descent towards the ground. 

&gt;MYEYES.

&gt;Under her hoochie shorts was even more cellulite, though there was no sign of them. 

&gt; “What do you think Slowbro

&gt;Slowbro agrees that he does.

&gt; Jigglebitch “teehee’s” again

&gt; Jigglebitch finally acknowledges my existence

&gt; I make a run for the shore

&gt; *I don’t CARE where you are or what you’re playing get over here right now

&gt; He laughs. He knew what I was in for and didn’t warn me. 

&gt; I look over at jigglebitch dry humping my brother on the hood of the car. (Is it dry humping when you’re sweaty and covered in a thick layer of grease?)

&gt; Promise sexytimes to ObliviousGamer if he rescued me. 

&gt; “Be there in 5 minutes”

&gt; Relieved

&gt;  Slowbro hollers back at me, are you coming or what?”

&gt;I lie. “Yeah

&gt;Slowbro and Jigglebitch go back to talking about how sexy jigglebitch is. 

&gt;I mostly ignore them, “lolololol wtfitsaries can’t pull of a bikini like me. She doesn’t have my currrrves. She’s too skinny.”

&gt;Now, with actual boobs and a decent hip/waist ratio, nothing about me was even “skinny” let alone “too skinny”.

&gt; ObliviousGamer pulls in. 

&gt; Acts like it’s a coincidence he was here

&gt; I get up and give him a hug.

&gt; Jigglebitch rushes out as fast as those flabby treetrunks could carry her. 

&gt; “OG! OG!! What are you doing here?!”

&gt; Slams into him in what can only be described as a squishy “Glomp”

&gt; I do nothing

&gt; Until she grabs his butt. 

&gt; She grabs his butt. In front of me. In front of her bf

&gt; Decide not to react

&gt; “ARE YOU COMING IN THE WATER OG? IT’S SOOOO NIIICE. WE’VE BEEN HAVING SOOOO MUCH FUN JUMPING AROUND! I GOTTA BE CAREFUL THOUGH

&gt; Wat.

&gt; Is it flirting with him? O.o

&gt; She’s only been in the water 5 minutes.. there was no jumping.. or swimming.. just awkward bobbing of fat with the waves. 

&gt; And that top isn’t going anywhere unless someone puts the poor strap out of its misery with a pair of scissors

&gt;Bitch mode: Engaged. 

&gt; OG

&gt;Pulls out McBeetus bag

&gt; I look over at JB. nope. Not hungry. 

&gt; “OH MY GLOB

&gt;Lol

&gt; “Uh

&gt; “BUT YOU JUST OFFERED SOME TO HER! ARE YOU SAYING I DON’T NEED IT ‘CUZ I’M FAT? I’M STARVING!”

&gt; “Uh

&gt; True. Between two jobs I generally put sleep before eating

&gt; “SHE’S your GIRLFRIEND?! NO WONDER YOU’RE TRYING TO FEED HER, WITH CURRRRRVES.  teehee.”

&gt; Wat. 

&gt; Then she goes on and on about how she forgets to eat all the time too. She has no idea how she’s not “anorexic” because she “hardly EVER eats” .

&gt; OG- “Don’t you drink Mountain Beetus ALL day long?”

&gt; “WELL YEAH

&gt; “Do you know how many calories that is by itself??”

&gt;”DON’T BE STUPID OG

&gt; OG grabs burger

&gt; Burger gone

&gt; “ARE YOU TRYING TO HOLD MY HAND OG? teehee NOT INFRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND!”

&gt; “uh

&gt; “OH

At this point

&gt; Slowbro finally realizes JB isn’t in the water

&gt;JB reluctantly heads back to her own bf. Swaying her hips to look “sexy” as she lumbers down the beach. 

&gt;It’s hot

&gt; OG takes off his shirt and jumps off the nearby dock

&gt; OG and Slowbro begin discussing video games. 

&gt; “LIKE MY NEW BIKINI OG? teehee. I GOTTA SHOW OFF THESE CURRRRRVES”

&gt; “uh.”

&gt; “YOUR GF IS TOO SHY. SHE COULD PROBABLY WEAR A BIKINI TOO

&gt;about the same size. 

&gt;She has at least 100lbs on me. 

&gt;20 minutes ago

&gt; “I’m not shy

&gt;  “TEEHEE! I HAVE THAT PROBLEM ALLLLLL THE TIME. MY BOOBS ARE SO BIG.”

&gt; “urm

&gt; JB gets out and decides to jump off the dock. She waits until she’s directly in front of OG

&gt; “teehee

&gt; “could you please quit flashing my boyfriend? We get it

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW! YOU’RE AFRAID I’LL STEAL HIM AWAY FROM YOU.”

&gt; I’m done.

&gt; “no

&gt; “YOU’RE JUST MAD BECAUSE OG LIKES BOOBS AND YOU DON’T HAVE ANY”

&gt; fuck it

&gt; “EW **LOOK** AT THAT **GUT**

&gt; OG

&gt; Jigglebitch stomps away

&gt; Everyone turns to slowbro.

&gt; “She’s not usually like this.. I swear..” he mumbles and goes to comfort her. 

&gt; lol she’s already comforting herself with her stash of kingsized melted candy bars she pulled from somewhere in the car.

My mom hangs with a group of ladies from our church.  They're all pretty awesome, but gave that up when it became clear that no one wanted to study the Bible, they all just wanted to drink and shoot the shit.

&gt;So it came to be that such a gathering was to take place at our house.  

&gt;Mom was stressing out about preparing food

&gt;Well hello, there are nibbles on the coffee table.

&gt;Everyone settles in the living room, drinking, bitchin.

&gt;D disappears to the kitchen.  Wine refills?  Going with wine refills.

A word about hospitality.  We are from the Southern US, you would never go digging in the kitchen for something else.  If you have dietary needs or something, you mention it and the hostess would go out of her way to find you something, but you would never just root around in the pantry or fridge.  Back to story.

&gt;Notice D is missing.  

&gt;Check kitchen to find D standing over the empty artichoke dip dish.

&gt;She had dug it out from an out of the way alcove and gone into our cupboards to get tortilla chips for it.

&gt;""But I guess if you didn't make enough for everyone...""

&gt;Oh.  No.  Bitch done fucked up now.  She has insulted my mother's hospitality.  This cannot be borne.

&gt;Ms. Manners is gone.  I'm about to go full redneck over here.  

&gt;We're talking Antoine Dodson

&gt;Gonna climb in her windows and poison her trees.  She better hide her chips

&gt;Seeing the smoke come out of my ears

&gt;Right.  Right.  You know better Lsjess.  Never go full redneck.  It's cool.  Be calm.  You know her mama obviously didn't raise her right.

&gt;She has brought the dip.  With double the mayonnaise.  She lifts a small spoonful

&gt;Gives it to me

&gt;Not gonna eat that.  The devil is a lie.

&gt;Me and dad set up a stakeout.  Watched throughout the night to see who else ate the dip.

&gt;4 people poked at it dubiously with chips.  Chips came away soaked in oil.

&gt;Saw D scoop up a chip full.  Watched oil drip down her fingers.  

&gt;Couldn't watch this ignoble death of sweet artichoke.  Parmesan has never been so abused.

&gt;Leave for 10 minutes.  Come back to find dip bowl empty.

And that, the rude lady who insulted my mama's hospitality and then ate a jar of hot mayonnaise with a sprinkling of parmesan. 

For those who aren't up to scratch on the finer points of southern culture

Harvey Updyke is a fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team.  Our hated rivals, I hate Auburn myself, but it was a really trashy, shitty, unsportsmanlike thing to do.  So now we've turned it into a joke and ""pulling an Updyke"" means poisoning someone.

So there's the cultural references.

Today I was walking into the break room to heat up my lunch. I smelled a strange combination of smells. Mexican food, about the same size I was a few months ago) with a bag of McDonalds in front of her. I have never seen her before, so I say hi and stick my meal in the microwave. As it heats, I sit down to make polite conversation. I find out that she is new to the company. It's her first week. She asks me about my work and I explain what I do. As I am talking, she starts to unpack her meal. Two large french fries, a huge cheeseburger, 20 piece chicken nuggets, two apple pies. She sets to work. I am trying not to judge.

When my food beeps, trying to make polite conversation. ""I love pickles,"" she replies. ""I am just trying to watch my sodium intake."" ...wat? 

I start eating my lunch (homemade stirfry, I got a whiff of the strongest, mustiest, fishiest smell I have ever experienced. It was like old sharty boxers, soaked in tuna juice, packed in a ziplock bag, and left in a hot car. I cleared my throat.

She sits back down with a can of coke and pours it into her cup. ""They never give you enough coke in these things. It's all ice, some how she has a platter of mexican food in front of her. She doesn't have any other bags. The only thing I saw when I sat down was the McDonald's bag. I didn't hear her get up, and she didn't walk over to the fridge area. I have no idea where this taco platter came from. It's as if she summoned it out of ~~fat~~ thin air.

""What kind of apple is that, ""I never eat apples because they are Genetically Modified and that isn't good for you."" She then begins shoveling tacos and beans into her face. ""I am on a diet right now, so I am trying to eat better. I am actually doing low carb, but I will have an apple every once in a while,"" I tried to explain. Granted... I don't really need to explain myself to her, but I am trying to be polite. ""Low carb diets are terrible for you. You will never lose any weight doing that. (Side note: I am down 30 pounds.)

Part 2:

""I'm Sorry Sir

So my boss was in a meeting this morning and things were slow

If anyone didn't read the first part and want to catch themselves up with a TL;DR version…Part 1 , pancetta wrapped, panko crumb encrusted heart, our fat husband manages to dislodge, along with half a candy apple, his last remaining modicum of human decency and allows the bewildered and extremely understanding (for some reason???) handicap woman to sit beside him, forcing his own wife and the wheelchairbound woman's husband to find seating elsewhere. The scene in ""The Road"" where they stumble upon the cellar full of half-butchered human livestock lying in their own filth demonstrated more humanity.  As /u/brjohnson789 succinctly put it: Dios mio

After this short and unpleasant opening scene

So the bus ended up getting us to the hotel at around 9PM. I had planned on slamming a 40 and passing out on the bus ride there, everyone was a morally bankrupt shell of a human being, and that I had ruined season 4 of Arrested Development for myself because I had put it on too much of a pedestal before it had even come out. I got off the bus and some guy in a golf cart drove off with my bag; then I found the lobby bar, had 3 double gin and tonics, smoked 4 Marlboro Reds and called it a night. 

The next day when I woke up at around 10AM fully clothed on my still made bed, and made my way to the pool for a day of heavy drinking, maybe a couple failed alcohol-encouraged attempts at socializaion, some sleeping and some sunburning. I ordered a bucket of 6 mexican beers, found a lounge chair close to the bar, and cleared my mind of unhappy thoughts and holy sweet fuck, I hand't even taken a sip of my first beer when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye: Fat Fuckin Family! They were being chauffered along the footpath adjacent the pool in one of the hotel's golf carts (A Machine for Pigs if you will). I cringed listening to the scraping of the chassis along the pavement as the poor vehicle's suspension bottomed-out under the what-had-to-have-been combined weight of 1400 lbs sitting in the back. The mighty little cart rolled to a labored stop and the driver waited patiently for his cargo to offload themselves. 

Clad in matching bright red quadruple XL tshirts that all said ""Grabowski Dream Team 2013"", and get this: CARRYING FUCKING PLATES OF FOOD FROM THE BUFFET! Now when your last name is Grabowski, I pretty much expect you to be a fat, obnoxious asshole, and these big, fat polish narwhals were living up to this ridiculous prejudice of mine beautifully. Now directly to my left was the cabana, and directly to my right were 2 free chairs, they were the closest 2 chairs to where the golf cart stopped. I could see FFF scanning the perimeter for the most convenient seating available. Their mouths were opening and closing, trying to piece together their surroundings, plates of food in hand

""Go get me a couple (a fucking couple!) buckets-a-beer"" Mr. FFF barked at his 16 year old son

They all had enormous plates of food they had brought from the buffet area. Cookies, eggs, french fries. I stared at it for a bit, marveling at the literal pounds of food piled onto the plates, but It was 10AM and It was already hot as a witches taint outside so the mess into a stew of fries, icing, and bacon fat and I couldn't look at it anymore. 

The next 20 minutes minutes passed fairly unannoyingly and I drank 4 beers in peace. But this Phat Phuckin' Phamily…They just couldn't help themselves. The mother produces a backpack and proceeds to take out a cordless Ipod dock and ipod and starts blasting what I can only assume was a playlist called ""fat and annoying 2013"". I looked around as appauled pool-goers listened in horror as the relative tranquility of the pool scene beagn to be raped by the sounds of (shitty ""buffet"" double entendre ahead warning!) Jimmy Buffet's ""Margaritaville""

The music was extremely loud and after only 5 minutes, I'd say about 6 beers deep, loudly told the reasonable man on the other side of the pool, in front of that man's 2 young kids and all the kids within ear shot, to ""shut the fuck up and mind his own fucking business"". This was classic tragedy of the commons. One selfish, fat asshole using up the shared resource (enjoyable pool atmostphere) of everybody present. The man on the otherside, clearly dumfounded at this unusual lack of decency and emotional maturity

Triple F continuned to drink and be obnoxious as fuck over the course of the next couple hours. Their shitty music, the plates of food littering the area around them that had started to attract flies... At one point, the 2 kids, the 16 year old in the pool, and the 13 year old beside his parents, started throwing food at each other. The FFF parents sat idly by, the husband passed out drunk


I seethed quietly to myself not ten feet from these elephant seals for another 2 hours when finally, started blaring and the hotel ""animadores"" came out with megaphones to rally everyone for some pool games. The commotion was enough to startle F^3 into action. Mr. FFF woke his ass up, summoned his 2 calves from the water and wifey in tow, they left in what, to them, must have been a hurry. In their haste, but probably on purpose, food and complimentary towels all over the place for some poor Mexican lady to clean up (It is their job after all!) 

I waited around another few minutes, I figured I'd make my way back to the buffet and grab something for lunch, maybe try and catch a couple of anoles on the way there. As I left I thought about all the natural resources that these people would no doubt be wasting over the rest of their annoying lives. All the fresh water and natural gas and school supplies that in another, more just life, might have been used by some destitute, Somalian AIDS orphan who could have gone on to become a doctor and cure Cancer or save some rainforests. 


TL;DR: fat assholes act like fat assholes at resort pool.

&gt;Greeter looks at me, that he was getting it ready for me. 

Enter: Mama- tall, and do yoga. Very fit. 

&gt;I look at mama

&gt;BB still hasn’t let go of the fatmobile. 

&gt;I go full beta

&gt;BB then tells the greeter that she needs it more than I do. 

&gt;Greeter looks back and forth between us in disbelief. 

&gt;Mama then starts her rampage. “SIR I DEMAND YOU GIVE HER THAT SCOOTER. SHE NEEDS IT. SHE’S DELICATE BECAUSE OF HER CONDITION. SHE CAN’T MAKE IT THROUGH THE STORE WITHOUT IT.”

&gt;She then looks at me. 

&gt; “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU NEED A SCOOTER FOR


Now


&gt;totiredtoargue.fuckit

&gt;I decide its not worth it

&gt;Greeter stands up straight and looks mama in the eye, and in pain. Your daughter doesn’t seem to have any disability whatsoever, besides being obnoxiously rude. She about knocked over that woman trying to get this scooter.”

&gt;Mama’s like a honey badger.
 
&gt;Mama don’t give a shit. 

&gt;(Starts ridiculous dialogue about her poor daughters condition

&gt;I decide to nope the fuck out of there. 

&gt;Greeter visibly rolls his eyes at the woman as she goes on and on

&gt;I decide this guy is the coolest old guy ever. 

&gt;As he distracts her

&gt;Greeter just grins and winks at me. Continues to piss mama off. 


I slowly make my way around the produce, in her fatmobile, not even 10 feet from the door, was blubberbrat. She needed that damn scooter SO badly, to go the unconquerable 10 fucking feet from the door to McBeetus. I’m sure her “condition” was acting up, and her sugar was so low, that she just couldn’t make it ALL the way there so she could have her Big Mac meal complete with large coke AND fries

Now, but knew her shit. She was one of my favourite coworkers. Annie was the boss, still really awesome despite that position, and, as I said in the last story, is still my friend to this day. She was more of a thick chick. Not chubby, but she definitely wasn't skinny either. And there was David. We was pretty quiet

So, and anytime we’re not working we’re watching Netflix or sleeping.  I stay with OG most of the time, because I have roommates and he doesn’t. Plus, his TV was like 4 times the size of mine, and his bed was better. lol. I haven’t heard from either Jigglybitch or Slow bro since the lake. OG however gets texts from JB pretty frequently, all flirty, none answered. I told him to forward them all to my brother


&gt; Be me, and the line of cars is wrapped around the building. 

&gt; It’s storming like a mother fucker. 

&gt; Power goes out. Register is down. Can’t cook food.

&gt; Lolfuckthis

&gt; Phone rings

&gt;”Hey

&gt; pause… silence on the other side. 

&gt; “Hello?”

&gt; “I’ve done a stupid thing.”

&gt; Ohshit.

&gt; “What did you do?”

&gt; “Well.. slowbro called me

&gt; “..and?”

&gt; “…I told them they could crash here for the night”

&gt; “You did WHAT?! Are you crazy?”

&gt; “Sorry babe

&gt; Yeah

&gt; “alright

&gt;My windshield wipers sucked and I didn’t want to drive in the storm. Also

&gt;We clean up close the store down, and chicken nuggets into a bag because we’re not supposed to sell them. 

&gt;Oh look registers are down

&gt;OG arrives

&gt;Grateful, because I didn’t ask for them.

&gt; “OG

&gt; “You’ll see.” 

&gt; I inhale quite a few cancer sticks to prepare for whatever I was about to face. 

&gt; I walk in, so he was sleeping most of the day. 

&gt; Slowbro comes out of the bathroom and walks into the living room.

&gt; Me- “What the fuck happened in here?”

&gt; Slowbro “uh sorry

&gt; I look around the room. Wrappers, and then a large open duffle bag that judging by the enormous lacy underthings on the top had to be JB’s.

&gt; “This IS just for one night

&gt; Slowbro assures me it is. 

&gt;Whatever. I go into the kitchen to start unloading my mountain of fast food bags. 

&gt;OG sits at the bar and asks which one is his. (he’s a picky eater) I toss it to him

&gt;Slowbro comes in and asks if he can have a burger. I toss him one.

&gt;I have plenty

&gt;Wait a minute

&gt; “She said she was gonna take a nap

&gt;Yeah

&gt;Wait. I look out

&gt;I look at OG. He shakes his head.

&gt; Me- “Aw hell no. That’s MY bed.”

&gt; I walk in to the bedroom to see giant pasty cottage cheese ass, and lacy gag inducing panties. IN MY BOYFRIENDS BED. 

&gt;Now

&gt; I walk calmly back into the kitchen

&gt; *SPLASH*

&gt; “WHAT THE FUCK” 

&gt;The beast rolls over

&gt;See’s that it’s me.

&gt;”AREN’T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE *WORKING* OR SOMETHING

&gt; “Get the fuck out of OG’s bed, as calmly as possible. 

&gt; “NO

&gt; Actually

&gt; The beast sits up

&gt; “THIS ISN’T YOUR HOUSE

&gt; I notice her breath smells like vodka mixed with the usual rotting blood of her enemies. 

&gt;I look around the room

&gt; “Did you seriously get into my vodka?! OG was only fucking gone 20 minutes.”

&gt; “teehee I THOUGHT IT WAS OG’S

&gt; I’m done.

&gt; “GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS ROOM RIGHT FUCKING NOW AND PUT ON SOME FUCKING PANTS.

&gt; “FINE! YOU DON’T HAVE TO YELL AT ME, like napoleon dynamite.)

&gt; The beast storms out of the room. I appear to be victorious. 

&gt;I shut the door and grab some of OG’s clothes to put on

&gt; OG is much taller than me, and go back to the kitchen.

&gt; I mix myself a screw driver

&gt; Then I realize all 4 of the remaining burgers were gone.

&gt; I check the other bags

&gt; Yep

&gt; I ask Slowbro and OG

&gt;OG gestures towards the living room. 

&gt; Sitting on the couch, was Jigglybitch. 

&gt; “Are you fucking kidding me?”

&gt; JB looks up, to protect her kill.

&gt; “MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS LOW

&gt; OG hears the yelling and walks in.

&gt; “Do you have any idea how many calories you are currently ~~cramming down your massive throat~~ eating?”

&gt; “teehee I NEEDED SOMETHING TO SOAK UP THE ALCOHOL teehee WOULDN’T WANT ME TO GET DRUNK

&gt; I’m not intoxicated enough to deal with this.

&gt;OG suggests we go smoke

&gt;Fine. 

We go outside on the back porch so I can inhale as many cancer sticks as it takes to convince myself not to kill that beast. It took a while, and I am easily cold, so I run in for both a drink refill, and a jacket. 

&gt;As soon as I walked in the back door I hear “OH I SEE

&gt;Yeah

&gt;I go into the kitchen to make an extra strong drink

&gt;Jigglybitch is sitting on the railing

&gt; “OH HI teehee I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT OG

&gt; “Yeah

&gt; “OG I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU *LET* HER SMOKE

&gt;For the record

&gt; “I don’t *let* her do anything

&gt; “OMG YOU ARE SO WHIPPED. WTFITSARIES YOU SHOULD QUIT SMOKING SO YOU CAN BE HEALTHY LIKE ME. ” 

&gt; “smoking keeps me from killing people. Plus

&gt; “EXCUSE ME? ARE YOU SAYING I CAN’T BE HEALTHY BECAUSE I’M A LITTLE BIGGER THAN YOU? AT LEAST I DON’T SMOKE

&gt; I just blow my smoke deliberately in her direction until she storms back into the house to complain to Slowbro that I am being mean to her. 

&gt; OG and I laugh at her stupidity


Fast forward a few hours. Slowbro is crashed out in the chair in the living room


&gt;Jigglybitch heaves herself off of the couch as soon as she notices that I am headed for the bedroom. 

&gt; “*OG*” She says in a sickly sweet voice “DON’T YOU THINK I SHOULD GET THE BED? YOU KNOW I HAVE BACK PROBLEMS. I SHOULDN’T SLEEP ON THE COUCH. BESIDES

&gt; “You want me to make my girlfriend sleep on the couch

&gt; “teehee IT’S JUST FOR ONE NIGHT

&gt; me- “You do realize I am standing right here

&gt; She gets pouty

&gt;I have never felt sorry for a piece of furniture in my entire life

The next morning, and start making coffee, open the fridge and it’s totally empty. Now, neither of us are there very often but I know that there was at least a dozen eggs, some random left overs, a couple of cans of monster that I take to work, a tub of butter, in just her underwear


Her excuse? 


&gt;“teehee IT WAS SO HOT

**Chapter Sixteen**

Time is a very strange companion.

The two weeks preceding my second date with Lauren were both the longest and the shortest - at least up until that point - of my entire life. For some of the span, each passing second would slow to a crawl, then slam into the next one like a collision in a temporal traffic jam. The wait was excruciating, and replaying my kiss with Lauren soon lost its sense of potent satisfaction. I had to see her again.

We kept in touch, as Lauren had put it, to a “do-over,” and were again holding conversation in reserve. At one point, during a period of glacier-like clock progression, I took to writing down a list of prospective questions and stories, though I scrapped it, in favor of organic interaction. I had also sworn myself away from stopping by the bookstore

Two Fridays passed at last, a host of seasonal workers for every mall outlet and kiosk. I had hoped that the added employees would lighten the load at Lauren's own job, but as a senior associate, she was delegated the task of training many of the bookstore's temporary hires. Her weekday schedule was suddenly full, but a spark of serendipity had left her free for a date that Saturday evening. We planned our excursion, both of us delighted by the prospect of an evening alone together.

Then

It arrived in my email's inbox, many of which – like lasagna, for instance – seemed to violate the very rule they were meant to exemplify. The letter's recipients numbered close to fifty, which left me wondering how Porcina had managed to acquire so many email addresses.

My phone rang shortly after

“Have you checked your email?” she asked

“Yeah

Lauren sighed with frustration. “I told her I would help when she asked me last week. She *said* it was going to be tomorrow

“Why, “did she wait until today to send out invitations? That seems like pretty short notice, especially if she expects all of those people to attend.”

“I said the same thing.”

“And that list of food?” I continued. “I mean

There was no immediate response, she was still Lauren's roommate and supposed friend. The two of them had reconciled in the weeks since the disaster at the restaurant, and I had heard that Porcina's last few envelopes had been accompanied by disappointed letters from her parents. (Apparently, Lauren had felt that an appeal to a higher authority had been necessary.)

“Sorry

“Oh

“He wanted to know if there would be any single women at the party.”

I couldn't contain myself. “Okay, I quickly changed the subject. “So, uh, are you free tomorrow, then?”

Lauren paused again,” she replied. “I'm not going to let anything get in the way again. You can put in an appearance when the party gets going. We'll leave together. If Porcina doesn't like it... tough titties.”

“Tough... titties?”

“Tough titties!” repeated Lauren.

I'd never heard the phrase. “What? Like

Lauren laughed out loud. “I mean

“Great!” I said. “I mean

“Oh, too. Expect another invitation soon, I guess. I need to go talk to her.”

“No worries!” I realized that blowing a kiss would be pointless over the phone

True to Lauren's word, however, include a time, place, and dress code for the party, although that latter line was little more than “Sexxxy people clothes!”

I wasn't thrilled, after all, and I had been to more than a few. Each of them, in my experience, followed a similar progression: The first guests to arrive would mill around uncomfortably, staring at nothing in particular and offering small talk to whomever else was in attendance. As the throng increased, someone would have the brilliant idea of putting on some music, the alcohol would flow, they would be welcomed with open arms and iconic red cups. Someone – either as a drunken joke or in response to a noise complaint – would invariably shout “Pigs!” which would prompt the underage attendees to dive for cover (or first-floor windows). The music would be lowered and the laughter would resume, would file from the house and break into smaller clusters

You get used to the routine.

Though I wasn't the most enthusiastic of revelers, hoped), would be far too busy with prospective lovers and relationship manipulation to take notice of me, and any social altercations could be avoided by melting into the assembled masses. If all went according to my stratagem, I could meet with Lauren, chat for awhile, then abscond with her and be long gone before any escape was noted. Lauren's promise to be present would be suitably honored, and Porcina would be distracted by food and celebration. It was perfect. 

As they say

Until I found out she asked the director where I lived the other day so she could 'drop off' something I forgot.

Surprised that a food festival wasn't the hippos idea. Jimmies slightly vibrating.

**Axe will whittle them down one by one!**

&gt;Go off and wait

&gt;Walk up to get my food

**AXE CHARGES!**

&gt;Axe abandons her stroller and nudges me out of the way at the counter

&gt;""This Axe food?""

&gt;Foodgirl says ""No

Note* The food is on a counter about 2 feet above our heads

&gt;Axe extends her bingo-wings and grabs the food on the counter

**Cut and run!**

&gt;""I said this isn't your food"" Says the foodgirl

&gt;""Are you even listening

Foodgirl cannot match the Red Mist General and she rips the food out of her hands.

**A slice of the action!**

&gt;Is she really stealing my food?

&gt;By now the other patrons have surrounded Axe. Axe hasn't put any points into counter helix though.

&gt;She turns around to leave. A big biker dude gets in her face.

&gt;""Are you even listening

&gt;Axe decides to switch strategies.

&gt;""No, you heard it.""

The foodgirl cups her hands together and yells

&gt;This stuns her and I'm able to grab the food from her red meaty fingers.

&gt;Axe makes an audible ""HMUUMPH"" sound then goes back to her stroller to wait.

&gt;I take my food and GTFO.

Hello again, during these three months she became a bit of a fatctavist. Whereas before she was just a misguided, awkward girl who happened to be fat, she has now evolved into what can truly be described as a hamplanet. Fat logic and thin privilege galore. This story centers around Emily, and a lot of the information I heard second-hand from her, so forgive me for any errors.

Emily, I must have been a fucking saint in a past life.) She was pretty serious about it back in high school, but after coming to college had to take a break to focus on school. In the absence of this, she became a bit of a gym rat, working out every day. Sometimes I would accompany her, but it was pretty obvious I couldn’t keep up, even when she went easy on me. Enter Nugget. Emily knows the whole, and bless her empathetic heart, Nugget still kinda hangs out with Chris and Devon. She’s obviously spurning me, asking where she got that cute necklace. (Nugget refuses to tell her because she doesn’t want Emily “stealing her style” ^giggle) Emily says that she’s seen Nugget hanging around by herself and says she’s always welcome to come hang out with her and her friends. Oh dear lord. Did you ever put your foot in your mouth there

“I don’t need your *pity*.” Nugget says with disgust.

“E-excuse me?”

“You think you’re better than me because society tells you so

Emily stammers that she wasn’t trying to imply it did, Emily hates the idea that someone is upset because of her. So when Nugget catches up with her on the way to the gym, she does her best to be friendly. Nugget (gasp) *apologizes* for her outburst and asks Emily where she’s headed. Emily is thrilled and says she’s headed to the gym, but she can skip and grab some coffee with Nugget instead. No, no, Nugget insists she not bother herself. Nugget will just tag along. Emily is a little hesitant (Nugget has probably never done gymnastics in her life, unless mental ones count) but never passes up a chance to make amends and so off they go. Poor, naïve Emily. If only I had a chance to warn her.

I’m on my way to class when my phone rings. It’s Emily. That’s weird, no idea what the hell has happened, so I sprint over there and find her limping out, being half-carried by two fellow gym-goers. What the hell happened? They help me get her to the health center and on the way she tells me what happened.

After arriving at the gym, working through the equipment, Nugget watching, and she usually finishes up with a bit of a run on the treadmill. Nugget moves to sit beside the treadmill but Emily doesn’t say anything about it besides offering to run beside her. Nugget refuses, saying she’d prefer to stay there, and plays with Emily’s watterbottle. This is not one of the crumply plastic ones you buy in a 24-pack at Stop and Shop. She’s got some sort of aluminum, double layered, with no warning whatsoever, I couldn't make this shit up.) before galumphing off in a pitiful imitation of a run. Meanwhile Emily's knee is seriously fucked up and in between getting helped to her feet she manages to tell someone to get her phone and they help her out of the gym. That’s where I showed up. At the health center we find out (iirc) that her knee has been hyperextended (like bent way too far back) and she was going to need to wear a brace for a few weeks and do some physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee to help it recover. Luckily nothing that will permanently affect her (otherwise Nugget would be in the fucking ground) but she’s going to be out of the running for a few weeks. They give her some pain killers and tell her to ice for the swelling and bruising, but she’s screaming through the door that if I so much as touch it she’ll call the police for sexual assault and well… fuck. You know how that shit ends for the male party. But hey

So I'm 15 in this story

Now guys, I will not lie about or add anything. This guy GENUINELY talked like this. 

&gt;""PIPLUP SAN

So like i said this guy loved the army and stuff

I got through it, I see Hamocamo on the floor....in tears. Immidiately feel bad and rush over, but the instructor is already there. 

&gt;Instructor - ""I'm sorry lad but I think it's time to call it a day"" 

&gt;Hamocamo - ""I CAN DO IT

&gt;Instructor - ""Lad it doesn't work like that

&gt;Hamocamo - ""YOU CAN'T SAY THAT TO ME I'M A KID"" 

&gt;Instructor - ""It's just facts mate

&gt;Hamocamo - ""YOU PASSED PIPLUP AND SHE HAS AN EATING DISORDER

fuck you

Fps, and extremely anxious that everyone would bully me because everyone knew now. No one even knew I wasn't at school. All my friends were in spain, my sister was in uni and my dad worked all day, earning back the money my whore ass extremely abusive mother had taken in their split. 

WHICH IS WHYY when Hamocamo apologized in an email (I ignored him calling me Piplup-San, and went over. 

Fps. The house stank of piss. Like, all I could see was the urine stains of the entrance hall, even through the misty musk of BO and pee. 

Walking through what looked like a crack den, ~7 dogs. In a tiny one floor flat. Feces, matted fur, red leaking eyes, itching, fleas. All conditions (that my years of sanctuary volunteering had told me) could be cured by just a small amount of care. 

&gt;""TEEHEE DO YOU LIKE MY PETS PIPLUP YOU CAN'T TOUCH THEM THO"" 

Just thinking about how i'm going to report this to the shelter I'm currently at. I may be beta but not when it concerns this. 

&gt;""BY THE WAY MAMA DOESNT KNOW YOU'RE STAYING FOR DINNER

wat. 

Before I can respond to this madness, no things around me didn't spiral in to orbit, but I did see the most disgusting excuse for a human being I hope I ever will see. 

She was spilling out of her bariatric wheelchair. I can't even guess the weight, one foot was bandaged and the cloth on it looked yellow and sticky. Her fupa and what I could see of her lower regions were stained with brown and creamy white. 

My first reaction wasn't disgust or anger, but imagine the life that this woman was living. 


&gt;""HAMOCAMO WHO DA FUK IS THIS. IM NOT PRESENTABLE YOU LITTLE FUCK"" 

Pity gone. 

Hamocamo blusters something to his mum about my eating disorder and how he fucked up. 

The ladybeast turns on me. 

&gt;""YOU AREN'T EATING? IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE MY SON THEN

&gt;""MAM IM NOT FAT IM GROWING"" 

&gt;""SHUT UP MAN

(sadly my mum also believed that and made my little sister a really fat kid

she turns backto me 

&gt;""ANYWAY MY DISABILITY CAME IN SO YOU'RE FUCKIN LUCKY YOU CAME FOR DINNER. NORMALLY WE STARVE

Say yes, still too teeny to leave momma. 

Feeding time is apparently finished

Want to leave so bad

I can tell that HamoCamo has been nervous for a while

Ohgodno. 

Takes me over to his desk

He smiles at me really weird and says ""oh.... oh im so glad... im so glad you wanted me to keep that......please take a seat""

I sit gingerly on the dirty bed. As he rummages through a drawer

Flicking through the drawings i see an extremely poorly drawn manga attempt. There's a girl

It got worse... it got... graphic.. 

And I made the connection. And I didn't know how to react. He's not stupid and can see by my face i'm totally creeped out. 

&gt;me - ""is.. is this me....""

&gt;him - (panicking) ""well... i knew you wouldnt like me.... in this life... this real life... i thought if you saw what we could be....."" 

&gt;me - ""but it's not... a relationship its just... sex""

awkward silence.

he's staring at me

so uncomfortable. 

&gt;HEAR BEEPING. PLEASE BE MY DAD. 

Loljkdattiming. 

Run downstairs

He sits with me, he laughs until the animal bit, and encourages me to tell the shelter where i;m working the next day. 

That night, you can pick another one but it might get eaten too. ""

YEAH PROBABLY BY YOU YOU FAT PIECE OF SHIT. 

Anger in overdrive. Apparently thin privilege IS BEING FUCKING ABLE TO GET DOWN THE STAIRS WHEN YOUR DOG IS EATING YOUR KITTEN. 

Apparently thin privilege is FEEDING AND COMBING AND LOVING YOUR PETS. 

Go to bed in state of sadness and hate. Hamocamo mails me a gif of a rose. Don;t respond. 

Literally run in to my manager's office 10 minutes before work next day. Tell him everything while crying. He rings RSPCA (they can claim animals) and offers our shelter's help. I can't go


I'm told when I get back to work (like, that fat bitch was charged. I don't remember with what but it's 10 years before she can own another animal. I hoped she'd fucking die before that. 

I saw one of the dogs after that

Apparently the huge bitch had said that taking her animals was discrimination because she was disabled and depressed and they were her ""help pets"" (like when genuinely disabled people have dogs they take around with them for seeing/comfort). 

I ended up transferring schools again due to dad's work. But HamoCamo would still send me love poems he just ""found and thought were funny"" some rose images and gifs

Awesome. As I am handing off my interrupted business to said female officer I notice my watch has stopped. Wtf? Suddenly my large metal belt buckle starts pulling me off to the side. What could possibly be causing such a disturbance? Then I see her. Shorter than I. Five foot tops.

&gt;you are only supposed to gain about 30-40 lbs during your entire pregnancy.

&gt;mfw when i have no face.

At this point the doctor is urging her to eat healthier and telling her the grams of protein and calories you should be eating a day for a healthy pregnancy. I know small hamplanet's intake is *much* higher than that from rough calculations

1375777645.0,1jstnu,A loss of £1000's of pounds of stock because a staff member hadn't eaten in a few minutes. (x-post from talesfromretail),Oakwater,506,96,47,"As I was repeatedly told to x-post this here as you would apparently enjoy it

I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our company.

Many moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain. Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day. 

This sunday was no different, she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single sense.

The day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the 10 - 4 shift. Kay had gone for her break at 12 because she couldn't ""last another minute without some food to keep her going"". This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at 1.

Anyway

After devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop. 

I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker. But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be. 

Oh.. well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or something?

I walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for me.

The displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barren.

Strewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown it's contents across the aisle.

Shit.

I panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened. I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunch.

Kay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work. 

Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock loss.

Amazingly.

Just purely amazingly

TL;DR Lazy coworker desire to stuff face means she leaves the entire shop unmanned for nearly 30 minutes. Thieves have a field day.


For the outcome honestly I'm sorry to say that the repercussions were not all that severe. She managed to blag her way out of it somehow with a written warning.

However for some closure

It starts as a conventional story: Guy meets girl. They're both smart, they're happy, shit gets serious. He gets a job across the state and moves. She goes along. She starts insisting on marriage, so they get married.


**Commence marriage!**


Let's call the girl Hammey and the guy S.

Hammey hated her job

Hammey stays all day at home, she needs IT skills. Guy works in IT, offers to train her. Offer rejected.

S arrives after a long day work, refrigerator is empty, house is dirty. ""What did you do all day?"" ""I watched TV and googled for jobs"".


With all the inactivity


**Let Fat Logic begin...**


""(While eating her second pint of ice cream) I don't understand why I'm gaining so much weight!"".
""I'm not fat
""I don't need to take care of myself anymore, I already have you"" (killHerNow!)


**And the laziness


Like drinking the whole bottle but a sip
""The dog needs to go out
""I'll pick up my dirty underwear from the bathroom later. What do you mean? I don't think they've been there for 3 days already!"".
""I took the dog's water bowl away so he won't drink water


**And as her size exponentially grew


""Why are you wearing perfume to work?? You're cheating on me
""S, aren't you??""


Finally, so they had The Talk where he told her it was over and that he had no money for the divorce at the moment, but that he consider them no longer husband and wife. Hammey cried, promised to change, wanted to talk about their issues, but after all the time he had asked for it without seeing results... it was too late.

She left the apartment they shared (it was on S's name) while he was away on a business trip. She took ALL the food there was in the house, vinagre and oil, etc etc. S considered it a small price for getting rid of her.


Enter me

We live far from each other

One morning we go away, turning everything off. We arrive and the fan in the bedroom is on. Weird, I must have forgotten to turn it off. S checks something in the kitchen and announces ""Hammey was here"". Yep, he was never able to make her return the key (thanks for the warning, love!).

So we looked around

- In the bathroom counter 5 or 6 girl perfumes. Girl supplies and makeup in the drawers (Yeah
- In the tiny laundry room
- Woman shoes in the closet. Think US size 8.

Well


He calls to complain and to


**""You're dating a little girl! Those were too small to be women's! You're a pedophile! I'm going to destroy you in court!""**


As a final comment to round this up, place, date and time. (WTF???) Tried to get a monthly payment from S (why?? no kids (thank you higher powers!), she was totally capable of working and had given up nothing for S). Motion denied, even after she presented some screenshots of gtalk conversations between S and I.


**Hammey is out of our lives. She got bigger.**


Wow


**TL;DR**: Chubby girl uses fat logic and laziness. It's super effective! Your chubby girl has evolved into a Hammey. Hubby gets tired of her shit, finds evidence of normal size clothes and assumes ex-hubby is a pedophile, because ""those are little girl clothes! no women fit in those!"".

I'm a 25/f who weighs approx: 145lbs.  K was around 5'5"", but over time we lost our friendship.  We decided to meet up recently to rekindle our relationship and drink some brews while we are at it. 

Now, birkenstock girl.  lovedemjamz.jpeg.  But the thing about me, I don't buy into hippie logic.  I don't believe in chakras, auoras, souls, herbal alternatives to medicine and what have you.  I just really like jamming out to some Phish.  And I don't smoke pot. 

K was always a stoner, I recognized her right away...except a few things had changed.  She went from 175 high school weight to 260lbs soaking wet.  She had disgusting matted dreads and was wearing yoga pants that were 2 sizes to small for her.  She reaked of pot.  

We sat at a booth and ordered some beers.  I got cheap ass PBR and she got some organic house made expensive as fuck brew.  I bet it taste good.  She also ordered chicken wings, a basket of french fries, and a few sides of ranch.  

""But k
""Teehee

Wonderful. Now I probably have to put up with her rancid fucking farts for the rest of the night.  Lactose intolerant farts are the worrrrrrrrrst.  

We begin talking about our lives for a while.  I tell her that I've been in school, she and I both dealt with our issues.  She was off and on medications, while I tried to stay above water without them.  We talked for a while about this, then she asked if I was taking meds to help.  

I thought the conversation was going to go down the path of two friends who have a mutual issue talking about what works for them and which doctors have helped etc.  But no. It went down this path.

Me: Yes

K: NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.  I would never let those harmful chemicals into my body.  My holistic doctor and I came up with an herbal based regime that REALLY works much better.  My auora has turned from black to yellow!  Can't you see?

Me: Uhh...sure...

K: I can't believe you're taking those medications.  It's so bad for you. (said as she dips another fried pickle into a giant vat of ranch and stuffing it down her gullet)

Me: Well

K: you should see my holistic doctor.  He might be able to help with your weight problem too.

Me: My WHAT problem?  (I was running daily and eating healthy. I worked hard to drop a lot of weight that I had gained throughout my depression.)

K: Your weight! You're so underweight.  You should come with me to Whole Foods tomorrow and we'll get you some stuff so that you get healthier!

So, tries to get me to smoke pot with her in the bathroom, tries to steal my anti depressants out of my purse, and berates the waitress for not having ORGANIC MIXED SHOTS. 

When I left, it sounded just like the episode of It's Always Sunny where Pdiddy plays a holistic doctor out of a garage.  It was sketch.

1372514764.0,1hb6jf,[More sad than funny] My hamplanet sister is eating up my mothers early retirement,CanadianJesus,489,81,103,"Hello /r/fatpeoplestories . Long time reader

I should say that everything in this post is true and revolves around the gravitational pull of my genetically half but size-wise full sister. I don't want to out her with her real name but she shall henceforth be known as BS

Most of her skewed logic isn't truly fatlogic but something I would like to call I-don't-understand-simple-economics-or-how-to-run-a-household-logic or poorlogic for short. I'm still posting it here in /r/fatpeoplestories since if my sister happens to be a redditor

I should start by introducing my family

My parents were born in post-war Sweden in a time were food rationing were still in place to working class parents who themselves had lived through the depression. They were taught to be frugal and how to make every penny count. They preferred to set up savings accounts for me and my sisters and paying off their mortgage instead of buying a new car every 3 years and going on far away vacations every summer. There was a big [credit crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_banking_rescue) in Sweden when I was very young that further confirmed their distrust of borrowing money and lavish lifestyles.

Like I wrote earlier

BS has always been fat, soda was for birthdays and special occasions and candy only on Saturdays. Hell, there wasn't even a proper fast food restaurant in our town until I was eight or nine. 

I suspect my late maternal Grandmother had a great deal of responsibility when it came to fattening BS as a young child

BS grew up from a fat child into a morbidly obese woman. As she left the nest she left what little healthy eating habits she had and started cultivating mass. By the time she got her degree she was weighing in at roughly 90 kg

As BS accumulated mass she also attracted her to-be husband Cokeman (CM),90 m and body size I would estimate his weight to 110 kg. I should say these figures are based on memory and estimates and can be off by a bit. When he wasn't guzzling coke he was snacking, eating takeaway or his home-cooked meals. He did and does like to cook, but he doesn't seem to know that there are other ingredients than heavy cream, cheese, red meat and processed carbohydrates. When they started dating he was living on his own in a ""bachelor pad"" but entirely dependant on his mother. She would pay his bills with his salary and give him whatever there was left as an allowance. She also did his laundry and on several occasions his dishes.

After several years of dating and weight-gain BS got pregnant (I don't want to picture how) and they decided to buy a house. This is the part where BS started to become dependant on my parents for financial aid. They found a house they liked in a small town where houses are cheap and living expenses low (by Swedish measures) but due to a lack of savings they had to get a 100 % mortgage on the house. The bank wouldn't allow this so my parents and CM's parents each put in roughly  $7500 as encumbrance(I believe this is the proper term) on their own houses. BS and CM assured that they were good for the money and that they would pay off the top part of the mortgage in a few years

And so they did. As they moved into the house BS was gaining pregnancy weight as if she was pregnant with octuplets. By the time she was about to give birth she weighed close to 130 kg. This was just pregnancy weight
 
After a birth complicated by her massive weight she gave birth to my niece. At her six-month check-up she was at a normal weight but soon after they started feeding her solid foods she started ballooning up. I don't think she was even a year old before CM started giving her coke. I know babies are supposed to have a bit of fat but a 2 year-old shouldn't have rolls on their arms. [This](http://wac.9ebf.edgecastcdn.net/809EBF/ec-origin.nyc.barstoolsports.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2010/08/fat2-385x640.jpg) is an approximation of what she looked like at age 2. This of course never concerned BS and CM since babies are supposed to be chubby. Never mind that their now six year old daughter weighs the same as two of her preschool classmates. 

BS never lost her much of her pregnancy weight but didn't seem to gain any for a while either. Not until she became pregnant with child number two

BS was often calling my mother making short-term loans because something unexpected had happened, were unable to emancipate themselves financially. They never had to buy much for the house, they didn't go abroad for holidays and they were both working or intermittently on parental leave (80 % of your normal salary).

The answer, they were eating their entire pay checks. I'm talking monstrous amounts of takeaway, pre-made meals , snacks and baked goods. Not to mention CM's several litres a day coke habit. While BS did quit smoking during her first pregnancy, she started as soon as she could afterwards. She repeated this performance for the second child. CM never saw a reason to quit either time, not even to support his wife.

While my parents thought it was bad enough that they couldn't afford to fix a broken fridge unexpectedly, but close to $50000 in credit card and pay-day-loans alone. My parents and CM's parents had to come with them to the bank to renegotiate the mortgage payments so that they were only paying interest. My parents are of course furious about this situation since they have put down their own money into this and they stand to lose it all if they default on their mortgage. 

During the spring they seemed to be doing quite well under the circumstances. They were now on welfare since CM got fired for being to lazy and they had put their house on the market since they can't afford to live there any more. They are also applying for something called debt sanitation in Sweden

Of course money troubles is never good for a marriage so this is the time BS and CM decided they should get divorced. At first they agreed on separation when they could sell the house but after CM finding that BS had been unfaithful he more or less threw her out of the house.  She is now living at a friends house.

BS is now asking my parents to co-sign the lease on a flat for her since she's got a bad credit score. My parents are really tired of caring for this 34 year old teenager but they can't cut her out or their lives without missing out on the grandchildren. My father is recently retired and my mother was going to retire a year early but now she can't since she has to support BS. Never mind that she has been on sick leave several times for work-related stress and has to take sleeping pills every night in order to not lay awake worrying.

TL;DR: My hamplanet sister has put herself in a shitload of debt and expects my parents to clean up after her.

Epilogue: I have several fatpeoplestories to share about BS but since just the back story turned out be a monstrosity on its own they will have to come in a separate post.

While I cannot argue with this poignant analysis of the human condition

“The survival rate for a person suffering from fat logic is derived by a figure of the calories consumed and is on a direct inverse proportion to the number of simultaneous sufferers they are in contact with at any given time.”

Now

Thus, I doubt you would have to strain your eyes).

For those of us who are newcomers to the series or merely would like to once again regale themselves with the previous two installments

At any rate

Sadly

While I am most certainly guilty of allowing brief lapses of “Peter Pan Syndrome” in my life

However

Like any other social circle, this was everyone.

Truly, I must eat alone.

So eat alone I did—as mentioned in the previous chapter

Nirvana

For many a cheeseburger did I slowly munch away the delicious minutes of solitude in my concrete cubicle—all was right with the world.

That was of course until the air conditioner broke.

As though Eve herself had been tricked once more into eating the forbidden fruit

Not even my car which sat dutifully in the parking lot patiently awaiting my rump to grace its leather seats could spare me from the hell which had befallen me. Due to my status as a struggling university student on a strict budget

I would have to eat in the lunchroom.

This stark reality hit me harder than the sugar rush you get the first time you drink a Mountain Dew—and as I slowly made my way to the employee eatery my shaking hands only acted to complete the metaphor.

As I briskly seated myself in the furthest corner of the room

The room in and of itself was not notably horrid in any way—in fact I would go so far as to say that in the absence of people it would be a suitable place to eat. However, it still left much to be desired.

See, the small platoon of burgeoning berthas which made up the phone staff and various secretaries made up a good 70% of the ‘regulars.’

As anyone who has worked in an office complex will likely attest, and are larger than the secretaries and phone operators. Their rotund rears and blistering BMIs were already enough to drive even the hungriest of men to starvation, but their personalities would have been banned in the Geneva Convention.

In my first few weeks at the office, and of course who had gotten ‘fat’ were all just appetizers to their main course: groupthink.

I can only assume that as new secretaries are hired

Each more deluded then the last—while more than happy to sop up the newest juicy details like a fresh bun sops up mustard of how their bosses had ‘let themselves go

Their sheer bitchiness and undeserved narcissism had disgusted me to the point where I would wear headphones during eating—not necessarily the best option

In the wake of the air conditioner malfunction the lunchroom had taken on a new feel—that of a refugee camp. All the displaced prisoners of hot air had relocated themselves to the area for a breath of fresh air.

Needless to say

Of the 20 or so women (I use that term loosely) who made up the Berthas

While Planetary Patricia and most of the remaining cursory members of the Berthas fit well into a category of hamplanetry—they paled in comparison to Rotund Rachel. Indeed, with each feature attempting to distort itself further from the norm in an effort to be noticeable—this was aided in no way by her severe overuse of makeup. The Bertha’s clown-like war-paint was a point of constant ‘one up-ery’ within their pack, and Rotunda spared no expense in donning the suit of her ancestors. 

To only further complicate Rotundra’s myriad of problems, the only thing in the room that approached Rotundra’s massive size was her completely undeserved ego and pride—a dangerous combination, to say the least.

During my tenure at the office

However

So when it came down to the issue of the intruders in their territory

Over the next few days I began to notice a dwindling number of my comrades showing up for lunch. It made no sense however as the AC was still nowhere near fixed

“I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT ROTUNDRA!” shouted one of the Berthas.

“YEAH

“TEEHEEHE, BUT I GOTS A PLAN DON’T WORRY,” I heard Rotundra spit out along with her half eaten brownie.

The shrieking blubber butts continued their victory cheers with another wave of compliments for their lard-soaked leader

Rotundra basked in her undeserved glory and shook the table with her massive guttural laughs and sickening attempts at modesty. 

To the audience

However

Their overworked sweat glands feverishly tried to flood their bodies with cooling

Only a few members of the office refugees still remained dedicated to eating their lunch in a somewhat cool(er) space

The heat was getting to Rotundra

“YOU GUYS AREN’T WELCOME HERE

Tom from the tech department replied in my stead, do the math.”

Obviously shocked at his snappy response Rotunda proceeded to slam the table a few more times and scream at him

“Try me

As she readied herself for a full frontal assault on our foodstuffs and perhaps Tom himself

No way.

As she flailed around on the ground in true beached whale fashion

As fast as their kankles would allow them to travel

Rotundra was pronounced dead by the time the EMS medics made it down to the lunchroom—cause of death

Following Rotundra’s death

In her wake

In closing

**TL;DR – A pack of orcas attempt to maintain apex predator status in a concrete fish tank. Their leader pays the ultimate price for her status as queen beetus and her pack continues post-mortem.**

From where we last left off

&gt;Eris’s friend Britney arrive (White kind of chubby but cute) 

&gt;her friend Nekane arrives (Asian skinny anime type)

&gt;I go down to greet them
Okay so they are a bit shy

&gt;Doorbell rings

&gt;And with the fervor of a thousand suns

&gt;She comes upstairs holding a package and is ecstatic

&gt;Me: Eris what you get?

&gt;Eris: Oh my fucking god someone gets me a knife

&gt;We open it up

&gt;Eris: Finally I’ll be able to be lose weight

&gt;Eris proceeds to lecture us how great the pills 

&gt;Shows us the Dr. Oz clip

&gt;And if anyone was skeptical of the product she would reply ”Its PROVEN BY SCIENCE” 

&gt;Eris: I am so excited soon I won’t be able to fit into these clothes anymore lets go shopping!!

&gt;None of her friends had the courage to tell her it was a bad idea

&gt;We all go to the mall in Britney’s car 

&gt;We go into Abercrombie and Fitch

&gt;Eris: I love these jeans they are going to look so good on me.

&gt;Eris goes to try them on its obvious they aren’t going to fit

&gt;Me Britney and Nekane exchange looks we all have a big smile on our faces

&gt;Eris walks out of the fitting room... her entire gut is spilling over the jeans

I look at the jeans I am no psychologist but I could tell they were in duress

&gt;Jeans: Ares… kill me

&gt;I shed a tear

&gt;Eris I know they are a little tight

&gt;Me: Eris how’d you button them?

&gt;Eris: no ha-ha I just have my belt around them for now

&gt;Eris proceeds to look for more apparel but people are giving us dirty looks so I tell her we should go 
somewhere else

&gt;We continue shopping around and Eris continues to buy more clothes for when she is skinny. 

&gt;In total I’d say she spent ~$400 but it was out of necessity… soon she will be ‘too small’ for her clothes.

&gt;The entire time we are hanging out I have formed a friendship with Nekane and Britney simply from the looks we would exchange while watching Eris be a gluttonous idiot

&gt;Eris starts to realize that I am friends with them

&gt;When return home this time Eris protests to sit in the back next to me

&gt;Eris: hey Ares don’t you think I looked sexy in that t-shirt [Artist Depiction of how her arms looked like 
in that shirt]( http://i.imgur.com/zDdkz4j.jpg)

&gt;Awkward silence erupts no one says anything for the rest of the car ride

&gt;Eris: Mom!! The pills came in!!

&gt;Mom: good for you honey mine are on their way as well
have to starve yourself anymore

&gt;WAAAAAAAAAAAT Bitch has already been eating 5000 Calories + a day..

&gt;Mom: I will make you something special just don’t forget to stop taking your pills

&gt;Eris runs upstairs to put away her new clothes

&gt;Nekane and I  were sitting on the sofa and Britney was sitting on my lap. (It was nothing sexual there simply wasn’t enough room on the sofa)

&gt;Eris comes downstairs

&gt;Eris: hey Britney can you go be a slut somewhere else? Get off my brother do you have no fucking shame?

&gt;Britney goes and sits on the carpet… then Miss HeartAttackBeforeTheAgeOf30 jumps onto my lap (not hard)
I pushed her off before she could cut off blood flow to the rest of my body

&gt;Nekane: you just yelled at Britney for sitting on Ares’ lap why are you trying to sit on his lap; for god sake’s he is your brother

&gt;Eris: look we used to take baths together (yeah when we were 3) we are just that close

&gt;Eris: We also share a bedroom

&gt;Things get awkward

&gt;Mom calls up for dinner…..

&gt;What is this?

&gt;Mom: come on guys I made a chicken pot pie!

I inspect the pot pie, rice, butter, oil, and pieces of bacon. Nekane, Britney, and I just take small portions

&gt;Eris: finally I can eat without having to deny myself what I really want

&gt;Me: yeah Dr. Oz pills work it’s proven by science

&gt;Nekane: Yeah you can eat whatever you want and still lose weight

&gt;Britney: Its really good but dieting companies say it doesn’t work because they want people to buy 
their diets that don’t work so they can get more money

&gt;Eris and mom are too stupid to realize we are mocking them.

&gt;Britney and Nekane leave shortly after we finish dinner.

&gt;First time hanging out Eris’ friends like me more than her [yeah-buddy]( http://i.imgur.com/PEwcaNK.gif)


&gt;Later that night, instead mom and Eris go out to Baskin Robins for ice-cream…

&gt;They arrive home

&gt;Eris: hey Ares we brought you something to eat as well 

&gt;I look yes!! Oreo ice-cream cake my favorite

&gt;Mom: let’s have some now

&gt;I get a slice… A SLICE…and the Ham-nebulas consume the rest of the cake..

Holy shit these coffee extract pills better be working

&gt;Eventually go to bed

&gt;Eris comes into the room

&gt;Quickly mute my laptop

&gt;I look at Eris oh god… she is getting bolder and bolder… she is walking around in her underwear 

&gt;She is just so excited to show off her very soon to be bikini body..

&gt; The Mighty Oz and wondrous coffee pills have given the Devourer unbelievable confidence

&gt;I don’t make eye contact

&gt;Eris: hey

&gt;Me: we are just friends

&gt;Eris: thing is she already has a boyfriend and he is a really nice guy
wrecker

&gt; I see Britney’s face through Skype she is laughing her ass off.. Fatso is jealous of me and Britney.

&gt;Eris: On top of that she only likes black guys.
Coming from my sister… Yeah okay

&gt;I look at Britney again she is erupting with laughter

&gt;Me: Good night Eris.

&gt;Eris: look I am just telling you because you are my little brother and I care about you.

&gt;And again later that night Eris watches her hentai shit

&gt;I fall asleep.

1373043309.0,1hp6ew,How a hamplanet destroyed my first housewarming gift.,ZeframCochrane-,506,102,86,"I've been lurking and commenting here for quite awhile for lack of an actual story to share with the community.

Last night as I was sippin' an Arnold Palmer iced tea loaded with Svedka

This is a torrid tale of a hamplanet destroying the very first house warming gift I've ever gotten for my first apartment, but this also kind of involves dishing a friend of mine that was involved.

At 20 years old

Laroux was my g/f at the time of this story, he just has a thing for dating and fucking hamplanets.

Esteban's girlfriend at the time was of course a 350lb behemoth with your typical excuses ""I have a condition

One of the first encounters with her

The deal for the stereo was I would detail the interior of her car

Now usually

NOT THIS CAR. There was ketchup and BBQ sauce from McBeetus literally SMASHED into the carpeting in the back seats. Plastic container and all. Fries? Fries EVERYWHERE. Under the seats

A few weeks later, plus it was a sleeper, so if someone needed to stay because they were too wastey-pants they could sleep over, no harm, no foul.

Esteban and his BeetusQueen show up and get to moving things in

Never the less, LJ, Esteban and I all took bong hits while the BeetusQueen shoveled her BigMacs into her endless cocksucker that adorns her rotund fat-face. 

So

I had lived there since I was 10

Later on that night LJ and I were good and baked

As we were laying on the fold-out, like laying half-way out of a hole or something, we stopped the movie, pulled the mattress up and looked at the frame.

That's when we noticed one of the support bars. BENT TO SHIT

That hamplanet had bent the support just by sitting on it. That's where the mysterious noise came from. It was the sound of my very first and most treasured house warming gift committing suicide. 

We decided not to say anything

Later on

One night as we were getting stoned

&gt;they get seated at a table around the corner where we can see them

&gt;she has bleached her hair underneath and her bangs are stripes of pink and purple

&gt;we keep busting out laughing through the entire meal (club sandwiches and broccoli casserole FTW)

&gt;She prattles on about video games through most of the meal

&gt;she and kirby chaser snarf down 3 bacon cheeseburgers (this place has huge burgers) and at least 3 orders of fries a piece

&gt;my husband said he counted 18 cokes including the 3 they had at the beginning

&gt;we both get bill about the same time

&gt;Kirby flips

&gt;she didn't realize that this place charges after the 2nd refill (I dunno why, nevermind the fact the we heard the waiter tell them twice that they werent free)

&gt;thats 21 dollars in coke alone

&gt;i have to let it sink in once we did the math on their bill just how much they ate

&gt;kirby is yelling for a ""MAMAGER""

&gt;Nice man comes out and asks what he can help them with

&gt;Kirby screams that she wants the cokes taken off the bill and that if they werent she was suing the Cafe for discrimination by charging them for extra drinks because of their size

1371656308.0,1gnseo,Fat Logic at Blockbuster,JKatsopolis,487,82,70,"I came across this sub recently and after quenching my beetus I felt like I should try to return the favor. Sorry

This story took place a few years back. I was 21, but still fairly fit. Was with my friend Nate, 22, 5'10"", 200 lb, also a former gymnast. Still has the muscle, but put on quite a bit of weight.

We were exceptionally bored one night, head to the local Blockbuster. As was custom, we were looking for what seemed like hours for an agreeable movie. Probably ended up being around 20 minutes. Somewhere in that span Nate had suggested the movie Norbit. I laughed and said, ""Nah man,"" thinking that movie looked terrible. 

We finally agreed on something, a truck speeds across the parking lot and comes to a screeching halt right in front of us. A man in the driver's seat (I'd estimate 40, 5'8"", 350 lbs), let's call him Wannabe Hamuel L. Jackson screams through the opened window, ""Who the fuck do you think you are?!""

Nate and I shoot a confused glance at each other. ""Yeah

I respond

Hamuel replies, 250. Nate and I are really confused at this point. ""You were calling her Norbit!""

We put it together. In passing, we were in the movie store and saw that movie. I'm sorry if that caused any misunderstandings.""

""Bullshit! She's been crying here for the last 10 minutes about how you were calling her a whale and disgusting."" 

At this point I'm starting to get frustrated. I can see how an unfortunate coincidence like this could hurt her feelings. But, I'm sorry if we hurt her feelings, but it was an accident.”

“Why don’t you quit lyin’ about it and fess up?!”

“I don’t have time for this.”

""Yeah well what if I kick your asses?"" Hamuel starts to open his door. 

Alpha-mode Engage! I take a step toward his truck, I'll finish it. 

He finally sits back in his seat and closes his door. I start to say

He shouts, backs up, and peels out. Nate and I are left dumbfounded.

TL:DR Ham-beast in movie store overhears talk of Norbit. Makes up claims of harassment to her husband that harasses us with threats of violence and homophobic slurs.

You begged

Again, that nightmare was literally *behind* us. We’re astounded. There’s no *possible* way, after literally *attacking* a fellow student, that Nugget has been allowed to remain. We’ve been hanging out with Chris a lot less since he doesn’t seem to know whose side he’s on, but I text him asking why the hell Nugget is still here. He tells me that she’s been declared mentally unstable (*that* I can agree with) and that she’s been given some conditions for staying: she has to see a therapist. She can’t interact with me, Emily, or Devon. (Guess how long that lasts, I’m sure.) He then goes on to tell me the twisted logic behind the attack. It wasn’t just out of spite, or admit that I liked fat girls all along, pasta

So we have another few on-edge weeks. Every time Emily sees Nugget she freaks out. (Understandably.) We’re both worn thin and paranoid and it’s really starting to take a toll on us. I got switched into another English class, too. The subjects of her works were without fail obese women, and were usually accompanied by a fucking *essay* on the wall next to them about how oppressed she was. I guess she might have been an okay artist, I’m a terrible judge of things like that and I hated her so much it didn’t matter. This is important because one day, as Devon (a design and merchandising major) walked into the arts building, which has a gallery space on the bottom floor, she was confronted by a four-foot-tall painting of my face. Puzzled but amused, however, anorexically thin with blonde hair, I guess

The story has a happy ending, she could be rotting in a ditch by the side of the road. I hope you have enjoyed this rollercoaster of emotion and that the ending was satisfactorily sugary for all you fatties. Stay strong, stay curvy. Until next time.

TL;DR: Fattie is given a restraining order. Passive-aggressively makes an entire fucking art show about the incident. Gets kicked out. Everyone lives happily ever after.",self,t5_2vzax,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1itxvu/the_nugget_tales_the_grand_finale/

Yesterday got a bit chaotic as I am very busy/boyfriend was playing the majority of both shows that I was watching in the evening so I didn't actually get to hear about what the super secret chat was until I texted him today. Here's how it went, but it's as close to word for word as I could get: 

Me: 

Hey did you ever talk to [M]? She seemed pretty insistant. Everything go alright?

T: 

Oh god yeah. She took me for tea and made up some sort of intervention shit or whatever the hell. I learned new things about you though. 

Me: 

Uh oh. What have I been hiding now?

T: 

Well apparently you are a danger to yourself and the mental health of others and cannot possibly be okay in a commitment now

Me: 

Whoops. 

T: 

Mmm yeah you are too self absorbed for me and probably have some disorder or another

Me: 

Well

T: 

Bang on. 

Me: 

Oh shit. Okay. My bad. 

T: 

Hahahahaha. 

But seriously then she told me I deserve someone better and said she's only going on about it because she cares. This point I'm figuring what the hell.

Asked her right out if it's because she wants to date and she admitted it. 

She fucking said yeah. 

Me: 

Well at least she was honest. 

T: 

Well fuck if I could figure out what to say. 

I told her everything I'd done was just as a friend and I'm sorry but I'm committed. 

Then she's just crying everywhere. 

I want to say literally blubbering. 

Me: 

LOL. 

T: 

You know she fought that. Said we had something and you've taken it. 

I asked her what she thought we had and she said things about fucking eye contact or sometimes I smile at her or something but seriously what the fuck is wrong with women?

Sorry no some women. =)

There was some bullshit about touching arms or something. Saving the best for last here

Me: 

Some love at first sight crap? Please let that be it. 

T: 

Nicknames. She made up her shit nickname for me 'cause she thought I'd given her one. 

Because sometimes I called her mate. 

She thought it was a fucken joke or something

Me: 

LOL WHAT.

T: 

I'd never hit a lady but good god I came close. 

Just a smack right in the mouth would have been perfect. 

That's how I tell my dog when she's being stupid

Me: 

Okay, I am going to destroy your beautiful pure soul, and you're only British sometimes for flirtation and/or shits and giggles. 

T: 

Right. 

**To follow up** 

I did talk to him on the phone briefly but there's not much more to add to that. Apparently it was a long talk, and that she was more of a woman than me because she actually had some sort of compassion. 

So basically she tried to ""win him from me"" by calling herself a good person while trash talking me (to my boyfriend) for a couple of hours. Solid logic bro. 

Also, at least for a while, and she cried (lol, blubbered) harder and blamed me.

This weekend I held a little barbeque at my place. I had a few of my friends graduate from Uni, Hammila wouldn't fathom sharing her food with others. How wrong I was. 

Fast forward to Sunday morning, gas station, or anything like that. It has one restaurant/bar/coffeehouse along the highway, and nothing else. The nearest town is almost 25 miles away, and barely bigger than this town). Silver and I braced ourselves for a barbeque with the beast. I declined needing anything from the store, and told her whatever her mom brings would be okay. She took off town the street to report back to her mom. 

1pm exactly I see the girl running up to the house, and after hearing her complain about walking up my driveway. Silver snickered that she probably had to decide on eating food now, or waiting an hour for her husband to come home. Silver mentioned that the last bbq that was held was a few years ago, and Hammila wouldn't walk over and sent her daughter to get food for her. I was quietly hoping that she would grab some food, and leave as well. 

My graduate friends started to fill in, and tends to get taken advantage of, and athleticchick, who competes in half-marathons, marathons, and triathlons all throughout the year. They see Hammila coming, and AC laughs that free food will bring all the rats out of their homes.

A little info on AC: She is a brash

After 20 minutes, and I insticually back up. She frowned, and told us about how hard the walk was from her house. 
""You don't understand

[OFW we run on dirt roads all the time](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/oh-please.gif) 

I tell her to help herself to a drink (Lemonade, beer and coffee), and go off to start some of these
 [delicious chicken kabobs](http://www.cookingmamas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ChiliLimeChickenKabobs.jpg). 

At the grill, and was loudly complaining,

""Can you believe it? There isn't anything to drink at this barbeque""

AC: ""Oh

Hammila:""Naw

At this point, and remind Hammila that I made coffee especially for her. She starts to complain:

""I cann't drink that! I just walked here from my house! Do you want me to die of dehydration? You know what caffeine does

AC:""Well there's plenty of water bottles over there so you can rehydrate after that ""horrible rigorous exercise'.""

Hammila: I can't have too much water. I'm allergic to it. Every time I drink it

[MFW I realize she is serious](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/question-mark.gif)   

[AC and Silver'sFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lol.gif)

AC decides to jump on this, right?""

Hammila: ""Not me. I've only drank water about twice this year.""

AC:""You are aware that soda is made with water too? And coffee?""

[Cue Hammila's freak out](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Brock_Lesnar.gif)

""What are you? A doctor? You wouldn't know anything

She huffed off to the table full of barbeque, and stacked them on eachother. She stumbled down the driveway, and waited a half hour for her husband to pick her up and drive her home. She must have been upset, because she didn't even realize that she left her daughter there with us (She was in the back playing with my puppy). We told her that her mom left, but if she wanted to stay longer, she could. I learned that she doesn't like to eat meat, so I made her a veggie burger and let her play with the dog more.  In all honesty

She told us that they mainly eat prepackaged meals in her house, AC spent some time with her and hopefully made her worry less. 

I thought that this little freak out would have been the last I would have to deal with Hammila, is a story in itself. 

TL;DR:Have a barbeque with college friends, and tells us that she is allergic to water. She gets called out on it, and fills plates full of food and leaves (while leaving her daughter at my house).

I feel like there aren't enough blue links right now

Your intrepid author here was feeling low. Down in the dumps. I had been unemployed for nearly 4 months now, and generally everything sucked. So when a friend finally mentioned there were some positions going in the store he worked at, and that he'd put my resume in for me and give me a leg up, I jumped at the chance! I was so excited for a chance at working, I didn't care what it was. I went for the interview, which turned out to be a group thing, and instead of sticking me in a tech job or a cashier's spot

&gt;Beggerscantbechoosers.jpeg

It was a bit of a walk to work and back

&gt;workin off dem chubbs

&gt;gettin fit and sexy

&gt;awwyisss

I rushed home ecstatic that I'd finally be getting work! I'd finally have income! And I wanted to celebrate!

I texted Spouse-a-tron to pick up steak because I had some good news

Spouse-a-tron is very picky about his steak, legs akimbo, pokeballs shining in the afternoon light.

&gt;Snorlax used BLIND. It was super effective.

Averting my eyes

**""What's got you in such a good mood

It was very difficult not to hear him muttering **""Or someone who pays better at dick sucking?""** like I couldn't blates hear him from the other room.

&gt;excuseme@yahoo.com?

I calm myself, and he'll just lie later. I count backwards from ten, and make like I'm putting some groceries away.

""No, I have a job, I start Monday. I'm just happy to have work is all.""

**""Oh is that all? About fucking time. Now you can pull your own weight like a real person instead of being some deadbeat mooching girlfriend.""**

""Fuck you, do you think I don't know that Spouse-a-tron has been covering me for rent? Don't you think I don't feel shitty enough as it is without your hypocritical ass rubbing it in?""

&gt;Note: Beetus was always 15 days late with the rent.

&gt;claimed work paid him every 4 weeks midway through the month

&gt;bullshit.

&gt;He would spend all his money on payday on a month's worth of frozen meals and vidyagames.

&gt;Wait midway through the month

&gt;Mummy sends him fat cash for rents and more food and games.

**""Whut, accept a compliment, I was saying congratulations, but I guess you don't understand it. Just like you don't understand my *conditions*. Fucking women.""**

&gt;my facelessness is infinite

""Beetus

**""My bank charges me per transaction and Direct Debits...It's super expensive for me it's cheaper just to give you guys cash.**

&gt;I have same kind of account at same bank as Beetus.

&gt;Direct Debit is free to another UK account.

&gt;All transactions are free including, withdrawals at any cashpoint, etc.

&gt;I call horseshit.

""Beetus don't you have Royal Bank of Derp? A Key account?""

**""Yeah

Because I think your mother

Beetus's beady eyes narrow in his sweaty brows.

**""What do you mean?""**

""Beetus I have the same account type as you. I phoned the bank yesterday to find out whether there were any account types that charged for transactions. Also the company you work for uses the same payroll office as mine

&gt;We'd literally had this argument yesterday

&gt;so full of shit.

**""You can't prove anything!""**

""After how much of a dick you've been

**""You're all just fucking stupid. It's because you and Landlady are all hormonal and you take each other's sides because bitches do that. And Spouse-a-tron only believes you because you suck his dick. That's why you're with him

&gt;namecalling

&gt;lovely.

&gt;It's like preschool all over again.

Beetus is flailing madly at this point

&gt;OHGODMYEYES

&gt;THEYBURN

I just want him out of the room. I snap.

""Beetus, and nobody wants to see your sweaty unwashed micropenis. Go put some fucking clothes on before I call the cops on you for verbal and sexual harassment as well as public indecency. You know there's a fucking preschool and playground not 20 feet from the window in the front room? They can see everything you're doing. You're lucky you're not on the sex offenders registry for being naked in the front room. That was a new fucking couch and not only have you broken the support struts, but your greasy ball sweat is now all over it. You and your fucking room reek of death. Fucking fix it before I make sure you get kicked out.""

&gt;I don't actually know if public decency laws apply to communal house areas

&gt;The front room and patio door are glass and as yet had no curtains. Preschool not 20 feet across the grassy bit from us had a great view of this fuck every morning.

&gt;Exposing himself to kids accidentally.

Beetus is a little unsure of himself, and humid environments and too much light aggravating his conditions. He doesn't come out even for dinner.

&gt;Maybe he's dead.

When he thinks we're asleep

Next morning I find he's eaten all of our stuff in the fridge AND freezer.

**Chapter Eight**

Saturday evening started as little more than an unmemorable string of attempts to keep myself distracted. Lauren, a fact which I constantly repeated to myself each time that I compulsively checked my email (and found only an empty inbox). Porcina, meanwhile, was allegedly in attendance at a bachelorette party, giving me the opportunity to sign in to my instant messenger without fear of encountering her electronic entrapment. I tried to picture, with some amusement, how a theoretical stripper would react to her presence

I shared these thoughts with a friend, via a litany of instant messages, been regaled with the entire story of Porcina's advertisement, the picture it had contained, my subsequent date with the diva of disaster, and my ongoing pursuit of the lovely Lauren. He wondered – and rightly so – why I had chosen to avail Porcina of my presence at the mall, a question for which I had no reasonable answer. Perhaps it was a sense of disgusted fascination, as revolting was it is to a consider

Jeff had frequently been (and still is) a voice of reason in my life, he asked, had I not simply blocked Porcina from my online interactions, if I was so hell-bent on avoiding her? Had I ever said, directly, that I wasn't interested in the young woman's affections? How would she interpret my intentions after I'd spent an entire day as an accomplice to her objectionable behavior? Was I really so afraid of going without sex that I'd stoop to sleeping with someone like Porcina?

My rationalizations were many, she was still a prospect in my mind. An undesirable one, to be sure... but a prospect nonetheless. For all my charm and bravado, I was still the gangly teenager, so desperate to be desired that I'd entertain any offer. It was a sobering realization, full of uncomfortable ramifications and ego-shattering conclusions, like being held beneath a microscope that revealed every crack and flaw in my self-image. My prior honesty to Lauren would be meaningless if I couldn't pay myself the same courtesy, but was I any better if I continued to lead her on?

There was only one option. Jeff agreed: I would have to confront Porcina.

The night gave way to morning with no contact from either girl, I reasoned, that Lauren was simply working again... but Porcina, with her subsidized rent and seemingly endless free time, should have shown her zaftig face by then. Though I was hardly enthusiastic about the prospect of my looming ultimatum, I was even less enamored with all time spent in waiting for it. I had rejected the idea of simply sending an email, both because Jeff had encouraged me to be direct, the delay was excruciating.

At last,” was all that it said.

“Hi

“I want to see you.”

My heart pounded. *This was it*. I took a deep breath

There was a pause

“I don't want to lead you on, but eventually decided on staying concise. There was no need to further complicate things with explanations, after all.

Porcina's next question surprised me

To her credit, if one discounted the electronic medium. “We're not fucking,” I finally replied. “And we're not going to.”

With no answer or warning

I took a deep breath and let loose a sigh of relief. My hands were still shaking, and I took it as a sign of self-improvement. My perpetual paranoia led me to wonder what the fallout would be for (and possibly with) Lauren, but in the moment, I felt accomplished.

My triumph was short-lived. A few seconds later

“(Acronym for laughing.) Sorry!” she typed. “My Internet died! I'm back now!”

I grudgingly sent my response. “Did you get my last message?”

“(Acronym for laughing.) No. What did it say?”

“I said, “that we are not fucking, and that we're not going to.”

A file transfer began... and like a fool

I confess,” I wrote back.

Then

That may seem like an insignificant event, I had *always* kept *every* picture, sent to me by *any* girl I had ever interacted with in such a way. It wasn't like typical pornography, I had told myself, which could be found again with some creative web-crawling. Pictures sent by people I *knew*, well, they were something special, it was an inspiring victory against an unlikeable part of my own mind.

Unfortunately,” she said. “Also, for breakfast and lunch.” I began to type my protests, but another message came through: “Since you're poor, you can work it off,” followed by yet another acronym for laughing.

“Lauren got us breakfast for free

“I bought food for both of us

“I didn't eat *any*. Not even a mint.” I poured my frustration into my next lines. “I'll pay you back for dinner

Another period of online silence ensued. Had I finally vanquished my foe? Her response seemed to imply as much, but I considered it a small price to pay. “I'm at home,” Porcina finished.

“You want it now, the better. Also, the possibility of finding Lauren present was alluring in its own right.

“Yes

I reached for my coat as I typed my last line. “I'll be right over.”

Little did I know

1371012328.0,1g6dbo,Thin Privilege and the Bicycle.,chesZilla,473,81,74,"Today was hot. Topping 31 C (around 88F) it was warmer than it had been for the past week. I was indulging in some laziness today, it was too hot out. I spent most of the day in shorts, today was extra hard. After class

I feel this icy chill down my spine just as I jump on the elliptical machine. The AC on high? No, and changes her smile to a saccharine grin which only barely hides the contempt she holds. Planet Chubbs is approximately 5'7 with a circumference of about 7 feet. Planet Chubbs looks to weigh maybe 400 lbs. I twitch slightly in fear, and go to the weights. Maybe if I stay far away I won't get sucked into her gravitational pull.

Later I head to the bikes. All five are empty, and I'm oblivious to the world.

I feel a tap on my shoulder. I assume it is just the wire from my mp3 player. I ignore it. Then my earphone is yanked out of my ear. I snap out of my mental Blondie impersonations and look around confused. The machine stops as I stop treading. Planet Chubbs has stood next to me and has just pulled out my earbud.

""You're on my machine.""

""You just fucking ripped out my earbud.""

""Well you weren't listening. You're on my machine.""

I am understandably irate at this point. I don't give a toss if you're the Queen. You rip out an earbud

As I start to explain this concept to her

""It's the only machine that will hold me. You're on my machine.""

There is a sticker that says it supports up to 500lbs. None of the other cycles have this.
Perhaps I reacted to harshly

""Oh

Planet Chubbs rolls her eyes in a mental ""whatever"". I move to the next machine and begin again. Planet Chubbs mounts the cycle in a hideous parody of real exercise. Planet Chubbs's derriere doesn't fit on the already generous seat. It droops down on either side of the cushions like jello. Planet Chubbs is wearing a stretch jersey knit black tshirt. Planet Chubbs must think going to the gym is a social activity, mascara...the works.

She adjusts the cycles built in TV to put on Family Derp. Instead of pedaling she just moves the upper pedal back and forth a quarter of a turn. I wonder if this is some new workout. Then it hits me. This is the minimum activity to keep the tv going. Planet Chubbs must have noticed my attention

""What?"" I ask.

""Doncha just LOOOOVE these built in TVs? I wish I had cable this nice at home.""

I look at the xeroxed and laminated channel list attached to the walls. It's not cable

I shrug noncommittally in reply.

""I come here for the TV."" She explains.

""Mmmph."" I respond politely

Moments later she waves her sweaty pudgy hands inches from my face. I start back and pull the earbud out. At this point I want to just leave

Planet Chubbs speaks again. Every roll of flab vibrates with the sounds and the reverberations from her not-pedaling.

""YOU'RE EXERCISING TOO MUCH. I JUST SAW YOU COME OUT OF THAT YOGA CLASS. YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK YOUR SPINE.""

For reference, so I look like a broomhandle with balloons taped to my chest. I am not the thinnest of women, but I'm nowhere near this Planetoid's level of unfitness.

""Pardon?"" I say

""GURL LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE ANOREXIC AND YER GONNA BREAK YER SPINE IF YOU EXERCISE THAT MUCH. MY DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT. THAT'S WHY I TAKE IT SLOW LIKE THIS.""

I give Planet Chubbs a look

""WHY YOU GOTTA BE LEAVIN? I'M JUST BEING NICE. I'M TRYING TO **HELP** YOU.  ANOREXIC GIRL LIKE YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET A MAN TA TREAT YOU RIGHT IF YOU AIN'T GOT CURVES LIKE ME.""

Curves? Try folds. Try rolls of fat

As I grab my bag from the coat rack she slings one last volley.

""YEAH BITCH, WHORE.""

Planet Chubbs got a long ass complaint made about her to the staff. Guess who already had several strikes on her membership for abusing the time limit (and number of children limit) at the gym's drop in daycare.

In this great sun burnt country

While I don't like to call them all 'welfare bums', for those not in the 'know'), and no job security due to casual jobs being the only available source of income in the area. They can be fired at a moments notice, and often are, due to bad service, being late, or having to deal with their children over work.

All in all, you will see a lot of the younger teens having kids to get that $4000 baby bonus, so they can add some 'sick rims' to their Holden Commodores (Or as you American folk know them as, Pontiac's or Chevrolets... that's right, you're using Aussie chassis'!).

Now, ease of accessibility to funds and junk food, and a lifestyle mainly revolving around episodes of Oprah and The Home Shopping Network, this can lead to some Class A FPS and fat logic.

So, they can not afford air conditioning. This can be quite a problem in Australia, where par boiling vegetables is done by leaving a pot of water in the sun, and we don't so much have barbecues, just plates of metal we put meat on to cook in the natural heat.

So the solution? Ride the public transport system. 

One particularly hot day, as one would expect during peak hour.

Hello everyone! I bring another tale of the Fat-shion Designer and how I thought for half a second that she had a chance of making it. I apologize for the extreme length of this one

&gt;Classes have been in session for about two weeks and I’ve already learned that the actual school part of college is a total drag^teehee

&gt;Be at dining commons at 7am before abysmally early class

&gt;I am a zombie mindlessly choking down flavorless oatmeal and trying to remember why the hell I ever thought an 8am class was a good idea. 

&gt;The ground begins trembling and an ominous booming alerts me to an impending earthquake. 

&gt;Before I can heave my tired body up and safely store it under the table

&gt;”HEY LADYDRAGQUEEN WHAT’S UP?”

&gt;Oh it’s just Cocoa

&gt;”Can I sit here?”

&gt;”Sure you can sit here” my mouth Benedict Lard-nolds me in favor of politeness. “What brings you here so early?”

&gt;”I like to get here when they first open and stay until my 9:30am class so I can make sure to be the first one to taste all the different foods they put out.” She proceeds to set down a massive tray of food and plop into a chair.

&gt;Chair begins weeping and bemoaning the sorrows of its people.

&gt;”I was thinking lately that maybe I could stand to lose a little weight” she says

&gt;[”Oh

&gt;”Yeah

&gt;*BAD IDEA SAY NO SAY NO* “Of course I’ll help you

&gt;Why do I do this to myself? 

&gt;”Well

&gt;Explains THE SEVERITY OF HER CONDISHUNS with “It’s just so hard to drop any extra weight I might put on over a holiday. I mean look

&gt;[MFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/ff9e5cd164ed72ef2f8731864906eea7/tumblr_mnd3bxVVma1s8or22o1_250.gif) I’m eating one bowl of oatmeal and she has a large heaping plate of eggs and potatoes

&gt;WAIT A MINUTE WASN’T I ANOREXIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO?

Regardless

After classes that night

&gt;omgshe’sreallygonnamakeit.hopeandchange

&gt;Show Cocoa how I use a smaller plate so I’m not tempted to fill it up with more than I need. She looks inspired.

&gt;Split up to get food

&gt;Return to the table and she is carrying what can only be described as the Mt. Everest of meals.

&gt;She has one plate

&gt;ESL stares at me with a look of horror similar to someone watching kittens get kicked down a staircase.

&gt;”So much food! You must be hungry to eat big gross pile of slop.”

&gt;”I haven’t eaten all day!” Still

&gt;We seize the opportunity and convince her to only eat about half of the mound and even pick at a plate of fruit ESL fetched her. 

&gt;Minus a few complaints about not having enough food

&gt;When the meal is over and exercise time rolls around

&gt;Cocoa and I bid the others goodbye and make our way out into the world for a jog.

&gt;It is August and we are in the desert. To say that it’s hot outside would be like saying that Michael Jackson had a little work done. 

&gt; We are outside for approximately 15 second before Cocoa starts sweating like she just single-handedly built the pyramids. I'm slightly sweaty myself. 

&gt;Gotta be brave

&gt;Try to start with a small jog. Cocoa takes approximately four bouncey steps with her breast-flaps walloping her in the face before she huffs out that jogging is bad.

&gt;Humor her and slow down to a power walk.

&gt;And by power walk

&gt;After about a sixth of a mile: “Working your body this hard doesn’t do anything for your health except ruin it! Let’s go back!”

&gt;I have never had such a low intensity workout in my life. 

&gt;We turn around because I’m sure it’s hard to be physically active when carrying around the weight of two people

When we get back to the suite (wait why did she come back with me? She doesn’t even live here!)

Now, on day one we established an “always knock before entering private area or bathroom” rule. Cocoa does not give a flying fig about rules.

&gt;Been asleep for what feels like 10 minutes when I feel myself being vigorously shaken awake. 

&gt;Like any classy lady

&gt;It’s Cocoa

&gt;”What do you do when you feel hungry and it’s late?”

&gt;”YOU GO TO FUCKING SLEEP AND YOU CAN GOBBLE UP THE WORLD AGAIN TOMORROW”

&gt;”But if I starve myself

&gt;Bitch

&gt;”I TRYING TO SLEEP OVER HERE

&gt;ESL’s threat of action is sufficient enough to send Cocoa scurrying out of the room

&gt;I am a mature adult so I sit in the laundry room all night and whine on the phone to my mother about how college is miserable. 

Over the course of the next few days, until one night she reveals the fat logic slowly spreading throughout her massive body.

&gt;Going to the gym! Wave bye to KaiKai and Cocoa in living area and prepare to set out.

&gt;[MFW] (http://media.tumblr.com/f16530b0cfaf32507bf78ac2f79d0ac2/tumblr_inline_mlmio71ZZm1qz4rgp.gif) Cocoa asks to come along and I actually wanted to do real exercise. 

&gt;Say sure

&gt;We get to the gym and I find out she’s never actually been inside of a gym and has no idea how any of the machines work.

&gt;What.

&gt;Show her how to set the treadmill to a slight incline and a slow pace

&gt;Workout zone ruined by a rather gruesome thump

&gt;Turn around

By the time I make my way over to her, but she was still pissed and embarrassed. 

&gt;Give her a hug

&gt;""Don't worry

&gt;""I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO

&gt;""Whoa

&gt;""IT'S NOT JUST A FALL! I'M ONTO YOU! I KNOW YOU'RE MAKING THIS DIFFICULT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS OF ME!""

&gt;Whoever said that faith can move mountains is wrong.

&gt;""YOU KNOW I'M PRETTIER THAN YOU AND YOU'RE AFRAID THAT IF I LOSE THESE LAST FEW POUNDS THAT YOU'LL LOOK EVEN UGLIER NEXT TO ME

&gt;Unlike the heaving ham in front of me

&gt;""Look, that's your health at stake and not mine. I know that *I'll* live to see my 30's and that's all that matters to me.""

&gt;""Don't act like you're so much healthier than I am! ThunderThighs in the room across from us (us? Since when did she become an official roommate?) told me about this modern theory called HAES

&gt;""HAES is a bunch of bullshit spread around by lazy people who don't want to put in the work it takes to lose weight""

&gt;""ThunderThighs SAID that thin people are against anything that shakes their feelings of superiority. I don't know why I ever let you and ESL pressure me to change my body. I'm so done with this.""

ESL and I have never made any comment about the way she looks and we have both actively avoided engaging her on the issue of body image

I guess being thin in her presence now qualifies as fat-shaming. And so ends any slight exertion by Cocoa towards bettering herself. [F for effort.] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7skwbSzZ1rosb88o1_500.gif) 

TL;DR: Cocoa asks me to help her lose weight and is poisoned with HAES while simultaneously realizing that getting fit is not all fun and games. She decides that I personally constructed the concept of calories in/calories out in order to make her quit because I'm so jealous of her womanly glory.

When I arrived at the venue for the wedding (country club), but upon closer inspection I realized that he had been sweating so much that his once light-blue shirt was now stained a dark navy-blue. My wife follows him down the stairs and hands me a beer (she knows me well).  

Fatographer, YOU KNOW, I'M WORKING.

He waddles away and my wife tells me that he's only been upstairs once so far. 

Once down the stairs, where is the Fatographer?  Still on the couch, mopping up his brow while occasionally taking a shot from a sitting position. He looks winded, he looks tired, and he's only been there for 20 minutes.

15 Minutes before the ceremony, dad, grandmom, etc), and she'd like to get pictures.""

I go and look for him and find him on the same couch in the foyer

He eyes the stairs

He's going to miss this quintessential moment (one the bride is specifically asking to capture) because he doesn't want to climb stairs for a second time?!? That's his job! 

Whatever, but the most versatile one I have at the moment). But I guess something is better than nothing.

[This part isn't really a FPS

As I'm heading back down the stairs to go outside and sit for the ceremony

I rattle off the specs before I look to see what he's got.  Now, one of the most common being that, when working and event, you should have several different lenses on you. Preferably a couple prime (fixed) lenses as they are usually a bit better quality and have a wider aperture range than variable (zoom) lenses.  This guy has the same crappy variable kit lens as me and an old external flash (non-adjustable). No gear bag, no extra lenses, no light meter. He didn't even have a spare battery! He was utterly clueless when it came to what type of file format he was shooting in (jpeg vs. RAW) and had, at best, f-stops

[End photo rant]

The not going up the stairs thing is what really rustled my jimmies

He apparently forgot about his no-beer-while-working policy since

At the reception

During the best-man/maid-of-honor speeches

When it was time for the bride/dad, I looked around and realized he was in line for the buffet.

He missed a lot of good moments due to his laziness and unwillingness/inability to move around and get in position.

Am instilling wonderful history into their dear little brains.

We get to the part of the tour where I point out a set of 17th century carved wooden chairs. At this point I select a girl from the tour (choosing carefully based on what weight the chairs can take) and get her to sit in a certain chair- then I reveal that our Queen has sat in that chair and this makes the girl very nearly a princess!! (The little girls love this).

Suddenly a booming voice comes from the back of the tour.. 'Can I have a go in the chair?'

I look...  The voice is coming from a woman who is the same height as me but must weigh 350lbs!  There is no way I would let her sit in ANY of these chairs. I say that no

She makes chuntering and muttering noises as we move to the next room

Voice booms out again. 'Well how about THOSE chairs? Can I have this turn?'

I stammer a bit and explain no-one can use those chairs

Voice booms 'you would have let someone sit in it! It's just because I'm larger! You should let me sit in one!'

And I shit you not

1376080600.0,1k1rx0,The final woeful story from a hospital employee. Saved the worst for last [Warning: Gross &amp; Long],vondahl,464,73,101,"Although I came across more than a few morbidly obese patients during the year I worked in the medical field at this bariatric center of excellence

This particular experience happened when I was working as a transporter and not as a phlebotomist like my other two stories.

Transporters are the people who take patients from their rooms to go get X-Rays or CT scans and the like

Depending on the patient's ambulatory abilities

I got a lot of smack working in transport. I am average height, I was able to do my job just fine!

Except for this one day. This one day

It was a fairly slow day. We're all sitting in the break room, stocky, really strong bitch - SB from now on) offers to help.

We go upstairs to Medical (top floor) and grab the patient's chart. The info is on a need-to-know basis. I don't know WHY this guy is in the hospital, oxygen flow, and his weight... Holy shit.

His weight. Over 500lbs.

Even in this ham-friendly environment

We go into his room and see this sedated pile of melting swiss cheese with some hair on top, but it won't budge. Check the brakes, they're unlocked... fuck.

After much pushing, we finally get this hamplanet (he takes the word to a new level) moving. The elevator feels so far away at this point. With normal bed jobs, you give a hard push to get some momentum going, and then just guide the bed. Not this one, though. We are giving it everything we have, and it's going at a snail's pace. 

Finally get to the elevator and to the floor that has the GI lab on it. What a surprise

I think I might be crying at this point

Finally, demanding that the men take this guy back upstairs when the job comes through. Fuck equality. They're stronger and I am not embarrassed to admit it. 

Now

As soon as the elevator opened, this was the worst. It was... oh god. My eyes were watering and I thought I was going to vomit. I made a mental note to ask my dad (an ICU nurse) if he knew what that smell was since he was working this day as well.

Do my job, and I ask him about the smell that destroyed the entire floor for the entire day. The ventilation is really bad in the old hospital...

SO apparently the ICU had a new admit today. Huge, too. 

I ask my dad if the guy was in the 500's, I guess.

My dad says that he was the assigned nurse for hambeast 500 that day. He had inserted a rectal catheter (sorry, he hears this dripping sound. 

His back to the patient

He calls for help, the sheets, the floor, *everything* is covered in shit. One of the nurses calls for housekeeping to come NOW. 

One of the lovely ladies comes with her cleaning cart, so she just left the cart with my dad and his coworkers. 

The nurses roll up the legs of their scrubs like they're going clamming

I will never, literally covered in shit, cleaning up, and laughing about it. I have the utmost respect for nurses...

Anyway, doing his nurse thing. 

Dripping.

He winces and slowly turns around to find that this guy was not done yet. Another river of shit starts splashing all over the place. My now, so now there's just shit all over his feet too. 

Rinse and repeat. Shit waterfalls, change the sheets, etc. Took another hour or so. I asked my dad how he and his coworkers could just *laugh* at this. I guess sometimes you just laugh so you don't lose your fucking mind.

I was confused when my dad had called me from work and grimly asked to grab socks and pants out of his closet before my shift started that day. Everything comes full circle

**Waaay TL;DR - Encounter 500lb whale, smell this awful shit that wrecked an entire floor in the hospital. Ask ICU nurse dad, turns out the beast was constipated for weeks, had multiple failed enemas, and finally exploded (twice) sending shit rivers from his bed, all over the entire room. He died the next day.**",,self,,

For those who haven't seen my [first story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1di0h8/my_first_experience_with_hamlogic/), it's not going to happen.

Be me, putting up displays and joking around with awesome boss. Enter regular customer hamplanet, who we'll call Curve Queen (CQ). This woman is about 6', 380 lbs, maybe more. Always uses her EBT card to buy the worst possible food. I don't think she ever went near a produce section in her life. CQ wasn't ever all that bad, but she did make it her personal goal to flirt with every male working in the store while she shopped. It got to the point where the men of my store would run in terror and hide somewhere customers weren't allowed. On this particular day, the only man aside from my boss that was working in the store was a cashier that I happened to be dating at the time (we're just gonna call him BF because I am not very creative). I think you can see where this is going. No one except our boss knew we were dating (he saw BF pick me up from work one night and asked me about it the next day); we liked to keep things on the down low at work because we didn't want to deal with any drama from our other coworkers. The boss didn't give a shit as long as we did our work and didn't “disappear” together while we were supposed to be working.

On the way to the checkout line, BF is a grown man that can take care of himself. The boss and I casually move to a different display near the checkstand area so we can get a good listen.

CQ: “So, I'm available whenever teehee!”

The boss and I suppress our laughter and make gagging faces at each other then suppress more laughter.

BF: “I do have a girlfriend

[MFW](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/oh-stop-it-you.png) I get called a “lovely lady.”

CQ: “You don't have a girlfriend

BF: “No ma'am

CQ: “Oh yeah? Show me a picture of her then!”

I see him pull out his phone and panic for a second

CQ: “Why are you dating some anorexic bitch? You need to get with a real women like me

At this point it takes all the willpower in the world for my boss and I to suppress our gagging and laughter. We almost lost it when she referred to herself as “curvy”.

BF: “Disrespecting my girlfriend is no way to even begin winning me over. I don't appreciate you calling her anorexic

CQ huffs and snaps, that's a well known fact! She's even got you so whipped that you are too afraid to break up with her for a real woman!”

At this point my boss and I have migrated down an aisle and are nearly in hysterics. I can see BF looking around for someone to back him up

CQ: “And what about you

I look up and realize she is talking to me so I just nod and go back to pretending to work.

CQ: “I don't know why any guy would date you

Without thinking, obviously I'm doing something right seeing as how I'm the one that has a boyfriend.”

CQ begins to move toward me and I instinctively reach for my box cutter as I am cornered. The boss and BF move in her way because they know I will cut a bitch to get out of being cornered.

CQ: “I'll knock your skinny ass out! How dare you back sass me

Me: “Why don't you just leave? You're only embarrassing yourself.”

CQ pushes past my boss and my boyfriend and I make my box cutter visible. She backs up a bit and just stares.

CQ: “You wouldn't...”

Me: “I don't like being threatened and I don't like being cornered. Now

CQ goes back to the register to pay for her heaps of chips, I used to smoke, no, I don't anymore. Get off my tits.) After watching CQ get in her car and drive off, we go back inside to let BF take a break. I teased BF for the next week about him needing a “real, curvy woman” and he teased me about needing to eat more. Every time CQ came in after that day, BF and I would just glance at each other and crack up.

TL;DR I will cut a bitch

**Chapter Thirteen**

Lauren looked at me with a mixture of surprise and concern. “Porcina didn't tell you she has a boyfriend? Wow

A hurricane of questions circled in my mind. I picked one at random and voiced it. “Why was she posting on Craigslist in the first place?”

“They have an *open relationship*

I laughed out loud at that. “Probably not

“Oh, Porcina plays the jealousy card pretty often.”

Not to mention pretty ineffectively, make for an interested lover. I wondered about the character of a man who would date Porcina. Maybe it was a fetish thing, or a desire for domineering women? “What's he like?” I asked, realizing that the answers might be readily available.

“Quiet

I was (and am) something of a gamer myself,” I replied. “He was pretty addicted, too.”

“It's not my thing, he's coming to visit. Porcina should lose interest in you then.”

“And after that?” I queried

Lauren shrugged her shoulders. “After that... probably. As long as she doesn't think *you're* interested.”

“Trust me, and looked into her eyes. “Would you still like to go out sometime?”

Like it had the evening before, I remembered the look of anger I had seen on Lauren's face, but I quickly dismissed it as having been annoyance with her roommate. Lauren met my eyes and narrowed her gaze, as if trying to read the images in my brain. I didn't know whether I was grateful or disappointed that telepathy was an impossibility. 

“Well...” Lauren began

“I'm trying to be, possessing of an especially immaculate history. I'd been lazy with my relationships and callous with my partners' emotions. I had haunted Craigslist like a marauding spirit, ready to swoop down and whisper whatever half-truths would lead to nudity. There had been a few special women, sure: The Russian immigrant who was impossibly smart, but whose intentions I had misunderstood. The outgoing freshman whom I'd inadvertently stifled, then driven away with my criticism. The opera student, so full of ambition, and with each passing visage

I had been a *dick*.

There was no way,” I said, “but I do think you're really great. I know this hasn't been the *greatest* start... but maybe we can try again?”

Lauren kept her focus locked firmly on my eyes. Then she blinked

“Sounds great!” I exclaimed. “The date

“You pick out the restaurant.” Lauren's smile returned. “I'll pay for my half.”

The next week was a blaze of color, I insisted to them, was different! *I* was different! My trials at Porcina's hands were like a distant memory, a forgotten childhood fear that vanished with the light. By the day of my date with Lauren, I had pictured everything from passionate lovemaking beneath the stars to tears of joy shed after the words “I do.” She was the *one*! My soul mate! My truly significant other!

She was

I woke up the following Monday with a smile on my face and butterflies in my chest. *Today was the day*! I showered and shaved with a song on my lips (which can actually be rather dangerous, and only via text message, explaining my seclusion as stemming from a desire to have abundant conversation at the ready. She, of course, agreed with my plan. I reached for my phone and let my thumbs fly, intent of describing what our future had in store.

“Good morning!” I wrote to her

“Morning!” came Lauren's reply. “Sure am!”

“How are Porcina and Aaron?” I asked.

“Ugh.” No further words were necessary.

“I can imagine, according to their description, were each draped with velvet curtains and illuminated by candlelight. A bit much, perhaps, but I wanted it to be memorable. This was our first date, after all, out of many more to come! I had even gone as far to ensure that several vegetarian options were available

“Love it!” she replied. “See you tonight!”

Class was dull, and culminating the evening with a kiss. I had decided, for once, to take things slow and steady, to keep from rushing towards the bedroom with my pants around my ankles. A later date might be different, but tonight... tonight would be pure. I moved from building to building, following my schedule out of habit alone. I checked my phone every chance that I got, but such thoughts evaporated each time I reread Lauren's messages.

“Sure am!”

“Love it!”

Even “Ugh.”

Nothing could stop me now!

Nothing

“Bad news, unable to believe what I was reading. She *was* canceling. This was terrible! I wondered if my enthusiasm had simply been too much, and it took no small amount of mental struggling to remind myself that Lauren hadn't been a party to it. Although, what if one of my friends had told her? What if I'd accidentally sent a message to her that had been meant for somebody else? I scanned through my outbox to be sure, trying to find the source of my folly.

I came up empty.

“Oh no

“Maybe

I've been trying to lose weight I gained for about a year and a half now, but I wanted to show that everyone is susceptible to fatlogic.

I was supposed to go to the gym but due to intense concentration on internet surfing

And then I thought about how it's the little decisions that add up.  So I decided right then that I was going to do one of my other workouts, woke up this morning with a good kind of sore.  Fuck yeah.  Trust me when I say that workout makes you sweat.  It's not just situps, it's your whole core.

But then after grazing a bit I was really hungry.  I had just come in at my lightest weight in a long time, reached in...


...and made myself some brussels sprouts and a protein shake.  Because it's the little decisions that add up.  To be fair


I think this is the most frustrating part of FPS.  It's people constantly saying over and over, that add up over time.  You have to be conscientious about it and it has to be *important* to you.  And that's why I find HAES, TP, and all of the other stuff so harmful.  It's the equivalent of meeting your friend after an AA meeting and saying, ""one drink wouldn't hurt"".  If that person is trying to get better, support them.  You're not a bad person if you're overweight; you're a bad person if you try to stop someone from improving themselves.

This story took place almost a year ago

&gt;Be 18 year old me

&gt;Just moved into freshman/sophomore dorm

&gt;Don’t be roommate

&gt;Also don’t be suite-mate KaiKai, so we luck out with only 3 people to a 4 person suite. *Or so we think.*

&gt;Three of us go to awkward move-in-day “getting to know everyone” dorm party. KaiKai is a sophomore so she already knows bunches of people. ESL and I are hoping she can introduce us and maybe be friends all around.

&gt;[MFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4cj6d98w11qgb5p1o1_500.gif) we walk in and there is a very large proportion of very large people. 

&gt;Don’t want to judge anyone right away; try to make nice with everyone. Some people seem really cool. Maybe this dorm thing will turn out to be fun.

&gt;Suddenly beverages start trembling in glasses

&gt;The room goes dark as a mysterious mass eclipses all light sources

&gt;In the distance

&gt;5’6

&gt;KaiKai

&gt;”This is my friend Hot-Cocoa Chanel

Note: What we didn’t yet know was that this means Cocoa was essentially going to be moving the fuck into the suite

&gt;First thing Cocoa says to me and ESL: “We’ll have to invite y’all over to the room for our movie and snack dates

&gt;THE FIRST FUCKING THING SHE SAID

&gt;THE. FIRST. THING.

&gt;Ignore derogatory comment. “Yeah that would be awesome; we’d love to hang with you guys.”

&gt;desperatetomakefriends.exe

&gt;”We’re having dinner together after this

&gt;By this point I am literally biting my lower lip in an attempt to not say anything (don't want to burn bridges with people who want to do sociable things with us) so ESL steps in and says ""Yes

&gt;""I'm studying *fashion design.*""

&gt;""I want to design fabulous clothing for curvy women instead of catering towards the unhealthy sizes you see in most stores."" 

&gt;Reaches out and starts pinching my shirt around the boob area

&gt;""You need to put on some weight so you can fill out this shirt with some cuuuuurves. Men don't like women who look like ten year old boys. I'm gonna have to feed you up at dinner""

&gt;""YEAH OKAY THANKS

&gt;Walk around

&gt;After awhile

&gt;Nowhere to be found. 

&gt;Ask around

&gt;Fast forward to later that night in the suite. KaiKai and Cocoa come rolling in while ESL and I are getting to know one another.

&gt;""Why you two leave to dinner without us?""

&gt;KaiKai looks uncomfortable. Cocoa looks legitimately offended that we questioned her.

&gt;""WELL YOU GUYS WERE ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROOM AND I FIGURED WHY WASTE TIME GOING TO GET YOU WHEN IF WE JUST LEFT WE'D BE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE DINING COMMONS.""

&gt;[OFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma1qqz0e6j1rosb88o1_250.gif)

&gt;""LOOK WE'LL DO IT SOME OTHER TIME. I DOUBT YOU TWO WOULD EAT ANYTHING ANYWAY.""

&gt;She then proceeds to walk away from us and start making a sandwich.

And that concludes the first evening of my college experience. It was just a small taste of the story-laden semester of hell that was to come. 

TL;DR: New college suitemate has hamplanet fashion-designing friend who poises herself to essentially move in. She brands my roommate and I with a scarlet ""A"" for ""anorexic, and then get defensive and justifies it by claiming we'd rather just starve.

**Chapter Seven**

“I was, “*incredibly* drunk last night when you got there. I was honestly afraid that I was going to throw up the whole time.”

Something didn't add up. “Porcina told me that you dropped her off at the restaurant

Lauren nodded. “Yeah, and tell her off when she got back.” She gave me a sheepish grin. “I guess it doesn't quite work like in the movies. I just felt sick.”

“First time being drunk?” I asked.

She shook her head. “No

I wanted to hear more – about anything she wanted to say

“Like I said

I furrowed my brow. “I'm not sure that I follow.”

Lauren sighed and rolled her eyes. “We got drunk together a little while ago, we used Porcina's camera, so she still had them. Last night, she wanted to post on Craigslist, and she told me she was going to use 'the pictures we took.'”

Everything seemed clear, and by that point, the damage was done. Porcina's excuse had apparently been “Nobody can see your face!” and Lauren – not wanting to ruin her roommate's chance at romance – had reluctantly agreed to play chauffeur.

Now, I resorted to my old, stupid sleaze, and simply stated, “Well... for the record, they *were* very nice.”

Back again was the blushing beauty

“So

Lauren looked up at me then... and smiled. “Sure, first on the floor and then stocking.”

“Sounds tiring, and no, I wasn't employed. Laugh it up, lard-butts.) “Here's my email address and phone number. Drop me a line when you can, and we'll set something up!”

“Thanks

I was happy. No, I was...

“*There you are*!”

… I was found. Goddamn it. I turned with a plastered-on smile to see Porcina standing on the outside of the aisle. Though she likely could have fit between the shelves

“I saw Lauren walking away from here

Goddamn it again! “Uh, like a man on his path to the electric chair, and braced myself for another rib-crushing hug. It came as expected, though it wasn't enough to stifle the tiny spot of warmth in my heart. *Lauren*, I silently thought, *nothing can keep me from you now*!

“So

I shrugged. “Not much.” Immediately after the words left my mouth, Porcina had pounced on the opportunity.

“*Really*?” she squealed. “That's *awesome*! We can hang out *all day*!” I tried to protest, and I was led from the shelves back towards the cafe. “Let's get something for the road,” she suggested. Naïve as I was, I thought she meant another drink. Instead, I bore witness to the slaughter of the cafe's food selection. Porcina helped herself to several ham sandwiches, another round of pound cake, a few mystery items wrapped in white wax paper, all of which – save for the mints – were handed to me to carry. Thankfully, she unceremoniously dumped the coins into the nearby tip jar

Personally

The day that followed was a disaster. Porcina led me from the bookstore and into the nearby mall, where she would loudly critique the merchandise. When an employee would inevitably approach, Porcina would treat them to a condescending explanation of why their stock was sub-par. We would leave shortly thereafter – with me offering silent apologies – to find a bench, upon which Porcina would plop herself and dig into her rapidly dwindling food supply (which I, for some reason, was still carrying). On those rare occasions when a store had items to her liking, Porcina would remove them from the shelves, and then dump them on the floor. (She did the same thing with the wrappers for her food

I know not how many hours I spent escorting this repugnant juggernaut, and given the same impression to every employee that we encountered: *We are the heralds of your misfortune*, our presence likely said, *a modern Marley and his chains, sent to foster pain upon thee for transgressions gone unnamed*! We left a wake of fear and frustration, and I felt I was partially responsible, if only by my presence beside the wrecking ball.

There was, a tiny noise escaped the purse kept perpetually pressed against Porcina's paunch. From within its confines, she withdrew a sleek cellphone, which I recognized as the (original) Motorola Razr. (It was all the rage back then, the must-have phone for anyone in the know.) Porcina answered with her mouth full, treating her caller to the same child-like voice I had come to dread.

“*Hellooooooo*?” she said. There was a pause, I'll *fucking be there*!” This went on for awhile, during which time I considered making an escape. As the call ended, Porcina turned to me with an apologetic look. “I'm *sooooooo soooooorry*,” she said, “but I have to *doooo something* tonight.”

“No worries

“This girl from my *class* is getting *married*

“Like I said, I might have noticed that all was not right with the world.

“Oh

Then she kissed me.

In all my days, slobbery mess of tongue and lips, each of which were coated with slimy globs of masticated food. Had I returned her affection, I have no doubt that I would have swallowed more than a few of the offending morsels and possibly died of utter disgust. (Also, a passing youth's cry of “Get a room!” did very little to preserve my good mood.)

We exited the mall shortly after, on the other hand, were quite ready to make a spirited retreat. I bid Porcina farewell – narrowly avoiding another kiss by turning my head into a strategically planned position – and hurried away, thoroughly relieved to be alive and free. I considered paying another visit to the bookstore, but decided not to risk overstaying my welcome. Instead, I returned home, feeling weary and drained... but excited. 

My day may not have gone *precisely* as I had planned, made plans (to make plans, I guess) for a date with Lauren, and arrived back at my apartment with a sense of satisfied pride. I had solved the mystery of Lauren's breasts (though I was looking forward to further investigation), offered my confession, and been absolved. Sure, there were some loose ends, at last

Oh

Before I start, and clothing are greater. In a place like New York, where walking is the main mode of transportation, and the culture of the city is geared to thinner, more athletic people, hamplanets have three choices:

2)hide away and eat themselves into a coma

3) spend ever fiber of their being and cent in the bank defending their lifestyle

I just finished another semester at University. I'm a recovering galaxy myself, my employer sends me the things, and I get them ready for auction. I was surprised when he offered me a position in the office (since I work primarily in the city, and he is in the countryside). This meant that I would spend the summer in a tiny mountain town. My lease was up, and my dog certainly would enjoy time in the mountains, so I decided to move. 


I just got everything inside my new place. mountaincabin.win. Scurrying around, all carrying housewarming gifts. We were exchanging our greetings when Hammila starting shuffling over. 

Hammila is short, as she was swaying back and forth. She had her daughter with her, who looks about 10, and thin. Poor thing probably just gets the scraps left over from her mothers feeding. We can hear her complaining through gasps that she ""was missin' guud tv for this"".

At this time, and give a bear hug with it. Unbrushed, rancid teeth smell, mixed with BO, I had to do my best to not vomit. letsburntheseclotheslater.yes. 

Hammila snaps at her daughter to give me their housewarming gifts. I can tell that there is some tension between the old ladies and Hammila. Hammila had given me a half bag [of these](http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj246/munzer90/IMG_1123.jpg) while explaining ""I had some in the car, and watched the drama unfold between Hammila and the old ladies. 

One of the old ladies (She had really long grey hair, with less mobility"".  Silver and the other ladies take it as their cue to leave. (They came over a few hours later for tea and to tell me the Hammila stories that have been collecting over the last 10 years) 

Hammila looks victorious as the others leave. Almost immediately, or snack while I'm your guest!"". I stood there shocked, and stammered out that my kitchen isn't put together yet, and apologize. I asked her to give me a minute to find a knife, and I'll cut the bread. I ran downstairs, grabbed my kitchenware, and returned. 

While I was gone Hammila decided to ""rip"" the bread so she could get those delicious calories faster.
""I didn't think you'd find a knife, while the rest was quickly being devoured. 
[MFW I noticed that she used the almost the entire jar of preserves on her ""slice""](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OMG-bird.gif). I offered her daughter a slice, she doesn't need it. She don't need all the sugar.""

I apologize

A few hours later, and guaranteed they will go as smoothly as this one.

I more or less maintained a massive weight without losing or gaining a pound for three years (I was 330 at my highest, and I started to battle through the self hatred to actually take care of myself. 

That was back in July, including tightening and toning. I have gone down two sizes and lost all fat on my legs, most on my arms, and at least two of my ten chins. My stomach is noticeably smaller, I have real shape forming on my body, my breasts are less heavy and today I had to make a new notch on my belt, after starting out with it being barely able to contain me on the first hole.

All in all

Now, but I don't think that is true. She is significantly bigger when actually standing side by side. Plus, she is just a large woman anyway...you know, those women who are just kinda 'thick', and when (if) she loses the weight, I am sure she is still going to be a giantess. Just in an Amazonian kind of way, not a jigglestep way. 

The other day I noticed that I judge the hell out of this chick. I mean, her diet, exercise level, what she claims she does every day, makes me rage way more than I would have just last Spring. 

It isn't because she is fat. Hell, we should encourage each other, she needs to drop some weight, and all that jazz. But she has never maintained any discipline, not for a single fucking day. Not for a single MEAL!

She eats nothing but fast food or heavy, extra large fries, triple patty burgers. When she does cook for herself, she uses a ton of oil, fries everything, consumes nothing healthy, and thinks because so many veggies are in it, olive oil

As for fitness? Bitch doesn't do anything. She talks about when she was living in Australia (US now), as she usually dumps the dog outside in the yard to fend for himself. 

I told her she should try breaking exercise into ten minute intervals several times a day, or anything else. 

Why am I raging about this all so hard now? Why do I give a fuck? Because earlier today, and that health is just as important to me as image. So, you know, rapid weight loss isn't what I am going for; consistent weight loss is.

Right after she says this? She casually mentions that nothing works for her

So I didn’t expect *that* much of an uproar over my actions last part, my wonderful beetusy sweetlings, now I give you what your hearts crave. Alpha Lucist and Justice.

The main plot of this part takes place a few months after the events of that night

I know you’re curious about the repercussions of that night, stupid beta Lucist! You’ll be happy to know it was *me* that initiated the conversation with her and forced myself down in the chair next to her. Thank you CB for the Alpha advice.

&gt;didn’t apologize; didn’t talk about that night

&gt;just made sure she and I could talk again

&gt;felt good because I’ve never looked this in shape in my life

&gt;remembered pacing in front of my mirror talking myself up in the morning

&gt;thought that would bring up some bad memories so I play it off like a champ

&gt;walk her to her door

&gt;she invites me in one day after our class because we were just having a discussion on who was better at Street Fighter and she wanted to take me on

Yup, quick ones with friends when they came over. I’d like to point out that the old me would have politely declined because he’d call this situation “enough work for the day” and head home happily. I manned the fuck up and accepted my beautiful planets.

&gt;walk up to KG

&gt;”My grandfather actually used to own a farm in India.”

&gt;he did. Although I’ve never met him

&gt;”You know what he kept on his farm?”

&gt;”Do you know what India’s sacred animal is? It’s the cow.”

&gt;”You know

&gt;neverbeenthere.ini

&gt;”I wouldn’t want to hurt a revered animal such as you though; we usually milk the cow when she’s more *relaxed*. I’ll try to not disturb you when I spend the night with Scarlett”

2 things. First, I couldn’t believe at the time how much of a ballsack I had for saying I’d be spending the night with Scarlett… in her bed.

 I’d actually like your rating on how much justice was served here. I remember this day vividly even 3 years later and I still feel I sort of cheesed out in my dishing of Justice to KG. It just seems kind of… dorky at this point.

&gt;KG on a fat rampage

&gt;threatens to call the cops on me for sexually harassing her and insulting her

&gt;yells at me to get out of her room

&gt;proceed to tell her to shut the actual fuck up or I’ll go to the cops telling them that she violated me

&gt;Scarlett attests to that

&gt;honestly don’t think she was but

&gt;she stares at us blankly with this stupid glazy look and turns around and rolls out yelling madly

&gt;you’d think I actually did get to her

&gt;a few second later we hear the fridge open and close around 8 or 9 times and a lot of pots and pans and all around kitchen noise fill up the house

&gt;she was eating it away

&gt;cow’s gotta eat

&gt;proceed to make out with Scarlett for the rest of the day

How are your freakish

I realize most of you looking for juicy justice right now are not too happy. I’m not going to lie, KG was here to stay. She couldn’t be moved because of her condishun.

*BONUS*

KG ate all the food in the fridge (3 packs of lunchables, her frozen foods like pizzas, fries, chicken patties, and a 2 liter of diet *tee^hee* soda, half a gallon of milk and various other foods that FitGirl usually keeps *healthy included*) according to FitGirl and Scarlett’s analysis of the tornado that hit their kitchen. KG had apparently gone to stay with SH for the night. Good riddance I say. Now for the best bit:

&gt;wake up next morning in a familiar floral patterned bed

&gt;try not to look across from me at poor Liam’s face

&gt;Scarlett’s sleeping next to me

&gt;holyshitIdidit.mp4

&gt;ohshit

&gt;walk out quietly 

&gt;see the mirror on Scarlett’s door

&gt;damn

&gt;close the door softly

&gt;look across the hall at FitGirl’s open door

&gt;see CB staring at me like I just won a medal

&gt;shit eating grin. head to bathroom

&gt;hey

&gt;best piss ever

End of Part 4.

Let’s call this the end of Beta Lucist honestly. But yeah, heading back home for religious reasons.

Community vote for next story! 

1.	Would you rather read about how we came up with the name we gave KG? 
2.	Would you rather read about the day we met D.J. Hammer?


*EDIT*
Yeah, is an amazing place. Not just because of the amazing stories, but the motivation it brings to you through each one. 

So, a walk then. Just get moving. Meet people. Find your Scarlett.

Hold on to your motivation. It's the only thing that'll drive you. My motivation was Scarlett and in the end I achieved my dream. 

If you have a CB in your life. Hold on to them too. CB has been one of the best influences in my life. For someone who's life is amazing

Good Luck my friends! :D

This one happened a couple of days ago, ravishing lovelies going hungry a second longer. So here I am, relaying what is one of the most horrifying examples of childhood food addiction I have ever seen. 

I was at the pool with my kids, all things considered. There were a couple of girls in their 20's tanning, a middle-aged guy who always sits on the side turning more orange by the day, and a couple of mothers with their kids, not including me and my two children. 

One of the mother's is a frequent pool visitor. She is always dressed to the nines, since ""swimming takes up so much energy"". 

Both children are slightly older than my oldest, as they told my daughters when they went to go play in the deep end and the brothers couldn't go with them. 

Anyway, as though his brother has taken his spleen. His fat folds are flapping in protest as he waddles in pursuit of that extra crunchy goodness. 

Now, including a two year old who wriggled out of his mother's grasp and jumped naked into the deep end, almost drowning. I am paranoid. 

I start inching towards these kids

The kid holding them suddenly pretends to throw the Cheetos into the pool. Without seeing if they really were thrown (they weren't

I swim the few remaining feet and scoop him up as quickly as possible, and his mother STILL HAS NOT GOTTEN UP FROM THE CHAIR! Despite both of her sons freaking out, and more than one person noticing from the sidelines what is going on.

The brother runs over to tell her what happened, ""YOUR DAMN KID ALMOST DROWNED! GET YOUR ASS UP AND OVER HERE!""

This got her attention. She comes running over

They had to close the pool for the rest of the afternoon. I don't know who I am more mad at, or the kid who was willing to die for soggy Cheetos. ",,False,self,t5_2vzax,False,,

&gt;Be me

&gt;16 years old,78 m tall

&gt;Still live at home

&gt;Grocery store is just around the corner from where we live

&gt;Go there

&gt;Suddenly

&gt;The water in the bottles next to me is shaking uncontrollably

&gt;The chicken in the fridge section is coming back to life and starts to run

&gt;An  old man enters  the store

&gt;He’s about as tall as me

&gt;Estimate about 50 kg

&gt;Is so weak he literally DRAGS the shopping cart instead of pushing it

&gt;wat.jpg

&gt;I realize that he can’t be the one causing those earthquakes

&gt;Then I see it

&gt;IT looks like a greasy stranded whale 

&gt;IT is about 60 years old

&gt;IT wears an old knitwear from about 30 years ago

&gt;Judging by the stench of rot she emits

&gt;She yells at the old man in front of her: “HUGOOOO


Now, TV’s and cellphones. Of course, since it’s a branch in a small town, they only get like a handful of those devices to sell. SO obviously, most of those are gone as soon as the store opens in the morning, because people practically camp in front of the doors at 7 am to get those cheap things. Apparently, the old couple wanted to get the special offer for this day
were no devices left to buy. Bare in mind that it’s late afternoon at the point of this story.


&gt;He doesn’t say a thing and just keeps dragging his shopping cart like a gravedigger drags his shovel

&gt;He has this soulless look in his eyes

&gt;”Whatever”

&gt;I go and take the bread

&gt;There’s a heavily pregnant woman standing in front of me

&gt;I’m waiting in the checkout line when suddenly

&gt;I hear a grunt from behind and the pushing continues 

&gt;I turn around and guess what: It’s Lady Hambeast again

&gt;She has taken over control of the empty cart and is pushing it into me

&gt;I say “Excuse me

&gt;LHB: “WHYT AHM DOIN??? PERHBS U SHUD GO AUT OF THA WAY??? MAYBE RESBECT YOUR ELDERS A BIT MOAR!!”

&gt;I am stunned by this rudeness and too beta to say something

&gt;Hugo is standing behind her and stares holes in the air

&gt;LHB moves on and sees the pregnant woman

&gt;RAMS THE FUCKING CART IN TO HER SO SHE ALMOST FELL OVER

&gt;Yells: “ GET OUTTA MAH WAY YOU STOOPID LARDASS!!”

&gt;watwatwatwatwatwat.gif.jpg.png.exe

&gt;didshejust…?

&gt;Pregnant woman is now red from anger

&gt;Starts yelling back: “ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE? I’M PREGNANT! YOU COULD’VE KILLED MY BABY!”

&gt;LHB: “NAH U AIN’T PREGGO U JUSS FAT AN LAZEH AH CAN SEE IT!”

&gt;bitchuserious.gif

&gt;Woman is now in rantmode

&gt;Yells at her for at least 5 minutes straight

&gt;All the time the cashier has a look of horror and disgust on her face

&gt;When Preggo woman is done

&gt;She waddles away to the entrance

&gt;She doesn’t seem to know that you can only leave the building through the exit behind the checkout
the inside

&gt;She stands in front of the door for a minute

&gt;Finally

&gt;He enters the store and she throws the empty cart in the general direction of the man 

&gt;He turns around

&gt;Then he realises us staring and has a questionmark.jpg look on his face

&gt;timetogetoutofhere.avi

&gt;I pay for the bread and give my change to the pregnant woman ‘cus she deserved it (about 9€)

&gt;The cashier tells me that this woman was already banned from TWO grocery stores she worked at before

&gt;MFW the next time I go to that store there’s a picture of LHB’s face next do the sign that says “Dogs are not allowed in here.”

So this takes place a few days after part 2 ends. Also

&gt;Walk into school and friend immediately grabs me and pulls me aside

&gt;""You won't believe what's being said about you"" she whispers

&gt;Turns out hammie was telling people that my boyfriend and I ""sexual harrased"" her. I shit you not she was telling people that I made her watch why I jacked my boyfriend off.

&gt;All of my rage

&gt;Hunt her down until I find her

&gt;Hold nothing back and start screaming how she a psychotic

&gt;It doesn't take long for the principal to show up with the school police officer

&gt;Principal takes her to his office

&gt;He sits me down in his office and leaves to (I assume) ask the principal what to do

&gt;Comes back a few minutes later with a paper and pen and askes me to write down everything that happened

&gt;When I finish he takes me into the waiting area outside his office and leaves

&gt;Comes back with my boyfriend and asks him to do the same thing

&gt;Then asks my boyfriend and I to follow him

&gt;Takes us to conference room where Hammie and principal are waiting

&gt;Tells us to sit at the opposite end of the table

&gt;When they ask Sara to tell her side of the story this time she says that I made her touch my boyfriends dick

&gt;""Well... uh... I... don't know."" she says

&gt;""You don't know?"" he asks

&gt;Suddenly she bursts into tears and starts wailing

&gt;Between sobs she admits to making it all up

&gt;Feel bad for her for a split second

&gt;Then I remember the whole school now thinks my boyfriend and I are sexual attacking people

&gt;Doesn't feel bad anymore

I will admit, she did show up in my suggested facebook friends a few months ago which was strange considering this all happened four years ago). My boyfriend and I are still happily together but tend to avoid this memory as it does bring a odd mix of emotions in me, but I felt this story fits well here.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Fuck.

This was almost worse than a cancellation. It was worse than *Armageddon*. Stuck in a romantic booth with Porcina? Dante's visions of Hell were tame by comparison. Even if it *was* a double date, smacking her lips, grabbing at my legs and flashing the wait staff, all in an effort to play that so-called “jealousy card” that Lauren had previously mentioned... and *Lauren*, poor Lauren, would be assigned the role of reigning in her roommate, of keeping at bay the hogs of war.

“Do you want to reschedule?” I asked. “Maybe for tomorrow night?”

My response came not in the form of a text message

“Hi

“I'm sure you're not to blame

Lauren sighed audibly. “I can't. I took extra work shifts after school this week so I could be free for tonight. After that

""I thought you worked weekends?"" I asked

""Finals again. There's a lot of empty time slots."" My same old streak of paranoia reared its ugly head. Surely Lauren could *make* the time to see me, and had enlisted Porcina's help?

It didn't matter. I didn't care. I decided then to make the best of the evening. “I guess it will have to be a double date. How did this happen

Another sigh preceded Lauren's words. “Aaron is a year behind us. He's up here touring colleges. He's staying until Wednesday, I darkly thought to myself. “Porcina wanted the three of us to go out. I told her I was busy. She wouldn't drop it, so I finally told her I was busy with *you*.”

“That can't have been good

“It wasn't so bad. She was actually excited. She said something about me always going for the people she rejected.”

“Uh

“Ew.”

“Sorry.”

“No

Still, I should keep from making such crass comments. “So,” I continued, “she just invited herself along?”

“Pretty much, had managed to create. Were I in Lauren's place, I wouldn't want to leave her unattended, either. “I offered to drop her off somewhere beforehand, but she wouldn't hear it. I'm sorry.”

“What would happen

“No, not you again. What did you say?”

“I asked what would happen if you just left without her.”

*That* got a chuckle, but I know better. Honestly, it's just easier to give her what she wants. It's only until the end of the year.”

Only until the end of the year? “You're moving out?”

“Uh-huh. I love her

A piece of good news amidst all the sorrow! “Well,” I said. I checked the time on my pocket watch. (Shut up. I was twenty, and a recovering peacock. Besides, I *like* pocket watches. Seriously, shut up.) “You know... *I* have a car. Does Porcina have her license? Could she borrow yours for the evening?”

“Nope.”

I held my tongue for a moment

“Nope.”

It was my turn to sigh. “Well

In hindsight, my back seat was quickly populated, first by the petite girl who was the subject of my affections, and then by a man who looked like a two-thirds scale model of a normal adult male. Everything about him was small, save for his oversized graphic t-shirt. I couldn't help but notice that the cartoon character emblazoned upon it – no doubt some hero of Japanese origin – was strikingly similar in stature to Aaron. A few wisps of elongated peach fuzz clung to the young man's chin, and I immediately noticed his nervous habit of tugging on each of them in sequence.

Then

“*Hiiiiiii*!” she squealed

“My Porsche is in the shop

“*Whatever*

Her constant comments about my wallet were starting to get to me. Worst of all, leaving me to find external funding for any luxuries, like romantic getaways. Porcina's insistence in reminding me of this fact was something less than welcome, especially considering the financial hardship I would be be enduring for this disaster of a first date. (Not to mention the extra gas exhausted in hauling around her weight.) I had no problem losing funds for a date with Lauren on her own, but after only thirty seconds in Porcina's presence, I was wishing for hazard pay.

That sentiment was helped along by the young woman's choice in attire. She had squeezed into a purple dress with no sleeves to speak of

Well

“So where are we *goooooooing*?” Porcina whined. “It better be *gooooood*.”

I told her the name of the restaurant

“Afghani

“Indian

“Afghani

“So

Before I could respond, I would have preferred her trademark hiss.

“Thanks, covered by a feminine blazer. She looked, for lack of a better word, attractive. ""*Really* nice,"" I soundlessly finished.

Porcina let out a gasp of mock incredulity. “Are you guys telling *secrets*? Come on

“No secrets

“No secrets

“Come *ooooon*” Porcina whined again

I checked the time on my dashboard. Less than two minutes had passed.

This was going to be a long night.

I know it's long

&gt;be me

&gt;helping the husband BBQ the last of the meat

&gt;datsmell.itsmellsgood

&gt;most of neighborhood and close family has arrived

&gt;everyone lounging around the pool, neighbors laughing

&gt;freakingorgeousday.mpeg

&gt;everyone getting ready to eat

&gt;start setting everything that has been brought out

&gt;been a relaxing hour and a half

&gt;get everyone in line

&gt;start feeling gravitational pull

&gt;look behind me off the deck and OK and her parents have arrived

&gt;OK is in the shower curtain material bathing suit and shirt from last night

&gt;notice it's men's swimming trunks

&gt;""HAAAAY LeadFootSpiderMonkey! The party has arrived! TEEHEE..UEUEUEUEUE""

&gt;greet OK and parents

&gt;they all look high and smell like patchouli

&gt;whydopotheadsalwayssmellikepatchouli.png

&gt;come up with new names for parents

&gt;don't think anything of it

&gt;everyone in line

&gt;OK waddles over to the food

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/wxQtL.gif) she laughs and wobbles her way in between my mom and nephew to get a plate and cut line

&gt;PM and PD look like they don't give a fuck

&gt;then i realize PM hasn't seen her cutting line yet (we have a big family and a full neighborhood
about 17-18 people in line)

&gt;PM see's her and puts her head down and averts her eyes

&gt;i offer her a fishbowl margarita so this woman can relax even more

&gt;she and PD both accept

&gt;imakedatmargaritagood.avi

&gt;I walk out with one of the margaritas and nearly drop it when i see the reaction my nephew has when he 
finally turns around and sees Kirby in human form in front of him

&gt; [hfw] (http://imgur.com/BcEvR)

&gt;I sit the margarita down on the picnic table just off the side of the deck and throw 2 straws in so they can 
begin drinking

&gt;BFF tells me to look at OK's plate

&gt;she took a rack of ribs and half the potato salad already

&gt;she fumbles around and pulls a 2nd plate out from under what I thought was one

&gt;fills it with one of everything from desert table

&gt;notice that she brought her own Bubba Mug (big mug with a spout on it used for small contrustion jobs)

&gt;she wobbles over to the picnic table and plops her food down

&gt;oh damn

&gt;she tries to put her legs in

&gt;offer her biggest

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/u6Hnv.gif) she misses the chair because she can't see behind her

&gt;KIRBY USES ROLL

&gt;it is effective

&gt;she is rolling like a ball on her sides

&gt;then a hole is ripped in time and space

&gt;Kirby lets out a huge ripping

&gt;sounds like a duck caught in an industrial fan

&gt;think the suction caused a major wedgie

&gt;Kirby surprisingly laughs it off

&gt;proceeds to eat everything on both plates while chattering to the neighbors around us with her mouth full of 
food

&gt;she is high as a muthafucka.pdf


This is where BFF and I start feeling AWFUL for PM and PD

&gt;Everyone has eaten and is now surrounding my neighbor's pool

&gt;got that slip n slide out for the kiddos in our yard

&gt;OK has polished off 3rd plate of food

&gt;OK brings chair over to where everyone is sitting between both yards

&gt;plops chair down and announces that she is going to use the slip n' slide so she can talk to the cute army guy 
helping the kids out

&gt;that's my brother who is dating one of my sisters friends

&gt;she proceeds to grab her shirt and starts to take it off

&gt;NOOOOOOOOOOOO.imoutofideasforfilenamessofuckit.gif

&gt;I thought she was wearing a tank top under her shirt

&gt;it is one of those half tank bikini tops that ties in the back and around your neck

&gt;where is the acid

&gt;she has like 5 rolls on each arm

&gt;about a fuck million on her body

&gt;bitch is trying to seductively walk over to the slip n slide

&gt;looks about how you would think Kirby in real life would look trying to be seductive

&gt;she rolls over to my brother and loudly exclaims ""WOW! look at those muscles!! do you work out??""

&gt;reaches over as my brother looks in horror at her trying to ...pet??..... his arms

&gt;he is ahead of the game and says ""yeah

&gt;""girlfriend"" term is ineffective

&gt;PM in her high and tipsy stupor says ""18 years old and never had a boyfriend""

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/gQFN3.gif) she's only 18?!?!

&gt;she looks like she's 25-30

&gt;PM continues

&gt;everyone is silent

&gt;says OK doesn't see the problem and is proud of her

&gt;wait for it....

&gt;her ""curves""

&gt;bitch you don't have curves

&gt;says Kirby is starting college in August and has been home schooled the past 2 years for getting in fights that 
OK would start

&gt;tells us OK almost got expelled for almost hitting a cafeteria lady because she wouldn't give her extra food

&gt;everyone is looking at PM in horror

&gt;I get up to go get that woman another drink

&gt;hear brother say ""WATCH OUT!!!"" really loudly to my niece

&gt;Kirby has engaged speed waddle

&gt;puts her arms out and FLOPS onto the slip n slide

&gt;Kirby goes about 3 feet and stops

&gt;her top has folded under her behemo-boobs

&gt;she is giggling and asks army brother for help

&gt; ""army broooooo, teehee""

&gt;she winks and wiggles her top up just in time for super fit brother to pull her up to sitting position

&gt;has to call over same 2 guys to help her up like they all did before

&gt;go in to make the margarita
back

&gt;look over and slip n slide has 1 foot rip in it


&gt;shamu is about to return to the water y'all

&gt;Kirby wants to do a cannon ball

&gt;helpusall.treefort

&gt;she is still doing that ""seductive"" walk
neighbors house

&gt;starts singing at the top of her lungs

&gt;giggles and cannon balls into the pool

&gt;good thing this pool has stairs that are built into cement

&gt;army brothers girlfriend shows up after work shift

&gt;he runs to her and kisses her

&gt;Kirby snarls

&gt;""I'm Oversized Kirby! And who are YOU?""

&gt;PD starts to get up and say that they are heading home

&gt;PM tells him to sit down and drink

&gt;GO PM! Don't let her ruin your good time

&gt;bro girlfriend introduces herself


At this point I witnessed fat logic 101 and never thought I'd her this come out of a fat persons mouth

&gt;""You gonna eat??"" Kirby says in a sassy tone

&gt;bro girlfriend is fit and takes care of herself

&gt;""No

&gt;Then Kirby says it....

&gt;""Guess you're too scared to have curves like me

&gt;Bro Girlfriend just looks around kinda stunned as Kirby does a little ""seductive twist"" and walks away

&gt;everyone is silent


&gt;PM and PD get up and say goodbye politely

&gt;me and BFF immediately invite PM to our movie tomorrow night

&gt;feelsorryforherman.jpg

&gt;she says she will call and let me know

&gt;tells OK they are leaving

&gt;OK turns and grabs Army Bro in a hug and ""teeehee's"" a few times

&gt;i think he's gonna suffocate in her fat

&gt;She grabs her Bubba Jug and follows PM and PD down the road talking loudly about how Army Bro was totally 
into her

&gt; [mfw] (http://i.imgur.com/HWiWs.gif) I still don't know why they have a snow cone truck and forgot to ask


TL;DR- New neighbor who looks like Kirby in human form, lets out duck sounding fart, eats a ton of food, flirts with bro, breaks the slip n slide, thin shames Army Brothers girlfriend, tries to be seductive, parents say they have tried helping but ""muhcurves""
 
Me and BFF have to finish cleaning up now. Will post more as they happen

Jeff held up a palm at me. “Nuh-uh. Drink first, then cut through the cardboard case of beer with two swift strokes. I didn't ask how he'd acquired the beverages – I was the eldest in my group of friends, and still a few months shy of legal drinking age – and although I wasn't usually taken with excessive consumption of alcohol, I was happy to accept a treatment for my short-circuited nerves. I slumped onto my tiny couch, while Jeff took up residence on the matching armchair. There was a familiar popping sound as he uncapped two bottles, one of which was handed to me. I gave Jeff a sardonic salute – something of a tradition between us – and downed the bitter suds like a man dying of thirst. 

“I'm dead

“Naw

“No,” I insisted. “Porcina is going to accuse me of rape or something. Lauren will never speak to me again. I'll spend my life behind bars because of some crazy girl's wild fantasy.”

Jeff made a noise like “Pfft

“Well, but seriously... this isn't going to end well. I should have just slept with her.”

My words prompted a quizzical look for Jeff. “How would that have helped?” he asked.

“Because...” I started to say, and I continued. “Porcina is *crazy*. Like, actually crazy. She might really *believe* that something happened between us... but if that's true, then Lauren probably knows about it.”

“Probably.”

“Then again

“Naw

I wearily shrugged my shoulders. “Maybe. I don't know. This whole thing is such a mess.”

For a brief moment,” he finally said, “do you think *maybe* this is... *partially* your fault?” I gave him a look of doubt. “I'm just saying,” he went on, “that you make stupid decisions sometimes. I mean, you're really smart... but you can also be an idiot.”

“How could I have avoided this one?” I asked.

Jeff held up a finger. “You could have stayed off Craigslist.” Another digit joined the first. “You could have left the restaurant at *any* time.” A third finger rose to meet the others. “You could have cut off contact and not chased after Lauren.” Jeff gave up on counting

“Porcina

“You could have told *Porcina* you weren't interested before you followed her around the mall. You could have mailed her a check, give the money to *Lauren*, which would have been an excuse to see her.”

Jeff, I considered my intellect to be my pride and my best asset, but in the face of my friend's observations, I looked like an utter fool. “You're right,” I muttered, feeling unhappy. “And now, I'm going to end up in jail.”

“You're not going to go to *jail*...” Jeff answered. “Come on

I felt my face break into a smile. The combination of ethanol

“Thanks

Jeff shrugged. “So

The picture was all too fresh in my mind, this time. He made a disgusted noise when I described Porcina's rise from beneath the bedclothes, and pantomimed a gag when I spoke about her tantrum. I hesitated only when my tale reached the point of my exit from Porcina's room, when I bumped into Lauren and saw her all but naked (and in person, this time). Remembering the event with anything approaching arousal seemed like a gross discourtesy... but I finally confessed to having thoroughly enjoyed the sight.

“Then, “and I guess I must have called you.”

“Yup.” Jeff opened another pair of bottles

My stomach did a tiny flip. “I don't think I can stomach anything with cheese

“Then order a salad. *I* want pizza.” He reached into his pocket, which sat behind an open door at the room's far corner. Jeff departed for only a minute, but when he returned, there was a cryptic look on his face. “Uh... well, huh.”

“What is it?” I asked. In response, it was paired with a few characters of text: 1 MSG

One message.

One message from *who*?

I flipped open my phone and commanded my shaking fingers to cooperate. A brief

“Sorry about Porcina. She's done this before. Sleeping now. Talk tomorrow after class.”

It was signed

1372634921.0,1he4iw,Christmas with my hamplanet sister.,CanadianJesus,461,85,78,"[Introduction to my hamplanet sister BS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1hb6jf/more_sad_than_funny_my_hamplanet_sister_is_eating/)

This story takes place during Christmas last year

BS and her chubby hubby CM are at least $50000 in debt with nothing of value to show for. They have basically spent all money on food and cigarettes. They can no longer afford to pay their bills and are dependant on my parents financially.

As Christmas was approaching I hadn't seen my family for several months as I was studying abroad in Germany. I flew back to Sweden a few days before Christmas to stay at my parents house in my home town. BS and her family live in an even smaller town

Traditional Swedish Christmas food is referred to as [Julbord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord#Julbord) in Sweden. It's basically lot's of different dishes, my mother and other sister OS prepare most of the dishes at my parents house the day or days before and bring them. This year I was helping too, since I was at the time a vegetarian as of eight months and made vegetarian versions of my favourite dishes. BS and CM were pretty much only in charge of potatoes and beverages. Since my parents didn't want to ruin Christmas, they had even wired some money to pay for this.

As we arrive on Christmas eve morning (that's when we celebrate Christmas in Sweden) I notice that BS has lost a considerable amount of weight. The last time I saw her, if not more. Maybe there is hope for her yet?

I complimented her on her weight loss and told her she looked great. I thought that they had cut down on the takeaway, weighing at least 150 kg. Apparently they can still afford his Coca-Cola. 

We start unpacking and preparing the food we brought and just making chit chat. BS now tells us that they had decided to have an alcohol free Christmas this year because she ""don't want drunk people around the kids"". I don't buy this excuse since no one has ever been drunk on Christmas before. We grown-ups drink a Christmas beer (a dark lager or ale) and one or two shots of akvavit or similar strong spirits. The most outrageous thing that has happened would be my father falling asleep on the couch after lunch

I suspect that the money my parents wired might not have gone to the food and drink it was supposed to but I don't say anything because I don't want to ruin Christmas. Now don't get me wrong

As we finishing up the food preparations and setting up the table I start to understand where at least some of the money went. BS brings out not one, a swedish christmas soft drink. She also brings out a bottle of Coca-Cola for CM. Now this might not seem like a lot, but keep in mind that there are only eight of us there, two being young children. I look BS in the eye and say something like: ""Wow, six bottles?""

 She answers me dead serious: ""Well

I sneak down to the basement a few minutes later and discover 4 six-packs of the same 1, at least I won't go thirsty.

When we sit down to eat

interjects: ""CanadianJesus is a vegetarian

Me: ""Well

Niece:""Why not?""

Now

Me: ""Well

I should say that at this time I weighed roughly 78 kg on my 1

BS: ""That's just not true. Meat is healthy. We eat meat and we are healthy.""

Me: ""I'm not saying you can't be healthy whilst eating meat

This is when CM gets involved

CM: ""Calories don't matter when it comes to meat. The only thing that matters is calories from carbs. You can eat as much meat as you want and not gain weight.""

I usually avoid disagreeing with CM

Me: ""Well

BS: ""Whatever. You don't need to be skinny to be healthy. You can be just as healthy whatever your weight is.""

Me: ""Well

CM: ""That doesn't mean anything. Correlation doesn't imply causality. The same genes that cause obesity cause those diseases as well.""

At this point I realise how I can't outlogic these hamplanets and let the matter drop. We finish lunch and move to the sitting room. I think Santa is about to visit soon. 

Now, since Christmas is for the young kids anyway.

I put on the Santa suit and sneak through the basement where I pick up the big sack of presents. I would have assumed that it would be light this year because of the economic situation but it was as heavy as always. I knock on the door and my niece, since I know that OS and I only bought one present each for the kids and my parents only a few.

After I was done pretending to be Santa I sneak back in through the basement and go back up to the sitting room. My niece informs me that I just missed Santa but he left me a present on the coffee table. As the kids are too busy playing with their new toys my mother discreetly asks my sister about the presents

BS: ""Oh

My mother: ""That money wasn't just for Christmas you know. You don't get paid until the end of January. How much do you have left until then?""

BS: ""Oh

The look on my mothers face when she realises she's expecting her to  bail them out again.

My mother: ""Well

BS spent the rest of the evening sulking and shooting daggers at my mother.

TL;DR: My mum wires money to my sister. She spends it on sugary drinks and presents for the kids. Mum finally let's her know that she isn't bailing them out any more.

EDIT: [Part Two Available Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e25zc/hamburglar_ruins_dinner_for_everyone/)


&gt;Be 14

&gt;Our choir class is heading to Banff

&gt;16 hour drive via greyhound

&gt;Seated next to a bucktoothed walrus

&gt;5'3''

&gt;Hamburglar is sorta my friend but only because nobody else really likes her

&gt;Sits down next to me

&gt;Smells like a month old moldy pizza roll is stuck under one of her many waves of fat

&gt;Breathing out of mouth mode engaged

&gt;Takes out party sized bag of chips and munches on them

&gt;Whatever.jpg

&gt;I have backpack absolutely full of treats

&gt;Supposed to last me and my friends the entire 2 week trip in Banff

&gt;Hour 3: Hamburglar has run out of family sized bag of munchies and has totaled her entire tray of cookies. I take out some licorice my mum packed for me

&gt;""HEY SYCAMORI CAN I HAVE SOME"" ""Uhm... sure I guess""

&gt;She takes entire bag of licorice

&gt;Whatever I wouldn't have eaten that much licorice anyways

&gt;Hour 6: I open bag and grab the fruit salad I put on top of all my sweets

&gt;I swear she's getting turned on just by looking at it

&gt;Quickly zip bag back up

&gt;Hour 7: Begins talking to me about her ""relationship"" with a guy at school

&gt;Actual Quote: Yeah... Wailord is sooo protective of me

&gt;In reality Wailord avoids her at all costs

&gt;Killme.png

&gt;Pitstop: We all get off the bus to get food

&gt;""OH SYCAMORI LET'S GO TO MCDONALDS IM SOO HUNGRY PLEEEEASE LET'S GO THERE I HATE TIM HORTONS :("" 

&gt;Proceeds to drag me by my arm over to McDonalds

&gt;Cannot fight the gravitational pull of Hamburglar

&gt;She orders 4 Fish Fillets

&gt;I order a cranberry muffin because I'm a vegetarian and cannot eat anything at McDicks

&gt;Her mum phones her and seemingly asks her what she's eaten on the trip so far

&gt;Back on bus

&gt;The strenuous act of wolfing down 4 fish fillets in record time must've caused cooking oil to begin coming out of her pores

&gt;Hour 10

&gt;Tell her I'll be at the back of the bus with one of my friends

&gt;Sit at the back with him

&gt;Hour 16

&gt;Go to grab my backpack of goodies

&gt;Unzip

&gt;LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS GONE

&gt;""Oh

&gt;Pissed beyond belief

**tl;dr: Twilight loving walrus that smells like death eats the junk food that's supposed to last 10 people 2 weeks

The horror doesn't end there, so give me some feedback if you want to.

[PART ONE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1issx3/just_wait_ten_minutes_please_a_story_of_betrayal/)

Part Two will be the finale, early 30s, I have learned to curb my abrasiveness and am generally a pleasant person to be around, though I'm still very cynical and not afraid to speak my mind.  At the age of this story, I was a pretty terrible person.  However, even I could not fathom how far I would go to end the pain of this night.  You will learn soon.

I expect mixed reactions on the ending of this

Anyways

&gt;be me and walking whale

&gt;me looking sexy as hell

&gt;crimson silk fucking rules

&gt;my date looks like a train wreck covered in sugar

&gt;can't wait to see the looks we get

&gt;well...SHE gets.

&gt;hostess is sexy as hell

&gt;must work out

&gt;smiles at me brightly

&gt;[hfw](http://i.imgur.com/zqMEj05.gif) she realizes she-beast and me are here together

&gt;her eyes look to me

&gt;they say how sorry she is

&gt;I must not be hiding my unhappiness with this situation well

&gt;I wish I could just yell [this](http://i.imgur.com/LDMByVd.gif)

&gt;hostess seats us

&gt;well...""seat"" is a relative term

&gt;restaurant is fucking packed

&gt;looks like only one or two spots open

&gt;only booths

&gt;praying there is enough room

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;bellowing is building up

&gt;tub-of-fun uses ultra bitch mode!  It's super effective!

&gt;""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO FIT IN THERE?  DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME

&gt;[mfw](http://t.qkme.me/3oows6.jpg) she bellows that out of her gullet

&gt;I had no clue people like this existed

&gt;sexy hostess looks ready to cry

&gt;give most sympathetic look to her

&gt;unspoken exchange helps both of us

&gt;people on either side of empty booth are cowering in fear

&gt;I would be too

&gt;two wild waitresses appear!

&gt;immediately regret their decision

The next five minutes was spent negotiating with either side of our booth to get out long enough to adjust the width of the booths and tables.  Thankfully, so it did work out for shebeast, who seemed content for that moment.

&gt;sit down in booth

&gt;immediately grab beverage menu

&gt;wonders if jack daniels can just be served by the bottle

&gt;ponders 12 step program for just a moment

&gt;brain brings me back to reality

&gt;cringe as booth across from me creaks in pain when tub-of-fun sits/drops/thuds into it.

&gt;at least she isn't bellowing

&gt;cautious optimism that worst is over

&gt;LOLNO

&gt;STUPID GNPUNK

&gt;""Oh my god I don't know what to get!  There are so many things I love here!""

&gt;realization hits me that she might expect me to pay for everything

&gt;trying to remember if I said otherwise

&gt;don't think it was discussed

&gt;waiter comes to take beverage order

&gt;contemplate ordering everything on the top shelf in one giant glass

&gt;settled for jack and coke

&gt;wind builds up

&gt;flowers at table never stood a chance

&gt;Probably wondering if his tip is going to suck

&gt;Realizes I'm also in pain.

&gt;She beast orders three appetizers without even asking me.

&gt;Goodbye credit card.  Was nice knowing you.


I didn't even bother to make small talk because she started ripping on every single skinny person around us

&gt;breadsticks are here!

&gt;I love breadsticks!

&gt;I want to cry

&gt;""What can I get for your entree tonight?""

&gt;Oh

&gt;I like salad.

&gt;Especially with caesar dressing.  Fucking delicious.

&gt;.....four?

&gt;did you just order four fucking entrees?

&gt;hamplanet

&gt;waiter nods

&gt;take me with you

&gt;take me to the hot hostess please

My brain was trying to figure out what to do at this point.  She had just ordered $100 in food and was already halfway through a margarita because LOLDRINKINGISBADEXCEPTWHENSHEISN'TPAYING.  There was no way I was putting up with this...was I?  Oh god...we agreed to go to a movie afterwards

&gt;Yay salad!

&gt;YAY BREADSTICK WITH SALAD!

&gt;Oh god

&gt;wonder if she'll even taste them

&gt;LOLNOPE

&gt;Ugh...this is making me ill.

I got about four bites of my salad down before I couldn't take it and got up

&gt;""I TOLD YOU SALAD WAS BAD FOR YOU

The plot really thickens with this story while I was in the bathroom.  The waiter was coming by to see if we needed anything else and interrupted tub-of-fun as she was on the phone....with FakeFriend.  The waiter immediately realized just what was going on.  Luckily for me

&gt;didn't throw up

&gt;still don't feel well

&gt;doubt I'll even eat anything

&gt;doggie bags rule

&gt;not putting up with the theater

&gt;My waiter is...is he waving me down?

&gt;""Sir

&gt;That she is a detriment to the human race?

&gt;The most disgusting thing you've ever seen?

&gt;Incapable of satisfying her own hunger?

&gt;I'll take D) All of the above

&gt;""What do you mean?""

&gt;Waiter takes a deep breath

&gt;""I was coming to check on your drinks and she was on the phone...""

The waiter explained to me that he overheard tub-of-fun saying how great it was that this practical joke was going so well.  I'll shorten up the exchange by basically saying that FakeFriend was apparently getting back at me for losing money at poker, but now I realized she probably had nothing to do with it.

&gt;pissed off at the world

&gt;mainly just FakeFriend

&gt;going to kill him

&gt;wonder if they serve shrimp in prison?

&gt;probably not

&gt;there has to be a way out of this.

&gt;should have realized that this was a....help me out here

&gt;thanks bud

&gt;what the hell do I do?

&gt;sit back down at the table

&gt;appetizers are obliterated

&gt;my breadstick is gone

&gt;can't eat salad anyways

&gt;""Good for you

&gt;That salad was tasty...

&gt;you know nothing...Jon Snow?

&gt;he's holding five plates for two people

&gt;don't even ask

&gt;JudeLaw hands my fettucine to me

&gt;He can tell I'm upset beyond belief

&gt;wheels are turning

&gt;GENIUS STRIKES ME!

&gt;she's eyeing my plate.

&gt;You have no clue what I'm capable of when pushed far enough.

&gt;lol you're about to find out

&gt;JudeLaw is back.  Asking about desserts.

&gt;....did she say three pieces of Tiramisu?

&gt;She really is out to make me pay

&gt;Waiter looks at me and I don't even say anything.

&gt;He asks if I need a box.

&gt;I nod.

As soon as JudeLaw left

&gt;""Hey

&gt;JudeLaw looks a bit confused

&gt;Maybe he knows what I'm planning.

&gt;""Do you need something

&gt;I doubt this conversation will need it.

&gt;""Split up the check for just my stuff.  I'll give you my card.  Have it ready for me when I get out of the bathroom.""

&gt;JudeLaw looks like he's going to enjoy this.

&gt;Good guy Jude?

Sure enough

&gt;""I'm going to make sure you earn what you'll put up with.""

&gt;JudeLaw nods and grins.

&gt;Dude could be my long lost brother at this rate

&gt;Scary we are thinking the same thing.

&gt;""Works for me.  How much time do you need?""

&gt;""Just wait ten minutes please....then give her the check.""

&gt;JudeLaw and I burst into laughter.  Group of six right behind us are fearful we are blowing something up.

&gt;Note to self:  Come back here in two weeks just to ask how it went

I open up the black check holder and sign off on a 50 dollar tip for Jude.  He's about to earn it while I punch my ticket to Hell.

&gt;also doesn't realize it didn't work

**EPILOGUE!!!**

I ended up calling SexyHostess the next night to see about that date and to find out what the hell happened.  Turned out that tub-of-fun, who explained most of the story (leaving out the part where he actually knew I was sticking her with the bill) and claimed ignorance on what happened to me.  Her bill was over $100 and ended up having to arrange to pay it at a later date when she could.  She had to give them all her information and everything.  Of course, this was AFTER a nuclear explosion when JudeLaw gave her the check.  Much bellowing occurred and many jimmies were rustled.  SexyHostess and I had a few dates, nothing major, but did enjoy some sexytimes together.  FakeFriend's girlfriend broke up with him after finding out what he did to set me up and used her as the excuse.  She came over a couple of weeks after the fallout to apologize for him half-heartedly, but mainly to say she was just sorry I had to deal with it.

1373141089.0,1hrj21,Gym Class Trauma: Dwarf Planet vs. Nerd Girl [Long],Poor-Yorick,473,94,70,"Hey guys! I'm assuming this is where I put my spiel about this being my first time posting, but I thought you fine folks might enjoy this little tale anyway. 

To start, rock climber, generally outdoors-y person all my life (including the time this takes place). This tale begins around 2005 or so, when I was a wee little fifth grader at a small-town elementary school. I mean ""wee little"" in a very literal sense here, I was a good 4 or 5 inches shorter than the rest of my class, very small and skinny for my age. Around this time, my school caught a windfall and decided to install a sort of horizontal [rock wall](http://www.swlakids.org/new_folder/Rock_Wall_web_2.jpg) in the gym. It stretched along one side of the room, I was very excited to try out ""The Wall"" (as they called it) when it opened. 

However, nearly as wide as she was tall, who we'll call Pluto for the sake of this retelling. Now, me being the friendless individual I was, I tried to make nice with this interloper. We became sort-of friends, but what usually ended up happening was her being nice to me, then turning around and making fun of me in order to make other people like her. Granted, I was the easier target in this situation. The town I grew up in was fairly affluent and mostly full of little baseball players/cheerleaders, so I stuck with her for what seemed like the longest week of my life. Sat by her in class, so despite my being extremely beta

Then on Thursday

I stood on my toes at the back of the class and listened eagerly as our teacher explained the rules. No pushing, all that jazz. She began laying out mats and explaining our first game: we were to climb across the wall once using any handholds available, then repeat using only the red/green/etc. By this point I was practically vibrating with excitement. Pluto, on the other hand, stood off to my right looking like Twinkies had gone extinct. I chose to ignore the clouds gathering across her pug-like face, and scooted a few inches away to get a better look. However, as the class began to line up

**Partner up!**

*Partner? For what?!* I thought to myself. I'd always enjoyed climbing trees and rocks and such, the only person I knew in the class was......you guessed it, Pluto. As the rest of the class scrambled to pair up, I was unsurprisingly left standing alone; when I turned to find my partner-by-default, however, I realized she'd vanished. I quietly moved to the back of the line, hoping no one would notice and I could get through the line alone or with a teacher's help. 

My classmates began scrambling across the wall in pairs, teacher in hot pursuit. Apparently, she'd tried to sneak into the bathroom to avoid any sort of physical activity. Luckily for her (and incredibly unluckily for me), running across the *whole entire elementary school gymnasium* was just too much for her and she stopped about halfway across, with a face as red as a cherry and snorting like a charging bull. She made some excuse about her KNEEEEES and her BAAACK and her ASTHMA ATTACKS but the teacher was having none of it. Suddenly, as she glanced toward the class standing in pairs, a stomach-turning thought hit me

*""Miss Gym-Teacher

She pulled an Oscar-worthy pout as she said it, because after scanning the group for a moment, the teacher sighed and asked ""Would anyone like to come be Pluto's partner? Remember the way we're supposed to treat new students!"" Not a single hand went up, and the whole class was suddenly enraptured with their shoelaces. Looking back, I feel bad for the teacher, she was faced with a difficult decision here. A child Pluto's size would be difficult for an *adult* to catch, but surely she couldn't do much damage when she's 18 inches off the ground? Nevertheless, as fate would have it

As I stood in the line listening to her grumble, I could complain to the teacher that having her as my partner was unsafe. It *was* unsafe, as it turned out, but for reasons yet unknown to me or anyone else. So I stretched my skinny little arms and rolled my skinny little shoulders and when it was my turn to scale the wall, I took off like a rocket. Years of hiking and rock climbing with my dad suddenly paid off, and as I reached the halfway mark, I glanced back to see her a good 10ft behind me, followed by a dull **THUMP** like a sack of flour falling off a cliff. This unexpected noise was too much for my nervous disposition; I lost my grip and fell flat on my ass. Pluto was no closer than she had been before I fell

""Teacher! Poor-Yorick is going too fast

This child had literally stopped walking, but once again, my desire to be liked won out. I gritted my teeth and stood up from the mat. Despite her shooting dagger glares and the class balking at me over her shoulders, I walked over and offered her a hand to get up. The teacher seemed pleased by this, and asked us to continue, adding ""...and try to go a bit *slower* this time, Poor-Yorick. Just to make sure you're safe."" 

I sighed and continued my trip along the wall, my little stunt had earned me a sort of heroine-status, as if by embarrassing her I'd defeated some kind of monster. I chatted away with a few of them while the rest of the class climbed, and found some common ground in our mutual dislike of Pluto. Unfortunately, this conversation didn't last long. The worst was yet to come. 

A whistle from the other end of the room signified the end of the first round, but I shook them out of my head and prepared for the worst. As the line grew shorter and shorter, I closed my eyes and prayed to every god I could think of, begging for death or a different partner. 

A few eternities later, I was roughly 4"" shorter than her and very nearly 100 lbs lighter. She was tall for her age and very round. I was short and slightly undernourished, although years of excelling in all things gym class had given me a bit of an inflated ego about my size; that is, I thought I was bigger (and stronger) than I really was. So, blissfully unaware of the danger I left my dignity at the starting line and went to take my place. I cracked my knuckles, set my jaw, crouched on the safety mat behind her

And waited. 

And waited. 

It eventually came to my attention that Pluto was not planning on climbing. She stood with her feet spread and her arms crossed, then begged, but she wasn't budging. It wasn't until the class asshole began making pig noises at her and the rest of the class started chanting ""Do it! Do it!"" that she broke her defiant stare and began to cry. However, the tears were very real this time, and that was a feeling I knew all too well. She was ill-mannered, she was mean to me, above anything else she was just unpleasant to be around; but she was still being teased. So,"" I told her. ""Do it one time and you'll never have to do it again. It's not that hard

*""Look

This was the first time in my life I'd raised my voice at school. Pluto (along with the rest of the class, and anyone else in earshot) was flabbergasted. I glared at her until she shot me a nasty look before turning, grumbling under her breath, back to the wall to start climbing. She stood on her toes and attempted to reach for the highest hand-hold available, and gave up after not reaching it. The teacher and student aid walked over, literally picked her up and placed her on the wall. 

Once I removed my jaw from the floor I resumed my crouching position behind her

*One step.*

She wobbled slightly

*Two steps.*

More wobbling

*Three steps.*

A missed foothold sends her lurching sideways. She desperately claws the air for any sort of grip

One final shriek flies out of her mouth

She falls in slow motion, the *smell* hit me as I was trapped there. Her thrashing around did nothing to lessen the suffocating mass covering my face, and the stench was one of leftover food, sweat, and too much cheap perfume covering something similar to wet dog. 

*This is the end

And then, glorious air hit me. I bolted and collapsed in a heap a few feet away. The crunching sound was not any of my bones, but my glasses. My nose had been flattened by the impact, and her flailing had smeared blood all over my face and shirt. I was furious, but too stunned to do anything about it. I gasped and choked as I tried to breathe again, being crushed to the floor had knocked the wind out of me.

1371751423.0,1gqorz,Uncle Tito and His Rotting Foot,kitsuneninja15,445,66,115,"Earlier this week

We were waiting at the airport for my uncle's family to arrive when my younger cousin jumped on me, and when he finally neared, his stench of a combination of body odor and not-quite-sure-what-else gently wafted towards us. While not entirely unbearable, it was certainly repulsive. He looked to be an inch or two over 5 feet, but what he lacked in height, he made up in girth. 

""Hey, ""I'm Uncle Tito!""

He was polite enough to greet us with a handshake and my father complied. We knew nothing of 'Uncle Tito'

""Great to meet you, ""I wasn't expecting you to be joining us!""

A quick explanation from my uncle and it was hinted that Tito had invited himself. So far he seemed a rather jolly fellow, expecting still a good vacation. Personally, I was wondering if he would be able to hike the trails.

Luckily for us, he ended up in the back of the airplane. The women on either side of him didn't look too happy to suffer his stench, one of them was pressed against the side of the plane, the other hanging over the aisle. Tito seemed blissfully unaware of the discomfort he was causing, and continued to happily munch away on the backpack of snacks he brought with him. I could have sworn he ate an entire box of moonpies and what could have literally been the last box of twinkies on earth during the 2 hour flight.

To be honest, but generally, he kept the pace fairly well. We did not have to even take too many breaks because of how scenic our hike was. My dad, being an avid photographer, would often stop to take pictures of everything.

We didn't even have too many problems with him except for his incessant chattering about silly things like how the birds here weren't as fat as the pigeons back where he lived

It wasn't until the last day when we got back from an entire day of fishing that any of us had any serious issue with him. We were sitting outside of our hotel, when we hear the most disgusting noise, an awful, awful, drawn out ""Sqqqqueeeelllllllcchhhhhh"". 

We all turned towards the source of the sound. Tito was slowly removing one of his socks after a long day of fishing, each of them excreting some foul, yellow fluid. His foot was so infected and so filled with pus that when he removed his sock, it started slowly dripping from his foot onto the floor, making a small puddle next to the pus-soaked sock he had dropped on the ground. 

Then the smell. Oh god

It smelled of excretion

I couldn't believe it. Nobody could believe it. I could not tear my eyes away, wondering what the hell could have happened for his foot to become that way. 

""Were you walking on that all day?!"" My father jumped to his feet and his face

""Oh, it's no big deal.."" 

""No big deal?! Your foot is completely infected

""Eh, so I left them at home."" Tito was now picking at the dead flesh, tearing off pieces here and there, unceremoniously dropping them to the ground.

Here

Any sort of redeeming qualities Tito had were now completely overwhelmed by his stupidity. After prodding him for more information, and was given antibiotics to treat the infection. He did none of these things and even went fishing, where his feet would be submerged in water for hours at a time. The doctor, at that appointment, did some blood work and diagnosed him with Type II diabetes (Surprise, surprise...), which explained his lack of reaction to the pain

Later on we discovered that the infection was caused by him stepping on a toothpick. It had impaled through his foot, noticed when he picked enough at the dead skin in his foot to see it. When he finally managed to extract it, it removed an entire chunk of meat with it. 

We told him that he was probably going to lose his foot to the infection and the diabetes

When Tito went to find food while we were waiting at the airport for our return flight, and apologized profusely for his brother's behavior.

I still cannot get the smell out of my lungs.

Snorlax is visibly upset. Jimmies russling. Manager doesn't give a fuck. Manager is serious business. Snorlax gives Manager that thousand island glare.

Manager reminds us that Hooderps is an equal opportunity employer, whatevs, and that Hooderps Girls are representatives of an All American girl.

Snorlax waddles over to the hostess for a menu. Snorlax orders a mountain of wings with the mild sauce.

**""I'M STARVIN. I BEEN FIGHTING ANOREXICA. TEE HEE. I HAVE TO EAT

Snorlax's mouth looks like the maw of that worm thing on that asteroid that the Millenium Falcon lands on. Grooooss. She apparently can't wait for the food she ordered and pulls a McDerps bag out of a flab and starts eating. We are disgusted.

""Interview not go well?"" Blondie asks sweetly.

Apparently she doesn't have money either.

Manager smoothly responds that if she doesn't pay for the mountain of food she's ordered

Snorlax rolls out after grabbing their basket of wings.

Manager tells us we'll hear back in the next couple days and apologises for the disruption and that they enjoyed meeting all of us. Blondie gave me a grin and hoped we got hired together.

Enter me and my partner, typical taxi ride as we call it, knock on the door pick up the patient and ferry them to the hospital. I wish it was that, but as we approached the house we got a whiff of the most foul smelling odor I have ever come across. We thought that the person might have died. We rushed to the door and knock very hard hoping it was not a DOA. We hear a very bitchy ""come in"". So we open the door to find a woman, who I kid you not was over 800 lbs, nude, and sitting in her own excrement. This woman was physically lodged into her sofa and had been stuck there for two days. She was unable to get the the phone on the floor until then. Her home health nurse was on vacation and for some reason another was never sent. Luckily for this charming woman there was a larger minifridge adjacent to the couch stocked full of mountain dew, both from the sight and the smell. There was no way to get this woman unstuck without further assistance. We got the fire department on the line, and was all electric. It was beautiful, it didn't fail catastrophically

You thought that was the end, other than the stench, and excrement, there was another fluid in the mix. She was on her period, part of that horrible mixture was period blood, I wish I had never heard that, but I did.

Enjoy.

I was working in a movie theater when I was 18 and it was a horribly hot scorching day. My mom was in town and decided to be nice and bring me a delicious chocolate shake. It was between movie sets so there was absolutely no one in the ticket atrium and she decided to stay 
and chat for awhile.

A couple minutes into our chat a morbidly obese women and her 10ish year old son come in glistening like hams. The women says she's not seeing a movie but wants to get popcorn and a pop to watch a movie at home. Ok fair enough happens all the time.

I walk over to concession and proceed to get her popcorn. She wants a monster tub (160oz.) with extra butter layered 4 times. Ok 980 cals for the popcorn, and 4 layers. Ew. Ok fine, I make this horrible thing and she proceeds to pull out a wad of cash from her sweaty gross cleavage. She flops it on the table and it makes a sick splat noise. Nope. I explain to her that its a health hazard for me to touch that and she flips of course. My mom is still idling nearby watching this unfold.

I call down my manager who we explain the situation to and he actually backs me up saying theres no way we're putting that sweaty mass in our till. So she SCREAMS at me

Remember the 10ish year old kid? Well hes running around in circles in the lobby and doesn't realize his mother had waddled her way to the door. So naturally she starts to yell at him at the top of her lungs:

Waddler: ""JASON! JASON! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!? WE DO NOT RUN IN THIS FAMILY!!!""

My mom: ""Cleeeeeeeaaarrrly""

Waddler: ""... lets go Jason. Now!!""

So there's this state park that I go to about this time every year. I tend to want to be away from fireworks and very few people come to this place simply because to see anything cool

So I pull up and start getting myself situated, etc. That's when I heard the arguing. 

""YOU FUCKING FASCIST FAGGOT!!!""  

That piqued my interest. So I got finished and headed over to the ranger station to sign in and see what was up.

Enter the three huge pigs. They were yelling at the park ranger and just calling him names. I actually know this guy a bit. I've seen him every year and we shoot the shit before I go out. He's willing to bend the rules on certain things except for safety. Hence the argument questioning is sexuality and political orientation. 

""Ma'am this is simply an issue of safety. If you want to camp out at the site close to this station, I won't be able to get to you if something goes wrong""

""Fuck you

I guess the ball was in my court.

""Hey Ranger Rick."" I always make fun of him.

""Hey Rambo"" Dude always makes fun of my equipment every time.

""He's actually right. The park's maps are 1:100, you're screwed because that's a rough hike.""

She blew me off and Rick(not his real name, and if you don't stow those fireworks in your vehicle, I'm arresting you the minute you step out onto the trails. Your move."" 

The father grumbled and waddled his way over to the car with the(we thought) only pack of fireworks. And Rick starts into his lecture on the dangers of the mountains. 

I hand him a spare map with my planned route and itinerary, it's a pleasure cruise. My compatriots however, started complaining after the first five minutes. There wasn't a lot to complain about. The view was amazing. Even with the storm clouds rolling in, it was awesome. Then we hit the main trail. 

Holy mother of god

I pipped up ""Guys

when the father interrupted me with ""Are you calling my family fat!? Are you!? We'll throw down right here!"".

""...if you're hiking. Your body will cramp up because it's using energy to digest the food. Like swimming. Also

I got a mumbled ""Whatever faggot



I waited for them to finish and silently smoked and contemplated their obsession with gay people until we moved out. 

It just got worse from there. This trail, and steep downhill paths. It's called an expert trail for a reason. One mile might take you an hour on some parts. Another mile might take you three.

 My mystical prophesy that they'd get cramps proved to be accurate. They were stopping every ten minutes.  

During those stops

The fifth stop, this is an old road march trick. If you're hurting or feeling tired, it'll give you a bit of energy and give you something to focus on other than the pain"". 

That's when tubby dad yelled at me again. Also

He said ""Where's our candy?""

""You don't get any. Frankly

""Fuck you! **You** turn back you fucking faggot. Giving candy to a little kid like one of those faggots(That word again

Finally ""What the fuck is your problem!? I'm actually straight

""Fuck you, my IQ was dropping). Now give us the candy"".

""Give us the candy? Fuck you you fat piece of shit! I'm out!"" 



I shouldered my ruck and started walking with him and his wife shouting that I was a fairy behind me. 

I walked for another thirty minutes and it was starting to get dark. This is pretty dangerous on the trails. I stopped to smoke and I tied a red chem light to my ruck. I tend to try to be as visible as possible when I move at night on the trails. Also

All of a sudden I heard. ""Squirrel! OOOWWWEEE! HEEELLP

I turned and it got much louder. I thought the kid had seriously, he freaked out because the red light disappeared and he ran into a bunch of thorn bushes trying to catch up to me. 

He's damned lucky that he didn't run off a cliff. If I had turned the corner of the trail in another 100 meters

I cut him out of the thorns and he explained that it got dark so his parents couldn't see. In their fat addled brains

In my mind, but they sent their 14 year old son after me, alone in the dark woods, so that they could survive. Those fat selfish fucks"".

As I'm treating his cuts

We walked back and found his parents eating, I'd already told them once that day that this was a bad idea. 

I walked up and said, I don't like you two. From now on, you don't talk to me unless it's to ask a question. If you get confused about anything, fall back to rule one. Now tape these chem lights to the shoulder of your backpacks so I know where you are.""

I didn't really have a problem out of them for a while until we actually reached the campsite. I told them ""It's raining too hard to go near the stream. You guys set up here, then dismissed the thought because I didn't need the temptation. 

Now, and generally working through my issues in an admittedly unhealthy, drunkenly way. 

I set up my tent, and finally started into my beer. 

That's when Tubby jr came over. 

""My parent's wanted to know if you could start a fire for them."" 

Rage level

""Look

""Ok""

I finally said ""Did you eat dinner?"" He said that he didn't, but pull up a log.

I gave him my food. Let me tell you

I let him eat and told him point blank, but being gay isn't bad. I knew some phenomenal gay soldiers. And ""manning"" you up doesn't mean you're not. A lot of them were tougher than I was."" 

""And if you want to get fit

Around this moment, are you lighting a fire for us or what? Oh, can I have a beer?""

Yes

Next day

The rain made the water falls awesome. I ended up catch an release fishing with survival techniques(nothing pre-made except the line)

I came back to find that some of my unopened food and all my whiskey was gone. 

Hmm... who might the culprits be? I walked over and Mother cholesterol was going to town on my whiskey. It was about a quarter low on a gallon of whiskey. I don't drink liquor often

Rage 9/10.

I flipped. I started yelling that they had robbed my camp. I really wanted to kick someone's ass. Being an asshole is one thing

The mother slurred the nearest approximation of ""Well

I started yelling and the father did his ""I'm going to kick your ass"" routine again, but a bit tipsy himself. 

In hindsight, and the thieves were trying to threaten me. That doesn't excuse what I did, but it explains where I was at in my mind. I took my left index and middle finger, curled them in front of his face while he was yelling, and struck him beneath the sternum with the first two joints of those fingers. It dropped him to his knees.

Mind you, I said, ""That's what I can do with two fingers. Fuck with me again and I'll show you some shit. Don't steal from me again"".

Later that night

Again, and I'd pour a shot into the fire and drink a shot. 

That's when the fireworks started. I heard whistling and then a BOOM. Time to round up the usual suspects. You need to understand how long it takes a cripple to walk 50 meters through the woods. By the time I got there

That's not a good thing. I walked up and those idiots had a bunch of those kits that they sell for the 4th. They couldn't light a fire

After the incident earlier that day

I hiked out early because I wasn't getting anything from the trip because of them.   

They left with me. Funnest moment here. I always let the guys at the ranger station know when I'm leaving. As I was leaving

Rick said ""Hey

I said ""Yeah

This is why I like this ranger. He told them like it was again. ""You threatened a disabled person. He struck you. That's within lines with disparity of force laws in this state. You stole his alcohol. He shouldn't have had alcohol here, that means I have to lock you up too. Seriously, go home, or go to jail. Those are your options.""

[The Epic of Porcina – Chapter Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jdo15/the_epic_of_porcina_chapter_two/)

**Chapter Three**

The meal was finished, slurped every trace of each entree from each of our three plates, pausing only once to wink at me and state, “I'm *very* good with my tongue!” I offered a forced smile and a nod in return, certain as I was that any similarly sexual language from me would result in another inappropriate outburst from her. I am not, as I have mentioned, a particularly passive individual – especially not back then – but I was quickly learning that keeping quiet was the best way to avoid an embarrassing scene.

When, I began to hope that the nightmare was nearly over. Only a few coins were left as a tip, with each of the bills going into an envelope that Porcina kept in her baby blue purse. “You know, a standard tip is fifteen percent,” I said, eying the rather pathetic gratuity.

“She didn't do anything right, I sarcastically considered, the waitress would have been offered more if she had flashed us. Another thought occurred to me then, and before I had given it any due consideration, I heard myself speaking.

“Oh, “your breasts looked a bit different from the picture you sent me.”

A cold stare accompanied Porcina's response. “*What* do you mean by *that*?” she demanded. “Do you think I'm just some kind of *slut*? Do you think I show my boobs to *everyone*?”

“That's not what I meant.” I glanced around, I noticed that they were different from the ones in your picture.”

Her icy gaze persisted a moment longer... and was suddenly replaced by the same beaming smile I had already come to loathe. “Well of *course* they looked different! Those weren't *my* boobs, I wondered, would she post a picture of someone else's chest, especially when she clearly had no qualms about exhibitionism? I kept my questions to myself, intent as I was on leaving without further incident.

I slid out of the booth and stood, was leave on a decent note, even if I would never be speaking to her again. Her own departure was a much more involved affair, a spirited reprise of her method of entry. First, she turned sideways, kicking her feet up onto the bench. With one hand on the table and another on the back of her seat, she scooted herself forward, and she looked up at me with what was likely meant to be an endearing gaze.

“Help me up?” she asked, she popped free of the booth and staggered into my chest. “You're so *strong*,” she gushed. “I bet you like things *rough*.” I offered a noncommittal murmur, and made my way towards the door... only to pause when I discovered that Porcina was quite a ways behind me, having stopped to examine yet another patron's plate. “Ooooooh, I should get *that* next time!” she all but bellowed. “Doesn't it look *good*?”

“It looks great

“Wait!” she protested. “Stop! Slow down! Wait!” We passed through the vestibule a few second later, “that was *really fucking rude*!”

I sighed. “I'm sorry. I wanted to get out of there before our waitress saw what a pathetic tip we left.” Although I didn't say it

“She deserved it!” Porcina pouted. “She was *rude* the whole time and she got everything wrong.”

Was it possible, no-nonsense waitress who had been prompt, efficient, and friendly. The only objectionable person had been Porcina, with her incessant admonishments and abhorrent table manners. I supposed there was a *chance* that I was simply misremembering... but it seemed more than a little unlikely.

My thoughts were interrupted by Porcina switching back to her little girl persona. “Soooo... where's your *car*?” she asked

“Uh... it's over there

“Nooooo, Porcina had given every indication that she had arrived at the diner on her own, and – as her numerous angry outbursts had suggested – would be leaving on her own, as well.

For the second time in as many minutes

The walk to my car was uneventful, she'd lose an entire letter grade. “It's so *high school* there! This is *college*! It shouldn't *matter* if I'm absent!” While I agreed with her to a point, that sentiment quickly evaporated when she mentioned that the class in question met only weekly, and that it required group participation. If anything, it sounded like her instructor was being lenient.

Our arrival at my car was accompanied by a scoff of disapproval from Porcina. “*This* is what you drive?” I merely shrugged and opened the door for her. She didn't so much sit down as she did ooze into place... and then immediately opened my glove compartment and started ransacking the contents.

I walked around to the driver's-side door and let myself in. “Please stop that

“*Why*?” she spat. “Are you *hiding* something in here?”

“No, “but I prefer my things to be neatly arranged, and I don't like it when people go through them.”

To her credit, she turned and gave me a quizzical look. “Did you have something in mind?” she asked.

“How do you mean?”

“Well

Hormones are a terrible thing. For a moment – just a brief moment – I considered dismissing my resolve. Her unattractiveness aside, I thought... what's the harm in going all the way?

“Are you going, “to do something naughty to me?”

Just like that, “I'm not. You said I wasn't getting any tonight, remember?”

“Are you *suuuuuuure*?” She lifted up her sweatshirt, but something about her wanton promiscuity and overt sexuality was stimulating on its own. Thankfully, a car drove by just then, prompting Porcina to hastily cover herself, and allowing me a chance to reevaluate my priorities.

“I'm sure

Without so much as a sign of disappointment – which, she lived only a few blocks from the college, in one of the miniscule townhouses that I had once considered for myself. The drive was largely uneventful and – to my surprise – quiet. It was only after we had arrived at Porcina's house that she chose to speak up again.

“I promised my roommate I'd bring you inside!” she said suddenly. “Just for a minute!” 

I thought about making an excuse

The place was *immaculate*. I stood, trying to believe what my eyes were showing me. This woman, clad in unwashed sleepwear and slippers, lived in what could have been a scene from a furniture catalog. The floor was freshly vacuumed, the windows spotless... and was that a hint of lavender in the air?

“*LAUREN*!” Porcina shrieked

A door opened to my right, matched the state of the house. She was petite, slender, and had her long brown hair pulled back in a perfect ponytail. “Hello,” she all but whispered, her eyes not meeting mine.

“This is Lauren!” said Porcina. “I guess you guys have *kind of* already met!”

“How so?” I asked.

“*You've already seen her boobs!*” laughed Porcina.

The horror I felt in realizing what she meant was only compounded when I saw the look of shame on Lauren's face.

&gt;He finished a 3 litre of soda in one bout of gulping

&gt;Must have blow hole on back to take in air while his mouth is full

&gt;""But the syllabus doesn't say anything about no eating during class!""

&gt;Professor says its ok to eat

&gt;Hamgar is for a moment

&gt;Soon he is back to shoveling chips into his mouth like an earth mover shovels dirt into a lake (believe he is now on 2nd family sized bag)

&gt;Professor looks annoyed

&gt;Hamgar turns bright red

&gt;Professor informs the raging beast in soothing tones that other people are eating quietly

&gt;Hamgar continues to rage

&gt; Professor says we will take a 20 minutes break

&gt;Hamgar

&gt;Tries to take first step

&gt;Tells professor he can't make it down the stairs

&gt;Professor walks up the stairs and takes Hamgar to the corner of the room to talk

&gt;I pity the poor man having to be in such close proximity to such a foul smell

&gt;I can only hear murmuring from the two

&gt;Things obviously weren't going well when the teacher went to the front of the room

&gt;A few minutes later

&gt;Hamgar goes back to his seat and continues his war against the chip kingdom

&gt;As those who left the classroom begin to come back in

&gt;Professor begins his lecture but is interrupted a few words in by a *tsst* followed by the sound of a sucking sewer pipe

&gt;2 3 liters of soda in under 2 hours

&gt;Class continues like this with Hamgar going through 3 family sized bags of chips (might have been 4

First story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ar8op/she_wanted_to_ride_a_horse/)

Just a forewarning

So this happened on the same farm as in the last story. I wasn't clear, because the owners were awful. 

As I mentioned before

A lot of the time, which was great. 

Enter the story's subject. 

13-14ish, so I wasn't judging her based on appearance. She also had no experience, which as I said wasn't new, I knew teaching her would take some time. 

Most workers pick up the basics within two days. They're pretty straight forward. 

So I started her the same way I started everyone else, and telling her to lead it out to the hitching posts and I would be out shortly to show her how to tie. Her question?

""Am I going to ride him?"" 

No

So we go through the day and she keeps asking if she's going to get to ride, mostly a lot of walking. Didn't even need to haul bales. I tell her to go take 5 on the straw bale stack and maybe grab some lunch, but to hurry because she had some pony rides for a birthday party to take care of. 

So she grabbed her large bag of lunch (I remember there were multiple sandwiches, and who knows what else... but whatever, not judging, remember? Trying really hard...) and plopped onto a bale to dig in while I groomed and saddled the ponies. When I was done, she hadn't shown, so I spent a few minutes adding a couple of things to the ponies to make them cute for the birthday party (if I ever had spare minutes I liked to help the kids out with setting the manes and tails up for braiding and ribbons, you know... girls... haha). And after I was done she was still not there. 

So I go back and she's still sitting there, time to ""man up"" and give her the two ponies to take out so I can get a trail ride ready. 

So she takes off and I know another worker will meet her out there to run the party together and show her the ropes. New workers = pony rides, and then go to get the customers mounted. 

Small moon (SM?)'s sitting on my horse. 

*My* horse. You know

She is SITTING ON HER. 

Ask her what the hell she thinks she's doing. She says ""I want to help on the trails! So I thought I'd get ready to go!""

The bridle is on wrong. My horse looks miserable. My horse was gorgeous, now, take the bridle off, and to never touch her again. She whined and said it wasn't fair, called the horse ""her favourite"" (she didn't know I owned her at this point) and that she deserved to ride for all the hard work she'd (I'd) done. 

I make her go back to the ponies. 

She pulled this multiple times over the next week. I'd go out to find her already on a horse and ""ready to go."" I'd taken her out once that week just to see how well she rode, among other things including incredible amounts of fat logic tossed in. 

She was not learning. She still couldn't tie a slip knot properly (it takes 30 seconds and doing it twice to learn)

Literally broke down crying the first day we had to unload square bales from the truck (60lbs each x 1500 of them) because she was too tired and was ""going to throw up."" Left two of use to do all 1500 by ourselves. 

Every time we tried to make her help us clean out stalls (read: poop-scooping) she would break down gagging and choking and run out in tears because ""poo is so gross!"" 

Whenever I asked her to soap down the saddles to keep the leather good, then cry when I told her to redo it because she ""hadn't gotten to touch a horse in hours and that's what she's there to do."" 

She would not leave my horse alone. Every day she came up to me and asked if she could ride her. Whined when I said no. Said I was being selfish and unfair. 

Would ask to ride the in-training/young horses. Not sure why she wanted to so bad

She was always eating. She always had pop, chips... we would find chip bags crammed into the crevices of the saddle rack, and when we bitched her out she would deny it was her. 

Brought fast food to work a lot

One day told a worker she was assisting (watching out for safety of passengers) on a wagon that she knew how to drive a team and told the worker to let her try. So the worker was like, too. I was livid.

So, and then decided she was going to go all-out grooming her. 

She cut her mane. 

This was my SHOW HORSE. Everyone on that farm knew I was a stickler about grooming and clipping, is RIGHT. 

She had this gorgeous long, and this idiot chops it into REALLY BAD [HUNTER CUT](http://www.regardinghorses.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/finished-mane.jpg). 

The picture I showed at the start was about 2 months after this incident, appearance was important, especially after I put so much time and money into it. 

I spent an hour screaming at this girl and telling her if I ever caught her breathing on my horse again I would end her. 

The whole time she is crying and telling me I hate her because she's fat and that she's bullied in school (I wasn't even thin then, that I work her so hard (she had the easiest workload out of everyone) because I hated fat people and maybe I should look in a mirror. 

I told her I was hard on her because she was a shit horseperson

I don't think she ever came back after that. I'm glad. She's the only fat person I ever had to work with on that farm

**TL;DR**: Lazy fat new coworker becomes obsessed with my horse. Refuses to do regular work around the farm but found enough time to give ""special treatment"" to my animal and ruin her show mane.

**Chapter Nine**

The townhouse was dark and silent when I arrived. Was it, and concluded that I was definitely in the right place, but the apparent absence of life in the dwelling was something less than encouraging. I approached hesitantly, then pressed my thumb against the dirty glow of the doorbell.

An audible chime sounded from behind the building's threshold

I opened the door a crack. “Porcina?”

“In here!” she cooed in reply.

I stepped into the dimly lit room, its limited appeal thoroughly marred by the mixed-in stench of sweat and stale perfume. Gone was the pristine landscape of Lauren's home, replaced by the cesspit of offal and excess inhabited by Porcina... though the denizen herself was nowhere in sight.

“Porcina?” I called again.

I could hear her sibilant laugh as she replied. “In here!” she said again. I turned to face the source of the sound, but a piece of errant packaging, such as one might find in a box for retail electronics.) I had an idea of what to expect when I entered Porcina's room... and it was with some relief that my fears were proven to be unwarranted. I found her laying on her bed beneath a comforter, her eyes glued to a large television set atop a dresser, with one hand firmly grasping a convenience store burrito.

Without wasting any time, I added, “Sorry it didn't work out between us.”

Porcina let out a huff of fetid breath. “*God*

“What?” I scoffed. I know that I should have let it go

“Yeah, rolling her eyes. “We did everything else, so whatever. I already told Lauren about it.”

My heart skipped a beat and made a kamikaze run for my stomach. “*What* did you tell her?” Porcina didn't answer. She kept staring at the television

“Nothing!” snapped Porcina. She took another sloppy chomp at her burrito. “*God*...”

I fought to keep from exploding. It was, however, I was so blinded by rage, by panic, that I was unable to think of anything beyond determining what she had said, and whether it had damaged Lauren's fledgling perceptions of me.

“Porcina, “this really isn't funny. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea, but spreading rumors about...” I barely stopped myself from saying “about us,” “... but spreading rumors about me isn't an appropriate response.” I moved to step just slightly between Porcina and the television. “Will you *please* tell me what you said?”

“*God* why do you *care*?” the young woman rumbled.

Apparently, was a very small consolation. “Because it isn't *true*!” I answered. “We went out to dinner. You flashed me. That's *it*.”

“What about when you *kiiiiiissed* me?” Porcina said. Her voice had made a shift toward a childlike tone and meter

“*You* kissed *me*

“You liked it, her comforter fell away, revealing that my previous fears had been justified all along. With another motion from her hand – the one not clutching the remnants of preprocessed Mexican food – Porcina revealed herself completely, exposing acres of naked flesh pockmarked by valleys of stretch-marks and rolling hills of fat. “You liked it and you wanted *more*,” she hissed. Her voice dropped to a throaty whisper. “You couldn't *wait* to get your hands on me. You've been jacking off all day, just *thinking* about it.”

“Stop it, and the thrice-damned *hormones* were all coalescing into a cascade of confusing impulses and instincts. Only my anger, my fear at losing Lauren forever, remained as beacon for navigation in the tumultuous sea of my tempestuous emotions. “*Stop it*!” I said again, louder. I dropped Porcina's money on the floor – let *her* find it amidst the squalor – and backed away from the source of my vexation. “This is *sick*, Porcina. I'm sorry. No, actually, and *nothing ever will*. You flashed me

My words, she slowed in her advance and slumped back down onto her bed. My blood was racing through my veins, saturated with adrenaline. I could feel my heart pounding, and I realized that I was short of breath. I stood there, almost panting, as I fought to relax. Despite all of my confusion, I knew one thing for sure: Whatever came next

Then

It started as a puffiness in her cheeks and a squinting of her eyes. Her many chins jiggled as her bottom lip began to quaver, setting herself into a screaming, bouncing tantrum. The force of each rebound rippled through her form, creating a spectacle of undulating skin accompanied by a cacophony of blubbering screams.

Terror consumed me at the sight.

I had to escape.

I had to escape.

*I had to escape*. I stumbled backwards for the door, but my words were drowned out before they could leave my lips. Then, as I exited the room, I felt my back connect with an object which hadn't been there before... and I turned, wide-eyed, to see Lauren, clad only in her panties.

Suddenly, the girl with whom I had become all but obsessed, looked up at me. Some part of my mind was vaguely aware that the stillness was an illusion, that the nightmare was continuing beyond the reach of my senses... but I could hear nothing, *see* nothing, beyond the anger in Lauren's eyes.

“I think you should go

Hello, I worded the shit out of this bitch) about our deliciously gorging glutton. First, we'll do an update sans greentext for her current diet tips and exercise routine that I tried to suggest to her.

She has been going on walks *everyday*. Her mother was in once last week and told me how *proud* she was that RW is finally taking control of her life. RW has apparently been (attempting) to prepare healthy meals and not drowning everything in fat, but still is falling back on soda and sweet tea. She's still eating waaaaaaaaaaaay too much candy and snacks.

So she's trying! Way to go RW!

Until this past week at work

We recently had an inspection of the store by those fancy higher up dudes in suits who like to judge you on your entire existence within the universe by the fact that they are above you (and thus

&gt; Prepping like a motherfucker for Fancy Pants arrival

&gt; Everything clean

&gt; Running around like a crazy bitch in a store that's way too fucking hot (srsly like 80 degrees inside

&gt; Take a drink of sweet

&gt; FANCY PANTS HAS ARRIVED

&gt; Fancy Pants stops and glares

&gt; Me ""Taking a drink of water? It's quite warm in here.""

&gt; Fancy Pants

&gt; Me ""It's water

&gt; Fancy Pants ""We'll be discussing this with your manager.""

&gt; GO FOR IT BROS

&gt; RW shows up for her shift! Has become increasingly more tolerable toward me of late because of past helps rendered

&gt; RW ""I walked five miles this morning! I made myself a smoothie for breakfast and I haven't snacked at all today! I feel really good about myself.""

&gt; Me (srsly happy) ""That's so awesome

&gt; RW ""It's *really* hard. But you know

&gt; Oh sweet jesus, but goddamn.

&gt; Re-enter Fancy Pants with managers in tow!

&gt; Fancy Pants points at me ""This *girl* was backtalking us when we came in. She's *extremely* unprofessional and a detriment to the customer service position.""

&gt; LOL WHAT

&gt; Managers defend me, etc etc

&gt; Fancy Pants is not convinced.

&gt; RW stands up for me

&gt; Dem eye waters...

&gt; Fancy Pants ""She was drinking water behind the customer service desk. Unprofessional.""

&gt; RW ""Haha

&gt; OH MY GOD WOMAN

&gt; Fancy pants glares

&gt; RW ""Well, I don't want to put myself in a position to pass out. So the sugar and tea keep me energized, which is better for the customers!""

&gt; ohmygodohmygodohmygod what are you doing stop it please

&gt; Fancy Pants

&gt; RW goes pale and looks a little stunned

&gt; Fancy Pants ""From now on, no eating at or around the desk.""

&gt; LOUD WHALE SONG OF DISTRESS ECHOES THROUGH THE AGES

&gt; RW ""You can't dooooooooo that! I have a medical condition! If I pass out I can sue you! I neeeeeeeeeed to keep my blood sugar up! You don't understand what it's like to be a woman!""

&gt; Me ""I think it's a little unfair that we can't at least keep water up here

&gt; RW ""OH SHUT UP

&gt; Literally threw my hands up in the air and shook my head

&gt; Fancy Pants and managers walk away from the desk

&gt; Day ends

&gt; No food. No sodas. No advertising beverages.

&gt; RW glares at me as I'm leaving to go home

&gt; RW ""This is *all* **your** *fault*. I can't believe you'd *stab* me in the *back* like this! And I *trusted you!*

&gt; Me ""Yeah

&gt; EXIT STAGE RIGHT

Okay

TL;DR - Big wigs yell at me and RW for being unprofessional because I took a drink of water. RW explodes like a twat, GTFO.

&gt; ST clearly didn't run 

&gt; watch as ST completely disregards the bottles of water and the healthy snacks

&gt; grabs handfuls of the mini bags of Cheez-Its

&gt; several people also suspect she didn't run in the race

&gt; Worker there helping hand out the water and snacks stops her

&gt; ""I'm sorry

&gt; ""BUT AHM SOO HUNGRAY"" THERES 'NUFF FOOD FOR MEH TOOO!""

&gt; ST screeches something about him not being fair

&gt; ST grabs another handful and takes off

&gt; by now the worker is trying to chase after her

&gt; ST literally tears through the bag with her mouth and starts devouring the Cheez-Its

&gt; makes her way out of the crowd of people only to be tripped by someone

&gt; watch as 350 lbs hits the concrete in one fast motion

&gt; hear the splat sound

&gt; see her rolls sway back and forth

&gt; ST grabs the opened bag of food and stuffs herself with the remaining Cheez-Its while trying to hide embarassment

&gt;Be me (5'9 132 pounds/size 6)

&gt;School dance is approaching so we go to the mall to look for dresses

&gt;Only one store in the whole mall sells anything smaller than 0 so we go there first

&gt;Sara asks counter girl if they sell plus sizes

&gt;Gets all huffy when they say no

&gt;Tell her there are a few plus size shops here we can go to next

&gt;Kay looks through all the racks. Only 3 size 00 dresses in the whole store

&gt;Gets frustrated because they are all too short or too loose

&gt;Decides to just get one online

&gt;Sara mentions maybe Kay should get ""some meat on her bones"" makes the whole only dog like bones analogy

&gt;Kay stifles laugh and says ""I'll think about it Sara"" (Kay got hit on just about constantly)

&gt;We go to the first plus size shop the stickers on the door read ""We carry sizes 2-24""

&gt;Sara says she wears 26

&gt;We go the next shop that sells up to a size 28

&gt;She grabs some size 26 dresses and goes to the dressing room

&gt;Several minutes pass and suddenly her head pops up from the door

&gt;THERE DRESSES ARE MARKED WRONG!!!!!!! THEY DON'T FIT ME!!!!

&gt;Ask her if she wants me to grab her some of the 28's

&gt;Throws hands up in the air and says ""Well since this places lies about there sizes I guess you'll have to"" (my sister is heavy and had bought clothes there before and said they actually ran big)

&gt;Me and Kay pick 5 or 6 dresses off the rack and pass them over the door to her

&gt;Several more minutes pass until finally she cracks the door and sticks her head out

&gt;""Hey can one of you zip me up?""

&gt;I walk up to her and she turns around

&gt;Oh my god. Nothing

&gt;I grab on the zipper and try not the touch the waterfalls of back fat

&gt;Yank

&gt;Nothing

&gt;Yank harder

&gt;Hurts my hand I'm pulling so hard

&gt;Nope. This dress is at full capacity and it's not even zipped yet.

&gt;Try to tell her but she doesn't want to hear it

&gt;Slams the door and changes back into her clothes

&gt;When she leave she immediately heads to the register and demands to talk to the manager

&gt;Managers not in

&gt;She starts unloading her rage on cashier

&gt;Poor girl

&gt;Screaming about how the store is horrible for not carrying ""all the plus sizes"" and everyone who works there are fat hating assholes

&gt;Walks back to us with a huge smile on her face. Proud that she has showed everyone how wrong they are

I want to leave. I want to tell her to go home. I want to punch her in the face. I want to scream that Kay didn't act like that when the store didn't carry dresses that fit her

&gt;Be me

&gt;Friends with Yuki

&gt;Yuki's an international student from Japan

&gt;Very thick Japanese accent

&gt;Yuki wants to go to Disneyland over break

&gt;Does throwing_pies want to go with?

&gt;Do the ursae shit in the woods?

&gt;Don't answer that

&gt;In any case

&gt;Off we fly

&gt;arrive

&gt;more fatties than usual

&gt;first day there

&gt;Yuki especially since she's never been there before

&gt;trying to go on all the rides 

&gt;pretty successful

&gt;as the sun's going down, sit and wait for it to start

&gt;weather's nice

&gt;good breeze

&gt;eating chocolate popcorn

&gt;been a good day

&gt;glad Yuki's enjoying her time in America

&gt;drawing together in a sketchbook Yuki carries everywhere (she's an art student) and talking

&gt;normal voices

&gt;popcorn suddenly starts jumping in bag

&gt;wat.jpg

&gt;ground rumbles

&gt;feeling tremors

&gt;is it the next great California earthquake?

&gt;look around

&gt;no one else seems panicked

&gt;look straight ahead

&gt;Ursula's gotten loose

&gt;Wait no

&gt;Not Ursula

&gt;It's the entire Medusa Nebula



Now
running at me and Yuki. It was pasty, maybe 5'10 and 400lbs. It was wearing black with neon pink and green bracelets. It had braces with neon pink and green bands; I know this because it had the most shit-eating grin running at us. On its legs, it had skinned the cheshire cat or some shit because it had these godawful neon purple furry legwarmers. On its eyes, it had black *squares* of eyeliner. Like a demented panda. Its hair? Pigtails with neon ribbons and neon fishnets or something. *It had pigtails made of tubes of bouncing, neon fishnet.* It looked alive. I don't fucking even. To this day, that hair haunts me.

&gt;Getting closer

&gt;it's seriously aiming for us

&gt;Yuki is frozen

&gt;Can barely look away myself

&gt;start seriously wondering if I'm going to have to tackle Yuki and I out of the way

&gt;Luckily

&gt;""KOHNEECHIWAR"" it blurbles

&gt;wut 

&gt;""I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING. YOU HAVE ACCENTS. YOU ARE FROM JAPAN?""

&gt;Yuki's still frozen in terror

&gt;""I'M MEDUSA! I JUST LOVE JAPAN.""

&gt;I'm still frozen in terror

&gt;""I LOVE ANIME GUYS

&gt;""US WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T BE TINY LIKE YOU. BUT LOOK AT YOU

&gt;Medusa's mostly talking to me at this point
interested in her sketchbook

&gt;You're killing me

&gt;""I'm... I'm sure with the right diet you can lose weight?""

&gt;""NOPE
FAT.""

&gt;mfw one of my best friends is white and skinnier than I am

&gt;""I have white friends who are much more athletic than me! They do a lot of running and eat a lot of vegetables. It isn't 
impossible!""

&gt;""WELL

&gt;Medusa at this point has decimated half her bag of popcorn

&gt;These are fucking huge bags of popcorn

&gt;It takes me three days to a week to finish one

&gt;Still clutching the bag of popcorn Yuki and I were sharing

&gt;""SEE, LET ME TRY SOME""

&gt;she suddenly stuffs her hand in

&gt;""What do you think you're doing? That's mine. That's not okay.""

&gt;It covers its mouth and giggles

&gt;""BUT IT JUST LOOKED REALLY GOOD! BESIDES

&gt;and then shit gets real

&gt;the thing reaches out with speed I didn't think it could have and grabs my arm

&gt;I'm wearing a long-sleeved dress with a slit that goes up the sleeves
along my entire arm

&gt;*she fucking starts running a finger along that line*

&gt;back and forth

&gt;slowly

&gt;I'm too revolted and shocked to react for a few seconds

&gt;it feels like seeping oil

&gt;she sounds like she's in a trance

&gt;her gaze would've turned me to stone but the rage was too strong

&gt;""*NO.* It is *not* okay to touch strangers like that. It's not funny. Do not touch me again."" 

&gt;Yuki's finally been paying attention since I bumped into her escaping Medusa

&gt;""Hey throwing_pies

&gt;""Oh... oh right

&gt;""WHAT?? BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WATCH THE FIREWORKS... THEY'RE GOING TO START SOON.""

&gt;""Well

&gt;turn around to leave when

&gt;lifted off the ground

&gt;being crushed by her girth

&gt;I struggle and try to shove her off but cannot fight the folds of fat

1372751301.0,1hhgtz,"My Triumphant Return ""rage follows""",Combustablesquirrel,449,82,110,"So I've gone back to a shrink for the first time in a long time. I know how Reddit loves proof

Prazosin is kind of standard to start out with for PTSD. I was told to stay off the internet for a while

So I've been seeing a shrink. I didn't like her to begin with, if real women have curves, this woman had Pi. I figured I wouldn't judge a book by it cover.  

I've seen her twice. Today was the second time. Let the story commence.

Be me. I'm on a new VA program that lets me get my masters degree for free for being a cripple. Whose dick do I have to suck? Well part of that involves me seeing a shrink. 

Fuck me. I suck it up. I saw a shrink in the army and it wasn't too bad. I figured if I have to see a shrink, both stemming from the war, and I wanted to advance my social life. I used to be a very sociable person. I'd like to be that way again. And I'd like to maintain a healthy weight. 

I looked at this as a mental health tune up. So I went to the VA. If you work at the VA, I've met some awesome VA workers on occasion, but it's not the norm). I'm about to trash the VA workers I saw. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs is 99.99% FPS material. 

So I show up. I check in and go to the waiting area. There are a few old timers there and I'm swapping war stories with them. Then there's a kid without his fucking legs in a scooter. He was trying to open the restroom door. His scooter couldn't push the door open. I hobbled over

I was kind of an asshole to the cool gay nurse who admitted me. He was nice, BP on the left arm where the arterial markers are. I can do this all myself. Why isn't there somebody in the hall making sure that handicap people can piss with dignity?"". Admittedly, he was pissed. It was ten o'clock and one fatty had abandoned her post to have a ""small snack"". 

Cool gay nurse was awesome. He said ""Bitch, I don't want to hear about your diet. Shut your mouth and do your fucking job"". 

I actually think I might have turned gay for a bit there. That nurse was a king among kings. 

Now I had to deal with my tubby shrink. 

Boss battle

I really didn't like this shrink because she eats in front of me and I feel that that's unprofessional. I'm not talking snacks. I'm talking she'll have a full bag of BK stackers. Picture her just eating in this conversation.

The first thing she said to me was that my weight was 175lbs. I said ""That's actually good. I've been trying to get to my Basic Training weight for a little over a year. That's tough with a bum leg"".  My shrink. The person who is supposed to lead me into mental health

I kind of consider it an achievement to be healthy without being able to run. 

I said ""Ok

And here comes the overture(Can't find a good V for Vendetta gif for the 1812 overture

Her: Before we really begin

I said ""I went through this in the army. That is stuff that is mission specific that you don't need to know and has no bearing on my mental health."" 

""Well as your Psychiatrist

Yay! I actually have the power for once! ""No Ma'am

""But frankly

""So anyway

&gt;Umm...What?

&gt;""What was that

&gt;""BAG ER MANERRR!""

&gt;Shit.

&gt;Literal shit.

The hammoth is asking for me to ring her up a bag of manure, and normally people would go out there to purchase fertilizer, as it's completely on the other end of the store.

&gt;""alright m'am

&gt;""Ah ent got all day!! You get it ferr me!""

&gt;""I'm sorry m'am, and he'll get that for you much faster than I could""

The hammoth refuses, and that I wasn't technically allowed to load heavy things, as it wasn't in my job description, I went and got her the enormous bag of manure she wanted. 

&gt;Hammoth remains silent

Several rude comments later

&gt;Something is amiss.

&gt;could it be...?

Though the Wooly Hammoth was supposedly immobile

&gt;There were at least 30 candy bars now in the cart.

&gt;She had somehow managed to cover it all with lumber while I was gone.

&gt;""Oh

&gt;The Wooly Hammoth stampedes.

&gt;""YOU ALREADY RUNG UP MERR CART

&gt;Umm...No.

&gt;""M'am

Back to me

&gt;MFW hear this guy might have killed himself because he didn’t want to eat soup (sound familiar?).

&gt;Get 3 units (450 ml in each unit) into him. Get verbal release for procedures and prepare to intubate. Because he is so critical
&gt;All of a sudden he crashes and starts going into [VFib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation) (your heart doing dubstep). 

&gt;Apply paddles “All clear!” Zap! Heart resets like a champ!

&gt;Call blood bank and have them send up another 5 units of radiolabeled blood. The plan is to give him radiolabeled blood (shows up on MRI)

&gt;Dream team of nurses and doctors are all working on him. 

&gt;All at once he crashes again! Going into VFib. 

&gt;Apply paddles “ALL CLEAR!” Zap! 


&gt;nothing...


&gt;”ALL CLEAR!” Zap! Heart resets like a champ again! He is going to make it!

&gt;Blood pressure is still dropping 40/20-30’s. 
The physicians are all commanding this scene like General Patton
“Get me 5 more units of blood up here stat!” 
“Call my OR team. I want them scrubbed in and ready to go in 30 minutes!”
“Make sure we have 10 more units on hand just in case.”

We are singlehandedly depleting the blood bank.

&gt;“Shit! His blood pressure is still dropping. Get me more blood now!”


&gt;“Bring me the blood prepped for surgery too! I don’t care...he won’t ever live to bleed out in surgery if he bleeds out up here!” 

&gt;“Forget the MRI


FYI there are only about 14 units of blood in the human body. If you have been keeping count you will notice that there was around 23 units of blood that were being pumped into him. Meaning that he had probably 30+ units of blood filling up his GI tract (mouth&gt;stomach&gt;small intestine&gt;large intestine&gt;anus)

&gt;Surgical team is prepped in the OR. 

&gt;Another hospital is rushing us over more blood. 

&gt;We have unlocked the wheels on his bed and are about to take him out when suddenly his blood pressure drops to almost nothing. 

&gt;All of a sudden he crashes again. 

&gt;His heart goes into VFib.

&gt;Apply paddles “ALL CLEAR!” Zap! 

&gt;nothing....

&gt;“ALL CLEAR!” Zap!

&gt;nothing...

Allow me to paint the scene a little better. 

Every alarm in the ICU possible is going off

1 500+ lbs man with a GI tract full of nearly 30 units of blood and untold amounts of shit

8-10 doctors dressed in crisp white lab coats shouting orders and yelling into walkie talkies

12 ICU nurses dressed in freshly pressed navy scrubs in various states of panic and action

6 OR nurses dressed in baby blue scrubs ready to transport

Me standing in the doorway about to remove the room partition to help get the bed out
dressed in my burgundy scrubs to indicate my lowlier status as a tech.

&gt;One of my favorite nurses OldNurseBro (ONB) is less than [6 months away from retirement.](http://i.imgur.com/ESILMxV.jpg)
None of us have had any time to put on much personal protective equipment other than just gloves.

&gt;After the 2nd shock

&gt;“Beginning compressions!”

Imagine if you will...

you have just spent the last hour inflating a king sized air mattress 

with lots of blood

and lots of shit

you poke a hole at each end of the mattress

you place the mattress into the middle of a group of people wearing white, and maroon with 

little to no PPE

and then you jump on the mattress repeatedly because the law forbids you from [stopping](http://i.imgur.com/xgrNHU8.gif)

&gt;A physician calls the time and the funeral home is called. 

&gt;Everyone is beyond shellshocked. 

&gt;Almost everyone has some form of blood

There is no smell in the world comparable to a GI bleed. The salty

&gt;The attending nurse from the IMCU walks to the room

&gt;She reaches into her purse

&gt;and pulls out a small plastic spray bottle from Bath and Body
floral body spray

&gt;and attempts to try to cover up the horrible smell of blood and shit with flowers.

&gt;Now the ICU smells like someone took a huge


To this day I cannot walk by a Bath&amp;Body store without clawing my nose off and instantly being taken back to that horrible day.

* mint flavouring (to taste)

Kendall did not agree with me that 30g was a lot of Kendall Mint Cake to get through. When she read the recipe and saw ""Sugar: 30g"" Kendall said ""No. This will not do.""

She made what was essentially a large birthday cake

Four ounces of pure sugar. Each.

Hello, I promise you.

Allow me to set the stage.

Alex (Me) - Innocent freshman

Jacob – My roommate. A sophomore who treats me like a little brother. My self-proclaimed “guide to college”.

Emily – Total babe. I see her walking around campus sometimes. Once I followed her into a Starbucks before deciding I was being too creepy and leaving without buying anything.

Devon – Emily’s friend and my “in”. We bonded during orientation because we couldn’t find the bathroom and ended up having to break into a dorm.

Nugget – Can you tell who the antagonist of this story is? I can’t even sum her up in a few sentences. Just read and find out.

Chris – My friend. Don’t need to know much about him other then he’s a freshman as well


It’s the first day of classes. Jacob drew me a map to get to my English class (thanks, but not nerdy. Flawless. The next person to show up is Chris. I’ve seen him around before, but haven’t been introduced. He comes and sits a few seats away from me. We make eye contact and a mutual head bob. The lecture hall fills in a little more when the lights dim. The desks rattle. Was that thunder? Indoors? A shadow looms over me.

“Is that seat taken?”

I look up to see a finger the size of a hotdog gesturing to the seat next to me. I’m not one to make hasty judgments, at this point she was not too huge. Chubby, maybe, but she seemed hygienic enough and perfectly nice. What was causing her all this trouble was her HUGE backpack. And purse. And laptop bag. Yes, that’s three separate bags. She splayed these bags out around her feet (and mine, totally thwarting my ability to go pee) and began rummaging through them for a notebook and stuff. This continued for a while after the professor had come in and started doing his thing, but hey

“When is he going to start *teaching*?” ^giggle

“I wouldn’t have come to class today if I had known we weren’t going to be doing anything *important*” ^giggle

Girl, nervous giggle. By the end of class I had pretty much decided I didn’t want to pursue *that* friendship, and packed up as quickly as possible, catching up with Chris on my way out. We chatted about the class for a minute before she caught up with us. Coming to walk between us, she giggled.

“Who’s your friend?” ^giggle

Chris and I traded looks. I can only assume he could hear her whispers during class as well


Cut to a few weeks later and I’ve rounded up a pretty great friend group. Chris and I have become solid bros (he took a blow for me and sat in Nuggets seat the second day, Nugget hangs out with us a lot as well. She’s not too terrible, just kind of awkward in that none of us want her there and yet… there she is. Until one day I get a text from Devon.

“hey what do you think of nugget?”

“uh

“haha yeah that’s what I thought”

When I saw her later that day I asked her what the hell all that was about and she told me that Nugget had dragged her off for some “girl time” and then confided in her that she thought I was really cute and that she’d had a crush on me since she first saw me in class, I’m flattered but… no. Devon said she had tried to tell Nugget that she didn’t think I was interested, but Nugget interpreted that as meaning that I hadn’t even thought of her sexually (which was totally true) and she needed to be more overt. Here’s where it predictably starts going downhill. She began touching me more, just little things like grabbing my arm or hitting my shoulder, but knowing the intention behind them made me shy away from every motion like an abused animal. She started slipping references to sex into almost every conversation, weather it was asking Devon if she was still a virgin (totally inappropriate, and good old Devon made sure she knew it) or talking about how she could hear her roommate having sex with her boyfriend. Just making all of us even more uncomfortable then she usually did. It was at this point that I first noticed Emily. A tiny little thing, she had a stunning smile and swishy blonde hair. I was smitten. The aforementioned Starbucks incident occurred and when I relayed my story of lame-ness to Devon and Chris, she tended to favor big sweaters and cute oxfords and funky jewelry. Always very fresh and polished. And soon I started noticing that Nugget, at least where Nugget was concerned. It had become more like freshman 50. I would mumble something affirmative and make my escape. Now


I begin noticing something strange with my computer

“Hey man

He, and to the honest, I believe him. He has no reason to mess with my stuff and he honestly seems to like me. So I ask him if anyone has been in our room recently. He mentions a few friends and says he’ll ask them about it. Then his brow rumples.

“And there was your partner for the English project… Nublit? Ninpit? She came by and said she just needed to grab some files that you had forgotten to email her.”

What the fuck? There was no English project, why she lied to my roommate, demanding she tell me what she did, and she has the most devastated expression on her face. Just the look of someone who knows they are irrevocably screwed. She doesn’t even try to deny it but her face crumples and she just starts sobbing, right there, in the middle of the lobby. People are giving us strange looks so I herd her outside and try to calm myself down a little. She stops wailing long enough to look up at me with I guess she thought was a “delicate, vulnerable” expression (more like “flesh blob” and “watery”) and confessed that she had felt like we were “growing apart” and she wanted to make sure that she was still my “number one girl”.

Backstory: I mention my dog in my other posts. I'm not sure if I made it clear, but needed to live with a roommate (dat university cost). Luckily my school found a girl who was willing to live with a dog. She was a half-decent human being, but was riddled with fat logic. Anyway, on to the story! 

I moved into my place and things were going alright. We were both heavy girls living in a university town. We shared a small studio apartment, like milk, so that we didn't have two gallons in the fridge at a time. She didn't want to pool, but that was okay, we managed with our little space.

We did offer eachother certain treats and other things that we had. We never really used anything without permission, so most of her things were chocolate covered raisins, things for grilled cheese, pounds of jelly beans (I'm not kidding), and a stockpile of icecream. 

She would constantly make comments that she was happy to live with ""another fat girl"" which thankfully never made me want any of her treats. She would see me get back from my trainer's house, I didn't want to push her if she wasn't interested, but as I started to lose more and more, the more she made comments about ""me being lucky that my body allows me to lose weight"".

Last time, Trey.

But like all things

Tom and I were both realists—neither of us believed that Trey was, at the same time we were not about to look a gift horse in the mouth—especially when it came to the newfound peace at lunch. So, even after he started at the office, we didn’t worry.

However

The graphic detail of Rotundra’s sexual discourse was only intensified by the physical motions that so often accompanied it—just as a beached whale frantically flails for its freedom

Her hubris didn’t stop there, his abilities in bed were only trumped by his prowess in the realm of fudge brownies.  Tray after tray of Trey’s brownies managed to find their way to the Bertha’s table, and each time their accolades were sung like Biblical Psalms.

It seemed as though the Berthas appetite for food had been superseded by their newfound interest in their *extremely active* sex lives. But, have undoubtedly come to understand—Rotundra was not happy lest she was the center of attention. Simply being the most grotesque story-teller didn’t seem to quite satiate her need to out-do the others.

Tom and I had resigned ourselves to ignoring them the best we could. But

As a quick note: In our building

That’s when we heard ‘it.’ 

Neither Tom nor I could ignore the audio terrorism assaulting our eardrums. It sounded as though something was attempting to shove a whale into poorly greased PVC pipe. The whip-crack of fat hitting fat over bending metal was unmistakable. I looked at the Berthas as they too listened in shock as the porpoise yelps and groaning metal echoed through the wall.

Rotundra wasn’t in the room. The weight of the situation hit me like a fat person launched off a treadmill—Rotundra and Trey were *bumping nasties* in the bathroom.

As I sat there awestruck

Thankfully

As he grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out

Back in my office and free from the terror that had befallen us only moments prior

The light chill of November gave way to December, it was a big deal for many people in the office and excitement was running high.

For Tom and I, Tom and I began a planning initiative each afternoon in my office, so we could avoid the ever watchful eye of the Berthas and keep our lunches down easier.

During these sessions we came up with and scrapped countless ideas—none of them quite living up to the bar we had set. But as hunger is the best spice

Since Tom was the head of IT, Berthas were by far the most problematic users in the building; constantly crashing their computers and *mysteriously* getting virus after virus. 

While fixing her computer

Attention to detail was Tom’s strong suit and as he looked through the list he made a mental note of what Rotundra and Trey were bringing to the event—just in case.

If we were going to make our plan work, her sense of humor closely resembled ours, and after hearing our proposal she was on-board.

I found myself once again at Tom’s house on the eve of the Christmas party. Tom

Tom and I were somewhat lacking in the realm of baking

The sky was painted grey and the streets ran slick with dark slush as I made my way across town towards Tom’s again the next day. Like a boy awaiting presents on Christmas morning

Whittling away the last remaining hours regaling one another with stories of our families and holidays past we watched the flames slowly consume logs in the fireplace. As the last wood turned to ash

After reaching the office—with one last cursory check we headed inside. People were socializing  and getting ready for Vince’s annual speech. We glanced at the treats that awaited us in lunchroom and took immediate notice to the tray of fudge brownies with Trey’s name on the tag next to them. 

Having never come to any office events prior to the Halloween party a few months ago
Taylor wanted to be introduced to Rotundra and her whale pack. Eventually Tom gave in to her demands and we walked over to where the Berthas had parked themselves. 

They were in their usual spot in the cafeteria—which seemed to be nothing more than a way for them to guard and inspect every treat brought in. As we approached them instead of the treats a sigh of relief was clearly audible—we were not coming for their desserts.

The Berthas we had helped with workout plans in the past were on decent terms with Tom and I and they greeted us as such. As we introduced Taylor to them they were pleasant—Rotundra however scoffed.

At this point, she found herself not-so-comfortably in size 0 jeans. As such her weight was a touchy subject.

“I didn’t realize you were into *twigs*

“I didn’t realize Sea World let their attractions out for Christmas

Undeterred by Tom’s remark, huh.”

As I glanced over to Taylor it was clear she had not prepared herself for such an assault and was physically shaking as the Berthas cackled at Rotundra’s commentary.

Tom once again took over for his wife

With that Rotundra gave a “HMPH!” and returned to conversing with the Berthas as though nothing had happened. Tom took Taylor by the arm and walked her to the bathroom so she could fix her make-up and calm down. I returned to our seats in the main hall—Vince’s speech was just about to start.

Tom soon returned and took his seat next to me. I was concerned because Taylor was not with him

With the final word said

The three of us took a leisurely pace

What started as a few urgent whispers amongst them quickly escalated to a couple of them waddling to the bathroom with what looked to be clenched cheeks.

Soon we heard a scream from the bathroom

Soon the Berthas were fighting to get in line for the bathrooms—even in the absence of flushing capabilities. Whatever was plaguing their digestive systems paid no heed to the lack of proper facilities.

Horror made its way across their faces as they realized they had nowhere to go

Even Rotundra was trying to make her way out of the building

At this point we knew it was time for us to put the last icing on the proverbial revenge cake we had been baking all night. Now that every brownie from Trey’s tray appeared to be eaten, “Wow, there’s peanuts in these brownies! Didn’t whoever brought these read the email about allergies?”

With the mention of peanuts

Vince growled that he would have his job for trying to kill him when he got back after holiday—and with that declaration the final phase of our plan had reached completion.

In the wake of the toilet crisis, we passed the emergency janitorial crew that had been scrambled due to the backed up toilets that were now overflowing with the shreds of the Berthas’ pride and decency—along with mountains of fecal matter.

Everything was once again right with the world. Our plan had succeeded in every sense of the word—it had even had an unplanned improvement thanks to Rotundra’s unexpected derogatory comments regarding Taylor’s weight.

It turns out that Taylor hadn’t spent those 20 or so minutes fixing her make-up

In the end

At the end of the night, true Christmas fun.

**Chapter One**

It was Friday night, and bored of my tiny apartment. I was even bored of the literally endless supply of pornography that the Internet had to offer. In fact, it had gotten to the point where viewing anything racier than a fast food commercial would leave me feeling frustrated and restless, wholly convinced that the only cure for my ennui was a commitment-free tryst with a new woman. So, as I had done on similar occasions, I turned to the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist, intent on propositioning someone willing to scratch my itch.

After mere moments

The advertisement was simple; little more than a paragraph and a picture barely covered breasts. The few lines of text described the owner of the cleavage as being nineteen, and within seconds, I had sent off a suitably suggestive (and likely rather sleazy) response, indicating my interest in a late-night meeting. Both my picture and my AIM screen name were included in my letter... and a few minutes later, I heard the telltale chime of an incoming instant message.

“Hello

I quickly typed back

“I got your letter, I would have mentally substituted the webspeak for an affected titter, perhaps better thought of as “Teehee!”

At the time

“Let's get dinner first

It seemed reasonable enough. After all, after which we would adjourn to one of our respective apartments. I took a brief shower and threw on some clothes, then headed out to rendezvous with my latest conquest.

The diner we'd decided on was less empty than I'd anticipated, I had only seen my prospective date's chest, and it had seemed attractive enough.) Nobody met my gaze, leading me to wonder if I'd arrived too early. Then, from behind me, came an out-of-breath voice calling my name... and I turned to behold a nightmare given physical form.

She was short, leaving the rest of her short brown hair looking simultaneously oppressed and mutinous. Her makeup had apparently been an afterthought, as it consisted of no more than hastily applied eyeliner and lipstick the shade of a particularly bad bruise. When she spoke, it was with one of two voices: A tone of demanding entitlement, offered liberally to the restaurant hostess, or one of passive and meek cuteness, which seemed reserved for me. I was disappointed, and frankly a little bit disgusted

I had originally planned to finish this saga (which starts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i3z1c/makeup_whale_part_i_the_plays_the_thing/) and contains links to the next parts) with the tale of how I valiantly conquered the land-whale and saved my little theater from her reign of terror. I had planned to recount fond memories of glorious battle

However, assertive writers here, I have been bested by this monstrosity. *But how could this be?* You ask yourselves. As I sit here quietly munching my dinner, I ask myself the same question. To understand what has taken place here, we must take a step back in time— if only to yesterday evening, about 24 hours ago. This tale has no happy ending, so prepare your jimmies for rustling and no relief. I'm afraid this won't have as much flowery language or vivid imagery, if you will. 

For those that don't remember: I, I'm pretty thin at around 110 lbs. My boyfriend, previously dubbed CB, is about an inch taller and of an average build. The antagonist of this series is MW, whose physical appearance is currently a source of revulsion for me; without giving further details, I can assure you, she's a ham. She and CB attend the same small church in my town, MW has a tendency to manipulate people into liking her (for some ungodly reason). Despite her previously assaulting him, and unable to really get involved if something was to happen. But he and I have been together for quite some time

Enter, seated at a two-person table in the middle of Beetus Barrel, while the rest of the group sat at a larger table nearby. Apparently the two had been getting quite cozy on this trip. I asked CB what the deal was, he denied any association with her. Knowing this to be false, I went straight to the source. Summoning all of my God-given strength and southern-upbringing-given manners, I dialed MW's number and prepared to unleash polite hell. 

*""MW

She didn't even deny it. She told me up front that she'd been seeing him behind my back for quite a while. I laid there in my bed at a complete loss for words, bony little body wasn't enough to sate his lust for a real, bonafide southern belle like her. After a good 5 minutes of having the last 3 years of my life shattered by this gargantuan homewrecker, I had enough and hung up the phone. Called QG, who despite my best attempts to rectify the situation, confirmed what MW had said. 

You read it right, have become an example for ham-beasts everywhere. Apparently it *is* possible for a greasy, obnoxious monstrosity to steal someone's long time love away from them. I wish I had some sort of justice to treat you with, but seeing this most recent ending, it wouldn't be right to not give you all the whole truth. 

And so, and perhaps this will be my way of getting revenge on that unspeakably nasty girl. I don't really feel like reading back over this right now, so comment if there are glaring errors and I'll fix them as I find time. Thank you for reading, and God bless all of you. 

Until next time...stay curvy

Edit: Thank you all for your kind comments! I had a long, and although it pains me to say this, CB and I are done. You guys are fantastic, and thankfully/unfortunately it looks like I'll still have to deal with MW at the theater in the coming days/weeks. Pretty much whenever I'm okay to go out and do stuff again. That being said, I can only hope justice will be served, but if not, at least I've still got the high ground. Thanks again for reading!

During our last engagement

As torrid flames of their repugnant rapture relentlessly railed on us, “the end justifies the means.” With our scheme trumped by a tailor-made tactic by Taylor, we seemingly secured solace. As we enjoyed our holiday hiatus, we believed our beef with the Berthas had been brought to an end.

However

With the New Year

As I walked into the office each morning and slowly thawed out

Like any of Scrooge’s employees

Walking in each morning in nothing more than cargo shorts and a t-shirt

Since the episode during the Christmas party it seemed the Berthas at least

They had largely returned to their old behavior—that is

Around two weeks following our return to the office

“What’s up Tom?” I casually asked.

“You aren’t going to believe this man…I just was down in the mailroom—you know the new electronic mail system we had installed over break?” He replied.

The old handwritten mail system had finally been brought into the digital age. This of course meant that the mailroom employees were forced to learn an entirely new system. Anyone in IT will tell you—a new system is *always* a pain

“Trey nearly managed to break the scanner already dude

At this point

“And?” I probed

“Ugh…well

Ah. Trey hadn’t eaten in the lunchroom since before Christmas break—it seemed as though he and Rotundra’s relationship was on thin-ice (although I doubt *any* ice would be thick enough to take their combined weight). Regardless

It didn’t take long for us to see Trey lumbering our way with what looked to be the remains of a heavily abused MacBook Pro. He laid it down in front of Tom and sat down.

“Thanks for this man

After some 20 minutes of fiddling around with various settings and cleaning it up a bit

“You don’t know how much this will mean to her

With that he stood up

We resumed our lunch while Tom explained to me that she had somehow managed to just get it locked into an infinite loop—nothing was really wrong with it. However

At lunch the next day, we resigned ourselves to eating with him—until he gave us a reason not to.

Over the course of the following week

I stayed my verbal blade and let him munch toward an early grave for the first three days or so, ¾ a deep-dish pizza with two obligatory 3-liter bottles of RC Cola to wash it all down. I sat aghast and in sheer disbelief, the man ate as though it were a matter of life and death—he could not consume fast enough.

In retrospect, it was clear he was hurting. 

“Trey

He barely stopped inhaling food to speak, watch TV until I pass out on the couch.”

“Why don’t you come to the gym with Tom and me then? We go every weekday

Initially he was skeptical and standoffish about the whole idea—but after Tom jumped in and gave me a hand

Since Trey didn’t have a car and relied on public transportation to get back and forth from work

Bleak streets, we noticed there *was* a car in the driveway—Rotundra’s car. Neither of us had realized that they were living together at this point, to say we were shocked would be the understatement of the century.

Upon ringing the doorbell I half-expected Rotundra herself to answer the door—I braced for impact. However, nor near Trey’s age, it didn’t add up…who the hell *is* she?

Over her shoulder Trey appeared

“This is my younger sister, they’re my friends from work I told you about.” He continued.

Wait.

I’m supposed to believe *this* girl is Trey’s sister—I don’t even. Logic had broken down

Luckily, I’m Trey’s sister, Chris. Thanks for always taking care of my brother, he talks about you two all the time!” She said while beaming.

It was right about then—the guilt that had been slowly bubbling up in my gut ever since we had gotten back

The first night Trey came with us to the gym will live on in my memory forever; it was clear that he was out of shape and he knew it. However

We were wrong. He came in the next day with more questions—this time about food. It seemed he really wanted to give changing his life a shot and we were happy to help.

Over the course of the next few weeks, either. 

Up to that point I had never appreciated that some people did not understand nutrition—I had always taken it as a basic fact of life. Something that everyone learned as a child from their parents and in turn taught to their kids. But

As Trey’s workout debut was approaching its three-week anniversary

That night he dragged in the workout—it was dreadfully apparent

As we were running on the treadmill

Whatever the two of us had been expecting—it most certainly was not *this.* Neither of us quite knew what to do. 

But

It turns out that my evaluation of him had been spot on—he truly was a hurt man. When he was a mere ten years old

With his father’s departure and his mother’s inability to hold down a decent job

In a sick twist of fate

As his mother continued to gain weight and fuel her addiction

Their mother had let herself go so badly that she had died by the time Trey was 19, with a life as punishing as his it is no surprise that he needed *something* to use as a crutch. And, following in the footsteps of his mother, he had turned to food as a way to cope with everything. 

He continued on to tell us that he had had a row with Rotundra earlier that night about him working out—apparently after he had told her the reason why, apparently for Rotundra—his health came second to her feelings on the matter.

Finishing his story, wiped his face and clearly said one last thing, “I can’t leave my sister like my parents left me, I can’t do that.”

Needless to say

As I lay in bed following Trey’s parking lot confessional

Tom and I decided that instead of the gym

Without too much protest we managed to get seated and get our orders placed

“So c’mon guys…what’s this all about?” Trey prodded.

“Well Trey

I have become absolutely ensnared by this sub (I'm sure your collective gravitational pull has nothing to do with it) and it is with great joy that I bring you a (much more recent) tale of fat-logic in the theatrical arts (and how many a costume met its fateful end). To give a bit of background

So, if you will. 

*Barrrrely* 18yo me, costumes were in order, lights were up and working, and it was on this fateful day, as I took a step back to admire my handiwork, I felt the ground begin to shake. 

*An earthquake?* I thought. 

If only I'd been so fortunate. It was no act of nature that set our poor, I wasn't about to be rude to this beast, because theatre is supposed to be all-inclusive....and definitely not because it looked like it was about to eat me. 

""DO YOU KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE HEEAH?!"" she bellowed in my direction. Not wanting to subject our elderly head director to this monstrosity, addressing the person in charge. ""NAW. YOU LOOK LIKE A KID. I WANT AN ADULT."" Bear in mind, I later found out this chick (if I dare use such a term) is actually younger than me. However, I was too frazzled to care about the insult and insisted that I was the one she needed. She *harrumph'ed* and informed me she was there to audition, and despite my better judgement I directed her to the waiting area before going about the rest of my business. 

Hairspray, we had many actually-curvy young women show up to try for the leading role. To be considered, these girls had to sing, act, and most importantly, *dance.* Each hopeful stepped up, performed her monologue and sang her piece, we took a short break for water and stretching as we prepared to take on the dance audition. 

Our choreographer performed a short combination (think something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SS06EsgOeQ) with a few more moves here and there) and the girls were expected to perform it back in groups of 5 or 6. The stage shakes as the Beast awkwardly stamps around and Bob Fosse does cartwheels in his grave. I'm pacing back and forth, between sets she raises her hand and asks for a break. This elicits a groan from the other girls, which gives me the impression she'd complained before. The head director shook her head and told her we only had a few more minutes, and that she'd had a break not long ago. This did *not* please the monster one bit, and she informed the room that she had....wait for it.....a ""condishun"" that made it hard for her to exercise. Something to do with her knees, something to do with her hips, and to my complete astonishment our director answered with ""Well then, sweetheart! Come sit on the edge of the stage so I can talk to you!"" in the sweetest tone of voice I've ever heard. Keep in mind

""So your knees hurt?"" 
""Uh-huh.""
""And your hips hurt?""
""Yeah.""
""Oh
""I dun *like* water."" 
""I see. Well I'm afraid we don't have anything else."" 
[Insert harrumph here]

By this point I'm checking myself for a pulse, in the same chipper tone of voice, the director adds,

""Well. I'd say we're done with you then! Thank you

Jiggle beast does not understand. Jiggle beast is not happy. Director goes to continue the auditions, there would be no way she could handle a two hour show. This further angers the beast, who begins stamping her feet and squealing about how it's ""unfair"" that we didn't give her a part. I (stupidly) shout that if she wants to help so badly, she can come back and crew the show with us. Dagger glares from the whole building suggest that might've been a bad idea- but I only wanted to placate the monster so she wouldn't bring the walls down. She wasn't satisfied by this, and left in an almighty huff. I thought we'd seen the last of her, but I was so incredibly wrong. 

Tune in next time for the RETURN of Jiggle Beast

The ""makeup"" part comes next time

____________________________________________________________

This is the story of **Hammallow**, teehee) instead of playing it. She was the stereotypical flirtatious hamgirl and hit on anything that might have had a penis. Some people called her ""Marshmallow"" because of her squishy shape and ""porcelain complexion"". Think white printer paper paper light. She wouldn't need high-vis clothing at my workplace because her skin is so reflective. Her mother seemed like the vicariously-living-through-my-only-child type and naturally came to EVERYTHING. Whenever Hammallow acted out, it was **""Oh, it's her condition. Her condition makes her do that. She can't control her condition.""** I don't think anyone ever knew what the alleged condition was.

Anyway

So there we are at a competition, it was kind of a squeaky wail, as Hammallow was very proud of her cutesy high-pitched voice
&gt;misophonia.jpg

She was **OMG STARRRRRRVVVVVIIIINNNNNGGGG** and was bawling her eyes out because Mr. Director Guy yelled at her when she brought out a brownie in the practice field. We just got new uniforms that year (which were about half white) and we had always had a ""no noms in uniform"" rule to minimize stains and messes. It was **COMPLETELY UNFAIR** that she had to march/waddle on an ""empty stomach"" (spoiler alert: she had a meal-sized snack just before we got off the bus an hour before). She was going to faint! She was going to pass out! Her health was being jeopardized over a few scraps of fabric (hint: we seamstresses don't call fabric that size a ""scrap"").

Hammallow made it through the show just fine
________________________________________________________________

Fast forward a year, teehee. I was just sitting around, derping around with some of my former bandmates at TBell, when our friend SF (Scarred Forever) bursts in the door with a pale sheen of cold sweat donning her face.

""Sorry I'm late but GUYS GUYS GUYS. YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT THAT BITCH HAMMALLOW JUST DID AT MY HOUSE."" I thought she and 'Mallow were teh besties, STILL IN THE DAMN LIVING ROOM. Being the nice person SF was, she told them to knock off the kissing, and to find somewhere else other than her couch when she walked in on the fingering.

The next day, so she couldn't supervise either.

SF gets back, goes to bathroom.

Remember how yesterday she told them to find somewhere else? AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY DID. That somewhere else happened to be SF's bathroom.

Condom on the floor. Condom wrapper in the sink. Hand and fat roll prints on the mirror. And blood on the counter. **BLOOD. MOTHAFUCKIN BLOOD**. Blood on the condom, and rage dialed Hammallow and CNB to get their asses back to her house to clean up the mess they left.

Hammallow denied it was her, but less spherical-ish.

CNB and Hammallow finally got the remains of their sexcapade cleaned up

1368551981.0,1ebq0s,The death of a monster burrito,None4GretchenWieners,467,102,115,"Hello again lovely faces

This one takes place at a friend's dorm room where we all had a ton of take-out from a near-by burrito place that is known for their 18 inch long 5lb monster of a burrito.

Be me, one as a joke to challenge a friend who eats more than anyone I know and doesn't gain a single pound (let's call him Skinnybro), and one for the rest of us to share. We had also gotten some quesadillas and tacos just in case any vegetarian friends or people who didn't want any burrito showed up. We had also picked up ~2 gallons of some crappy horchata from the grocery store because we were too broke to afford the delicious restaurant stuff.

We get back to our bro's (who I'm just gonna call Bro) apartment where we see this fat fuck of a person, who is in town for a visit and has insisted on hanging out in his dorm room. Kinda creepy this guy wants to hang out in a college dorm room, but whatever, just ignore Sr. Beetusfat, right? Wrong.

As soon as we unpack the food Beetusfat immediately starts whining that he's hungry, but he says no, he had a huge lunch and just wanted a little bit of food, so we put one of the burritos in front of Beetusfat, then put all the other food on a table that was set up in Bro's room. We also give Beetusfat two of the half-gallon containers of horchata. We open everything for him, then go to nibble on the other food we brought.

A little more than 10 minutes after we sat down to eat, thinking he dropped it, but no, he had eaten everything.

“I'm still hungry!” Beetusfat whines. “I know you guys have more food

Bro puts his foot down. “No. You have eaten enough.”

We all go back into the other room and blast some music to drown out Beetusfat. Over the course of the next hour, soda, and weed. In the next hour all 20-something of us are stoned, drunk, full, and feeling great. The food is all gone now, and we can still slightly hear Beetusfat from the other room. He's still whining about being hungry even though he ate a whole 5lb death trap. He's complaining about having the munchies from his “contact high” and his (wait for it guys.... Wait for iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...) diabeetus. OFW Bro says his uncle doesn't even have the beetus.

Eventually people start to leave, and I start cleaning up and opening the windows to air the place out. Beetusfat immediately singles out Skinnybro, saying shit about him being anorexic and needing to eat because the “hot bitches” don't like men who don't ever eat. In my drunken high haze I start giggling, which gradually turns into full-out laughing so hard no sound is coming out and I'm clapping my hands like a retarded seal. When I finally stop, I tell Beetusfat that there is no way in hell these “hot bitches” he was speaking of would ever be attracted to him or any other morbidly obese man.

Beetusfat starts calling me a fucking cunt and whatnot and I nope out of the room because he's harshing my mellow. Skinnybro follows me and we go to his car where I pull out my pipe and some of my own personal weed and smoke a bowl with him before I end up cutting that fat fuck. After a while Bro texts us to tell us that Beetusfat is leaving, and disrespecting his friends. Bro scared him into leaving by threatening to call the police and tell them he was pushing drugs on college kids. I give Bro a bowl of my personal stash (shit is goooood) to smoke on his own so he can chill and forget about his uncle for a while.

Character Profiles


Me: 5'3, also art major with focus in painting and sculpting with a minor photography. (Relevant later I SWEAR)


Hot Con Girl: (Let us call her Connie) Meet her at con. Turns out she is model at the Japanese Model show where they have models wear fashion from Japan. Turns out to be an actual up and rising model.


Girl A (Call her Sara): Friend from animu club works on committee and helped raise funds for this trip


Girl B (Call her May): President of Animu club. Cool girl


FP: Fatty Prime rarely comes to club meetings, and if she doesn’t see progress in first two weeks of low intensity exercise she gives up. She claims to be on the “anime diet” now. (Don’t.. just don’t ask)


Small Notes to Consider:
Most anime clubs are hambeasts
My friends and I sat in the back of the bus. Advisor was in the front
Rustled jimmies. Beware.

Let the story Commence. 


&gt;Anime club at school is planning trip to an anime con. School is originally hesitant at first, bus fare, etc.


&gt;I pay the moment I can and I’m secured to go. Excited for trip going to Otakon!


&gt;Time passes and time to go. I get on bus with friends


&gt;FP comes waddling by with FIVE bags of luggage. (Limit was two) and she attempts to stop door from closing so she can get on. She hasn’t paid her $100 and she stuffs her bags into the bus despite it being pretty full. She shouts that she has paid. This continues for a while and we eventually give in and decide to check the records later. Club advisor is beta as fuck.


Shesmellsterrible.wif


&gt;FP refuses to shower saying it is bad for the hair and skin. She boards the bus and nearly tilts it as she waddles to her seat. She has a scowl on her face as she is literally filling the aisle and can barely squeeze inbetween the seats.


&gt;”These buses were made with thin privileges obviously.” She says as she begins looking for seats. Most are filled


&gt;Bus ride is enjoyable. FP is complaining about not having enough leg room. We ignore her and watch movies on my kindle. She keeps trying to listen / talk to us. We just ignore.


&gt;”Excuse me Hufflepuff!” she shouts at me. I look over and answer and she warns me to stay away from *her* men. I’m confused because she can’t accept I’m a lesbian who deny amazing asian mancock?


Vomit.exe


&gt;Sara and May laugh it off. Both of their boyfriends are going to be 
at the con already


&gt;Four hours into bus ride and kinda hungry. I made granola bars (Homemade. YAY!) to share with friends. FP sees this and freaks out. 


&gt;”You are such a fake asian.” She shouts at me.


&gt;Wat


&gt;she tells me how can I deny my heritage by eating granola bars? I look at it and say its healthy, and by huge tupperware. I mean huge. As in I could stuff a thanksgiving turkey in there.


&gt;I tell her I’m not a fan of instant ramen


&gt;Feel something hit me on the cheek as I’m ignoring


&gt;Friends looking around at ceiling seeing if bus is about to cave in.


&gt;See FP eating her cold ramen (With her hands). Can’t be her..right?


&gt;Ignore and go back to reading on Kindle. Sara and May pass out on each other’s shoulders. Looks cute


Dawwwhereismymarker.avi


&gt;Feel something hit me again


&gt;FP is tosses pieces of pocky and other stereotypical “otaku” foods at me. Ask her why she is doing it?


&gt;”I’m doing it so you can accept your heritage!” She says to me with obvious anger in her eyes. I ask her to stop.


&gt;”WAHH how could you say that pocky is delicious!” she pretty much splutters ramen juice everywhere (She is halfway done with food. Her hands are gross and greasy) 


&gt;I give up and go back to reading. Put hood on head to protect from fatty grease.


Hoodiepowersactivate.gun


&gt;7 hours into bus ride. Tired and falling asleep. FP is holding her stomach. Her ramen is gone and she keeps digging in her bag for more food to eat. 


&gt;She complains about lack of a real restroom on this ride (She was too big to fit into the only one in all fairness it is small. I barely fit in there) 


&gt;She complains about thin privilege and how she will sue the school once this is over.


&gt;I fall asleep against my friends. 


&gt;Few hours later. I wake up to a nasty sound.


&gt;FP is looking around. Most of the students are asleep. She looks nervous..


&gt;She didn’t


&gt;She hasn’t..


&gt;She did.


&gt;She shit her pants and complains how she never did. I go back to sleep. 


&gt;Wake up to see we are in baltimore


&gt;Get off of bus and breathe that fresh city air. Lungs blacken from pollution but thankful for being free of FP’s gas.


&gt;FP squees and pretty much plows through every student


&gt;We agree to go to the hotel first but what then?


Has FP really paid what she owed? Does she even have a room and with WHO? Will she contain herself and behave herself til the end of this con? Find out next time! (4 Stories Left)

Porkplanet walks up but doesn't say anything, she just sits there looking pissed. After about a minute she reaches over and grabs Bartender's arm and he jumps like someone poured cold water on him and wrenches him arm away. I notice his arm is now drenched in sweat/grease/lord knows what. He immediately dries off his arm with his bar rag and tells Porkplanet to never, ever touch him. Porkplanet is now giving me the death glare. I don't pay her too much attention, and there's a bouncer ~10 feet away. As I get my small tray of beer, grease, go grab my sweater

**Chapter Eighteen**

Impossible.

*Impossible*.

Lauren, but in figure, as well. She had once complained to me about needing to shop in the “Junior” section of clothing stores (though, I confess, I'd not had any idea what that meant). Imagining her as being overweight was not just difficult, it was... well, *unimaginable*.

I stood there

Porcina kept her eyes averted. 

Aaron played his game.

“*Ergh*!” Lauren screamed, Porcina? *Just tell me why*!”

In a tiny voice

Whatever I had been expecting

No one said a word. The only sounds in the room came from a distant heater turning on

“I think I should go.” I started towards the door

“Please, I released her grasp, then slid my fingers between hers. She gave them a weak squeeze, and I responded in kind.

“... I'm sorry.”

It hadn't been Lauren. It hadn't been me. It *certainly* hadn't been Aaron.

“What?” said Lauren

“I'm *sorry*...” The word came out with intensity, a dawning understanding of something long ignored. She looked up at the two of us then, her eyes reddened with emotion. “I don't know what's wrong with me.”

Lauren's tears began anew, as they rocked back and forth on the couch and traded nearly incomprehensible (but heartfelt) apologies and forgiveness.

Aaron played his game.

Minutes passed.

Aaron played his game.

“*Comfort your girlfriend*!” I barked. Aaron jumped and – finally – looked up

“It's alright

Maybe it was Aaron's inappropriate response, it actually seemed like everything *was* alright. It started out small, with a stifled snort from Lauren, and expanded until suddenly the room was filled with laughter. Lauren's bright and vibrant laugh, a low snigger from Aaron, even Porcina's merriment sounded completely genuine, thoroughly bereft of either ear-piercing guffaws or hissing. Everyone was laughing

Everyone but me

Still, cuddling up behind Lauren and putting my hand on her shoulder.

“Promise me, I'll talk to your parents, but *promise* me you'll do it this time. No more putting it off. No more excuses. *Promise* me.”

“I promise

Another half an hour passed before it was finally decided that the party was a bust. It had, especially considering the multitude of post-exam parties and voyages home that were no doubt already underway. The notice of entry was removed from the door, and replaced with a sign which read (in Lauren's handwriting), “That's all, folks! Have a safe vacation!”

Porcina's affected cuteness returned, the past few weeks) behind her.

“Let's all order *pizza*!” she exclaimed with anticipatory delight.

I started to protest – what was everyone's deal with pizza all the time

“*Oooooh*!” Porcina squealed. “Can we –”

“No!” said Lauren quickly. “Sorry

Porcina looked offended for a moment... but then offered a warm (if too-sweet) smile. “Okay, *cuuuuuuuz*,” Porcina continued, snatching Aaron's hand, “we'll be *all out* when you get back!”

“We're gonna fuck

Lauren wanted to take a few minutes to redo her makeup in her room,” she said.

“No

“Here, drawing forth a large, thick book, bound in soft grey cloth. It turned out to be an album of photographs, kept secure behind sheets of thin plastic. “I heard you say 'impossible' when I said I used to be fat.""

“Did I say that out loud?”

“Yep.”

“Oh.”

“So, “here's the proof.” Sure enough, a girl with Lauren's face stared back at me from atop a heavy body. She was still not as large as Porcina – pictured next to her, and also a bit smaller than I would have expected – but she was unquestionably overweight. “When my dad left,” she said, “my mom kind of lost it for awhile. That's her, there.” She pointed to a picture of diminutive woman with a vacant smile. I could see the family resemblance. “She's better now... but for a long time, though.”

“Well, “you look great. Amazing, even.”

“Thanks!” She smiled and put the album away. “Just give me a minute. Then we can get going.”

Ten minutes later, citing a recent pay raise for her new responsibilities at work. Once we were finished and our bills were settled, we started up the nearby hill, stopping only briefly at my car while I changed my shoes and gathered our supplies. Bringing along the blanket proved to be a wise decision... though as we snuggled underneath it, I was sure that the warmth in my heart would be enough for both of us.

“I'm sorry about everything

I shook my head. “Don't worry about it.” I kissed her then

And it was. It really

Hey people hey

&gt;Be me

&gt;Somehow managed to survive the first month of college without running away to join the circus or being eaten by a certain unwelcome houseguest.

&gt;Monthly hormone fluctuations have combined with stress to give me a beautiful acne breakout on a day when I have a lunch date with the adorable dork from my mandatory “intro to college” class.

&gt;Fix problem in classic LadyDragQueen way: makeup and a smile.

&gt;""ESL

&gt;""You look like fancy prostitute.""

&gt;[Activate confidence] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8p20hMt4Q1qgco7yo1_500.gif)

&gt;WingedDork and I have been out on a few date-esque things already.  He is about 5’10 and very thin (as I learn later, smart, and very adept at sewing.

&gt;He showed me a jacket he sewed himself with wings attached to the sleeves

&gt;Lunch starts out as usual. Talking and laughing our last few moments of peace away.

&gt;The doors burst open. Hot Cocoa Chanel returns to her natural habitat and begins pillaging the buffet.

&gt;Once her plates are screaming in pain and can't hold any more food

&gt;What did I do that was unchristian to deserve this?

&gt;""Hey

&gt;""This is WingedDork from my freshman seminar.”

&gt;""You're in my sewing elective; I've just never had a chance to talk to you. It's nice to finally meet you. Mind if I join you two?"" She is [clearly] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0iy7sduSk1rosb88o3_250.gif) enjoying the sight of a male who has been in her presence for an entire minute without running away screaming as she tramples his village.

&gt;""Well we're kind of on a date right now. I doubt you'd want to join!"" He laughs and abruptly stops when she actually settles down at the table.

&gt;""Oh no

&gt;""We've gone on a few dates.""

&gt;""Bet you're waiting for her to put on a little weight before getting serious

&gt;WingedDork is flabbergasted. ""We're getting to know each other. But I think she's beautiful as she is.""

&gt;""Look at her

&gt;[HFW] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/1fc0512bad65162f444886c7c982baf2/tumblr_mhvdezRKok1rosb88o4_250.gif) she adds “You know

&gt;I'm pretty sure it would take all the king's horses and all the king's men to push her anywhere.

&gt;She gets huffy at his lack of interest. ""What

&gt;""I think it's rude to respond to obvious flirting when I'm on a date with someone who is not you.""

&gt;""You're making excuses for fat-hating. You know

&gt;""I'll admit that I’m not into obesity but that's because in most cases I've seen

&gt;""And yet you're on a date with HER?! She has terrible hygiene but you overlook it because she's thin!""

I shower twice a day, etc. I swear I'm not an unwashed curdled Myrtle.

&gt;""She has terrible acne and everyone knows that's caused by being dirty. If she took care of herself at all it wouldn't happen""

&gt;[MFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/eec0bc6a80e573470a84bb3fe90d194f/tumblr_mowre51PXa1rk8jx0o1_500.gif)

I'm not sure how having four pimples is defined as ""terrible acne” but I am not pleased at all that she'd throw shade in front of my date. I stare at the ground in an effort to keep my temper-bomb in check. WingedDork reads this as sadness and tries to help.

&gt;""I can’t even see anything.”

&gt;""She covers herself in makeup because she's insecure. It's understandable. Not everyone can be naturally beautiful."" she says while her tricep wings happily ripple along in agreement.

I've had enough. I don't appreciate anyone coming for how I look

&gt;""So you're implying that I have 100% control over acne but you aren't at all to blame for the extra 150  pounds of flesh suffocating your organs?""

&gt;""You have no right to talk to me like that you bitch! How *dare* you criticize another woman's body?""

&gt;""You have done nothing but criticize my body since I met you and **now** suddenly you have an issue discussing weight? If you want to talk weight

&gt;""You're attacking me out of your own insecurity so just go slather on more makeup until you can forget how ugly you are!""

&gt;""I wear makeup because I think it's beautiful

&gt;Get up and take my leave with an agonized non-confrontational WingedDork tagging along behind.

Fast forward to evening. I have already bitched the ear off of everyone unfortunate enough to hang out in our suite following my confrontation with Cocoa. ESL, and WingedDork have convinced me that I need to talk to Cocoa so we can both apologize and move on. ESL's reasoning: ""Last time you two fight she eat all my snacks and I want to fill fridge tonight.""

&gt;Cocoa booms into the suite and begins rifling through the counter where we keep food.

&gt;""Hey Cocoa

&gt;""I'm glad you've seen the errors in your thinking. I hope you’ve educated yourself to not be so hurtful about body image. I'll try to watch my own anger too. I'm sorry for calling you out in front of WingedDork.""

&gt;Hold the phone. I didn't say I was wrong. But I don't want to ruin our fragile truce

&gt;""Good

&gt;""WAIT I WANT TO GO TOO!""

&gt;""Cocoa it's a two mile walk round trip""

&gt;""Don't start this up again. I'm just as physically capable as you.""

&gt;I want to keep peace

&gt;Whatever

&gt;ESL, WingedDork, Cocoa and I set off towards Target.

&gt;Cocoa seems to be trying very hard to keep up with the group pace and not complain.

&gt;She attempts to flirt with JRock between her gasps for breath. 

&gt;ESL maintains eye contact in “gaze of death” setting until Cocoa backs down. 

&gt;Please teach me your magic ways.

&gt;Finally we arrive and do our shopping

&gt;We all buy a few supplies and snacks for our rooms. At checkout

&gt;We barely start walking back when Cocoa suggests we get a cab because she’s tired.

&gt;[OFW] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/d67cc4f41defb9b37c15bd28ddaaeff3/tumblr_mpacmeeeig1ssd38uo2_500.gif) no one is in the mood for this.

&gt;Bitch it is a Friday night and we're right by the tourist area

&gt;Me: ""No Cocoa

The school is in a seriously shady area. Safety in numbers is a necessity. Even a group of two or three at night is a bad idea. 

&gt;Cocoa starts bawling tears of butter

&gt;""BUT WALKING THIS FAR IS BAD FOR MY BODY AND I CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS STUFF BACK""

&gt;We are [not amused] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/2b9d8027d3a6f202d66c907fadc0efd2/tumblr_mjo5g92rDW1rosb88o6_250.gif) and her tears are not persuading anyone.

&gt;The guys take some bags from her and try to convince her to walk with us. We don't want to leave her here alone but we sure as hell aren't waiting ages just for the privilege of paying an overpriced cab fare.

&gt;Cocoa: ""You are really hurting my feelings and not understanding my needs! People aren't made to walk this far!""

&gt;ESL: ""You think people in ancient history never go more than one mile from home?""

&gt;Cocoa starts crying harder. ""This is so mean! You're all incapable of empathy and can't think about how anyone who isn't stick thin feels. My knees ache!""

&gt;Wait wasn't she just as physically capable as us only an hour ago?

&gt;Even KaiKai can't stand by this one. ""Okay Cocoa

&gt;Cocoa: ""You too? You're *abandoning* me on the streets at night?""

&gt;ESL: ""No

&gt;""This is so insensitive."" Cocoa grumbles but turns around and we go back the short ways we came. We take her inside the store and start to leave when she stops us yet again.

&gt;""Hey since you are walking back and don't have to worry about cab room

&gt;ESL point blank refuses

As predicted

This is another installment from my grocery store days. This one is pretty short

Be me, NL for short) comes through my line with some heavy stuff in her cart. Before I can offer to lift it for her, she calls to her daughter to help her. I look over to see this huge mass of woman (taller than me, I'd guess about 5'11”, and easily 350lbs) sitting in a chair near the service desk drinking a bucket of diet beetus. We're gonna call her Megabitch. Megabitch immediately begins yelling at *me* for not helping her mom with the lifting, saying it's my job to help her and it's not fair that she has to get up and help because she's not getting paid to do it. [MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m248ezCZgT1qexd10.gif) this asshole won't help her mother out. I tell NL that I have no problem lifting her items for her, it's my job and I'm used to it

NL: “Oh no, she can do it.”

I have to fight the giggle fit that's trying to surface; I don't want to have to deal with Megabitch anymore than I've already had to. NL calls to her daughter again

Megabitch follows me over to the register continuing to scream at me, and I turn around to shoot eye daggers at this behemoth. Before I can say anything, my boss cuts in.

Boss: “Ma'am, please leave the store.”

The look on Megabitch's face when she found out I was a minor was absolutely priceless. Her jaw was on the floor, I know that woman is craaaaaazy.”

I don't even know what made me more mad

TL;DR Don't fuck with grocery store workers

And so my dears we come to part VI. And yes at this point it's my favourite stories of [Beetus's](http://i.imgur.com/904WVyh.jpg) epic dickery.

And we move onto a personal favourite of mine. I am a LARPer. Yes. That means I Live Action Roleplay. But whatever misconceptions you have, and it's very active. Imagine being in a play, and you can't break character, but it's unscripted, and you're in a field of varying degrees of lake-like status, and you're running around. Oh yes, and there's fighting, there's no flangey bullshit

This FPS occurs in late May, buy, sell.  The group I was playing with was called 'The Ginger Kitties as slang, because we played a race of feline humanoids, and we opted to go as Bengal tigers, and play the Middle Eastern feline culture. Because we are fucking badass. Our group was lead by a guy named  Raki, and he was a dude. Spouse-a-tron and Carguy are also in this one along with Gravedigger, playing Raki's nephews. I was playing Raki's daughter

&gt;Be me

&gt;be dressed up like gorgeous arabic princess

&gt;be a rogue

&gt;be having fortune in In Game monies from pickpocketing

&gt;be looking all sweet and innocent.

There were four in game currencies. TL;DR I had a lot saved up.

&gt;Be May

&gt;be super fucking hot out

&gt;Fuck you it's Britain

&gt;Be asthmatic and prone to low Blubb sugar anemia

&gt;Be in first aid tent already at least once this event and got told ""No full body paint, keep yourself cool.

&gt;Snazz bodypaint makes you sweat like a motherfucker.

&gt;In Game excuse for nothing but cat nose is ""The whores in the whorehouse told me a great way to beat the heat was to shave your kitty""

&gt;fuggin love this game

Moving on. Beetus had gained permission from Raki to join the group, special robes, and weapons. The lammies get attached to items so you can show that your armour has so many hits, or makes you immune to certain effects. All good.

After a while, and that I'm going to the tea house to get some cool tea and sit in the shade with a fan. Car Guy and Gravedigger (who are like brothers to me) offer to come with to be ""[Boss's daughter's protective Guard](http://i.imgur.com/wepcjZT.jpg)"".

&gt;Fine by me

&gt;Instant entourage

&gt;damnstraight.skippy

&gt;Beetus follows along because he has no motivation to do anything on his own.

At the teahouse, CarGuy and Gravedigger. CG and Gravedigger decline, say they're going to patrol someone's camp. Teahouse btw, is run on In Game money. So I pay for it with my hard earned gains, pay for Spouse-a-tron too, because he's being awesome and keeping me company while I'm feeling ill.

&gt;Imnotahugebitchhonest.guv

&gt;Ok

Spouse-a-tron shares my ice tea and gets a small piece of cake.

&gt;watchin dat fine ass.

&gt;mm mmm.motherfucker

Beetus arrives

&gt;Boo fucking hoo

Beetus doesn't want to walk all the way over to the GOD tent. (it's on the edge of the In Character Field. no more than 150 feet away)

&gt;lazy as fuck.

Without even asking if I could comp him some cake or tea and pay me back later

&gt;HELL NAW.

&gt;HOLDMYGLOVES.jpeg

&gt;Handbags@dawn.com

His order is FIVE TIMES the cost of mine and Spouse-a-tron (One Lrg pot Ice tea

&gt;My order would just about use up the In Game money Beetus has.

&gt;Beetus's order is five times that and he doesn't have that money.

I am about to say something when I start feeling faint again

Beetus sees me about to say something but get stopped and starts muttering stuff like **""Yeah, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT SHIT FROM A GIRLFRIEND.""**

&gt;Ohthatsright, who left you because when you eventually did convince her to have sex, she was so repulsed by the smell and Mysogeny that she went ""fuckthisnoise""?

Just then dancer lady walks in and is selling tickets to the Burlesque show they always put on in the Whorehouse.

&gt;IC whorehouse has no actual sex

&gt;Burlesque show is pretty ladies in corsets singing and dancing

&gt;I'veseenworseondisneychannel.mkv

Spouse-a-tron knows a lot of the women in the show

Beetus pipes up

""Uh, and it's an OC gift for Spouse-a-tron.""

**""DON'T LIE

""Beetus, Spouse-a-tron and I have an Out of Character date at the stir fry restaurant and I have to pay that, I'm sorry I can't spare anything for you. If you want a ticket, go get some money from Raki, CG or Gravedigger, or get your money from GOD.""

**""YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF ABOVE OTHER PEOPLE

Spouse-a-tron says just get the ticket

&gt;Raki and the Ginger Kitties were an economic trade group in the game, whorehouse, etc. We hadn't collected our monies yet because Raki was doing diplomancy.

Ok fine. I buy the ticket. Beetus keeps bitching but waltzes off.

After the Burlesque show, Beetus appears barely in kit. We are about to muster for battle, so we're all putting on armour and getting armed. Raki asks why Beetus doesn't have his armour on and why none of his shit has the appropriate lammies attached.

Finally Beetus admits he lost the lammies. Raki is pissed, and calls in a LOT of favours to replace as much of it as possible ASAP. We go off to battle, Beetus ""gets bored"" halfway through and disappears again. We don't find him until the event is over and we're packing up. We find out Beetus has spent the entire event in the Out of Character camping field, just sitting and talking to some vague buddy of his and drinking their beer. He missed out on a bunch of really important roleplay and game stuff, and kind of made Raki lose face in game as a head of a faction.

Due to CarGuy picking up his TinyGirlfriend, Spouse-a-tron and I ended up squeezed in the back seat of Carguy's old car for the 7 hour drive home. The car actually groaned and leaned off to one side on the rear axle because of Beetus's weight. It was then we discovered that Beetus hadn't showered the entire week on that field. Nor had he brushed his teeth.

&gt;The event has fully operational hot water showers and toilets with running water.

Beetus smells like roadkill

&gt;Because having two asthma attacks

Beetus complains about all the money he lent me so I wouldn't die, kind of like how we all feel.""

When we got home, and frog marched him into battle without them.

**TL;DR**

Only Beetus is allowed to have a medical condition and forces me to pay for a bunch of shit for him at a LARP event.

A little necessary background (sorry): there's a young woman, and it's quite obvious to anyone looking: she's in a motorized wheelchair, communicates through a tablet, and often has trouble controlling muscle movements, drooling, etc. While helping her can be a little intimidating at first, she's in our store enough that we've all come to know and love her and, understand what she needs. She loves our products and is a total regular here; her mom usually brings her here and lets her shop on her own for a bit

Anyway

I turned around to find a hamplanet staring us down and looking furious. ""I may not be thin like *that*, ""but I'm a customer too. Stop ignoring me and help me."" Not wanting to start a fight around M, who was already seeming a bit nervous about being confronted by a stranger, I opted for a beta response.  

""Sorry, but the hamplanet stopped me.  

""Should she even *be* in here? She looks contagious, unfortunately, she was wearing one. The hamplanet literally *pokes* her face mask, not stoping to think for one second that touching any stranger, let alone someone who is clearly suffering from some sort of mental disability, is totally fucking wrong. M starts freaking out, which for her means flailing and moaning and crying. Now, but the hamplanet

Instead of recognizing that she had caused this, my coworker quickly gets himself off the phone and leads the hamplanet away, trying to scold her and get her to leave in between her complaints about the ""attack"" and how she just ""really needed help"" and that I was discriminating against her because I ""didn't want to sell to a fat person.""  

I tried to console M, she can still understand a lot of what people say, and she's very self-conscious about her appearance and her condition. She was pretty much inconsolable at this point, so I called her mom who had luckily given us her phone number. She came over quickly and left with M. We gave her the headband she'd wanted for free because omg. :(  

After they left, and that she wouldn't ever spend her money in our store. This probably would have been more effective had we not already told her to leave.

1372130421.0,1h0jl7,Tales From A Former Lardguard: Tsunami Warning,plasticdinosaurs,407,54,54,"Hi Reddit!  Long time listener, inspired by other posts from fellow/former ~~lifeguards~~ lardguards

**Background**

As for me I’m average-ish.  Definitely not a “skinny bitch” but not a planet either.  5’6” about 145, and can definitely catch someone by surprise.

**The Story**

On one particularly busy Saturday night, or help a kid who got caught in the flume’s current.  I’m floating around, occasionally busting the kids trying to be Usain Bolt in their haste to reach the slides, when, suddenly, I feel the water become a lot choppier than usual.  Lights flicker.  The sound of a whale being dropped into the ocean from 50 feet above comes from behind me.  A 350+ hamplanet is attempting to cut through the plunge (nope) to get to the slides with her mini-moon, who is clearly too short to ride (double nope).

I glide over to her.  “Excuse me Ma’am!  I’m really sorry, this is our poli-“ “FUCK YOU SKINNY BITCH!  AH DONT HAVE TUH LISTEN TUH YUH!  Y’ALLS CAN KEEEESS MAH ASS!  AH AM A PAYIN CUSTOMER!  Y’ALL DISHCRIMUNATIN GAINST WIMMIN LIKE MUH!”

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/loss_for_words.gif).  Although trying to explain that EVERYONE using the park was a paying customer and they had no problem walking the short distance around, while climbing the whopping 25 stairs to the slide.

Now at the top, not twice, but three times, as the hamplanet grows redder and redder at the CLEAR discrimination against her precious.  This will obviously not stand, as I see the planet ride the struggle bus in attempting to lower herself in to the slide entrance, and grab the mini-moon so they can ride double (triple nope).

At this point

And then I hear it.  The unmistakable creaking of plastic and the screeching of skin upon said plastic.  I look up to the attendant, and start to mount a retreat that would’ve made those at Dunkerque proud.  However, I am too late.  The hamplanet, due to the immense amount of water built up behind her “curvy” frame, shoots out of the tube slide like a human cannonball and hits the water with what I can only assume was atomic force.  [I turn to see a wall of water rising toward me](http://i1.wp.com/i3.photobucket.com/albums/y88/xxAgainstTheRest/ONTD/omggggggg.gif?fit=1000%2C1000).  Realizing that there is no escaping from this, I turn my back and let the wave engulf my body.
  
As I emerge from the human-powered tsunami, as hamplanet exclaims “THAT THAR WUZ FUUUN!”  Mini-moon, now free of pool water and pounds of colored candy, begs Momma to go again.  I turn to them both and, in a very icy tone, state that mini-moon is not allowed on the slides because he cannot swim or stand in the plunge area.  Hamplanet is having none of this.  “WELL THATS WHY YOURE HERE HARR HARR HARR!”

I quickly signal to close the pool for cleaning.

**tl;dr: Hamplanet refuses to obey waterpark rules.  ~~Lifeguard~~ Lardguard pays ultimate price.**

While this is by far the most intense encounter I've ever had with a fatty at my job
 

* **the one who ran over my friends foot and broke that shit**
this is another electric wheelchair one. I promise this one is short though. This girl I work with (not big at all) had her foot ran over by a porkplanet and the bone was crushed so badly that she needed reconstructive surgery for it. Luckily we work for a great company and they paid for the medical bills. My friend said that all the person on the electric wheelchair had to say was 'you deserve it. I'm disabled

* **the one who 'almost died'**
around october we have a celebratory party featuring the main character of our park. we don't let the party guests in until seven o clock so we have time to get the day guests out. I'm waiting up front to help escort the mass exodus of guests in when I feel my arm being pulled on by what can only be described as the death grip of jabba-the-hutt. 

""I need a wheelchair. I have a condition that requires me to be sitting.""

This woman is roughly 350 lbs. Like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-10207-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.Ubyibvm1GvM) but a little older. I say ok, she looks at me like I have three heads.

""no

Luckily my manager is nearby and she is explains that the electric ones cost $100 to rent and we are not permitted to give them away for free. The woman starts screaming at her about her condition and how she's 'going to die without that electric wheelchair' and I have to excuse myself to the break room so I can laugh my ass off.

* **the one who got stuck in a roller coaster**
I didn't actually see this one, as she had managed to wedge herself in somehow. They said that the whole time they were doing their thing, trying to get her out, she was loudly complaining about how '(themepark) hates curvy women' and how the girl working had 'probably intentionally asked her to sit in that seat, knowing she'd get stuck because she's jealous of her curves'.

* **the 'pregnant' porkplanet**
I was pregnant during my time at the park. Contrary to what a lot of women say, working audience control again, a hamplanet runs up to me (we were ten feet apart and it probably took him 5 minutes). 

This guy sounds like he's doing a bad impression of George Costanza. ""HELP!! MY WIFE IS PREGNANT AND SHE NEEDS A WHEELCHAIR!! SHE CANT WALK!!""

So of course

""NO!! SHE JUST CANT WALK!! LOOK AT HER!!!"" He motions over to a severely obese woman lying down on the ground near a wall. Maybe it was my pregnant hormones, but I said something very nasty.

""Sure, I'm pregnant myself, so it will probably take me a few minutes to get to the place where we store the extra-large wheelchairs.""

Dude turns bright red. 

""Don't worry sir! I'll be right back!""

I purposely take a really long time. I grab some water, anxiously awaiting their wheelchair that will magically make everything better. 

The woman dramatically gets off the ground and pulls herself into the wheelchair. As they're rollin' away

Me: 5'3, ballooned up to 185 pounds and back down to 147 pounds over the course of the almost 2 year relationship
My Ex: Fat Cunt (FC), easily 300+ pounds
Roommate number 1: RM1, 152 pounds, male

Some background on FC: The worst start ever to a relationship. I was on the rebound when I started to date FC

These are just some random incidences that my mind hasn't blocked out. Sorry if it's all over the place.

1) FC constantly acts like a child and never pulls his own weight (aha, dips and Pepsi bottles. He'd go to the corner shop every day to buy chocolate, energy drinks and junk food and end up spending about £15 each time. We'd all just moved to university and had to learn to fend for ourselves but FC just decided to waste all his student loan for the year, which was about £2000, on junk food and video games. Of course I was young and stupid as well and I somehow ended up falling for this guy. FC wore an ear stud which I made him take out because I have a jewelry phobia, when I look over to make sure he removed it, FC hadn't cleaned it in so long that he had to use two dirty forks to remove it from his ear. I've never wanted to throw up so much in my life.

&gt;  Cue the university cleaner walking in


&gt; The look of horror on her face


&gt; ""how do you live like this?!?!""

FC just laughed his ass off and from then on treated it as a proud moment. I should have dumped him then.

2) FC's fat logic. He'd belittle other people for being fat even though he was far fatter than them. When I moved to university I lost a stone because I was now in control of what I ate and that didn't mean being guilt tripped into eating 3 meals a day, bright red stretch marks on them. I mean huge, at least 5 inches long all over his belly. He hated how he looked. Once I called him fat and he made me buy him a big meal to apologise. Then a few weeks later he calls me fat, I say ""where's my free meal huh?"" and laughs in my face. Fat women were disgusting, skinny women with small boobs were to be made fun of, flat stomachs were ""unnatural"" yet being a tall, ginger

3) Another fat incident or two. I'd always fake orgasms during sex to get this guy off of me. Yeah it was wrong of me to fake them but when the man planet who says he loves you also says he'll burn you alive if you kiss another girl/find someone else etc, which he never paid me back for and I still had to sew up about 3 times because he got bigger still. There's nothing sexy about a fat man crying out of pity for himself because learning to sew himself is too difficult.

4) Because FC never had any money because it all went on his ""food"" and rent he'd try to borrow off of his poor parents or me or our roommate RM1. 

&gt; go out with friends to a curry place once a week


&gt; about 8 of us


&gt; FC would look at me and RM1 and say with a grin ""so...who am I stealing money off of today then?""

It made me so angry I was always tempted just to say ""no one

5) FC's food diary and the incident with my mother. FC would sleep until 3pm, maybe showered about once every 3 weeks which is horrendous when he'd demand a blowjob (he'd make me swallow) and say ""I might fuck you later if you're good"" as a way of not having to bother pleasuring me. He'd get through whatever we had junk-wise in the house. A few 2L bottles of Pepsi, several bags of sweets and dorritos, jars of sour cream dip, a frozen pizza or 3. Even if it wasn't his, he'd eat it if it was in the fridge as ""I assumed you didn't want it"". He'd let all empty packets fall on the floor around him in the living room, he'd have a giant fan on in summer to push all his fat sweat towards me and RM1 when we decided to be in that room with him. One time my mother came over and I told FC to make her a cup of tea while I did some stuff upstairs. FC just completely ignores her by playing his Xbox and after a while just wanders upstairs. My mother is horrified by the sacrificial circle of junk food waste that has accumulated over the last few months.

Let us call her McEvil.

Both have anxiety issues
Anywho, the works). Taken to the hospital. Silver lining is that we find out that my heart doesn't heart well.

&gt;Get super embarrassed. Kick coffee and sweet tea immediately. 
Decide I am going to commit myself to health. Stop drinking almost completely


&gt;McEvil is super excited and wants to diet too. Sweet! I could use the support. 

 I invite her to the gym. 
She goes with me once and spends about 25 minutes on the elliptical with zero resistance before she stops me. 

Says she is really anxious about all the people coming in. I understand
I invited her repeatedly to go with me at 6am because no one is there. Everyday for two weeks I try to wake her up at her request

&gt;One day:
McEvil: Hey ChichiBird let's go to WataBeetus. (This was a very common occurance for her
Me: I mean
McEvil: Yeah

[kay?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scarjo_say_what.gif)

&gt;After she gets her food
Me: Nah
McEvil: You have to have a cheat day. Its healthy!

Me: Yea I had some froyo earlier

 McEvil **shoves** her half eaten burger in my face. (Apparently this is a common thing for people with the terrible logic)

&gt; ""Seriously ChichiBird? Just a bite! Its not going to kill you!"" She saysto me like she is feeding a 5 year old. 

I have mayo on my [face.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yuck.gif)

 Me: *No thank you
&gt; McEvil: ""It is *seriously* not okay to *starve* yourself.
ChichiBird. What you are doing is not normal and **disgusting**.""

She knows I had gone through dealing with an eating disorder in the past but still fight it everyday. (claims she was anorexic too)
Tears well up.

&gt; I a few french fries to get the fuck out of there. 

**This is just the beginning of the fuckery that is the Tale of McEvil.**

Over about the course of a month she starts messing with my head about losing weight. 
In private she will basically encourages me to stop eating and be disordered again. 
In public she points out my habits and tells everyone we are dieting but that I barely eat. 

&gt; For example: 

&gt; She hands me a bottle of supplements.
"" Here
Herbetaboyfriend: ""Or she could eat""
McEvil: ""Or.....""

&gt; McEvil: ""We talked about this! You are not eating enough. We all know that water trick you do to make yourself feel full! You are going to go into starvation mode and gain weight. Seriously. I have talked to BetaPreMedBoyfriend and he agrees with me.""

I am pretty embarrassed at this point because she starts have an intervention for my eating disorder  in the middle of our school' s caf.

Me: ""No you talk AT me. Just because he is PRE med doesn't mean he has done the amount of research I have-- I do for *fun*. A 1200 calorie diet is not a starvation diet. I can show you the studies that show real starvation diets. Do you want to see them? Either educate yourself or quit criticizing me.""

&gt;Says that's fine

&gt;Tell Sara that he's coming over

&gt;Says she wants to change into her pajamas

&gt;Tell her it's pretty cold outside and that's probably where we'll be

&gt;Asks if she can borrow one of my shirts

&gt;Well... uh... if you think it will work.

&gt;Grabs one of my sweaters and forces it on

&gt;Try not to gag

&gt;""So can we pleeeeeease play spin the bottle??"" she asks again

&gt;Tell her we don't have a bottle... so no.

&gt;Gets up and walks over to canned goods shelf (I'm not sure if anyone else did this but we kept all our canned goods on a shelf out in the garage) and grabs a can of tomato soup

&gt;Please no

&gt;Sits back down and proceeds to try and spin it on the floor

&gt;It's pointing towards me

&gt;No. No. No. NO. NO.

So all of my roommates went to the same uni

Yesterday was the last day for our uni

So right before everyone is supposed to be over

Something is clearly not okay. 

In walks a few friends from uni and in tow... SmallMoon

Boyfriend and I glance at each other. Oh shit. She knows where I live. To be fair to my other friend

It begins. 

&gt;People starting to show up

&gt;Have sick setup for LAN in the basement: 4TVs + 4 XBoxes = 16 player Halo. 

&gt;Food everywhere. Pizza, veggie platters, hummus and veggie chips... basically including everyone's dietary needs. 

&gt;SmallMoon and EventualPlanet end up sitting next to each other. 

&gt;Happened because SmallMoon kept trying to sit next to Boyfriend and I asked EventualPlanet to distract her because they seem to like each other and sometimes EventualPlanet can be a bro. 

&gt;All is going surprisingly well. 

&gt;Suddenly both SmallMoon and EventualPlanet ""give up"" because ""this is stupid"" and pass their controllers on so they can load up huge plates of pizza and chips and guzzle down some liquid beetus. 

&gt;It was kinda stupid

&gt;Anyways. 

&gt;Somehow SmallMoon and EventualPlanet end up sitting next to me

&gt;SmallMoon says the veggies aren't party food (teehee). 

&gt;EventualPlanet pegs them as my idea

&gt;They were

&gt;I ""mhm"" and otherwise try to ignore them. 

&gt;""SometimesIArt is on some sort of health kick right now."" 

&gt;For the past year and a bit

&gt;""Oh

&gt;I look away from my violently exploding character to Bertstare at SmallMoon. 

&gt;""We didn't talk about it

&gt;""Oh sorry teehee... I didn't mean it

&gt;""Thanks for apologizing."" 

&gt;Pretty shitty apology but I'll take it

&gt;""But you know you shouldn't deny yourself taking pleasure in food. Who you are is who you are and you will look how you are built to look.""

&gt;Ohh no.

&gt;""Thanks for the concern

EventualPlanet has this incredibly annoying habit of sharing everything with everyone about my life. Like once I forgot to brush my teeth (which I do obsessively) before leaving with the roommates for a movie night and she told everyone at the house that if they smelled something weird it was probably my breath. Shit like that. All the freaking time. It's supposed to be a joke

&gt;""Ewww how can you live like that?"" 

&gt;""Ehhhhh..."" Still trying to ignore them and play the game. 

&gt;SmallMoon says ""seriously I would rather be a little chubby than be stuck eating tasteless food and starving all day."" 

&gt;Wat. 

&gt;EventualPlanet agrees. ""Yeah and no one is happy with their body anyways so there's no use obsessing over image."" 

&gt;Start looking around for someone to save me so I can swap out and leave for a bit. Boyfriend is off across the room

&gt;""How thin is thin enough anyways?""

All was well for the rest of the night. They both actively avoided me so I thought I had sidestepped any more problems and it being the end of the year and SmallMoon's graduation

Nope. 

She had to get one last thing in before she left. Not FPS but wrapping up the series with her forever and ever. 

&gt;Boyfriend is driving straight from my house to the air port. 

&gt;Going to England for the next month to visit parents.

&gt;His roommate is here to pick him up. 

&gt;Being the ""goodbye for a month"" girlfriend

&gt;SmallMoon's ride is leaving at the same time. 

&gt;SmallMoon asks if Boyfriend is sticking around for summer. 

&gt;Tells the truth.

&gt;Small moon freaks out and demands a hug

&gt;Awkwardly long. 

&gt;Boyfriend isn't hugging back. 

&gt;He finally says ""okay"" and pushes her back.

Now, I was on my highschool wresting team &amp; by some miracle still retain much of the physique of those days.

We both eat relatively healthy most days - only getting the McBeetus **maybe** once a month. Husband-in-training is a BBQ grill master

Our trips to the amusement park are a big-time cheat day for both of us

&gt; ""U THINK JIST BECUZ U SKINNY

&gt; ""WHY U SERVING HER FIRST?! SHE'S GOTS NO CURVZZZZ""

Hot-chick is now bright red

Boyfriend and I in shock. Never actually witnessed anything like this before!

&gt; Hamplanet obviously seething

&gt; Another yum-yum shop employee comes up

&gt; we go to first employee &amp; place order. He's obviously upset. Hands shaking

&gt; husband-in-training giving me the ""don't say anything!!!"" look *fucking beta*

For those who read my [Baby Phat story](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gqwcj/baby_phat/)

&gt; Look straight at Hamplanet

&gt; Notice hot-chick is grabbing napkins a couple feet away

&gt; ""don't let the bitch get to you. she only wishes she looked that good in a bikini. and some people are cunts at any size""

Employee scurries away to hide laughter

Hot-chick stares at me with mouth open

Husband-in-training can't restrain himself

Hamplanet stares and sputters

I grab food and husband-in-training and stalk away

*Camera pans from Rod Serling over to OP. Jimmes begin to rustle*

&gt;&gt;Still be me

&gt;&gt;Still working crappy shift from part III. 

&gt;&gt;Everyone in the ICU was trying to concentrate on the mother that was in critical condition. We had never had a baby born in the ICU and wanted to stabilize her and keep it that way.

&gt;&gt;I decide to go take a quick break in our break room. I then remembered the 4-dozen bagels and cards that a patient's family brought as a thank you. Decide to try regain some faith in humanity with a nice everything bagel and read some of the cards.

&gt;&gt;Sit down. 

&gt;&gt;Basketball game is on tv. 

&gt;&gt;Cards are on the table. 

&gt;&gt;Bagels are all gone. 

&gt;&gt;Fresh pot of coffee brewing. 

&gt;&gt;If only but for a moment

&gt;&gt;Only 7 other nurses on that shift who share this breakroom.
&gt;&gt;Only one nurse said he was able to grab a bagel. No one knew what happened to them. Everyone starts getting pissed. 

&gt;&gt;I think fps knows what happened to them.

&gt;&gt;Suddenly the alarms by my desk start going off. I slam my coffee and get up from the break room to go see what was going on. The expensive machine whose only job is to go “Ping!” is loudly going “Ping!” I look at the monitors and Hamspanic’s heart rate starts getting really elevated and she starts throwing a few PVCs

&gt;&gt;Heart rate still increasing. More PVCs. Decided to go in there. 


FPS...prepare to say goodbye to the last of your jimmies if you have any left at this point.

&gt;&gt;She has turned blue **again**....and was eating all of our bagels from the boxes on her bed. GramHam had taken off the oxygen meter and put it on her own finger so that her daughter could eat some more before she was put on the vent without us interfering. 

&gt;&gt;I yell for the charge nurse to come in immediately since I have no idea what her actual oxygen rate is and slap the bagel out of her hand and push the CPAP over her face.

&gt;&gt;“Nerrrrrr. *GASP* I wants mah BAHGUL!”
 
&gt;&gt;GramHam: “You people are starving my poor baby. Don’t you morons know she has to eat. She is really nervous about the procedure tomorrow and eating calms her down!”
I glare at this 400 lbs fossil and see that she was also [eating an everything bagel](http://i.imgur.com/698CCV5.gif). 

&gt;&gt;Hamana was sitting in her power chair [eating two bagels sandwiching a tub of cream cheese](http://i.imgur.com/PySgvqd.gif). 

&gt;&gt;Peter Pannis was crouched in the corner covered in cinnamon toast bagel crumbs. The fat ninja had defeated us.

Stressed Charge Nurse Bro was in the middle of helping an ob/gyn with an emergency C-Section in the room next door and part of a team trying unsuccessfully to keep 3 month old infant alive. 

&gt;&gt;SCNB: “I don’t give a shit about Hamspanic anymore Tardismyspiritanimal! Let her kill herself. I’m trying to save two people that are desperately trying to hold on to their lives. Just order me a damn chopper for the baby.”

Somehow mention there are also no more bagels (I think someone asked me if there were any more blueberry bagels on my way out of the room). 

&gt;&gt;Charge nurse is one of my favorite bros and he has had a shitty night. Now

&gt;&gt;Somehow

&gt;&gt;The weeks of cleaning out “The Kitty, the infant that he knows will probably be dead in the next few minutes, the mother was crashing, and the father was crying and wanting to know what will happen to his wife and child, 


and now no delicious cinnamon toast bagels. 

&gt;&gt;He pulls me aside and whispers in my ear “I will *twitch* personally smother that thundercunt *twitch* with her own moldy tits if she hasn’t been intubated by the time I *twitch* get out of here. [And I will set the other three on fire if I ever see their faces again!](http://i.imgur.com/X4j46gr.gif)” 

&gt;&gt;He pulls away smiling maniacally and makes a some circles in the air with his hands and says “Whoosh” ([presumably indicating a fire](http://i.imgur.com/G4kefku.gif)) then turns back to helping the ob/gyn. 


Now...not wanting Stressed Charge Nurse Bro to go to jail I moved rather quickly.


At first I didn’t think I had that much power in my position. But then realized I controlled the phones, scheduled and prioritized all procedures and tests, and relayed orders to the other departments in the hospital on the behalf of the nurses. The nurses and physicians would often just give me their passwords to enter in override orders for them. Sort of like a “Steward” or “Hand of the King.”

&gt;&gt;I called the pulmonologist (at like 11PM mind you...he was PISSSED) and explained the situation. We scheduled the intubation for right then instead of in the morning. I walked in there with respiratory, and several techs toting the vent.
“Wat are glarbalglarbal you doing? *Gasp* I blarbgalabrelel 8 more hours to eat ALL I want *wheeze*” If you ain’t nice to me ya’ll have ta clean out Kittay!”

&gt;&gt;The team descended upon here and within 10 minutes she was sedated

&gt;&gt;Security kicked all of the family out and banned from ever coming back into the ICU. Peter Pannis the fat ninja threw down a smoke bomb and disappeared into the night. Social services and the police were also notified. 

I looked over at Stressed Charge Nurse Bro coming out of the other room. They were loading the infant into some sort of ungodly incubator/ventilator the size of a fridge and were sending it off to the [chopper](http://youtu.be/Xs_OacEq2Sk?t=3s).

&gt;&gt;A team was in there stabilizing the critical mom. She was hemorrhaging badly

&gt;&gt;Stressed Charge Nurse Bro just went in the break room and [just sat there](http://i.imgur.com/Pmn0Tv5.gif). He stared blankly forward. It looked like his soul had left his body

Working in the ICU you don’t have to deal with babies

&gt;&gt;“Am I going to go to have to go to jail tonight?”


&gt;&gt;”Not tonight Stressed Charge Nurse Bro. I handled it.”


[HFW](http://i.imgur.com/Ud7BQvn.gif) I recap the last 30 minutes.


&gt;&gt;”Thanks Tardismyspiritanimal.”


&gt;&gt;Hands me his credit card.


&gt;&gt;”Go get us some something to eat...something healthy.”


Casualty report for the evening. An entire ICU nutrition room, and my faith in humanity.

**TL:DR Hamspanic finally gets silenced because she won't stop eating.**

When I was 15/16 years old

1) Being like a 50s drive in

2) Our ""carnival"" food - like corn dogs. We also had a massive, to be young again)

Due to the nature of food we served and the ultimate lazy factor - stay in your car and MAKE SKINNY PEOPLE BRING YOU FOOD - we attracted some incredible specimens.

Now, this woman. She and her husband (who I'm pretty sure was her cousin) would roll up EVERY DAY in their van, 3 roly poly disabled children in tow. The collective gusts of their labored breathing as I walked up to their car window nearly blew me over, and the stench - my god the smell. It was atrocious. Like a mixture between rotten milk, bodily fluids, and dead animals. Their van was piled with trash from fast food visits past; their hair hung long and stringy in a botched homage to a newborn Orc. The woman wore the same thing every visit - a stained Mickey Mouse t-shirt and spandex leggings - and it made me wonder if she was, in fact

Now

Every day, 15 hamburgers (extra mayo), a veritable bucket of fries, etc. Since we were famous for ice cream, everyone in the smell-van would order our biggest size of milkshake - or slush - or malt - or whatever their black holes desired that day. On this particular summer afternoon, queen landwhale opened her trembling jowels and demanded a milkshake made in our biggest cup: 44ounces. 44ounces of milk and ice cream. After I had informed her that our machines couldn't blend in a cup that big and she had a fit, she ordered our biggest size for milkshakes: 32 ounces.

All was well as they munched away happily... until her voice came over the loudspeaker

Sighing

""Ma'am."" I leveled her reasonably

She narrowed her beady eyes at me, rolling up her window and speeding - er, slowly driving - out of the parking lot.

With the remnants of ""rotten milkshake"" on me

That's the first lady hambeast story.

The second? I don't want to go into too much detail with this one to spare your stomachs

I took two or three orders out and she was still in there

Finally

Something brown.

Oh. Oh NO.

I tried to skate by her as quickly as possible

I wanted to cry. I knew it was going to be bad, breath held, terror gripping me.

I felt like I was looking at a historical photograph of war time terror acts.

So my senior year in high school I took a nursing assistant class. I lived about 2 miles away from my high school

&gt; Super nervous

&gt; Get assigned patient, and any problems we might encounter

&gt; Since its our first day we get two people per patient.

&gt; Get paired with good friend

&gt; Shes only 4'11"" and about 80 pounds.

&gt; I'm 5'8"", not much fat

&gt; I lift

&gt; Our patient is middle aged lady

&gt; Walk into the room

&gt; Call her Hamplanet Patient or HPP

&gt; This wasn't in the patient assignment sheet

&gt; Ask nurse

&gt; Says shes 600 pounds

&gt; She has bloody poops all over her backside

&gt; Oh god no.

&gt; Not on my first day.

&gt; Worst nightmare

&gt; At least it can never get worst.

&gt; Get our nursing instructor to help us with the patient

&gt; She looks just as shocked as we did

&gt; Need a 4th body to help out

&gt; Get her nurse

&gt; Eventually get her turned over

&gt; Use 10 washclothes to clean her

&gt; Not enough

&gt; Must have used close to 25 washcloths just on her back and he butt

&gt; All the sudden I feel a warm sensation on my stomach and arms.

&gt; Oh god. No.

&gt; [MFW HPP gets shits bloody projectile shit all over the front of my scrubs and arms.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif)

&gt; Eventually get her completely washed. Took over an hour with four people.

&gt; Continue doing morning care on her.

&gt; Comb hair

&gt; Doctor comes in. Stand off to the side.

&gt; She was admitted the night earlier. Must be a regular.

&gt; Doctor asks what she eats.

&gt; She kept a food diary.

&gt; Doctor invites me and my partner to look over the diary with him.

&gt; Shocked

&gt; Might have heard from the nurse my terrible displeasure earlier.

&gt; The diary consists of fast food

&gt; Thought it was her food for a month.

&gt; It was for a single week.

&gt; Doctors says she needs to eat healthier and lose weight. Her diet was a major factor in her cancer -- which is almost in remission. Don't know how.

&gt; ""I'm just going to get a lap band surgery. Then I can eat what ever I want without worry.""

&gt; The fatlogic defies me.

&gt; Doctor

&gt; HPP

&gt; [Our faces when](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/question-mark.gif)

&gt; More arguing.

&gt; Doctor leaves.

&gt; Continue doing morning care.

&gt; Breakfast arrives.

&gt; Fruits

&gt; Looks good

&gt; She says she won't eat any of it. 

&gt; Try to convince her.

&gt; She literally forces the tray into my partners hands.

&gt; Don't know what to do. 

&gt; Get nursing instructor.

This is the first installment of a series of encounters with the foul, thinkin’ too hard makes muh beetus flare up). This is the story of how I met her in my second week of high school during lunchtime—coincidentally her favorite time of the day.

&gt;Be me


&gt;Be 8/10, in an unfamiliar environment with no real friends and a serious case of social anxiety


&gt;Be sitting in the glass partition between the hall and the front of my school


&gt;My homosense begins to tingle, or deodorant approaching slowly from behind


&gt;I glance to the side, legs the color of Bavarian cream moving past me on the other side of the glass


&gt;I refuse to look up


&gt;Ripping the door from its hinges, “Haaaaaiiiii guuuuuyttttthhhh!!”


&gt;In horror


&gt;”Hi, in an offhand voice


&gt;I gather Hamtasia cares less for Lardnia that fatties care for pool parties without refreshments


&gt;”Ohhhhh


&gt;Realizing she means me


&gt;Hamtasia begins begrudging introductions as I take in all that is Lardnia


&gt;Standing at 6’0 and weighing in at 280lbs, grease covered glasses


&gt;Lardnia has no neck


&gt;What she does have is a gut of global proportions


&gt;Her long chicken legs bent somehow a bit backward at the knees


&gt;A curtain of greasy hair fell past her shoulder blades in the back


&gt;[MFW](http://www.badhaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/han-solo-shocked-e1362167609917.jpg) Lardnia’s body was an [AT-ST]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/Star_Wars_All_Terrain_Scout_Transport.jpg)


&gt;Lardnia pivots and begins to fall backwards towards me


&gt;She lands on her tiny ass inches from my right arm


&gt;She slaps her Hungry Man frozen dinner on the floor, 4 vanilla Snackpacks and 2 massive gas station M&amp;M cookies


&gt;Lardnia pulls out a ninja manga, still paritially frozen


&gt;lardniadontgiveashit.jpeg


&gt;Her BO bitchslaps me in the face


&gt;Through my watering eyes


&gt;Throughout the carnage


&gt;Her fluttering eyelashes do nothing but fan her retched odor towards my disintegrating olfactory receptors. I fight for consciousness


&gt;The massacre ends after 5 minutes


&gt;With a sigh of temporary contention, exclaiming:


&gt;”Ya know, teehee!”


&gt;”Effrebuddy thayth I look jutht like [female manga character]


&gt;Sensing danger


&gt;”Tread carefully


&gt;”Ah… cool” I manage to say


&gt;The muffled sound of crusty fingernails scratching cloth is then heard. “Dafuq?” thinks I


&gt;The upper arm of Lardnia’s free hand is in rhythmic locomotion


&gt;I note that Lardnia has a Funyun encrusted paw beneath her lard globe


&gt;Ah… Lardnia has a feminine itch


&gt;My mind reels in revulsion


&gt;The never-healing woman-wound is a foreign and unpleasant object in my mind


&gt;Oblivious to my disgust


&gt;”Ya thee


&gt;*Scratch scratch*


&gt;”He gave me thith diamon’ ring, right here?” 


&gt;Wrenching her gina-scratchin paw from under her globe, a length on wire twisted several times around her pudgy finger with a ~~rhinestone~~ ~~glass~~ plastic cube in it. The cube has a hole drilled through the center, the wire goes through the hole


&gt;prettydamnsurethatisntadiamon.pdf


&gt;WARNING: IRRITATION LEVELS REACHING CRITICAL


&gt;OVERRIDE: COMMON SENSE


&gt;SARCASM: ACTIVATED


&gt;”Didn’t know you could drill a hole through diamond


&gt;The well-oiled gears begin turning in Lardnia’s head


&gt;SARCASM: CONFIRMED


&gt;HAMBITCH MODE: ACTIVATED


&gt;”Ya callin’ me a liar?!” Lardnia growls


&gt;*”No! Anything but that


&gt;My mind enters beta-mode


&gt;”N-no, errrrm, craftsmanship. It *must* have been expensive.”


&gt;I choke on my lie


&gt;Confusion crosses Lardnia’s face


&gt;I hear a chorus of angels singing


&gt;Nay, an end to the unbearable stench that has permeated my very skin!  


&gt;I fled the partition faster than a fatty fleeing an eggplant convention


&gt;Gods but I couldn’t know! For my brush with all that is fat and repulsive was but the first of many

[Part II](http://redd.it/1iy5ms)

**Part IIIa: Flabpotamus gets a crush part 1**

 Here we introduce DoctorBro, loved medicine, and would frequently get excited about it to Steve Irwin proportions. 

Pertinent to this part of the story is that I am studying 2nd year medicine at this point. Doctorbro makes an effort to show me interesting cases – if the patient is comfortable with it

Flabpotamus has focused her tractor beam eyes on DoctorBro, sugarcoated beetusflirt act. Poor DoctorBro is recently divorced, and so (according to FatFuck) fair game. She listens with great interest whenever he and one of the other doctors or nurses are chatting about a new treatment or interesting case, interjecting to say “oh isn’t that amazing” yes, penicillin comes from mould, “isn’t that wonderful” yes, broken bones heal. And then makes some lame excuse to make an appointment to see him because she suffers from a similar ailment to what they are discussing. 

She learns that he does cosmetic collagen filler injections and guess what? – she needs to have her lips injected. According to NurseBro, which DoctorBro seemed to be completely oblivious to. She said at one point “Oh, I would never get botox around my lips, I need to be able to purse them to you know, pleasure a man orally”, at which DoctorBro nonchalantly asked her to stop talking so he could do the injections.

We were blessed for the next few weeks by her increased pouting and duckface

Anyway

She spots us walking out of his office one day and raised her eyebrows as far and as long as her poor muscles can work against gravity with that much forehead fat.

Soon I start to hear the accusations. She never points to me directly, and tells me to watch out if DoctorBroEx ever comes into the clinic to see him or do something for their teenage children. She’ll pop out of her dungeon and waddle over to the desk and, say in a spittle strewn stage whisper “Oh, watch out, the woman spurned is here. You better hide, Lemurella.”


When this happens my co-workers generally look at me blankly then go back to their work


It culminates to one day when DoctorBro and I are in his office talking about some sort of medical thing
She stammers when she sees us obviously clothed and not partaking in any sort of sexual congress.

&gt;“Excuse me

&gt;“Oh,” she says 

&gt; of course she expected to see me here

&gt;“Just what are you doing here


&gt;DoctorBro pipes up “More to the point what are you doing here? Lemurella

&gt;“What do you mean?”

&gt;“Lemurella is studying medicine. I’m helping her out with an assignment.”

&gt;“Oh...I”

&gt;“And what did you want?”

&gt;“Oh

&gt;“Of course that’s okay. You don’t need to interrupt me with that kind of thing. Now please leave us alone.”

&gt;She grunts and closes the door. When we can hear that she has waddled out of ear shot

I am amazed – I didn’t know he’d even noticed. Such is his professional detachment and good bedside manner.

&gt;“No seriously, and lots and lots of poo, but nothing has made me gag more than that woman.”

&gt;I smirk the smirkiest smirk I can smirk.

&gt;Be me

&gt;Horray

&gt;I love my kid.  What can I do to show her how awesome she is?

&gt;I know!  I'll let her invite as many little kids as she wants to her party and I'll let her decide what food we serve.

&gt;[mfw](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10413) she requests a cake with no icing, and ""No pop, Mummy!  It hurts my tummy.""  So proud of that healthy-ish party choice.

&gt;It's the day of the party.

&gt;No one in this freakin' town understands the courtesy of the RSVP.  Whatevs.  I'll have supplies for 12 little girls.  I hope we don't get all 20 showing up.

&gt;[mfw](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=6443) 12 girls show up.  I am a junior party god!

&gt;11 of the girls are lovely little things.  I get my daughter to give them the tour of the house and then set them loose to run around screaming.  Little girls run around and scream at parties.  A lot.  There may be games of ""Zombie Princess"".

&gt;Am enjoying the mayhem and look of horror on the faces of my husband and son when the doorbell rings.

&gt;I answer it and behold Hamela Junior.

&gt;She's six.  I know she's six because my daughter told me so.  Why the fuck is she built like a mini linebacker?

&gt;Whatever.  Maybe it's just baggie clothes.

&gt;I send Hamela Junior to play with the other little girls while I work on slicing strawberries for the angel food cake.  If I can keep them out of the kitchen for 20 minutes I can finish the cake and stay on track.

&gt;[LOL NOPE!](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=9396)  I hear a noise.  Look

&gt;I break up her one-person feeding frenzy, and meat and send her outside to play.

&gt;5 minutes later I turn around again:  Look!  It's Hamela Junior!  She's found the dip!  She's fucking eating it with a goddamn spoon

OK.  Right now let's just cut through the next hour.  It involves my husband staring in disbelief at a kid who won't stop snarfelling every fucking bit of finger food that she can reach.  

&gt;[HFW](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=7460) the girl.  Won't. Stop. Eating.

&gt;Whatever.  I service cake.  Homemade angel cake with ice cream (health conscious is one thing but denying ice cream at a six year old's birthday party is a dangerous thing that could end up with you being trampled by many pairs of small shoes decorated with sequins and flashing lights).  There are also strawberries.

&gt;Hamela Junior eats two servings of cake and ice cream.  She also complains that another little girl got special ice cream all to herself.

Another note:  That little girl is lactose intolerant.  I got her a little container of almond-based dairy substitute.  I'm a junior party god

&gt;OK.  All the small (and the one not-so-small) kids have had cake and ice cream and are back outside.  I will relax with my husband.

&gt;[Wait

&gt;Only an hour left of this party.  [I got this](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10285).

&gt;Hamela Junior comes in

&gt;1 (guess who was first in line?), 4 (the line is moving swiftly), 5, 6 ... WTF!  Hamela is back in line with an empty bowl!  Fine.  [Whatever.  I give up.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10081)

&gt;7, 10, 11, 12, 13 (Hamela made an extra trip!) and done!    Or not.  Guess who's back with an empty bowl. 

&gt;[No.  I am done.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10187)

&gt;Sorry Hamela Junior!  No more ice cream!

&gt;Such a look of pain on her face.  ""Why not?"" demands the pint-sized porker.

&gt;""We're saving some for later!""

&gt;She scowls.  [I do not feel bad.](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=8663).

&gt;She then goes and asks my husband to serve her more ice cream.  He also [refuses to indulge Hamela Junior any more](http://reactiongifs.com/?p=10300).

And then the magic hour arrives!  Parents come to pick up their kids! I receive sticky hugs and ""thank you"" from 11 happy little girls

Then it's Hamela Junior's turn to leave.  Her mother

&gt;Hamela Junior grunts

&gt;Hamela Senior clutches her precious mini lard beast to her enormously uplifted cleavage and gives me death glares.  I am clearly an evil wench who starves small children!

I was born into a skinny, even though I wasn’t eating differently. I was so exhausted all the time; I would walk upstairs to get something from my room and have to take a nap. 20 pounds later (150 lbs at 5’8) my mom insisted I go to the doctor. I tested positive for hypothyroidism, but since I was still going through puberty my doctor didn’t feel comfortable giving me medication that could interfere with my hormones. I was miserable, but after a few days I realized that if my metabolism wasn’t working as quickly as it used to, I probably didn’t need as many calories as I used to eat. I went from about 1,200 calories a day to 700, and the more I cut my calories

In AIT, you start as a Phase IV, that means, on weekends, you have formation at 6AM, 1PM, and 6PM. You also have fireguard (2-hour shifts just sitting and watching the hallways) on the weekends, and you can't go off post

After 3 weeks, you can go off post, wear civilians, and the only formation you have is at 1PM.  

The final phase, and all the previous perks mentioned. The best part is, all you have to pass is a locker inspection. 

Now, in the middle of a divorce, and notorious for looking like a spitting image of James Earl Jones. It would all be well and good if he wasn't notorious for gaming the system. With this story in particular, he gamed the phase-up system. With phasing up, if you did not pass a PT test, you were not allowed the opportunity to phase up. However, if you went on medical profile after you failed your first PT test--typed statement saying certain injuries restrict you from doing exercise--you were given the opportunity to phase up. This story describes the first time he tried to phase up.

So here is the [Venti Frappaccino](http://i.imgur.com/Dfn1lcy.jpg), extra caramel, and a brownie blended in (many a spaghetti was spilled asking for the last one). Manner can get you a long way though.

The cashier may or may not have heard me about the whipping cream part

[Here is the receipt](http://i.imgur.com/PKGrW5T.jpg?1). As fast-food is a lot smaller and more expensive here in New Zealand

Now to actually drinking it: It didn't actually taste that bad. It tasted a lot like [Cookies &amp; Cream Ice Cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookies_and_Cream), so I gave up 3/4 of the way though and just gave it to a friend. There's no way I can ever imagine drinking an American-sized version of this. Let alone two, and with whipping cream.

First some back story: I met Popalopagus when I was about 6, and always maintained we were around the same size). This first installment takes place when we are both around 14 or so, and she has ballooned into  [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-30763-body-shape.htm?StartAt=1#.UdTL0fn-E_8), while still claiming we are the same size. Meanwhile, I look like something like [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-32812-body-shape.htm?StartAt=21#.UdTMtvn-E_8). I'm 25 now, so this story happened ages ago and for reasons that will become apparent I no longer associate with Popalopagus &amp; friends.

&gt;Be me
&gt;Do not be Popalopagus
&gt;Be hanging out with a group of your juvenile delinquent friends

&gt;EmoKid is Popalopagus's crush

&gt;Everyone is hungry for some reason, fair enough they are damn delicious.

&gt;Be me, she's about 12 but super awesome so we hang out with her all the time). We reach the shop and obtain pies. 
&gt;I get one pie

walkinghomesinging.mp3

&gt;Arrive back at the house to find Popalopagus watching TV and eating popcorn and a delicious looking panini. ""I got hungry waiting for your guys,""
&gt;WisdomSkinny says she wants a drink first

&gt;Feeling thirsty

&gt;BIG MISTAKE.

&gt;Return 5 minutes later to empty popcorn bag
[MFW](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/39003-wat-know-your-meme-gif-olJb.gif) there are only 3 pies left.

&gt;She notices we are all staring at her in shock.
&gt;""What? I asked you to get me 4 pies.""
&gt;HotBro says ""Ummm
&gt;My pie is still there
&gt;HotBro says ""Think about it. 7 Pies. 2 for you, and WisdomSkinny spent the last of her pocket money on that pie you gobbled.""
&gt;""No, I thought she probably changed her mind and didn't get one.""

&gt;WisdomSkinny is very hungry and starts to cry. Reminding us all that she is only 12. We forget often.
&gt;""So why did you only give me enough for two pies then?"" asks HotBro.
&gt;Popalopagus replies ""You OWED me that money
&gt;By this time I am giving WisdomSkinny a hug and she is crying quietly into my shirt. Jimmies very rustled because WisdomSkinny is so sweet and now she's sad.

&gt;Popalopagus turns to WisdomSkinny ""Oh
&gt;""Oh right, and I can do WHAT I WANT!""

1371497282.0,1gj94e,Cakes over Dates,homehealthgirl,402,61,64,"Hello again. I debated posting this and another story about an acquaintence of mine

&gt; Be me

&gt; Prom is in a few weeks

&gt; I've had no contact with Beretta since the incident with drama club earlier that year

&gt; I spend my lunch and the hour afterwards on Wednesdays in an office in the library doing Conflict Resolution.

&gt; Pretty typical day

&gt; All the little kiddies are in a good mood because of the weather

&gt; Knock on the door, and rather than detention they chose to try a mediation.

&gt; All right

&gt; Few minutes later the hall monitor escorts down two girls.

&gt; Of course one of them is Beretta.

&gt; Decide to speak to the sophomore that was also involved first.

&gt; be her, plays varsity tennis, 90lb if that.

&gt; We'll call her Bonita.

&gt; Bonita


Bonita explains that they were celebrating Cinco De Mayo in Spanish class. She had made a whole tray of [Mexican Wedding Cakes](http://food.sndimg.com/img/recipes/15/06/8/large/picTsTVUJ.jpg) for her class to share. They also had a buffet with taco meat, beans, corn salsa, and several other assorted desserts and pop. This was all brought in by students; if they couldn't bring in food, they were asked to bring paper plates, napkins, anything that they could to contribute. Beretta hadn't brought anything


Everyone had gone up for their first serving of lunch, and then share with the class.


While sitting with her friends Bonita saw Beretta, Mexican Wedding Cake, Carmel Cake, and some of the Tres Leches fruit Parfait. Bonita goes up to her and kindly explains that the desserts weren't opened yet for a reason, and would she be kind enough to wait till the presentations were over before eating them, thinking that maybe Beretta hadn't caught the memo. Bonita didn't want her to be embarrassed as she was the only one with desserts.


Beretta apparently then made some flippant remark about how she was the only girl who had grabbed desserts because she was comfortable with her figure. Bonita again tried to explain her that it's not about who is and who isn't eating


Beretta, so Bonita put down the dessert plate, handed the glass of pop to Beretta and gave her a few good slaps to the back.


After catching a good breath

&gt; ""Get your hands off me you anorexic whore.""

The teacher heard the choking and was making her way over to see what was going on.

&gt; ""Excuse me?"" asks Bonita.

&gt; ""You heard me

&gt; Bonita

&gt; ""Go throw up in the bathroom so you'll fit into your prom dress. I hope you get in a car accident and die on your way to prom

&gt; Bonita's [FW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/um-no.gif) when Beretta grabs a taco and starts to eat again.

&gt; The teacher heard the comments and assumed that something else must have occurred as well in order for anyone to retaliate in that manner. Sends both Bonita and Beretta to the office.

I didn't need to hear anymore. I went and got Ms. Director and explained the situation. There was no mediation necessary in my opinion. The correct response should have been for Bonita to directly notify her teacher rather than confronting Beretta

I recommended Beretta have some private counseling time with Ms. Director or one of us Mediators

Ms. Director ended up listening to both sides. Beretta didn't even bother to try to lie her way out of this one and per my recommendation in order to stay out of detention she had to have one fully week of private counseling with her or one of us during lunch. Beretta opts to try a peer mediator first. Bonita declines the offer of a follow-up session

&gt; First day of private counseling with Beretta*

&gt; I ask her why she got so angry with Bonita.

&gt; ""Well

&gt; Beretta

&gt; ""No

&gt; Then why did you react aggressively?

&gt; ""Because she's a bitch.""

&gt; How is she a bitch for asking something politely? 

&gt; ""...""

&gt; Do you have a specific problem with Bonita?

&gt; ""She just thinks she's so pretty and so perfect and I'm sick of it. I'm not jealous or anything.""

&gt; Beretta, Blondie and I usually do cardio after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays if you want to join us. We usually just do the ellipticals or the treadmills.

Now, being as what I'm occasionally called an ""athletic"" build, which is a kind way of saying ""Tall and flat"". I come from a small place, so I know that Beretta knew what I looked like before/after. 

&gt; ""mumblemumblemumble""

&gt; Beretta

&gt; ""Skinny bitches like you don't know shit about me or what I go through. Taking a walk isn't going to fix me

&gt; Beretta storms off.

&gt; Goes to principal says she'd rather have detention.

&gt; This is the second to last time I'll ever interact with Beretta.

**Chapter Five**

I took a meandering route home, I had a chance to reflect on all that had occurred, and I found myself feeling equal parts revulsion and intrigue.

Though I had only interacted with her for a few brief seconds, and that her domineering roommate had simply found out and claimed me for herself. Unfortunately, my rational mind insisted that something different had occurred. The most likely explanation was that I *hadn't* seen Lauren's breasts; that the picture which had attracted me was something pulled from the Internet, or perhaps another advertisement. Still, if that had been the case, why had Lauren been so embarrassed?

The advertisement was still on my screen when I woke my computer from sleep mode. I saved the picture and copied the text before doing anything else, however, had the unintended effect of setting my chat program's status back to “Online,” and a few seconds later, a familiar chime informed me that I had received a message.

It was, what are we doing tomorrow?” she asked.

I considered not responding. The evening had been frustrating to no end, perhaps more honestly than I should have.

“We could go back to the same place and get the same things!”

There was a certain logic to the suggestion,” I answered.

There was a pause as Porcina typed her next message. “Sorry about Lauren

“What do you mean?” I asked, no matter *what* the truth about the evening might be! Porcina's answer was a rambling story, full of cryptic twists and likely half-truths, from which I was able to glean the following:

Lauren and Porcina had met during their freshman year of high school. Porcina had approached the smaller girl after seeing her alone during lunch, with Porcina sticking up for Lauren whenever necessary. This had endeared Porcina to Lauren's mother, a single parent of similar size and stature to her daughter, and before long, Porcina was something like a second child. When Lauren's mother needed some time alone, the two girls would stay at Porcina's house, amidst her many brothers and their doting parents. Lauren was gifted food, clothes, it seemed only natural for the two of them to become roommates. The rent for their townhouse was shared by both of them

It was an interesting story, an ongoing habit for her to omit the most pertinent details. “Sounds like you guys have been through a lot,” I finally typed. “Why are you apologizing, though?”

There was another pause

“That's not what happened *at all*, and I felt bad. That's all.”

To be honest, admittedly, distracted, having left Craigslist for more immediate stimulation and taken my sexual frustration into my own hands. This would prove to be my biggest mistake, for while in the throes of arousal, I made the monumentally stupid decision to ask if there were any more pictures available. It turned out that, in fact

Fortunately, and all but begged for a freebie or two. True, it might have been simpler to offer her a counterfeit image of my own, but I didn't want to risk her sharing it with Lauren. In hindsight, I should have suspected that our entire exchange would be repeated, but at the time, I was too thrilled when I saw a file transfer beginning.

It was a picture much like the one I had already seen... except this one included Lauren's face

There was no denying it after that. Lauren *had* been a participant in the posting of the advertisement

“So, why did she drop you off at the diner?”

There was no response. 

I would learn the following morning that Porcina had spontaneously fallen asleep, and wonder what the next day would bring.

This story takes place after the wonderful NurseLovely retired and had a great outgoing party and in her place came in NurseJiggles

NurseJiggles was a lazy fuck to put it lightly

Veterans of FPS can already tell where this is going

Its my mom's birthday! WOOHOO! but she still has to work (WHYGODWHY!) so she showed up at the hospital with some cheesecake and cookies

[D'aww](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28800000/SpongeDaww-spongebob-squarepants-28843255-339-498.jpg)

He tries to find her but couldn't so he ends up going to a nurse to ask where she is

""WHATS A MAN LIKE YOU LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE HER?!""

""She's my wife and its her birthday

""YOU?! HER?! PLEASE!""

""What?..""

""YOU NEED A GIRL WITH MEAT ON HER BONES

""Ohkay...""

""TELL ME

""That's personal""

""YOU KNOW THAT CURVY GIRLS KNOW THINGS THAT SKINNY BITCHES DONT""

""Don't you dare call my wife a bitch""

""SKINNY BITCH""

""Go to hell""

So he walked away and found my mom. When he was about to leave my mom and dad had a mini kissing session in front of the nurses station

Pleaselordnotthatimageinmyhead!!!

""TAKE YOUR FILTH SOMEWHERE ELSE!""

""Nah

Nurse Jiggles got up to separate my mom and dad with mayo all over her face and ended up tripping with the force of a thousand stampeding elephants

""SOMEONE HELP ME! THIS BITCH TRIPPED ME! FUCKING TWIG!""

wtf.nologic

The sight of three nurses trying to hold NurseJiggles up was probably the funniest thing ever

""YOU CANT HANDLE A WOMAN LIKE ME! GET ME UP! FAT SHAMING ASSHOLES! I'LL TELL THE CHIEF ABOUT WHAT YOU DID""

""Go for it"" (The chief loved my mom)

""YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SKINNY YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH BULLYING PEOPLE AND MAKING FUN OF THEM??!""

""Whatever""

My mom went back to her office and my dad went back home

Hope you guys enjoyed my little tale of the Ham. Was my first post here

To answer some questions asked in the last installment:

- This happened around 2009

- Hamburglar went on to get alienated because of her rude behavior

- Had a drama-filled relationship with literally the most horrifyingly awkward guy in school (Not his fault though

- Hamburglar graduated high school last year and judging by her Facebook

- All the other girls in the story are in their last year of high school,False,self,t5_2vzax,1368251788.0,,,t3_1e47cz

**Chapter Four**

There have only been a few times in my life when I have been shocked into silence, and fastidious, who had said no more than a single word to me, and who was so incredibly embarrassed by the combination of my presence and her roommate's behavior that she could do nothing more than stare at her own feet.

“You've seen her *boobs*!” Porcina cackled again, but I didn't know whether to request it, attempt to comfort Lauren, respond to Porcina, or just turn tail and run. I thought of apologizing, but without any idea for what. Unfortunately, my speechlessness only encouraged Porcina

At last, Lauren,” I said, casting a look at the poor girl. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, and didn't move from her spot near the door.

“Well

“Really

Porcina scoffed in reply. “I *meant* me and *Lauren*! God! You're so self-centered sometimes!” The switch in her head flipped again, which was as unwelcome as the rest of the situation. Then, in a motion that my mind would interpret as a trap springing shut, she kicked off her slippers and put her legs up on my lap, her bulbous thighs like dungeon restraints made of quivering flesh. Unless I was willing to exert physical effort, I was stuck there at the mercy of a portly prison guard.

Questions were spinning in my head, Lauren would join us on the couch, and I'd have a chance to talk to her. I'll admit, her presence was one of the few things – Porcina's legs aside – keeping me from fleeing into the night, and I was already wondering if my unfavorable circumstances could be turned into something a little more pleasant. As heartless as it was, I found myself pondering ways of spurning Porcina in favor of her roommate, and coming out as a hero in my own tale of triumph.

My quest, Porcina grabbed my hand and squeezed with what was likely meant to be affection. ""I had a really nice time tonight,” she said, staring pointedly into my eyes.

“Yeah

“You can pay me back tomorrow.” She moved as though to touch my face again, then gave me a satisfied smile as she ran her hand down her chest, and then her stomach, before stopping just above her inner thigh. “You must be pretty horny.”

My biological urges threatened to rebel against me yet again, closed the front door and adjourned to the kitchen – quelled any uprising before it could begin. “So,” I asked, not caring if I offended, “those were Lauren's breasts in your advertisement?”

To my surprise, of course they were! Duh! Whose did you *think* they were?""

""Before you flashed me

*That*, didn't you?"" I waited for another switch in personality, but this time, it didn't come. Instead, with an audible grunt and a groan, she pulled her legs from my lap and lurched into a seated position. ""I'm not that *easy*! You still owe me *dinner*!""

""Fine, I'll go find an ATM, *right now*, and pay you back for the hamburger."" Questions be damned, I thought. I had met this girl less than two hours earlier, and I wasn't at all happy with the way that things had turned out. This was supposed to have been a carefree roll in the hay, and instead, well... I knew where she lived. I could visit again later with the excuse of apologizing

I waited for Porcina's response, I'm... I'm sorry,"" she said, holding her face in her hands. ""I must seem pretty fucked up to you, huh?""

I was still guarded and annoyed... but I was curious again,"" I confessed.

""College has been really stressful

""I can understand that."" It didn't do anything to clarify why she had posted a picture of her roommate's breasts, again... why?""

""Why what?"" Porcina asked. 

A moment passed while I waited for her to process my implied question. The silence was filled by sounds of Lauren in the kitchen, “did you post a picture Lauren's breasts instead of your own?"" 

Now, with only the barest hint of a nipple peeking out from atop one of them. It was that tiny exposure, however, of which I had taken note – delusively thinking of myself as I did as an aficionado of the female form – and which had suggested to me that Porcina's breasts were not the ones in the image. For, you see, Lauren's nipples were a light pink, whereas Porcina's were a much darker brown. There as also, the fact that the former woman's breasts were somewhat small and rather perky

When at last I got my answer, waving her hand as though to dismiss any doubts I might have. “The ad was for both of us, but we kept getting old men answering.”

“What do you mean

“She wanted to post an ad, and when translated, it left me with still more questions. Had it been *Lauren's* advertisement all along? I considered making a blind rush to the kitchen and asking her myself, but remembering her look of shame gave me pause. There was, I was certain, a detail missing; something that Porcina wasn't telling me. “Besides,” she suddenly continued. “You like mine better

I was half-expecting to look back and see a lifted sweatshirt, the atmosphere in the room had grown notably colder... not that it had been especially welcoming beforehand.

“I think I'm going to head out, I stood and walked towards the door. “Thanks again for dinner.”

Porcina hefted herself to her feet

Looking back, I'd save myself a lot of trouble in the future... but it would also ruin any chance I might have of getting to speak to Lauren. On the other hand, I knew very little about the smaller girl, aside from her apparently being neat, quiet, and possessing of a phenomenal set of breasts.

“Yes

Hello

A little background on me - I'm currently a college senior, but I can share some EMS ones if people seem interested. This particular tale has to do with the pan-Asian buffet, which will remain unnamed. I prefer prose to greentext, so apologies for the lack of it.

It was a god-awfully busy Friday afternoon, keep in mind... as a restaurant, we had recently opened, and were still gauging how many people we needed to properly staff the place. We'd been dead as a doornail for the past couple of weeks, and the manager had seriously underestimated how busy we were going to be. We were doing our best, and most people understood that, but that didn't stop others from being entirely irate when they had to wait a bit for us to get to them.

Enter into this chaos

Lights dimmed. The earth shook. Our lamps swayed like pendulums from the ceiling, its innocence shattered. He stood at 5'5"" (164cm) and must have weighed in at nearly 400lbs (28.5 stone). Roll upon roll drooped from his frame, loosely held to it by a sweat-stained gray tanktop and dark pair of jeans. Short, receeding black hair lay greased to his head, scraggles of a matching moustache dusting his upper lip. He reeked of sweat and the souls of a thousand untended corpses. 

Our hostess, who seemed oblivious to her disgust because of the sweet aroma of General Tso's wafting in from the food lines. I was darting about my tables at the time, and only heard bits of the conversation.

""CAN YOU SEAT ME CLOSE TO THE BUFFET"" he demanded

""Sorry

""I HAVE BAD KNEES I CANT WALK THAT FAR"" 

They must have gone back and forth for a good ten minutes before he relented and sat at an available table around the corner from the food lines, but no... as a server taking the section closest to the line, it wasn't long before I became the target of his whalesong. 

""HEY WAITRESS"" I heard

""Yes, polite and smiling like a pro. 

""YOU'RE ALL OUT OF SAUCE FOR THE SUSHI"" He didn't bother correcting the ""waitress"" comment

""Oh - I'm sorry about that. Which sauce..."" I stopped when I looked at his plate. It was half a plate with a mound of sushi on it, as it was quite visibly seeping out under the sushi as well. (Spicy mayo is a thick, orange spicy paste as terribly for you as regular mayonnaise, and ten times as tasty.) I almost gagged. I love spicy mayo, but that was too much even for my Asian palate. 

""We - um. We make the spicy mayo ourselves

""WELL YOU TELL THEM TO HURRY UP. SOME PEOPLE GOTTA EAT""

He noticed me staring. Oh god

""WHATRE YOU LOOKIN AT? DONT YOU GET ENOUGH OF THIS AT HOME FROM YOUR MAMA"" 

""...I-I'm sorry...?"" 

He stepped closer. I retched a little

""DONT YOU THINK ABOUT STEALING MY SUSHI. YOUR CHEFS ARE TOO SLOW AND THIS IS ALL I COULD GET. I NEED TO EAT TO KEEP MY STRENGTH UP

I was beta as fuck back then. I ducked my head and apologized, I was there to witness the carnage. He took two plates each visit to the buffet line. Mountains upon mountains of food, dripping noodles and sauces in his wake. There was never enough for the everyone else, and the tables complained and complained about the lack of food. When my section slowed down a couple of hours later, he was still here. I got a chance to peek at his table.

His poor waitress. We'll call her Mia. 

The table was encrusted with food and sauces. Coagulating puddles of Siracha and mayo, and NO SILVERWARE. A full pitcher of orange soda sat next to a large glass of the same. Buffetbane's gut forced him to sit a foot or so back from the table, meaning he had to lean forward to get to his plate. He seemed to be eating with his hand, but no - he had a fork! Its prongs poked out form the pudgy ball of flesh that was his hand, constantly in motion shoveling the food from his plate into his mouth. 

Mia came up to me with a bonafide thousand yard stare. Apparently he'd been hitting on the poor girl. He asked her where she was from, she had to go take care of her tables, she had a boyfriend, etc. He kept going after her. She begged me to take care of the table, since mine were leaving and we were slowing down. She was pretty and sweet, and I wanted to be a gentleman, so I agreed. Plus no one should have to suffer Buffetbane's breath.

Buffetbane was not happy. 

""YER NOT MY WAITRESS"" 

""She had to take care of some things out back

He proceeded to chug the entire pitcher of orange soda

""GIT ME ANOTHER ONE

I looked at him. Down at the pitcher. Back at him. I'd seen him take at least a dozen plates of food already. By this time it was close to three

""Sir

He looked like I'd stolen his last Twinkie.

Unfortunately I have to go to work

TLDR; I, give me advice about how to get a man and be a beautiful plussize modern wommyns. Meeting devolves into her telling me I’m classless and can’t keep a man and me shouting her out of the restaurant. Goddamnit. I'm going to call her HHWSO Or HamHam Wax Studio Owner. 

---
I’m a freelance writer that works with small businesses

I arrive a little after 1pm for our lunch, a bit unkempt and she’s wearing something like this [shirt]( http://media.plussizetech.com/avenue/mm/0334_13432_mm.jpg?wid=271&amp;qlt=95&amp;op_sharpen=1) in I’d say size 32, some rough looking nude leggings plus some super loud red monkey boots with yellow-gold hardware. Oh no no no. No honey, no. She doesn’t know what I look like so she just kind of hurumphs in my direction, nomming on more breadsticks. She wildly gesticulates at the waitress asking “where in the hell” her appetizers are.

&gt;Heeeeeeeeeeeeey. I’m Terpin

&gt;HHWSO: “Really? You took your sweet time. I said to be here at 1:30. If this is the level of professionalism you’re going to display…”

&gt;”Uhhhh yeah

&gt;HHWSO hurumphs more and pulls out an iPad with a Hello Kitty skin on it. “Yeah

I pull out my phone and bring up my notes about what we could do to bring her site up to speed. “So


&gt;HHWSO hurumphs even more. I notice the dozens of Juicy Couture bangles she’s wearing move when her hands glide across her iPad. “In the email you sent me


&gt;I nod


&gt;HHWSO: “Where on my website I am clearly called an ESTHETICIAN. We use ONLY the PROPER AMERICAN SPELLING. THIS IS THE CORE OF MY BRAND.”


&gt;I nod more slowly. “Well, I really think it’s important to show that you’re offering the same great services plus all the stuff that makes you guys so special…”

A waitress appears with 3 plates of appetizers. Everything is stuffed to the gills with other stuff. “Ya’ll enjoy your stuff now!”

&gt;HHWSO grumbles loudly. “Aren’t you going to take her order? She’s been sitting here for five minutes.” 

The waitress is a smaller young woman and her eyes go wide. I’m gonna guess this is her summer job and she’s probably still in high school. “Oh no

&gt;HHWSO grumbles more. “You know what they say about assumptions!”

I tell the waitress I’d like some water, no dessert. Yes, I understand there's a deal for lots of food for 2 people right now, no, I don't want to eat extra. This enrages HHWSO.

&gt;HHWSO: ”You should really eat something. Doesn’t the agency pay for you to do lunches? You should enjoy it.”

&gt;”Uhhhh no. I’m my own boss and I pay for all my own meals and transport and things. They just hook me up with clients like you and whatnot.”

&gt;HHWSO: “Well I’m not going to tell the people I want coming into my STUDIO that I offer European wax services. We play loud rock’n’roll music in my studio and I cater to mostly Baby Boomers who make lots of money and want to try something new with their husbands. You know

Ew. Okay


&gt;”Ohhh

&gt;HHWSO: “We are a WAX STUDIO. We are not a salon. Did you even read the website I sent you? Are you sure you’re the person on the website that’s got good ratings? You know I wrote everything on my website. I know it by heart.”

&gt;Me be nearing my breaking point. Me be getting pissed. Her website looked like a 10 year old on a combined Twinkie acid high wrote it. “Yes, run:flattery.exe.

&gt;HHWSO: “Well thanks!” She stuffs appetizers down her gullet until two plates have been decimated. I slowly begin to realize that she’s a timewaster.

&gt;HHWSO: “You know

&gt;ME BE CRINGIN’. Embarrassed I put a hand over my lip

&gt;HHWSO’s face went crazy. “You want to work with me and you don’t wax? What do you do? You shave? That’s not a permanent solution you know. What does your boyfriend think about you just running wild and ragged all the time? Or do you… swing to the left?”

&gt;Sensitive area to hit. Recently split from husband

&gt;HHWSO’s face screws up. “Well it’s no wonder you don’t have a man! You come down to the studio and we’ll give you a Brazillian and fix your eyebrows and lips up. Being hairless as a bigger girl just makes you feel great. But no freebies! We’re professionals and you have to pay! TEEHEE.”

&gt;Thanks ancient gods of the deep dark underworld that I haven’t had lunch yet. The idea

The nice waitress returns with my plate of gnocchi and my water. She gives HHWSO some kind of huge plate with lots of creamy tortellini on it. I want to look up the points on my Weight Watcher app so bad to see how bad the food is. So bad. Waitress scurries away quickly.

I want to fucking eat

&gt;HHWSO: ”That waitress is sooooo stupid. Back in my day you had to work for your tips but skinny little bitches think that they can just get by with being pretty.""

&gt;""She probably just thought we were splitting the food.""

HHWSO harumphs again. ""But really


&gt;”No, but we’re so busy talking about waxing my ladybusiness and how the waitress is too stupid to bring your apps on time and how I’m too stupid to spell “EST-TET-Tissi-yuN” (she says it like this I swear) that we haven’t talked about your website.”


&gt;HHWSO hurumphs loudly. “Well if this is how you treat your paying customers I don’t know what to say.” She’s still cramming food down her throat


&gt;”You don’t say anything. You’re not a paying customer."" Oh fuck. I just broke Terpin's cardinal rule #1. Don't be rude to the money


&gt;HHWSO: ""Well! I'm a Master Esthetician and I know a thing or two about pleasing clients. You


&gt;""That's totally fine. I'm going now. It’s esthetiSHUN by the way. Like aesthetically pleasing to the eye.” I’m pushing my plate forward, though.


&gt;HHWSO: ”Ooh someone has some of that fancy book learnin’s.” **SHE LICKS HER FINGERS


Oh hell no. I go full alpha ambulatorus on this bitch. 


&gt;**“Well MEBBE I shuld werk out the back of my uncle-brother-daddy’s kitch’n giv’n gerls waxin’ on them wymmmyn parts. ‘JUST HOP ON GIRLS


At this point I’ve dissolved into pure rage. Probably because this HamHam looks a bit like my mother did before she died and used that TONE that mothers use with their children. She grabs her giant SUV sized purse

I sit down


&gt;”Yeah… but I’ll pay for it. She got rude and I lost my shit super bad. I’m so sorry.” I was a waitress at a shitty chain restaurant


Waitress puts up her hands to stop me. “I'm sorry but was that your mama? She was hanging around since like 12:30 eating breadsticks and drinking a soda out her purse.”


&gt;”No! She was a client that wanted me to do her website. She runs the xyz wax studio over off x and x street.”


&gt;Waitress: “I’ve been there my dad gave me a sunless tanning from there for my bday omg it’s SOOOOO dirty.”


I shrugged

I was riding the bus home from work. When I boarded only the back section was full (the back section's deck is raised a few steps

In the back was a group of tourists, hamplanets can be annoying--but they're not mutually reliant so I try not to prejudge. (TOO much.)

As we trundled along

She smiled with thanks and relief. I gestured to socially alert everyone the seat was for Pregnant Lady.

Now. The bus isn't always an easy space to negotiate, and of course the bus itself is in unpredictable motion. So I didn't take immediate notice when I careened forward then felt pressure against my back as I stood. People jam into you on the bus, unintended contact is often made, eh it happens.

But wait -- waaaaait -- something just wasn't quite right.

Pregnant Lady's eyes went huge and she grimaced. Then I was smushed against the seat front before being propelled into the aisle. W.T.F.

I turn around and a hamplanet had plunked into the seat! She was Beyond The Thunderthighs variety, and a strangely disproportionate petite torso floating above. She'd spread as soon as she sat and had poor old dude pinned against the windows.

Pregnant Lady and I are

FantaPlanet (matching orange shirts with her tour group!) was panting and red-faced. She pulled a bottle of soda from her bag and glugged half down, they were killin' me!"" She glanced at Pregnant Lady and did this wink-shrug thing like, she KNEW she'd bogarted the seat but hey, HER CONDUSHIONS OKAY? tee-hee!

My face and Pregnant Lady's face at this registered on the ""So Not Even"" richter scale.

So I said

FantaPlanet

""Maybe someone in your group will give you a seat

She glugged some more liquid blood-sugar-regulator and scowled at me. ""I can't get up the stairs. And I need to sit.""

""More than Pregnant Lady?"" Long

FantaPlanet got even redder and she huffed like a wounded walrus. ""I have a condition! I get short of breath and I can't stand for too long it's too hard on me.""

So I told her to go to the front and tell the driver she needed one of the handicapped-or-impaired seats

FantaPlanet then actually said

Yeaaaaaaah.

No one else was making any moves

There was a short silence, but she did say thanks to me.

A lady with several grocery bags patted Pregnant Lady and said she was getting off soon, we're gonna make it out of this situation alive.

As the bus slowed

""I should have this one instead! It's got more room for... my knees! And I can see out!"" She fucking BEAMED.

I was about ready to throat punch somebody. But, old dude!

After that everything basically reset and went back to normal. That's how it goes. I only had a few more stops, ~~~let it gooooooo.

But nope

At this point I had no face. Just a molten

Pregnant Lady made a noise and I made a noise then it was my stop. As I got off I said to FantaPlanet

&gt; immediately

&gt; says we will do what we can to accommodate.

&gt; they remove armrests from a regular office chair.  he complains that it's uncomfortable.

&gt; sits back and the locking mechanism that keeps the back of the chair  explodes under his weight and he goes crashing to the floor.

This story took place at the second restaurant

&gt;Be me

&gt;Mom set me up as the front clerk. People think it's cute and give me tips even though I'm at the front.

&gt;Mom u so sly.

&gt;Still in training

&gt;Had 6 call-ins with a line waiting before. 

&gt;Gotten a lot better. 

&gt;There are people out there who try to rip me off because they think I'm new and don't know store policies.

&gt;Fuck that. 

&gt;This one lady calls in. It was relatively not busy

&gt;Orders Kung Pao Chicken with white rice, yada yada. Lots of food, thinking it's for a group of people or something. Wants the food to-go. 

&gt;Asks for only one fork. No chopsticks. Tells me to make sure to make it quick

&gt;Holy fuck this shit is all for her.

&gt;Tells me that my mom and her are good friends and usually adds in a free order of dumplings for her.

&gt;I call bullshit. The people my mom gives for free are the people I know personally.

&gt;Never heard of this lady before.

&gt;I tell her we have no such policy

&gt;Lady gets belligerent. Says my mom will be unhappy on how I'm treating her oldest customer.

&gt;Says she's been to our restaurant since it open.

&gt;Says I'm a horrible person for denying her free dumplings.

&gt;Decide to put phone on speaker since my mom is standing next to me

&gt;I still say no.

&gt;Lady bursts into rant how I'm a fucking horrible receptionist that deserves to get fired.

&gt;Says I'm must be a slut who's even working to work minimum wage because I need money to suck more dicks.

&gt;Says she'll be talking to the manager to get my bitch-ass fired.

&gt;I say sure

&gt;By now

&gt;My mom listens through her tirades. Bitch must have the most colorful mouth ever. Calls me all sorts of names. My dad's mouth is a scrunched line. He really hates bitchy customers.

&gt;After lady runs out of breath

&gt;""That is my daughter.""

&gt;Complete and utter silence. Woman mumbles something

&gt;Still surprised she wanted food after all that. Damn she must be hungry.

&gt;Sitting outside to see who this lady is.

&gt;Lo' and behold

&gt;She waddles her way towards the front. Back then

&gt;Woman was so big she was touching the wall and the fucking carved wood with her body. My mom and my dad are in the front. Mom has a poker face. Dad has the biggest frown. Is sharpening a cleaver.

&gt;Can't resist. Walk up to the front desk and hug my mom. Smile at her.

&gt;Lardass's eyes widen a bit.

&gt;""Fucking skinny little chink

&gt;""Teach yer daughter not to be such a little smart-ass

&gt;Is actually trying to give my mom ""advice"" on how to raise me. Maybe an attempt to undo her wrong from earlier?

&gt;Tells her that they're using me as slave labor and not feeding me any shit. Says because of lack of food

&gt;My mom's poker face gets a very dark tone. My dad stares. His stare is scary.

&gt; He follows her out

&gt;He is just standing in front of her car

&gt;Eyes never leave the ball of blubber.

&gt;Lady is in a hurry to leave. Sweating visibly (from my dad or from her fatass lugging the food

&gt;Lady drives so fast and recklessly in order to get out of there

&gt;My dad is cursing the whole time

&gt;Never see her again.


TL;DR

Landwhale wanted free dumplings. Tried to  calls me a bitch and a slut for saying no. Pretty much told colorful versions of me to my mom. Had the audacity to tell my mom how to raise me. Dad scared the fuck out of her with his asian-man-and-sharpening-his-damn-cleaver trick.

On this specific day

Myself and some of the girl scouts were exiting the lounge when I saw this family standing there looking at books.  There was a mom who was VERY LARGE

At this point, and I was feeling generous.  So I went back into the lounge, grabbed a cookie, and brought it out to him.  He lit up and thanked me.  I then went back to organizing books.  

I was on the other side of the shelves they were at and I guess they didn't see me because they all changed.  The mother, plump lady to a devilish hamplanet The mother had apparently grabbed the cookie from the little boy and he had started crying.

**Mother:** Sweety

This little 7 year old kid was a bit chubby

At this point I was angry, she started yelling at me about her blood sugar and her ""condition"".  She then got really up in my face and told me her taxes paid my salary and how I have to do everything that she says because I work at a public library that she finances. She also said that she was going to get me fired.

Since my last installment, she purchased plenty of clothes for when she loses weight, well weight loss never came around and this is what pursued.

&gt;Come back from Britney’s house ( Eris knows we are hanging out

Eris and mom are talking.

&gt;Eris: mom I have gained a lot of weight and it’s not coming off

&gt;Mom: Eris

&gt;Mom: Eris

&gt;Eris: yeah

&gt;Mom: well she and her husband were trying for over a year to have a baby; they went to doctors, and he was able to predict that they would have a son. And guess what, two months later she was pregnant with a baby boy. The world is mysterious place. Science can’t explain everything. (Now mind you Eris and mom were HARDCORE atheists and laughed at me for being religious)

&gt;Debating whether or not I should waste my breath

&gt;Eris: Do you think they help fat people as well?

&gt;Mom: Eris, You ate salad every night, you drank your Gatorade, you did your part. You are a healthy person trapped in a fat person’s body.

&gt;Mom: I’ll call ___ and find the same Psychic she used

&gt;Eris and mom now become members of some online psychic organization. Whatever

&gt;Eris: hey Ares

&gt;Ares: touching our toes. 

&gt;Eris gets pissed off

&gt;Eris: well if you haven’t heard already

&gt;Ares: Go on

&gt;Eris: The Psychic I was talking to is a Doctor, Psychic, and Poet)

&gt;Me: That sounds really deep

&gt;Eris: Shut up

&gt;Me: So you aren’t going to return your clothes

&gt;Eris: If you weren’t so cute you’d be out of this house by now

&gt;Me: you know you could go to the gym 

&gt;Eris: No thanks

&gt;Me: they have dance classes there that might just be your passion

So she agrees to go, but I get a call from a Nekane after they came back.
Supposedly shit went down…

**Nekane’s account of the Event**

&gt;Nekane comes to pick up Eris

&gt;Eris is dressed up as if she is going clubbing, makeup. 

&gt;Nekane tells her that they are going to Zumba and that people don’t dress up for this

&gt;Eris makes nasty comments that Nekane’s family can’t afford to let her wear nice clothes when she goes out. 

&gt;Nekane takes her anyway.

&gt;Eris gets to the class

&gt;During the class she sweats so much that if she doesn’t wipe her face

&gt;Eris starts grinding on the only dude in the class (in fucking ZUMBA) 

&gt;dude gets pissed off and tells her that this isn’t a fucking club and even if it was he isn’t interested in desperate moms.

&gt;Eris runs out crying

[Artist depiction]( http://i.imgur.com/8SgZRKc.jpg) of the event.

&gt;Eris is forever traumatized and will never return to the gym after making a fool of herself.

**Resuming**

&gt;Nekane knows that my house is currently not suitable for life with Eris’s crying so I spend the night at her house (slept in separate beds). Nekane drops me off in the morning

&gt;Eris: someone thinks he is a big pimp

&gt;Me: someone is a desperate mom

&gt;Eris: Look you shouldn’t be friends with Nekane

&gt;Me: Whut

&gt;Eris: All Chinese hate America they always did and always will

&gt;Me: What are you talking about

&gt;Eris: first they bomb Pearl Harbor, and sold nuclear secrets to Russia.

I check her face to see if she is trolling

&gt;Me: okay Eris

&gt;Eris: I don’t judge people because of their heritage

&gt;Me: Are you listening to yourself?

&gt;Eris: There is difference between being friendly with Chinese people and sticking your dick in them.

**Lesson for life**

If you treat people like Eris

""Never argue with stupid people. They will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."" –Mark Twain

&gt;I go to take a shower 

&gt;Come out 5 Missed Calls from Brittany … oh Shit.

&gt;Call Britney

&gt;Turns out that fatso told Brittany that I was sleeping with Nekane

&gt;Plead with Brittany tell her Eris is lying

&gt;Go to confront Eris

&gt;Me: Eris do you enjoy ruining my life

&gt;Eris: Look Brittany is my friend

&gt;Me: I thought you hated her

Me and Eris continue fighting
Brittany believes me but is disappointed I didn’t tell her that I was spending the night at another girl’s house. Which is perfectly understandable.
 I also inform Brittany about Eris’s sexual advances and that she is jealous of me and Brittany’s relationship. Therefore

&gt;I come home in a bad mood so Eris thinks that me and Brittany are having problems

&gt;Skip dinner, speakers muted)

&gt;Eris eventually finishes eating and comes into the room

&gt;Eris: Did things not work out between you and Brittany?

&gt;Ignore her and don’t make eye contact

&gt;Eris comes and sits next to me in the sleeping bag and puts her arm around me

&gt;Eris: look you deserved better than her anyway

&gt;Eris starts to rub my back

&gt;Eris: your muscles are so big

&gt;Eris: how about you sleep in bed with me tonight so you can get your mind off Brittany.

&gt;Phone rings

&gt;Brittany: WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK

&gt;Me: [I told you]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AajslFuPro)

&gt;Brittany: What the fuck

&gt;Me: she wouldn’t believe me anyways

&gt;Brittany: you aren’t sleeping over there anymore what if she rapes you?

&gt;Me: The sacrifices I make just to go to ______ University

&gt;Brittany: Stop joking around I am picking you up right now and you are calling your dad tomorrow that’s final

&gt;Brittany hangs up and picks me up

&gt;I spend the night at Brittany’s house.

Soon enough it was morning

**Note to reader**

The reason I didn’t want to talk to my dad about this was not because it would be awkward or that he wouldn’t believe me. It was that I didn’t him to think that I was complaining. My dad had a rough experience in the military and the problems he faced in a day make all of my problems trivial. He never complained about his hardships so I didn’t think my  ‘touchy’ sister problem warranted his time. 

&gt;I call dad reluctantly

&gt;Explain to him what happened last night

&gt;He sighs

&gt;Me: Dad I know this is hard to believe but

&gt;Before I can finish he cuts me off

&gt;Dad: son I believe you

&gt;Me: I’m confused

&gt;Dad: This isn’t the first time something like this happened. When you and Eris were just little, and both of you would be stigmatized for the rest of your life.

&gt;Dad:  We didn’t want some psychologist labeling you and Eris as having some mental disorder and have you both on medication for the rest of your life. I have seen firsthand what that medication does to people

&gt;Me: Do you still love mom?

&gt;Dad: yes of course I still love your mother

I left the phone pressed to my ear and stood there. 

Motionless.

**TL;DR**

Eris tries to ruin my relationship with me and Brittany. I tell Brittany of Eris’s advances towards me and I inform my father.

Anyway, 70kg) I live in Japan and have lived here for around the past 15 years. When I left the US, it wasn't that bad. Or maybe I was just oblivious, being young and 15kg lighter at the time. Anyway, I live somewhere that considers anything over a BMI of 25 to be quite large. I am not used to encountering whales, and certainly not full out planets. The biggest people I run into regularly are about my size. 

My son was born extremely prematurely. He is extremely small for his age, we had to keep track of certain vitamins and minerals in his food as he would process some correctly, some would spike in his blood and not be filtered out properly, and some he couldn't absorb at all. He is wonderfully healthy now, and we have very little to worry about these days, but the beginning was pretty stressful.

Sorry for the long backstory

When my son was one
Thrilled to potentially have access to cheap baby clothes, honestly concerned that someone might be having some kind of health episode. 
There was a group of women who, and some large plastic cup on the other. One of the others was pushing/leaning on a massive stroller. I am not into staring so just sort of thought ""wow"" and continued on inside. 

(Insert about an hour of amazement at my size clothing being an ""M""

After finding that none of the baby clothes are something I would put on my son even if paid (we don't like Disney, I get ready to leave the baby area. 
The hip-table beast stops me. 
""Yer baby looks so sick. What you feeding him?""
I smile
""Oh my god, and they bring the stroller. I finally see inside. There is a little boy, I have no idea how old. He had so many rolls... Just, so many. His clothes were clearly tight, and puffy rolls were leaking out everywhere. He was laying there in a bed of empty snack packets. Probably twenty of them, maybe more. The mother (?) ruffled through some of them and pulled out one that still had some crackers or cookies or something in it. She tried to hand the packet to my son. I stopped her, because, besides being flat out disgusting and nasty - nutrition concerns and all that. She laughs and says ""Oh

They arrived there the same time I did. I saw them come in... And had already given him a literal pile of snacks. A pile. I was stunned. I again refused, you are starving him. He looks anorexic. What, you so ashamed of your weight that you starve your own kids? That is fucked up."" (Note: I actually don't doubt he did look sickly thin, he actually was at the time.) 

I just turned and walked away. They didn't chase after me.

(insert an old woman coming up and telling me that I was giving my son the gay by dressing him in purple... Not a fun shopping trip.)

When I left

It was just really sad.

It became clear, but rather an incredible desire for food. Our pace – already sluggish on account of my companion's waddling gait – was slowed considerably as she paused at each table we passed, drawing uncomfortable stares from the people whose meals she was ogling.

“Oh

I did my best to react as though she had told a joke. “Heh

“I know

This was news to me. At no point in any of our exchanges – admittedly brief though they had been – had the topic of my subsidizing her meal been discussed. I held my tongue for the moment, it was a continuation of the same off-beat joke, a subtle commentary meant to show her self-awareness.

We finally arrived at our booth, she faced the bench head-on and placed a slipper-clad foot on its surface. For a moment, it looked as though she intended to step up on her seat, but instead, she scooted herself forward until she was kneeling, then turned and squeezed the rest of the way in. The entire performance was over in only a few seconds, leading me to believe that it was very well-rehearsed.

I took my seat in the normal fashion, an act which began as a forced snigger, grew into a self-important guffaw, then descended into what was little more than a staccato hiss from between her teeth.

“You... you don't expect *me* to pay

“Well, but not if you plan on sampling the entire menu.” I did my best to say it casually, as though we were engaging in witty banter. 

To my relief, but decided not to risk the result: Her voice had been exceptionally loud until that point, drawing stares from the same people whose personal space she had previously invaded. It was a welcome change when, without further ceremony, she opened up her menu and began perusing its contents.

Several minutes passed in silence. I decided on an unimpressive hamburger for myself, I had yet to decide if I would be making a hasty exit or accompanying the young woman home, but I wanted to afford myself options for either scenario. Several more minutes passed, punctuated only by a waitress bringing us each a glass of water. Porcina didn't even look up.

“What are you thinking of having?” I asked. This was my attempt at conversation, to my chagrin, that her lips appeared to be silently forming each word that she read. She was clearly literate – after all, she had posted a legible advertisement on Craigslist – but after some careful observation, I could still recognize terms like “deep-fried” and “gravy” being voicelessly pronounced.

At last, almost vulnerable. When she spoke, it was with a high, nasal voice that was reminiscent of a grade school girl. “How much money do you have?”

“Uh, I was carrying only my credit card, but I was unwilling to give her carte blanche. Like flipping a switch, the old Porcina was back, practically shouting her answer.

“Awww, she reached forward and clasped my hand. “I'll tell you what: Tonight, it's my treat, but you won't be getting any.”

“Any what?” I dumbly asked. In response, and a pair of breasts – unencumbered by any undergarments – that decidedly *did not* match the ones pictured in her advertisement.

I was irked... but I was also

“Any more than *that*!” she tittered. “You can take me out again tomorrow and maybe you'll get lucky.”

The rest of the evening progressed in a bit of a haze. Porcina ordered two dinners for herself, eating them with a nauseating mixture of mayonnaise and ketchup. “It's good!” she frequently insisted. “Try it!” Each time, I politely declined. Whenever a member of the staff would approach us, she'd find something to scold them for, only to beam at me adoringly a moment later. It was like watching two separate people inhabit the same body, one of whom was domineering and rude, the other who was incredibly passive and shy.

Throughout the entirety of the meal, and how turned on she was from even mentioning it to me. It was infuriating, both because of the topic at hand and because – despite her appearance, her attitude, her behavior, and her attire – she was my best shot at getting laid that night, and I hated myself for that.

“Did you know

“Fruit?” I asked

“They put this wax stuff on it to get you addicted to it.”

“Oh

She shook her head

“So

“Don't be silly! Of course I eat fruit! I just make sure it's cooked first

“Probably

“*I told you*, “*you're not getting any tonight!*” I sat, dumbfounded, wondering if a concerned patron would call the police. I further mused if it would be better to turn myself in, if only to have an excuse to escape. Before I could say anything, though, Porcina reached out yet again and grasped my hand. “Aw

It was then that I decided: I wouldn't be going home with her, delete her email, block her from my instant messenger, and find someone else to fuck.

If only it had been that simple. True to her word, as well.

A - 5'0 200+lbs of miniature gorilla rapist. Previously known from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1g6r8m/the_tale_of_the_hambeast/) story. Can be extremely charming when he wants to be.

Saddo - A's ex gf of A, everyone else has to be miserable with me.""

As previously stated

The party going out is the Gypsy party (Who steals carts? Gyppos sir!) and yes we've made all those jokes. We are cartoon hollywood gypsies. Think Madam Simza from the second Sherlock Holmes film with RDJ. (Mmmm RDJ). Due to reasons, scout with light armour/axe), Beetus (group trader, is *supposed to be a sly talker* guess who isn't.), A (knife bunny), Gravedigger (Voodoo magic priest) and Saddo (mage, doesn't know the spells and is therefore utterly useless). Carguy is the GM

The party are given their plot

First few encounters go well, they have to use a free talky skill to convince the townspeople to not believe a crazy anti gypsy person (played by me). Beetus has been complaining that he hasn't been able to use his trader skills yet, so we start setting him up for that.

A is not meant to be playing a talky character, and ends up botching everything. A rescues it, and manages to convince a village to sell them some health potions on the cheap, again trying to set it up so Beetus can use his skills and contribute.

&gt;Beetus is sitting on a treestump off to the side.

**""IT'S TOO HOT...CAN'T WE JUST FINISH THIS ANOTHER DAY?""**

""Beetus

**""But I got *assma*

&gt;You ain't run yet

&gt;that's not how asthma works

&gt;'assma'? REALLY?

At this point the ""villagers"" are convinced by mad ranting woman (me) that the gypsies are all scum and ought to be run out of the village. Beetus then rouses himself from his stump, does anyone want to buy an amulet or something?""**

The villagers' faces: [nope](http://img.pandawhale.com/49264-Nope-gif-5cYC.gif)

I get to IC bitch him out, STEALING OUR FOOD AND STINKING UP THE PLACE WITH YOUR UNWASHED SELVES.""

&gt;notice how I didn't have to use my imagination to come up with horrible shit this guy would do.

He *finally* gets the idea that he's meant to move on to the next encounter.  Several more encounters like that, chins and fingers.

&gt;Plays Oceans 11 soundtrack

The plan is simple. The guards walk around in comedically slow and predictable routes. They pretend to hop into the window

This is when Saddo decides to change the plan. Saddo wanders off distracting the guards and ruining their comedically slow routes. She doesn't tell anyone what she's doing, and sending her away. Beetus has spent the entire disaster standing off to the side because **""I have a condition, my assma won't let me hop through the window.""**

&gt;It's an imaginary window.

Beetus chooses this point to inform Saddo exactly how she's overracting. **""Saddo, you should just get over it. That's not a real condition. It's not like we raped you or anything.""**

&gt;We all knew she had been. Beetus was not informed because he's an asshole and nobody likes him.

&gt;We may think Saddo is irritating

&gt;But we would *never* under any circumstances comment about her tragic history like this.

&gt;because we're not insensitive chucklefucks.

Saddo looks like she's about to cry. At this point

&gt;Spouse-a-tron ha missed this whole ordeal by merit of being about 200 feet away in hiding because he thought they were still following ""the plan"".

Beetus's fatrolls jiggle on impact, and both make to swing at Beetus.

&gt;A is a martial arts champion.

&gt;Gravedigger is from the scary land known as Scumbernauld.

Beetus

10 foot drop, and whatever detritus that local NEDS have thrown in.

Beetus flails like a landed whale for about 15 minutes.

**""HELP ME OUT OF HERE. MUH BLOOD SUGAR""**

&gt;[OFW](http://img.pandawhale.com/49264-Nope-gif-5cYC.gif)

Nobody moves.

**""GAUIZ. C'MON

Finally, I WILL SUE. YOU GUIZS ARE ASSHOLES.""**

Everybody is trying to contain giggles

**""THANK GAWD YOU'RE HERE, AND I REJECTED HER.""**

&gt;I had told Spouse-a-tron what Beetus had done in Part VIII.

&gt;Asked Spouse-a-tron NOT to kick his ass.

&gt;Spouse-a-tron knew the truth.

&gt;Spouse-a-tron snaps because this is one of the rare times Beetus had shown his true colours in front of him.

Spouse-a-tron's eye twitches in anger. In the time we've been dating, as a lot of people have seen fit to point out. But today was not a day of calm.

Spouse-a-tron silently just walks up to Beetus, which is making Beetus back up.

Can you guess what's coming?

Beetus backs up to the edge of the ditch, and says ""And don't you ever speak to my girlfriend, or anyone in such a way every again. You haven't seen me angry yet. I suggest you don't push it."" With that he takes one more step towards Beetus, and without thinking, Beetus backs up straight back into the ditch.

We all wander back to see if Saddo is ok. Beetus pulls himself out of the ditch and starts sniffling about **""Beetus

And just wanders off. We don't see him for a few days, he moved out, so we never saw him again.

As an Airman, I've heard, the rolls I've avoided. You see these things and expect to just keep on living, that the next day you'll be all good and dandy. But then one day you wake up, and you realize, they're everywhere. They're not invading, they're already here. The best you can do is try and reason with them and try to help them. These are my stories. My tragedies

These are...The Fat Chronicles.


**Chapter One: The Earliest Ruslting**

&gt;Be the year 2001

&gt;Family decides to take me down to Providence

&gt;Fuck yeah going out of state

&gt;Spend all day walking around finding various things to do

&gt;Dinner time fast approaches

&gt;Find epic restaurant called 'Fire and Ice'

This restaurant is a sort of DIY dinner situation. They have a boatload of meats, toppings, etc. All uncooked. You take a bowl and put everything you want cooked in whatever marinade or sauce you choose. The potential for fatlogic is huge. 

&gt;Unlimited food for 15 dollars.

&gt;[My childhood face](http://i.imgur.com/GyWIlf5.jpg?1)

&gt;With what kid logic I have I make the best pasta bacon chicken beef veggie with Jamaican Jerk wrap ever created. 

&gt;Feeling like a bit of a boss I begin my strut to the chef's counter

&gt;About to arrive when I feel lit

&gt;A massive force pushing me away

&gt;No please

&gt;A massive woman

&gt;Fatness Everdeen looks at me

&gt;[But I was here first!](http://i.imgur.com/z0ZeI.jpg)

&gt;Well too bad

&gt;Whatever.jpg  

&gt;Fatness gives the chef her food. Consisting of three burgers and an entire plate of pasta and assorted beefs.

&gt;Chef asks how she wants all this prepared

&gt;[HFW She want's this all on one burger](http://i.imgur.com/p04dk.jpg)

To give you some perspective

&gt;As the chef is preparing the burger

&gt;""So how about later on you let me cook your meat""

&gt;Chef ignores her.

&gt;""We should go out for dinner and drinks later""

&gt;I'm just thinking......it's 6PM

&gt;Chef says nothing

&gt;Takes about 10 minutes longer than it should have for her food to be finished

&gt;Finally chef get's to my food

&gt;Go back to eat my super wrap.

&gt;Oh no

&gt;As I sit down I smell it...the stench. You know the one.

&gt;Smells like a smoker that hasn't bathed in weeks

&gt;Decide to suck it up and not say anything.

&gt;Completely full after one time up.

&gt;Ate my dinner without much of an issue

&gt;In the time it took me to finish my one wrap

&gt;I'mFull.jpg

&gt;Parents go up for one more round of food and I stay put.

&gt;Since she couldn't keep to herself

&gt; My dad

&gt; [His Reaction](http://imgur.com/iIclWpx)

&gt;Finally

&gt;After we pay and get up to use the bathroom before we go

&gt;I have no face when she's up again with another burger and more pasta.

It has been more than two years since I was in that line of work so I don't have any problems talking about my former clients.



I loved most of my clients. But this one... I literally cried in my car before going into her house to care for her almost every time I saw her (twice a week). She was difficult and disgusting.
We will call her Whalema.



I say Whale also in the sense that she ""wailed"" a lot.



She was 5'9'' 700 lbs. She was bedbound because of her weight, but could take her self to the bathroom a few times a day.



She lived in her mom's basement and made it into her little apartment. She had two fridges and a freezer of her own down there and a bin for her mom to come down and get her dirty dishes. 
She had her bed, bookcase, 3 air purifiers, and a humidfier. 


 

I was there to:




1. Give her a bed bath. You would NOT believe what I would find in her folds... food, hair ties, eye glasses, ketchup packets, personal lubricant bottles, wet wipes/tissues (couldn't tell if they were moist to begin with or if her sweat and yeast MADE them moist) etc. 



2. Do her laundry



She had everything she could ever want/need around her on her bed (which was sunken in like a taco) in pencil boxes with labels on them for remotes, pencils and paper.



She was so scary looking the first time I went downstairs to meet her. She had the beediest little black eyes I have ever seen.
I went to shake her hand. ""Hi. I'm jeanie400...""
""DON'T TOUCH ME! YOU WILL KILL ME WITH THE OUTSIDE SPORES!""
Oh no not one of these...


She was overall good to do the housework for and for how big she was we generally got her bed baths done quickly.
But she would wail ""my water isn't cold enough"" ""turn my oxygen up! I can't breathe from the strong scent of whatever shampoo you use!"" or my favorite ""I gotta get up to pee so go upstairs until I yell that you can come back down again"".


But when I finished work and just had to wait for the dryer to finish



I looked at the books on her bookshelf and talked with her about them. She was so intelligent and had a beautiful immagination! She could have done anything she wanted if she hadn't let food ruin her life. 



The thing that killed about this woman
This woman was recieving disability and medicaid.
She had a husband and a son once. Her husband started making more money and she started to buy
She drove her husband away with her addictino to food and he left her. He died later in a car accident. She used part of his life insurance money to pay for a deep fat fryer at home.


Her son who went to live with an aunt and uncle because she couldn't take care of him; her addicted hindered doing anything for anyone else
Her health quickly declined and the pounds kept adding and adding and one day



She was part of some programs that would drop off food for people on medicaid at her front door. I stocked that food in the fridge according to expiration date and what kind of food it was. She went through it all SO FAST.



Then
Her favorite. After recieving all this good food



I said ""No. The government doesn't pay me to go do that for you and have you pay for it with our tax dollars to make your condition worse. It is against your doctor's orders to eat fast food and I will not assist you with that.""



She yelled and screamed but when I didn't respond she conceded and I made her something that meals on wheels or something brought her.
 (Keep in mind I am 1 of 4 aides that takes care of her)


I wonder if any of the other aides have bought her Carl's Junior.
I talk to her mom about it on my way out one day. 
Her mom tells me that yes



I lose it. I get in my car and call my home office immediately and tell them what I have just learned. Home office called the mom. Mom found out what a serious offense and rule violation this was. 



Mom goes downstairs and scolds Whalema. Whalema calls my company and tries to get me fired.
They tell her they have indeed confirmed that she has been using money she was supposed to be using for her care (not FOOD) to buy herself bad food and bribing aides to do it for her.
She is under revision; they don't know if they can continue to give her care after this



I was now the least favorate aide at my work. Seems most aides have had a few turns with Whalema and gotten some free meals out of it. Whatever.



I hate healthcare assistance fraud. I couldn't handle it. And the prospect of knowing that I could meet and care for someone else that was guilty of fraud because of fatlogic and food addciction made me leave the industry.

Before we begin, 250lbs, not fat but not skinny). My brother was a highschool football star and a wrestler until he blew out his knee (6'3"", 225 lbs of ""twisted steel"" as he says). My mom was a little thing, 5'6"" and I don't think I've ever seen her weigh more than 120lbs until she hit her 50's. Add me, the baby, and my older sister, and you have a lower-class family of five. 

Me being the youngest.  

In my family, first served.   

I was never fat.  

None of us were

Food eventually meant more to me than gold.  

**Enter Tubbs.**  

She was a friend of mine in high school, yeah baby.) Tubbs was short. Ridiculously short to me, at 5'4"", and weighing in at a whopping 275 throughout high school. She always complained that ""her parents were poor,"" blah blah blah, couldn't buy her CDs and other things she wanted. I took it with a grain of salt because I thought, in my ignorance

Never explored the subject.    

Fast forward to my post-high school years. I opted out of college and decided to branch out into the wonderful world of factory work. Shit pay for a very physically demanding job, and I had my own little apartment in town, a fifteen minute walk from my job.  

Aight.  

But, offers to move in. I'm all for it. I even set her up with a job where I work because my bosses love me so much they ignore her obesity and hire her on the spot (To be fair, she had dropped 75lbs and was, at the time, a much smaller 200lbs. I bullshitted them into thinking she could do it.)

The apartment, however, was ENORMOUS. So she set up shop out there, with a divider blocking the view of her bed from the rest of the room, using the decent-size storage closet to keep her dresser and personal things in. We split every expense, right down to cost of food.  

A month goes by. Tubbs can't keep up at work. Backaches are common in that line of work, which my employers enforced strictly) Not Tubbs. Backaches every single day, headaches, complaining that she's going to have the plant shut down because of ""unsafe work conditions"", blah blah blah.  

*smh.*  

Eventually I end up doing the work of two people for half the day, fuck yeah). I have funny work stories, but this isn't the time.  

Anyhoo.  

I soon notice that Tubbs is gaining weight. I also notice that the food in my apartment is disappearing

I also notice that she has less and less money every week to give me for bills. 

Where the fuck is all my food?  

I talk to Tubbs. Guess what she replies?  

&gt;I didn't eat none, nothin' but salads. Blah blah blah.  

Salads smothered in ranch, and cheese (ain't knocking bacon, LOVE me some bacon, but a whole pound for a salad is fucking ridiculous). I've seen this firsthand. Fatlogic is awesome.  

As more time goes by, if she isn't eating it, she's letting other people eat my food.  

Homie don't fucking play that shit.  

My relationship with this monstrous thorn proceeded to deteriorate until I could no longer stand being in the same room with her.  I started hiding the things I wanted for myself in my closet so that I could eat them when I wanted to. She knew I was hiding food

&gt;Teehee

**Bitch

Tubby McFatass is going out with her ""boyfriend"" one night. I honestly don't think the guy knew he was her boyfriend. I should've asked him about it. He invites me

&gt;Don't clean my area

I've never even seen this guy hold her hand. But she has an answer for everything. One night she tells me:  

&gt;We don't believe in PDA. Do all our lovin' in the bedroom.  

I sleep 30ft away from her. If somebody was in my apartment

But oh God

I'm still single after my breakup with He Of Whom We Do Not Speak

&gt;You need to put on some weight, A, I'm worried about you. We'll talk about your eating disorder when I come back from my date. Try not to puke or anything. 

I wasn't even that fucking skinny. My job (and the additional load of doing hers for her) bulked me up to a good 165 from all the heavy lifting and I absolutely loved myself

Bitch

Either way. The Hamplanet is out with her ""boyfriend"" and I venture out into the living room to clean. I rarely entered that room because i considered it hers

I opened the door.  

I looked around.  

**Dear GOD

She had garbage. Garbage everywhere. Bags that hadn't been taken down to the dumpster, made by maybe three people, just strewn about my living room. (notice how I get territorial)

&gt;I'm not waiting for this bitch to clean
 
I clean the living room

Feeling victorious

They're gone. The cupboard is empty.  

I open the neighboring cupboard.  

Empty.  I check the fridge

Barely a scrap of food to be found in the place.  

All that remains of the $200 I bought in groceries **TWO WEEKS** ago

**WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.**  

I'm seething. I stomp out to my closet for my hidden reserve of cereal bars. I'll bitch at her later. I open the door

Only to find that EVERYTHING I had hidden is gone.  

Every. Single. Fucking. THING. 

I stagger out into the living room and drop to the couch, to last me easily three months.  

It's all gone.  

Then I smell something.  

It's not quite mold, and it leads me to her closet.  

*Dear lord

My fingers trembling

And almost pass out.  

Let me paint you a picture. Empty butter containers repurposed for easy shoveling, grease soaked through to the wood floor. Moldy mac n cheese scattered about on the floorboards. Full bowls of MY cereal, complete with rancid, curdled milk, abandoned on her dresser. On shelves. Everywhere. Cups of kool-aid, milk, and tea lying unfinished and growing new life. Mold. Mold all around me. . I begin to notice plates of things I **can't identify**. Piles and piles. On the floor. On her dresser.  

**IN HER DRESSER.**  

Then I notice the bottles of piss. Apparently, then left it in the corner. On the floor. On. The. Fucking. FLOOR. 

**OPEN.**

My gag reflex cries out in agony and I vomit. Vomit everywhere. A flood of vomit. There were no survivors.  

This bitch has been stealing my food. Snarfing it in the living room in the middle of the night or whenever she had the chance

As I wipe the vomit from my chin

&gt;Wh-what are you doing in my room?! I told you I'd clean it! GET OUT OF MY ROOM! 

Then she notices her closet door is open. Time itself stands still in preparation of my unbridled rage. I'm not proud of what I said next.  

&gt;You DISGUSTING. Fucking. PIG. Your FAT FUCKING ASS has been STEALING MY FOOD

Dramatic arm flailing. Tubbs actually tries to interject.  

&gt;You don't understand

&gt;No. NO. SHUT UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW. So help me god. Get the fuck out. Get out right now. Get the fuck out of my sight

I'm too pissed to revel in my glory. Her ""Boyfriend"" is staring into the closet in disgust. My last words to that kid were beautiful.  

&gt;PLEASE tell me you're not fucking that monstrosity.  

**Tubbs left that night and never came back. I called the landlord immediately to come over and see the damage. I told him I'd clean it if he knocked the cost off of my rent, she's living three towns over.**  

  
**Sorry it's so long!**

&gt;I'm tasting that guy for days. 


&gt;I will never be clean again. 

So that's my story, get into middle age and it will catch up with you hard and fast. I transported lots of people who were old before their time because of obesity, alcoholism or meth. 400 pounds at 25 is bad 400 pounds at 45 is deadly. At some point you will end up doing permanent damage to your liver pancreas and joints. A large number of obese people who use mobility scooters really are permanently disabled, they have osteoarthritis caused by excess wight, or poor circulation caused by diabetes. If that gets bad enough you go blind and the doctor saws your foot off. At this point, it's kind of too late, so if you were thinking of losing weight right now is a great time to start. Fat logic is a trap, some choices give us a good chance to meet our grandchildren and live a long and healthy life
&lt;/Lecture&gt;

A side story, ""Why can't they have scanners for normal people"" was a common refrain. We refereed to these calls as ""Visiting Marine World"" Sometimes even the larger MRI scanner wasn't big enough. An ER doc once told me about a patent who could not breathe when flat on his back. They apparently had to exploratory surgery to diagnose him.

**Chapter Six**

Morning dawned as it usually did in those days, in a heartbeat, I sprang to alertness, my heart pounding as I realized that it *hadn't* been a dream. Porcina was very real... as was her roommate, Lauren.

Lauren. I had seen a side of her – admittedly without her permission – that spelled hope for me in a way that nothing else in recent memory had. Lauren, I hadn't thought that far ahead yet. Still, the end result would undoubtedly be glorious! It was only a question of how and when I would win her affections.

Rather than rushing headlong into the unknown, checking my email and any webcomics that I read. (Nowadays, I've added Reddit to my repertoire.) There were no new messages aside from the usual spam, which crushed a fledgling fantasy of finding a letter from Porcina's roommate. I toyed with the idea of signing into my instant messenger, but decided against it, lest I be electronically accosted by the avatar for delusional seduction. As I sat there, however

Lauren, with one location very close to the college. Saturday seemed a likely enough time for a full-time student to be working, so with a little bit of luck, I might have an opportunity for a one-on-one meeting. If she wasn't working, I could always return to the townhouse with the claim that I was taking both women out to brunch. I would pay my debt to Porcina, and have the chance to be on my best behavior for Lauren.

I excitedly dressed and showered, and irritated with her roommate for effectively stealing her date. My worst-case scenario involved Lauren refusing to speak to me out of some sense of honor for her roommate's new love interest. I prepared for every eventuality, deciding to the last detail how I would contend with any complications. Finally, suitably prepared for my adventure, I left the house with a spring in my step and set my sights towards my goal.

The bookstore was quite crowded, I had been picturing a quaint little shop, stacked floor-to-ceiling with leather-bound tomes, all watched over by a tiny girl in horn-rimmed spectacles. (Lauren had not been wearing glasses when I met her, nor had any been in evidence in her pictures. Such is the way of imagination though, I suppose.) Instead, I was presented with a bustling hub of bestsellers and popular fiction, if she was even working that day.

In the end

“*Oh my god what are you doing here?!*” squealed a delighted voice. I turned just in time to be crushed by a wrecking ball

“Yeah, unwelcome... *unearthly* bad luck, really. My mind still reeling, I fought to think of an excuse for my presence. “I, uh... I needed to buy a book,” I lamely offered. “What are *you* doing here?”

“Oh

I smiled and waved back

Lauren responded by mouthing

Before I could try again

“That's... really nice of you, though? A meal and a drink should cover the cost of a burger, right?” I directed my last words towards Lauren, who had fallen in step beside us. She opened her mouth as if to answer, but was interrupted by her roommate.

“No-no-no-no-no! We don't *have* to pay! Lauren gets free food!”

I looked to Lauren to verify this, and Lauren can get her own.”

Porcina, save your money! You're so *poor*! Besides, you have to buy me dinner tonight!”

Such was how I found myself being treated – though I use that word loosely, and biscotti with the flavor of cardboard. There were egg-and-sausage sandwiches available, too, but I declined, citing – with the truth, for once – that I didn't much like eggs. (Nor, I did not say, who reassured me that she'd eat mine for me. Lauren

“So

“I thought we decided on the same place?” I replied. Though I didn't relish the idea of paying for her to inhale two full-sized entrees, turning my attention to Lauren, “maybe you would like to join us? When do you get off work?”

“*She can't come*!” Porcina bleated. As I had come to expect, *Laaaaaauren*?” Without waiting for a reply, Porcina reached out, grabbed my knee, and launched into another sing-song sentence. “Besides, *yooooou* don't want to see *heeeeeer* boobs again!”

I glanced at Lauren, and shook her head... though she seemed far less ashamed than she had the night before. She was uncomfortable, no question... but her embarrassment seemed almost to be for Porcina's benefit, rather than her own. I was *dying* to talk to her alone by then... and as if on cue, she gave me the chance.

“I'll help you find your book

For a moment, giving me a little finger-wave. I took the opportunity to excuse myself without any further hesitation, standing and following Lauren deeper into the store.

“Thanks

“No problem

“No

“It's *just* a *book*, it occurred to me that I was being led away from the cafe... but that I had never mentioned *what* book I had come to buy. We walked down an aisle of art books and poetry, and wound up in a tight corner at the back of the store. “Okay,” Lauren said. “What were you saying?”

“I wanted to apologize for last night, I asked “Why are we back here?”

“Nobody comes back here but art students

That made sense. “Look, and although I couldn't quite define why, I wanted to be *completely honest* with this girl. In other, similar circumstances – when faced with a  girl to whom I was attracted – I had always gone out of my way to be charming, even if it meant lying through my teeth. This time, though, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Lauren was beautiful, in a strange way

I took a deep breath and started again. “Last night, I'm sorry.”

Lauren looked at me with a skeptical gaze. Then, so full of life, so wholly and completely pure! Her laughter was like a forgotten song from childhood, the accompaniment to a first kiss, a sound of such potent happiness that it almost brought me to tears!

… And, fearful as I was that she was laughing at *me*.

“Oh, taking a calming breath. “Heh. No, that's... heh, that's not what happened *at all*.”

Firstly, including one that is so incredible, so absurd that I don’t have the physical strength to type it up or even do it justice. If I drum up interest, I may be coaxed to share it later on. This is a different, jimmy-rustlin’, rage inducin’ story about how I became slightly racist and outed myself at the same (fun times!). Part 1, at least.


Warning: This might be considered a long one. I find myself loving the long


Background on me at the time of incidents: 18 yr old college student in midwest Michigan at my first job stocking shelves at a chain of supermarkets in a college town on 3rd shift. At the time I was quite in shape, gay-but-you-wouldn’t-notice, and not out (all will become relevant). 


Background on the area: The magical part of Michigan in which I lived was a bona fide breeding place of hamplanets of the most despicable, I was related to a number of them). They were smelly, entitled, and invariably draped in camo print anything, as was nearly everyone in that part of the state. I was raised by the greatest parents in the word, and prior to entering college never thought much about fat people or those of other ethnicities—they were all around and I just wasn’t raised to hate anyone.


My previous experience with African-American folk consisted of well dressed, I was sheltered. Surely the stereotypes that I saw on TV and heard about in awful jokes were just legends! Surely “ratchety” black ladies were just some mean caricature! Oh, the naiveté! Upon entering college (where I was, for the first time, surrounded by my darker brothers and sisters) and getting a job, my perspectives on the world changed drastically, and I was never the same…


&gt;Be me


&gt;Be stocking my usual aisle, doing great, slingin’ dat product onto dat shelf


&gt;A faint tremor rocks the shelves


&gt;Lo


&gt;This cannot be! I feel… a pull. Babies begin to cry, warning that something foul draws near!


&gt;Then I hear it


&gt;The florescent lights above my aisle flicker and sway


&gt;No… not beasts—~~the largest black woman I have ever beheld and her friends~~ Lardquisha and the Moons!


&gt;Lardquisha, complete with shiny pink, skin tight “wrapper” walks past my aisle, addressing my petite and innocent coworker (who we’ll call Tiff, or T) cowering behind an end cap in a voice that may only be justifiably likened to the devil scraping his pitchfork against a blackboard mingled with the death throes of Dave Chappelle after swallowing a housecat


&gt;”YO BITCH! Where da pop at? Momma gawt low bluuuuhhhhhhd shugah and I be DAYUMED if yew see MY ass up in hear passin’ out allova DIS nasty-ayuss flo cuz bitches don’ be puttin’ da pop up frunt!” (flo = floor

&gt;Cue moons squawking affirmatively 


&gt;“Yeeeeeeeeeyuuuuuuh!” “Tellum guuuurl!”


&gt;Cue chorus of cackling


&gt;OMG they really showed that innocent


&gt;Cue very first conscious sensation of fathate


&gt;Cue very first conscious sensation of racism


&gt;Lardquisha and the moons trundle towards the front of the store


&gt;T shoots a lingering


&gt;Their conversation turns to Lardquisha’s “thighroid” acting up because the Taco Bell they had just inhaled didn’t have any “shugah” in it


&gt;Moon #1 had told Lardquisha that’s what she get for drinkin dat diet Pepsi instead of making the “hell-ty” choice (of normal Pepsi


&gt;[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/w6bJj.gif)


These initial impressions were only the start of the rustling de jimmies; at this point I was nauseated, had designed the floor plan to the store herself, thereby keeping Lardquisha’s thighroid in a less-than-healthy state), but mostly laughing to myself. 


Let me pause here to explain a few details essential to understanding my personal encounter with Lardquisha that followed shortly. My aisle consisted of condiments and jars of pickles/olives on one side, which I had set on the floor near the shelves on which they would eventually be put. Minutes after T’s terrifying encounter, I unloaded a new cart on the floor. Cases of product were now stacked neatly against the side of the aisles, leaving plenty of room for late night shoppers to walk down the aisle. At least for MOST late night shoppers…


I will write part 2 tomorrow if any interest because its bed time. I would appreciate comments on my writing, if the public demands it! 


PS I realize it isn’t thighroid

TL;DR The dark chocolate braised hambeast Lardquisha and her moons crash into my store looking for liquid beetus due to sugar-lackin' thyroid. Berate the nicest girl I've ever known for not having ""curves"" and for the fact that the pop aisle isn't near the front--even though it is.

This just happened a couple of weeks ago. I have a coworker (let’s call her Moose) who is extraordinarily fat. Definitely fits the definition of morbidly obese. 5’3 350+ pounds. (Just for reference, when I first met her, really my schema for obese people had been shaped by FPS, and I was expecting the worst. I was wrong. She turned out to be a lovely, pleasant person. She didn’t steal others’ food (though ate a SHITTON of her own every day) and didn’t express any fatlogic that I could tell. 

I am a biology major and work in my department’s main office as an assistant. Basically, I spend a great deal of time on reddit, particularly FPS, though I always made sure Moose never saw because I didn’t want to offend her. As you can probably guess, one day she caught me. 

As I assumed, and even started reading these stories with me. However, one day, she came to work and asked, “shadowcat, have you ever heard of This is Thin Privilege?” 

I replied, and I agree with a lot of what they say (fat people shouldn’t have a broken bone ignored because they’re fat or be subject to harassment on a daily basis, etc.) but some of the things they say really bother me. Like the idea that obesity is genetic.”

Now, shadowcat, I’ve been reading TiTP and they have solid evidence that genetics is 77% of obesity.”

My jaw dropped. “OK

Moose: “Oh

Now, so if you don’t believe in evolution my argument will seem like crap)

“Let’s say it is genetic. This would mean that the genetic makeup of the population (with regards to obesity) has changed drastically in the last 20 years. There’s only a few ways that could happen.

1)	Non-random mating. Basically fat people pair up and have WAY more babies than thin people

2)	A ton of thin people are fleeing the country and a ton of fat people have come in to the country. NOPEROO!

3)	The population went from a ton of people to a very small number of people due to war

4)	Natural selection occurred. This basically means that fat people are more likely to reproduce than thin people

5)	Mutations occurred in the gene pool. This can’t have happened! Say a mutation in the (supposed) “fat” gene occurred that caused people to gain weight. In order for it to take hold in the population

Also, much less 16.”

Moose said, and so it MUST be genetics! Big bones just run in my family!”

I couldn’t think of anything to say. I didn’t want to offend her by informing her that the 2000 calories she eats for lunch alone every day weren’t helping

Finally, I disagree with you. But if you wanted to try dieting and exercising, I could help you with creating healthy meals and I’d be happy to exercise with you!”

Moose: “No shadowcat, she stomped back to her desk and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the day.

Please help me! I want her to be a great F2F story, please do so.

On road with bus hambeast prime tells me what it is to be a real 


Asian

end of bus ride causing many to lose their lunch.


Cast of Characters


Me: half white half Asian girl. Apparently I’m not truly Japanese 
because I don’t eat Japanese junk food and choose to make my own instead


Friend A: Sara cool girl and works on anime club committee. While not on the actual officer list she might as well should be.


Friend B: May only other Asian and president of animu club. Has lost faith in club because majority of members do nothing. 


Boyfriend of Friend B: Otto cool Asian guy with the most unasian name I’ve ever heard.


Hambeast Prime: Hp large girl with many a problems. Shits herself in public on bus ride


Let the story being.


&gt;Arriving at hotel and unpack goods. I managed to score a room with my two friends (Hell yes). While the school doesn’t allow drinking I plan on getting wasted.


&gt;Turns out Hp did NOT pay the mandatory $100 fee and instead expected us to pay for her. All our rage and we can’t send her back to school because of how much it would cost. So we have to bear with it for now. 


&gt;Club advisor goes from Beta to Alpha in a second and says she is staying in our room with us.
Goddammit.wmv


&gt;She squees that she can stay with the only other Asian and in the same bed.


&gt;May gives her a warning that she is either sleeping alone or with boyfriend (haha)


&gt;HP gets angry at this and calls her a lesbo and storms off to room without the key. 


&gt;We get key and see her waiting infront of the room with all her luggage.


&gt;howdidshegetthose.fla


&gt;Enter room and claim and plop on bed. Feel cases slam on me and lose breath.


&gt;”whoops sorry. Didn’t see you there! I guess you are too thin! Teehee”


Wannagohulk.now


&gt;Say just watch it next time and that I claimed the bed. HP gets angry and takes her stuff off.


&gt;See May already claimed the other bed. Sara agrees to sleep with me because we don’t want to hear HP bitch and moan.


&gt;HP grunts and walks off to the bathroom. 


&gt;I unload my bag and my friends do the same. I plan on cosplay as “Mew” from Jet Set Radio [Girl in Blue is Mew]( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbmhqfuWPr1qmd4syo1_500.jpg) Friends plan on cosplaying as the girls on left and right. (Sara is black) and May’s boyfriend is going to be crossing dressing as the kinda goth looking girl


&gt;We prepare everything. Lay out costumes for tomorrow. Its currently 9pmish and we are hungry. I pull out phone and look for a café or something.


&gt;Hp pops out of bathroom. Wearing.. some.. kind of obviously dead animal. I think. It was extremely tight on her body


&gt;We keep looking and eventually just order a pizza. May notices something outside of window. Restaurants behind con center? Nope. Just a red light district. 


&gt;Pizza comes and Hp BEGS to eat some. As she is incredibly hungry. I ask her what happened to her huge bucket of ramen. She tells me she ate it all.


&gt;I tell her that eating a huge bucket of ramen isn’t healthy


&gt;She made that bucket with 30 packs of ramen. 15. Fucking. Packs. 15 servings.


&gt;Remember when I was a hambeast used to eat it nonstop. 1 package of Ramen is around 480 calories (550 with flavor pack) and she had 15 servings. 15 x 550 = 8250 calories


&gt;I honestly am shocked at this point. I have a single slice of pizza and just give her the rest. My friends are a bit peeved… but then there is a knock on the door.


&gt;May runs to door and opens it. It’s her boyfriend. They hug


&gt;With food in mouth Hp prime squeels like a piggy and says “A REAL LIVE JAPANESE MAN” wut.


&gt;She rushes over and tries talking in Japanese. He is a bit offended but just kinda shrugs it off. (She spoke jibberish)


&gt;Sara introduces him to Hp. May is too busy trying to think of ways to keep Hp away from him. He shows me his costume and make-up for the character he plans on cosplaying and I give him a thumbs up.


&gt;Hp doesn’t know what we are talking about. We just laugh it off


&gt;Pretty awake after bus ride because of sleeping and decide to walk around hotel. (Nice hotel. Hilton hotel that is connected to concenter.) Looking around and notice gym.


&gt;I fist pump because now I can go running after eating. 


&gt;Hp pats me on the back REALLY hard. I almost fall over. I ask her what does she want and why did she follow me.


&gt;She tells me to stay away from Otto and that he’s hers. I am a bit stunned by this because Sara introduced him as May’s boyfriend. Hp says that doesn’t matter because all Japanese men love “MUH CURVES”


&gt;She waddles away and I’m just stunned. Afraid of grease being on the back of my shirt.


&gt;I return to room and everyone seems fine. Otto is passed out on bed. May is reading


&gt;Hp comes in and asks us what the hell are we doing? We are at a con we should be getting wasted. While a good idea I wouldn’t do it with HER around.


&gt;Hp keeps insisting on it and we are a bit hesitant. Hp wants to go to red light district


&gt;Hp whines and whines some more talking about how she wants to dance and stuff. This does not shift our opinion on the matter.


&gt;Hp stomps off and back to the couch. Otto just laughs because he heard everything. Hp just says “Otto would love to see me dance” Otto tells her immediately hell no


&gt;As I keep drawing on my pad Hp just goes around asking everyone questions and while not annoying is getting a bit bothersome. She keeps asking Otto and May about Japanese culture and stuff. Otto has been in America his whole life


&gt;I finish my drawing and slip my sketchbook back in my bag. I lay on the bed and look over at Sara who fell asleep at the keyboard. I decide to take out my kindle and read. (I will finish Lord of the Rings one day. I promise) 


&gt;Hp begins pestering me about how we should “mess” with Sara. Sara is NOT a morning person


&gt;Hp just huffs and goes on her laptop. Without headphones we can hear her watching yaoi. (For those that don’t know Yaoi is romance anime between two men. Yuri is for romance anime between two women) Ask her to put on headphones or mute because she is playing it REALLY loud and its really late.


&gt;Hp just gets salty with me and says “I should appreciate” her doing this. So I try to change topic and ask Hp if she is going to cosplay. She says she will cosplay (Predictably) as Miku. Now hear me out here. I like anime


&gt;She shows me the costume and its small.. like REALLY small. As in I would barely be able to fit into it


&gt;Its 1am by this point and I want to sleep. I see Sara woke up for a second and put her laptop away


&gt;I say I’m going to sleep and I turn off the lights.


&gt;”Uh. Please don’t do that. Its rude!” Hp pretty much shouts at me.


&gt;Turns out Hp is afraid of the dark and says I tease her with my thin privilege. Wat. (I honestly reached over to turn off the lights)


&gt;I ask her how old she is and how can she be afraid of the dark. She tells me she is 36. ಠ_ಠ


&gt;This girl is 36 years old.. doesn’t have a job.. in community college.. wat


&gt;I sigh and dim the light instead of turning it off. I fall asleep pretty easily but it still kinda bugs me.


&gt; I wake up ready for the next day and equip my clothing as I get ready to go out as Mew. Examining it I see no problems with it


&gt;I open my phone and see I have a new text message. A lot of them actually. 54 to be exact all from the same number. Turns  out HP got my Cell number and was just sending me text messages saying “You are so underweight” or “You should gain weight you look terrible” and my favorite “Stop using your thin privilege all the time. You need to be sensitive to other people!”


&gt;I just ignore them and get ready as my friends all wake up from their sleep. HP doesn’t stir for a while so we leave without her and leave her a note. The TRUE con adventure begins.


Will HP behave herself AT the con

Here's the thing about LS, as miserable and tired as this guy looked. 

LS liked me, but she never got the hint.

Back to the story, and though Adolf seemed appeased with my excuse to leave, she still told me she would not accept any lab results from me that were not complete due to my absence. (I should clarify that though my group of four did the lab together, we still we required to turn in our own reports and data interpretations and graphs)
I asked the group if they would email me the remaining data that I missed

Now it's later that day,  (to this day I don't know how she got my dorm room phone number) 
""Hey MP3Hoarder, I was in fear that shed try to see if she could come over, go out to eat, etc. "" ok, try to send of now."" A few minutes pass, and I see several emails from her pop up. ""I see them, thanks. Well I guess I'll see you later."" 
""Wait MP3Hoarder!! Wellll? What do you think? Hmmm?""

""Ok, 2, etc) thanks for the emails, I got to go.""

A few days pass and it's Monday night, and it's a slow night . Our awesome boss lets us ""hard working starving college students"" work on homework if its a slow day. I decide to start on my lab report, I'm expecting no higher than a c anyway, as are all the students in the lab. I open up my email and try to open ""here's what you missed 1"" but it won't open for some reason, and a popup asking for the  administrators password prompts me. I asked awesomeboss (AB) if she could help me. She's sitting right next to me. (She's a 5'5 50 something bible thumping year old woman whose as sweet as can be until you were a dinner or sinned in her presence.)

She gets on my computer as I stand behind her as she puts in her password. The email opens and I froze.... The email had pictures of LS front, I felt my balls scream and retreat into my body. The library has a strict no pornography on the computers, one guy got canned cause he had a thing for grabbing himself looking at porn at the circulation desk. 

AB goes dead quiet
""AB

The whole time the emails open

AB, I I don't know what's going on.

Quietly AB tells me

"" I I I don't know what's happening

An opens the other emails listed ""here's what you missed"" and thankfully instead of more pictures of LS resembling a manatee

To make this short, and that she was gonna pray long and hard to try and forget the naked pictures she saw. (If I could've I wouldn't bleached my brain and scrubbed those memories away.) 

The next day I went to lab and LS cornered me with her bulk. ""I know you saw those pictures

""They gave me nightmares, and probably would've turned me gay if I looked at them longer.""

I quietly vented my feelings ""I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU

LS ended up changing to another lab period thankfully

&gt;Wait a second... Are those luggage bags?

HI I'M BBC!! (BBC = Bipedal Ball of Cheese)

&gt;Why does BBC have luggage bags?

 I'M YOUR NEW ROOMIE

&gt;Nicderp: This is our new roomie!

&gt;MFW BBC is gonna be sleeping above me

&gt;BBC is 5'4"" and 300 lbs of round cheeks

&gt;She wears these nasty little cotton boot slippers

&gt;They used to be pink

&gt;She takes them off

&gt;No socks

&gt;Feet are streaked with brown dirt

&gt;AND THE SMELL OH GOD THE SMELL

&gt;Their crushed soles from her weight resemble my soul after just a week of sharing space with this monstrosity

&gt;She puts the ""boots"" by the foot of our stacked beds...

&gt;...Right by my pillow...

&gt;I can hardly stand the smell wide awake....

&gt;What's the weight limit on these beds?

&gt; What is my fate once night falls?

It's not that I didn't like BBC. It's that the room is really made for 3 people

&gt;BBC hangs up 1D posters all over the top of our bunked beds.

&gt;She plays the music out loud on her laptop every waking minute of the day.

&gt;She's a huge (lol) fan of tumblr and HAES blogs

&gt;And one of those luggage bags

&gt;Cheetos. Doritos. Cheese curls. Fritos. Lays chips. Devil dogs. Fucking everything.

&gt;Crumbs all over my side of the room. Coolmate eventually questions out loud.

&gt;Coolmate: LadyTron

&gt;I tell Coolmate to stay up until BBC comes in at night if she wanted to find out.

&gt;BBC comes in late one friday

&gt;Bed squeals and shakes. Boards under the bed sag. I hear the springs stressing.

&gt;I hear a muffled crinkle

&gt;Just BBC and her late night feeding

&gt;Something falls past the foot of my bed

&gt;She throws the packaging of her food in the corner of the room where the beds meet the wall

&gt;Text from Coolmate: oh my god. I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

&gt;A nice breeze of BBC's disgusting slipper boots waftes into my nostrils

&gt;I politely engage in the conversation.

&gt;I just cannot relate on any level with this girl

&gt;Doesn't mean I can't be nice.

&gt;Somehow the topic turns to shoes.

I NEED NEW SHOES! THESE ONES ARE SO OLD AND STINKY ^(teehee)

&gt;Before I can stop myself: ""If you do get new ones

SOCKS? LAST LONGER?

&gt;Me: Yeah. Your shoes are absorbing the sweat on your feet. And your feet touch the dirty ground. Socks will absorb the dirty sweat instead and help your shoes stop smel--

I CAN'T WEAR SOX ME AFRAID OF COTTON

&gt;What

I HAVE A PATHOLOGICAL FEAR OF COTTON ONE TIME MY FRIEND CHASED ME AROUND THE HOUES WIT A BAG OF COTTUN BALL AND I WAS SCREEMIN IT WAS SO FUNEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW

&gt;Wait didn't I see this somewhere...

&gt;There was a TV program of this. I'm certain of it. I don't tell this to BBC though

&gt;Me: So uh

She goes on and on about how much she hates it

You see, we were able to keep our standard of living high, even though we were living in a freshman dorm.

With BBC, trash at the foot of the bed, or her disgusting shoes. This caused me a lot of stress. And in times of high stress, my patience goes down exponentially.

&gt;Finally it pops into my head where I saw that cotton [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbn6In9aSGo).

&gt;Me: Alright. You're not afraid of cotton.

WUH? YIS I AM

&gt;Me: No you're not. That T-shirt you're wearing is cotton. Those slipper-boots are most likely a poly-cotton blend. Those sheets you sleep on are most likely made of cotton.

A stunned silence. I can see the defeat in her eyes. If I wasn't so goddamn tired from those fucking shoes and late night CRAWNCH CRAWNCH I probably would have felt bad for her.

&gt;Me: Those shoes smell terrible. And I resent the fact that I'm the only one that has to deal with sleeping with them right by my face. They belong either in bed with you

&gt;Me: And while we're on the subject of cleaning

The inevitable follows: IF I GO TOO LONG WITHOUT EATING THEN MUH BEE-

&gt;Me: You can eat without making a mess. Cleaning up after yourself isn't going to cause you to go into diabetic shock. I'm late for my classes

&gt; Be stocking shelves on a lazy Thursday afternoon with collegejockbro

&gt; A nice middle-aged woman approaches me and asks where the toothpaste is. I get up

&gt; As I approach, not three, but four hambeasts standing, as one would expect, near the cookies. 

&gt; I could try to move through the mass of blubber ... [but ultimately decide to go around](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/054/tumblr_kxa5vtEhlo1qzo4t5o1_400.jpg)

&gt; As I approach I hear the familiar snorting, but only as I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with collegejockbro do I realize the true monstrosities we are dealing with.

&gt; The head of the brood is a 5'2 ~260lbs. female; she has a rather unique smell, and old dog shit after it rains. 
&gt; To her right stands her breeding partner, both girls, probably about 9 and 7. They are still young enough to be considered ""cute"" and aren't yet insanely obese.

&gt; I pick up what the female is saying to collegejockbro mid-sentence:

&gt; ""-why don' you people evar have the same shtuff? I's it really dat hard to keep ur shelves stocked?""

&gt; Collegejockbro

&gt; ""The candy cane joe joe's are a seasonal item

&gt; ""Well then why don' u have'em then? Its only a few months after chismas""

&gt;FFS it is the middle of may

&gt; ""Yeah

&gt; The male notices me and says: ""So da ya two Einsteins no when ya get thos' cookies back""

&gt;Me: ""I'm not sure exactly

&gt; ""We drove all away here ta get mah wafe and kids sum cookies

&gt; collegejockbro's jimmies are on fire but he is cut off by the sow:

&gt; ""That is all we ca-""

&gt; ""I have had enouh of u two

&gt; I give collegejockbro a look that says ""I will take one for the team"" and he takes off like a rocket.

&gt; Since the woman appears totally done with me

&gt;""How dar ya to walk away frum mah wafe when shes talkin to ya!!! This is jus extremely rude.""

&gt; wat

&gt; I get up

&gt; The male makes a sound like a truck turning over

&gt; The children have been surprisingly well-behaved

&gt; The younger one starts straying from the herd and picks up a box of cookies; she walks back and says to mom:

&gt; ""Howa bout' these momma

&gt; Without warning

&gt; The child naturally lets out a yelp and starts crying:

&gt; ""Put'em back now emily""

&gt; Words cannot describe how much I wanted to kill this bitch. 

&gt; About 30 seconds later collegejockbro comes back with our assistant manager

&gt; ""Hello ma'am

&gt; ""We've driven all away here fur some canda cane joejoe's and you don't have'm

&gt; ""Ma'am they are a seasonal item; we will have them around the holiday season

&gt; The husband turns over like a truck again and the sow gurgles with annoyance

&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief, pleading, we were done, but alas, it was not so.

&gt; The sow waved one of her fat rolls in my general direction and said:

&gt; ""This one walked away frum me while i wasa talkin' to em'

&gt; A. I'm wearing a nametag.

&gt; B. Kill yourself.

&gt; 40-somethingMBA gave me a questioning looking and said:

&gt; ""That wasn't a good thing to do

&gt; ""No

&gt; My jimmies

&gt; ""Ma'am

&gt; Her voice became a high screech: ""No you didn't are you calling meh a liar?!!!!""

&gt; Before I could say anything 40-somethingMBA was johnny on the fucking spot:

&gt; ""No, thesefatrollz apologize.""

&gt; ""I am sorry to you

&gt; The sow snorted in acknowledgement but continued giving me the evil eye.  

&gt; ""Now

&gt; The sow waddles over to a nearby shelf and picks up the SAME FUCKING BOX of cookies her kid did and says:

&gt; ""I'dda hope u dun mind me taken des wit us complemetry all tings considered?""

&gt; ""Sure

TL;DR: Family of hambeasts ask for a manager after being told we don't have an item, and gets a free box of cookies.

1367864410.0,1dt1cj,Lardzilla needs her beetusjuice,None4GretchenWieners,438,104,133,"Good morning FPS

Some minor details before we start: I had a coworker (22, whiny, entitled girl I have ever worked with out of every job and coworker I have ever had. I will post stories about her and her fatlogic later.

Be me, having to deal with A's whining already (it's only 6 am). Ignoring her and doing my normal job of grinding coffee, filling up condiment bars, and filling the pastry case. A of course is just sitting at the espresso machine texting, because she is obviously so damn special that she only has to make drinks for customers and do nothing else. Enter group of employees from a nearby business, one of them being of hamplanet status. This woman is about 5'11” and 350 lbs and is going on about how she's been on a diet lately and is going to treat herself because she's worked soooo hard at losing weight lately. As I am taking orders from the others in the group, Lardzilla keeps going on very loudly about which pastry she should get. Whatever, I see her piggy little eyes zero in on something behind the counter. Before I have time to look

Me: “That is our Caramel Freeze. It's like a Starbucks Frappuccino

Lardzilla: “I'll take the largest size y'all have of that drink

MFW Lardzilla just ordered more calories than I eat in a day. In case you guys are wondering

A gets to work making Lardzilla's drink (and I am nearly gagging at how much caramel is going into it) and I bag up the croissant and the muffin. All of Lardzilla's coworkers are waiting on her (some have even left without her) and looking like they're about to be sick. I don't blame them

The next day, made even more caloric by the ¼ bottle of caramel going into it. Every day for the next 5 months Lardzilla comes in and orders the same items. At this point even A is disgusted, and that's saying a lot.

After said 5 months, Lardzilla comes in seemingly in a bad mood. She orders her normal order, but is all huffy about it. I pay her attitude no attention, I just smile and get to work on her order. A, however, takes the bait.

A; “Is something wrong? You don't seem happy like you usually do.”

L: “I've been working *so* hard on dieting

Me: “Excuse me? Ma'am, be it undereating or overeating. I had gained weight due to lack of exercise, but that's a different story.

L: “Well, so I don't know why I've gained weight!”

Me: “I drink an 8oz drink and it only has one pump of caramel in it. Caramel syrup has a ton of sugar in it, and I exercise for an hour every day.”

L: “Sugar doesn't make you gain weight! If it did

At this point, she had stayed healthy and thin, always weighing between 105 and 110. And I'm not going to even get started on the difference between unrefined and refined sugars, because I'm betting Lardzilla spends all the time she's not eating reading up on broscience.  I keep cool though, my face very neutral and my breathing even.

Me: “My grandmother is 84 and has had diabetes for 24 years now. She isn't really able to exercise much, nuts, beans, and a tiny bit of meat. She is able to stay thin and healthy because of the foods she eats.”

L: “Well, y'all must just have good genes then, because I eat fruits and vegetables all the time and I don't lose any weight!”

Me: “Well, I'd be happy to help.”

Lardzilla just gives me a hateful look

I ended up quitting that job about a month after that incident (had enough of A once and for all)

So anyways, F, 250lbs, currently down to 165lbs) and a gimp (girl with the robo-knees). Now how do you think I got there?

Yep. Raised by a planet. 

Mom and dad split when I was a teeny tiny kidlet. Dad's always had a ""beer belly"" but he keeps pretty active so whatever. Mom has always been planet. 

Super planet. 

Like currently about 5'4

Dad raised me mostly, but never really had a healthy diet so that rubbed off on me. Then my mom freaked out at him that sports weren't for little girls (wtf, mom) and demanded he pull me. So I had nothing, really. Nothing too physical as a child and a less-than-awesome diet. 

When I was a tween I started work at a horse farm and that took some of the chub away

Mom also guilted me into living with her full time instead of my dad. 

Seriously. Guilted. As in

She would poke at the fact that I was fat all the time. Despite being literally 2x my size and a lazy ass. She was mean and entitled and abusive. The only time she every got off her ass was to beat mine. She smelled, and demanded that I do everything. Literally. I had two younger siblings, but they were angels because they were the spawn of her and her current husband, and thus higher than I. 

I had to bring her her food, her fricking disgusting tent underwear, the mess she made in the bathroom that was 10 feet from the couch, and much more than you want to know about). If I didn't comply, she would use her mass to corner me and beat me with whatever she had on hand (usually a broom she wrestled away from me). 

She demanded that I feed her, in the afternoon I was required to come home during lunch hour in junior high school and during that time I was to get her lunch again, and in the evening... you get the picture. 

She ate typical planet stuff. Bacon, ice cream, things soaked in cream and grease, pizza, chinese food, fast food stuff... she justified this slave work by saying that she was in charge of meal times when she was my age, so I just accepted it. 

And of course I always ate meals out of what she demanded I cook

Then she got this brilliant idea that I was going to be one of those genius kids. I was on the honor roll all through school

Keep in mind I was like, and took care of her. So this on top of it meant I had nothing else.

And she also decided I was too fat (which I mean, so I would sneak food in the middle of the night and kept planet status), and would lock me out of the house in the late evening after work and my ""study session"" and cleaning the house so I could ""exercise"". I would be locked out, in the dark [9-10pm ish?!], in the cold, in the MIDDLE OF THE CITY as a 13yo girl for a couple of hours. With untreated, pretty severe chronic tendinitis in my wrecked ligaments.

Sometimes she was too lazy to get off her ass to let me in afterwards

So living in this situation... I was... er... everything every preteen dreamed of picking on in junior high school. I was fat, ill-fitting sweat pants and t-shirts to school, always snarly/bitchy due to home life/stress, cried very easily, greasy... you get the picture. I would get ridiculed endlessly at school and I didn't help matters by raging/crying every time it happened and doing the typical fat person things. 

One day in my crying/raging after someone spit a huge glop of snot/spit down my back

Mom was NOT happy. I hadn't been home to study/have supper. I shit you not. I got *stabbed*

She said she had to starve. She was irrationally angry. Commence the usual beating/hair pulling/insulting tirade with my siblings watching gleefully from the sidelines. 

One flubber-powered punch to the face sent me collapsing over the very HOT stove, I'd never done because I always thought I deserved it/knew she'd beat me worse if I did. 

She grabbed me by the neck with that bizarre fatty-strength they all seem to have and choked me against a wall

I hit her. Yep. I don't know why, and she immediately started screaming as if I had shot her. She ended up sitting on me/my stab wound, which I can't even tell you how painful it was, to ""get me under control."" When I wouldn't stop screaming/struggling, she threw me down a set of stairs. 

Then spent the next few hours (while I lay on the floor) screaming about how disgusting I was, disgusting, don't shower, etc. All things that she taught me, right. Also said she was calling the police because ""I assaulted her."" 

So I left that night. I hadn't had the courage to tell my dad what was going on before, and he rescued me. 

I lived as a fatass for a while longer

Then, I told her I was just eating less, doing more, and she verbally assaulted me about how unhealthy I was being, I need to eat more, I'm going to kill myself doing this, etc. Also went on about how it was bad for my knees. 

So I stopped and stayed fat for a while longer. But it didn't fit the lifestyle I wanted. 

Fast forward like 7 or so? years to now. I've been talking with her and seeing her once a year for about 3 years now. She denies every treating me badly, 400lbs. And FULL of fat logic (is convinced if she WALKS for 5 minutes 3x a week she'll start losing weight. As in, that's the whole workout) 

She sees that I've dropped 85lbs and is ""so proud"" and shows everyone my before/after pictures... 

and... get ready for the rage... 

Tells everyone

Boom. Fat entitlement at its most brutal. Need fucking credit for everything.

Sorry for the abrupt ending. This was a little more stressful to type than I thought it would be. Also sorry for the depressing story. Shit happens

She said, ""They're pretty much okay with it unless the costume is so perfect that the visitor might be mistaken for a park performer.""  That made sense to me, for many creeper reasons. 

Then I asked

She leaned in and said
________________________________________________________

Snow White was eating a dipped banana something with nuts a few minutes later when I saw her.  Her kids were standing around her in a circle

We saw Snow again later, with the addition of some bright blue oversized Minnie Mouse sunglasses pretty much killed any XXXL Snow White thing she might have had going on.  She was hunched over at a low table, eating a small tray of hot dogs and onion rings.  At least six dogs.  Her children sat quiet and watched.  Again, she didn't seem to be bothering to feed them.  As she ate, she lectured them, telling them that if they didn't stop their begging they wouldn't be allowed to ride any rides.  She sent one of the kids to refill her giant soda, and I noticed on the way back the little girl stopped and sipped at the straw.  Her face lit up for an instant before she surrendered the drink back to her mother, the Dwarves squabbled over who would get to take her “empty” tray to the trash can.  The two youngest kids carried it away

We were taking a break there, and that she'd be back in a minute.  All of this was shouted at top volume.  Her voice was strong but starting to become hoarse with the day's wear. 
Twenty minutes later

Later still, shouting ""Stay the hell out of the picture"" several times.  The boy took a couple of pictures, his mother tore the camera back from his hands and started off in another direction.  She had been eating some fries from a paper cone, but again, the kids didn't seem to be eating anything.  Snow was covered in ketchup, chocolate and other food stains, but the kids were still spotless. She slugged at a bottle of bright red Beetus juice she wore on a strap

Three hours or more go by until I hear that voice again, and soon enough the police joined the park security.  This usually means someone is getting arrested.

Apparently, but that she'd never returned.  She was arguing that she'd intended to get the kids in time to leave before the park closed! It was her RIGHT as a PARENT!  I guess, by this she meant she had the right to starve and abandon her children.  I don’t think she thought that argument through at the time.
The kids were taken into custody by the police, shakes and fries courtesy of either Anaheim PD or Disneyland, but it was obvious that they hadn’t eaten in quite a while.  

TL/DR: I saw an enormous screaming

&gt;mom please no I don't want to be eaten

&gt;""No

Some context: for reasons unrelated to weight, so there was already a lot of tension between us. Ursa Minor didn't come because she was on a roadtrip with her friends. Also, I've never had many friends and was seen through my childhood as the weird girl people avoided (mostly because of my nerdy interests, which I am thankful are now more mainstream) and was bullied a lot. Ursa Minor, at least from what she tells me, has never been that unpopular, always had a group of close friends and was pretty extroverted. This will become relevant.

&gt;""Why are you eating so little?! Sister

&gt;Well at least she stopped yelling and now she's just furiously hissing

&gt;Mother just sighs

&gt;Rest of meal in stony silence

&gt;At home

&gt;Unfortunately his decision did not stick


I realize it could've been resolved faster if I'd just done it, who is older than me and thus treats me the same way. It's why I don't talk to them anymore, they're family, but they have zero respect for anyone they consider underneath them. My uncle didn't talk much since he's just a quiet guy, even though I've known him my whole life I know next to nothing about him. Wonder how he got stuck with Ursa Major.

Backstory: Looking after family's junk food/movie store while they vacation. Located in hick town

Story #2: 

Evening rush just finished, beet red and SWEATING, despite it being a literal blizzard outside and stupid cold. I'm a little amazed at her dedication to get here, actually. She lumbers up to the ice cream counter and stands there, staring at the board that lists our flavours. I quickly walk across the store to put the DVD stack down as she wheezes at me, ""hey!""  

I smile like a good clerk and say

""I want ice cream."" 

Okay... so, I get the picture. I carefully put the stack on the counter and navigate to the ice cream section. ""Alright, just give me a second here!"" 

""I want to order some ice cream."" 

""Yep! I just have to wash my hands."" I rush to the sink and slick my hands in soap as she says. 

""I don't care

""Sorry, I'm not going to stick dirty hands in food for public sale... 

I finish up in about 5 seconds and by then Sumo Sarah is scowling. 

""Sorry about that

""I don't know what I want

... I don't eat ice cream. I'm a runner, just could have PICKED one and she wouldn't have known. 

""Why the *hell* wouldn't you eat ice cream?"" 

I can think of about 10 reasons involving calories, but I just shrug. ""Don't like it, I guess."" 

She grunts and sways for a bit

""I'm honestly not sure. People seem to like it

""No

""Ma'am

She slams her fist on the top of the sneeze guard and I back up. ""JUSTEATTHEICECREAM."" 

""Ma'am, but it's a thing I chose to cut out) ""I'm sorry that I'm not up to your standards, but that is the situation we're in. I assure you it's temporary and the owners will be back in two weeks and they can help you. Now, if you tell me what you normally like, perhaps I can list off the flavours similar to it."" 

Glaring and grumbling and stomping her feet

There's small bits of cake and sprinkles and icing flavour in it. It looks like blue and pink vomit frozen in a plastic tub. 

""Give me double scoops of that on a chocolate-dipped waffle cone."" 

I scoop it for her and she takes it while giving me the most nasty sneer and

""Now give me a bowl of that --"" jabs her fingers at some toffee and chocolate chunk monstrosity ""-- double-scooped with chocolate syrup. 

I should have known she knew full well what everything was about in this section. I got that for her as well. 

""And a single scoop on a pretzel cone of cotton candy."" 

All of my wat spilled out all over the floor as I finished up. I actually glanced around for a kid or someone else hidden behind her as I handed her the last thing. The diabeetus is growing strong in this one. 

""Will that be all for you?"" 

""No

Would it kill this woman to calm down and stop being a bitch? Probably. I silently get her a box with holes in it that you can put ice cream cones in so they don't fall over. I punch a hole for the one bowl and give it to her. She loads it up. ""Take those to the till and ring them in."" 

As I do what she says

""And when you're done that

I am the manager. Have been since the store opened eight years ago. Left home/lived in the city for 5 years

""Okay."" 

""Have them give me a call. Write down my number."" I do. 

Snatches her change from me when I finish the transaction

Oh

NOPE. 

She goes to her car, that fast?!

She then picks the box

""I dropped a cone outside in the snow. I need a new one."" 

I see the uneaten cone and the bowl in the box and realize she thinks she was being fucking sneaky. 

""Can you show me where you dropped it?"" I ask. 

""No

""Okay... ma'am... I saw you eat the cone in your car. I can't give you a free ice cream. I will scoop you another if you'd like

""IF I WANTED THAT MUCH ICE CREAM I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT MUCH. I DROPPED IT

""Sorry, and--"" 

""What are you saying? ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?"" 

""Ma'am

""When the owners get back, they'll hire any crackhead looking for a job these days."" 

""I'm their daughter.""

Act 3: Dinner is served

We sit down for dinner after the hamplanet went to the bathroom for what seemed like ages. 

Salad bowl comes out

""Weve all been trying to eat healthy ever since you've been training dale. teehee""

Body is frozen. Looking on in disgust as the curdles of dressing clump ontop of one another. No sign of leafy greens. 

Dale goes sans dressing. 
I am proud.

Hamplanet tells me how she used to be a fatsun designer and how I have probably seen some of her designs.

Yea whatever.

She had to quit because she developed a terrible thyroid condition.

Phasers set from stun

A gelatenous spice wofts through the air.

Fucking knew it

3 buckets

""We always have leftovers. Teehee""

Think in my head: even a zimbabwean tribe would have leftovers.

Hamplanet helps herself to 1-2 whole chickens.

Dale takes a piece and removes the deep fried crust.

Student has become the master. I am impressed. Horrible flashbacks to food journal.

Mon night: chicken
Tue night: chicken 
Thurs night: chicken

My anger rises.

She casually asks ""do you know any tips on how to lose belly fat? I just need to lose a little around the midsection

Jaw hits floor.
My anger rises.

I eat the chicken sans skin to give dalebro some support. Kid is a champ.

Hamplanet notices we arent eating the skin. I can see she is upset

""Nomnomnom fine if you wont eat it i will""

She eyes my fried chicken skin. 
Dont know what to do

Excuse myself to use the restroom. 

Act 4: Aftermath

I return from the bathroom

Sit down at my spot

Hamplanet begins her lambasting:

""I ate your skin

I cut her off.

""Your underactive thyroid stops you from losing weight""

The look on her face was muddled anger

""My father has one too.""

Hamplanet

She says ""oh so you must know how hard it is to lose weight than""

I think she smiled

""I know it is hard but not impossible, he recovered and he doesnt limit himself to the restrictions of his body, he overcomes them with the power and determination of his mind.""

Hamplanet was not ready for that shit. What could she say

&gt; One time when I was cooking I thought 


&gt; ""its good that I'm giving up what I want to do in life because it saves FC from killing himself""


&gt; The bomb fucking drops and I stop myself


&gt; I'm ready to throw the frying pan at his fat stupid face


&gt; RM1 has to stop me


&gt; FC hasn't noticed because omg Xbox


&gt; carry on as normal

Whenever I got my period he'd look disappointed and said ""I was hoping you'd be pregnant"" as a way of trying to forcefully keep me around. One time my period was late I constantly was having panic attacks and crying because I didn't want to be pregnant or have him breed. Back when having sex with him wasn't so bad, sigh and say ""I suppose I have to stop what I'm doing now then?"". Heartbroken I say no and just walk back to my room and cry.

7) Now shit has hit the fan with me when I come home from work I just cook for myself. Big plates of pasta enough for a decent portion for two people (although it'd be a ""snack"" by FC's standards). It's the last few months of our relationship and he's not made good on the effort to stop being a little bitch child after I told him to man the fuck up. A gas bill had come but the names on it weren't ours so needed changing

8) So FC repeats his first year of uni because he didn't do any work the first time round and still does jack shit when given a second chance. Cue more government money for junk food. The uni luckily sees this and kicks him out half way through the year. He then spends six months making excuses about job hunting and had applied reluctantly to 2 in all that time. Me and RM1 both worked and the three of us were looking for a private place to live now that FC wasn't a student

&gt; wait what....


&gt; AREYOUFUCKINGKIDDINGME.bmp

I can't hide my disgust at what he's just said. He owes me and RM1 hundreds of pounds

9) So FC finally runs out of money and hits his overdraft limit. No thanks for the free ride and his parents come to take him home. Money is tight enough already for them and they have 2 small children to feed. FC just sponges off his younger, I don't text him ever even though I love and miss him for some reason. He catches on to this and we talk over Facebook at a friends house. I end it with him and cry and vow to start getting the sex I've been missing out on. These are some of the things he said to me:

&gt; ""this is all your fault""


&gt; ""the only thing that makes me happy is knowing you'll never have anyone as good in bed as me"" (LOL!)


&gt; ""don't expect to get any of that money back""


&gt; ""shut the fuck up""


&gt; and goes offline

I cry a lot over the next few days

&gt; nothingtotalkabout@dealwithit.com

He texts me saying ""I want to come over to talk"". No way am I letting that shit into my new place with RM1. We meet at a local pub, RM1 and FC's loser friend. Things are awkward and tense. FC and me get left alone and tries to say things I can't remember to piss me off. Then he says ""I can't talk to you properly here"" then being the whiny little bitch that he is he storms out and I've never seen him since.

&gt; time to party!

&gt;Ask childhood best friend

&gt;Skitty lives in another state and doesn't have a lot of money

&gt;Not exactly rich myself

&gt;foresight.win


Break from the greentext for some background on Skitty. At the time our tragic tale takes place she was a recovering mini-moon who had always been pudgy but had recently lost a lot of weight from strength training and general not eating like a fuckwit. Fitness was a huge priority for her at that time, and at this time was the type of person who thought she needed to have a boyfriend to be validated as a person. She'd recently gone through a really bad break-up and I was worried about her, wanted her to be happy.


&gt;About 6 months before the wedding

&gt;Be happy that Skitty is finally moving on after her last break-up

&gt;Ask her about Wailord

&gt;ominous.exe

&gt;Still, just want Skitty to be happy

&gt;Skitty asks if Wailord can come to the wedding too

&gt;Fuck yeah

&gt;Spend the next several months going about my business doing grad school and planning a wedding

&gt;Still


&gt;Skitty tries gently encourage Wailord to pick up healthier habits

&gt;Wailord resists every step of the way

&gt;Claims he can't walk more than short distances at a time

&gt;Care to guess the reason?

&gt;If you guessed A CONDITION

&gt;One delicious beetus-placating cookie for you

&gt;Wailord is an insanely picky eater, or Starbeetus


&gt;Skitty's parents are divorced and her mom is getting re-married 

&gt;Skitty and Wailord go to Skitty's mom's wedding

&gt;Not a half hour into the reception

&gt;Skitty is maid of honor and can't really leave

&gt;Threatens to throw up in front of everyone if they don't leave

&gt;Finally Skitty agrees to take Wailord home

&gt;""You know it sets off muh condishun!""

&gt;Would be curious to know what this mysterious condition is that simultaneously makes one not able to do exercise and not able to digest vegetables

&gt;Disregard these foreboding signs, dresses to force onto my pudgy frame

&gt;Be two weeks before the wedding

&gt;Aw man

&gt;Wake up one morning to frantic e-mail from Skitty

&gt;Wailord's parents are cutting him off from his freeloading neckbeard ways

&gt;""WAAAAH They're gonna make me do WORK and that's OPPRESSION""

&gt;Being cut off means also no more car

&gt;Wailord can no longer drive to the wedding

&gt;Be annoyed about short notice because flights aren't cheap this close in

&gt;Wailord pitches an almighty fit

Part 6: Survival of the fittest 

Enter my mother

DuckDuckHam had worn out his heart due to copious eating and it was hanging on by the thinnest of threads. This had resulted in DuckDuckHam not being able to work for a bit so his Health Insurance wasn't going to cover his stay much longer (Dat American Health Care). In situations like these

BUT (and its a big but) DuckDuckHam had to prove that he was changing his lifestyle and trying to eat less because even in his deplorable condition he was still chugging down whole chickens and cows attributing it to ""If I'm going to die

""DuckDuckHam

""Oh thank you lord!! That is good news!""

""Let me finish

""HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LOSE THAT MUCH?!""

""For starters

""BUT MY BLOOD SUGAH""

""You'll be fine""

""HMMPH! WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT?!""

""Then we have to release you""

""YOU CANT DO THAT! THATS AGAINST THE LAW! ITS DISCRIMINATION!""

""Sir

(The bills were approx. $125

My mom checked up on him everyday and he seemed to eat just fine but at the end of the two weeks they weighed him and he got 15 pounds fatter.

howintheworld.noface

Turns out he had his kids sneak in food and ate it because the diet was ""too hard"" and ""rabbit food is not for real people""

He ended up being released despite throwing a tantrum

1367020552.0,1d6rqa,Part 3: Lardquisha and the Moons - ConfectionAffection’s Coming Out Story,ConfectionAffection,442,118,76,"[Part 1]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d4s3e/part_1_lardquisha_and_the_moons/ ) [Part 2]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d5rqx/part_2_lardquisha_and_the_moons/)

This is the epic conclusion to the Lardquisha and the moons incident and the story of how I unintentionally came out to the world. For background

When we last saw everyone’s favorite chocolate braised hamplanet, due to the fact that she tripped on a case of “pickles and liquid defiance” that she herself deemed necessary to kick without provocation. Naturally, I could not help laughing at the lardbeast and the justice inherent in the Great Fall. We rejoin the story just as her initial tirade is winding down (precious calories were being expended, dehydration was imminent—hamplanet problems).

&gt;Be me 


&gt;Standing


&gt;My face is light pink in hue


&gt;The moons’ orbits were interrupted


 &gt;”…AND YOO A FAT-HATIN MUFUCKER THAT GETS ALL UP IN MAH BID-NISS WITCH YO MUFUCKIN BOXES TRIPPIN’ UP THIS GERRGEOUS ASS


&gt;Hambeast is gasping for breath after 5 straight minutes of yelling


&gt;Hambeast takes two ~~breaths~~ wheezes before delivering the coup de tat of fat paranoia. Note that not a word had been said by myself at this point


&gt;”I BE GETTING’ SO MUFUCKING GODDAMN TIARD O’ SKRAWNY BITCHES THINKIN DEY SOOOO MUCH BETTER DEN MA BLACK ASS JUST CUZ I GOT SUM MEET ON MAH BONES AND LAUGHING BEHIND MAH BACK THINKING THEY SO HIGH’N GODDAMNDMIGHTY! YOU DON’T LIKE DIS PHAT GETUP” (gesturing to “Dusty Rose in the Ghetto” colored tinfoil jumpsuit) 


&gt;”AN DIS PHAT POLISH AN DIS HERR WEAVE? MUFUCKING **DEAL** WIDDIT!” 


&gt;Silence falls across the store, wheeze*


&gt;Lardquisha braces against the berber-cue sauce shelf (her original target) due to mental and physical exhaustion


&gt;The need to say something begins to grab hold of insides


&gt;Two other stockers are now gathered


&gt;[TFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfkw24emFr1qaz4rk.gif)


&gt;T, feel her empathy, desperation, and helplessness


&gt;It dawns on me that Lardquisha and the moons are looking at me expectantly—they expect an apology


&gt;Not a word is spoken


&gt;awwwwheeeeellnerr.jpg


&gt;I decide to tell the lardbeast what’s what


&gt;”I think your nail polish is great” says I


&gt;”Wat” says the conscious section of my brain 


&gt;This is where my gayness begins to gain relevance. You see, nail polish, outfits, dye jobs—whether good, bad, or ugly. In her rant I heard her accuse me of not being like hurr ""phat"" nail polish, the only thing she had said that I could refute without completely lying


&gt;”O yerr?” wheezes the hambeast


&gt;”Yeah


&gt;Note: by match I meant that they were both pink


&gt;”Aw boo, giving me a ~~sultry~~ salty look from the corner of her eye


&gt;ERROR: DOES NOT COMPUTE


&gt;”Yuh want mamma tuh give yerr a lick


&gt;WARNING: ALARM ACTIVATED


&gt;WARNING: GAG REFLEX ACTIVATED


&gt;Lardquisha advances towards her prey, nuclear missile: Fat~~boy~~gurl


&gt;Every corner of my mind is sent into a flurry

&gt;Be scared that any way of saying no to the ~~ham~~sexbeast’s proposition will be met with a slow and terrible death


&gt;Pray to the old gods and the new to show me a way out. Alas! My prayers are in vain


&gt;Autopilot takes over


&gt;An unrecognizable
&gt;”Bitch


&gt;…


&gt;*wheeze wheeze*


&gt;…


&gt;ohmygerrdwhatdidijustsay.jpg


&gt;An awful pause fills the entire store


&gt;The physical constants of the universe break


&gt;”Aw he-YEEEEEEEELLLLLL-nerr!” exclaims Lardquisha

&gt;She turns on her tiny heel faster than I would’ve thought possible. For one glorious second, subject for an instant to rotational inertia, assuring me that the physical constants have returned


&gt;I breathe a sigh of relief


&gt;Psssssst


&gt;The sound of a two liter of purpul drank being opened sounds through store. Dafuq?


&gt;The hambeast thirsts


&gt;Appeasing one bodily requirement


&gt;”OH AH SEE HOW IT IS! YA ONE UH DEM MUFUCKIN’ ERBOBININATIONS (translation English to Ratchet: abominations). BUT DON’ BE TRIPPIN’ **AH** KNOW HA TERR FIX YO PROBLEM


&gt;The hambeast’s instructions for turning me into a non-abomination were cut short (and just when I was gaining hope that I finally found someone to solve my gayness!) by a massive


&gt;The resonance frequency at one point during the Great Deflate matched the florescent light tubes above


&gt;Lardquisha, whereupon my knees finally buckled and I laid my forehead on the cool metal that was top of my trolley


&gt;This is where I die


&gt;[MFW](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7fe0zghDz1rrv726.gif)


And that was how I stayed for the rest of my metaphorical lashing. The specifics of said lashing were largely lost to me

* The fact that I was gay was a choice

* Yes

*  What I was was an abomination

The irony that hung in the air during the latter-most statement was thicker than the purpul drank stank/~~flab roll~~ curves odor that hung in my aisle for hours afterword

At some point, T came to me immediately with a hug telling me I was great regardless of my sexual preference and that we could recover from Lardquisha’s reign of terror together.

Another coworker, told me we were still cool and the three of us went on to be excellent friends.

You see, GHB, and the rest of my coworkers, I gained the courage to come out to my family and my other acquaintances, and have since felt the weight of a thousand Lardquishas lifted off my chest.

After all was said and done, a pig eyed offender, a dark plight!

(I am not whoring for comfort/attention

TL;DR Lardquisha confronts me, I blurt out a secret, she berates me, lets out a belch that is still today a universal record in size and volume, yells some more and leaves. I turn out the better for it.

I hope this conclusion appeases the hams that be. A teaser for you all

As a gay man (and a fat man) the comparison just makes me so angry I can barely stay coherent. Yes, that's still no excuse to compare it to the much worse discrimination that LGBT people continue to experience.

What's worse is that apparently now that DOMA and Prop 8 are gone

Name me a place where being fat can get you executed. Or the states where fat people can't marry thin people. Or the federal benefits denied to fat people.

They can't do that

Now I know what she said was obviously a lie. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if every guy wanted to dance with her.

&gt;mix my drink take a sip and head to sit on one of the couches

NOW I KNOW! You're all kicking yourselves and probably hating me because I'm such a horrible beta. “TALK TO SCARLETT” “FIND SCARLETT” I know =/. Don't worry your cheesy fat saturated souls because some divine intervention had done the work of finding her for me.

&gt;'twas dark and loud

&gt;bumped into about 8 couples dancing before I could reach one of the couches with an empty seat

&gt;sit down

&gt;man where the hell is Scarlett

Now

Then. It happened.

&gt;”WHEEEEEEEEEE!”

&gt;magnitude 8 earthquakes

&gt;house breaks and everyone dies

I finally get a glimpse at the planet that almost took my life. See

&gt;I desperately look at Scarlett for some assistance because this planet wouldn't let me leave it's orbit

&gt;the couch has literally BENT down the middle

&gt;Scarlett looks like she's had one too many drinks

&gt;wondering how much damage to my neck she's caused

&gt;probably less than the couch

At this point I was extremely scared that I messed up things with Scarlett permanently. From previous interactions with Scarlett during the week I found out that she's the one roommate who has to share a room with someone. Can you all guess who that person is? Yup, food wrappers all over the place, playing music(KPOP!) at all times of the day. She even caught her sitting on Scarlett's bed naked after KG took a shower. So I'm assuming Scarlett feels bad that she was bitching to me about her roommate who she now thinks I like.

&gt;look for Scarlett everywhere

&gt;ask FitGirl who I see holding hands with CB in the kitchen making themselves drinks

&gt;she says she didn't see her

&gt;give up because beta and make more to drink

&gt;and more

&gt;and more

&gt;stopme.7z

At this point I was beyond gone. I only remembered small tidbits of what happened in the short while of my drunken stupor but Arty and CB had almost everything that happened to me stuck in their minds forever.

This is what they told me

&gt;I danced with almost every girl there

&gt;notexactlywhatyouthink.mp4

&gt;i danced like a drunken fool

&gt;it shouldn't even be called dancing because I was just writhing there while the girls felt awkward

&gt;almost puked up a lung in the girls toilet

&gt;stuck my finger in between two people making out outside

&gt;right in-between their tongues

&gt;wtfiswrongwithme.yolo

&gt;and then

&gt;then I danced with KG and SH

&gt;it was the biggest sandwich in the world according to CB

&gt;he said it like watching two 250-300lbs sesame buns close in on a brown hamburger

&gt;thatkidiscolorfulwithhiswords.zip

From here on I remember what happened clearly. Hold on to your Jimmies. This is a rustler.

&gt;feel something pull me

&gt;go with because I'm still so wasted

&gt;pulls me upstairs

&gt;into a room

&gt;oh good

&gt;see two beds floral patterns on one

&gt;this... this isn't my room

&gt;get shoved pretty hard onto the one direction bed

&gt;ohlookit'sliam.jpeg

&gt;feel the life getting sucked out of me as something heavy falls on me

Now

&gt;freak out

&gt;I can't lift more than 190 lbs in a drunken state. I've tried

&gt;feel my sweat trickle down my neck

&gt;[mfw](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/face.gif ) it's not my sweat. It's her greasy saliva

&gt;nopls.goop

&gt;she's licking my neck

&gt;like i'm food

&gt;yell CB's name

&gt;yell Arty

&gt;yell Scarlett

&gt;”HAH YOU'RE SUCH A TEASER LUCIST. DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T WANT ME

&gt;stop this

&gt;”OH WHY? YOU LIKE THAT BONEY GINGER DON'T YOU? EVEN AFTER I TOLD YOU SHE WAS SUCH A SLUT AND FUCKED ALMOST EVERY GUY HERE”

She was delusional. Her story wasn't even concrete. Fatlogic.

&gt;she starts reaching down

&gt;tugs at my belt buckle

&gt;FUUUUUUUCKKKKKKTHIIIIIS.MP1000

&gt;with all the strength of Zeus I shove her to the side

&gt;she rolls onto the floor and seriously can't get up

&gt;half drunk half a ball you see

&gt;proceed to stumble my way to the door

&gt;open the door

&gt;Scarlett was outside

&gt;[mfw](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_ODcECzxGQ/T4sMKffGa8I/AAAAAAAAA88/LnQ8Dvynqbg/s1600/michael-scott-no.gif )

&gt;sees KG on the floor with half her clothes off trying to roll herself onto her legs

&gt;sees my belt buckle half open

&gt;says a quick sorry and turns around and heads downstairs

&gt;try to follow but I'm so drunk I trip down the stairs

&gt;CB and Arty find me and take me home

&gt;sleep. Glorious sleep.

&gt;next day wake up in a drunken stupor

&gt;need water. Bad

&gt;see TE eating breakfast

&gt;asks me how I'm feeling

&gt;i realized that no one realizes what happened to me yet

&gt;TE tells me that after I fell down the stairs FitGirl had to go find Scarlett who seemed really upset and told CB that I was done for the night and to take me home

&gt;he also tells me that they found KG and SH in KG's room

&gt;apparently KG was too drunk to pick herself up

&gt;she texted SH to get up there and help her “quietly”

&gt;TE heard the grunts upstairs and being the perv wanted to creep a bit

&gt;[hfw](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Grossed-Out-Ew-Reaction-Gif.gif ) he sees SH trying to pull KG up off the floor

&gt;tells me he saw brown spots on SH short shorts

&gt;darker then the color of my skin

&gt;relative justice? 

I hope your jimmies got what they wanted. I told you this was a russtler and OP delivers. Now, so I know I was dumb for not telling anyone, but #betayolo.

Till the next part

This is going to be a massive series I'm thinking. KG has so much ~~curhves~~ content.

1366825642.0,1d0u2g,Bar Blubbernought Bitches like a Boss,BahamutWings,400,73,81,"OK, play rugby and american football. Yeah theres deffo a ""fat pad"" and i aint ""sculpted"" but i know my way around a gym and alot of the power is in my thighs at 32 inch circumference


Now this story is from my days of bar work, so when i say shift shit, i mean a Ton of vodka in cases from delivery point to cellar on my own. I get shit done. 4 cases per trip, or a 160lb barrel on each shoulder.


From here i hope you take 2 things: 1: I am big, a work ethic that puts most to shame.


3 years ago the bosses decide that we no longer have different types of staff. We used to have Front of House guys (tickets and cloakroom), team works better together, and if someone is injured etc they can do a sitdown job on front of house. Shifts get shared and swapped better too. I loved this, i got to work on the bar (eventually made it to supervisor).


Now, a Blubbernought, a veritable sphere of 5 foot nothing and 280lbs. Now, in a busy bar you can afford a little dead weight, but she was more than a little. Now, here's where the plot thickens, her girlfriend is the Supervisor. FML.


Fast Forward 3 months of summer and its now freshers week. The busiest time of the year. We're talking 12 events in 2 weeks, money is money.


What follows is all true


Shift 1: I'm on Bar, do you mind getting the other 2?"" She looks at me like i just spat in her face. ""i cant lift heavy things, because my knees are bad"". Yeah, because they're allready carrying your lard arse. I retort ""im just as big and my knees are fine"". She opens maw to respond, thinks better of it and just vaguley waves a cloth over the bar pretending to clean. I take all the crates back and think no more of it.


Shift 2: I draw shift shit duty (bars not connected to the cellar need almost constant restocking) and she pulls Bar. With about an hour left it gets quiet, pack it with VK (sugary alcopop) and lets get going to Mezz(anine) Bar"". Frumpyface. Tells GF. GF tells her to use trolley. I move 3/4 of the shit to all the other bars, she does some token trolley runs interspersed with swigging of drink, munching on sweets, and trying to subtley make out with GF behind bar.


Shift 3: We both pull Bar duty on the main bar. This will be interesting. I do my usual running about like a blue arsed fly routine, we all take the odd 5/10 minutes in the longer 6+ hour shifts, generally to scoff some sugar to keep going and catch a fag (cigarette to my transatlantic cousins). But she set a record. In the 7 hour shift she spent only 4 hours on the bar. Shift ends, no drama, i get on with it.


Shift 4, lovely guy from Africa (country forgotten). He was older than the bosses but that guy is awesome, he gets shit done. We get put on the same till and took the most for the night. But unfortunately disaster struck with an hour to go. We were joking about when all of a sudden he turns around and full on goes OVER the Blubbernought. She'd sneaked to the bar after persuading someone she needed a break from sitting on her ass and come over to make out for a minute in the cellar with GF. Adam landed badly and twisted his ankle. Refused to go home, and hobbled to cloakroom to finish there. That meant i got Blubberlicious on my till. Piloting around the Death Star aint got nothing on the moves i had to pull to reach around her to get my shit done. At one point she was stood infront of the till chatting to a friend and i ask her to move. Evilstare.initiate(); She says ""you're always on my back about me because i'm fat, we should be looking out for each other."" erm. WHUT?! Look, im big, but i can see my feet and could bench press her. I just say ""look i got work to do"" and she mutters and flees to GF.Supervisor. I think nothing of it. Top bar taker on Freshers gets some free gig tickets for later in the year.


Shift 5, i need to see you in the office."" Okeydokes, i think, probably has a delivery he wants me to deal with.

NOPE.

""BlubberTits the Vast came to me after last nights shift and says you've been bullying her all freshers about her weight.""

Erm

""She says you call her lazy for not shifting stock and taking breaks""

Sure i may have said ""oh get on with it"" but nothing thats really offensive or anything.

""She wants a written apology from you""

I have covered this bitches shifts

""Well

""We all know shes only good at lifting cakes BahamutWings"" - Winning. Boss kows the score. He knows she's a bitch

""I get you Boss, ""sorry, didn't know my fault etc etc etc."" I hand it to her when she arrives 15 minutes late. 

A snatch and a snappy ""thanks"" later i go get on with my shift moving shit. She gets her Front of House on arse ticket selling stint.

2 hours later im called to the office to cover her so she can take a break. Fair play

""Wheres Butternought?""

""Still on break""

""Shes been 30 minutes""

""I know""

""fuck sake""

""Told you she was lazy""

*Solemn Nod of Solemness*

Boss gets on the radio to find out where the fuck she is. Guess where? in cellar with GF having around of tonsil hockey. Boss drags her ass back. Get venomous stare from her ""You grassed me up"". ""Whatevs"". I get back to hauling the universe of beer around the building.


Shift 6 The Finale of Fat encrusted Fuggliness: BlubberBalls GF calls in sick, oh wait, one short. Go down roster, even Adams in with his ankle strapped up, MIA is Blubberbutt the Balloon. Fuck it, i turn to the team to give the pre shitstorm pep talk: ""right guys, last event, im supervising tonight so someone else will get them gig tickets. *get chuckle*. BtB is missing

""I HEARD THAT

Fuckthisshit.EngageFury();

""Yeah, arrive on time and have record breaking takings to my name, WTF have you done?""

She Does this sort of run out. Tears flooding down her face.

Feels good man.


Boss approaches me an hour later.


""Guess what happened in my office just now?""

FUCK IT ALL.

""Well BtB probably put in another complaint""

""nope. she quit. and shes suing the Students Union for discrimination""

Fuck all the FatLogic.

""Fine"" i deadpan.

Boss looks a little surprised.

""if shes gonna try and sue

Bosses face sinks

""oh

And that is how i lost my Bar Job.

""but you said you got to Bar Supervisor?"" i hear some of the more astute amongst you say.

Yeah i did. 

Her discrimination case went before the powers that be at the Students Union. She basically said i lead a campaign of bullying based on  her weight.  Union agree with my resigning as the end of it.

I enjoyed my fat paycheque from Freshers work and lived a pretty good life about town for a bit. Then shitstorm happened. I fuck Blubbernoughts GFs Ex. Blubbernoughts GF at work starts a smear campaign of how i have ruined her life and blubbernoughts. Boss calls her in. She resigns

Fat justice just tastes so damned good.

So if some of you have read my stories in other threads

That park was never too bad.  Only one or two big rides, and the guest always appreciated that. Add to that a pretty decent water park and friendly co workers, and I usually didn't dread going into work.

Anyways, giving bandaids and such.  If a call for an EMT came through, then you'd escort them through the park, and perform crowd control while they did their thing.  It was also where you brought lost kids, and that's where 90% of our time was devoted to.  Plus it meant I got to sit and watch the fire works display the park put on, without having to do guard duties during the show.

So I'm sitting in the office, and making it understanable, I'll dispose of the 10 codes.  10 codes are stuff like 10-4 and 10-20 you hear people saying over walkies a lot).

Park Employee:  Hey guys this is the Supervisor for the North section. We got a guest here whose complaining of feeling light headed and naseuas. She is short of breath and having a hard time standing

EMT: Ok we are on the way there.

We begin our walk over, attempting to sit up unsuccesfully. She's bellowing to her children to help pull her up, but no child would dare risk being sucked into the lost forrest of fat rolls, never to be seen again.  I don't know how tall she is, but this woman's girth was Honey Boo Boo's mother plus 50 lbs.

We help the woman sit up and move her to the shade.  She's slightly dilerious and slow to answer.  It was probabvly about 90 degrees that day

Eventually we get enough out of the woman to learn she's diabetic.  She claims she hasn't eaten all day, and they had all gotten orders of fried oreos.  The EMT asks her where he testing equipment and insulin are located.  She says they are in the car.  The car that is at least a 5 minute walk for an in shape person.  Then, the single stupidest thing I've ever heard came out of this Planet's mouth.

""I don't understand.  Sure I had some food

EMT:  How many cups of water would you say you've had since you entered the park today?

Planet:  Water?  No

EMT: Soda?  Why would you be drinking soda if you're diabetic?

Planet: Well

Yup....I don't think the EMT knew what the term ""Rustled Jimmies"" was, but the EMT gave her a blood test and ended up sending her to the hospital. Despite her protest.  Her blood sugar was dangerously high.  She didn't want to leave because she had ""paid good money to be here"", and because ""we were ruining the holiday for her kids.""  We sent her on her way with the ambulance, and waited with the kids till the father got there to pick them up. I felt bad the kids didn't get to see fireworks and spent the night at the hospital instead, but I couldn't blame anyone but HBBPlanet",,False,t5_2vzax,True

**Flabpotamus Part VII:  Comeuppance**
 
During Sisterhood Of The Travelling Flabs’ term at our clinic, because the doctors want to have someone who can take bloods on site to make their job easier, and it is convenient for patients. The docs had started to notice, however, that patients tended to make excuses to go somewhere else. Most were polite and avoidant, and said that they wanted to go somewhere closer to home, or their nephew's girlfriend worked at suchandsuch and they wanted to support her. Not CrankyDude. He’s an elderly chap who needs to have a blood test every 1-4 weeks to monitor the effects of a blood thinning medication. He continued to come to Simon and Flabfunkel because he lived a 2 minute walk away, and didn't want to gets taxis to go somewhere else.

Every time CrankyDude had his blood test done by Flab Plastic Trees, to set up in her room. It improved things for a while then broke. I felt sorry for that machine.
 
He also complained that she was never in her room - as she was usually in the tearoom feeding

And
 
We told him we weren't really in control of what she did

Manager also fed back possible reasons why Osama Bin Flaben was not getting as much business as they’d hoped, despite the reports from the staff in question being contradictory. She gently suggested that maybe Honey Flabger needed some support and counselling regarding her interactions with co-workers.
 
Gone With The Flab then had a performance review in which they told her she had to stay in her cave at all times other than her prescribed 30 minutes for lunch and 15 minutes for morning tea
 
&gt;”But it's not long enuff! I need to eat because of my condishuns!”
 
They also went about investigating the source of what was known as 'the moistness'. Apparently,"" she replied.
 
Positively Flab Street had left some sort of mystery liquid on the chair. No one was game to try and wick any up from the chair to perform forensics. There came a whole review process where she had to go and see her own doctor and have a report written about whether this fluid was sweat, and whether this posed a biological hazard to her workmates. It was ruled that Flabber Lickin’ Good would be required to either wear a panty shield to protect the upholstery from her unholy excretions, or they would provide a plastic seat cover.
 
Flabberwocky was placed on probation, and to her credit, she did start to smell just a little bit less horrifying over the following months.

Her supervisor asked the reception team to keep an eye on her (as her little abscess of an office was right next to the reception area)

Of course
 
CrankyDude continued to file his complaints. It seemed that Mrs Flabinson's massive girth was impeding her ability to do her job. Her fat sausage fingers were becoming increasingly less dextrous for tasks involved in blood taking. (ThinPrivilege is being able to employ fine motor skills.) Also her job required her to stand, and CrankyDude would (with strange pride) show us his bruises after her molestation of his veins.
 
She tried to file a worker's compensation case
 
The patients’ repeated complaints

I think she was given an admin job at the pathology company

I feel kind of bad for her. There was obviously some sort of emotional problem driving her eating, I don’t see why she had to be such a fucking bitch about it, and certainly life was much easier without her around. I hope she eventually got help though. I had to get help for my eating problems because they might have killed me, and I think people who habitually overeat themselves to an early grave need help as well.

But, and I really have enjoyed telling this tale!
 
Star Trek: The Flab Generation was replaced by a really quite pleasant person, participated in normal superficial conversation and pleasantries, and never tried to condemn or seduce any of our employees. We all lived happily ever after, jimmies firmly back in their jimmy holders, beetus quenched and soothed.

First of all, I have 9% body fat, but that was unacceptable to the extraordinarily intelligent people on reddit who know how to work the Google machine, so I got retested this morning before the gym with my team's trainers. 

1. Skinfold Measurement - 9%
2. Bioelectrical impedance analysis-10-11%
3. Height and circumference methods- 11-12%

&gt;Be working on squat. PR 275

&gt;""Don't even think about it

&gt;*raises eyebrow* ""Uh

&gt;*run over to back up* ""She's so rude!""

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;I decide on some leg machines

&gt;See fatty fat fat and her fat brigade tromping down the stairs. 

&gt;Already used to the sound

&gt;Make a dirty face at them

&gt;Start the hip abductor machine, which most people really could benefit from doing.

&gt;Queen Hambelina sits next to me on the other machine

&gt;MFW she put a Venti Caramel Ribbon Crunch in the cup holder of her machine. 

&gt;I go on about my business even though I have a soy protein shake

&gt;Take a swig of my protein shake

&gt;""You shouldn't drink those."" 

&gt;MFW she would not stop bothering me. 

&gt;""It's my protein shake

&gt;SO done with this bitch. I have an All-American Lacrosse boyfriend at D-Middie. He counts calories just as much as I do

&gt;""Well

&gt;She fucking CUTS ME OFF

&gt;MRW she has known me for 20 seconds.

&gt;I finish my last rep and leave.

&gt;""By the way

&gt;HFW I called her out.

&gt;""Well--I--fuck you!""

&gt;I walk away to the free weights to be with my back-up and hang clean my anger away. I know you all think it wasn't beta and super awesome

&gt;Look up and see the Cross fit workout for the day.

&gt;21-15-9 Box jumps

&gt;Hell yes

&gt;Back up grabs all the equipment

&gt;See Fatty fat fat Hambelina go over to the exersize bikes on the other side

&gt;MFW if she comes and opens her fat fucking maw at me while I'm crossfit-ing I will cut a bitch in her force field of adipose tissue. 

&gt;She sits on that poor bike and I hear it groan across the floor. She peddles what has to be a mile an hour sipping on that sugary cup of death.

&gt;I make a face. She's literally disgusting

&gt;Back up starts the timer and we get to work. 

&gt;During the sit ups

&gt;""Ignore it

&gt;MFW he's right. Go on about the 15 crunches to get back to box jumps.

&gt;ORW we're done, clutching my water bottle for dear life. (For anyone that doesn't know, that means 21 of all those things, then 15 reps of those things, then 9 reps of those things, aka crossfit is the product of satan.)

&gt;""We did good."" fistbumpofgoaliebros.jif

&gt;I roll over and see two fat cankles spilling out of $200 pink Nikes. *looks up*

&gt;I can barely see her stomach past her gigantic gut. She has to be 5'6"" and easily 300 pounds. 

&gt;""You're not even that fit. I could've done that without breaking a sweat. You just jumped around and threw weights.

&gt;Myfuckingfacewhen. 

&gt;""What do you even do? I feel bad if you play a sport

&gt;I actually have no words. She is actually saying these things to me. isthisthereallifeorisitfantasea.mp3

&gt;Back up rolls his eyes

&gt;Fatty McFatfat scoffs

&gt;And my vision goes black. I start screaming in that weird death whisper your mom always gave you when you were in a public place.

&gt;I grab her by her -sweat- grease soaked tank top that had her fat rolls spilling out all over the place. 

&gt;""Then do it. Race me to do this workout. I bet your fat fucking ass can't even get you up on that box, but you're just setting yourself up to get your ass kicked at ANYTHING in this gym. So perform, or get the FUCK out of my face and my gym.""

&gt;Back up looks shocked. But not as shocked as Hambelina. 

&gt;Her jowls wobble in an attempt to say something back. 

&gt;I growl

&gt;She blushes as everyone closest to us in the weight area looks at her

&gt;I am huffing from the workout and the adrenaline that that took to scream at her. I shake because I can't believe I was so mean. 

&gt;Back up pats me on the back. As we clean up

&gt;The gymbabe smiles at me. ""Thanks for that. Hopefully she won't come back. She's been picking on the fit girls here for like 5 months."" 

&gt;MFW she's been doing this to others who wouldn't hesitate to kick her ass. 

&gt;I nod to the couple

My jimmies were soothed a few days later when a troope of fatties came in, as well as another gym bro if we could help them with the machines. 

&gt;eyes get all big and sparkly. I help all the ladies

So I hope your jimmies are rustled enough! I love all of you! Happy Beetus-ing!

As I draw closer, Scooter's eyes glaring beadily, making no attempt to cover it up. I'm generally non-confrontational, but they're overstepping the bounds of polite society, so I ask Scooterbeat, ""Can I help you?"" as politely as possible. Maybe not that politely, though
They look at each other. I see the fire of a thousand barbecues alight in Fattie's eyes. She turns to me. ""You shouldn't waste all that food if you're going to throw it up when you get home."" She points to my chips and whole milk. ""Don't fucking tell me you actually eat that stuff."" She and Pizzaface are probably smirking
At this point, I inform her that I'm actually trying to gain weight right now, hence the food choices. Wrong choice; she launches into a tirade about how I should just be eating fast food instead of wasting my time with chips and milk.  
At this point, not rolls.""

This one isn't so much of a story as a list of shit my on-the-way-to-becoming-a-nebula roommate does and says. We will call her Eventual Planet

When I first moved into this house with two girls and a guy (that dude is a trooper, I promise). When I first moved in, EP was on the chubby side of normal. 

I think I left some of my old weight lying around because she fricking found it. I am now lighter than her by a good amount and I'm still ~6lbs overweight. 

Which I normally wouldn't judge

Here's what the problem is. She judges everyone. Bitches about everyone she meets, complains about being single ALL THE TIME, and always talks about her ex boyfriend and what a douche he is (we got the picture after about the 3rd time, no need for the extra 500) and then cries about it when he gets a new girlfriend. 

So with how complainy she is

I have to do something soon. 

Now

First hint of trouble. 

&gt;Be on a grocery shopping adventure with EP and British roommate (BR)

&gt;Drive by McDick's

&gt;EP suddenly moans with longing 

&gt;""We should stop

&gt;Me

&gt;""Man, eh?""

&gt;EP turns around and glares at me. 

&gt;""I don't count calories

&gt;okaysorrywhatever.jpg

Sense shit is going to get real in the following months. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;TR is very underweight and is very self-conscious about being too skinny

&gt;Helping her gain weight

&gt;EP is watching me teach her to use stability ball in reverse crunches

&gt;Fast forward a couple of days

&gt;Coming into house from a run

&gt;EP is walking around house at snail's pace

&gt;Groans loudly as she sits down in the kitchen while I grab water 

&gt;""I did those crunches you showed TR. I didn't do many but man is it ever a workout! My abs are so sore! I did like 10 of them

&gt;""Oh cool

&gt;""No that's it

&gt;Okayfairenough.png

&gt;EP complains for next day and a half about how sore her abs are from 10 crunches 

As time goes on, so I know when it happens. Because she announces it loudly. ""Okay, gonna workout!"" Probably about once every other week or so. Comes up from basement (where our ""gym"" is) 20 mins later looking like she laid on the couch the whole time. I offer to help sometimes and she just gets angry/says not everyone has the time that I do to work out. 

I work 3 jobs but okay. 

Eating habits getting worse as days go on. 

&gt; Be EP

&gt;Seriously

&gt;Eats bacon every other day for breakfast. Maple bacon. Normal maple bacon. 

&gt;Because low-fat and turkey bacon ""suck and taste like fake bacon."" 

&gt;1/2 package of bacon is just side for eggs

&gt;When she doesn't have bacon she has eggs benedict with mass amounts of hollandaise sauce made with extra butter because ""I can't help it

&gt;Judges my food. Makes weird comments about it. 

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;""I don't know how you do that

&gt;""You're not even going to put some sugar or something in your oatmeal? Gross."" 

&gt;Makes fun of BR's food 

&gt;He eats some form of soup every day. 

&gt;And pasta. 

&gt;He's super skinny

&gt;Can run like crazy. 

&gt;Makes everyone this super amazing tea out of super crappy tea bags a few times a day

&gt;EP scoops sugar into every cup he gives her. 

&gt;EP

Then came the slightly TP comments. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;TR has to go to work

&gt;I am excited. ""We found a store where both TR and I found jeans that fit great!"" 

&gt;EP is not excited. ""I'm surprised something like that exists. I can't find jeans that fit anywhere. Stores just cater to model-size

&gt;My ass is still fat

&gt;I found jeans. 

&gt;Mention that TR can't ever find jeans small enough without them looking like capris 

&gt;""Oh whatever

&gt;What. The. Actual. Fuck. 


So after trying multiple times to casually help her with exercise and diet I gave up for a bit. But then it didn't stop. She would constantly compare her body to TR's and talking about how lucky TR had it. TR is super uncomfortable with her skinniness and so I keep telling EP to stop commenting on it. She ignores me and bitches about how much easier TR has things and how she wishes she had tonnes of boys trying to date her like TR does. When I explain that it's causing trust issues (TR isn't ever sure when a guy is being her friend or just being nice to try to get into her pants) she says it's still better than always being single. Also says I have no right to say anything because I have a boyfriend. So basically everyone's opinions are invalid. 

Alright. That's enough for today. I'll stretch this out just specially for you folks

How the hell do I manage to make every single one of these a whole novella's worth of story? Holy hell. 

Also some advice on how to get after EP about health would be awesome. But remember I have to actually share a house with her

**TL;DR**: Continually expanding roommate is full of fatlogic and constantly bitches/whines/complains about everything while judging everyone and making my tiny best friend feel super self conscious via hinting about Thin Privilege. Also has disgusting eating habits she refuses to change.

Now that we’re all comfortable and have properly whetted our persnickety palates

During our last time together I told the tale of Rotundra’s terrible termination. However, teehee) to nearly a year prior to her eventual demise.

As the last leaves of Fall faded to brown and the screeching harbingers of the chilling Winter months that would soon befall our sleepy city blew between the deadened branches of the trees October was nearing its end. With the end of October comes what had up until this particular year been my favorite of holidays—Halloween. 

Thus

In the weeks leading up the party

However, I soon noticed that many of my coworkers—the Berthas in particular—were seemingly more concerned with their dates than their costumes themselves.

In case a refresher is in order, a woman of truly celestial proportions who had been ignoring NASA’s yearly requests for her to return to orbit as Pluto, so we could once again have nine planets in our solar system. 

In the time leading up to this point, I was scorned by their progressive sense of moral value. 

But

As I have mentioned in previous chapters

I had managed to make one good friend during my brief stay—Tom. Tom worked in the IT department and had something of a bad temper when it came to ‘stupid people’ (aka nearly everyone)

I had quickly realized an important truth: one good friend in the IT department is greater than a legion of acquaintances not in the IT department. Prior to this job, Tom was in a different league all together.

We had become good friends in a relatively short period of time—it turned out that we both had many of the same interests. What really sealed the deal however was when he found out that I was running track for my university—he had run cross-country in high school and was dying to get back into shape

During our lunch breaks we would sit in the corner of the cafeteria at one of the few tables uninhabited by the Berthas

Due to the lunchroom’s relatively small size and concrete walls

It turns out that the mere mention of working out and eating healthy were ‘triggers’ for many of the Berthas and unfortunately Tom and I didn’t know how to use trigger warnings to protect their fragile faculties from our patriarchal hate speech.

Our clear inability to check our male privilege at the cafeteria room door led to our two-man oppression devastating any hopes for peace. And

However

As Tom and I sat there munching away at our ‘rabbit food’ and discussing leg exercises

“Hey guys

Tom and I quickly exchanged looks and replied

“Well

Now, they both thanked us and left.

Both Tom and I were shocked that we had managed to have a normal conversation with two of the Berthas—but skeptical they would actually put any of our advice into action. Either way

Word travels fast among the Berthas

With only a week and a half left leading up the party

That was

Once again

However

As I nearly choked on a bit of carrot, I’m taking my wife and were going together with Onikakushi.”

“So he [me] doesn’t have a date yet then?” She teased.

“No

“Well

If I had ever needed one of those Twix breaks

Luckily, he’s going with us—that means the **three** of us, how many times do I have to tell you?”

“Let him speak for himself! It’s not you she wants anyways—I bet you’re just jealous that a real woman like her would want him and not you!” The larger one exclaimed while pointing at Tom.

My brain hadn’t fully reengaged, so I can’t go with her, sorry.”

This wasn’t going to end well—I could feel it in my bones. They were not going to take no for an answer and both Tom and I knew it.

There was only one choice left.

“But

The two Berthas looked at one another and whispered something between them quickly. “Is he as hot as you two?” They asked.

“Oh yeah,” Tom replied.

“Well that works
 	
News of Rotundra’s mystery date had spread like barbeque sauce on ribs before the end of work and the same question was on everyone’s mind—just who and **how** are they going to do this.

Tom and I knew we needed a plan

So that night

So without a moment’s hesitation we typed out a request for a “stud with muscles to match” who “knew how to treat a ‘real’ woman right and was willing to escort her to a Halloween party in return for some sexy time afterwards.” We went on to require them to post their bodily stats and the costume they would wear.

There was totally no way this could possibly fail.

Within a mere day

After sifting through multiple fake and quintessential “yo baby u wnt sum fuk?” responses

The first wouldn’t return our phone calls

While obviously Tom and I knew he was either so roided out that he was liable to explode at any given time or was lying through his teeth (if he had any)—we didn’t care as long as he showed up. Trey told us that he had often gone to Halloween parties as “shirtless Aladdin

We couldn’t wait.

On the night of the party the main waiting room / lobby that usually seated all those hopefully awaiting their turn was converted into a Halloween themed ballroom—with punchbowls and treats to match.

Tom, in true Bertha fashion, Rotundra always needed to stand out the most—and stand out she did. Her costume consisted of what appeared to be lingerie paired with a jewel-encrusted mask that only covered her eyes and nose—she claimed to be a “succubus.” Never before had I ever wished to be asexual as strongly as I had at the mention of that word.

Nearly everyone had shown up by now and we were starting to get worried that Trey may have had second thoughts

Luckily

Tom quickly texted him back telling him to come inside and look for the woman in the mask—that you couldn’t miss her. 

As both double doors came flying open as though Zeus himself had thrust them open

Tom and I knew it was over

“Ey baby

After a few seconds of looking flustered

Needless to say, personalities. 

Following the weekend and our return to the office on Monday

Looking back on it to this day

Tom and I continued to eat together and life proceeded as ‘normal’ as it always was at the job center. That was of course until Trey applied for a job in the mailroom a few months later—but that’s a tale for another time.

**TL;DR – I narrowly escape being served up as an offering for Queen Beetus with the help of my newly acquired brother in arms. We then manage to rig together a plan even MacGyver would have ‘mired and save the Halloween party**

I was working for a pizza shop in my hometown that was run by a pleasant Turkish family and I loved my job (unfortunately issues caused the business to close so I could not continue to work there). So anyways I get a call for a large pizza, and then it gets weird.

I pull in and head down a flight of stairs to the appropriate apartment. As i walk down the stairs I get BLASTED in the face by a smell that I can only describe as a moldy, burnt hair, mold, and a dead animal. This shit was foul. I hold my breath and knock on the door. A voice replies from within, ""Let yourself in, it is open."" Weird. But whatever. I go in and the smell elevates to code red, like uncovered mass grave type of smell.

He has a desk in front of him and is motioning to it so I place the food down. Directly next to the couch is a four foot tall mountain of empty 2 liter Pepsi bottles.

He had left his credit card info with the restaurant so i handed him the receipt and pen and had him sign it and he writes a fat 0 with a line through it in the tip column and then signs the bottom (with a remarkably good looking signature I must add). I take the receipt and he says, ""Go in the kitchen and get me a fork and a knife."" I was too confused and terrified to do anything but wander through the trash infested living room and dining room to go into the kitchen (still no lights) and listen to him give me turn by turn directions to the fork and knife. The kitchen floor was stained and covered in so much dirt and grease that i could kick a layer off, there were more dirty dishes in the sink than all of the dishes in my entire apartment, and there were piles of trash everywhere. I got him his utensils handed them too him and he handed me back my tip, 2 warm sticky quarters. I thank him and get the fuck out as he tells me to make sure the door shuts behind me.

I was traumatized and felt so dirty afterwards. The more I thought about it and talked to people about what the fuck had happened

The way this works (since I'm not sure if it's common) is you can rent out kind of a conference room there, coats, all the other things small children come with, and a place you can have your cake and all that.

&gt;Present time!

&gt;Meliboea and two other girls banded together and got me something rather expensive (I think it 
was $50 though I don't remember what it was)

&gt;thank them profusely

&gt;Then Niobe pulls out another present

&gt;Not to sound ungrateful

&gt;It was some cheap

&gt;Badly painted

&gt;Could barely open

&gt;Had scuffs

&gt;Honestly, then 
decided to hand it off to me.

&gt;The kind of thing you only give to someone to insult them.

&gt;Niobe was proud as fuck about it though

&gt;""We even gave you something else! We didn't *have* to
on you. We're just trying to be good guests

&gt;I am totally aghast as to what to say

&gt;Ursa Minor seems like she's been building up rage for a bit though so

&gt;""Yeah

&gt;Niobe gets even more red than before

&gt;Seriously

&gt;Party's winding down anyway

&gt;Peoples' parents start arriving

&gt;My parents are busy so it's mostly Ursa Minor saying goodbye and thanking people for coming

&gt;Niobe and Meliboea think it's time to bring their orbits elsewhere as well

&gt;But of course

&gt;""I want a seeeecond slice of caaaaaaaake!!!!!""

&gt;""Meliboea

&gt;""But

&gt;""Meliboea, maybe you have food at home?""

&gt;""I want caaaaaaaaaaaaake!!""

&gt;""JUST GIVE HER ANOTHER SLICE.""

&gt;""...""

&gt;""She's HUNGRY

&gt;""...she wants cake. All children want cake. But we don't have enough to give everyone!""

&gt;""UGH! Then give it to ME! PARENTS should get cake

&gt;by now the other parents are staring at this confrontation between the titans

&gt;""WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF KIDS SO WE'RE TIRED AND NEED FOOD!""

&gt;""But you didn't take care of anyone!""

&gt;""DON'T YOU THINK PARENTS SHOULD GET SOMETHING?!?!?!""

&gt;At this the other parents look worried

&gt;My parents are looking worried too

&gt;awkward silence

&gt;One person's mom speaks up

&gt;""Um, so...""

&gt;all the other parents start chiming in

&gt;Niobe sees this as support

&gt;""SEE? THEY DON'T WANT IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE ONE EXTRA SLICE. THERE'S ENOUGH FOR ME. GIVE IT TO ME.""

&gt;parents give in

&gt;She finally waddles off to fatter horizons with Meliboea

&gt;later at school

&gt;Surprisingly

My mom felt really bad and bought me a second

I think Meliboea went on to develop the beetus in high school, everything (not a thyroid problem though. Alas). She also started eating m&amp;ms absolutely nonstop. Every time I ever saw her, she had m&amp;ms. I swear to god I saw them spill out of her pencil case before. I do not fucking get it. My mother and Niobe hate each other now. Sometimes they see each other while grocery shopping. My mother enjoys reminding Niobe that my university's better than Meliboea's even though I didn't go to many supplementary classes, amongst other things. Niobe, I assume, enjoys her cake.

Starring: 
Lucist: 18 M 5'7(170cm) 188lbs(90kg). overweight

CollegeBro: 18 M 5'11(180cm) 180lbs(81kg) of pure muscle. High school friend attending same college.

Scarlett: 19 F 5'4(162cm) 115lbs(52kg). A girl I met in one of my freshman classes. Fit as all hell. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson. Lives with Gobbler.

Kimmy Gobbler: XX F 5'2(157cm) and a GENEROUS 300lbs(136kg). Star of the show.



So I'd like to preface this woeful tale with a little back story of yours truly. I was never a complete hamplanet, basically, I was really sensitive about my weight. So I ended up working out the summer before college thanks to CollegeBro and ended up losing 22lbs by midsummer. Even after the weight loss, I could never shake that feeling of inadequacy for being overweight.

And so it begins:

 I had moved 6 hours upstate with CollegeBro to attend a tech school learning to develop dem vidya games. CollegeBro and I rented a small

After moving in (helped CollegeBro move up his entire damned gym into his room) CollegeBro wanted to go say hey to the next door neighbors. Being the beta I am, he goes by himself. Man I envy that kid and his Alpha-ness.

After about an hour and a half he comes back with that shit eating grin he always gives me when he's accomplished something.

commence the green text:
&gt;""Yo Lucist! You should have come with me man.""

&gt;""Wat?""

&gt;look over at the house he just left

&gt;see two of the most attractive women I've ever seen wave at us

&gt;one was a redhead the other a brunette

&gt;they giggle and head into their apartment

&gt; ""All girls man. Every single one.""

&gt;CB pulls something out of his pocket

&gt;CB seeing my face calls me a beta and says they invited us to a party next weekend and that he would introduce me to them

&gt;myniggah.7z

&gt;charge him and start hugging every part i can grab. #NoHomo

As you can probably tell, he never took anyone giving me shit and always had my back. 

Now

&gt;first class of my college career. FUCK YEAH!

&gt;sit in the middle row because don't want to commit to a side

&gt;take out notebook and pen like a good college student

&gt;hear someone yell ""HEY!"" pretty close to me

&gt;no fucks given

&gt;feel the hand of an angel on my shoulder

&gt;isthisthepromisedland.rar

&gt;[MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpomiiIJHN1qii6tmo1_400.gif) I turn to see the cute redhead from next door connected to the hand on my shoulder

&gt;she stares back

&gt;hold the line men

&gt;she bursts into laughter and everyone starts staring at us

&gt;I notice the stares I'm getting by all the other guys because this girl is amazing

CB likes to remind me that I can be awkward as fuck at times

&gt;""so

&gt;""yeah

&gt;""don't you dare!""

Find out her name is ""Scarlett"" and comment on how she looks like Scarlett Johansson. Talked about a lot of things in that short amount of time we had before class started. She was a really interesting girl. But then

The fluorescent lights flickered. Earthquakes rocked and shook the classroom and our desks. The pen on my table bounced up and down to a very rhythmic beat. I'm pretty sure at one point I heard a small child cry. I look to the epicenter of the seismic activity to see my first ever Hamplanet. 

I grew up in a town where Hamplanets are scarce. It wasn't that we were a healthy town, CURVAY, and very spherical planet ~~walk~~ roll towards Scarlett and I.


&gt;she managed to slow down and stop right in the edge of our row.

&gt;maybe she'll sit at the edge

&gt;besides

&gt;why would she sit with us? Right? RIGHT?

&gt;[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Miley-Cyrus-surprised.gif) Scarlett waved at her.

&gt;she waved back

&gt;""Hey KG! Saved you a seat""

&gt;proceeds to squeeze into aisle

&gt;sweating from pure effort

&gt;something just hits me

&gt;she's coming in from my side of the aisle

&gt;MFW I have no face

&gt;the ball rolls closer and I get to actually see what she looks like

She was the most fantastic thing I've ever seen in my life. I didn't even know something like her could exist. Let's start from the bottom shall we? She wore sandals with those straps that you tie up your leg to keep them from falling off. Those poor straps. I've never seen anything so stretched and frayed then these straps wrapped around her cankles. She wore fishnet stockings that looked like they were about to break and fly into space escaping her orbit. She wore a T-Shirt with a picture of Justin Bieber on it. I'm not one to start the JB fangasm because I'm not a fan. I don't like the guy

&gt;”HEY GIRL! YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED FOR BREAKFAST

&gt;man her voice was shrill

&gt;Scarlett says she's sorry but she had an early classes

&gt;look down at my book because beta

&gt;realize that it's raining indoors

&gt;realize I'm losing my mind

&gt;look over to planet to see raindrops flying at me from her mouth

&gt;”SO

&gt;she called me a brownie. My family's from India

&gt;doesn'tmattergotcomplimented.bin

&gt;Scarlett introduces us

&gt;planets name is actually Kimmy Gobbler

&gt;KG and Scarlett are roommates 

The professor walks in and begins class. Lecture was done through powerpoint so the room was dark for the entirety of class.

&gt;feel a slight nudge from Scarlett's side

&gt;passes me her notebook with a 3 x 3 drawn and an x in one of the boxes

&gt;fuck yeah tic tac toe

&gt;ithinkshelikesme.avi

&gt;spend half the class playfully cheating at tic tac toe and writing notes to her

&gt;hear a loud creak from other side

&gt;in as close to a whisper as all her curves let her muster:

&gt;”HEY GUYS I WANT TO PLAY TOO! I'M REAL GOOD AT O'S AND X'S Tee^hee”

&gt;most annoying teehee ever

&gt;she calls it O's and X's

&gt;be a nice guy

&gt;beat her because I'm awesome at it

&gt;she wants to go again and tells me not to cheat

&gt;wat?

&gt;Scarlett is giggling softly

&gt;KG proceeds to claim that she's allowed to put 2 O's down because ~~she ate a lady~~ she's a lady

&gt;howshouldireact.mp3

&gt;notafuck

&gt;KG wins all of them

&gt;iwonderwhy.flv

&gt;KG grins like she's seen a mountain of bacon and she has a team of pallbearers to carry her up it

&gt;poor pallbearers

&gt;Scarlett gets my attention and wants to pass more notes

Halfway through the class I hear KG rustling through her bag.

&gt;KG pulls out a family size bag of chips

&gt;mustbewatchingherweight.doc

&gt;realize that she's eating them now...when the professor went over a strict no eating in class policy

&gt;takes a big handful of chips and begins to stuff them into face

&gt;sit there listening to the medley of noise she's making with her meal

&gt;realize by her movements that she's trying to eat quietly

&gt;professor has supersonic hearing

&gt;turns on lights to see who is actually committing the dirty deed

&gt;[hfw](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg ) she's caught

&gt;”Excuse me

I'm a pretty avid reader of FPS and I have read a lot of things Hamplanets say when it comes to them and their food. As this was my first encounter with a Planet

&gt;”EXCUSE ME

&gt;the small sonic boom her voice causes makes me recoil

&gt;professor explains that if she had such a condition

&gt;makessense.jpg

&gt;”I DON'T NEED TO BRING IN A  DAMN DOCTOR'S NOTE BECAUSE MY CONDITION IS SO OBVIOUS. ARE YOU BLIND OR SOMETHING?”

&gt;she says this to a professor with a doctorate

&gt;try to imagine what her condition could actually be

&gt;look over to Scarlett who has a blank stare and has gone off into her own world

&gt;professor looking as red as a ham(hah!) asks her to take her stuff and leave now and bring a doctor's note tomorrow

&gt;she then proceeds to curse at the professor

&gt;whatintheactualfuck.png

&gt;calls the professor a dried up fat shaming whore

&gt;i'mnotjoking.mpeg

&gt;picks up her bag

&gt;”BYE SCARLETT

&gt;sink into my chair

&gt;realize that the air clears up a bit

&gt;realize that the air was actually musty and dirty when she was sitting next to me

&gt;look at the empty seat next to me to check the damage she caused on these sturdy chairs

&gt;those loud cracks and creaks could not have been good

&gt;see what looks like something greasy pooling itself in the middle of the chair

&gt;idon'tthinkthatsjustsweat.ini

&gt;realize that I'm staring at her chair for too long and look at Scarlett

&gt;Scarlett was staring at the liquidy substance to

So this was my first meeting with KG. I know it doesn't have much Beetus infused goodness, has become entirely scarred from living with KG for said week.

In June of last year, and demeanor, had led to his file being flagged.  I knew his case worker personally - Bertha, a jolly (and perhaps a little chubby) middle aged woman who was normally unflappable, but who started stammering when discussing this child with me.

This is the kind of case I specialize in: the kind that leaves professionals scratching their heads.  I relish these challenges.  And so it was that after a late lunch on a spring day

The house looked like the owners took care of it.  The boy's mother

By all outward appearances

It's always the normal ones that're the freakiest

Her child seemed gaunt

I began to sweat.  What was going on?  I felt dizzy.  I had to draw up a chair to listen to the boy's tale.

""I see fat people

Over half an hour I drew out an incredible description of a world almost unimaginable to a normal man like myself.  He talked of disgustingly fat men and women, and that besides, they weren't fat.

The child was clearly fixated on ""fat people"".

The scheduled half hour seemed to drag on forever, lost in thought.

I went over my notes more thoroughly

*What if he's right*

A healthy dose of reality would be needed for this one.  I'd need to take him out into the real world

As I finished up and stepped away from the table

I squeezed behind the wheel of my Buick and absentmindedly planned my route home after a hard day's work.  I'd probably be going by the new Taco Bell.  I could really go for some of their chalupas right about now.

&gt;Wake up in the morning to Eris’ crying 

&gt;I hear it coming from the bathroom 

&gt;Go to check it out
Eris checked her weight

*What are the chances?*

&gt;Eris: It’s not working

&gt;Mom comes in to comfort Eris

&gt;Mom: Sweetie you haven’t it given enough time to get into your blood system yet

&gt;Me: yeah it’s probably has nothing to do with your diet

&gt;Eris’s weeping subsides

The next couple days Eris is checking her weight multiple times throughout the day. Sometimes her weight decreases and she is ecstatic. And other days her weight increases and she is depressed. A [graph]( http://i.imgur.com/x3HQR8v.png) detailing what is going on. 

&gt;Eris: Mom I am putting on weight faster than ever

&gt;Mom: This is completely normal. I’ll try to explain what is going on to your body the best I can. 

**Fat Science News Report**  
Mom:  Okay when you burn calories, however if you burn a lot, like now when you are taking the Coffee Extract Pills, it generates a lot of heat. This heat can be damaging for your organs, so the body builds up a lot of water before you can lose weight so the body can keep itself cool. The more calories you are going to burn the more water your body will take in. You should be happy; your body is putting on a lot of weight that means you are going to lose a lot of weight. If you want to speed up the process start drinking more liquids. I remember hearing on Discovery Health, before you can lose weight you have to gain weight.

[Da fuck did I just hear]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_BvpLLe-A)

&gt;Eris: Thanks mom

Mom: Let’s just get over this phase quickly

**Author’s Rant**

I hate when idiots use the word ‘ion’; I have studied chemistry

**Resuming**

So Eris and mom went to Costco and bought enough Gatorade to supply the 2014 Olympics (it’s so nice to see that food stamps go to the people that really need it!)

Eris starts drinking a lot of Gatorade; in her mind she isn’t doing it for personal gratification (Bottle of Gatorade ~300 Calories)
[Artist Depiction]( http://i.imgur.com/gZUEXX4.png) of her consumption behaviors.

As time progressed Eris continued to gain weight while her faith in her mother’s words faded. Even the [Mighty Oz](http://i.imgur.com/qbgGAqX.jpg) and his promises of weight loss were questioned.

 Sadly the idea of cutting down on food and exercising was never thought of as valid options to counter the weight gain. It has been decided that the meat filled salad will be returning so she doesn’t put on more weight. 

&gt;L O L 
 
Home life started getting worse and worse

&gt;Come home from hanging out with Britney and Nekane 

We have been hanging out together without Eris; Eris has no idea that we do stuff without her now. 

&gt;Go to open house through garage code… not working odd

&gt;Ring on the doorbell… no one answers

It is obvious that they are home

&gt;An hour passes by

&gt;I get a phone call from Mom.

&gt;Mom: Ares where the fuck are you? Me and your sister have been worried sick.

&gt;Me: You guys locked me out don’t act dumb

&gt;Mom: your sister did that only to punish you

&gt;Me: punish me for what?

&gt;Mom: I don’t know

&gt;Me: So you knew she was locking me out yet you didn’t say anything?

&gt;Mom: come home before I tell your father about this

&gt;Me: Go ahead.

&gt;Hear glass shatter through the phone 

&gt;Hang up

&gt;2 seconds later

&gt;Me: What do you want?

&gt;Eris: Leave Britney’s house right now

&gt;Me: How’d you know I am at Britney’s house?

&gt;Eris: I just know

&gt;Me: Night

&gt;Hang up the phone and turn it off

Next morning Britney’s mom drops me off home after I have breakfast with them. I ring the door bell this time they answer.

&gt;Mom: I told your dad about what you did; he wants you to call him right now

&gt;Don’t answer

&gt;Go to check my laptop it has bacon piece on it…Eris must have went through my laptop

&gt;Open it up.. God Dam

She must have found out that her friends and I have been sending nasty messages about her behind her back . In all fairness

&gt;I call my dad

He is upset and warns me that this is the only home I got and he isn’t going to pay for me to live in a dorm. 

&gt; I explain to him the full story including my face book comments.

&gt;He tells me to first of all

&gt;Second that mom is a “fucking lunatic” (why he divorced her) and to expect her to pull this type of shit

&gt;Third that I am not going to be able to change what other people do

&gt;Eris wakes up

&gt;We have breakfast together no one says anything 

&gt;After breakfast Eris and I begin talking about what happened

&gt;Me: First of all I want to apologize for my comments about you

&gt;Eris: I always loved you

&gt;Me: I shouldn’t have done that

(I am lying

&gt;Eris: Did they always hate me?

&gt;Me: Uhh what?

&gt;Eris: Britney and Nekane

&gt;Me: I don’t know them that well to tell you

&gt;Eris: the first day they met you

&gt;Eris starts to cry… oh god

&gt;I go to comfort her

Wanted to originally confront her for using my computer looks like that won’t be happening. 
Fucking women

&gt;Eris: I get it

&gt;Me: you are my sister

&gt;Eris: then why did you let her sit on your lap but pushed me off

**Wait a second…things start popping into my head**

-incest searches
-sitting on my lap
-fapping loudly
-jealousy between her and Britney

[Brain blast!]( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx31xuUmlG1r3bteso6_250.gif)

**Eris has feelings for me! And I told her I loved her more than Britney FUCK **


&gt;So there I was

&gt;In hostile lands

&gt;With crying sister next to me

**End of Part III**

**Message to readers**

I know many of you are thinking; now it clicks for you? Well looking back, I thought trying to be funny or purposely trying to make things awkward. I never thought of my sister in that way, and assumed she would never look at me that way. (People that have opposite sex siblings understand)

Those that are curious about why I didn’t move out
As always if you have any questions or request any clarification let me know!

**TL-Dr**

Eris locks me out of house because I have been hanging out with her friends without her. I apologize to her and realize she has feelings for me. 

**Question to the Mods and Readers** 

In writing these stories there is a lot that I am excluding from the stories for the sake of sticking to the sub-reddit’s rules. From the comments most people are deeply interested in the plot so I was hoping if I could get an exemption from the normal rules. This does not mean that my stories will contain no fat logic and gluttony; it is that I won’t skip over important parts of the story to get to the next instance of fat logic.

And here goes. We're going to try a real life green text story. If you like it better or worse than my old stories please let me know. 


&gt;Be about five months ago

&gt;TR and I both had an awful day

&gt;Drowning our sorrows in wine because we're adults. 

&gt;EP comes home

&gt;Night before had (literally) broken down crying about how TR and I never include her in anything

&gt;We do

&gt;Because of fit the night before

&gt;EP decides for us that we need to eat our feelings. 

&gt;Bakes cookies

&gt;Bacon is pretty awesome but neither TR or I want any

&gt;EP says shut up and eat my bacon

&gt;TR and I split a piece to shut her up

&gt;She made the whole package

&gt;She eats what we don't. 

&gt;... we had *one* piece. 

&gt;EP says to TR

&gt;TR looks like she's about to cry. 

&gt;I say that's not cool. 

&gt;EP ignores me takes the opportunity of awkward silence to steer the conversation to be about herself. 

&gt;No man loves her

&gt;The only person to ever care about her is her ex

&gt;No seriously

&gt;Guys did you hear

&gt;fuck. 

&gt;Cookies are done. 

&gt;TR and I decline cookies. 

&gt;EP gets angry

&gt;No. =/ 

&gt;Fine

&gt;TR and I don't get to talk any more. 

&gt;EP is miserable because she tried to go shopping and ""all the stores have been adjusting their sizes to be smaller

&gt;No EP

&gt;""At least girls like TR can find cute clothes

&gt;TR says she never finds clothes that fit. 

&gt;TR says XSs are either too big or too short. 

&gt;TR says shopping sucks just as much for her. 

&gt;EP disagrees: at least she can get bigger clothes and belt them and still look ""smoking hot."" 

&gt;TR says no, I'm paraphrasing.

&gt;EP actually tells her to shut up. 

&gt;TR is so upset she is indulging in alcohol to feel better (we aren't big drinkers)

&gt;At least boys find TR attractive

&gt;At least she looks hot in everything. 

&gt;She has it so easy. 

&gt;BR shows up just as I'm about to murder EP. 

&gt;Senses something is wrong. 

&gt;""I'll make some tea

&gt;Best roommate ever. 

&gt;Tries to help me and TR steer the conversation in a different direction. Asks how my appointments went

&gt;EP is having none of it. 

&gt;Keeps coming back to clothes shopping and boys. 

&gt;Fuck off EP 

&gt;EP says she just doesn't understand why stores cater so much to skinny people. 

&gt;BR says he can't find clothes that fit

&gt;""Yeah well it's different for boys."" Fricking hell... 

&gt;Tea is ready

&gt;BR makes best tea. It's magical. Mixes it and hands it out. 

&gt;Everyone begins to happily drink

&gt;EP scoops two big spoonfuls of sugar into small teacup. 

&gt;""Okay

&gt;Yes. You ask this almost every day. 

&gt;""What's the point of having it if you don't even enjoy the taste? At that point you're only drinking for the sake of drinking. You all have let loose every once in a while."" 

&gt;BR makes tea for everyone 3x/day at least and every time she scoops in sugar. 

&gt;She says she can't handle people right now. 

&gt;Storms off. 

&gt;Bitches everyone out the next morning for leaving a mess in the kitchen after she cooked ""for everyone."" 

&gt;No one else ate her food. 

**TL;DR:** Roommate on her way to being a planet makes greasy food, and her fatlogic, with a hint of Thin Privilege preaching. British Roommate saves the day with tea. 

I have more stories from her that I will be sharing. She's getting worse. Most days she's alright and is sometimes straight up friendly and good to be around,False,self,t5_2vzax,1370386356.0,,,t3_1cbd4h

This incident occurred at a hamily reunion around the beginning of June; one that I

A month or so ago, sadly, don’t include material suitable for this sub), granny brought up the recent hamily reunion. I didn’t think much of it, since Muh Muh (which is now synonymous with Auntie Ham and Auntie Hamuh Muh, if you don’t know why read [this series]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1e3diw/the_long_awaited_muh_muhs_odyssey_part_i_muh_muhs/)) never comes to these reunions due to her shut-in personality type and lack of general mobility. Until granny utters this mini rant:

“And you’ll never guess who was there! All the sudden, I don’t know who she thinks she is speaking to me the way she does.”

I suddenly can’t breathe at hearing her IRL name

“Well

“Oh

Grandpa mutters something about how “Muh Muh’s a damn cow

“Well I was just curious, guise, she doesn’t like to gossip.

So granny and grandpa are sitting there on a hot June day under a tent at the hamily reunion, a brother of Muh Muh’s, once held a shotgun to grandpa’s face, so he has every right). But granny, being the good catholic that she is, has forgiven and forgotten. And also loves to talk. 

Hammy behavior abounds, torturing folding chairs to death, drinking, and, of course, eating their body weight in mountains of southern-esque food. This food is provided by the one sane sister in the family who somehow attained a normal job and married a normal, middle class guy. The normal two are the hosts. 

Perhaps granny would’ve felt the gravitational shift that would have warned of an incoming lump of Darwin-defyin’ flesh

Nonetheless, the dearest Muh Muh. She (slowly) stands on one leg, whilst bellowing inside the van about hurryin’ uph, “cuz her knee~~s ache~~ aches.” From the passenger side comes her surprisingly normal looking, middle aged boytoy, with a bariatric wheelchair. 

Muh Muh is summarily dumped into said wheel chair
Daughtermoon rolls out of the van towards the congregation, resulting in poor social skills.

Muh Muh has clearly regressed after losing so much weight, which remember is minus one leg.  She’s 6’0, for reference, all these cousins are monstrously large in every dimension. Time has not been kind to Muh Muh, her skin now resembles that of a bloated [naked mole rat](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/05/article-0-14D90002000005DC-639_634x463.jpg), large dark brown moles pockmark her cheeks, and her hair is beginning to grey noticeably. Daughtermoon (who I have seen recently, 5’8ish. 

As luck would have it, since at that second Muh Muh bellows at her boyfriend to collect a trough full of beetus for her cuz she’s sturvin’ and needs tuh eat. He scrambles into the house, granny chooses to ignore the beast, thinking back on her [previous antics]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1dvoo0/auntie_hams_brush_with_death/). 

Muh Muh used huff. It’s not very effective. Muh Muh used huff again. Granny is getting annoyed. Muh Muh uses whirlwind huff of doom

“So how are you Muh Muh

“Oh muh gawd, and muh knee is actin up sumthin fierce,” Muh Muh says.

Probably the weight gain, I’m sorry to hear th—“

“AY! AY

He relents

“I thought you’d quit smoking

“Tuh!” Muh Muh scoffs

“They already took muh leg
Dem docturs don’ know nuthin

This brief speech has deprived her of nicotine for too long

Granny is practically speechless at this point. She makes a poor choice and attempts to reason with the whale. 

“But, you’d have died.”

“Well [14 year old cousin] has the beetus an they ain’t taken her leg!” Muh Muh counters.

For the record, diet control, and a ton of exercise.  

Granny considers explaining this

“So what’s wrong with your other knee?” 

“Oh, uh have tuh use it it’s the only one uh gawt left!” the whale chortles.

“Uh gots me a lawyer too!” Muh Muh says proudly.

“What do you need a lawyer for?” granny asks incredulously.

“Cuz it’s them docturs’ fault that uh gots the arthritus an’ bursitus! If they wouldn’t’uh taken muh other leg

Granny is in shock at this point. And angry, hence the biting irony. 

So, foodstamps, etc.) for performing said procedure.  She also justified her accusations against the evil doctors by comparing herself to my 14 year old cousin that has the genetic variety of diabetes (type 1) and takes excellent care of herself.

Needless to say, small town hospital.

“Just a goddamn cow

The school provided vehicles for the camp to use, talk back, do something entertainingly stupid) and wrote an anonymous summary of their comments. I did this mostly because Hamm'e had been such a bitch to me, but also because we could potentially face legal issues if she got into an accident and other kids would demand rides everywhere. The head counselors read it and Hamm'e supposedly got a 'stern' talking to, but no kind of punishment.

I don't want to cause a scene, Chubbs has apparently forgotten I complained vocally to the staff about her behaviour and beckons me over to the machine next to her.

&gt;FUCKNO

&gt;get on treadmill as far as fuck away from her as possible

Apparently this displeases Jabba, I am saved by he who shall henceforth be known as HBG [Hot Blond Guy].

&gt;[THANKYOUGREATBEETUSINTHESKY]

Apparently this isn't so bad. Chubbs gets on the treadmill on his other side. The bed of the treadmill seems to buckle under her enormous ass. Supernatural gets put back on. These machines are slightly different from the one she was on before, and the displays are different. I prefer them because they have a workout programme with your choice of Armed Forces basic training workout tests.

&gt;PLANET CHUBBS CANNOT FIGURE OUT MACHINE.

**""HAAAAY ^teehee CAN YOU HELP MEH PUT DA TEEEBEEE ORN? I DORNKNOW HOW THESE MACHINEZ WORRRK. ^tee^fucking^hee""**

She asks HBG. HBG worldessly reaches over and presses some buttons and goes back to his jog. He didn't even take his headphones out. Chubbs all but licks his arm like it's a prize roast ham. HBG is visibly disgusted. 

&gt;HBG starts chatting to me

&gt;Talk how fucking awesome Hawks are.

&gt;Stanley cup 2013

&gt;chicagopride.muthafuckas


Chubbs is not pleased that HBG is ignoring her WOMANLY CUUURFFFFS and choosing the ANOREXIC TWIGLET over her. Must have some kind of sixth sense

&gt;OHDOUBLEFUCKNO


She just manages to get a hold of it when HBG jumps away

""WTF MAN

Slobberomnomnom Milosevich has no shame. He's got the earbuds out and he's talkin to her. Apparently success.

She starts talking over him tellin him all about how she's leavin her kid's babydaddy because he's some kind of deadbeat

&gt;Manmeat to be precise.

**""YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD HANDLE A RRRREEEEEEAAAAL WUMMIN OF MUH STATUUUURE...JUST GOTTA BE GENTLE COZ I GOTSA""** [waaait for it...]

&gt;...

&gt;...


&gt;.....waiiiiit....

&gt;for

&gt;it....


**THE BEETUS. IT MESSIN WITH MY THIGHROID.""**

HBG neither believes this nor cares.

&gt;visibly irritated.

""Ma'am

THIS DISPLEASES SLOBBEROMNOMNOM MILOSEVICH aka PLANET CHUBBS. Immediately launches into tirade about how he is being a total cocktease and how it's sizist and racist that he's choosing to talk to the ""ANORECTIC SMACK ADDICT"" than to speak to a real woman like her. How clearly he is a dog with a bone.

&gt;run whiteknight.exe

""Ma'am

We walk off. Leave Chubbs screaming and raging about me being a ""SMACK HO"" and ""YER JUST RACIST AND SIZIST

We both point out to staff that she's back. Police come to escort her from building, but he seems like a nice guy. HBG turns out, is gayer than Neil Patrick Harris as Dr Frankenfurter in a Broadway musical. He felt bad that she was slagging me off and kinda wanted to rub it in her face, as he got the feeling she'd done it before. HBG and I are now friends.

************************************

Hamplanet who previously got banned from Y managed to slip in without staff realizing during a dead period and tried to be a total bitch. Was rescued by a well fit guy who white knighted the shit out of her when she was slagging me off

A little background is in order. I've been with my SO for more than 6 years now, I felt selfish not to share the amount of stupid, lazy, incredibly lard-ass, psycho and stuff from her. I mean. Why do I have to be the only one suffering from this shit?!

So, here are some:

*    Me: 25 yo

*    SO: 25 yo

*    The fat-sister (now named Sam): 19 yo

Since there's such a beautiful personality on this person, you gotta expect a lot of shit that has gone by. Like I was saying, these stories will not be sorely about FATLOGIC, because even if she uses it, there's so much more incoherence and shit that goes through her head that it can't be humanly possible be the only source of all the stupid that goes through her mouth and actions. At this point, I'll introduce..  
* **  
* **SAMLOGIC**

Without further ado

&gt;be me

&gt;introduced for the first time to my step family  

&gt;mom and dad are alright

&gt;mom is actually still pretty (awww yiiiisssss

&gt;ask my SO: ""Didn't you have a sister too?""

&gt; [tfw](/i.imgur.com/uJfwO.gif) the memories of her existance is brought back to them

&gt;ominious sounds coming from somewhere in the house

&gt;whatdidIdo... Did I summon Cthulhu or some other worldly beast?

&gt;I wish I did... nothingHasPreparedMeForThis.raw

&gt;as I watch the waves in the glass of water I am holding

&gt;""...Ph'nglui mglw'nafh... sandwich""

&gt;I turn around to behold what could have uttered such terrible words

&gt;I behold the horror. A small 12 yo, ready to rip in any food in proximity

&gt;I hide behind the counter

&gt;my SO mom says: ""Sorry

&gt; Sam: ""Nooooo. I'm huuuuuuuuuuuuuuungry. I want twooooo. ""

&gt; she opens the fridge door and grab a bottle of cocktail juice. Not those healthy orange

&gt;grabs some stuff and put it down in front of her mom

&gt; ""Sandwich..""

At this point

&gt; after letting that mayo and fatty meat in front of her mom

&gt;hear the floor creek as the extra weight is applied on the poor structure of the house

&gt;""Moooooom.. I'm huuuuuungry!"" sluuuurp ""hurry""

&gt;turns the tv to some disney channel shit

&gt;So. Did I even register in her head at this point? A new guy appear in the house and she doesn't even acknowledge me... Huh

&gt;touch the back of my head and feel the spit of the little brat

&gt;turn around and see the look of hatred on her face that I will know for the years to come

&gt;SO pulls me harder outside and closes the door

&gt;one last look to the parents

&gt;mom is still making the sandwiches

&gt;dad is lighting up a cigarette while going on the patio outside.

&gt;not a words from them

&gt;guess it will be me against the fat.

As this is just to set the tone

 I made her cry, like I didn't tell my friends of what you did and if they ever want to get close to you...)

Hope you'll enjoy it as I enjoyed venting about it.

Key for those who don't know who is who. 

&gt; **PorkPlanet:** 300+ easy, spoiled and my Housemate and self-declared ""Best Friend"". 

&gt; **KK:** Housemate, generally avoids the wrath of PorkPlanet and keeps to herself. Told me to start posting stories on this subreddit when she found it one rainy evening. No regrets. 

&gt; **AS:** Housemate

&gt; **Cuteguy:** Boyfriend. Currently engaged in a Cold War with PorkPlanet declared by her for my attention. Generally laid back and funny as hell.  

&gt; Occasionally,  our new neighbors (other students) have made an appearance in my life, also hamplanets: **RedHeadPlanet** (the chief and PorkPlanet's friend from school), **ClothesTooTightBeast** and **WhisperingBeast**. 

&gt;Lastly


----------

My faithful readers. I am terrible sorry for my long gaps in posting stories. The problem is, and into PorkPlanets wrath, as of a few weeks ago (my return depicted in [The Neighbours](http://en.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1i6uty/porkplanet_housemate_chapter_eight_the_neighbours/)). Since I have been back, all I've been doing is working  working working and going on incredibly long and exhausting Bike Rides with Cuteguy in this incredible heat we've had in the UK. 

**Also, as well as work harder than ever to tone up. I'm told this may take a while as the last stretch of weight loss is always the hardest, but I'm keeping Halloween as my goal date in my minds eye, since it was then last year I decided to lose this weight. It should be achievable once my hand is 100% healed and my pins removed, as well as this pesky achy back I keep having. Wish me luck. 

Here is a story from when Myself, Her boyfriend (Nick), AS and PorkPlanet went on a last-minute vacation to Benidorm, Spain a few weeks ago. It was a fucking nightmare. This story is based on the last (fourth) night. PorkPlanet gets drunk and massively fucks up. 

------------------------

The Holiday had been fine during the days, being a magnified, sunburned version of herself in a foreign place, would get drunk and ruin the evening with her mouth. This story occurred on our final night. 

During the day, but CuteGuy was pretty horrified. Her obvious disdain that I was wearing a Bikini set the tone for the rest of the afternoon because she was being a major bitch. 

&gt; In Bar downstairs from Apartment/Hotel building. 

&gt; PorkPlanet is hammered drunk. 

&gt; Some sleazy Spanish dude all over her. 

&gt; Cuteguy wants to go back to Apartment. 

&gt; Not sure if I should leave. 

&gt; AS: Don't worry, KK and Nick will keep an eye on her even if we're a bit drunk, we have to be up early so we wont be late.

&gt; Nick: Teehee I wanna see if she actually has sex. 

&gt; Me: Ew. 

&gt; Me and Cuteguy leave. 

&gt; In Apartment in bedroom. 

&gt; 20 minutes later

&gt; Bang on our bedroom door. 

&gt; It's AS

&gt; She walks in. 

&gt; AS: Sorry I had to leave them there and come back.

&gt; Me: What's the matter? 

&gt; Porkplanet is down there talking shit about you and Cuteguy. 

&gt; Cuteguy: What on earth is she saying about me? 

&gt; AS: That you were checking out HER and KK at the beach. She's hammered. She thinks you were checking out her legs and how men just can't handle themselves sometimes around bigger women. I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING THESE ARE HER WORDS. She also said ImGonnaMakeIt should of been wearing a swimsuit also because the bikini was not modest and she didn't look good

&gt; I burst into hysterics laughing.  

&gt; Cuteguy: Oh god oh god

&gt; Me: What? 

&gt; Cuteguy: I'm never gonna be able to have sex again with that mental image in my head. I was looking at her garden hedge because it was right in my face

&gt; We're all in hysterics. 

&gt; AS: Can I sleep in here? They are gonna be back soon and I think she's bringing that weirdo back

&gt; Me: Sure go and sleep on the sofa bed. (There's a sofa bed in our bedroom).

&gt; AS: Ok but promise you wont bang until I am passed out. No more trauma from this holiday please

&gt; Cuteguy: I just said I'm never gonna be able to have sex again after what PorkPlanet said and I meant it. 

&gt; We're all now in hysterics. 

Roughly half hour later. 

&gt; Earthquake approaching from down the hall. 

&gt; Sounds like someone fell through apartment door

&gt; Hear porkplanet and her amigo enter her and AS's bedroom next door. 

&gt; KK and Nick go into their room down the hall. 

&gt; Lots of banging and laughing happening next door

&gt; Sweet silence. 

&gt; Then

&gt; Oh god then. 

&gt; The howling. 

&gt; The screeching.  

&gt; The banging. 

&gt; Either they're having sex or she's being slaughtered for some kind of sacrificial offering. 

&gt; AS: Oh god. 

&gt; Cuteguy is hysterically laughing into his pillow. 

&gt; Me: AS come here. 

&gt; AS climbs into bed next to me. I am inbetween her and Cuteguy. 

&gt; I am holding AS close as the big spoon.  

&gt; AS: I am scared

&gt; We wince every time a howl or bang is made. 

&gt; I put my hands over AS's ears. 

&gt; Cuteguy has his hands over my ears. 

&gt; He  is still hysterically laughing behind me. 

&gt; What are our lives? 

&gt; After about 10 minutes

&gt; Peace at last. 

&gt; Cuteguy climbs into AS's sofa bed

5 hours later. Time to get up for flight home. 

&gt; Knock on door. 

&gt; AS being closest to door opens it still laying in bed. 

&gt; PorkPlanet looks awful. Been crying. 

&gt; Me: What's the matter? 

&gt; PorkPlanet: He's gone. 

&gt; AS: And? We're going too in 45 minutes. 

&gt; Me: If you're going to keep having one night stands

&gt; PorkPlanet: He took some of our stuff. 

&gt; AS: WHAT STUFF. 

&gt; PorkPlanet: Money

&gt; Me: What?! 

&gt; AS (fuming

&gt; PorkPlanet (crying): Yeah he took all of our money and most of my Jewelry. 

&gt; AS: PORKPLANET I HAD ABOUT 300 EURO LEFT I WAS GOING TO EXCHANGE AT THE AIRPORT. AND MY TIFANNY BRACELET WAS IN THERE. 

&gt; Cuteguy can't contain his laughter from over the other side of the room. 

&gt; [AS's face when our holiday is ruined in the final hour.](http://images.wikia.com/glee/images/f/fc/Cry-laguna-beach-lauren-conrad-lc-sad-Favim.com-240279.gif)

Luckily

AS and PorkPlant still haven't spoken since the holiday. Don't think there friendship will ever repair itself after this. She's not in anyones good books this summer.

1375652561.0,1jp9gq,The Trihamthlete.,EATthrowaway,383,66,54,"So, followed by a 112 mile bike ride, shout a number at us

The Trihamthlete is a rather tall lady, whilst not yet the interstellar bodies described in this sub, she is more rotund than anyone else I know in Scouts and Guides, probably clocking in at a UK 20 or a US 24. I would guess her weight to be in the upper 200lbs. [Basically this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-3819-body-shape.htm?StartAt=9#.Uf6-NtKTj44) She didn't smell, she seemed clean, none of the usual HP shit, just a larger middle-aged lady. 

When we arrived on site, due to bevvies last night, my travel sickness and the awful driving of my mate. When the Trihamthlete saw this, she tutted, rolled her eyes, gathered up all of her shit and waddled towards our bag section. Fair enough, you can disapprove of the hungover teenage girl, she'll have to be jumping about for a little bit before she would get a chance to use said chair and she's IN THE WAY. One of the Men In Charge (MICs) tell her this, I need my chair here! I'm a volunteer

We work things out, and surprise, surprise, Trihamthlete is supposed to do 300-400. I ended up doing 100-400, after half an hour of irate athletes. Too late to moan about her, better just getting on with it. 

At one point, and stand there as he digs through the bag,  before a look of confusion crosses his face. 

""What's up

""Nothing

We laugh it off

I turn to put his bag back

""Erm, not really believing what I'm seeing, ""Did you take those jelly beans out of an athlete's bag?""

""^teehee Well, he won't need it, so I thought I could use it to pick my energy up so I don't pass out from all the work we've been doing"" 

I'm normally not the type to speak like this but I can't abide shit done to innocent people. 

""Triham, you've not even burnt off a tictac, let alone a bag of jelly beans. Have you taken anything else?"" 

""Just a few things, it's not my fault I need to eat!"" 

""WHAT THINGS? IF YOU NEED TO EAT

""Just a few of those energy bars

&gt;Each of those bars is 250 calories. When she says a few, man, one is basically a meal. 

I can't take any more, where there is nothing calorific enough for her to steal. 

I pass the rest of the day angry but in peace.",self,t5_2vzax,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1jp9gq/the_trihamthlete/

**A disclaimer. This FPS is very much so NSFL

&gt;Be me. 
&gt;Winding down to the last hour of my 7PM-7AM night shift. The incoming day shift nurses are scattered around the nurses station getting report from the night shift. Several physicians are doing rounds with their staff. The ICU is bustling with activity.

&gt;The air begins to thicken like a strawberry milkshake. The ground shakes just once due to some unknown event. The hair on the back of everyone’s neck begins to stand up. Sounds begin to dull to a quiet roar. A muffled shout is heard in the distance.

&gt;Suddenly, and we hear “Code Blue! Intermediate Care Unit Room #___” being screamed through the PA. 

A code blue means that a patient is in the process of dying/entered cardiac arrest/ has become unresponsive/little or no vital signs/etc... 
It’s not good. One for the patient
The Intermediate Care Unit was right next door to us and was for patients that are too sick for the Floor

&gt;The doors burst open and in wheels the instrument of my jimmies demise...Ham Fountain!

&gt;Ham Fountain was ginormous. 
500+ lbs of fermenting bulbous ham being wheeled in on a bariatric bed (the biggest possible hospital beds) that barely fit through the hallways. 

&gt;Being right at shift change and in the middle of physician rounds we had a veritable dream team of health professionals right there. There was literally no better time for something to have gone wrong.

We’re all going to make it!

&gt;I start getting the patient transferred over into the system and relay barked orders from 8 different physicians to the other hospital departments. In a feat of cooperation and teamwork like I have never seen Ham Fountain is revived. Everyone is working like a well oiled machine! 

Then

&gt;Ham Fountain was admitted to the IMCU with Diverticulitis. Now...not all people who have diverticulitis have crappy diets or are obese...but a lot of people who have crappy diets and are obese have diverticulitis. See what I did there?


**TL:DR If you don't eat enough fiber in your diet to keep things moving through your intestines on a daily basis...hard substances like nuts or seeds that don't fully digest will sit in your gut and slowly rub a sore (diverticuli) into the wall of the intestine which can get infected (diverticulitis) [which can burst and then you die from internal bleeding](http://i.imgur.com/1rE6pQG.gif).**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis

**Which is exactly what happened next!!!** 

There...I saved you from having to read the sordid details. So if you have no jimmies left to spare today, or simply do anything, **ANYTHING** other than read what I am about to describe next.**

.


*Every sentence and picture from here out should be considered NSFL and probably NSFW.*

**You have been warned!!!**


&gt;Ham Fountain’s diverticulitis...was from decades of shitty eating and neglect. 
He had just had his 40th birthday colonoscopy

&gt;Then he had to follow a strict diet for the rest of his life and take extra care for his digestive health. 

Being an FPS do you guys think [he followed it?](http://i.imgur.com/ctgRlSS.gif)

&gt;Immediately after his surgery he ordered a massive haul of fast food to be sent to the room instead of eating his prescribed liquid diet. No one knew how he got it in there or who even brought it to him. Buckets of chicken and bags of burgers. He ate all of it as quickly as he could so the nurse couldn’t see it and hid the garbage behind a room chair (they found it later). This being a fresh surgery to his colon he started having severe abdominal pressure and pain. Instead of calling the nurse (like a 5 year old afraid of getting in trouble) he gets up to try to use the bathroom. The amount of straining he had to do in order to push that massive boulder of greasy protein fast food shit past the narrowed section of colon caused the band to burst and his colon to rupture and then he started to bleed internally.

From my understanding
because all of your blood is backing up from your ass to your stomach.

&gt;When the nurse came in to do a vital signs check

&gt;She screamed down the hallway for help and slammed the Code Blue button on the wall....

My fellow curvy Redditors have demanded part 2

To recap: A story of my 18 year old, beta female friends in various flavors of chocolate. The setting is a store similar to Walmart in midwest Michigan, within my first couple of weeks on the job working as a 3rd shift shelf stocker. My dear friend, T, a petite, cute 18 year old fellow shelf stocker had just been berated by Lardquisha and had gone to the back of the stockroom to contemplate her life and feel thankful for not being eaten alive. 

At this point in the story, and being ratchety as hell throughout the store at the top of their lungs. I thought Lardquisha was only in for some soda for her achey breaky, shugah-deprived thighroid since she didn’t make the “hell-ty” choice and got diet Pepsi at Taco Bell earlier in the evening. In short, Lardquisha needs sum beetus juice.

My aisle is strewn with cases of product to be put on the shelf


&gt;Be me


&gt;Listening to Lardquisha and Moons meander through the store


&gt;Be trying to keep my trolley from rolling towards her gravitational pull


&gt;Suddenly notice the footfalls seem to be increasing in intensity


&gt;My adrenaline begins to spike for the second time in half an hour


&gt;I move to the opposite end of the aisle


&gt;Time slows as Lardquisha turns the corner


&gt;She exclaims to one of her moons, it became apparent, and Lardquisha was at her wit’s end


&gt;Moon complains that her knees hurt from all the walking


&gt;I take a moment to admire Lardquisha’s alpha skillz


&gt;As Lardquisha turns the corner and faces me dead on


&gt;The light from the discount jewelry case and the florescent lighting is amplified


&gt;Until this point I had never heard the term “ashy


&gt;My naïve mind assumes there was a bonfire


&gt; For the first time I get a full on view of Lardquisha


&gt;My initial observations turn to her utter lack of calf muscles


&gt;Like an upside-down pear


&gt;A massive pot belly


&gt;My height advantage allowed me to see the 2 feet of wobbly cleavage


&gt;Behold! The bejeweled cell phone sinking ever lower into the crevasse


&gt;Each step brought majestic jiggle’s to the layers of lard filled curves


&gt;Her arms swinging horizontally above her sidefolds


&gt;The aforementioned stretch marks making an appearance at the bottom of the gut with each step


&gt;I note in amazement that some designer had made a new color specifically for this jumpsuit


&gt;Lardquisha is dripping


&gt;Lardquisha advances


&gt;Lardquisha becomes enraged with the fact that she has to walk another thirty feet to the other end of the aisle, each weighing no more than a couple of pounds, out of her way


&gt;Wait


&gt;unbemuthafuckinleivable.jpg


&gt;”Sumbitch


&gt;I note a moon pushing Lardquisha’s cart, at least 10 full 2-liters of off-brand grape and red pop/drank each and 2 empties (already sacrificed to Lardquisha’s thighroid), and a mound of jumbo marshmallows. Oh and BBQ chips, 10-15 family bags, store brand


&gt;reinforcingracialstereotypes.ftw


&gt;Lardquisha homes in on my terrified


&gt;But sweet justice is around the corner


&gt;Meanwhile


&gt;ihaveahunchshemeanttobeoverheard.avi


&gt;[MFW](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsyw15zXoN1qbq017o1_500.gif) there was a perfectly clear path down the center of the aisle for her to walk on


&gt;Some god was watching out for ConfectionAffection that day


&gt;As Lardquisha pulled back her right toothpick to kick the next case in line


&gt;The kick landed


&gt;The case remained stable


&gt;Forward was the direction in which Lardquisha toppled, the industrial shelving letting out a blood-curdling screech but holding by another act of some god


&gt;Lardquisha’s impact shook the store


&gt;I began a maniacal laugh


&gt;The San Andreas fault shifted at that moment


&gt;Bottles of berber-cue fell into her weave from the shelf above


&gt;”Oh sheeeeeeyit!” exclaimed the moons


&gt;Lardquisha began to inhale, began a tirade the likes of which I had never heard before


&gt;”YOU WANNA GO


&gt;And so on


&gt;And so on


&gt;[MFW](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9wtwxveJv1rqfhi2o1_500.gif)

This has become too long, and my unwitting coming out story will be contained in the final part three. Stay tuned, and if you read this far I hope you enjoyed it! I have so many of these, having a blast writing them!

TL;DR Dark chocolate hambeast Lardquisha gets some liquid beetus for her thyroid, and blames me with a tirade the likes of which I had never experienced full of excuses and fatty logic.

If anybody can think of other examples that are not related to the ones written below

**The Physiology**

1\. ""I am unhealthy

&gt;My body is perfectly fine. You can't say anything to me because you're not a doctor. If you are a doctor

2\. Having a medical ""condition"" is a blank check to do nothing and eat as much as you want. It requires neither a formal diagnosis nor a measured treatment plan. Serious conditions, just medication. Having a condition makes even mild hunger a life or death situation. Having a condition will always trump the laws of thermodynamics, so weight loss is impossible even under the most strict diet. Two opposing conditions can't cancel each other out. They can only magnify the hunger.

&gt;Muh blood sugah was low

&gt;My body requires more calories than other people because it is so big. I'm fat because my metabolism is too slow. I have a condition. Pass the syrup.

3\. Being fat is a more important disability than all other disabilities.

&gt;You're a paraplegic? Walk it off

4\. The morbidly obese are not bigger than normal people because they are fat. That's a lie perpetuated by the BMI. They just have big skeletal frames and weigh more than normal people because muscle weighs more than fat.

&gt;This is not fat. This is muscle. I'm big-boned and I have too many muscles

5\. Exercise is dangerous to your health. Exercise makes your heart work too hard and lifting weights tears your muscle fibers. Apparently this damage is irreparable.

&gt;Sorry

6\. If bathing and wiping becomes physically challenging

&gt;Yay! I found the box of milk duds I lost two months ago! It was hiding in one of my folds!

**The Feels**

7\. Fatties hate to fat alone.

&gt;I need people to be fat with me because it is the only outlet I have for being social. Eating is the only activity I know and love. You better not try to lose weight or you're gonna make me look bad. Turning down an offer of food is a treasonous act of war and I am General Fatton.

8\. A fatty is never too big. Everything else is too small. Holding a fat person accountable for the damages and inconveniences caused directly by their body's immense size is fat discrimination. Everyone should have pre-emptively built/moved/reinforced everything to accommodate for their size

&gt;It's not my fault that I don't know the dimensions of my body. Plane seats are getting smaller. My clothes are shrinking. This chair must've been made out of toothpicks. I'm a healthy person in a world built for anorexics.

9\. Big is more ""beautiful"" than beautiful. A skinny person should never turn down a fat person's romantic advances. Conversely

&gt;Men like meat. Dogs like bones. I like cake and men with chiseled abs. Teehee.

10\. Anger towards the obese is *always* rooted in jealousy or envy.

&gt;Don't be mad just 'cause I broke yo chair. Y'all just hatin' 'cause you wish you could have these currrrves.

11\. Size discrimination is a one-way road.

&gt;Nobody wants to work with skinny bitches. You're just a skinny bitch who hates me because I'm a ""real"" woman. What? You can't report me to HR for making fun of your weight!  I'm going to report you first

12\. Only fat people can be beautiful on the inside. Thin people never have to work for anything or develop their personalities

&gt;Skinny people can never understand me because they're not fat. They're too busy starving themselves and being worthless assholes with nothing to contribute to society. I hate skinny people and I wish all of them would shut up and die. *Sigh.* If only they weren't so stupid and put off by my weight

**The Food**

13\. Being fat makes you an authority on everyone else's health and nutritional needs.

&gt;""You should let me have that slice of cake because it'll just make you fat if you eat it. I'm looking out for you. Also

14\. Vegetables are ""rabbit food"" and eating them for even a single meal will send you down the path towards becoming dangerously anorexic

&gt;What is this? Spinach? There better be a baconator hiding at the bottom of this. How am I supposed to get full off of this stuff?

15\. Everything a parent knows about nutrition is always the correct interpretation. They grew up at a time when everyone was skinnier

&gt;When I was a kid we used to eat all kinds of candy and junk food and run all over the neighborhood getting into all kinds of trouble... what's that, of course we're stopping for McDonalds on the way. Ask your baby sister how many orders of nuggets she wants. Make sure you roll her over before we leave so she doesn't get any bedsores this time.

16\. A healthy diet is whatever you feel like eating

&gt;Gimme two orders of double-fried pork rings and an order of bacon-battered butter bombs - with the russian style dressing - and a triple-quarter-pounder patty-melt with the french fries, battered jalapeno poppers and deep-fried sweet potato tots stuffed in a footlong loaf of garlic bread and make sure it's got extra EXTRA mayo on it this time. Oh, and gimme a diet coke.

17\. Crash diets are bad. Therefore

&gt;Counting calories is something only anorexics do. Are you anorexic? Denying yourself calories will only make following your diet harder and you'll end up cheating on it even more. That's why 95% of all diets fail. You're just going to gain it all back. Just give up already.

18\. The calories don't count if you don't write them down in your food diary and nobody sees you eat them.

&gt;""Weight Watchers says that coffee has no calories! That means if I blend a brownie into it and fill it with heavy whipping cream

19\. Promising to start your diet tomorrow means you can eat whatever you want today.

&gt;I swear

20\. If a diet makes you lose weight

&gt;""I'm doing the ketogenic, liquid, pH, Atkins, cookie diet. I mixed them all together into one. I'll just follow a different one every day so I don't get bored and I'll be losing weight in no time!""

21\. Any form of exercise deserves an immediate reward containing at least as many calories as you burned

&gt;It's ok if I have this pint of Ben n Jerry's

22\. There's an anti-consumerist food conspiracy out there keeping us fat. All food is unhealthy because companies want you to be fat. There's fat-making particles in all food. Even our air is making us fat! There are no healthy options

1368912002.0,1elhbr,Waddle goes to Baltimore,CitizenTed,384,73,58,"My friend and ex-coworker recently wrote a story about Waddle crapping his pants on a business trip. It's time for me to write about my first (and last) business trip with Waddle. 

Some Waddle background: he's fat, dumb and irritating. He works in sales but has a nasty habit of boring everyone to death. He never shuts up and because his life is straight-laced and uneventful, his anecdotes are all mind-numbingly boring despite the fact that he punctuates them with guffaws of excitement. 

So anyway, should get more sales experience at trade shows. I was to travel with Waddle to Baltimore for a two-day trade show. I was booking airfare when Waddle burst in and insisted that he take care of all the details. 

He ends up booking us a 5:00am flight even though there was a 9:00am flight that would have left us plenty of time. He then books our hotel room. Not rooms, we were saving $27 a night. I told him I'd gladly pay the $27 out of my own pocket if it meant I had a modicum of privacy. Waddle then flips out and goes crying the ops manager, who grudgingly admits it ""saves money"". We'd be sharing a room. 

Why this was so important to him

So I get up at 3:00am to make the fucking flight. Arriving at the airport

Once we get on the plane

The whole flight he kept interrupting me with stupid shit

When we get to the hotel

All settled in

It's a crab shack. We're in Baltimore. World-famous crab cakes. But no. It was too ""negro"" for pasty white suburban Waddle to handle. And he has the company card

I asked him if he was really going to eat at some idiotic chain joint when we were in the epicenter of America's finest seafood joints. Yes. It was ESPN Zone or I pay myself and explain to the boss why I needed reimbursement from an expense report when Waddle was being all reasonable with the company card. To ESPN Zone we went. 

I hated it. I hate sports. I hate chain restaurants. I hate drunk idiots hooting at the TV set. The food was greasy

The trade show was a bust. Our sad pipe-and-drape display wasn't catching any interest, and the specs of everything we make. Waddle was spewing ridiculous bullshit to everyone. He had no clue. He honestly believed that his ""positive sales aspect"" was carrying the day and impressing everyone. People streamed away from our booth like it emitted chlorine gas. 

Another evening, but only tentatively. It had to pass his smell test. We walked up and down the streets. We inpected the menus at all sorts of interesting-looking places. None met his needs. After 90 minutes of this stalemate, Waddle steers us back toward the waterfront where he spies a Cheescake Factory. 

Because I had ""failed"" to find a worthwhile place, the awful atmosphere and the terrible food at Cheesecake Factory really pissed me off. I refused to speak to Waddle as he reeled off stupid anecdote after stupid anecdote. 

Back at the hotel

Next day, all night. Eventually I shut Waddle down. The stream of bullshit stopped. 

Next morning we flew home in silence. I went home and enjoyed blessed solitude. 

Next day at work, not nationally. This gave him so pause, so I stepped up. These were conditions of my continued employment. NEVER. AGAIN. PERIOD. 

Though I went on many company-wide business strips

Fuck that guy.

While I was a teenager, in shape, goes for a walk every morning, generally walks everywhere, loves to be on his feet, etc. I'll call him Walker

The woman, well over 400 pounds, [close to this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-2496-body-shape.htm#img) but shorter and with lots more sag due to age. She did nothing but eat, and eat terribly, never liked to walk anywhere or even stand for any extended period of time. She had high blood pressure but did nothing about her weight to help it. I'll refer to her as Saturn since apparently Walker liked it enough to put a ring on it.

Anyways he mentioned his uncle in a few of his stories which I didn't take seriously.  His uncle is 300 lb of man muscle, thinking, damn, I want to hurt my back.  

So one day, I just head over.   I get to his house, and ring the bell, nobody answers.   I call him.   ""Oh I'm in the trailer behind the house, come over.""

Nothing prepared me for this.  Evidently its his uncles trailer, and has not vacuumed once.   I yell for my buddy and he responds from down the trailer hall.  I shuffle through the beer cans to the bathroom, where fatilus has had an accident.  

evidently he was attempting to take a shower, he was 400 lb of blob.   There is water everywhere from the shower being left on for god knows how long.   Its soaked the carpet into a marsh stew of steam, and weed smell.   This was the Vietnam jungle.

We spent the next 10 minutes struggling in swamp carpet, sitting on his bed, and I left straight away.  

I dont think I'll ever forget plunging my hands into the backroll of a wet, clue me in.  

What rustles me the most is knowing that his weed smoking beer drinking 15 year long pizza binge is funded by people paying taxes for disability, as long as you don't believe a word he says.

After Abandoning TubbyLumpkins to her herd

Now, that TubbyLumpkins fell to the 'Beetus', and everyone lived happily ever after. 

As I sit here and type this I am deeply saddened about what happened after that trip. 

BondageFairy patched things up with her parents and came down to the city at the end of January. I saw Tubkins briefly on Jan 2 to pick up our gear from the freight Depo. Not much was said

BF and I picked up work in our respective fields pretty quickly and we decided to become room mates. It worked well

We rented a little flat in St Kilda

She had also developed a real ""cheese tooth""

We were still feeling the gravity waves from FudgePumpkin's presence in our lives as well. Due to her shenanigans on the trip it had blown our budget and both BF and I had a sizable credit card debt to pay off. We pressed Tubby for her share

I kicked and swore about it but really I didn't want anything more to do with that awful hambeast

I helped out when I could


For fast forward to about April / May. 

BF and I are doing out ""shift change"" one Friday night

As we are talking she casually mentions she is going out Saturday night. She has the night off work and she is going to a party.

Then she drops casually that TubbyLumpkins was coming

She days Whumpus is having a hard time meeting people / making friends in Melbourne and is kind of lonely. BF feels a bit sorry for her

I really wish I knew then

It was at that party that BF met the ""man"" I will call ButtMonkey. Buttmonkey was related to Whumpus somehow

ButtMonkey wasn't fat, awful people. 

The ButtMonkey supercluster consisted of mum (Ham Planet Prime)

They all lived in the one house out in the Eastern Burbs of Melbourne. 

Well BF saw something attractive in ButtMonkey

He picked my brains about it

He was also a classic abuser and make BF think she was the center of the universe

In the first 3 months of their dating

I confronted her about all this

That was her first use of fat logic. 

She gave me an ultimatum. Either I accept and like ButtMonkey

My brass balls clanged and I said in that case we were done. I started making plans to move out and she was spending all her time at ButtMonkey's house. She was now trapped in the gravity field of the White Trash Super Cluster. 

Whompus herself was forced to move back to Perth around then

She flew back to Perth and her MotherPlanet got her

BF and I parted ways. I got my own place

I never gave up on BF, tearful conversations I had with TBD and VM because she refused to speak to them, because the also did not like ButtMonkey. 

I did get a rambling hate filled FB message from her a few years ago. I think she was drunk when she wrote it. 

She rambled about how she was super happy

I think she was trying to convince herself more than anything.

As for me, and did my best to make everyone happy.  

That man died somewhere out in the desert. I liken it to a Time lord regeneration. The old one dies

After dealing with TubbyLumpkins and the nightmare week that was

Because of those standards I have never had an experience like that again. It gave me the tools I needed to say no. 

So while Tubbylumpkins gravity sucked BF down to her doom

So this is the end. 

It is not a happy ending

The truth is

Take care

So some background... this lady

The first few weeks went fine. It was awesome having two families live together even if it was in such a small house. However

So me and my mother had just gone grocery shopping. Since we had a second family staying with us (they were a family of five but had an infant) we stocked up with a lot more food than usual. So my mother and I put the groceries away and go to bed. That night we hear somebody lumbering around the kitchen but this isn't unusual as my uncle's family just came from overseas and their internal clocks are still a little wacked.
Side note: we are a low income family
So next morning I wake up. Go to kitchen to make breakfast for everyone as usual. I open the fridge door and I'm jolted awake. Dafuq?  The fridge is empty. Literally empty except for a couple of lemons and half empty containers. We  had filled up the fridge with enough food to last our two families a week. It was gone. Aunt Piggy comes down the stairs just then. 

Me: ""Hey Aunt Piggy did your kids take anything from the fridge last night?""

Aunt Piggy: ""Oh teehee me and the kids just had a little midnight snack"". 

Now

This was nothing compared to what this woman would do in the coming months. 
She would constantly scream at my mother (my uncle was her brother) about trying to get her (Aunt Piggy) and my uncle divorced. 
She destroyed our furniture. She would rip our couches and chairs when we weren't home. 
She would beat her children daily (something we didn't discover until a couple of days before she left). 
She and her children would consume mass quantities of food for the whole duration of their stay. It got so ridiculous we had to start hiding food in our own house

We went nearly broke because this damn Hamplanet would eat so much food.
They also used up huge amounts of water and electricity. A couple months after they arrived we got a call from the city asking us to check if we had a broken pipe due to the amount of water our household (a.k.a Aunt Piggy) was using.

~~Let me know if you like to hear~~ Will write more!

- 2 12 packs of mini cupcakes 
- 1 giant bag of peanut mm's
- a carton of kit Kats (yes. A carton.) 
- liter of Beetus major 
- And 4 boxes of little Debbie Cakes

Before I could say anything I literally was bounced out of the way by the equator of her mouth breathing offspring

FM must have ""ran"" to get a forgotten item. My neck tingles at the whiplash and my mind in awe of my airborne trajectory.

She was carrying ANOTHER LITER of beetus juice and the biggest snickers bar I have ever seen. Which she is waving triumphantly at her mother. 

FM is even BIGGER than TF and complained that the snacks they bought for the car ride home was not enough and she had to have a snickers bar. She even said to gain the upper hand

TF eyes wide in pure sugar high shook her head no.  (while the cashier was beginning to ring in the items

Turning around FM whimpered and looked down at her rejected snickers bar. She then opened the gigantic candy bar and ate that thing like a slut chuggs some D. There's no other way to describe how grotesque or glorious it was to witness that.

To cover up the fact that she had just eaten it anyways FM scrambles to open the mm's in order to (I assume) eat a few and throw off her mothers suspicion of where that king size candy bar could have possibly gone...

her hurculean strength had burst open the mm bag and the entire contents went flying! Raining mms on the floor and a few impressively in the air. 

TF in shock starts choking on her Debbie cakes and reaches to open the liter of Beetus Major that FM went to retrieve because it hasn't been bagged yet. 

The Beetus Major shaken up from FM ""running"" back to the register, her mumu, her gaggle of fupas, and onto the floor. 

I glanced at the cashier

*Real Ending*
As I suddenly was witnessing a GGW wet t shirt try out that no one signed up for

faster then the cashier could say ""clean up at register 10"" ThunderFupa and Fupulous Minor rolled to their knees and began frantically

It was then when I glanced over at the cashier...and as I lowered my 2 items to the ground with her nod of approval did I look over and realize  I was witnessing the Hamplanet Heisman. 

Mother ThunderFupa and Daughter Fupulous 
Weren't just picking the mms up. They were eating them. 


TLDR: ThunderFupa and Fupulous Minor literally consumed and showered in their hamplanet snacks raining down on them

Bros that are starting their weight loss, it may even be a girlfriend or boyfriend. That is why it is dangerous. By counting calories, you are already more knowledgeable about weight loss than 95% of people out there. They will constantly throw fat acceptance and broscience at you. If you ever tell anyone you are losing weight, or they notice, they will offer unsolicited advice; most of it complete bullshit. Most of it from fatties. They will do everything in their power to keep you down at their level. They suffer the same hunger pangs that you do, and they know which buttons to push to make you want to eat.



Here are some things that i had to endure constantly


""You are barely eating at all and i am concerned""

""I think you may be anorexic""

""Don't change i like you just the way you are""

""I like guys/girls with a little meat on their bones""

""Just one won't hurt your diet or make you fat""

""If you eat less than X calories in a day

""But you are already skinny""

""That's not fat that's loose skin""

""You can't lose weight unless you eat 6 small meals a day""

""You are looking so unhealthy

""You should eat healthy like me""

""You can't lose weight eating that""

""You looked better before""

""That only works for you because you are young. Just wait til you hit 30. It is all coming back""

""All that running is so unhealthy for your joints""

""If you consume less calories than you burn

""it makes me sad that you hate yourself so much that you feel the need to do this. You should learn to love your body like me""

""I heard of this guy once who ran marathons all his life and he just keeled over dead of a heart attack! Running is too dangerous""

Etc.


I have flipped out on people before for doing things like that


IT may feel sometimes like everyone is against you. Sometimes you will be surrounded by people that ARE against you. All telling you that the things you have been doing that have caused your current weight loss actually don't work and you must be bulimic or on meth or whatever.

&gt; First day: Snack was fruit cups to go with our tropical theme. Baconator doesn't waste time on fruit so it was fine (too much sugar for her probably)


&gt;Second Day: Snack was pretzels (airline stewardess theme) Baconator eats 4 full bags of pretzels that night

&gt; baconator secretly vows to try harder. EAT ALL THE FOOD!


&gt; Preference Day: Last and most important day of the week. Day people and chapters pick their new members to give bids out to.

&gt;  chapter loved me. Who doesn't love cupcakes?

&gt;""Just like you're respecting me and myyyy boyfriend by throwing your fat ass at him? You're so ugly and desperate

&gt;""He's not with you anymore! You were the one sleeping with someone else!""

&gt;And she says it

&gt;Oh god I can feel it coming in the air tonight

&gt;Hold on

&gt;""Well

&gt;I stand there for a moment

&gt;Smugly she picks up a sandwich on the station and takes a huge bite

&gt;But you don't understand

&gt;I go to Catholic school

&gt;I can shiv a bitch with a crucifix at a thousand paces

&gt;So I act like the sneaky angry heartbroken motherfucker than I am and I punch her right in the diaphragm

&gt;My punches are no joke

&gt;Fatty starts to choke on the sandwich

&gt;Doubles over

&gt;Nasty mascara and eyeliner clumps start to run and smudge

&gt;""You fat cunt

&gt;And guess what?

&gt;She didn't.

&gt;...for the rest of the day.
 
That's not the end of the story though. I told Jim about what had happened, and I could *not* keep it to myself. So we moved on.
 
Or so I thought.
 
Fast forward a few months later. Last day of school, and I was in a super great mood.
 
Until.
 
&gt;I hear rumbling outside

&gt;Strange

&gt;Must be a 16-wheeler trying to come down the street

&gt;Think nothing of it

&gt;Go down the steps

&gt;No one in sight

&gt;Suddenly

&gt;Fuuuuuck!

&gt;Fall on the cement hard

&gt;RIP tights

&gt;I hear

&gt;*tee-hee-hee*

&gt;I get up and there is Becca

&gt;50 more pounds to hate

&gt;Also has two idiot-looking girls with her and 1 guy

&gt;The trio have their fists up and they don't look happy

&gt;I am sorry

&gt;I don't say a word. I lunge for them

&gt;This is a violent city and I know how to fight like a maniac

&gt;Immediately dispatch the guy with hard kick to the balls

*^(^Sorry ^for ^every ^male ^who ^had ^to ^read ^that)*

&gt;He starts throwing up

&gt;Dispatch the next two girls rather quickly

&gt;One runs away crying that she didn't get paid enough for this

&gt;Just Beck-ham and I now

&gt;She lets out a whale song of unimaginable terror and rage

&gt;Bitch

&gt;She tries to run away

&gt;LOL

&gt;I'm on the track team

&gt;Take like three steps and outrun her

&gt;And I let her have it.

&gt;Can't punch her diaphragm now

&gt;Jesus god her breath is foul

&gt;Whatever

&gt;Split her lip and give her a black eye

&gt;She can't even raise her arm up

&gt;""Assault!"" she whines

&gt;That fucking smell

&gt;Eh

&gt;Two black eyes

&gt;For symmetry

&gt;She wails and whales

&gt;""Are you done?!"" I shout

&gt;She nods

&gt;""Done with what

&gt;""I'm not faaaaaaaaat!""

&gt;I start laughing. She is enraged but I don't care.

&gt;""Promise you'll leave us alone. Next time I'll call the cops. We have all those messages you sent us. You'll be done.""

&gt;She realizes she's pinned and agrees

&gt;Pick up my backpack and waltz off like a proud motherfucker

&gt;If she's Beck-ham then I'm Wayne Rooney

&gt;And she did not come back for more.

Alright! Lets get started!

We had a couple of pretty gnarly storms that passed though here. One of them ripped apart my fence, so I decided to wait till the weekend to grab supplies and fix the place up. 

Saturday morning I drove out, and trying to figure the best way to rebuilt the thing. After a couple hours, I notice Sunflower peeking though the gaps.

Sunflower: ""Hey Wolfsong. Your dog got out and followed me home."" At this moment

Me:""Oh! Sorry there Sunflower. Did she follow you back?""

Sun: ""No
And then she took off. 

[MFW I couldn't figure out the wait time](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marty-McFly-What.gif). It would work though

40 minutes later I dust off, she greeted me with a giant, wet, bearhug. 

[MFW the smell lingers](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gag.gif). 

Hammila ""Oh, put on a nice top when I invite you over for coffee.""

Me: ""Oh! I just came by to pick up Chell. Sorry she ran over here

At this point, and sweat. That split second that I was noticing the house, was the second that Hammila grabbed my hands. 

Hammila: ""Next time, since you'a young and was raised in the generation of selfishness. Annnnyway, come in.""

[MFW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bitch.gif)

I wanted to tell her that I didn't have the time for coffee, covered in a huge stain. She sat down, and barked for Sunflower to bring us coffee. 

Sunflower scurried in

[I seriously considered this as an alternative to drinking the coffee](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mats3g25Si1qjfrswo1_500.gif)

Hammila:""Oh

Me: ""Oh

Hammila:""Now Wolf, look at how you came over today.""

At this moment

Me: ""Well

Hammila:""Don't get all upset, and find you a man that likes real women.""

Me:""Don't worry

Hammila: ""NO! DON'T YAH DARE GET THAT DOG SUNFLOWER. Now

At this point

Me:""Sorry Hammila. I'm gonna grab my dog

I went outside

And to top it off

TL;DR: Dog follows Sunflower home. Hammila uses this as an excuse for me to come over for coffee. Tells me not to run because it makes me look ridiculous
