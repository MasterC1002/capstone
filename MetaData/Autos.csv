So auto guys

I am linking this post within our current discussion as well so hopefully we can have an interesting conversation on the different perspectives on the issue.

**EDIT:** Since this is getting bigger than I thought let me provide some background info for new readers. Lane filtering is the ability of a motorcycle to move between cars at a stop light to the front. Lane splitting is moving between cars within moving or potentially moving traffic such as rush hour and traffic jams. I am not referring to the idiots you see weaving through traffic at 100mph

1370484449.0,1fri7h,A stranger let me drive his Model S,garytherival,307,52,51,"I left the library late last night

I ended up in a nice residential area tucked along the river. The streets are narrow and poorly-lit so I was taking it easy and just enjoying the scenery.

As I turned around a bend, I saw the door open and the taillights of an A6 flashed back at me.

Intrigued, the lights of the car above the A6 turned on and I couldn't tell what model it was, which is very unusual for me.

As they began to back the car out onto the ramp

I backed up and parked in the street. As I walked back to the truck

""Yeah

I asked Ravi for the story behind the car. He simply replies ""I ordered it about 18 months ago and I've been waiting for this night for a long time."" I didn't expect this guy

He was pretty cool. I told him that I had to hang around to get some pictures of the Tesla. He said he could tell I was an enthusiast by my car (G37 coupe) and invited me to park in his driveway.

I walked down from the house and there it was. The presence of the Model S is stunning. It was painted metallic brown, I got my time with the car, inspecting all the shapes and details. As Ravi and his friend returned, I was ready to thank him and be on my way.

""Hop in! We're gonna see what this thing can do.""

Now, awestruck.

Ravi wasted no time. He put it in drive and nailed it, or the 25 MPH speed limit in this quiet neighborhood. All I can do is echo what the journalists all say - the sensation was unreal. Swift, forceful, and silent. We had hit 60 before I knew what happened. It crossed my mind that this may not have been the best idea.

We slowed down and got to talking. Ravi told me that he owned some local hotels and I told him I was still a student. We cruised around town for a little while, and trying to figure out the dashboard. (It's very cool but very frustrating to use. It took three young, tech-savvy, car guys far too long to figure out the volume control.)

Ravi took us to the interstate for some on-ramp action. Not only did he floor it

""I don't mean to be a wet blanket

He sensed my tension and reassured me that he does this to his cars all the time. But he said he would take me back to my car before he and his friend took it to some empty roads to open it up. This was fine with me - I didn't want to impose.

He pulled into a gas station after we got off the interstate. ""Your turn

""Wait

""Nah

I got in the driver's seat and brought us back. Again

We arrived back at the house and I thanked the man gratuitously for the drive. ""If you ever get a hankering to drive a 5 year old G37, disturbed by the noise and vibration of it compared to the Tesla. I had this feeling after my first time on a speedbike that driving would never be the same again. It won't.",,False,self,t5_2qhr3,False,,
