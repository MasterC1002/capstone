Link is to a review their algorithm doesn't filter

Dear Kdu

Soak this in for a second

I don't know anything about you

My sister is the owner of Diablo Taco.  As my polar opposite, and owning a restaurant has been her dream since for as long as I can remember.  

Yelp is not what you think it is.  A week after my sister opened Diablo

4-5 star Reviews from well-established food critics are being blocked, are on the front page.  I don't care what you think about me, but are you proud that you're deliberately hurting my sister, someone you've never met?  

What Yelp is doing is no different than mafia protection schemes - it's basic blackmail because they own the market.  In the end my sister will probably have to pay them to get her ratings back up because hipsters like you care more about Yelp than face to face experience.  

Her name is Summer.  She's wonderful

If you think their prices are too high

If you think it's too loud

I used to love Yelp because I believed in its utility

This past month has been a rollercoaster for our family.  The restaurant has been well-received by food critics and seems to be doing well with the local population.  On the other hand

Last week

In any case

Cheers

Clay

Several of my friends and I all bought houses within our little part of West Philadelphia.  One friend suggested that since we all lived near each other

And then one day I came up with an idea for an all voluntary based system.  We gave my idea a try using google spreadsheets and here's how it worked: anytime a host wanted to make a meal, how spicy, and the protein source) and block off the number of seats available for others to use (some houses could hold alot of us, others not so much).  Since you can setup google spreadsheets to notify you by email whenever a certain column or cell changes, that would be the alert mechanism to inform the other households that somebody was making an upcoming dinner.  Anybody in our group could sign up to attend on a first-come first-serve basis.

At the time

By making it all voluntary, and never had to be more involved than they wanted to.  Some participated several times a week, others were involved maybe once every other month.

It worked! And it was more successful than I thought it would be.  We were sharing about 50 meals every 3 months between the 8 households.  Through our little system, and good tex mex all through eating with my friends.  We really saw the value in our little food co-op.

At the time I was manually keeping track of credits on the google spreadsheet.  But I started thinking - what if I made a website that automated every step of the process.  Then this same system could be used by people all over the world.  My way of making the world a cooler place.  I had been looking for a way to improve my PHP/mySQL skills and thought it would be a fun project to tackle.

Well, it's like custom license plates - I'm just proud of my little project).

**TL/DR** I made a website that's free to use and creates a voluntary system to help people coordinate getting together over meals.  It worked great for me and my friends


******

Edit 1: What an amazing day it's been.  So cool to see others check out my hobby for the past many months!  I'll just add one last thing: while it *started* as a way of keeping track of friends eating at friend's houses as described above, it'll keep getting cooler in time.

Edit 2: People have been joining so quickly that I'm on the upper end of my website's mail quota at the moment.  I'm working with my host to get that increased but until then if you have any difficulties please be patient.  Lastly,False,self,t5_2qh55,True,,,t3_ezi6t
