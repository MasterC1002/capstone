This was my opportunity to show my fellow coworkers what Madison is all about.  I want to say thank you.  Everyone was blown away at how clean the city is and at all there is to do.  I was really sad to leave at the end of my time there and can't wait to return again.  I want to share some of the pictures I took.  I only got around campus and the Capitol, and the one man band just reminded me of how much I love this city, because no matter who you are or what you like, there is something for you in this town.

The attack, we are reporting this to the FBI and Wisconsin Attorney General, and taking all the steps we can to ensure this does not happen again.
Clearly this was done to deny the people of Wisconsin access to the recall Walker materials United Wisconsin is trying to provide.
Despite these efforts to again stifle the people's voice
It is our intention to continue as planned to provide you with a link to the recall petitions just after midnight tonight. Please bear with us as we attempt to fix this problem. Some external pages associated with our website are still up and running

Last year we hosted Global Reddit Meetup at Vilas Park and I think most attendees agree that this is an excellent location for this year's event as well.  

We had a pretty impressive spread last year, more board games, more field games, more charismatic pets, more grills, more photos, more redditors

For everyone who expressed interest in the recent I-want-to-make-friends posts

The [Capital Lakes DragonFest](http://www.capitallakesdragonfest.com/) will be going on til about 4pm

[This is one of our group photos from last year](http://i.imgur.com/OmMO0h.jpg).  

[Here is an entire album of the great food

Let's do it again! Success is up to us. Bring a dish to pass around, card games, and whatever fun activities you want to share. Last year we had wiffle ball, a slackline, cards against humanity, touch football, an unexpected magician

[This is a link to Vilas Park information and map](http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1365). There do not seem to be any other events that day.   

In addition to consumables, plastic/paper eating utensils, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. A roll of toilet paper isn't the worst idea either.     

We usually start around 1pm and pack up as the sun goes down. Folks who aren't quite done partying usually head to a bar downtown afterwards.  

This post is to get the ball rolling. Further discussion will follow. Please share your ideas, suggestions for making this better than years in the past, etc. I'd especially like to hear input on what to do if it rains considering we've been very lucky the last few years.

I have always been wary of the police (had 1 or 2 bad experiences with small town cops and county sheriffs when living in Whitewater) But the professionalism and willingness to help that was displayed by Officer Dailey was a very pleasant departure from the usual conduct I have experienced in the past.  This experience, the MPD anyway.

Well then I moved. I called AT&amp;T about the move and they informed me that DSL was not available in the area, but I took them at their word as I have little knowledge of WAN technologies.




First problem: The service took *over a month* to get turned on. I had the modem within 3 days




Second problem: After waiting ages for them to turn on the service, proceeds to replace the modem. We go through *three* of the goddamned things before we get one that works. For the record, the technician was swell and I have no complaints about him.




Third problem: My speed is only 1.5Mb/768k. Ugh. After calling AT&amp;T, it's tolerable and the rate is low. I'll fucking deal.




Fourth problem: First bill is twice what I was quoted. Called, the promotion I was offered was in error, and she would not correct it.




Fifth problem: I **never** receive my modem rebate. Every time I call about a billing issue I mention it




After a few months of this

Her: ""Blah blah blah

Me: ""I'm calling to cancel my service""

Her: ""Excellent""

And we proceed to have a nice chat about how I was fucked over, so I said yes, that was possible. She then credits me for the rebate I never received, informs that they're sorry to lose me as a customer, and that's that.



About two months later



**Sixth problem:** I haven't even had a chance to cash said check yet and today I receive a bill for nearly $50 from Assholes




Since I can't reach them after working hours I'll have to call tomorrow during work to see if I can get them to correct this

This past spring I won the Click and Bid auction on Madison.com for a $4

The owner himself

He sent me a quote that had prices near $6

My wife and I, the electrical and plumbing work, and the ductwork to the upstairs for a total of about $1200 (also quoted by him). 

He then changed his tune and told me that, in addition to a new furnace I would now needs a new power-vented water heater. The furnace he insisted on replacing was vented to the roof along with the water heater which is OK as far as code goes. In fact, All Comfort Services were the ones who put it in to begin with so now he was kind of contradicting himself - did they install the furnace against code 8 years prior or is it up to code and now he needs to make up for the difference he is losing in the auction? Also, no code violations were found during the initial home inspection and the homeowner's insurance inspection.

What I ended up doing is hiring a home inspector (different from the one used when I purchased the house to prevent charges of impropriety) to look everything over again. He came

This was what I had at the time so the wife and I decided we didn't really want any more services from All Comfort Services

So I wrote Kendall an email about a refund and he agreed initially. After a week or so of no communications from him despite several calls and emails I eventually had to file a dispute with my credit card company to get my initial money back from the auction. 

Sorry this is so long but I just wanted to share my story so that perhaps I can prevent you from wasting a bunch of time

**Potluck Frisbee Alcohol Consumption Extravaganza** 

**Saturday

**Pending Start Time: 4:00 p.m.**

I left the voting thread open for a few weeks so anyone who had an opinion could hop on and I got two main ideas:

Vilas Park

Union Terrace

I am going to just call it as Vilas even though it was pretty much deadlocked by what I read. Sorry if I'm pissing off approximately half of you. 

Reasons:

- Easier to find a spot for a (hopefully) large group

- Rumor has it booze is okay so long as it's not in glass.

- More underage friendly

We will not be reserving a shelter. That just seems like a mess waiting to happen. I know I can't front the reservation costs and I wouldn't ask anyone else to put their money and name on the line for a bunch of internet strangers. Even if we are some pretty awesome strangers. 

I was thinking a potluck deal might work out well. I am not sure on the grilling aspect of it though

If anyone has a couple foldout tables I think that would help with setup too. 

It was mentioned in the last thread that a tent structure of 10 x 10 or bigger requires a permit

I hope we don't run into hassles for being a ""party"" because really it's just a large gathering. We can all pretend to not know each other if we are accused of such things. Which shouldn't be hard considering most of us don't know each other. 

If there is bad weather there is a backup plan: meeting up at the terrace! Or another bar or building

Sorry if I'm missing anything. If there is important stuff I'm overlooking then yell at me angrily and I'll update it!

I hope to see a lot of you there! Holy shit there are almost 1000 of us now.",,t5_2r8rz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/hllvm/final_meetup_post_probably/

Edit 2: A few people seem to be in a hissy about me giving ""bad advice"" due to a misinterpretation of my title or my post

1) I am not telling motorists to run over pedestrians.  Obviously.

2) Motorists are *not* legally required to stop for pedestrians or bicyclists who are waiting to cross (in a position where they will not be run over
http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/IV/24
which I believe is the same law FatBikeFanatic keeps beating me over the head about, motorists must only yield right of way to pedestrians/bicyclists who have begun to cross, or who have been given the signal to cross in the case of streetlights.  This is a controlled intersection, because it has stop signs for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Therefore, motorists do not need to yield right of way, and should not be expected to, so pedestrians and bicyclists should cross at their own risk when a car in one lane has stopped for them.  I personally will continue not to!

Today, W Washington is a four-lane street, so there are two lanes of oncoming traffic, and a car in the other lane did not stop for the pedestrian because they could not see him, because their vision was obstructed by the stopped car (on the train tracks!).  Now, you might argue that the oncoming car should have stopped once they saw that the car in the other lane was stopped, but the thing is cars are not supposed to stop there anyway!

There may be a bit of confusion because there are lines painted in the road to indicate where cars are supposed to stop, I see cars stop for pedestrians and bicyclists (myself included) all the time, going both directions, and every time I get (possibly irrationally) upset because of how stupid and unsafe it is.  It's unsafe for pedestrians, because cars are not supposed to stop for them, and one car stopping in one lane might encourage a pedestrian to cross even though cars in the other lane either don't know to stop for the crossing pedestrian because they CANNOT SEE THEM. It's unsafe for motorists, at least westward

Usually what ends up happening is a car stops, pedestrians are slow.  Or, a single car stops for me to cross even though there are no other cars in sight and if he had just kept on going I would have been able to cross just as easily without delaying the car, except I refuse to cross in that situation because I don't actually have the right of way and I'm more afraid of getting run over by someone than I am of having to wait an extra few minutes, so we end up staring at each other until the person in the car decides to finally stop being an idiot and go and by that time traffic has finally caught up so I need to wait for them to pass and hope none of them try to be ""kind"" and stop to let me cross.

I'm sorry for this long rambling post, they should know not to give way when they do not have a stop or yield sign (they certainly don't do it for other cars at normal intersections!), and they should know not to stop ON THE TRAIN TRACKS.  I know that other intersections on and around campus have signs that say motorists should yield to crossing pedestrians, particularly on Langdon near Memorial Union, but W Washington has no such sign and is such a busy street that yielding for pedestrians is just not tenable.",,False,t5_2r8rz,True

I usually go for a jog around Hoyt Park everyday. Today I got delayed so I wasn't able to go out until 8:45 pm for my jog. When I stepped out of my house a white kid probably 16 and an Asian kid probably also 16


Then all of a sudden two older guys (probably both 18) come running down the street on the opposite side of me. They see me and cross and take off at a full sprint toward me. I slow down to a jog and just stare at these two guys thinking what the fuck do they want I literally have nothing on me

I decide to keep going and 2 minutes later a car speeds passed me and some guy yells at me 'HEY I GOT YOU' and then speeds off. 

At this point it's completely dark outside and I just decide to head home. As I'm going home 3-4 teens on bikes start riding near me, so I take off sprinting. I manage to lose the kids on the bikes and get in my house and post on Reddit.

The service base license is required because you need to have a commercial kitchen wherein you prepare your food and ingredients for the day. Food carts aren't allowed to actually cook food in their carts but just reheat and assemble ingredients that they've prepared earlier at a professional kitchen that has passed health board certification. Food made from home kitchens is prohibited.

So my question is for those who don't already use food carts as an extension of their restaurant (negating the need for a service base). What places in Madison allow you to cook and prepare food for the day? Is there something like a community kitchen? Or do you have to rely on someone you know who has a restaurant and will let you use their facilities?

We should have a meetup!

I was thinking about a weekend in December

A Saturday in December anybody? Downtown would probably be best for everyone because of it's central location. Any ideas for bars or restaurants? 

EDIT: Alright

I live on the far east side but I am completely down for going out there for the meetup

I think that the two best dates from what I read over would be Dec 4th or Dec 11th

Edit 2: Maybe if everyone just sends me their votes for the day time in a PM i can gather the data and post? Unless someone has a better idea... a comment in this thread maybe?

EDIT THREE: So everybody has been throwing in their two cents and here's what it seems is best- 
Saturday
The Great Dane Hilldale   5 pm

I will try and get there earlier and maybe reserve an area for redditors/ make a sign so we can find each other. If anyone else who is closer to that area could maybe help that would be cool. I've actually never been to that Great Dane.

The bus line shoots straight to Hilldale mall from downtown

Although I've never been here

I am going to post a new thread for this now that it's all figured out. 

Thanks everyone",,t5_2r8rz,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/e88ok/madison_meetup/

He is a Shiba Inu

If you catch him or see him

And if anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to better find him

**UPDATE: ice_floe and another very nice caller point me to my (probable) dog getting caught and staying at the Dane County Humane Society.**

THANKS so much for pointing me to this. I spent the last couple hours posting up flyers.

I had also gotten a call from a very nice woman who works at a shelter who confirmed to me the stats of this dog and it matches very very well with my dog (along with where he has been sighted and where he was caught).

I've left a message with the Humane Society and will hopefully talk to them tmrw to confirm that this be here my dog. 

All signs point to yes. Thanks so much. I just moved here to Madison and I gotta say in general and specifically the people here are just nicer and more helpful. My kind of city! &lt;3 Will update on if this really is my dog or not. Hopes up? yes! If he isn't

Now that we have the date and time all set and everybody is sufficiently excited

* Charcoal and gas grills are fine- which means I am recruiting people who have them to bring them

* Music- Wiguy posted a link to amplification permits. It said nothing against boom boxes/ portable players. I'm assuming theyre okay so long as they are not classified as a stereo system, etc. I also think that guitars or other instruments would be fine and encouraged.

* There can be NO alchohol in GLASS. All other types are fine. Mini kegs, whatever so long as it's not glass and we clean up after ourselves. 

* I would like to do something cool as a group to commemorate the event. If there is a good photographer out there we should get a group photo. Although everyone is free to have whoever with them

To finish this off

If you aren't on here or are on here and want me to change something just leave a message or shoot me a pm and I will update. I guess we can kind of use this as our headcount estimation. The more accurate the better guys. 

I didn't list anyone saying they'd bring alcohol because this is how it's gonna roll: bring enough for yourself to drink for sure

In no way do I promise that this will be the last update.

Apartment flooded and MPM is screwing us on living costs.,Jakor,28,3,28,"So earlier in the week when I returned home from work I discovered my apartment had been completely flooded while I was gone due to a sprinkler from the room above us being broken. This caused water to spray from every electrical socket, MPM told us that we need to move out into a hotel for a week or so
   Well, we were already informed that our apartment received the worst damage, and therefore would take the longest to dry out and repair. The check turned out to be less than even half of the cost to rent a hotel room for the ten days they quoted us, while other apartments had far less damage and could return sooner, pocketing several hundred dollars from their short hotel stay. How can this be right? We are all full time college students without the time or money to deal with any of this right now, and they could have made the process easy, but they had to pull the rug out from under us right after they sent us out to drop some serious money on a hotel room. We are going to talk to them today to see if we can't work something out

It's more or less a straight shot

Obvious the bars are packed closer together the closer you get to State but for those who have time and a sense of adventure we could do most of that route.

I'm still crutching it at the moment but hopefully by the time we get something going I'll be mostly mobile.

So who wants in and what are your preferences? I'm up for most anything except sports bars.

EDIT: So no one is really expressing any preferences to where or when. Come on people

EDIT2: I'm starting to get a feel that a Saturday one or two weeks out from today is good? Is this correct. Also that we should start on Willy since the distance between bars is longer on Willy? Is this correct? I'm thinking start at Crystal Corner, hit Wisco, from there's it's a slug to Essen/Northwoods/Come Back In(same building), then there's Cardinal which we can stop at or skip depending on what event is going on. After that we can go up King St, hit anything we like such as Great Dane, then go down Main St. past the Capital to Genna's, possibly Shamrock Club and then Dise. From there it's over to State St and whatever our drunken selves can manage at that point! LOL

EDIT3: For those among us hesitant to stop at a ""gay bar' such as PlanB or Shamrock I would like to remind you lots of (Bi-)women like to hit PlanB but not Shamrock so much. ;) 

PlanB is huge and usually has good DJ's like LizzyT and they play good 'accidentally' rub yourself up against someone music

Finally

* Are there any important events being celebrated that day? Anyone have a birthday? I know of one fantastic reddit couple celebrating their first wedding anniversary.  
* What the shit do we do if it rains?  
* Global reddit meetup veterans
* It's always appreciated when people rsvp and mention what they're bringing so we can take inventory and figure out what we'll need in the final days.     
* I notice other cities are advertising their global meetups with a banner on the top of the subreddit. How do we make that happen?

The chaotic scene was unfolding on an otherwise beautiful Monday

Many others were on the Monona Terrace rooftop, that came running. No, it was a Good Samaritan named James, who happens to be homeless.

He saw the woman on the rail, desperately hanging on; hanging on with all the strength she could muster. James, age 46, could hear screaming: ""Let me go! Let me go!""

He ran to both and helped grab onto the first, with the help of arriving officers, she was placed on a chair. A witness, who called 911, said it was clear the duo had saved a life.

One of two MPD officers, James, and the city employee worked to comfort and contain the distraught woman, holding and hugging her, keeping her seated. She was still trying to break free, still wanting to jump.

A MPD lieutenant brought a wheelchair to the roof

The officer, and thank the city employee too.

At the same moment, that the woman had come to her Community Development Authority office. The visitor was upset about her family possibly being evicted. The concerned employee sensed something was very wrong. The woman kept saying, ""I'll leave, I'll just go away."" The city worker followed her out of the Madison Municipal building, and trailed behind as the woman walked up a Monona Terrace rooftop ramp. The city employee had a gut feeling things were about to get much worse, and she was right. The woman moved to a rail, clutched it with her hands, and was about to jump. That was when the employee decided to act fast. She knew she could not bring the woman back from the brink by herself. She just hoped - as she yelled for help and bear hugged the woman from behind - that someone would hear her pleas. A homeless man named James did.

Luckily, it's probably going to be another long while until the three of us see each other in person again. I'd really like to make this happen while we have this chance. Life is short, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity while I have it.

This is where I could use a little help. I'd like to match the clothing as closely as possible. Unfortunately, gray, and black t-shirts in two-packs and wear them until they literally fall apart... my winter tops are all either gifts or were bought at concert or festival merch booths, lol). The awesomest thing would be if anybody has any shirts similar to these that I could borrow or buy. If not that, any tips as to where to hunt for such fine apparel would be seriously appreciated. FWIW, for my brother on the left, I figure I'll just iron on those numbers once I find a top close enough in other aspects. Also

Any help with this is seriously, and it would be one of the most meaningful things I've done in a long time. Help me, ~~Obi-Wan Kenobi~~ r/madisonwi. You're my only hope.

Edit: **TL;DR:** Recreating [old photo of my brothers and me](http://i.imgur.com/PUONo.jpg) for parents. Need halp finding/making similar-looking clothes please.

Here is the deal now:

The last time I put one of these ones together I was all ""meh it's only gonna be a few people we can just meet somewhere"". Well, no large seating area so we were scattered. It was still insanely fun, with drunken contact being one of my new favorite passtimes (wow that sounds creepy out of context.... contact is a game, I was drunk for the record). 

SO

Are we doing a park event cookout? If so, what about bad weather? should we take shelter into account? 

Should we just reserve out a location indoors like a restaurant? 

It would be nice to have a somewhat accurate headcount

Just to be clear: it will for sure be Saturday June 25th- international meetup day. 

If anyone wants to help set this up that would be great. I am currently computerless so my redditing is done by phone and library so that's a bit of a hindrance.

- The sub is now over 400 redditors deep

- The increasing number comes with a tiny bad side: Apparently the spam filter is accusing you guys of being scammers for no reason. That pretty much never happened when we were little


So


- Last note: MEETUPS. We have been having a lot of meetups now and they are pretty damn fun. So here is my proposal:

If a meetup is scheduled and everybody comes up with an agreement of time/ place/ date then just let me or a_redditor know and we can throw it up in the sidebar. This way we can have an easy go-to list on the side so everyone can see.

Though I haven't had to deal with their bullshit I've had so many friends who have suffered under MPM's neglect or incompetency. Every single thing I've heard about this company has been negative. Recently had some friends who got fucked over because of some ""mix up"" with rent checks.

Here's the worst story though:
A lady friend of mine used to live at a MPM property, she calls and calls MPM, leaves messages and no one gets back to her. Finally on a tuesday a different guy shows up as she's leaving for work, says he needs to get into her closet to access the pipes. As this is where some sort of access panel is located she thinks nothing of it. She returns that night to find the problem is almost a bad as it was to begin with, the mess isn't as bad despite the fact that theres a bunch of drywall dust all over the bottom of her closet and shoes. Then she sees it...her sock/panty drawer (located in storage drawers in the closet) is open a bit and several pairs are missing. A jar hidden  under her bed was missing an 1/8 of dank and a 1/4 of mushrooms. And the worst...some of her dirty underwear are gone. She calls up MPM to complain that the plumbing issue still isnt fixed all the way and tell them about the theft of the clothes (leaving out the theft of the drugs of course). The person answering the phone takes a message says a rep will get back to her asap. Repeat 3 more times over the span of a week. Finally she threatens to call the cops. (I know, I know she should have then)

 Someone calls her back and says they will contact the plumbers and investigate and that they will send someone new to fix the problem properly. 2 weeks pass and nothing. Fed up and extremely shy by nature, she just rode out the rest of it out. 2 months later and she was out of there.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,1340512050.0,,

**Trent**:  A guy came yesterday and was able to fix the problem

**Trent**:  For fixing something that clearly wasn't our fault.

**Kayla M**:  Anytime a technician comes out and you do not have our wire maintenance fee on the account there is a fee just so you know for future visits. Our wire maintenance plan is $4.99 a month.

**Trent**:  ...that seems kind of ridiculous. To charge us for fixing a service that you're supposed to be providing.

**Trent**:  I realize you don't make the policies

**Kayla M**:  I do apologize for any inconvenience.

**Kayla M**:  Unfortunately

**Trent**:  Also

**Trent**:  I assumed a routine service visit to fix things would not be something I would be charged for

**Kayla M**:  Allow me to apologize for any miscommunication.

**Kayla M**:  Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Trent**:  I guess not. There's no possible way I can lodge a formal complaint or anything like that?

**Kayla M**:  On charter.com/contact us

**Trent**:  Where should I go from there?

**Kayla M**:  Once you have clicked on contact us you can click on corporate information.

**Kayla M**:  Was there anything else I can do for you today?

**Trent**:  It just lists the general Charter phone # under ""Customer Inquiries""

**Kayla M**:  Then you can send a letter to 12405 Powerscourt Drive

**Kayla M**:  I would like to thank you for being a loyal customer and choosing Charter and you have a great rest of the day

Thank you for visiting. Please contact us again at any time.

Hi, is going on tour this November and we need some local help.

We're a psych-pop/indie rock band from Brooklyn, and also supporting a new record.

There is one date left to fill while we're on the road: Tuesday 11/13.  We are hoping to come to Madison if all works out, we would love to share the stage with one or two local bands. We would obviously be able to return the favor in Brooklyn if any local bands can help us out in your neck of the woods.

**AT&amp;T**

 DSL or UVERSE - prices are OK for internet-only with DSL but not so much for UVERSE, and service is pretty stable, but they supported Walker, they send all internet and phone traffic to the NSA apparently, and they are starting bandwidth caps (150GB - 25GB per month)


**Charter**

internet only packages are OK priced, they actively deny access to sites they don't agree with (P2P), they did not support Walker (probably because they are near bankrupt), and they have bandwidth caps (150GB - 250GB per month)

On the West side, except they too supported Walker.

For me, and run a home web server for photo/video sharing with my family and AT&amp;T DSL has been OK with low prices. Now, with the new data caps, I'm going to get screwed. I'll be paying a ton more to switch to UVERSE (to get the higher caps) and still may go over the data limits. At least going over the monthly caps doesn't auto-terminate the account. They just charge +$10/50GB. But sticking with AT&amp;T means sticking with Walker and wiretapping, which sucks. Switching to Charter means doing a bunch of crap to keep my web server up and risking account termination if I go over the data caps. It is a no-win situation.

* Tree Bar = Paul's Club Bar on state street.
* Bear/Lynx/ Mounds = Effigy Mounds in Elmside Park
* Old Beets = Old Sugar Distillery

While there are as many thoughts about the reasons for success, I believe that having Fighting Bob.com as our progressive voice--with daily blogs and superb articles has given us reach and has allowed us to stop fretting that the corporate media won't cover our events--we provide our own coverage.

We have a great program this year. Ruth Conniff will co-chair this Bob Fest. Barbara Lawton will lead the Destructive Force of Citizens United along with Norman Solomon and Mike McCabe; ""ALEC Exposed"" will be led by Lisa Graves; Terry O'Neil, Jill Stein, will speak. Our La Follette historian Nancy Unger will be here; Mining in Wisconsin will be a fight we must win.

Phil Donahue, John Nichols, Greg Palast, Juan Cole, and Mahlon Mitchell will inspire the audience, Bill McKibben is coming and I can't think of anyone in America better than Bill on climate change. Speaking of change, we will have a breakout on ""The Next Generation.""
