I should probably start off by saying that I am not as much of a ""fanboy"" as some of the people out there, have thought only positive things. 

So yeah, but I will go into why I now hate it.

Last night

So I forced a shut down, but no visual. Tried again. Same result. Spent hours on forums. No solutions. Only advice was ""You better hope that you are still under 'Apple Care' "".

Probably worth pointing out that I am not under Apple Care ($3k machine

So I went ahead, to find the Apple Store. Another thing I would like to point out is there are like 2:1 employee:customer ratio, and no one fucking helped me carry this beast in.

Basically the guy behind the counter did a lot of what I did

 (NB the order in which they would try to fix the problem)

First: They would replace the current display with a new one

what. the fuck.

THEN they would move on to seeing if it is the video card that needs replacing. And due to that piece of shit begin integrated with everything else in the fucking machine (to save space)


So I basically just walked out

If anyone reads this, and if you want, I would be happy to answer some questions, but in this state of mind, will probably just link you to

It would be great if these switches were actual hardware and not dependent on the OS to function. That way it would avoid the problems finding the right keys in windows/linux, a dimmer on the side of the screen for brightness (and an on/off switch!), a volume wheel on the front, a wifi on/off switch (I've seen a few of these but not often on netbooks, my vostro has a wifi finder switch).

2. Programs like ""Fileshredder"" work by 'deleting' the file, I have heard of people deleting something with Fileshredder and then, just to test, successfully retrieving the file using data recovery software. What gives?",,False,,False,t3_ohon5

This company has just recently become large/wealthy. They never really had to deal with large files. It was always 2 Mb files sent over e-mail. Being the IT guy here, I came up with a solution, a brilliant one.



I'll do my best to keep it simple.

Made a pro-100 Dropbox account.

Installed dropbox.

I forced dropbox to accept a shared folder as a working directory. Via pyDropboxPath. (At the company we use a dual-Xeon box with multiple accounts and use VNC to log-in to our respective accounts.)

I made a shortcut on every account's desktop for Dropbox's public folder and showed them how to drag-and-drop and get a share link. My colleagues couldn't believe how easy it was.

But then



I dowloaded AutoHotkey and wrote a 4 line script which triggers when the Clipboard buffer in Windows is accessed at any time. It then looks for ""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/#######"" (dropbox uses a static number for your account) and replaces it with ""http://mywebsite.com/fileserve"". I compiled this script into a replacer.exe file of 200kB and modified the Box's registery policies for all users Windows/Run to include the execution of replacer.exe.


I logged in to our site's FTP and added this to .HTACCESS


""redirect 301 /fileserve http://dl.dropbox.com/u/#######"" effectively


 ####### signifies your unique and static dropbox user number.


Almost 0 bandwidth is used up by your own website. Note that our company does have an unlimited 25D/25U line. So the sync process is seamless.

1) So I've been told that processors became more powerful over time as engineers found ways of making transistors smaller and smaller while at the same time increasing the clock speeds that they could reliably deal with. However I've also been told that one processor can only do one operation at a time. So while I understand why speed can increase the productivity (can do things faster) of a processor I don't understand what more transistors will do (can still only do 1 operation at a time). 

2) What constitutes 1 processor operation? Is it reading 1 bit? 1 byte? 1 memory address? Preforming an operation on a series of bits/bytes? Maybe even more?

Just looking around for different laptops, while the newest X230T can't offer anything better than an ""HD"" 1366x768 12.5"" display. WTF? Why are we going backwards?

Apple seems like the only company with a clue

Clearly we have the technology to make extremely dense displays. Take projectors for example - they can pack 1920x1080 in a tiny LCD to project through. Why are we still stuck with 15"" laptops with 1280x800 as the norm? Does anyone else like pixel density as much as me

NTFS can be read and written to by all three (with NTFS-3G for OS X and Linux).
ext3 cannot be written to by macs (not sure about windows). You can mount ext3 as ext2 but I would like a journaled file system since a journaled file system is less likely to become corrupt after a power failure.

I am wondering how easy it would be for someone like myself to build my own server. I am looking to build a basic file server for people in the house I live in to use as storage space

Basically I want it so they can go right to the network (rather than using the internet) and log on to this server. Then they can FTP or put lolcatz all over the wakaba board to their hearts content. 

I don't want it to connect to the internet and I am hoping to put just enough security on it that it requires a password for users to log on to the server. Or maybe it should connect to the internet? So they can access if from anywhere? 

I am not that technically literate

I can learn quickly if need be. I am just wondering if it is worth trying to undertake this project

2) Has full I/O capability just like a laptop (audio out, ethernet, everything else would be pointless)

3) Looks like a tablet (touchscreen!) with detachable keyboard. Not sure how that would work but my idea would be a case that houses the tablet and has space to fit in a bluetooth keyboard. The case would fold backwards when no keyboard is being used. The case would fold with some resistance so you could orient it like a regular laptop and the screen (tablet) would stay in place.

So android for usual stuff (calender, social media, web browsing, etc) and windows for REAL work.

Computer 1 (Grad student work computer)
I need at least 500GB of storage to back up 3 years of data.  Currently I have two internal drives both 750GB.  One is used strictly to back up the main drive.  I would like more of an automatic back up set up.   Access to individual files from multiple computers is a plus.  That way if I forgot a file at work I have access to it from home.  I normally keep my most current stuff sync with a 300GB 2.5” portable drive for traveling but you know how that one file gets left behind. 


Computer 2 (home laptop and external USB hard drive)
I would like a more of an online storage type account with automatic backup.   I would want access to my files via the web.   The laptop only has a 30GB hard drive and the external drive is 750GB.   Currently I have about 200-300GB of data on the USB drive.
I don’t always have the USB drive plugged in

I’ve looked at Dropbox, Backblaze, and Carbonite.   It seems the external drive is making it difficult.  I’ve also read that if my Laptop drive is only 30GB but I have 200GB of data this might cause issues.  

So I know turn to the hivemind experts.   Anyone else I should be looking at?  Good or bad experience with these companies?

I have all those components for my pc and wish to keep them. I have an Albatron PX865PE pro (http://www.albatron.com.tw/English/product/mb/pro_detail.asp?rlink=Specification&amp;no=52) which this computer was working but is not letting me pass the last known configuration screen.. also the CPU for this motherboard is reading at 61 degrees Celsius

This other motherboard I have is a Asus which i know is a better company but it was handed down to me via a friend because it got ruined some how.  I am not sure whats wrong with it because the power supply wont boot up.  This motherboard is a Asus K8V Se Deluxe...

But anyways what I want to do is keep my AGP graphics card

I just want the best motherboard cpu comobo which has AGP capabilities and will take my ram... and if possible if the mobo has pci express slot for future upgrade if i want to swap the card out or something.  I am not sure if this is all possible but it would be great if someone can find me a solution. 

I also want to find a better sound card that creative labs 5.1 is a pos.

Thanks.

Linux (systemrescueCD) sees, but Gparted reports inconsistencies in the OS partition and will do nothing with it and admonishes me to run DOS Chkdsk /f twice on it before trying again.

I am currently a High School student and while I don't need it right now for school we have had projects that could use it and after school activities (like a Model UN Conference where a laptop would've been helpful). I figure I've been saving up my money pretty nicely and so it's time to purchase a laptop. I have a pretty good desktop computer that I use as my central command so to speak. So gaming wouldn't be necessary on the laptop Here is what I need from it:

HDD: Nothing fancy

Processor: Just good enough to run things. I may run programs that take excess cycles and use it for research or something but even then meh. I'm not gaming so I don't need something amazing

Memory: Probably something pretty decent. I hate slow computers and while I know how to maintain ones sometimes even the best maintaining can't save you... Overkill is not needed, music, etc. (very netbook type activities I guess?)

Optical Drives: CDs are going out of style so not needed

Hubs: USB hubs would of course be important but I don't really need much else.

Battery: I love a longer battery but I make do with the weakening battery of my 2 1/2 year old iPod Touch so maybe just something above average here.

Video Card: Not gaming with this machine. If it can run movies fine then I'm cool.

Screen: I have been spoiled in the past year or so. I have a 1600x900 22"" at home though before that I had a tinier CRT so I don't need something excessive. 11"" is fine.

Operating System: No Apple. Period. Of course if it's Windows 7 then I would want good RAM/memory.

Price: Ah the king here... While I could spend about $1

Was wondering if anyone can help me pick out a decent laptop. Budget is £600 ish.
This is going to be secondary machine for me. I already have a decent gaming desktop setup in another room. 
I'll mainly be using this laptop for a bit of light photoshop use and a bit of web development. 
Id also like to use my laptop for a bit of audio editing and dj'ing. I use programs like Abelton
A big screen would be a bonus as it will allow a better workflow in the programs i use.
Id also like to be able to run windows XP on it as i have quite a lot of old VST plugins that id still like to use with Ableton and soundforge.
I dont really need portability or a lightweight machine as this thing will be living on a table in my frontroom so a desktop replacement would be good.
What i do want though is something rock solid which will last and be stable &amp; reliable.

So here’s the deal.   I’m planning my wife’s 30th  surprise birthday party.  She has family all over the U.S. that she does not get to see them often.
She never sees them.  She’s usually pretty upset about missing family time during the holidays.  
Fast forward to today…Her brother and I are planning a surprise party for her “with a very small twist”.  So here’s the challenge:
**Goal:**  
I would like to have her family across the U.S. see and listen to the “surprise” moment.
**Equipment:**
Laptop with built in web cam
Option of either hard wired or wireless internet connection from the surprise house.
Conference Brige*
**One Small Advantage*:**
Thanks to work
Dilemma:  
How can I have everyone access a site where the VIDEO of the party is being broadcast?  Preferably from the laptop displaying the video.

I had my battery replaced back in August I believe and I think there's a problem with it that I can't seem to figure out. The light that shows when my computer is charging blinks when I have my computer on, and it wasn't showing that the battery was close to being low enough to give a notification. When I turn the computer back on, the battery icon is at 7%, which doesn't make sense. Anywho, noticing this is how I figured something was wrong with the battery, and then I saw that the light blinks. Now every time the laptop dies I have to take the battery out and put it back in (or else it won't even charge or turn on). Then I plug it in, turn it on, the amount it tops off charging the battery to decreases just about every time I turn it on

The time has come to begin considering a new laptop, but the old girl is starting to get tired these days so it's time for a new investment. 

I did a lot of research for a long time to get my thumb on the pulse of the industry at the time of buying my current laptop, what standard of processor I should expect to handle which tasks, what is the benchmark of RAM these days? Do I want a netbook, notebook, or ultrabook?

I JUST DON'T KNOW.

Here's where you

What my new machine must be able to handle:
Word processing, comfortable for typing/mousing (ESSENTIAL), and other general user stuff like films, a small amount of gaming, syncing wirelessly with my smartphone via bluetooth/other, BATTERY LIFE, reputable brand.

Not essential:
Large hardrive, DOES NOT NEED TO HANDLE PC GAMING.

Budget: £500 - £650 / $781 - $1015.

The reason I thought of this is because I'm a DJ who just got a new laptop. Suppose I have a folder of hundreds of gigabytes of music that I want to sync across a desktop and at least one laptop. I want to be able to drop/edit files in there; however



I want to be able to see all the files that exist in my main music library, want to play an older song or mix an unusual mashup. I don't want to fill up my laptop's hard drive with tons of songs that I'll probably never use; however, there's still the chance that there's that [ONE Lamb of God song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdZpxkzNvc) that I just know I could get to work with something [more geared towards a dance floor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6blgjF6UkU), so I need something that can sync individual files selectively. A well-executed ability to upload back would also be helpful, but not necessary in this particular scenario. I also can't stream the file- I need to be able to use it in iTunes, Ableton, and/or whatever DJ software I'm using.



Any ideas if anything like this exists?


**EDIT:** For the specific purpose of music, but I figure iTunes might be a good idea for DJing anyways.

When looking at sites that [estimate the needed power](http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp) for my setup I get an estimate of 319 Watts which is quite low. I currently have a 600 Watt ps and my best friend with nearly identical setup has a 680 Watt supply. Now we both use [Lavalys Everest (renamed AIDA64)]( http://www.lavalys.com/products/everest-pc-diagnostics/) to monitor system statistics. 

Lately my friends system has been cutting off during gaming and I suspected it was due to temperature as he has his rig in a work style desk that has limited circulation but upon inspecting and comparing our system logs found that we have very similar operating temperatures. What I did find however is that his voltages were recorded as varying a bit (talking ~.05V or less) where as mine stay steady at their values. I also noticed that a few of my values were not exactly where they should be (3.3 = 3.81V 

So I was pretty much wondering if anyone with an “overkill high quality” could possibly send me/post their performance logs so I could compare with the hopes of being able to confirm or rule out the power supply being the issue? Would also be interested in any constructive comments.

クエリは、常に最小のインデックスに移動し、それが有効なバージョンを見つけるまで、チェーンを移動します

検証のハッシュを提供するだけでなく、少しのステータスを提供するアップデートに加えて：
0 - グループがアクティブである
1 - グループが無効になっています

問題が発見された場合は通常のリリースでは、常に0に等しい指標であると更新は、彼のマーカーをオフにする必要があり
ので、今のホールの問合せチェーンは、私は障害者のグループをスキップしますとき1にセットされます。ブロックする必要がありますこのように悪いが更新されます。

障害者のグループは、例えば、保守操作中に削除されます

メンテナンスの前に：
0 - グッド更新C
1 - 更新Bを無効
2 - グッド更新

メンテナンス後：
0 - グッド更新C
1 - グッド更新 ""


スペースがなくなるような出血が発生します。 e.g：

0から1000000までの更新
1 - アップグレード999999
2 - アップグレード999998
...
999999 - 元のベースのインストール

空き容量：0

その後、更新がこの更新プログラムをインストールするには出番、最高インデックス（および古い）は、例えば、999999は、ムッとされます。

0から1000001までの更新
1 - 更新100万
2 - アップグレード999999
...
999999 - アップデート1（元のベースをインストールした後の最初のアップデート）

これは、システムができるだけ多くのアップデートを保存することができます

クエリはカスケード接続可能であり、スコアの更新は（通常）増分であるため、アップデートを格納するためのシステムのための理由があります。例えば
我々は、システムのアップデートの3セットが装備されていることを言う：

0 - アップデート2
1 - アップデート1
2 - 元のベースのインストール

元のベースは、10項目が含まれ、更新が1と1の変更を追加し、1 2変形例1を更新し、追加します。
ときにそのようながない対応を持っていない場合は、1つ、最終的に2かどうかを確認し、最初の場所で更新2かどうかを確認するために実行される入力クエリ。
これは、更新の基本的なインストールを確認することにより、彼はそれをチェーンの最後に最新のアップデートを見つけることができ

試合はその後アップデートのどのグループにも見つからない場合はマッチを移動した（スコアの検索を例えば+ /求められている - 1または何が最初に来る
グループはアップデート+と-1の両方に一致した場合、返された結果）がランダムである

そのスペースが最後にデータベースの一部が失われることを意味し使い果たされた後に更新がチェックアウトされているので。
このプロセスはとても時間がかかるので、瞬間から失われたコアのインストールでは、十分な増分更新されています。
実際のデータの損失はほとんど最小限になりますが、これはまだ問題があることを確認します。

ソリューションは、ストレージを増やすことです。アイデアは、それがメモリ空間が不足するので、時間がかかるので、徐々に限界まで増加させるべきであるということです
到達することはありません。それは、それが何らかの理由で達成されている場合、あなたには、いくつかの答えを失うことになりました。これは別の半マッチはより頻繁に発生する可能性が発生したとき。

失われたデータは、種子の2バッチの融合から派生させることができます。

一度スペースが不足している更新に追加された逆の順序で、チェーンの最後に再追加することができます。
新しいスペースを追加するには、障害が徐々に老衰と可能なディストリビューションセンターになりますが、これは数千年かかることがあります。

更新構造は次のとおりです。

（インデックス） - （ハッシュアップデート） - （ハッシュグループの範囲）/（スコアファイル）
