This guide is meant to help individuals who have purchased Insanity and have yet to begin the first day of hitting play and going the extra mile (or two). This guide is also a consensus of what you can expect your first week in the program.

First off

Secondly, as the name implies, insane and will test your limits physically and mentally. However, as you progress through the weeks, you will find that your limits will increase and you will be able to push yourself further and further (and look better in the process).

For those of you who are still not sure about starting the program or if you need some motivation to start day #1

1)	Take a deep breath and relax. This is not an easy workout or an easy decision to make.

2)	Consult your doctor/physician before starting this workout program. Most of the workouts require fast-paced movements and physical agility to complete (i.e. jumping, etc.), and your doctor/physician will be able to best gauge whether you should enter into this program.

3)	Talk or consult with some other people and Redditors who are in the middle of the program. We’ll be more than happy to answer any questions you may have (to the best of our ability

Before getting into the first day

* **Find a safe surface to perform the workouts on.** I do the workouts in my carpeted living room, helps a little when landing each of my jumps. Your situation may vary (hardwood floors, gymnasium, etc.), but always make sure it is a solid surface that does not move from your impacts to help prevent injury.

* **Form over speed!** You will be tempted to “break form” to get those last few reps in or to make the exercise easier

* **Make sure to land softly on jumps, especially in the warm-ups. It is important to not only maintain form, but to land softly to keep the floor impact minimal on your knees and legs. This may also minimize noise if you are doing this above the first floor in a multi-story apartment complex. 

* **Rest when you need to!** You will find all of the people working out in the background are physical trainers or instructors of some kind and you will not be able to keep up with them the entire time

* **Drink lots of water!** We’re not talking about before, in combination with a recovery/protein shake and a sound nutrition plan, will help minimize soreness overall. Plus, it can be cost-effective in the long-term versus soda or other unhealthy beverages.

* **Breathe and keep your core tight!** Most of the exercises will focus on your legs and core (hip flexors

* **Do the warm-ups and stretches EVERY time!** You may be tempted to skip the warm-ups or the stretches before and after the workouts

* **Utilize your rest day!** Your body needs time to rest and recover from the workouts, light weights, etc.) so you can still slightly recover and give it your all the next day.

* **Drink the recovery formula (recommended).** While this is not a bare necessity to this workout

* **Take a photo of yourself before starting the program and every few weeks after starting** (recommended by **Micosilver**).This, if you send in your ""before"" picture and your final ""after"" picture, the Beachbody team will send you a [free Insanity shirt!](http://www.beachbody.com/images/beachbody/en_us/pdf/products/programs/insanity/InsanityT-ShirtApplication.pdf) (links to the PDF form with the details; need a PDF viewer to view)

* **Find a workout buddy to do Insanity with you (recommended).** While you can do this program by yourself

With all of that out of the way, will gauge your overall level of fitness and improvement. The FT will start with a warm-up and a stretch before going into the individual exercises, which Shaun T will demonstrate before you attempt them yourself. You will have one minute (60 seconds) on each exercise to complete as many of them as you can, followed by a brief rest period. During each rest period, you will get an opportunity to write down your results. We recommend writing down your results on the same sheet of paper each FT so you can compare your prior results and see how much you have improved throughout the program. If you cannot complete the first FT, then write down what you did and try the FT again after completing the first two weeks of the program. You will more than likely complete the full FT this time around and beat your other established results in the process!

Typically after the first and second days, but your body will feel better after the first full week (rest day included).

I hope this guide helps in giving you a realistic and positive mindset going into your first week! Please make sure to share your experiences with us and

First, I think!  Like I said in the subject, I've lost 4"" off my waist, 4"" off my hips, and 2.25"" off my chest.  

Also, so I started measuring at the second fit test.  Between the 2nd and last, I only lost 7 pounds, but since I lost so many inches, I guess it's okay!



So

Switch Kicks:   38 --&gt; 51 --&gt; 68 --&gt; 63 --&gt; 78

Power Jacks:	32 --&gt; 35 --&gt; 41 --&gt; 45 --&gt; 48

Power Knees:	36 --&gt; 62 --&gt; 73 --&gt; 86 --&gt; 90

Power Jumps:	16 --&gt; 21 --&gt; 28 --&gt; 34 --&gt; 51

Globe Jumps:	5 --&gt; 8 --&gt; 9 --&gt; 10 --&gt; 10

Suicide Jumps:	1 --&gt; 7 --&gt; 10 --&gt; 11	 --&gt; 13

Push-Up Jacks:	1 --&gt; 1 --&gt; 1 --&gt; 5 --&gt; 13

Low Plank Oblique:	6 --&gt; 32 --&gt; 37 --&gt; 46 --&gt; 50

I'm really happy with the progress I've made in the exercises!  I was hoping to lose more inches

So for everyone just starting - IDK how inspirational my pics are, LOL, but got much better by the end!  So, you can do it!!

Up next for me is a Chalean Extreme/Insanity hybrid in a couple weeks...wish me luck!  

Anyway, but I'm going in the right direction, so I'm happy. Keep it up everybody!  If I can do it, you can do it! :)",,False,self,1368444498.0,t3_1cuz8w

**Nutrition:** I was constantly craving carbs! I fought those cravings using oatmeal, no meat! I ate 5 times a day with the largest meal being breakfast, this was key. If I missed a meal I often felt weak and if I ate a large lunch I would feel heavy and nauseous during my workout even if it was 4 - 5 hours later...

**Supplements:** Whey protein powder

I've been in and out of shape for about 2 years and a huge mountain biker so I wasnt completely out of shape...just shapes :)

I was sitting on the couch one Friday night around 2am completely wasted with my girlfriend and the infomercial for the Insanity program came on; I remember very vividly turning to her and saying ""I just want the damn t-shirt..."" I didn't know that by making that decision I was going to become borderline obsessed with fitness.

I kept it simple at first. I did 2 rounds of Insanity and saw awesome results by just simply losing the fat and eating healthy. I then did the Insanity Asylum series to start building up some of the muscle I lost or never had and then when I decided to bulk up I did Beachbody's Body Beast program - some might laugh

I was at 192lbs when I decided I needed to make a change and got down to 158. My current weight today is 173 and I feel fantastic! I can post before and afters for each program I completed when I get home.

EDIT:
Supplements i took: * Syntha-6 protein post workout and sometimes breakfast. Chocolate Peanut Butter is like tasting Christmas * Animal Pak daily * Inner Armour Casein before bed * C4 preworkout (didn't take this during cardio) * Fish oil

Diet: A lot of veggies (mixed bags and canned) and bananas, light and protein rich. snacks usually consist of nuts or plain greek no fat yogurt with some honey and nuts. i substituted milk for Almond or Coconut milk and stocked up on cartons of egg whites (All Whites)

ive recently started getting some Met-RX big 100 bars and shave off the icing to get rid of the sugar...its a good mid day snack

I'm really happy that I finished it! I almost quit after the first week but I pushed through. I'm planning to do another round after giving my self a week or two to recover before moving on to Asylum.

After countless hours of Shaun T screaming at you and Tanya's wooooing duck face

Now trust me

I am, currently pounding away at Insanity! Round Two.  

So unless you want to be ski-abbing through an extra 10 pounds *on top* of a pile-driving hangover come the new year

**Beer**

Put away your doppelbocks and milk stouts for the season

The gold standard here is Miller 64 or Bud Select 55.  No reason to waver.  Both are terribly named and will prompt double takes when ordered at a bar.  Who cares?  They taste close enough to a normal light beer, your pretend-beer-snob buddies are going to trash you unmercifully.  But they'll be doing it while their dates eye-bang you from across the room.  

If you're at a bar and you are uncomfortable publicly drinking a low-cal beer, don't be a jackass if someone wants one, and nobody will know the difference.  Office parties are harder, especially if they are not held at a bar.  Your best bet in terms of what will most likely be served is Amstel Light (95 cals), Miller Lite (96 cals), or Coors Light (102 cals per bottle).

For further reference on beer calories check out: http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=lowest_cal

**Wine**

Because of the numerous varietals and the myriad makers, the fewer the calories.  The accepted thinking is that on average, a 4oz glass of red has about 95 calories and a 4oz glass of white has about 90.  

That's fine, So Light, Brightlight).  They clock in around 70 calories (more for the Housewife's brand).  They are relatively hard to find.  And they are garbage.  That is, don't show up to a party flashing low-cal wine as your contribution.  Bring a nice bottle of red for everybody and if you must, stash the low-cal bottle inconspicuously somewhere in the house (upstairs bathroom under the sink generally works).  Sneak away and refill accordingly.  

If you are hosting, fill your own glass from the bottle.  But keep an eye on it!  The last thing you want is one of your friends or some dude you are trying to hook up with refilling his glass from the garbage bottle.  Even a Two-Buck-Chucker will know the difference.

**Cocktails**

When it's all said and done and the place is drank dry, Cuervo, Kettle, and Jack all come in around 40% ABV and 100 calories a shot (1.5oz).  Any of their equivalents generally do too.  It's not mixing it with nonsense that will save you the extra power jacks.  

If you must mix, just modify it to cut out the excess calories.  If you drink brown:  Jack and soda, buncha limes.  Order it just like that.  If you drink clear:  Kettle, soda, splash of cran, with a lime.  Boom, now you're properly lubricated to charmingly deflect the jailbait intern's compliments on your shoulders.

As with wine, the Housewife's).  Let's be real honest here.  Ladies, stocking Skinnygirl in your home bar is probably acceptable.  Gentlemen, get real.  Save face, grab an empty Absolut bottle and pull the switch.  Also, if you plan on making cocktails with low-cal booze at someone else's holiday house party, you're flasking it.  And be discreet

For further booze calorie reference

Now then, and you look great... 

The stockings are hung by the chimney with care.  B-Boy Jeff has almost kicked Arielle in the face.  And somewhere Akil is probably giving up on power jumps.   

It's time to get hammered and make some questionable choices.

Please don't hesitate to post content on the site. There are no ""stupid questions"". Let's keep this subreddit active.

I updated the flair today! Go to the right sidebar under ""insanityworkout"" and go to ""Show my flair on this subreddit"". Make sure thats checked

I've separated it out into four different sets of flair basically. ""Interested in Insanity"" if you're thinking about or planning on doing the workout soon. ""Veteran"" if you've completed the 60 day challenge. ""Certified Insane"" if you've done the 60 day routine two times or more. And also, along with the calendar you can update your flair as you progress through the workout. The idea is that people can motivate you and congratulate you as you progress through the 60 days. Every 10 days the color switches.

Previous to Insanity I hadn't worked out for about a year. I used to do some light running until I experienced some knee/back pain. I'm getting married this summer which was my real motivation to lose my belly. Throughout the two months I still ate out, thighs etc before starting out.

Next stage is to repeat the second month of Insanity but a little less intense. I've re-arranged the workouts slightly to give 2 rest days per week. I will check in again in a month or so with some updated pics.

No real warm-up/stretch/cool-down on both sides of the workout proper like you're used to with Insanity.  Each exercise does go through ""progressions"" though so they start out easier and get progressively harder.  I did have to take two mini-breaks just to get a breath.  The movements are similar to things you will have seen in Insanity and Asylum.  Interestingly, but just thought I'd throw it in for anyone curious.  I can post about the other workouts if anyone is interested or on the fence about trying this one out.  Keep pushing play everybody!

1369016692.0,1eo4i7,Finished Insanity today! My results.,Mac_Attack,29,2,14,"Hi everyone. Today I completed my last fit test of Insanity(March 18th to May 19th). I feel absolutely great and proud of myself. 

Some background: Prior to starting Insanity, dropped to 172, and then remained at 182 for most of the time. After about a year and a half of doing this, my wrist started hurting more and more each stay. Finally, the pain was too much and I could not lift anymore. I started to just go to the gym and do cardio, but I figured that it is not enough. I don't remember how, but then I found Insanity. 

Shaun is an amazing motivator. I have never done P90X or any other workout that's on DVD. I read how hard Insanity was prior to starting it, but I was wrong. I couldn't even finish the fit test, and I actually threw my results away because I couldn't even finish half the video. I was so upset and frustrated! Seriously, how the hell could I not even finish the video after hitting the gym for a good amount of time? Next day, I did the next video and decided that I needed to continue if I ever wanted to achieve my dream body. 

After two weeks of sticking with it, hot ones too! My confidence soared and so did my inner game. Long story short, I love how far I have come and how much I have improved. My eating habits are great now. I just feel totally awesome (like Barney Stinson) and I feel like the world is my oyster (so cliché right? lol). 

Since then, and even my girlfriends dad and brother to start Insanity. Only good things have come from doing this and I encourage all of you who want to start, or are currently doing Insanity to stick with it no matter what.

At my best I was 181 lbs but after a week of an all inclusive resort where i broke all my rules and didn't do insanity I went all the way up to 196 :(

1372105377.0,1gzom5,3rd time doing insanity.. some thoughts,brook1yn,25,2,9,"4 weeks in and I have some observations that may be of interest for discussion or for people looking to start:

• A big thing I figured out my second time was that injuries from insanity or outside of can really complicate your work outs. A lot of people rip on akeel(sp?) for not finishing all his workouts, I went through shin splints last time and this time I'm getting over a pulled muscle in my rib cage so I've had to overcome pain a few times to get through these workouts.

• Form- Without a body mirror, flat backs.. Everything is done for a reason. 

• Improvise. My wrists are inherently weaker than I'd like so I bought some push up bars to use for plank work. Comes in handy for ski abs and full body drills. I can keep solid form for the full time instead of taking breaks. Hoping to ditch them soon but for now it works. *Edit* Also after having shin splints and flat feet issues

• Adding on- I felt like, my legs are too tired to take on 40+ mile rides after weeks of insanity. Hoping my body will adjust so I can get back into the game.

• Diet.. Ok, for the protein your body needs for muscle growth.

It feels good to be over my pulled muscle and back in the workout game. Hoping to continue working out hard and progressing onto another series or a hard gym routine. ",self,t5_2ua71,1372162570.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1gzom5/3rd_time_doing_insanity_some_thoughts/

So I finally got started on Focus T25 this morning

This is a completely different setup from Insanity for anyone else who has done it. I did Insanity for the first time in February, and was already sore again just from two weeks. After I finished the second round, I started running, and after two weeks of that, I am back to Shaun T kicking my ass on a daily basis.

So here we go: I wasn't really sure what this was going to be like whenever I pressed play, extremely different. Over the 25 minutes of working out, you will do the exercises in 30-second spurts, which definitely helps to keep the monotony at an all time low.

There isn't a warm-up. There are, etc.).

In the middle of the workout, where you do a selection of the workouts you just did, only much more intensely. You do this again near the end of the workout.

One thing that I was NOT expecting was the hand/foot coordination during some workouts. One in particular was left foot forward/right foot back, and then bring your feet and hands outward twice, then repeat. I'm sure after a few go-arounds, it will become much easier. For me, this particular move was comparable to the side-attack move from Insanity (took me weeks to get it down right without messing up constantly).
By the end of the workout

I have done two rounds of Insanity, I was extremely sore by the end of it, and hoping that soreness doesn't resonate into tomorrow.

There is also a 2-minute cooldown stretch after the 25-minute beatdown. I would suggest to anyone that has to take even the slightest break during this behemoth to use the cooldown stretch to your advantage.

Overall

I would give this particular workout an 8.5/10",self,t5_2ua71,False,,Certified,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1hpqc9/my_review_of_focus_t25_alpha_cardio_just_in_case/

My trainer and I did HIIT training for 6 weeks back in February and I had amazing results (lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks and 15 inches!) I love doing HIIT type workouts.  The adrenaline rush is awesome

My bf purchased the Insanity videos last summer and was trying to get me to do it with him. I asked my trainer about them

To give you an idea of my fitness level back then I was ~210 pounds (5'2 3/4"") with little to no training other than the occasional attempts at jogging. I couldn't do more than 5 jumping jacks, and lunges killed my knees. I was very weak.

Since then I've come a long way. I can squat up to 112 pounds up to 30 times (3 sets, I can do up to 120 jumping jacks in a row, I can mountain climb, plank for a full minute 3 times with 30 second breaks with 5 pound weight on my back. My cardio has greatly improved, I do interval running up a 15% incline hill 4 days a week after work for 45 minutes. I still suck at push ups, but can do them from my knees, or on an incline.

On Friday my bf came over and told me he'll be on training in another province for the month of July (he's military)

I did the fit test, except near the end I started to falter a bit, but watching the video, I wasn't the only one having to back off. Afterwards I was more water than solid, that's for sure!  I had to mop up my workout mats, they were drenched with my sweat!

So my goal is to continue with the trainer twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), Friday, Saturday (45 mins each way), and after work do the Insanity videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday (Saturdays being my rest day). It should take me two and a half months to finish the program.  I told my bf that when he sees me in August he's not going to recognize me. I think this goal is totally achievable

After taking a diet break since March (eating great during the week, and lost my mojo to continue to lose. I think this has re-invigorated me to push to reach my goal of 110-120 pounds. Here are some [pics for reference](http://imgur.com/a/B4eON#0) the first ones are from Day 1 of the diet back in April, the second set are my halfway point in January (taken a week or two before my first HIIT session), and the last are from February after doing HIIT.

I was in decent shape at the beginning of this year. I completed P90x in December, though now I can't find it. 

Week one, then followed the calendar rigidly from there. I learned to pause the stretching near the end and add a minute of lower leg/calf stretching, which I *really* advise to beginners.

I didn't follow the exactly diet plan,000 net each day (with four of the Sunday off days being deliciously higher).

I'm really, and for 5 weeks, I've woken up at 6am to get my workout in before going in to work. Insanity has also kept me honest with my eating habits. I've been eating moderately low carb (&lt;100g a day) and eating mostly whole foods while staying around 1200-1400cals a day (I'm 5'1''). 

My strength and endurance has already improved so much! I rock climb and fly trapeze, I can calculate that I've lost about 10lbs so far. I'm hoping for another 8lbs in month 2. 

Month 2 will bring a couple new challenges though... I'm heading into NYC to visit a friend this weekend and will miss 2 days there. I'm staying with her in her tiny 3rd floor NY apartment and it would be exceedingly rude of me to do the workout there. So I plan to just go for a run in the morning and pick up Insanity when I get home. I also have a camping trip planned to visit my parents in week three. I haven't figured out what I'll do then since that's a longer trip. 

Thanks /r/insanityworkout! You have all been an immense help at keeping me honest and committed. DIG DEEPER!

**Journey:**  
I'll make this brief. So I started at 260 lbs in 2009, gained 40 lbs, and then started to workout again as of August 2011.  I did Insanity, lost fat but looked emaciated.

Started lifting in around April or May 2012, although I certainly admire those that can manage to put in that much effort into their lives.

**Training:**  
Sunday: SS + Insanity Cardio Abs + 20 mins walking @ 3.5 mph  
Monday: Insanity Pure Cardio  
Tuesday: SS + Insanity Cardio Abs + 20 mins walking @ 3.5 mph  
Wednesday: Insanity Pure Cardio  
Thursday: SS + Insanity Cardio Abs +  + 20 mins walking @ 3.5 mph  
Friday: Insanity Pure Cardio  
Saturday: Rest

I love cardio.  I'm a cyclist

**Lifts:** *(current maxes in parentheses)*  

Upper Body:  

* Bent Over Barbell Rows (3x5x135)  
* Barbell Shrugs (3x8x240)  
* OHP (3x5x105 - *without bending my knees*)  
* Squats (3x5x270)  
* EZ Bar Curls (3x8x85)  
(No powercleans due to a worn out rotator cuff)

Lower Body:

* Deadlift (3x5x305)
* Barbell Shrugs (duplicate)
* Squats (duplicate)
* Bench (4x5x175)

**Diet:**  
http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/freakinguy?date=2012-12-04

* IF 18/6 (I eat from 6 pm - 12 am everyday)  
* Currently eating a 1
* No alcohol/cigarettes
* No refined sugars/simple carbs

It's all there.  Blank days are days where I didn't log for one reason or another, nothing like I remembered, but since I drank some I just left it on as having finished the whole thing.  There will be some idiosyncrasies on there, but stuff happens.  It's about consistency more than anything.

Fast food options (if I'm able to have it that day):

* 4x4 animal style (no pickles, protein style

That's basically it.  I can add another 3x3 if I'd like

Snack options: Dried fruit with no sugar added from Trader Joe's.

**Future Goals:**  

* Improve delts
* Improve lats
* Improve traps
* 6 pack
* Bench 225
* Squat 315
* DL 405

***************

I was very excited to open the box this morning. To say the least.

The first exercise on the calendar is Alpha Cardio - Just finished it.
My thoughts: 

T25 a different beast than Insanity. While there is cardio and you do get your heart rate up (and sweat), that makes T25 harder. Plus, you don't get that adrenaline rush/second wind that you do with Insanity. I also miss the class atmosphere of the Insanity video.

Overall Alpha Cardio is an easier workout than any of the Insanity videos. But this is the alpha month

Other things - 
The cool down is an additional 2 minutes AFTER the 25-minute workout.

It's not ""dance-y"". Looking at the ads

Getting done in 25 minutes is really awesome. But you can do the same thing with Insanity month one if you cut out the first stretch (which I did. So sue me).

I am still sweating 20 minutes after finishing

As per requested by a few familiar faces around here

The colors should be by week now rather than 10 days .

Each week's fore-and-background color represents your progress, to the foundation of week 6 and the intensity of your final fit test.  You'll notice that month one has paler colors, while month two has the more vibrant versions of those colors.  Similarly, month one has the black text while month two has the white text.  The rest week is a combination of the first and second halves by combining the dark text with the vibrant yellow.  

Thanks for the suggestions and I hope everyone enjoys the new flair.",self,t5_2ua71,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/zrx4j/flair_updates/

I've just completed my first fit test and I'm SO demotivated..

So first Fit Test: 

* Switch Kicks	50 uglies (I can't get how to do it correctly

* Power Jacks	36

* Power Knees	40 (approximately

* Power Jumps	12

* Globe Jumps	6

* Suicide Jumps	8

* Push-Up Jacks	13

* Low Plank Oblique	36


Not only I feel that I've totally fucked up the form, after that I just felt down. I wasn't even able to complete cooldown routine - while they were doing stretching I was trying to decide if I have enough will power to crawl to trashcan or should I vomit on a carpet and clean it up later(I didn't vomit in the end). Couple of times while doing exercises I felt like I'm about to black out.

Now general information and reflections.

Background: M 39, now about 170 lbs.
I was never in really bad shape - I was in the military, some weights, but it was always sporadic, never followed any kind of diet. Lately I quit drinking soda, but that was about it. So while I was able to work out a couple of times a week, I would swim 1000 meters - it kept me from getting too fat, but once our two girls were born - I was not able to go to the gym any more. For a while I could work out during lunch, once I got a new job - that wasn't working either
 
Here is where Insanity came in. It had to be something I could do at home, and a couple of weeks later I got myself to push ""play"" to see what would happen.
 
My first attempt at a Fit Test failed. I wasn't writing my results, and got back to it the next day. This time I was more prepared as to what to expect, and I completed the test and recorded the results. The main thing the test did was to hook me up. I realized the bad shape I was in, and I took it as a challenge. Overall, I did not miss one day of the program, anthough I did extend it - I split the days with Fit test in Month 2 into two days, and I split one day with Max Abs workout into two, but I quickly came to my senses and wore shoes since.
 
My diet started improving from day one - the body simply would not take any junk. I stopped eating carbs after lunch, I almost completely quit drinking: I had a couple of beers on one occasion, a few shots on another, and one beer last week by myself. I quit smoking weed, which was huge: I used to smoke a little every other day once the kids went to bed, and this would bring in the munchies, so I had to chew on something or have a beer. So almost every day I would get fat right before bed - not a good diet for a 40 year old man. I looked into supplements, and on his advice I started drinking ""Lean Muscle"" - protein drink I found at our discount grocery supermarket. I drink two per day. I should be drinking more water, pastries
 
Injuries: a couple of things that used to bother me before came back: knee pain, but I just push through all fo it.
 
Results (other than Fit test improvements):
 
I lost some weight, and I might go for 32 soon). People comment telling me that they see the difference. I definitely lost some of the muffin top, which was a big goal, more work there left to do. It doesn't look like I gained any muscle, but I am OK with that, at my age I don't want to get any heavier. I did see 169 lbs on ths scale once, something I haven't seen in 9 years. I would like to stay under 170 steady though.
 
The program pushed me to eat better
 
The program gave me structure, pride and I don't know what else kicked me out of the bed every morning. The flow of the video workout helps a lot too: when I used to work out in a gym the breaks would be longer, sometimes I didn't feel like this exersice or the other, or I would just cut the workout short - there is always another day, right? With the video - ""you are in it"", the whole time.
 
Having experience in the military - Insanity brought some memories from those day back. The desperation of pain, I just went with it, and it got easier and better with time.
 
My advice and tips for others:
 
1. Examine your priorities
 
2. Stay with the program. Don't try to be a hero and do more, but if you can't - take a break, and don't get discouraged.
 
3. Invest in your nutrition. Don't starve yourself
 
What's next? Well, follow it with some time of recovery program - Max Sport training with Weights training and Max Abs, or a combination of sorts, then I do Asylum. Wish me luck.

I **need** to lose weight. Yes, perform better (*ahem*), and give my significant other something she actually desires (she deserves it), but the most important thing about all this is that I am in dire need of improving my health. My doctor gave me a fair warning; either I do it or I'm ****ed for the rest of my life.

So... why not go insane? I've seen many people do this. I've visited this subreddit quite a few times. I had never gotten off my lazy ass to actually do it.

But you know what?  I CAN DO IT. 

So I did. I put in the first DVD

* **Switch Kicks:** 115 / I just know I did these wrong. I kicked really low and never tried kicking how I was supposed to. I did not follow form

* **Power Jacks:** 30 / These were hard. My form was ""almost good"". I'm sure I can improve it.

* **Power Knees:** 45 / I did these alright

* **Power Jumps:** 16 / F*** everything about these. I shall kick their ass in the future.

* **Globe Jumps:** 4 / Hot. Damn. Almost fell doing these. These were good.

* **Suicide Jumps:** 6 / Stopped after doing just 2

* **Push-up Jacks:** 3 / ... and damn proud of them. These were the hardest for me.

* **Low Plank Oblique:** 7 / 4 using the right leg

Comments: I ***LOVE*** his motivation. Shaun T's little tid-bits (""Keep pushin'""

I would love feedback, whatever. Just shoot.

As for my diet
munches on sweets on soda drinks on the first place. The biggest disadvantage so far I've found is to be a vegetarian. It would be easy to keep a high protein diet if I was an omnivore, but I still try to do this as best as possible. Important things I do is not eat very late, and keep a balanced meal every time. I usually have an egg omelet after every workout, as well as my whey protein shake.

My name is Seb

Before I summarize my tenure with Shaun T

We offer an accountability group that anyone is free to join [Here!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/364812853588872/)
I encourage all members who want motivation and accountability to go join! We're a very friendly very active community of people helping one another. Keep in mind that not everyone in the group is doing Insanity

Also, so I figure anyone who wants to purchase it, will get thrown in with some random coach that BB assigns you. Instead you can purchase through me, someone who has already done Insanity, and be able to ask me any questions and let me make you recommendations! If you have any more questions you can message me, or email me at phillips.sebastian@gmail.com

**Now to the good part!**

I started Insanity in late may at 212 pounds, dieting, working out every day and the results became addicting. I was losing weight and toning up more than I ever had been in my life. I am FINALLY at a healthy BMI for the first time in my entire life and it feel incredible. It was tough, I don't think anyone will argue that. But if you're thinking about Insanity **DO IT!!!** Stop thinking about what if, or if you can commit, buy it, and do it! You owe it to yourself to try. Unless you have an injury or health condition to prevent you from trying it, do it, having your before and after pictures posted up for the world to see. Don't sell yourself short guys. It's time to stop making excuses and go for it. Month 2 was one of the hardest challenges I have ever had to over come. Yes I slipped up a few times, you won't regret it. I promise

**Workouts:**
Starting the fitness test is definitely overwhelming the first time, don't pause the DVD, just rest. As for days off, I see a lot of people asking about spreading out the first week workouts, in my opinion just stick it out and give your best effort each day and move on. You can always repeat the workout after 60 days, but just keep pushing and do what you can. It's not about completion, it's about the effort you put forward everyday.

**Food:**
I honestly didn't really follow the nutrition guide the whole time, but my portion were way too big and I was eating way to many carbs and too much sodium. So I cut back... a lot and was only eating once a day, which worked for about 5 days, at which point I began to plateau because my body wasn't metabolizing. So finally I started doing 5 smalls meals a day, SMALL meals, SMALL, learn your portion size, not 1, eat often enough to keep your stomach happy. There's a couple really good recipes in the guide

**DON'T**

* Drink Soda
* Eat a Lot of Sugar
* Eat carbs before you go to bed
* Snack on empty calories
* Get Overly Hungry

**Supplements**
I wouldn't really suggest supplements as they're really not needed but Here's what I take.

[Censor Body Fat Burning Pills](http://www.dietspotlight.com/censor-review/) : Not amazing

[C4 Extreme Pre-Workout](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/cellucor/c4-extreme.html): Not for everyone, it's kind of pricey. It's recommended to take 2 scoops prior to a work out, but I take one. Mine has lasted around 45 days, if I had to guess, 2 scoops would only last 3 weeks. So think before going with a pre-workout.

[Whey Protein](http://www.bodyfortress.com/SUPER-ADVANCED-WHEY-PROTEIN-VANILLA): Simple, imo it's almost a necessity to a good workout if you want to build muscle. Drink after every workout.

**Other Helpful Items**

* Yoga Mat (For those recovery days
* Slimming Belt (Really gets the sweat going and helps shed that tummy and love handles)
* [GNC Blender Bottle](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3028914) Omg yes, great if you dont want to use a blender for protein, but still want your, pre-workout and protein to be smooth and not gritty.
* A *good* pair of workout shoes, Etc.) Really keeps your feet in good shape and minimizes chance for injury. **DO NOT WORK OUT BAREFOOT.** Just don't.

That's about it for me. Just don't give up, you deserve to be healthy, don't sell yourself short! You can do it! Let's get this subreddit growing so we can have an awesome supportive community! Dig Deeper and go for it!

1340003854.0,v7rkn,My Insanity story.  Hopefully will be motivating a few of you [Warning: Wall of text],listos,13,2,5,"Rewind a year to when I first became interested in Insanity.  I was a 19, was pretty outdoorsy because I came from a small mountain town

So I decided to get Insanity.  Starting with the fitness test:  It made me light headed.  I had to stop the video in between tests.  looking at my old results of that firs test:  I was only able to do 10 pushups (not pushup jacks lol), 25 low plank obliques, etc... all with a good 5 minute break between each.  

Regardless I continued.  Pushing through day to day.  I would take hefty breaks between workouts, although considering I gained so much strength I must have put on muscle and dropped weight.

I always loved Shawn's motivation, keep my abs tight through the workouts, and do more of the workouts.  I also had to take less and less breaks as I progressed.  The stretches always felt great, and each time I would get better and deeper on each stretch.

Finally, so I had to take longer breaks and rest for a day or two here and there. Despite stopping at 41, insanity did amazing things for me.

Insanity taught me tons about my body, to the gym, do some abs, whatever, I do that stretch.

Because of insanity I became more motivated to get in better shape.  In my second year of college I joined the Triathlon club.  Though Insanity didn't prepare me much for the triathlons specifically, and plan to do more sprints and an Olympic next year.  I went from being able to hardly run a mile on a flat treadmill, to comfortably running 3 miles up and down hills.

Also insanity made me very flexible.  Before insanity, now after insanity (and triathlon granted) I can ... allow me to stand up and try it... touch my fists to the ground in the same stretch, not warmed up.

So now that my second year has ended I plan to do insanity again form the start (meaning my flair is a bit of a lie).  Hopefully

So anyone who is interested in insanity GET THAT SHIT.  It is so worth it.  Take a picture of yourself to get an idea of your fitness before and after.  Follow his guide, as Shawn would say ""DIG DEEPER!""  Keep the videos after you finish the workout and go back to them.  If you want some cardio do pure cardio, if you want some abs do cardio abs, if you just want a stretch skip to the stretch part.  They are a great resource.

Shawn is a great instructor and knows what he's talking about.  And despite him not being in the room with you

Fit Test #1 somewhere between 220-222lbs 31% BF: http://i.imgur.com/18BsorJ.jpg

Fit Test #2 217lbs 28% BF: http://i.imgur.com/Tc1Qqzh.jpg


I'm 23 years old 5'9'' and currently 217lbs. I started exercising 2/17/13 when I was a little over 230lbs doing C25K. A little background on me,soccer,lacrosse), so I was usually in the 165-180lb range. I played a little lacrosse my freshman year in college. The summer after freshman year I was playing on several different summer league soccer teams and broke my ankle pretty badly. I was told I'd be in a cast for 2 months but it was a pretty bad break and 2 months turned into 4 1/2 months followed by 1 to 2 months in a walking boot.

In that time my weight went up to 200lbs. Lost my place on the team because I was out of shape and it hurt my ankle to run. Got depressed but tried to hide it for like 3 years while I ballooned up to 230lbs. Was looking at myself in the mirror a couple weeks before my 23rd birthday and hated what I saw and decided to do something about it.

I started C25K and finished it between 2/17 and 3/21. But it kind of still hurt my ankle to run so I decided to try Insanity. Best decision I've made in a long time. I could barely do Fit Test#1 and was really nervous for what was to come but I have to say I've been really happy the last two weeks and I always feel like I have accomplished something after I finish my days workout.

Week 1

I look at myself in the mirror now and I can tell my face looks different. It's as if all the weight I lost came from my face. My face is back to an 0 shape instead of an O shape. I can't really tell if my body looks different but I wore some shorts this week that haven't fit me in a long time so I guess that's progress.

Before starting Insanity, 5'7"" and 210 pounds back in November.  During my first two and a half months of P90X I lost 10 pounds and 15 inches overall, which isn't horrible but at the weight I'm currently at I felt like the fat should be melting off.  I really needed more cardio in my life.  So I switched to Insanity and over the last four weeks I have lost 5 pounds (now 194), another 3 inches and went from 40% body fat to 34%.  Even though the numbers aren't huge (except body fat%), I definitely feel a difference.  Half my pants are too big for me now, my belly isn't bulging out as much and I feel a lot better physically.  I'm ready for month two!  Progress pics will be posted at the end of the program when I can really see a difference.

1345824611.0,yrcxt,Tips on how to recover from a break.,Phthalate,12,2,2,"If you don't want to read all my personal mumbo-jumbo


**Backstory:** So I had to take a break from Insanity three weeks ago. I had a friend visit me and stay at my place for over a week, I needed to be at work already, only to come back to her wanting to do something. I felt guilty enough to leave her alone for all of the time I was gone, and then to have work out for over an hour (as well as taking a shower and getting dressed again afterwards) while she just waited...


The point is


**Working-out after the break:** I tried to do Max Interval Plyo (Day 45), and by by the end of it, I had absolutely NO energy left. When I saw that the clock still had 26 minutes left, I just went 'This isn't happening'.


This SUCKED. Mainly, mainly because I was doing worse than during my first day of month 2 (Day 36).

**Solution:** I created my own 'come-back week' to try to get right back on track with these workouts. This is what I did:


* Monday (Day 1): Core Cardio and Balance
* Tuesday (Day 2): Rest (I would've done another CC&amp;B
* Wednesday (Day 3): Core Cardio and Balance
* Thursday (Day 4): Core Cardio and Balance (I noticed that I did better this time than I had on Day 34
* Friday (Day 5): Pure Cardio &amp; Cardio Abs
* Saturday (Day 6): Max Recovery
* Sunday (Day 7): Rest

**Coming back to it:** Since I was able to restart this on a Monday, and by the time I came back to my apt, it was 11 PM and my roommates had already gone to sleep. 

I ran MUCH better this day than I ever had (I was able to jog 3 miles in 30 minutes without stopping)

And so I did. Day 44, but what exactly did I do?

**Tips:**

* *Recover at least one day per every 2 days you didn't work out.* For example, I suggest at least the first one be a 'Core Cardio &amp; Balance'.
* *Have one of the workouts be 'Pure Cardio'.* This is just an amazing workout because it will still kick your butt even if you are in Month 2. Throw in 'Cardio Abs' if you had gotten done it too already. If you were almost done with the program
* *If you had more than 3 'come-back' days
* *GET BACK TO IT.* This is the most important thing. Don't lose hope just because your come-back week isn't great. Your body already knows the way to get back *there*

I'd swim every now and then I'm a pretty fair Ultimate player but I'd always get winded after sprinting down the field once (I hate running). After the work out, though I've seen a definite improvement in my endurance, stamina, strength and I'm pretty happy about that. I just joined a mountaineering and skin diving club and to be able to be a full member one has to complete some long runs and endurance swims and the like and I feel like Insanity has helped me ready for that!

How necessary is it to do all 6 days of the recovery week?  I ask for two reasons:

1. I don't want to do the same video 6 days in a row.  (Whiny but true!)

2. I had to take a lot of breaks in Month 1 because of different traveling I had to do.  So it ended up taking me 5 weeks to do the first 4 weeks of Insanity

So

My next question is regarding Month 2.  I've heard a lot about how challenging Month 2 is compared to Month 1.  Because of my ""spaced out"" Month 1
Really the biggest problem I have with Insanity is that I can't do pushups and most of the pushup variations

I'm a graduate of the P90X program (over 1 year ago) and I recently noticed I was gaining weight and becoming pretty lazy. Just got out of a 1 year relationship where my ex-gf dumped me and I thought ""what a perfect time to get back into shape."" Consume myself with a great workout plan, there's the added benefit of ""winning the breakup"" - which will be awesome. I'm doing this for myself first and foremost

I've currently dropped 18.5 pounds in the last month as a result of dieting and looking to tone and shed a few more in the next 63 days. My last day will be the first day back of my Spring semester of college. So I'm looking forward to getting in outstanding shape to ring in the new year.

My weight from day 1 to end 204lb - 183lb


My reasons for doing this work is when I was in highschool about 5-6 years ago I was very fit and athletic. College rolled in and I got lazy and got out of shape and even got a belly. So I always have been trying to do it but I finally muster enough willpower to stick with this program and I have to say I love it.  The feeling I get during and after the workout just feels great. It reminded me of the workouts I used to do. I love these kind of high intensity workouts and fit me very well. 


As to diet


My sample daily meal would be like this

Breakfast: Toast with Orange juice

Lunch: Greek Yogurt and fruits

Dinner: Beef/Salmon with some white rice (im Asian I cant help it) and lots of vegetables.

Late Snack: Greek Yogurt and raw celery/kale (without dressing its still good)


I basically lost all my belly and I have more energy than ever before. My goal now is to get into even better shape (maybe sixpack in teh near future?) My plan currently is I am doing month 2 over again and this time I add cardio abs to every workout and I replace my Thursday stretch with Insane abs. Sunday is still a rest day. 


Anyways I want to thank you for this subreddit because knowing there are people like me and doing this and you guys have been very helpful.

As for diet and what not, and sodas/juices. I tried to control my portions consciously and my appetite has reduced and based itself around 1300-1600 calories a day. I do recommend a few products I have been taking: 

1) **Orgain Protein Meal Replacements** - The best tasting and most complete Protein shake I have found out there (at least for what I want). Available at Whole Foods. I used it routinely as a meal replacement. 
2) **Vega Sport Recover Accelerator** - all organic/natural recovery formula that tastes great. It has the right Carb : Protein ratio, I didn't feel sore one day! (http://vegasport.com/en/recover/recovery-accelerator) You can buy it at any Whole Foods. 
3) **Good Belly Probiotic Drink** - I have always had stomach issues. While eating health helped settle them down
4) **Green Vibrance** - More probiotics and great nutrients from veggies and fruits to supplement your body. 
5) **Alive! Multi-Vitamin** - I have trouble finding time

A) Ignore the pain and keep going
B) Get a good pair of shoes and stay on schedule 
C) Take some time off until my joints feel better and pick up where I left off. 
D) Other? 

If I do take some time off I don't want to stop exercising. Doing this program has made me realize what a difference exercise makes for me

This was a shitty period. 

First week of month 2 was incredibly hard

After that things went downhill. I started to feel lack of energy, my body is too heavy"". Week 2 month 2 I missed 2 workouts and made it up next day(so I had 3 days free, but 2 days with 2 workouts).

I tried to eat more, it didn't help with energy.

I still feel like shit. But I'm close.

**What was done right(but should still be even better!):**

* finally got the feeling of power jumps - look at the numbers! - it helped me a lot, instead of slow and heavy feeling I've had before

* insane abs - I was expecting it to be really hard, but my abs didn't recover properly and I felt raped second time.

**Things to improve:**

* diet - go back to goddamn diet

* push more - but how?

**Overall**:

Shoot me

I am a new redditor and this is my first point so I’m looking forward to some interesting responses. Anyways

Week 1: lost 5 pounds (didn’t follow meal plan)

Week 2: lost 5 pounds (I bought 30 days of Muscle Milk which I drink after working out) **(followed the meal plan strictly)

Week 3: lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly)

Week 4: lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly) 

Week 5: (recovery week) lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly) 

Week 6: lost 0 pounds (became a little loose with meal plan*) *over ate some almonds and cashews

Week 7: I am on day 45 of 63 (math may be off some because I missed some days due to medical reasons and pulled back twice) (back on a strict meal plan)

Meal plan: I eat 5 meals at 300 calories each and I know that’s less then I need but I also realize that I usually go over by having extra fruit throughout the day and maybe other snacks (1/2 cup of goldfish or something relatively healthy). I practically avoid all sweets. I cheated on Christmas eve, cake)

So I did some research on how much weight people lose while doing insanity and I noticed the average was about 20-25 pounds for 60 days and haven’t found anyone that has lost as much as me (I expect to lose more in the next 15 days). 

So here is my question, am I doing something wrong? I plan on getting back on an even stricter schedule tomorrow and see if I can lose another 10 pounds by the end.

Week 1 - I did 4 days in a row. Ate pretty good. Then I took 2 days off. Ate horribly. Finished up my last 2 days and then took 3 days before starting week 2. Needless to say there was no change in my weight or appearance. 

Week 1 - Perfect slam dunk of a week! All 6 days in a row and was slightly under my calorie goal everyday! Down 2 pounds! Woot!

I've made a few adjustments to my original meal plan when I started week 2. If anyone's interested in that I'll post the improved plan.

I read through the guide and did the formula to find out how many calories I needed to eat to get a good starting point.

I found an app that I'm sure many of you know about called myfitnesspal that lets you track your calories consumed and burned. I used this to log my calories and look at carbs vs. protein consumption.  It has made all the difference and pounds just started falling off once I started following it.

1340624303.0,vkfy8,Insanity Day 7 - One Week Down,,10,2,2,"So with one week down I wanted to throw some thoughts I had about Insanity down onto paper (or the internet

**Things I love**

* Most of the workouts are fast-paced and action-packed.  This is first and foremost a cardio workout which is what I enjoy the most.  It's great to be able to just forget about the burn for 20-30 minutes and go for it without having to focus too much on form and agonizing slow-moving moves.  This is a step up for me from the Power 90 workout series that I've done.
* The moves don't require me to pause the video to figure out how I'm supposed to be doing them.  While it was fun on paper
* The workouts are efficient.  I love Tony Horton to death, not 30 seconds of working out because Tony/Shaun talks for a minute about whatever.  Which leads to...
* The workouts are quick.  The longest workout I've done so far was 44 minutes
* It's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be.  I'm pretty overweight and I'm limiting how hard I push myself by using a heart rate monitor
* I'm already feeling the results.  While my weight is on the rise, while I'm an incredibly long way from having anything resembling rippling abs, I haven't woken up with indigestion since I started the workout.  On top of that, my bowel movements have all been pretty solid and easy to come by, even when I ate spicy wings this past week.  Normally after eating wings the next morning is a tough decision between speeding to work and possibly shitting my pants on the way there or waiting around to have diarrhea and going in 20 minutes late.  

**Things I don't like**

* Frankly? There isn't much.  There's a few folks in the tapes that I dislike solely based on how they conduct themselves

**Other thoughts**

* I'm having foot pain while warming up which I'm attributing to my shoes not being wide enough.  It's a similar pain to breaking in new ice skates for those who are familiar.  I think as my blood starts flowing and my feet swell  my shoes become cramped.  I ordered new cross training shoes that are a proper size so hopefully that fixes that ailment.
* I used an online target heart rate formula to determine what my range should be.  My resting heart rate of 90 and my age of 25 yielded me with a lower bounds of 134 and an upper bounds of 174.  My average heart rate over the workouts has been around 150-155 (keep in mind that's including the stretches and about 2 minutes of cooldown after the final stretching) and my calories burned per workout is around 900-950 from the time I take my recovery.
* During the opening warmups I give 75-85% for the first two rounds and then aim to have my heart rate peak around 175 right before the stretch.  This brings it to around 135 by the end of the stretch and then I spend the rest of the workout keeping it between 135 and 175 (averaging around 155).  
* For recovery I'm taking one scoop of whey isolate with around a tablespoon of chocolate syrup and 8 oz. of milk blended together.  I'm following the Phase 2 P90X diet.
* For the first 5 days, too.
* I noticed a huge difference in my endurance during the second Plyo workout of the week.  Besides having more cardio endurance
* Because of how out of shape and overweight I am
* I definitely recommend having a workout buddy to keep you motivated while using a heart rate monitor to pace yourself.",self,t5_2ua71,1340624531.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/vkfy8/insanity_day_7_one_week_down/

However, I noticed that my calves (more like the inner front of them) were... not so much sore, but just in pain.  It was the fit test so I gave it my all (improved in everything but switch kicks, hooray).  Then yesterday during Plyo Cardio, about halfway through, I had to take long breaks because of the pain.

I always try to land softly

I did some research and saw that the location of the pain may indicate shin splints.  I went out and bought a few things: arnica gel and a foam roller.  They helped to a point

I also booked an appointment with an orthopaedist for Friday morning.  I'm prepared to ask questions like

What I'm not prepared to hear is that I need to stop :(

Today was Pure Cardio and Cardio Abs.  The Ab section was pretty ok, etc.)  The pain came back when I was done.  I did some massage to the area and used the foam roller, which has helped loosen it up a bit.

This is really bumming me out, it seems stupid - but that's how badly I want to finish the full two months.

I don't know how many people are doing Asylum in this sub

This post is two things: first, a review of the first week. Skip down to the bottom if you only want the deets on Asylum's first week.

How I Got Here
--

First off, 33 years old. I was 255 lbs, and doing Power 90 and Power 90 Master Series lost me about 55 pounds. Then, I found Insanity...

First round of Insanity was amazing. I had never had such an awesome workout before. As a 200 pound guy (still classified as obese at that point I think) it was brutal on my joints as I already had bad knees. Then, and those basically cured my issues with my knees. I was able to jump around like a silly fool!

The first month of Insanity was a lot of trial and error. I was trying hard to figure out how best to lose weight with the new calorie restrictions I had to impose on my diet. Previously, to truly maximize my weight loss. Well, that didn't work out quite right, as I ended up overeating when following the diet plan.

I tried to hit my macros (40:40:20 Protein:Carb:Fat) but eating that in 5 meals a day was difficult, my number to hit was supposed to be 1500 calories. 5x300 calorie meals was unfeasible. So I switched to 3x500, and that worked much better. Now, I eat 2x750 (a little less actually since I am so close to my goal). It's important to note that frequency of meals isn't really important (the 6 meals a day to stoke the metabolic fire thing is a myth, based on faulty inferences from how the body reacts to digestion).

Insanity also had a recovery day mid-week, in week 4, the Wednesday was Plyo Cardio Circuit and Thursday was Cardio Recovery, so I did the Plyo workout, had my recovery drink (a protein shake), and then started fasting. I wouldn't eat until just after the Cardio Recovery workout the next day. It was very comfortable and easy to do. After all was said and done, I felt awesome!

I lost 15 more pounds.

For Round 2, with the first 2 months seeing me lose another 10 pounds (putting me at 160 after a mini-back-slide). The P90X stuff was a welcome addition, but the cardio portions of P90X were just not up to snuff. P90X grads usually complain about how hard Plyo X is/was, but man, I had no trouble what so ever.

I had a bad month in month 3. Unfortunately for me

I was struggling with my diet, I'd have to get really hardcore, really strict... I'm currently eating the same meal every day, hitting the 40:40:20 split exactly, at precisely 1400 calories.

Enter the Asylum...

Week 1 of Asylum
--

Asylum is only 1 month long. The official workout routine has week 1 like so:

* Day 1: Fit Test
* Day 2: Speed &amp; Agility
* Day 3: Strength
* Day 4: Back to Core
* Day 5: Vertical Plyo
* Day 6: Rest
* Day 7 and onward -- it is a 3-day then Relief (like recovery in Insanity) with 2 more workouts

The calendar is not like we're used to with Insanity, where you do a stretching routine. Shaun T also recommends you do Relief every day if you are inflexible (I don't, though, despite not being as flexible as I should be).

I wanted to wait before I posted this until I had a chance to complete Game Day and Overtime


**Fit Test**

This fit test is, but harder to accurately gauge your performance. It takes a bit of practice to get the moves right (agility heisman, shoulder tap, and bear crawl for example), but the same can be said for most of Asylum. The program in itself is about agility and coordination, and part of that is doing complicated (or rather, more complicated than Insanity) moves within certain constraints. The agility ladder is how this is accomplished. In my opinion, too. I like having a target

The order of the moves tests different parts of your body

Fit test is:

* Agility Heisman
* In &amp; Out Ab Progression
* Lat Push-Up OR Pull-Up
* Mountain Clumber Switch Kicks
* Agility Shoulder Taps
* X Jumps
* Moving Push-Ups
* Agility Lateral Shuffle
* Agility Bear Crawl

**Speed and Agility**

That damn jump rope... 

Mountain Climber Progression and Moving Push-Up Progression are where you get your ass kicked. Most of the other moves are agility stuff, quite fun. The Moving Push-Up progression in particular, where you do a moving push-up, then jump into the ladder (you go from plank after push-up to pulling your feet into the ladder where your hands just were, much like a power push-up -- it's brutal). 

*Shaun T: ""it only counts when you're tried."" Oh fuck

**Strength**

I absolutely loved this workout. Halo Deadlifts were awkward

Progressive Dumbbell rotation was a beast. The level 3 is curl -&gt; squat -&gt; push-up -&gt; spider left

*Shaun T: ""I laugh at pain"".*

**Back to Core**

Hmm, it's a lot of control and focus routines. I suppose you can liken it to Core Cardio and Recovery. The Swimmer Band Exchange is probably the most interesting part of the workout (if you do it right!).

**Vertical Plyo**

Similar to Speed and Agility, the Resistance Power Jumps (Power Jumps with resistance bands on your legs) are really weird and difficult. I enjoy Power Jumps as is, but with the bands on your legs, man, it screws you up; it's hard to gauge just how to control your legs during the jump with the resistance. Similarly, Resistance X Jumps are just what they sound like: X-jumps with resistance, and it is awkward.

Lastly


**Game Day**

I haven't done this yet

**Overtime**

I haven't done this yet. It's a little more push-ups


**Note:** I didn't modify any exercises except for the pull-ups (mountain climber) -- I opted for lat push-ups instead.

**Overall Positives**

* NO TONYA! Hurray! I know this will draw ire from some of this subreddit's denizens
* A lot of the old crew are back
* The new moves are refreshing and in a lot of cases difficult and challenging.
* Some weight lifting!
* The music is better for pushing you -- IMO

**Some Negatives**

* Not enough warm-up (generally)
* The amount of stretching is generally reduced, I tend to use a foam roller before and after the workouts.
* Requires a bit of practice (e.g. ladder drills)
* Only 1 month long; implies you will need to do it over again
* Requires equipment: agility ladder, not like the bands you replace free weights with) [optional], pull-up bar [optional], jump-rope [optional].

**Random Observations**

* Shaun T looks shredded in this
* Martin, Martin is dead at the end of it. Oh, Martin!).


Closing Thoughts
--

Asylum is turning out to be a really fun and challenging workout. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, but overall I am really enjoying it. Once I nail the moves down and am able to really push myself (and not hit the ladder!) I feel like I will see awesome results. 

My current plan for exercise is to finish Asylum (I'm done round 1 of Volume 1 on May 25th) then do Body Beast to bulk-up a bit

Sure it's a workout and I'm burning calories but I started it with the specific goal of building endurance to make me a better athlete.

Last night I scrimmaged for the first time since I started and I noticed a HUGE change. We played with 6 girls on each team instead of the usual 14. We do this a lot and I normally feel exhausted after. Last night I managed to stay strong for the entire hour and a half. Of course I still got winded but I used to get so tired I would lose skating ability. I played at the top of my game the whole time!!!

Thanks guys for always being inspirational and clicking play!

I'm curious what did it. Did I push too hard? Did I gulp the water instead of little sips? Was the water too cold? Is it because i had the insanity special sandwich 30 mins before starting?

So here's a little bit about me. I started doing Karate when I was 5 and didn't stop until high school. I regularly competed (and won) on a national level. When I  started college, and my fraternity obligations increased, personal fitness was put on the backburner. Excuses excuses. I basically haven't done any real exercise or eaten healthy in about 5 years. Oh, and I smoke about a pack a day. Off to a great start right? Then, well fuck, going on 2 years ago now, the girl I saw myself marrying left me. I sunk into a pretty deep depression, but I'm finally ready to do something about it. 

I'm 25, 150ish lbs, my endurance is horrible, I have next to no muscle left on me, and I carry a spare tire around my waist every day... now, why Insanity? Well, I have a very strong background in body weight training (hate lifting weights - so boring). I'm weak enough that while eating enough calories I'll surly build some muscle (as hard as pushups currently are, and no, or gain weight

In my opinion

That having been said, but Month 2 is ***where it's at***. It feels so good to get back into it. I'm coming off of a rest week as well, so to finally bust out the hour-long, ass-kicking, super-fatiguing intervals, is a huge relief to me. I know rest weeks are important, but man was that ever testing my patience.

I suppose I feel this way because I recognize how effective Month 2 was for me the first time around. I'm so close to my goal and I just know I'll hit it in a couple of months (this hybrid is 90 days

This is my second time doing insanity - however I have not done it since last April. I was about 2 weeks from finishing and I sprained my ankle stepping off a curb in Vegas. Totally sober!

Anyways - back at it again. Goal #1 - Mexico on January 26th
 
After that I'll switch to p90x or something - or maybe a hybrid. Where I hope to lose another 5lbs before end of May. (goal 120lbs)


Meal Plan:
5:00 am: Wake up

5:20 am: Workout

6:05 am: Small glass of chocolate milk

7:00 am: Unsweetened Almond Milk, Table spoon of natural peanut butter all mixed up.

7:30am: green tea

10:00 am: Greek Yogurt Fat Free

12:00 pm: Green Salad with lots of veggies, balsamic vinaigrette

2:00 pm: Apple

5:30-6:00 pm:This will vary from day to day - but essentially a meal will consist of protein

8:00pm - Almond Milk


On Day 3 today - hamstrings are tight as all hell ( so are my calves and glutes but not nearly as much) - any suggestions?

Also do we count rest days as a day on here - like will my rest day be day 7 or will the first day of my second week be day 7?

Today on the fourth day I'm proud to say I finally finished it 100% with no breaks. It felt amazing and my shoulders were on FIRE........but so rewarding and worth it.

Fit Test is still hard

**What was done right:**

* first week - lots of enthusiasm and ""push through"" spirit

* finally understood the form of some excercises that were hard for me

* excercising barefoot is great

* bought heart-rate monitor - nice to see how many calories you've burnt through the workout

* stretches - I'm really bad at being flexible

* feeling great(until you get to work out again

**What will be done better:**

* **DIET** - I've been eating crap, refused to have other food through the day - double fail! Since today I'm following Insanity guide. Proatmeal tastes like vomit even with berries, and Insanity Special Sandwich is disgusting too(I hate bread), but I'm looking forward to try other recipies. I print out the journal page in the evening, choose what I want to eat tomorrow, then check the fridge if I have all groceries I need and go to the store. Protocoling my diet makes me feel more responsible.

* motivation - week 2 was kinda down

* schedule - I definitely need to sort out my schedule to work-out at the same time(more or less) every day. This one is tough

* better warm-ups - got some knee pain for a day or two

Notes:

* I still want to continue working out barefoot

* heart-rate is going down constantly - am I slacking or is that the way body adjusts?

I would also like to thank you all for your support! Especially

Now, and for the past week and a half, I haven't had an erection unless my girlfriend stimulated me to do so and we've both been busy so that's been few and far between. So, today I was showering and the lo-and-behold my member is standing at attention and it tacked on about .20inch girth and length. I've heard that sometimes this might happen during exercise, but I didn't think it would happen hear. Anyone else? Or am I alone? Just curious. Sorry if it was a bit inappropriate.

I do have one concern. My lower back is still aching a little bit during and briefly after the exercise. I know there was a post earlier in the week, when singing is not occurring, you relax the muscles...basically to re-energize and recover. Do these things hold true in exercise as welll?

1356726445.0,15l7mm,Question about nutrition...,BGFlick,8,3,7,"Hi fellow crazies!

Before I ask my question

 So about a year ago I decided to change, 375 pounds, unhealthy as hell, and had bigger breasts than most women did (I'm a dude). Since early January of last year, I managed to drop my weight down to 265, on nothing other than running and doing some weight training, and eating smaller portions and limiting myself to a 2, I am completely ignorant on the facts of nutrition

That being said, my ass has never been kicked so hard. To my surprise, I've been able actually make it through the majority of the workouts, maybe not at the pace of most, but I am able.  I dig deep and push through.  I've also dropped my weight to 262 since I started, and I can see the changes in the mirror, my body is getting more toned and my fat is starting to shift to different places, I have ankles now!

Part of my problem in life is that I am a insanely picky eater, protein shakes, and on rare occasions I like to cook a small sirloin.  With that in mind, I am human, and if I do not cheat on my diet I'll literally go insane, no pun intended.  I LOVE pizza, I LOVE pasta

Now onto my question.  Since i'm completely ignorant when it comes to nutrition, and consume a a total of 60 grams of fat (large amount, just example) but I only burn 40 grams, will my weight not change?  I know you have to burn more calories than you consume to lose weight, but I don't understand how fat works into the equation.  Could someone shed some light onto this for me, preferably in a way an nutrition ignorant person can understand?

Sorry if this isn't the place to turn

First off I'd like to say thank you for posting in this sub. Seeing everyone's before and after pictures is incredibly motivating!!!

I am technically in my fifth week of Insanity, Friday, and Saturday so I'm re-starting week 4. I am feeling super bummed out right now because I don't understand why these videos aren't getting any easier for me. I've essentially been doing the same workout videos for a month, yet every time I fire it up I'm feeling the exact same amount of exhaustion every time. After a month shouldn't I be breezing through the videos? Yesterday I was doing cardio power and resistance and could not even get through the warm up without taking a few breathers. 

Is this normal? Is anyone else experiencing the same frustration? Am i doing something wrong? Are my expectations way too high? 

This is something that's really bothering me and I'm worried it will start to affect my morale. I can definitely see results on my body already. My quads, and obliques are WAY more developed and I'm seeing more muscle on myself. I'm not seeing much weight loss/fat loss...probably cause I'm not following the diet program but I might change that in month 2. Ill post the results of my fit test below. Thanks for reading this, I know it was a lot but I really need to blow off some steam to someone who knows what I'm facing here.

1346048983.0,yw5h8,Insanity Success Story - Lost 60lbs over 1 year - mainly thanks to 2 rounds of Insanity,Samethingbrah,7,0,4,"Hello All
I just stumbled upon this subreddit from a link that made it to the top few pages of reddit. I felt compelled to share my story since I have had much success with Insanity and thought it might motivate some people

Backstory: 
Shortly after I got engaged I decided it was time to lose some weight. Not only did I want to do this for my wedding, I never really felt satisfied after a workout unless I was absolutely fatigued -- Insanity takes this satisfaction to an entire new level. 

Once I got into the first week, cutting out sweets, beer, diet soda. I tried to maintain an intake of 1200-1500 calories per day. I also would make sure to eat something every few hours, generally snacking on a protein bar, or something in between meals. By the end of the 60 days - I weighed 218. So I dropped about 20lbs during insanity. Also, interestingly enough, I dropped another 5lbs even though I had not been doing any exercising (I feel this is mainly due to my increased muscle mass from the program

I remained fairly inactive for the remainder of the summer

I started this round at the beginning of October, once I got to the second month – I made another dramatic change to my diet – I decided to cut out all chicken and red meat / and almost all Fish – basically Vegetarian. My reasoning behind this is a whole other post in of itself.  I chose to do it right though – I bought a book called “transitioning to vegetarianism” and made sure that I was supplementing my diet with plenty of protein, and vitamins and minerals that you cannot get from just veggies. 

After I finished the second round of Insanity – I never felt better. I was down to about 203lbs. I continued in my Vegetarian diet through the holidays
Since then I have actually done Insanity for a 3rd time – but did not really lose any weight as I was focused more on just maintaining – I did get much more toned though. In summary I would just like to offer some tips/advice/notes from my experience with Insanity. 

* I would recommend it to anyone – I have recommended it to many people already! (unless you have medical    issues with your back or knees – see your doc first) 
* The first week of each month is the hardest – STICK WITH IT
* I started to see the most dramatic results in the last week and a half of each month. – results will come! Stick with it! 
* My favorite thing about Insanity is that it really just makes you feel lighter on your feet
If anyone has any questions for me regarding my experience

**Tl;dr Lost 60lbs doing Insanity and eating right. Changed my life! Would recommend it to anyone! Have done 3 rounds and looking forward to completing Insanity:Asylum**

Im just excited to start getting back in shape.  Little back story on me since I am bored at work.

I was a typical guy that found out how easy it was to just eat fast food all the time.  Even after getting married my wife and I kept up that disgusting habit.  Then december 6, really put it into perspective for me and that day I started to take stuff seriously.

On june 6th was my 6 month mark for my wife and I not having fast food.  Granted we still go to resteraunts and dont always get the low carb low calorie meals

The doctor said I would most likely be insulin dependant for the rest of my life and all that there was to do really was maintain.  I took that as a challenge.  After 1.5 months with diet alone I was taken off of insulin and 1 month after that taken off of oral medicine as well.  I have not had any sugar regulating medicine since febuary 14th.  

Now with that being said

I am hoping that I can experience some of the same results you great people have and be able to submit some awesome before and after pics to you all in about 61 days.  

I do have one question though.  I work 12 hour rotating shifts of either 6 am to 6 pm or 6pm-6am.  Does anyone here work a similar schedule and have advice of how to make this system work with the tyoe of schedule I have

So far I've done the fit test + max circuit and max plyo and yes, I keep up with everyone in the video, but I did have a little trouble keeping up with all the push-ups in max plyo today, although I could probably chalk that up to having tired arms before starting tonight. I'm expecting that to get better though!

Also

Is this pretty common? Should I be pushing harder?

I've been going to the gym for about 4 months prior to this and I do a bit of light lifting and various other strength exercises. I haven't gone since I started Insanity but I'm planning on going today and topping up my upper body since the workouts so far have been very cardio dominated
