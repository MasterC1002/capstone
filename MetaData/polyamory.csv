1364841934.0,1bfucv,"Dinner with my daughter, her boyfriend, his other girlfriend and her other boyfriend.",DEZ1255,338,46, EM, so we are having “our” Easter next week.)  My daughter suggested the group come to our house to make it.

I confess I was incredibly nervous to let a swarm of strangers descend on my kitchen, RA, made roast lamb and seasoned rice.  They also made stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.  His other girlfriend, TL confessed to being “rubbish in the kitchen,” and insisted on “staying out of the way” and playing Scrabble with me while we waited for dinner. (I’m sure my daughter told her I like Scrabble, and it was nice to have something to do instead of suffering through small talk completely undistracted.)  She set the table and later did dishes, which was pleasant enough even though she didn’t know where anything was.  Her other boyfriend, made cocktails and crème brulee

I’m not sure if any other parents frequent this forum, laughing together and helping each other, before sitting down to eat.  I also appreciated having tasks to do with TL, both playing Scrabble and showing her where dishes were.  It gave us an chance to talk without having talking be the spotlight of our initial interaction.

TL and I were the ones with most opportunity to talk, I believe it.  They don’t seem to be competing with each other for RA’s attention at all, and in fact they were going out of their way to make sure they each had enough time with him.  TL was even fishing for gift ideas for EM and RA’s anniversary, which I had never even considered was something she, as “the other woman,” would care about.

Talking with my therapist,” when one person dates multiple partners separately with the intention of narrowing it down to one monogamous partner.  Even though my daughter had been telling me that this is not the case, I was still reacting as if it were.  Seeing the group together really helped me to see that TL was not taking RA away from my daughter.  In fact, they were all solicitous and caring of each other.

I still have concerns about EM moving in with these people, and how angry, and then how they turned out to be…really nothing to worry about.  I’m just thankful that my daughter and her relationship did not hold against me my fears, concerns, or, yes, even my prejudice.  I judged them unfairly and they turned the other cheek.

Next week, TL and JM.  If she does, I know I will stand by her side.  By their sides.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1bfucv/dinner_with_my_daughter_her_boyfriend_his_other/

I’ve got two boyfriends. Two deadly, I’ve managed not to fuck it up completely. Somehow. Fuck knows how. Probably mostly luck. Anyhoo, this track record of having thus far not fucked things up entirely and being actually very happy has put me in a funny position; people ask me my opinion a lot. My opinion on polyamory, open relationships and advice on generalised sluttery. So for those of you who want it, here’s my handy dandy cut-out-and-keep guide/FAQ to what I’ve figured out in the last few years.

DISCLAIMER: There is no one twue way with this shit. Fuck

So

1. Rules. Bollocks to rules. When you put rules in place the natural inclination is to find loopholes. You end up violating the spirit of the rule while following it to the letter, trust is what it’s all about. More on trust to follow). What you want, really, is operating principles; a system of good practice; good motherfucking habits. That’s what you want. Most of this list is kind of an outline of what I think are good operating principles.

There are a couple of exceptions to the “no rules” rule

2. It’s ALL about trust. Everything else sits on a foundation of trust. Good ways to build trust are:

-Do what you fucking say you will. Be consistent. Never, so much that you wanted to set his van on fire? Don’t be that guy, because people remember when you failed to do what you said you would, regardless of how seldom that is.

-Never fib

-TELL YOUR PARTNER THINGS BEFORE THEY ARE FORCED TO ASK. FUUUUUCK

-If possible, try not to lose the rag. These things happen.

3. You love your partner, for the same reasons. If so, cut them some slack! Don’t try to control their interactions with other people too much. They’re with you, so they must have pretty good taste, right? Trust them to manage their own relationships. This is the reason I think vetos are horseshit. They’re too easily abused for a start. The exception to this is if you have privileged information regarding someone that your partner is interested in being bad news of some sort. Then you should present that information to your partner. If they want to bang someone you personally despise, then you can say “I’d rather you didn’t, as I personally despise that person for reasons X, that is probably because they are 7 years old and you’re a sicko.

4. We, talk to each other. And work on being a good listener. Don’t argue to win, argue to negotiate. Try to be calm and reasonable when your partner is telling you things you might be less than thrilled about so that they feel safe telling you things in general. Nobody likes feeling like they’re invoking a shit-storm every time they try to voice their feelings.

5. BE KIND! If there is something that will make your partner wildly happy but will bum you out a little or inconvenience you a bit, shut up and stop pestering them to bring you to funderland if it was the scene of the brutal death of their childhood dog Popsy or whatever. But, you know, the slutty sex version of that analogy. DO NOT BE A DOORMAT. Voice your feelings as accurately as possible.

6. Don’t go hunting unicorns (or waterfalls). Relationships and sexual attraction are supercomplex. It’s hiiiiighly fucking unlikely that you’re going to meet someone who is equally attracted to both of you. Just do stuff with people you like and allow your partner to do the same. You never know how things might go.

7. Be careful with your language. I fucking ABHOR hierarchical polyamory. If you label someone as secondary, de facto starts as tertiary or whatever you want to call it. Fucking shades into dating shades into casual relationship shades into serious relationship. Some stay casual forever and that’s cool. Some get serious. Also cool. But if you refer to someone as secondary you are:

a) telling them from the off that THEY AS A PERSON ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAN SOMEONE ELSE. Which is horrible

b)making it difficult for the relationship to progress in its own happy little way. I mean

8. Remember, consideration and kindness. Your metamours are not your rivals. They are someone that someone you like likes. Don’t encroach on their space or generally treat them in any way you would not like to be treated.

9. Question: Hey quellehorreur
Answer: I have no fucking idea. There’s no etiquette book for this crap. Talk to everyone and check to see if everyone’s happy.

Don’t worry if you fuck up once in a while. It happens. I’m completely certain I’ve fucked up on every single one of these points. Multiple times. I just try not to do it so much as I go. I’m naturally a controlling asshole, it’s oh so worth it.

Thank you, I didn't know much about this community at all.


But I do have one issue. In my browsing, not open minded, not honest with their partner, etc. 
I understand a lot of monogamous relationships have things that a successful poly relationship does not. However


In my monogamous relationship, etc. And it's not an issue. (We'll actually point out people to each other if we think the other person would find them attractive!) We're very secure in our relationship- especially when it comes to not being afraid to lose the other person to someone else. 


We're also open minded and accepting of other ideas and lifestyles. The thing is, the reality wouldn't be one we'd like to have happen. 
Please know that the lines of communication for us on these issues is very much open- we just choose not to take the step that other types of relationships have.


It doesn't mean we're prone to jealousy

On that note


In short, and I'm very happy to see so many of you in loving relationships with people who have made your life a better place.

The next week goes by and I do my best to avoid typos like the plague. I made one in an entire week (and typed REEEEAAAALY SLOW) but I made it though with just the one.

Today I was called in by the boss and told that I had not improved at all and that I was still making far too many mistakes. I asked for an example

Folks

You don't like it, but there *are* people out there for whom a OPP works. There are happy unicorns who have found their unicorn hunters. There are poly couples who do it primarily for the sex - this does not make them swingers or ""non-poly"". 

Quit trying to TELL people in this sub ""how to do it right."" It's ridiculous. There are many paths. Here's the only true way to be polyamorous:

Step 1: Don't be monogamous.

I know a bunch of you, and give us all lists. You want to define it, and you want to speak for the majority, and you want to be an expert. Nobody asked you, but you're going to tell us all the perfect way to be perfectly poly.

Quit it. You're wrong.

Some background:
I grew up with my Mom, with Mom in the middle. Mommy and Dad did try to make it a triangle, but it never worked. The V formed in the mid 70s, if I remember correctly. They were together for 20-some-odd years. They did break up around 2000, for fairly complex reasons. It was a combo of personality conflicts and lingering trauma from a murder in the family, as far as I've been able to piece together.

My parents were closeted about the poly. Mommy was ""a friend of the family"". I'm told it was pretty obvious to anyone open-minded enough to look past the legal marriage between Mom and Dad.

I was born in the mid-80s

So! Ask me anything. :) I'll answer if I can.

Married the love of my life 7 years ago, I can only recall 3 actual arguments, and all of those were mediated through communication and worked through. She and I complement each other perfectly. 

We do both, but much more often, we pursue deeper relationships with others - she currently has a BF of 4 years (and I think this may be a lifelong thing for them) that lives with us when he's home from deployment. He and I get along fantastically. I also have several GFs, the most serious of which we will call C. My wife and I tend to share her relationshipwise - my wife is extremely bi, and she and C have a thing for each other as well. C and I have been in love for 2 years, and she is also military, so I only get to see her when her duties allow. 

She deployed last year, and the plan was that she'd arrive Friday night at long last. I had been looking forward to this like a kid awaiting Xmas. 

Thursday is ""cheat night"" for our diet. My wife and I usually order from a local excellent restaurant that delivers and wallow in carbs for that one meal a week. Keeps us on the diet. I came home, I realized she hadn't ordered dinner yet.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years (we are both in our early 30s) and we love each other very deeply. We've been poly for the last five years and we both have had multiple other partners. We've always had our rules and one is that we never would put someone else ahead of each other. And that we would be careful. 

I'm just learning he broke both our rules. Since we became poly I've had more partners than him but my partners have been less serious. He has had three serious girlfriends and a couple short term flings. I've had maybe 10-15 flings since we started and a couple longer relationships (but nothing as serious as his GFs). He hasn't been supportive of my relationships like I have of his but he hasn't been jealous either. He doesn't like to talk about my poly experiences and I have always tried to respect that. 

My husband started to date a new girl around last November. This girl is a little plainer than his normal type but she seemed nice enough. We never struck up a friendship but I just figured she must be shy and it would be awkward to be friends with your boyfriend's wife... especially if you are new to poly. As it always is things were amazing with them at first and I cheered my husband on. I was happy to see him happy. But I noticed they had become more secretive and he started to be less caring and loving to me. 

Well fast forward to today and my husband tells me that he is leaving me and wants a divorce immediately. He told me I am a slut and a failure as a wife since I never gave him a child (we have had three miscarriages over the last four years so that was extra shitty of him to say). He told me that he hated when I went and slept with other guys and he regretted ever meeting me. Keep in mind he never once told me this before. And then to just twist the knife in more he told me that he is leaving me because his new girlfriend is so awesome and he can't bear the thought of cheating on her. And she is pregnant. I begged him to stay and reconsider and he told me he made his decision and we are over. 

I don't know what to do. I just feel abandoned and lost and destroyed. I don't have anyone IRL I can talk about this to. I can't believe my own husband would do this to me. I can't believe my marriage is over and I can't believe that my husband is having a baby with someone else other than me. I'm not a hateful person but I truly

EDIT: Thank you

I think what hurts more than him leaving is how much he betrayed me. He would always just say things were meh with the GF to me (even when things were clearly awesome). He lied about using condoms with her. I've never once let someone else not use condoms. That was one of our major rules. And his GF is 16 weeks pregnant so they have known for a while and he never spoke a word to me. Its just so fucked up. How could my partner do me like this? A lot of the things he said were so hurtful and he knows what hurts me and used that to his advantage. It was just cruel. I wish I still didn't love him or care but I do.

These might help and they're the ones I make with my partners.  They have to be mutual.

1.I will maintain my own mental and physical health

2.If new partners are going to become involved with me sexually

3.I will never leave you for someone else nor at someone else's request.  If I leave, or dangerous.  

4.What I do with my other partners should not damage our relationship.  If it begins to

5.I will leave an open line of communication for negotiation about our relationship, or a particular place. 

6.We can renegotiate our relationship at any time.  You are free to leave if you choose to. 

7.Legal bindings must be negotiated with 1-6 in mind wherever possible.  

8.I will dedicate a portion of my time to making sure your needs are met.  If your needs change

I've noticed that the rule most people seem to employ here amounts to ""polyamory is loving however/whoever makes you happy ... as long as you aren't unicorn-hunting

I think more people should realize that some individuals/couples **want** to have a OPP, there's probably some people who dig it*.

Just because someone hasn't gravitated to your particular set of no-rules-except-my-rules polyamory doesn't mean they aren't open-minded or will someday see it your way ""when they mature"". They might just be content with what they are doing already.

All I'm sayin' is that maybe you shouldn't jump on and hate. Unicorns do exist

In my case, I'm so weird in the head that I want him to sleep with hot girls with or without me, while I only want to do so with him ... the only rule in our case is that he (with her consent) takes vids/pics of his adventures. Mmm. :)

Our setup satisfies me completely as an individual and makes the love of my life happy as well

Background: my wife and I (10 years) opened up our marriage a little over a year ago.  We had dabbled (mostly successfully) with non-monogamy for almost six months when she and her now long distance boyfriend first met. 

Last weekend he flew into town for a four day weekend, (yes, it was terrific!) but for me the best part about the entire weekend was not about sex at all. 

Going in to the weekend, and the two of us are closer now than ever before. Sometime over the weekend though, my perspective shifted, and I realized that polyamory really works for me.

Over the course of the weekend, my fantastic wife found the time to go out of her way to make sure that I wasn't feeling neglected. 

Meanwhile, and make more room for him in our lives, in my life.  Even though he and I have only recently become friends, I can now say honestly that I have accepted him into our family, and that I love this man. My life is better for having him be a part of it.

The brinksmanship went on until I told her we had to separate for a time to cool off and hopefully get some perspective, so I went on a vacation without her.

Before I left though, I felt like I had been replaced a bit. She wanted to date and/or have sex with him at least twice a week, but wouldn't have sex with me because she didn't feel close to me after all the fighting we had done.

I don't think I would have been able to get over my jealousy if it weren't for the fact that this guy is so incredibly awesome and caring it has inspired us to be waaaay better to each other.  He has been patient and considerate of my feelings the whole way since he knows she and I are still repairing things

Personal lesson- Don't be a jerk someone you love

About being poly - Having many lovers is so potentially wonderful because you are able to get closer to each other by having many points of reference.  My wife's bf understands her better in ways that I don't (they are more creative together, she has observed that he and I interact differently than she and I do, and so she has more appreciation for me as well.  You can be each other's teachers when you share love with people you trust and admire, which is what it is all about :)

Most commonly this is a male/female couple who are interested in finding a bisexual woman to date them both exclusively (though you can certainly have any gender in any of those roles!).  This is such a common place for couples interested in getting started in polyamory that it’s actually a cliché

The first thing to realize about unicorn hunting is that, bisexual, sexually open woman.  Out of the limited pool of hot, bisexual, sexually open woman many of them are just not inclined to date a couple (more on that in a bit), and the ones that are have all the single people on the planet to pick from in addition to all those other unicorn hunters…the numbers are just not looking good for you.  The numbers get a lot worse if you’re picky and want to set your bar at “compatible” rather than “available”.

Let’s say you do manage to corner a unicorn though, right?  So now it’s time to talk about what you’re actually putting on the table relationship-wise for her when you’re asking her to date you two exclusively.  This is where the term unicorn hunter can take a bit of a derisive tone because most unicorn hunters haven’t thought this part through.

You and your spouse came to be looking for a third after a hell of a lot of talking.  You discussed fears, or no saying “I love you” to the new person, or no sex without condoms, or she can only have sex with both of us at once, or…well, all kinds of stuff that could be reserved between the original two people.  The term for this is “couples privilege” and just like unicorn hunting it’s extremely common.  

So put yourself in the shoes of this unicorn you’ve got cornered, so don’t ever expect your needs to come first.  

You can see how this might be a deal that’s hard to close.  For the sake of argument though

You’re still going to need to learn how to handle jealousy.  You’re still going to feel left out sometimes.  You’re still going to need to work tirelessly on improving your communication and emotional awareness.  But now you’re trying to juggle and balance things that never, B-C, A-B-C.  These are all separate relationship, each has its own needs, each will grow at its own pace, each will have its own problems, and each will impact all the others.  

How do you handle it when you get in a fight with one of your partners and you feel like both of them team up against you?  What happens when despite the “rules” your other two partners fall in love and you just don’t feel that strongly about the new girl?  How are you feeling when you have to go out of town on business and the two of them spend the whole week alone together in your bed? What about if you just need a little space but new girl is *ALWAYS* over to see your spouse?  What if you fall in love with her and your spouse starts hinting at a veto because they feel left out?  In addition to all this

Now, it really is a suggestion of how to open your marriage to a third more successfully. The key to successfully opening your marriage to another person is to lose one specific concept.  It’s easier said than done, and most people don’t have the ability to take this lesson to heart without earning their lumps the hard way – but drop the idea of “equality” and especially that everything needs to be done in tandem. 

Things will never be equal, but trying to force the issue and keep things in tandem is a very difficult job for somebody who has already mastered the skills you have to learn.  It’s not where you want to be your first time at bat.  Instead of trying for the impossible “equal”, instead focus on a much more realistic “good” with an eye always on “even better” for everybody involved. 

I know it seems way scarier to just let your spouse go out there without you, so…get on that! The other big concept I hope you take away is that regardless of what model you choose for polyamory, the people you’re adding into your lives are not abstractions, they’re people who have needs and feelings that can be hurt.  I hope this post has inspired you to look at trying things differently than a couple of the most common pitfalls new people make.",,False,self,1374267788.0,t3_1imvod

She greets us, ""Oh! When we went to Benson we got this beautiful thing!"" she trots into the back room and gingerly opens a tissue-wrapped package. Hanging from a ribbon in her hands is a beautiful ceramic octopus christmas ornament, delicately painted in ice green and white and tipped at the tentacles with teeny tiny crystals. 

I gasp in wonder, and my hands are too dirty to touch the ornament. I  reach back, but too late - she thinks I have a grip on it, releases it, and the ornament and I fall down in a heap. I fall on the floor and it shatters.

She's nice about it

Boyfriend and I return to my place (split custody, I try - to no avail. It was a limited run, there are no more, only ten were made. I call the shop. I call the vendor. I call the distributor. I scour the intertubes. Nothing. Toy stores, general stores, hobby stores - nothing is right. 

So I decide to make one - but my carving skills and clay skills aren't up to the challenge of an eight-legged beast. I decide to order and paint one - and the first one I get in the mail is the size of a dinner plate

I get another one, glue on teeny swarovskis I bought at the craft store, put in a tiny gold eyehook, and hang it from green ribbon. I'll give it to her soon. It looks smashing. 

If I had just let it go, their past and future, and by extension my respect for those things. Neglecting to replace it by any means possible would be unforgiveable. 

I'm so glad I was able to remake the damn thing. Now I just need to figure out what to do with a floppy red rubber octopus the size of a plate.

I'll be taking the kids to a movie so they can have some privacy :) After he dropped her off back home, he came back all nervous because he thought he blew it, WAY over analyzed the whole evening, it's not going to be perfect (this is his first-first date in like 8 years) and it's all good.

About 4 years ago (prior to the semi-open-ish-ness

A few weeks later I received a phone call from her, knick-knacks and the like.)  So my wife and I went over to pick stuff up.  This was when she and my wife met.  They were friends almost instantly.  My wife asked her why she decided to call me about this and it was simply stated that it was because ""He was the first person that was nice to me when I got here.""  All was accepted.

A few weeks later, and we all dine together.  A couple of weeks later, I called her up, and said ""It's thanksgiving, your family is half a country away, come on over.""  A month after that it was ""Put some pants on, I'm on the way to pick you up.""

Then it became a twice a week thing.  It was to the point that my one year old recognized her and called her ""Aunt."" 

New years came and we all got liquored up and woke up on the folding couch together.  Nothing happened

We kept hanging out together for a few more months, and I told her at that time, that I would never keep her away from a good woman.

So, but I was experiencing compersion.  It felt right.

The company decided that I needed to be somewhere else for a year, and she stayed with my wife at least 5 days a week.  There were a couple of months that the only thing they were apart for was work.  They took care of each other.

She left today. She was giggly and squirming this morning when I kissed her goodbye. Both of us felt incredibly warm. I love the idea that they'll go out, smiling at her, attentively reaching out to her and reinforcing how hot she is. He'll be on his best behavior. Why? Because he knows if he does he'll see her again. His brain will awash in crazy-making molecules and just barely keeping his thoughts together. He knows at the end of the evening they'll ravaging each other, and exploring some pleasurable kink.   

She'll be dressed to the nines and absolutely digging how hot she looks and feels. This guy will be lavishing attention on her, showing this guy a good time for the evening, and she'll also know there's man that loves her that she can come home to, feel sane, safe and secure.  

Sidebar: while writing this she texted me: ""Walking ten blocks to meet up w/him at 5. Baby, a beautiful compassionate , loving man and I am SO happy with you and grateful to be your woman"". I texted her back saying I love her and wished her an awesome time. 

Tomorrow, and she'll probably get shy and maybe offer a few highlights. In the past I've brought home flowers, and I told her that this guy sounds great and I really appreciate how he seems like a good choice and that I'm just flat out glad for her. We always end up in bed feeling incredibly turned on and completely ravage each other.  

I dont think it will happen this time but in the past I've even felt a little jealousy or insecure, but when she's back we feel even tighter for having gone through that trial.

I was always a poly person. Well, skimmed a couple of books, and thought little more of the topic. But I was cynically poly: It wasn't that I truly thought that polyamory was ideal, it was just that I couldn't conceive that there would be any relationship that could contain all of my desires and aspirations and was skeptical that anyone who believed they had was delusional, at worst, or just plain settling. Being poly was just easier and allowed me to manage my expectations for relationships a little bit: I didn't need ""the one,"" or even the "".99, but I could find .95, a new partner. And, lets say she was still the "".9995."" We were alike enough to be compatible but different enough to… be compatible. Similar backgrounds


When we married, but each time, it felt like a minor bump along the path. Our secondary partners became fewer and farther between and were mostly out-of-state. Plus we had a kid and careers and were isolated a little geographically while we were in graduate school so we hardly had time for one another. Our polyamory turned more and more monogamish until I looked up one day, seven years into our marriage, and we were practically monogamous. And I liked it. I liked it a lot. And when my wife told me that she had a date coming up, I quietly freaked out. And when they fucked, I not-so-quietly lost it. I felt betrayed, though we often discussed rules and boundaries

My problem was that I'd thought my wife was cynically poly like me, because she knew, like I did, that right thing couldn't arrive, that the idea that the right thing could arrive was a myth. I knew that she was the right thing for me. It's not that other women didn't intrigue me or turn me on, but a part of me felt good and purposeful that there would be nobody else for me.  And I could still flirt and have strictly platonic friendships with those other women.


Well, in part, *because* we weren't weren't attached to controlling one another's intimate lives. She found something deeper and more profound, and no less romantic, in her vision of polyamory (which she'd thought I'd subscribed to as well). Likewise, she saw something cheap, patriarchal


We fought for a while. At first, lets try it your way"" and it was her turn to be resentful. We talked about a variety of compromises that, in hindsight, seem totally unreasonable (we actually seriously discussed alternating poly/monogamous by the year!) and made us more committed to our irreconcilable positions. It became a virus that infected every little thing about our relationship. Divorce was on the table again, and this time, it seemed final. Neither of us even seemed devastated, but we thought about the kid and decided to try on our marriage one last time. 


We talked to a marriage counselor. The counselor was, but she did help us to stop talking past one another. Through her, we got to a really refreshing conversation about compromises... and we discovered that compromise wouldn't work. My wife was willing to listen to me, willing to support me, willing to even sacrifice polyamory for me, but unwilling to change her beliefs. She's a philosopher, she found a philosophy in polyamory that she *believed* in. She was willing to hear the other side but she would always disagree (unless she encountered some great argument that I'm not inclined to make). 
But, sure, but if I have an operating philosophy it's that I think of myself as a more utilitarian: I do what benefits the most people. I do what **works**. So, I realized, if compromise wouldn't work, the only thing that *would* work would be to either change my premises or for us to get divorced. 


So I tried to change my premises and go back to square one on polyamory. I mean, even when I disagreed. That *worked* some. Also /r/polyamory helped (thanks guys!). But what worked most of all is that we ended the adversarial air that came to define our marriage. Oh, and I got a girlfriend -- a happily married, polyamorous engineer who uses engineering metaphors to explain her polyamory that sense to me in a way that my wife's Jacques Lacan quotations don't. That definitely helped. And wife has been the best listener and confidant and the best book group I could imagine. And, after a hard spell, it's actually been a lot of fun. Did you hear me? A LOT OF FUN! I still can't say that I'm poly by any particular principle other than ""do what works for what matters"" but that's a disagreement I'm happy to keep. 


So here I am, happily, happily, happily married. And even happily poly. She feels like ""we're back,"" I feel like we're something better than back. We're whole again. 
Thanks for reading.

Some background:  I'm a straight male, and he suggested that I go with him and his girlfriend back to his place and get high.  I did, we got high and then we played some chess.  I liked it a lot, and suggested I return soon.  

I started going over there more and more often, where the three of us would share a joint and talk about mankind, the point of life, and other shit you want to talk about while stoned and looking over a town.  I started get to get quite close to both of them.  This kept going for about two months until Thanksgiving break.

During break he let me know that his girlfriend (my friend at this point) had posted on GW.  I was confused and stupidly suspected nothing of it.  After we got back, but happy to talk about it with her.  When we got home after the walk I finally pieced it together that she wanted to have sex with me.  I said I was uncomfortable with a threesome, so me and her went upstairs and had AMAZING sex.  I wont go into specifics, but damn was it good.  We spent the next three weeks fucking like rabbits, and I eventually was ok with having a threesome, so the sex started getting better.  She posted one of our escapades on GW, and mentioned we are three.  One of the commentors posted a link to r/poly.  This was the first time I had heard of polyamory outside of cult polygamy.

At this point I was a FWB.  We talked about having feelings for each other

The amazing news though, and how much we miss each other.  With some awkward conversation dancing I mentioned r/poly.  This spurred us into our first three-way conversation about us.

She was very nervous (as always) about such a different situation.  But the more we talked the more we realized that just because we were calling it FWB didn't make it so.  The three of us had feelings for each other.  So we decided that we want to take it seriously

Last Friday, but she wants the marriage to stay together, but she also wants my permission to have sex with other women.  She confessed to flirting with one other woman at the Y and that they fondled each other's boobs in the showers, but said they went no further than that.  This attraction and groping came out of nowhere, she says.

In the spirit of full disclosure, and less than zero interest in fucking anyone other than my wife.  At the same time, though, if this is what she really needs, then maybe I should let her sleep around, even if we have to get separated or divorced later.

So on Saturday we made an appointment with a marriage counsellor, probably), but I still have to admit I said yes and told her to go for it.

Which she did.

The very same day.

And she spent the night.

I didn't even know she had the Y woman's phone number, repetitious task sometimes helps me cope with big revelations like, y'know, this).  She even called me, panting in that ""I just had the most amazing sex ever!"" way, to tell me she wouldn't be home for dinner, and I could hear the other woman giggling next to (behind? on top of? underneath? wrapped around?) her, ""gottagoloveyoubye"" and hung up as they went on to round 2 or 3 or fuck if I know how many rounds it was.

My wife came home around 1:00 pm Sunday.  She came onto me and it looked like things were about to get hot and bothered, etc.  killed my erection stone-dead and left me unable to maintain another one.  I offered to get her off some other way, but she declined and said ""You suck."" (In fairness, I think she was joking with ""you suck,"" she's done it before, but it didn't make me feel any better this time.)

So

Thanks in advance.

   We had a long discussion about people and relationships and a previous relationship that I had with a mono guy that I fell for almost 2 years ago. Which she knew about but didn't approve of because 1)Her father (my husband) didn't approve of the relationship. And 2) His motives were actually to 'steal me away' from my husband. 
 
 She also asked me if I thought my boyfriend would want to meet all of them, my other daughter and her family). I told her, I had never specifically asked him that but I can't see why not.

  Now I just need to figure out how to tell her sister. Ideally

When we first started dating back in 2009 Primary was exclusive and strictly monogamous. I explained to him that I'm a free love kinda guy and would like to branch out and try things. Naturally Primary was not very pleased with this but we talked about it. I agreed to reign in my horses and he agreed to open up a little when he's ready.

So a year goes by and we look like any other mono couple

Then he goes to visit family but along the way meets a friend from the Internet and they wanted to play. I told him it was fine because I really am not worried about him leaving me for a fling. He had fun on his own and realised that I could do the same and still love him. Next thing I know I have full permission to play with whomever I want and whenever I want

Now a few weekends ago he goes to visit family again in the neighbouring city and finds another hookup for the weekend
And Primary and I are still going very strong.

Primary told me that he learnt that he can have feelings for someone without diminishing the feelings for another. I'm so happy for him.

Now Primary's crush is coming to visit us for the weekend of the 22nd. Crush is really nervous and has no idea what to make of me because he's never encountered polyamory before

Today I told Primary he should send a Valentines message to Crush

I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment with input. My head is a little clearer now. Sorry for the panic

-------------------
A little backstory: My fiance' and I have been poly since the very beginning of our relationship. After a year or so of dating we moved in together and became active in our local kink community. At one of the munches we met with my girlfriend and her husband. They were somewhat new to practicing the BDSM lifestyle. He was the Dom

The male half of this relationship, and D- having pursued S for years, wanted to keep her around and so became the UBER DOM.

So

Here's where the issue comes in.

Today, I was kind of wanting sex but she was tired and not wanting it. But I payed attention to my instincts and went over to her and mounted her and really gave it to her.""

Throughout the course of their relationship I suspected he was forcing her to do a lot of things she didn't like to do and was not consenting to. I know with the nature of BDSM, it would turn her on. I asked her if it turned her on. She said no. He insisted it did anyway.

He has also come out with such gems as ""Oh, but tells me when he will be doing so and assumes everyone is okay with it. We've asked him not to do that. He does it anyway.

Eep, but...I'm concerned for her. He rubs me the wrong way and she seems to be really not that into what he wants.

So

So

During the whole discussion she had been having a hard time talking about how she honestly felt with him. She struggled with each answer when gently asked if she was okay with what he was suggesting I do to her. Then

I can't describe it. I just knew that I shouldn't push her any more on it in front of him. I don't want to assume she was in a rape-feeling situation based on a look

I asked her, if she loved him, if she was comfortable, and she answered yes. But what he said, and the way she looked at that moment..I'm very, very concerned for her. I didn't tell him it was wrong, which I feel horrible about. She's probably at home right now going through something similar. I think I was scared if I had said something I would have driven him to telling her she should end our relationship and that would have put her in an unsafe situation with no lifelines.

My fiance' is currently at work. I've texted him a couple times. I want to call him

I want to suggest she stay with us for a few days

I feel very much at a loss of what to do here. He reads all of her messages so I can't message her and he always comes over with her so it's very hard to get her alone. If I can manage to arrange it it will probably be a few weeks before that happens. I'm going to try to see if I can figure out something for tomorrow but I don't know how well it will work. I'm also supposed to visit their home on the 9th but I really do not trust him at the moment and really do not want to be around him alone.

I feel like I need to do something but I don't know what.",self,t5_2qu5n,1364961778.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1bk3mh/i_suspect_my_girlfriend_has_been_raped_by_her/
1356791863.0,15miep,"Had a kinda rough night. Still struggling, but I came out pretty well.",ColonelGraff,82,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/15miep/had_a_kinda_rough_night_still_struggling_but_i/, and it never bothered me when they hung out. Once she started dating him

I have, I've gotten turned down more often than not. At the same time, whenever they hang out together, they have fooled around and she's really enjoyed it. I've told my wife how I've been feeling, and that I'm grappling with it. There's no clear answer, but we're working on it, and 

So cue last night. Last night was the first time they went out with the intent of having sex. They spent all day together, and just generally in a bad mood.  And then, when she left, I was alone. As I'm sure many here have experienced, the first time your SO leaves to have sex with someone, it's a big feeling. We've had threesomes before, and we have talked about them having sex for a while, that's what got me pushed into a very contemplative space.

So I asked myself some questions.

Q: Why am I OK with this?  
A: Because it makes her happy
Q: Then why am I feeling so shitty?  
A: Because you don't get to be there  
Q: But you still don't really feel sexy
A: That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.  
Q: So why don't you feel sexy?  

This was sort of the watershed moment for me. I don't feel sexy lately because of me. Sure, we're trying to buy a new house and my wife's car just broke down, the girl I'd like to date hasn't responded to a couple date ideas (and may simply not be interested), and the girl I used to fool around with started dating someone and I told her she needed to put us on hold as a result.

So I realized several things. I have been using sex as a proxy for feeling sexy and good about myself. While I still am a little jealous of all the time they get to spend together, and that's not something to worry about. I just had this moment of clarity that made me happy. I texted my wife and apologized for being off earlier and told her to have a great time.

So I walked out of a sports bar with chicken wings in tow and a big smile on my face, hung out with a good friend who's in town, and got to bed at a reasonable hour. While there's obviously still some stuff that I have to deal with (with me and probably with the whole group), I feel a lot better about where I am than I did 24 hours ago.

I know this has been long and rambling

--------
UPDATE: When my wife got home, how the evening went, how the sex went, everything. And it was great. Thanks for all the support, everyone. I'm sure this won't be the last time I struggle or don't feel great about everything in the entire universe, and it's good to know that there are supportive people here.",,self,,

**Some background:** He is 31, living in a major city, making good money and not responsible to anyone but ourselves. We live separately - he has a very nice, large downtown apartment that could easily accommodate both of us, but has resisted move-in talks. I live with 2 roommates.

We opened our relationship 2 years ago after many months of talking and fantasizing.

**Our poly experience:** As soon as we opened up our relationship, but 90% of my romance is with my boyfriend and my two ""lovers"".

My boyfriend's luck was different. I think he's very attractive and charming, the women bolted. After 11 months of poly with him not having had sex with anyone besides me, it was clear that there was a lot of frustration and resentment building up, and it was hurting our relationship.

I suggested that we stop being open for a while, and I couldn't really go back to monogamy. I told him that and though he hid it well, I knew it caused him a lot of pain (though I don't know the precise cause of it, because he has always said he wants to be open). He agreed to give opening up another whirl. I went back to my steady lovers and he continued to have failed dates.

Then about 6 months ago, he quickly slept with 3 more women in the next month. I was happy for him, but I knew something was fishy, and I asked him what had changed. He said that he had been reading dating advice from the web and reddit, and it was helping. I took him at his word and let it pass, though I had an uncomfortable feeling about it. I was also generally uncomfortable with how many women he suddenly seemed be having ongoing sexual relationships with, but I didn't want to steal his moment in the sun.

A month ago, one of my FWBs and myself were having dinner. As the woman and I were casually chatting in the kitchen, it quickly became apparent that she had no idea the guy she was with was already in a committed relationship. She was talking about what a catch he was, and how she can't believe a guy like him is single in this city.

Later that night, educated, ""soft"" - only work on women that are ready to settle down. And after honesty about his true situation didn't work for him for over a year, he'd decided that not being upfront about his status is the way to go. He's leading these women on, none of whom appear to be the slightest bit poly-minded, with a vague mirage of being a good, normal man who is looking for the right girl to settle down with.

This is something that deeply offends me. For one thing, I  fear the possibility that he is going to start believing his version of reality - with each woman, he seems to be trying out back-up plans to our relationship, and if the right woman comes along, I get the feeling that he will eject out of our relationship into her arms.

I want him to stop doing this, which I very definitely want. Is it fair to ask him to be honest to the women he sees, even if it means he will get a lot less (perhaps no) sex with women he finds attractive?

Here's what I wrote in the box for feedback at the end.

-----

I think significant portions of this survey were very poorly designed or worded, or practices.  Since I know a good number of other people whose views or practices are similar to mine, I think you're editing us entirely out of the field of your survey; there's no way we can get across through answering these questions.

You narrowly focused on well-defined formal relationships with specific start dates and durations, and partners, and a social network of involvements in which the state of these connections can sometimes be formalized but in many other cases is nebulous and fluctuates over time.  If you were to substitute ""friend"" for ""partner"" in some of your questions you might begin to see how many of them seem to me.  ""Exactly how many friendships are you in at this moment?""  ""Okay, now pick one of those friends: exactly how many months since this friendship began?""  ""How well has it met your initial expectations?""

Some specific examples of problematic questions (some of which relate to my general complaint above

1\. ""Please indicate whether you consider [X] to be a primary partner.""
Only two answers were available, so I had to pick that I consider her ""my partner"" but not primary.  Umm, ""my partner?""  No.  Maybe if you said ""a partner"" that would be accurate, though on the edge.

2\. ""how long have you been questioning whether monogamy is right?""

You presume that I'm questioning.  I'm not questioning.  Also, you'll have to explain further.  Either this question is too vague to answer, or it is not applicable.

3\. ""How long have you been dating ZA?""  Should I say 5 years to begin with what in hindsight was our first date?  But what about the year when we had no contact at all?  Or the almost-year when she was monogamous with someone else and we saw each other frequently and our friendship continued intensifying but we couldn't even kiss?  Or the fact that our non-dating involvement in the past two years has had a very very different quality from the previous 3 years?  And keep in mind that almost-year of her monogamy with someone else was in these past two years.  No answer to that question would be true; the question itself assumes a false premise.

4\. ""Who do you think is more naturally inclined (such as biologically wired or has a genetic predisposition)  to engage in consensual non-monogamy"" men or women?

You require that I pick an answer somewhere on a continuum between men and women; the middle answer was 50/50.  What if my actual answer is that I am confident that we do not know whether men or women have a genetic predisposition for this

5\. ""We would like to know if you have ever seen a therapist, and if so, in what capacity.  Please describe your prior experience with therapy.""

Because the first choice was ""I have never sought counseling or psychotherapy"" I assume you are limiting this question to my adult life, but obviously it wasn't me who ""sought counseling"" (nor did I object).


Edit: Oops, so each time I included a blank line in an item, it started my numbering at 1 again.  Sorry!  Fixed with some backslashes now.

Edit 2: Something I left in comments on an earlier question rather than in my final feedback, among other things, that you be in more than one romantic relationship.  That implies that if you're in a committed relationship and also have a regular but casual non-romantic friend with benefits, what you're doing isn't poly.  It implies that if you're in two poly relationships and one of those breaks up, your other relationship just ceased to be poly.  Quite absurd.  I don't know if they meant it that way but I called them on it.  ""Polyamory"" is more or less synonymous with what they define as ""non-monogamy"", and it bugs me when people try to narrow it down and point at some non-monogamous relationship practice and say ""that's not poly!"".

The girl bought my wife drinks, even won a silent auction of a Betty page book for her! (strange i know, but my wife ADORES Betty page).  Anyway later in the night, i got the call to come pick them up, so he left and I went to pick them up  When i got there, the girl took really good care of her.

I brought them both back to our house, she was in a transparent shirt and underwear, which, for me, was a new experience since my wife has been the only person i have been with in the last 8 years, but it was strangely not any sort of big deal, i was just happy she was so comfortable around me to be vulnerable.  The girl asked me about boundaries and i told her that we are still exploring that
Shortly after that
We got up, kissed and watched cartoons until almost 7pm that day until we had to take her home.  
There was no sex, i dont want to say ""love"" because we just met her, so im not sure what to use but just feeling a whole lot of something, was amazing.     

Anyway after we took her home my wife and I talked about everything we experienced and were both elated!  Neither of us felt any sort of jealousy
So for a first shot, not sexually but intimately and it was like she was part of ""us"".  I realise we just got to know her that evening but it was all very comfortable since everything was out on the table and open.

I've invited two girls to brunch and dinner on Saturday who are very important to me. I wanted to give you some context about them

Over the course of the past year, I found myself seeing a few girls regularly enough, and for long enough, that it felt like they weren't so ""casual"" anymore. Everyone knew I was dating other people, but only one knew who they were specifically, by name. Which was actually really nice. It started to really bother me not being fully honest with these girls I was hanging out with so much. By skipping over fun stories I might have just because I was with another girl, felt like I was lying

I wasn't ready for a monogamous girlfriend yet though. There is something really wonderful about being able to build a relationship with more than one person. You don't need her to have EVERY SINGLE quality you think you are looking for in a partner. If one hates football for example, and each relationship is unique. Because I was seeing a few girls, my relationship with each of them was actually better and stronger than they would have been if I was looking for ""the one"" or something.

So I decided to open up to everyone about everything. My new policy was total honesty, went to concerts with a couple of them together.

I later discovered what I was doing is called polyamory

So I've been doing this for a while now. It has made me a better and more confident person, or any of these ""normal"" relationship problems, and I feel… enlightened. I have gone from not being so sure about how to find and be in a relationship, to feeling bad for those who don't get it.

I'm still great friends with two of the girls I was seeing over the summer, and will be joining us for brunch (and probably some of the day). After the summer I began to meet more people who were also polyamorous, some who have been doing it for as long as 12+ years! One of the girls I met is ~~[OMITTED]~~. She has been in an open relationship with her primary boyfriend for a couple years. We fell in love too. She is my other girlfriend, and will be joining us for dinner.

You might think having two girlfriends would divide the attention and energy I'm able to put into each in half

- It's not about ""keeping score"" with your partner.
- It's not harder for poly guys to get dates than poly women - it's just harder for men to get dates
- If there's no love involved
- Women do approach men. Just because they aren't approaching you doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
- The majority of ""rules"" tend to be built to protect the original couple
- Forcing your relationships into a hierarchy is stupid and insulting. Just love people, and talk about issues as they come up.
- No one on the internet can fix your relationship for you. Go talk to your partner(s). Just communicate and be honest. And don't forget to LISTEN more than you talk.

This is one thing I've always found extremely disturbing... the treatment of cheaters as unquestionably wrong, and the cheated on as unquestionably noble and righteous, so much so that they get a free pass to do bad things / be assholes.

I get that cheating is wrong in a monogamous relationship, etc.  But the stigma attached to cheating can be unlike anything else in society, even real crimes with actually inherently harmful outcomes.  And some of the comments can be downright *disturbing.*

The angels rounded up the souls of all of the dark wizards who had turned to sacrificing people and imprisoned them in a dark mansion on the astral plane.  Every thousand years

Finally,000th anniversary of the destruction of Atlantis, the Archangel Michael destroyed the souls of all those dark wizards who had refused to repent and purged them from reality.  Including your soulmate, so now you are all alone.

I accept that people have varying degrees of possessiveness and I don't think that's a bad thing. I just try not to compare relationships because to me a relationship is a list of things I am comfortable with doing with a person. It's just always slightly frustrating when I can't convey what I'm (not) feeling when talking to someone who does prefer fidelity. I can still relate though as I've felt jealousy over smaller things. Only simpler things like toys when I was a child.

So my fiancé has just met with

* it means he'll probably get new ideas for things to do during sexy times and keep our night time activities fresh and alive.

*  I might get some great porn because my man is in it. He occasionally takes videos with his phone.

* They had so much fun the new guy wants to meet me

What helps fiancé with jealousy;

* We call each other every day and often chat for about an hour. Can get expensive but so far we haven't been apart very long so it's worth it.

* When I return the first thing we do is bone and cuddle for ages. (His request. I ain't even mad.)

* Us getting engaged boosted his confidence in us a lot. It means something to him and he means the same to me so it made sense to accept. Now I'm not saying ""Want to play the field? Propose!"" but what may be a good idea is to be patient and let the relationship develop more and have deeper meaning before approaching the topic again.

* When I want to do things with others I ask him first. I let him know I want to and find out how he feels. If he isn't happy at first we would wait a while for emotions to calm. Later I would encourage him to try the activity for himself. He often found he enjoyed it and understood why I wanted to so now we both freely do many things that were once uncomfortable.

* I have explicitly told him that if he's ever uncomfortable with anything I'm doing I will stop and we can talk and similarly I will let him know if I'm not happy with something. I have also made sure he knows that we can stop advancing any time as I am already happy and would rather keep things the way they are rather than lose him.

What I really recommend to all parties concerned is to be patient with each other and talk. We've taken 4 years and we've only just started exploring fuck buddy territory. It's going to be a while still before the topic of dating is even on the horizon.

* peter and i are at super different stages in our lives, but children are surprisingly hard on a marriage.  the relationship with peter, on the other hand....lacks all of this.  there is no way ""father caring for toddler with full time job, mortgage payment and house to help manage"" is going to be able to compete with peter, the bachelor who has to decide if he's gaming, going out to the bar with friends, hitting the gym or sleeping in.

* i feel like i'm being placated.  i particularly dislike her offer to open things up for me; i don't want that.  if anything, truly make this concession to me (she's always been a little possessive, although not overtly so).
* she claims she can completely separate the two relationships, chats with him until wee hours of the morning, and has already visited him for a week twice in the last six months.  the idea that she could somehow make that level of relationship invisible to me seems like wishful thinking. 
* then, but i'm her husband and she'll always be with me.""  i've always been super trusting of her (part of the reason she has this relationship with peter was because i really don't like being possessive, want her to have friends, etc.), and i feel like that trust has been completely violated.  i dislike the idea of her being physically intimate with other men.

They are interacting with each other often after I am sleep or after I am at work.  I have a very different work schedule than they do.

We decided because (insert huge wall of text here) that we would be poly.  We are both in full agreement about this and the reason is very healthy.

Jealousy still occurs.  I will not lie.  We both still feel it.  It is an ancient emotion hardwired into the human brain.  

But it's not too difficult to rationalize my way out of that feeling.  I made a decision based upon my philosophy of life. I feel the jealousy and acknowledge it for what it is.  It is fear of loss.  It is fear that he will find someone who he knows is better than I am and that he will abandon me in favor of this person.  I fear losing him and the stability he represents.

But it's important to keep in mind a few things:

1) My goal in life is to be as happy as I can be. (this is a selfish goal)

2) I am happiest when I am with my love

3) Who am I to limit the happiness of my love? I am only empowered to control my own life.  He is still a free entity.  He must be allowed to pursue whatever pursuits that give him joy. I love to see him joyful...it gives me joy.

4) If he finds happiness in the arms of another man then I must embrace this.  He finds a lot of love and security in my arms

5) I do not wish to lose him, lose him to someone that he thinks will make him happiest.  I would hope that he could pursue both relationships simultaneously, which I think would be best for all of us...but there is a chance that this will not happen.  I must accept this and honor his agency.  He is free to come and go as he pleases.  I would be very sad, even emotionally destroyed for a time.  I would know, however, that my love was happy. Which would give me some joy.

6) I would rather be single than in a relationship with a person who did not want to be in a relationship with me any longer. 

This sounds like an argument for an open relationship.  But we are actively pursuing a 3rd...And we must keep jealousy in mind when we find this person.  Will he pay more attention to one or the other of us? How do we react to this? Will he attempt to separate us and play us against one another? How do we react to this?  If jealousy is dealt with rationally

1373432006.0,1hzla8,The best piece of advice to people new to poly that I wish someone had given me.,Chessiecat,68,11,14,"Treat it like it's your first relationship and be *gentle* with yourself.  

Getting into a poly relationship for the first time is a strange

When you were a teenager

I don't know any of these people

First relationships are a time to make a lot of mistakes.  How calm you can be while doing that is what will determine how the relationship ends up, two arms, two legs, still alive...how can I respond to this situation in a way that makes things better?'.

Sometimes there won't be a way.  You end the relationship when that happens if you're healthy. (Sometimes you don't. Some people can get by for years on hating each other.  My parents sure did.) 

The point is that, then you'll be more inclined to forgive mistakes.  The first time your partner sleeps with someone else might be scary.  If you're gentle with yourself, you can say 'I'll get some ice-cream and when they get home, I'll give them a biiig hug!' or 'I'll ask them to talk to me tomorrow, after they've had a good night's sleep'.  

Successful relationships are a skill.  Start from the idea that you and your partner know nothing.  It might not be true, you'll be more inclined to forgive the mistakes of a beginner.  This kindness will give you the time necessary to build your connections with care and grace.  ",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,

She also feels a strong connection with me, I agreed. But, I am entering into uncharted waters. So, I searched for a community where I can share my thoughts and learn more about the way in which other poly people go about relationships. I understand that it is always different. But, it helps for me to see what issues come up and how people deal with them. It's also nice to see all the loving posts by people who are happy in their current poly relationships.

My girlfriend has two OSOs, and his wife and her OSO are also friends of mine. She says that she wants me to explore the possibility of having an OSO of my own, but I don't feel comfortable with that right now. I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable with it. She also wants to know if I am willing to have threesomes with she and other girls. I don't know if this is something which I will be comfortable with either. I'm a rare dude for whom the fantasy of a threesome doesn't do much. But, she is wonderful and patient and loving and she doesn't push any of these things.

I am generally a long-term relationship kinda guy. And, I am approaching this with an open heart and the intent to learn. Whether or not this relationship works out (I really hope it does), I hope to gain a better understanding of myself and my expectations within a relationship, and maybe even conquer some of my jealousy demons.

UPDATE: Feb 21 12:11pm

My night:

I went home per usual after work, relaxed. I found that I was waiting for something before going to bed, and realized that it was just me (I was a little high). So much silence. We have been married for 3 years come May, and have only spent 2 nights away from each other in that time. I'm not sure if this makes 3 times or 2 times. I woke up to find that I was alone. We decided to communicate minimally via text message for now while we're out with our boyfriend girlfriends, but we willingly track each other's phones (kind of creepy at first, but extremely practical—especially if you don't have secrets anyway, but would just like to make sure your SO is not in the river). It also helps for times where the other may take some time to respond, ""I hope she's okay

We only have one car, had a lovely solitary morning. Not something I want every day, but the novelty was quite nice. I observed that she was at her boyfriend's until 11am, at which point I texted:

""Alive?""

She responded:

""So alive. I mean what.""

Then I said:

""Good. That's all. :)""

That's all I know right now

24, and very innately poly/nonmonogamous. I've been in only open relationships and poly relationships ever since I started dating at 18. At best, the people I dated honestly, truly supported what I did with or felt for other people, but had no desire to be with other people themselves. At worst they, deep down, wanted to be monogamous but put up with being open because they wanted to be with me.

The latter was especially evident in my last relationship. She knew how I am from the beginning and thought she could and would be okay with it, and how much she had to work to be okay with it—because that would mean acknowledging our relationship fundamentally couldn't work. So she insisted on lots of rules (veto power which she did use, no sex/hooking up with other people while she was gone/out of town, etc) and would not generally respond positively when I told her I had a crush on someone, or was attracted to someone, or wanted to sleep with them. There were issues with how I introduced my other partners/lovers to her, with how I acted with her when they were around. There were also some times that were better than others, that deep pit-of-the-stomach reluctance to go to your partner with things you really should and ought to be able to discuss with them

I encouraged her crushes on other people, so it seemed double-y doable). She would say ""maybe sometime"" but clearly wasn't interested. We tried to make it work for a long time, but eventually I just couldn't do it anymore.

Around the time that relationship officially ended, who is as open/poly as I am. The contrast of finally dating someone who is actually poly/open blows my mind. We can talk about everything fearlessly. When he's out of town, he encourages me to 'flirt and more' (his words) with other people. I had sex a couple times with a close, mutual friend of ours who we both adore, and he couldn't have been more supportive of it. We had an incredibly hot foursome with another couple, friends of ours. And through all this our relationship has only gotten stronger and stronger. We both are open to the entire spectrum—casual sex with other people; sex together, sex apart; sex with friends (this seems to be the most common thing in my personal experience—extra-relationship sex with people I care about, but not in a defined relationship or even truly romantic sense); relationships with other people together or separately. We are madly in love and incredibly happy.

I regularly see people on here posting about a mono/poly mismatch. I do think it can work, and at some point you need to ask if it's worth it. Especially when the alternative is *so* incredible.

1346354739.0,z3cv0,Polyeros v. polyamory ,johncro13,66,10,42,"A few days ago

Not long ago I had a sexual encounter with both my then-girlfriend and wife at the same time, it was cool. At a later date, when it had been decided that I was going to join the girlfriend and her boyfriend, I found myself uncomfortable and a little pressured, so I stopped, and although he didn't mind, she was shockingly upset. I discovered that she didn't consider us poly unless we all slept together. Somehow I was made to feel that I wasn't poly. I was just ""open."" And that was wrong! Being ""open"" should not have a negative connotation. It felt like being called a ""swinger"" and, there is nothing wrong with that, and STILL maintain that I'm poly. 

The part where my little editorial went awry is when I tried to make another point. That's what I want to address here. 

Just having sex with more than one person doesn't make you poly. I went so far as to say that a person who ONLY has sex with a lot of people
I'm sorry to have made that sweeping judgement. The discussion that followed was about promiscuity and the immediate negative connotation that it has on our society

Promiscuity is, or sex with multiple partners. Polyeros is not the same thing as polyamory, multiple loves. The difference between polyamory and polyeros is the difference between love and sex. You can have love without sex and can also have sex without love.

It is possible to be polyamorous and abstinent. There are people who don't have sex. That doesn't mean they are loveless
On the opposite side, or expressing love. The vast majority of people are capable safe sane casual sexual experiences! Sex is great and having it with multiple people can be fantastic! There is a difference, however between having sex without love and openness and being incapable of sex with it. Being unable to love is a symptom of being a sociopath. Being a sociopath, from my experience, is synonymous with being a douche. I am not saying that polyeros is a bad thing! Being a dick is. 

My current girlfriend was seeing a guy who seemed interested in polyamory. We discovered quickly that it was because he just wanted to have a lot of sex with a lot of people, the one that composed ""their song."" He broke up with her via text message. That guy? That's a douche. That's someone who confuses polyeros and polyamory. And that story is far too common. 

But let's don't confuse it. Without love polyeros isn't polyamory. That's the point I'm trying to make. 

Society at large assumes that in polyamory, symptoms of brainwashing from deviant sexual behavior. I posit that the assumption comes, partially, because people have difficulty understanding how sex and love are two different things, completely sex-driven a-holes are far too prevalent, and completely sex-driven genuinely nice people are far too rare.

It's okay to have a partner you don't love. It's fine to have lots of them

I went out on a date with a great guy last night. We hit it off intellectually, and he and his wife have both had experience with open relationships in the past. All great so far.

Then the giant red flag came out on the field: he and his wife have a rule. Either she has to be in the same house while he has sex (and then she doesn't get a say in whether or not he HAS that sex), he has to contact her and ask for permission to have sex with his partner. Every time, if she's not around. And she can say no. 

I have a big fucking problem with this. I want me and my partner to be in control of our sex life

But I also haven't met his wife yet. If she's a cool, I would like to look her in the eyes and ask, as nicely as I can, why her desire to control her husband's dick is more important than my desire to control my own sex life. I want a serious answer, here, because I can't think of a reason that doesn't stem from insecurity/control issues, but maybe there is one. 

I also thought I might be more ok with it if he does the whole 'can I' song and dance before we ever go out on the date

After spending some time on polyamory.com, while /r/polyamory definitely seems more...hmmm...positive? Anyways, I wanted to share my positive story with you guys. :)

Pretty exactly one year ago, so I wasn't really shocked. In short summary, I told her it was okay and she could ask if he wanted to be her boyfriend. There started a long and at times quite painfull journey for me, personally, and possibly even more so for my partner (and her boyfriend too). I really wanted to be okay with this, but it was like suddenly finding yourself at 1000 meters under the surface, wanting to be okay with breathing water instead of air. :-D I had so many personal issues to deal with, so much insecurity...it's amazing how much you can find if you start digging in yourself

Some flaws in our relationship became very obvious, she kinda already knew) we had drifted apart the last few years, due to all kinds of stuff happening around us. In a short period of time last year, we made some big changes which have baffled our friends. 6 years ago, at 30, we had built this huge house in the countryside, and we were considered successful by many. Selling that soul-draining house is the best decision we ever made last year. :) Focusing on what is good and right for us, and I feel so much happier and healthier...just wow! :) I love my partner more than ever
They did a tiny get-away at a spa-resorta few days ago, I would probably not say this, but I would not change this for anything. What it has given me of personal development, the demons I have managed to find and partly control...it's just...amazing. Sure, time and resources are always sought after, but it's getting easier and easier to deal with. 
I love my partner so much and I feel so loved by her, but things are getting better and will hopefully just keep on moving ahead. The biggest changes have not been directly related to her new relationship, but to our existing one, and our surroundings. Making space to breathe and expand is *so* essential!  
I now feel more alive and loved and happy than I have for years! 
It's funny how much three little words can change things.... ""I love him"" ;-)

Backstory:

The wife and I are virtually the same age, very communicative. It creeps some of our friends out that she and I almost never argue. We are cartoonists, novelists, and artists, of some minor success.

She has a BF, but while he's lived here, it's been great. I totally approve of him, and his moving out, although necessary, will be bittersweet. (He's moving 10 minutes away, so no worries there.)

My own romantic past has been ups and downs

Got back in touch with a friend from yesteryear who used to be a FWB with me. We haven't hung out on a regular basis since 1999. Went on a date, and we had a second date on Friday that, again, resulted in an overnight stay. She's a single mother now, and we were both stunned during discussions that we both thought of each other as prime dating material back then, but each of us was too intimidated to pursue it. There was a mutual thought that the other was out of our league, which we're now laughing at. She thought I was too hot, too smart to date a fuckhead like me. Now we're older, with a need for romance. We're taking it slowly. We're both parents now

I drove back to my wife Saturday morning with the taste of my lover still on my lips. If I close my eyes

That said, and got to bed sometime around dawn. We woke at 1 pm today, and had a really gorgeous simultaneous orgasm bout of wake-up sex.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.  I decided to talk to my partner, and I agreed.  It turns out that his other partner has been going through a lot lately.  She has been having trouble with anxiety and depression, which I had no idea about.  I suffer from depression as well, so I'm kind of mad at myself for not picking up on this.  It certainly explains why she never goes out and does anything, and wants her boyfriend around constantly.  He told me that he didn't want to share this with me without her permission, which I respect.  He talked to her about letting me in on all of this, and she agreed that I deserved to know

She has decided to see a therapist, it's still going to be hard to deal with all this, but I'm glad that everything is out in the open now.  She also knows how I feel about not getting the time I need, so hopefully this will be something that we can actively work on in the future.  I think this has also taught the three of us that we really need to work on our communication skills.

* Despite a large social group of common friends (most of who fucked each other at some point
* Chatting with her husband (also a mutual friend) and he questioned how I wasn't jealous having an open relationship.
* While talking
* From anecdotal evidence

My primary doesn't think she's being deceitful. After months of craving

Each time I voice my concerns he reacts defensively. When I softly implored with her

So I'm looking for some feedback

Do you think I'm pulling this conclusion out of thin air? How can I express myself to someone caught up in new relationship glow? 

I feel so guilty being (a probable) accomplice in a cheating marriage. 

**TL;DR** Primary has new partner who seems to be cheating on her husband. Wracked with guilt.

The title is dramatic

I’m pretty close to 50 years old

One thing I’ve learned, oil. This does not make drama good.. I’ve had my share of dramatic moments. I’ve had partners die from accidents, attempt to commit suicide multiple times, and, in the most recent case, just threaten suicide in an attempt to manipulate. (As much as every suicide threat should be taken seriously, we ended the relationship that night and made sure there was someone there for her. She was not suicidal and I suspect the relationship was what was making her unhappy.)

I have some general observations about poly (and drama). I think they are pretty important:

* Drama hinders communications. The three most important things in poly are Communicate, emoting has a funny way of shutting off the ears (not to mention abstract thought that might find a solution).
* If you are poly and insist on being involved with mono people
* If you think you can proselytize the poly lifestyle by  “turning” mono folk poly
* Are you mono? Did your partner just come out as poly? My condolences
* Trying poly and your partner wants to close the relationship (cutting off the secondaries)? Figuring out if you’re poly is hard. Keep it closed until you’re certain they are certain. Otherwise...
* Did your primary poly partner declare they want to be mono with you? Again
* Having problems with jealousy? Most of us do. Think about this: If you cannot stomach equality and allow your partners the same privileges then you might want to reconsider whether you are poly. (You might just be more interested in Dominance/Submission fantasies -- that’s okay
* Just have a breakup? You poor thing! I suspect poly folks go through a lot more relationships than monogamous ones -- that means you can experience far more of them in the poly lifestyle. If this is a problem for you
* If you start a post with “My husband/wife wants to open the relationship.” The answer is, who pledged their entire future life to you, would like to change the terms of what was supposed to be a permanent relationship. This is almost never (IME) a good thing.
* Do something you shouldn’t have with someone you shouldn’t have? Yes
* Does your partner want to try poly? It really could be that they are bored of you and want to start a new relationship before they boot you to the curb. They might not be poly; they might be a confused and bored serial monogamist instead.

Folks

What it boils down to is this: If you cannot rationally talk about a problem, then you might want to consider the legitimacy of your problem.

Some therapists take good money to listen to people’s problems without solving them. If you just need to complain

Update: As many people have pointed out, I stand by all of this. But, as with everything else, YMMV.

My husband has had a long time female friend, my husband, and I) should spend more time together. She thought that we really had our life together and that they could benefit from having such mature and stable friends. When my husband told me this, my response was that while I was flattered I was pretty certain that they were the crux of their drama. Getting closer to them would only drag their drama into our life.

Over the past year Jane and my husband have hung out some

I've spent the last few months working on me and not dating. Recently I found someone that seems nice. My husband told Jane that this girl was interested in dating me

I wasn't too terribly impressed. I was getting a pretty sizable red flag that if I did choose to date her I could look forward to flaky scheduling and third party communication. She made plans to come to our house Thursday. I cleaned
I made a FB post about enjoying my (new) plans for the night and she posted that she was sorry for canceling but she was looking forward to seeing me the next day. 
This was the first direct conversation that I'd had with her in over six months. I deleted her comments because they didn't pertain to the original post. Messaged her that I had done so and that I was unaware of any plans she'd made to see me. I told her she should contact me in some form other than publicly on FB to figure it out. 

She responded to my message. She clarified that she'd told my husband upon canceling the night before that she'd swing by after work for a very quick visit. We chatted a bit and left it at that. 

Two hours after the time she said she got off work I messaged her saying that I was done waiting around and not terribly happy. I put my phone on the charger and proceeded to walk away from the issue for some quiet time. About an hour later she showed up at our house with her husband in tow after texting my husband apologies

At 2:33 in the morning I woke up to the dog barking at the front door. 
I'd locked the door and my husband didn't have a key (he'd forgotten to get it back from a friend who had stayed with us recently). I opened the door. There was my husband

This is where it get's interesting. Jane is drunk off her ass. Loud
My husband explained the plan: She was far too drunk to drive her car home

As always there was the fun part of being sober and taunting the drunk person. She complained about seeing double. I told her to close one of her eyes and after she confusingly did so her face lit up like a child on christmas morning. 
I also told her to down a glass of water before bed then take an airborne in the morning when she revealed she needed to be in another state for an event the coming night. I doubt she remembered

At one point
She drunkenly confronted me
I looked straight at her

My husband later told me about her various attempts to seriously come onto him throughout the night and the car ride home where she went so far as to grab his hand and put it on her crotch. He had the drunk talk with her, as well).
The fun part? Her relationship is a OPP. We ALL know this.

My husband voiced quite a bit of concern, she might have made some seriously regrettable choices. 

My husband and I also had quite a bit of fun the next day as he retold various parts of the evening. We laughed and then we agreed that this is a funny-one-time humor and should never happen again.

Some people talk about how poly is so much better than mono. I'm poly because that's what I am. It's got it's good sides and it's bad sides. Some of the bad is that you get presented with all the crazy that comes with the trial and error of dating. I don't actually like that part.

The broken refrigerator analogy (http://www.morethantwo.com/jealousypractice.html) is something that really spoke to me when I first read about it.

The analogy goes like this:

*Imagine you have a refrigerator. One day, and your vegetables

You have three options at the moment: you can figure out how to fix the refrigerator; you can throw it away and buy a new one; or

The last option is patently ridiculous; and yet it is the one most people in the poly community seem to choose. That is

The article I linked to above goes into LOTS of detail explaining it

I had an experience the other day that made me think back to the refrigerator analogy:

Miss Prism was joking to a female friend of hers

It got to the point where I was going to pull them both aside and tell them I wouldn't be comfortable with Mr Oldman having a threesome unless I got to be a part of it

Then I thought about the refrigerator. Clearly

I thought about Mr Oldman. I imagined the joy on his face if this hypothetical threesome were to occur

Then I thought about why I was feeling jealousy - it's because I wanted to do something nice for my partner. I wanted to make him happy. And him having a threesome with two other women wouldn't infringe on that; in fact,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,t3_u8ph9

About a year ago my husband (26) and I (29) decided to open our relationship. I had always felt some polyamorous tendencies and he and I had discussed for a couple of years before actually trying to meet new people. I had never felt like I was in a relationship that could handle the addition of other partners before my husband. He was a bit hesitant at first

It went pretty well for us for a while; we were both successful in finding dates and both found secondary partners. My boyfriend was a fair bit older than my husband and his girlfriend

I felt like my relationships with other men made me feel closer to my husband. We talked more, his girlfriend and her fiance) would hang out, he would stay out with her when he was supposed to come home with me. When the four of us were together, I would feel invisible to him and he would be overly affectionate with her. There were times when I would be literally pulling him away from her towards me and it didn't work. His sex and sexual experimentation with her got more frequent and more advanced, and then he stopped initiating sex with me at all. He continued to text her when out on date nights with me, and then the date nights with me became less frequent. We had a lot of talks about it, and a lot of fights. Each time we had a talk I stressed that I felt all of the issues had the same root cause - when he was with her, then he'd find some new way to hurt me all over again. I felt like he loved her more and she got the best of him

During the meltdown phase, I wanted it to work, I just didn't want him to treat me like I didn't matter to him anymore. Anyway, we tried it for a while and things just got worse. He started lying to me about when he was talking to her. He brought her to our apartment while I was gone for a day when I specifically asked him not to. That was it for me, I felt so marginalized and hurt. I felt like he cheated on me. After our worst fight ever, he agreed to break up with her. 

That was back in March. So it's been 4 months of just my husband and I trying to rebuild and it isn't working at all. I feel like we're closer to divorce than the loving relationship we once had. I'm just so angry at him all the time. He says that he loves me, sexy, beautiful, like I could accomplish anything. I feel none of that now. His girlfriend was much more attractive than I am, so now when I look at myself I just feel ugly and disgusted. My self esteem is gone, from my personal life and my work life. I have no motivation to do anything - I never want to go anywhere and when I do go out with my husband the only thing on my mind is how much more fun he'd be having if he was with her instead. I honestly believe that my husband would be happier with her in the long run, that he married me before he knew what it was that would actually make him happy. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure if I even love my husband anymore. When I look at him I see someone completely different than the man that I married. I see someone that lied to me, or do something to hurt him so that he feels the way I do. Sometimes when I look at myself I see someone so ugly, worthless, and pathetic that I feel I deserve this and it was my fault for being so stupid as to think that someone like me could hold the interest of a man. And sometimes I'm even mad at him for taking polyamory away from me. I'm scared that the only thing that's stopping us from getting better is me and my inability to get over my anger, but I just don't know how to forgive him and start trusting him again. I'm scared the man that I loved and married is gone forever and it's my fault. 

I guess I know what you're going to say. See a counselor. Divorce him. I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for or can be given.

I'm not against their relationship, sleep together, whatever they want to do. I'll even sleep in the other room if that makes them feel more comfortable. 

But they don't want that. So now I'm stuck not having my husband with me when I can go into labor at any given moment. He is being ""fair"" about it. Right now he sees her 3 nights a week

He is always close and I know that labor doesn't go that fast for a first time mom. I can call him at any time and he will be home within the hour.

I just wish I wasn't the only one trying. I feel like I am. I feel like I am making all this effort... I feel like I am trying to do everything I can... and they (both) just refuse to work with me and become more comfortable to all be together so I don't have to be alone if labor starts.

This is probably a lot of hormones as well. Maybe I am exaggerating. 

She is younger, that he won't have time for her anymore. And I understand that he loves her and wants to do what he can to make her feel good. And I understand that I am more mature about this, more comfortable with this lifestyle and therefor more sacrifice is being asked of me.

But I don't want to spend the night alone again. I'm scared. I've never done this giving birth thing before. I don't know what is going to happen... (well.. I've read all the books

Am I way out of line to ask him to stay home at night? She is going on a holiday next week so for at least a week and a half he will be home with me

Is this just me being hormonal? I get that normal fair is more or less equal time. But am I way out of line to think that normal fair doesn't really count right now? That I should be more important? That just because I could handle him not being here

Her on the other hand, it doesn't take much for her to find a willing partner. It's really just nubmers at this point.

So, but I've been finding myself kinda lonele lately and she's been out with new partners.

We were talking about things recently and she said something (that she's said before

""I'm not responsible for your happiness.""

While that's true, my mind kinda replaces things and it turns into, ""I know this thing I'm going to do is going to hurt you, but I don't care.""

I don't know whether I'm putting too much thought into that. Maybe I need to stop sucking at dating and do better. Maybe I just suck and Poly isn't for me. Maybe I should stop being a sensitive snowflake.

I dunno

So

The setup was [m]e and my wife travelling to my (medium distance) gf, we are more like a ""w"", since my gf has a husband, who also has a gf). We arrived on saturday around noon and although the first greeting was a slightly bit awkward, we quickly relaxed and did the usual ""look at my home""-tour and then had some coffee together. And this was really nice to relax together and to catch up on everything. And after a short while my wife went ahead and said to my gf: ""Could you show me, how I get to that café you mentioned? I think you two want to get your alone-time!"" - We had agreed before, that my wife would spend the afternoon in the city, writing. But since my gf and me were both a bit nervous to just bluntly send my wife off

We then brought her to the tram together, so.. we made up for that time. Some hours later we went into town and fetched my wife, walked around a bit and then decided to cook instead of going to a restaurant, since the sushi place we had in mind was totally crowded. So we returned to my gf's place and cooked ourselves a nice dinner and later sat together on the couch, cuddling and talking and drinking a bit. Since my wife had her period, she told us to just go ahead and hit the sheets for another round, while she stayed on the couch to read. And since I always obey my wife... ;)

Later the three of us cuddled together in my gf's bed

Then we made a really lazy and decadent brunch with eggs and bacon, kissing, cuddling. It was all so absolutely harmonic! Since we were so exhausted from all this eating, we decided it's time for another nap... and after a shower we did a stroll through a nearby park, hand in hand in hand! And we shifted positions all the time, like we had this planned, which was also really wonderful. And I enjoyed a bit the looks from strangers, sometimes envious :D

It's been driving me nuts lately how, of the opposite gender the responses always seem to go along the lines of ""guys are only friends with girls if they want to get inside their pants, obviously something's going on or she wouldn't be hanging out with him"". Really? Are there really still people, in the year 20-fucking-11 who honestly believe that a man and a woman cannot genuinely want to be friends without there always being a subtext of ""trying to get into their pants""? Now, don't get me wrong, if it's a case of sneaking around seeing the friend without telling your partner or ignoring your partner when they voice their apprehensions about it that's something else, what keeps annoying me is just the attitude that it's not possible to be friends with someone who you're potentially sexually attracted to without there being ulterior motives and without it being perceived as a threat to the relationships you're in (especially male-female friendships as I've not seen this being called a problem as much when it's same sex friends even if one or both of them are bi or gay). I mean, or even having sex

And the thing is... I get monogamy (or, who knows? I love poly (at least in theory as I haven't tried it yet) and the attitudes that tend to go hand-in-hand with it (openness, honesty etc) but I still think that for a lot of people, maybe even for me, mono is still the more favorable choice. However, I *cannot* understand this need to extend the ""mono-ness"" beyond the sexual and romantic sphere and into the social, friendship sphere (mono-amity, lol)! If you trust that your partner wouldn't cheat on you then it shouldn't matter who their friends are so long as they still listen to you and are upfront with you about it. And if you genuinely think that your partner is likely to cheat on you at any moment and the only reason they maintain certain friendship is for sex

This is likely to be a bit scattered as I decided to just let it go from brain to keyboard without any filter or organization. Forgive the mess.

I come from a conservative family. You can take the weight of that statement and amplify it a bit. But as I've distanced my self from them

I met a girl. She became a peer a friend and I felt my self falling for her. I'm a terribly shy person. I asked her out. Took 3 weeks to pysche my self up to do it. But we went out and I felt as though things were really clicking. Been seeing her more and more over the past several weeks. Its like I had finally met some one who I could make a real connection with, my passions, and my little slice of this world with.

And then, and maybe some one else, and I realize I'm standing in the middle of a group of people who quite possibly are all in multiple relationships.... I was in stunned silence and the expression on my face was probably much like you would expect the onlookers of such an elephant in a dining hall.

I'm fairly good at compartmentalizing. The information was too much to be processed on the spot. I let it wash over me like a bucket of ice water took a breath and then moved forward. If anyone noticed my shock they were kind enough not to say anything to me about it. 

Once I was alone with my thoughts: Fear, frustration, tears, text messages to friends (not imparting peoples personal business just that I suddenly felt crushed, best not to comment on other peoples relationships conventional or unconventional relationships... conventional shitty term, conventional by the crap standards of my up bringing more like. ) ... 

Google. Turn off the emotion factory for a moment and learn something.

Information overload. I know nothing about this. This didn't even exist to me until that moment. It is as far from something I even believed possible as the most distant stars in the sky. 

FEAR. 

but...

I still feel the same about her, she still challenges me to be better, she still sets me on fire when she walks into the room....

Assessment:

I don't want to get crushed

I don't want her to get hurt

I don't want anyone she's involved with to get hurt....


That last one surprised me even as I thought it. I've never... the concept of anything other than a pair... Again

But this scares me to the core. I want to come to terms with that. There isn't currently a stated relationship between us. ... I'm sure that term is probably going to get tossed out the window some where along the way too... 'stated...' bleh. Or not.... 

--walked away from the keyboard for a moment shift in train of thought--

Jealousy, more, how many, how when?  if I want to pursue this. ... I don't have words to describe why my stomach is churning and my blood feels like ice in my veins ... if I want to pursue this I need to be something more than I am now and I'm not certain how to get there. 

We have not talked about this yet her and I. Things are calm

Conceptually I can understand how this can work in all its variations. In practice I've seen only dysfunctional pairings; my own relationships as well as those of my social circles. If I couldn't ever get things to work with one person how could I ever juggle the wants and needs and concerns... the heart of another person in her life who may not even want me to be part of her life.... I want to be better, and for the them that I don't yet know...

So that's my life at the moment laid bare. I'm a bit of a wreck at the moment its a lot to process. So... yeah. Hi new world I didn't know existed. I'm a bit lost and confused and kind of scared but I want to understand.

1344898621.0,y6534,Another positive poly (triad) story! ,,47,5,10,"My husband and I have been in a triad for almost three years

Our relationship was the first poly experience for any of us, even though we live in different states, was one of the most challenging and ultimately fulfilling experiences of my entire life.  I have learned so much from being in a triad.  

I have learned what true love is.  I have learned that love is trust and honesty and communication.  I experienced compersion for the first time and was stunned at the love that I was capable of experiencing.  Seeing my husband with our gf made me indescribably happy.  I was completely taken off guard by how happy it made me to see them happy and loving with each other.  

Being in the triad helped me truly connect with and understand my bisexuality in a way that I never thought possible.  I thought being bisexual and married to a man meant the side of me that is attracted to women could never be fulfilled.  The last few years have made me see that I am truly blessed to have a partner who loves all of me and wants to see me happy and knows that who I sleep with has no impact on how much I love him.  

It is sad when a relationship ends, even more so since he saw it coming and was less stunned/shocked than I was.  Though it is strange to not be a triad anymore, our marriage is stronger than it has ever been.  The sex is better than it has ever been.  I honestly cannot imagine anything that could break up my marriage now, and I know I would not feel that way had we not opened up our marriage to our ex-gf and had all the experiences we have had with her.  

Will we ever have another girlfriend?  I don't know.  I really hope so.   But we aren't rushing things.  It's just good to know that if and when the situation ever presents itself again

TL; DR:  My triad just ended and my husband and I are back to just the two of us.  I'm grateful for our triad time and do not regret a thing.

*August 2010 - I fall in love with my wife's friend hardcore. I had my reasons. We both loved our spouses and didn't want to end our marriages. We just had this love out of no where that was crazy powerful. ie. Other people saw it.

* August 2010 - My wife and her husband find out. We told them. My wife and him start talking about what they are going to do. Each decides they are going to fight for us

* Sept 2010 - My wifes friend gets pregnant. No it's not mine. We refrained from having sex out of respect for our marriages.

* Sept 2010 --&gt; March 2010 - My relationship with my wife gets alot better. I start feeling a love for her I didn't have for a long time. Marriage is great. I still am in love with her friend and we share an occasional kiss.

* March 2010 - I tell the truth about the kisses. She flips out but realizes other than the lying

* April 2010 - My wife tells me she loves him and is down with the whole poly idea. She said she was considering it for sometime.

* April 2010 - Jealousy starts for me bigtime. Really not a good time.

* June 2010 - Wife has sex with him for first time. Still not doing well but getting a grip on the jealousy. 

* July 2010 - My OSO has her baby.

* Last night - I made love to my OSO and it was amazing. Although we had to be careful because of her recently giving birth. Still it was an amazing experience

* Tonight - My wife is out with her husband and I am feeling great. I have gotten past my jealousy.

So my journey continues. I love two of the most beautiful and special women in the world. My wife encourages my relationship with her friend and they have grown to be like sisters more so than my wife's real sister. I fell like the luckiest man alive. I have never been

My roommate and very close friend and I were both poly. He got involved with a girl who was crazy about him, but the mutual resentment about the issue was so intense that neither of them were particularly constructive about it. Even still, they loved each other intensely. She had a serious drinking problem and since he also had a similar (though not as extreme) habit he let it slide, even though I (and I hope other friends as well) tried to alert him to the fact that their collective behavior and relationship dynamic seemed really unhealthy.

One night they went out drinking and came back to the house (where my roommate and I lived with 2 other friends), at 2am, the house was in flames and all of us made it out... except her.

My friend immediately moved in with his ex and has been seeing her and another lady. It's been a month since the disaster. I haven't been terribly close with him because I'm shaken and angry and in such a vastly different place than he is, but the little time they had together was already eroded by suppressed pain from their conflict over polyamory.

In my own life, and I didn't really feel the desire to do so. I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything and when we broke up I didn't have a huge urge to pursue anyone, but fairly immediately I met someone really amazing. A week before the fire, we went on a first date, and I felt a huge shift - I was absolutely disinterested in pursuing anyone else, period. Shortly thereafter I cut things off with a long-time lover and didn't even bat an eye - my heart just wasn't in it. After the fire, my new beloved was incredible and supportive and the communication between us has been amazing. I still maintain that I don't want to make any monogamous agreements/assumptions in our relationship, but I know my days of being polyamorous are over. 

It's hard to explain, friends, and this new love, I just want to enjoy fewer things in my life in general. It's weird, it's like I'm intensely driven to minimalism in my general outlook, and polyamory conflicts with that need too much for me to continue identifying that way. I feel like my entire person has undergone a major shift and instead of clinging to the pieces of my old life I just need to shrug it off and move on.

Warning: if you have weight issues

My husband and I are mildly poly or swing-y - not sure of the right word

When we go out on Friday nights (which we do pretty much every week), right? Ok, fine. But the vast majority of these girls are hotter and thinner than me. And that makes me feel like he would really rather if I were hotter and thinner than I am. But I feel like I'm supposed to make approving noises about these girls, because looking at hot girls is ""something we have together"".

I am pretty - people get crushes on me - but I'm not drop-dead gorgeous

I know my husband doesn't want me to be unhappy

Or maybe I should try to slim down. I took size 12 pants when I met him (almost a decade ago). Should I be trying to get back to that? Should I try to compete with these girls? I have never been sexy like they are anyway - they dress so skimpy and pose for the cameras in a way that just isn't me.

In fact I have already been trying to slim down - I've been trying to eat low-glycemic-index foods and avoid high-glycemic-index foods for about a year and a half now. Maybe it doesn't work or maybe I need to be stricter about it

I have told my husband a few times that I noticed he pretty much only points out girls that are thinner than me. It doesn't seem to accomplish much other than making us both feel bad. One time he said that he thought looking at pretty girls was something we had together. It is! But it makes me feel bad when they are all thinner than me. One time he said it was because he already had me

For now the agreement is that he will stay at home at night until the baby is born

He will also make an effort to work even more from home so that he is here more time

I am putting my foot down on this. Too bad if the baby still doesn't want to come out for another 4 or 5 weeks (I doubt it
I actually doubt that she will have an issue with this

I think I am being pretty decent in saying that she can be here if she wants to be with him, have dinner, or do whatever is up to them. If she really just wants to be with him, she can get over the weirdness of all of us being together and come over and sleep here. I'll even sleep in the baby room (where we have an extra bed) so they can have the big bed together. 

I know that a lot of you say that he should ""man up"" and things like that, just hormones have really screwed me over and he has a hard time dealing with that (even without the other relationship added in). He feels very helpless to do anything...

There are some more talks that we are going to have to have in the future.

I don't want my baby to have a part time dad, so lets not think about it"" type of guy, where as I prefer to have things clear and sorted beforehand, and be flexible if and when things change. I am also sure that I don't want her to mother my baby. She will be in her life of course, but more as an ""aunt"", when she happens to be with my husband as he is taking care of her. LOL; it is funny how protective I already feel about her, and how much I already feel like I will do anything for my baby to be happy and healthy :)

I also think I might have to talk to her about certain things. I have bend over backwards to give their relationship a chance, or have her in love with me as well (she's not even my type). Just to be included at times. Invited along when they are doing something simple, like watching soccer in the afternoon. Or when they are going to the movies. Anything that suggests that she is aware that I need him as much, if not more, than she does. And that she is really willing to share, and not just pretend I don't exist. That hurts... but I guess that is something that will have to wait until after my baby is born. I don't feel mentally up for having that conversation with her now.

I say OK, let's date but I want the following: open communication and honesty. He says OK. I trust that OK. We have fun every time we see each other. Things went great for weeks after that.


Two months and a couple of weeks later, I still adore you. We are fine 110%."" I feel iffy about it, but I choose to trust what he says. After all, work is important. So I give him space even though it was hard.

He looks thoughtful and says, ""I met someone before I left on my trip but she just gave me a blowjob."" I say OK... but then I'm confused why he didn't choose to tell me. Then he says, ""I also fucked my roommate like a week ago. We fucked before but she needed some, and I wanted to be a good friend so I fucked her."" I go, OK... um... why didn't you tell me then? He says he's telling me now. He says it probably won't happen again. My head says oh it'll happen again. But I decide again, I have to talk to him about safety issues. I know his sexual health (we've both been tested as well as the other girl) and as far as I knew it was just the three of us at this time... but now I don't know. I get nervous but he says he wants me to trust him.  I care about this guy so much

I respond. I am. 


That wasn't a lie. I am OK. I just wish he would have told me.

I am in a MFF ""triad"" closed relationship.  All three of us never expected this to happen and the two females are virtually only attracted to each other and not other women which kind of led to this.

I married my high school sweetheart and been together for 6yrs and this year she finally came out to her long time best friend that she is sexually attracted to her.  And well her friend has always shared those feelings but they never told each other.

I have always known my wife was into her and we roleplayed stuff before dealing with it

I never really communicated with her best friend because she moved to other side of country when they were still in school so we started to txt and then Skype with each other getting to know each other.  Well we ended up becoming really deep friends as well and then talks started about all three of us being together and happy.

I am really sorry if I got off-topic but I have never told anyone our story before and it felt really nice getting it off my chest and finally be able to be happy and out about it with others.

It's also my first truly poly relationship. I've always thought it was a good idea, I find myself NOT wanting to be too intimate with anyone else because he satisfies me so deeply and I would rather save that time for him. There is so much I want to do with him, accomplish, and create that I can't imagine entangling myself with others in the same way. It's funny, because I never felt this in any of my monogamous relationships. I was only monogamous because I felt obligated to. In this case monogamy just seems to be a natural result of my feelings. Also I find that I want to share everyone I love with him and I want to feel love for those people he loves as well. I have no desire for anything separate!

So have any of you in poly relationships ever felt this way before

We've been open/poly now going on three years. She had always had poly relationships before we met

So fast forward to now and I've found in someone what I can best describe as my soul mate. From the moment we started to fall in love it wasn't like we were learning to love

I talked to my wife this morning, real soul touching love and she can't handle it and is pulling away to distance herself because she doesn't have someone else right now.

So we're still going to be life partners. We have kids

My buddy G lives with us.  He's also my wifes boyfriend.  We still have no idea how to refer to one another using the standard relationship words

My girlfriend lives 3 hours away.  We don't see each other that often, and my girlfriend is pretty much the abuse dumpster because she is simply too nice.  It doesn't help that she is too smart for her family, and it doesn't help that her relationship status is too strange for her family.  It especially doesn't help that she has medical problems and the abuse has escalated to physical abuse.

Well, we're getting her out of that abusive household.  I'm not going to leave you all with some sob story about how life sucks...  My family and I fix problems.  It's going to be tough.  For too many reasons to list, the best solution is that she and I live in the master bedroom, and my wife goes to G's bedroom.  He works in a travelling job so he's out of town monday through friday.  This way I can still ""be"" with my wife even though we'll all be jumping beds throughout the week...  Yeah, weird, but it should work.  We're putting ourselves into a bit more stress for what we all believe to be the greater good...

Were you waiting for the ""but"" part to the story?  Here you go;

It is the strangest sensation.  My wife and I are moving her stuff out of ""our"" bedroom.

We know that nothing is changing between us.  Heck, and moving things is pretty much the penultimate part of splitting up.  Knowing something in your head is different from knowing something in your heart and we've had our little crying moments where we remind ourselves that nothing is really changing.

So

It's going to be so nice.  My girlfriend can finally live with an accepting and loving family.  Right now though

1371708283.0,1gpn3o,I want to share our positive experience in becoming poly. :),NerdyGingerChick,44,6,33,"My husband and I have been poly for a whopping three months now

We met a married couple, for I knew not what I did!). He smiled and said, ""something like that.""

In March we ran into them again at a party. Our friends tend to be very flirty and touchy anyway, and the alcohol did not help me keep quiet about that fact. After a while of rubbing and talking, he simply asked me if I wanted to go make-out.

Now, but I obviously needed to know what my husband thought of that idea. So I said, ""Let me ask David."" Aaron said he would go get Tammy, and we could all have fun.

So I went to my husband. ""Tammy and Aaron want to make out with us. You interested?"" ""Uh, not okay. I touched his hand, and he stopped. No words needed. But then it was Tammy's turn on Rock Band, so she left.

Aaron walked away for a moment

The next morning, even though it was obviously not for us. For one thing, we are way to jealous to ever try that!

But we liked our new friends

As one might expect, but we're fine the way things are. But maybe we should invite them to stay over after the show. They can stay in the guest room, and we can all hang out longer. A few nights later we discussed how it would be okay if we all kissed and played around a little bit, nothing serious. Yeah that sounds okay.

Finally, Tammy started to caress my arm. I know that Tammy was bi, but I am not. I mean, sure, I make out with girls sometimes, but that's all... That sounds like fun actually. Tammy and I touched and kissed, stopping every so often to remind someone to keep his eyes on the road. We pulled up to the house.

Inside we got everyone some drinks and settled into the couches. I liked sitting next to Aaron. David seemed to be enjoying being next to Tammy. They had brought a game for us to play called “The Game.” It's like a sexy truth or dare game with the top cards being full on sex. We stuck to the lower cards at first. Kissing, touching. But then we got into the higher point cards. Are blowjobs okay? Sure, why not. Then everyone was definitely ready for more. We really should have come to a solid decision on how far we should go. David looked to me, ""I'm for it. What do you say?""

All four of us fit easily on our king size bed. What is Aaron doing? David never does it like that. Do I like it. Yes, I was there too.

We all cleaned up, we moved to the guest room.

That was a wonderful night for all four of us. David and I decided to give poly a shot. We talked about it, our boundaries almost exclusively for many days. Soon Aaron was my boyfriend. And for the very first time last night I told my husband that I was in love with another man, and that Aaron loves me too! My wonderful husband was able to smile and be happy for me. I couldn’t be happier right now. I hope you enjoyed our story. ☺",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1gpn3o/i_want_to_share_our_positive_experience_in/

So I wanted to update! :) Things are going well, every Friday for the last two Fridays (and apparently every Friday in the future) she has been coming over after the fire-spinning and hanging out. 

The first Friday it was pretty obvious that she didn't quite know what to think of me, I know my husband will let me know. I basically kept our conversation nice and light, and tried to stay out of their hair.

Now last night she came over and I could tell she was much more comfortable, I tried my best to stay out of their hair and show her I was more than okay with their relationship: I made them popcorn, acted like a good host, and then even took a nice, long, overdue shower (I had the baby all day and needed the break!) after my daughter had been put to bed.

My hubby did try to include me, spouting that this was their time and I was just watching the movie.

Now, since it's the only day I have off) and he knows it, lol. Now that I know she'll be over on Fridays, I might try to figure out what I can do. She always comes over very late though (passed ten PM), so there really isn't much to do with our daughter at that point. Besides, she seems to want to get to know me due to our conversation last night, so maybe me being there will eventually not be so bad for her.

**1) Feel Jealous When You Feel Jealous**

view jealousy as a natural and neutral emotion, but that’s crap! all feelings are valid, including jealousy. it’s what you DO with those feelings that really counts. which leads us to…

**2) Own Your Feelings**
(yes

take ownership of your feelings (by talking about and/or working through them honestly) and do NOT use your emotions to control or manipulate others’ behaviour. owning our feelings doesn’t mean excusing someone else’s actions that may have contributed to our feelings; it DOES mean reacting to our feelings with agency and without intent to harm in return.

i like using the analogy of punching to understand how owning feelings works. for example

a) you could punch her back
b) you could say
c) you could say nothing, and the next…
d) you could say nothing and avoid that friend from now on.
e) you could yell
f) you could scrunch up your face and whimper
g) you could say, but it makes me feel really vulnerable and unsafe.”

Some of these options, e, and f are ways of expressing your feelings around being punched. A couple of those reactions are certainly intended to cause harm in return (a and e), which is normally something we want to avoid. An exception would be if, say, your friend kept punching you, over and over - when we’re being abused like this, and depending on the situation

f might be an automatic reaction (sometimes we respond to things in childlike ways because they bring up feelings from childhood or because we haven’t developed a grown up way of dealing with them), we are falling into passive-aggressive behaviours that can really damage relationships over time.

c and d are avoidance tactics. it’s okay to avoid things sometimes. maybe this was a one-time thing

b is really straightforward and assertive… if your friend is a decent person, this is a great option…

But often we have other reasons for not wanting to be treated a certain way. If punchy friend isn’t really a close friend, you might want to explain where your feelings are coming from, like in g. You’re not saying she caused you to feel them, though in a way she did by creating the environment in which they surfaced, but you are owning your own feelings and asserting how you would like &amp; deserve to be treated.

**3) Cut The Crap**

minimize or limit your exposure to mainstream media (and when you do watch it, families, sexualities, and cultures. almost everyone tends to think they are the exception to having their attitudes and beliefs shaped by media… but trust me, there’s no such thing as being immune to cultural influences. the trick is to be aware of how you are affected and to actively &amp; intentionally work against that.

**4) Do What You Love**

*Spend your days doing what you love and love

everyone needs to take time for themselves. for basic self-care that keeps us healthy and functioning, preferences, and dreams. for some people, self-care might include connecting with others, but this particular stuff, the stuff that makes us US, are things that happen when we are alone and taking time to dream and reflect.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/zq03k/poly_tips_that_work_for_all_kinds_of_nonpoly/

My husband, but are now more like roommates than anything.  My husband is bipolar, so it's hard for him to maintain connections with people, if that's necessary to know.  I also have a FWB and my husband and I share a girlfriend.

My boyfriend happens to be my Dom.  He and I have an amazing sex life, very vanilla.  I personally don't really enjoy vanilla sex as much...  I like the connection with my husband and don't feel I have to climax for it to be fun, but he thinks that if I'm not super into it that it's not worth it and it puts him off.  He also isn't into doing it really rough, saying sexy things, etc.  He really does like plain ol' sex.  Any suggestions I made to compromise were shot down because he just doesn't like them (they make him uncomfortable/feel awkward) and neither of us will enjoy it if someone is forcing it.  My husband does however have good sex with our girlfriend, who is into both vanilla and kinky sex, and since they started to date he has definitely had much more sex with her than with myself.

We agreed to take a break from sex for an undetermined amount of time.  I made sure he knew it wasn't all about the sex for me to love him and that I love him intellectually, and the same goes for him and his girlfriend (they don't talk as much).

I guess I'm just sharing and opening discussion...  Anybody else out there maintain a partner/spouse that they aren't sexual with?  Did you try anything else in your journey to a non-sexual relationship?  Do you feel it's more possible to maintain such a relationship because you have other relationships filling your other needs?

Don't get me wrong, but I very much am satisfied having multiple partners with multiple qualities and quirks.  :)",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,

So, but we did do just about everything else. We both went twice and had huge smiles on our faces when we came back to the living room where my wife was.

And can you believe it? She was so happy for us! We talked about how we felt now that something had happened in real life

So now we've got this thing with another girl, and I love her more than anything...this only makes me love her more. Its really sparked our sex life into a whole new chapter. And we both totally trust her friend because they were friends first; she's not going to try to get between us.

Last night my wife and I went on our first date as a poly couple.  She had never been with another woman and wanted us to ""go for it"" together.  We met up with a woman that we had spoken with a bit online at a cozy little artsy bar called Picasso's.  The wife and I were SO nervous.  I'm sure our date was too, for the first hour, my wife was so shy and oblivious, that she couldn't tell that our new friend (who was sitting next to her) was putting her hand under the table to hold her hand.  I had to give her ""pro tips"" on how to interpret incoming signals of interest while our date was in the bathroom.  After she got back, my wife caught on, much to our date's delight, they got closer and closer, laughed, moved to the big soft couches, watched muted spanish soap operas


EDIT!!!:  Second date last night.

So after the decidedly successful first date, after the previous night's happenings, the wife and our friend were noticeably distracted from normal conversation and kept glancing and smiling at each other.  They didn't kiss again upon meeting, which was cute, because I could tell they were both thinking about it and just couldn't work up the nerve.  So, we watched the parade, laughed and cheered, and then, I won't go into explicit detail only because we pretty much got naked and pleasured each other for 5 or 6 hours straight.  My wife kissed

EDIT PART 2:  The Detailing.  Caution!  This is really explicit.  It's kind of embarrassing how detailed it is but read at your own peril.  Also

Ok, squeezing, licking, sighing, me smiling as I watched them go at it.  You might wonder why I didn't just jump in.  Well, this was my wife and our new friends first time with their same sex.  I wanted their memories of that contact to be pure and without my bumbling self involved.  I planned on letting them completely explore each other before I even got undressed.  That plan, like many things formed with good intentions, my wife turned over and said something to the effect of ""why isn't that cock out yet
Then, she could ""tag out"" to Friend.  When I announced that they were going to make me cum (normally when Wife leans away due to a aversion to jizz...  I know... so sad), Wife said ""do it"" and Friend sucked down the entire load.  They had discussed this secretly and were delighted to learn that Friend was obsessed with eating cum.  Sneaky bitches :D!  My mind exploded. 
After an hour or so, carried over to her mouth and fingers.  Wife screamed so loud, it scared Friend's cats.
We spent the rest or the night playing
Friend had to work early the next morning so we eventually kissed her goodnight together

A's gossip has put R in a nasty position with a number of their ('til now) mutual friends

R and P are breaking up for now, but I'm a little worried about how to keep our friendship strong with this strain on it, especially since R is the person who is seeing the worst effects of A's actions.  If anyone has advice on this I'd love to hear it.

We also need to figure out the best way to put the kibosh on A's gossip.  We're going to try asking both her and her fiance nicely (though I honestly don't think she'll listen to his opinion on this, what are our options?

Legally, but I don't know that anyone there will take our side, especially if we are honest about the polyamory.

Socially, since that family member is the biggest link to our families and the social group A and R (and P and I to a lesser degree) run in, but I'll probably be using that line a lot in the coming weeks.  I would guess that my spearheading that effort will probably help to dampen her effectiveness (both since I am supposedly the ""wronged"" person and since I'm generally known for being the sweet quiet girl who is only assertive when someone's done something truly horrible).  On the other hand, might acknowledging the rumors make people more curious?  Might they feed into her destruction instead of working as damage control?

There's a part of me that really wants to start working at getting A banned from events she loves and rejected by her friend-group, gossiping, and generally being a bitch, but it's so tempting to speed the process in any way possible, and simply telling people why we kicked her out would likely be enough to destroy her in a lot of social circles.   For that matter, a little of me wonders if I shouldn't be warning people just so they don't end up physically, emotionally, or monetarily messed up like she's done to us and other people she's bragged to us about.  Hell

I guess, and how to help R and P to deal with this as well as possible.

And when he recently, for the first time in our two-year relationship, had sex with someone other than me and I badgered him into telling me how it was (I know...bad move), he pretty much told me that she was straight-up better than me. So if he has the daily choice between having sex with me and someone better, why would he ever choose me?

(I wasn't in the room, but I could hear a good portion of the conversation through our thin walls.  I wasn't trying to creep, I tried and failed.)

First of all

Anyway

My wife and I just recently were married in October and she is now realizing that she has developed a crush on her MOH.  She realized this after getting upset when her MOH told her about having made out with another girl the previous night.  (My wife has always been bi-curious and finds herself very attracted to woman, because her and the MOH have had a playful ""lesbian"" relationship where they often joke about doing things together and they get very ""friendly"" at parties.  It has gotten to the point where my wife really doesn't know if she is still just joking around or if there is actually something there.  On one had she acts as though she's very interested, but on the other says she's only into ""Penis"".

Now, but she just wants to know so she can either move on to finding another girl or if her MoH actually has feelings for her seeing where that leads.

Another level of complexity.  Personally, exactly how she feels. But as a guy who is extremely turned on by the thought of my wife being with another woman, it's difficult to do.  I am also attracted to the MoH, which is mutual.  Leading up to the wedding the MoH would joke that she was going to have sex with me only after I was married.  She did this openly in front of my wife, which was fine because we often make a lot of very sexual jokes.

I've identified as poly since I was 19, a lot of healing from past emotional/sexual trauma and a lot of learning. That guy is, to this day, one of my closest, most trusted friends. 

That was almost 10 years ago. I've been the unicorn. I've been engaged (though we broke up for reasons unrelated to poly.) I've dated up to 3 people at a time, but every time a relationship ended, I tried really hard to take a good look at what worked well, what didn't, and what future relationships might look like. Feels good to be honest and real with yourself and other people. 

Almost a year ago I moved cross-country from the Western US to the Northeast, which has a thriving, very interconnected poly community. I found a community in my new home that seemed open to my usual style of relationship. Then something interesting happened: I met M. 

M is the most compatible partner I've ever had in my life. It's been almost 9 months together and I never ever get tired of his face, he was interested. But, much to my surprise, I don't feel the urge to seek out other relationships. I occasionally fantasize about having a girlfriend again (something M very much supports) but it's always short-lived. (Though I do have a very close female friend who is occasionally a lover and who adores M as well, so there's that.) M will tell me he's crushing on this or that person, and I totally encourage him to seek out opportunities to get to know them, but nothing's ever come of that. He once said to me

I thought about it and replied

I guess just because I feel like this is really a community, just to let people know that relationship styles *do* change over time, as we learn and grow and that's okay.

I have only ever been in monogamous, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life building a family with him. When we married, I gave up the idea of a relationship with a woman because I am so 100% sure of my love for my man, and didn't know anything else was possible. I didn't see it as a loss, because I was gaining my husband, just as something that would have been interesting, but I'd never know. No big deal.  Last summer we started hanging out with a co-worker of his due to kid play-dates, and I laid down the ""no emotions"" rule between the three of us. However, and realized that polyamory was an option for us. r/polyamory gave us a foundation and tools to pursue a triad (thanks guys!). I was very nervous at first, and she seems to be very in sync with the both of us. 
Now, everything feels right. I'm amazed at how easy this transition has been, and how well the three of us run the house together. 
And, but the issues that have come up have been either thought or talked through with relative ease. Is this normal?! I'm truly shocked at how easy it's been to share my husband with her, and myself. When I see them kiss or cuddle, I feel warmth and happiness, not cold jealousy. Who knew?? 
While my relationship with her is progressing at a slower rate than her and my husband, and I relax just being around her. And it feels wonderful to explore a relationship with a woman, something I had thought I'd never get a chance to do!

The thing is

And it makes me incredibly uncomfortable that he has given himself the right to discuss my private life with his other partner.

I've tried talking to him about it and he remains adamant about the fact that he wants to be 100% honest with her about everything. 

Am I crazy for wanting my boundaries? 
Should my requests be ignored because I am a secondary partner?

First, but hear me out. 

My wife is incredibly sexy and wouldn't have any problem getting guys or girls on her own

So from my perspective, and honestly I know that would make life a lot easier because single guys seem to be a dime a dozen no matter what community you're in. I don't want to be the asshole but I'm afraid if we try a truly separate approach - with each of us looking for people individually and doing most of the poly stuff apart - it'll end up with her having what she wants and me getting left out in the cold. What's more, even if we did both get separate girlfriends I don't really have an interest in pursuing romance that doesn't involve my wife in any way.

So I guess what I'm saying is that going poly just makes me feel kind of hopeless about being a straight guy. Is it so bad to want an inclusive relationship? I'm not asking for someone to like both of us exactly the same

Also, we've tried swinging. That's fun, sure, but that community seems to be really into the physical, hedonistic aspects of sex and we both like the idea of something more meaningful, someone we could take out to dinner, go hiking with, really interact with and appreciate

I wanted to ask where one gets the energy and drive to *want* to maintain multiple intimate relationships and then to actually do it

I read *The Ethical Slut* and have been furiously processing since. I wanted to find out what makes polyamory attractive and to understand some of the core concepts. I was also sincerely curious about how this stuff works for people.

The book is written as a guide for people who already know polyamory interests them

A lot of *The Ethical Slut* -- the parts about communication, not just those interested in the book’s main topic.

I felt great admiration for the authors and for everyone willing to challenge the larger culture’s mores but I felt deeply sad many times while reading. Certainly many of the personal anecdotes in the book are sad, and the mores of the period I was born conspired to make me someone whose relationship options have always been narrow due to baggage like my emotional issues, my introversion, and my poor social skills.

Before you say, but you don’t root out some kinds of damage quickly. I’m emotionally healthier now than I’ve ever been. I’m happy most of the time, my relationship is in better shape than ever, and in the past several years I’ve finally learned how to behave well enough at work to hold down a job. These may seem trivial to you, but they were very difficult for me. A solid set of accomplishments given where I was 12 years ago.

Like Charlotte Joko Beck says

It was also odd to realize that I feel sex-positive about *everyone else’s* desires and habits but when it comes to my own sexuality

And really what it comes down to for me is, my poor social skills, and my introversion would make me poor company and understandably unwelcome at various kinds of play parties. Hell, I make most people uncomfortable just trying to talk about the weather; I can’t imagine how awkward I’d be at a swing or a BDSM play party, for example, where social cues are apparently vitally important. So it’s better for everyone if I keep tending to my garden, making my little increments of progress

I think I wanted to post this mostly to say that I admire your courage and I envy how well-adjusted most who post here seem to be. I also thought it might be helpful to see the perspective of an oddball outcast for whom polyamory would be unwise. It’s just not an option.

1. Guys won't talk to me anymore
Added on to this is a weird double standard that girls have no problem talking to my husband though -- it's like I had nothing to offer the world but my sex
2. If I'm anywhere near friends and I fuss at my husband for any reason
3. The worst of these to me is being told by people not my husband when I'm acting inappropriately as a wife. Recently, every girl was -- at some point though while dancing a male friend approached me and told me that it wasn't fair for me to be so sexy while being married. Worse than that when said guy was sober later he apologized for being flirty...to my husband.    
    
Long story short - I am no longer treated like an individual - some people have told me that that's just how this is, but I want to be able to be as free and open and individual as we are both happy with and why is that anyone else's business? Sigh.

I was married 25 years. It was a disastrous relationship that scarred everyone involved. (She had Borderline Personality Disorder and I had a nasty case of co-dependency.) We split up 8 years ago.

Not long after, open, honest. The polar opposite of my ex-wife. I fell hard and I fell fast. Six months into the relationship, I realized I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. She is the best friend I ever had.

We were both very sex-crazy in those early days. We talked a lot about what we wanted, but she always pulled back before it ever turned into anything more than heavy petting.

Time passes. Things change. She says she is 100% monogamous, have not changed. I am definitely interested in being sexually involved with women in addition to Gabby. She's back and forth about that. One day she is okay with it, the next day not ok at all.

Here's the thing: she is my one-in-a-billion. I love her more than I ever imagined I would ever love anyone

I absolutely positively will not cheat on her. 100% honesty is my mantra. But most of the time I am also crazy with - I dunno - animal lust? I have reached a point in my life where I have tremendous confidence around all women and am pretty certain I could seduce any woman I focused on. (Gabby agrees with this

I cannot imagine life without her, ""what if you really are polyamorous? What if you are denying who you really are?"" It is very important to us that we allow each other to Be Who We Are and not put constraints on each another. Basically, the only constraint we have is ""Be Honest"". But I fear that acting on this non-mongamous impulse will cost me Gabby.

This may sound dumb but it is a genuine struggle. On the one hand

Am I truly poly or am I just a man-whore? 

I go back and forth. I know I love Gabby more than anything in the world

My fear is that if I act on my innate non-monogamy, I will lose me.

I believe that people are independent entities that should be faithful to their own self, their path to personal growth etc., and they don't have to put any other person, not even the people they love and care for, above themselves.

In a relationship, respectful, and loving, neither partner's needs and desires can have authority over the other, thereby dictating the status quo, and the boundaries of the relationship.

I have somewhat recently separated from my wife of nearly a decade (nothing to do with the poly - everything to do with finding myself cowering in the corner of an abusive marriage and finding the courage to pack my bags).  I now live in a very nice house that I was very fortunate to stumble into renting - crazy-cheap rent

It's not so much jealousy when she's with him, girlfriends, or my wife... I've never come home to a quiet house and maintained no verbal communication until I get to work the next day, and it's rough.  I hate an empty bed... as bad as my marriage became, I'm still very emotionally pained by an empty bed.  So, those nights are rough, but as time goes on, but the bad ones are fewer and farther-between all the time.

----

**EDIT/UPDATE**:  Thank you all for your wonderful words and insight!  A year ago, understanding, and openness that is found in the character of a healthy poly and the people within is frankly, amazing.  I really hope the three of us all make it through and find our solid footing - there is just so much love.

Please feel free to keep posting stories, if you so wish!  I know there's more secondaries out there and it's incredible how much hearing from other people in my situation has helped me.",,False,self,t5_2qu5n,1346762759.0,,

I only told my parents recently that I was back together with them all when I was feeling ready to tell them. 

My boy is smart and lovely and I know I have something with him I won't find in anyone else. The girls are wonderful and sweet and I couldn't ask for more.

So for the amusement of all of you here in r/poly, and good, and that I'm happy with my boy and our girlfriends. My dad is at least trying to wrap his head around it, but my mom is a lost cause.  Enjoy!

You have apparently made a decision within the last 24 hrs.  It makes us sick &amp; nauseated to think that you are involved in this demented relationship.

I personally would love to however we may have to call the paramedics . Anyways your dad just spoke to you tonight so I have changed my e-mail.  Apparently you are now in a communal relationship.

1334069093.0,s2kvw,House mate became jealous of new girl,damia,37,3,25,"My husband and I [F] are poly

Six months ago we got a house mate. She'd been a friend for awhile and the situation worked well. I was able to be open and honest with her about my lifestyle. While she wasn't poly she was curious about the dynamic of it. She was my friend

In January I found a girl I was interested in dating and jumped right in. 
For various reason's the relationship didn't work out.

When I started dating this new girl my house mate became paranoid that she was going to be replaced. I found myself in that typical poly situation of reassuring your primary that they're not loosing ground when you get a secondary - except with a house mate that I wasn't in any form of romantic relationship with. 

0_o

A couple hellacious months brought to light several things: House mate admitted to having a secret-secret crush on both my husband and I - however she was aware of how we felt and didn't expect it to progress anywhere. She had become enamored with the household dynamic. She felt even without sex or romance we had bonded as a type of family. She saw this new girl as invading that dynamic and replacing her role in it - actually superseding it as there was also a sexual attraction. 

I tried to work with her on these issues and eventually came to the conclusion that it was an insecurity she had to fix within herself and that wasn't going to happen any time soon. 
The situation and the way she handled it strained our friendship and I'm no longer comfortable with her living in our house. I do hope to remain friends of some kind.

This was my [old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t673n/in_a_relationship_with_two_women_at_once_can_this/)

This may get a little long so apologies in advance. **I'm 34/m. My wife is 32/f. My girlfriend is 25/f**. I feel like there is no where I can post about my situation without being judged. **Been married to my wife for 5.5 years.** I love her to death. **We have a daughter, 2**. A couple years ago my wife had a health issue (after our son was born) and gave me the blessing to seek out a FWB. That is how I met my girlfriend.

We tried to keep things casual but as usual thing never go as planned. I fell for her and her for me. She had an issue with her housing situation about six months after we started hooking up and I offered to let her rent a room at our house. My wife's health concern was resolved but I still had feelings for my girlfriend. My wife agreed to let my girlfriend stay at our home but wanted us to cut out our relationship. We tried and failed. And to complicate matters my girlfriend ended up pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby and we came clean to my wife. My wife was heartbroken at me for violating her trust but she consented to letting her stay at home and we have fallen into a bit of a routine. **Girlfriend ended up being pregnant with twins who are now 6 months**. Both boys and just bundles of joy. My wife loves those kids like her own and I am a good father to them.

The problem I have is I am in love with both my wife and my girlfriend and could never imagine giving either of them up. I am on great terms with them both and we have a make-shift situation that kind of works. Its not perfect and we constantly have issues. The major fights we have are

- **Jealousy &amp; Intimacy**: Kind of a huge one and obvious. My wife thinks she has more of a right to me since she is my wife. This breeds resentment from my girlfriend. Girlfriend isn't perfect either and will purposely do things that bother my wife. I don't sleep with anyone either than my wife or girlfriend. Girlfriend has a slightly higher drive so I am with her a little more but its close to even. There is no sex with anyone else other than me. And if you are curious there is zero sexual attraction between my wife and girlfriend.

- **Public perception**: I almost have to keep my girlfriend and twins a secret. I love them but there is no way for us to do things in public. This is kind of a burden.

- **Family fights**: Both my girlfriend and wife are good mothers and they love all the children as their own. They work together well but there are jealousy problems that come through. There is sort of an issue of our extended families not understanding at all. My reputation has gone to shit with my wife's family as a result of this.

I'm not sure where we stand legally. I assume I am fine and no one would care but I do get some snide comments from people that know about everything. I'm the only working member of the household and I do well. I run my own business and bring in between $200-300k a year. My wife hasn't worked in a number of years and with the babies its hard for my girlfriend to work. We probably don't need their income anyways. 4 little kids are expensive but we aren't starving. I think its sustainable long term. My wife is pushing for another baby which probably will happen so that is another expense. I have some nerves about that but I have been good about saving and being cost conscious. Of our worries its the least.

I'm just completely nervous and scared that this isn't going to work. Most marriages don't last. How can my completely screwed up situation work? I doubt anyone has been in my exact situation but some advice on how to proceed and how to make this work fluidly would be appreciated. I'm not sure of how traditional of a forum this is since its my first post but I swear I am a good guy even though my marriage situation may not make much sense. I've tried looking for guidance with people in open marriages but ours isn't really open. My wife and girlfriend aren't sleeping with other people and I'm not sleeping with anyone other than them. I never planned this out so I'm sort of just figuring things out on the fly.

1328628118.0,peqge,What’s the one aspect of poly you wish everyone knew about?,chiuxo,43,5,88,"(First

Now that’s out of the way

Is there a particular aspect of the poly lifestyle/ poly relationships you wish more people new about?  Or a false assumption lots of people seem to make, really, but especially if you’re in a long term relationship, or have children, or feel you can’t come out for whatever reason.

Just to explain a little more about the project: I'm actually making two pieces side by side.  Firstly, I am also making a much longer and broader piece more generally themed around changing modern attitudes to fidelity and monogamy, and as well as polyamorous people I also hope to speak to a range of other contributors (for example people who used 'married-cheating' dating websites, swingers, members of various religious organizations, etc).  I want to focus on the idea of ethics within non-monogamy, and particularly on the concept of long-term, as I think this is a really interesting angle which is not covered so often in the media.  I’ve also set up an interview with a marriage historian, but I thought it might help to know what kind of piece I’m aiming at.

Aaaaaand a little more about myself? OK, f, I’m actually in a monogamous relationship at the moment but polyamory is something I’ve felt an affiliation with ever since I first heard about it – I’ve felt something akin to compersion but had no word for it until recently.  Bit of a lightening bolt moment when I first saw it defined.  I’ve been working in radio for around three years, but came back to education last year to qualify as a ‘proper’ journalist.

ALL help and opinions very gratefully received!

The lead up:  I am a single male swinger in my mid 40’s.  I am on a popular swinging web site.  (SLS.)  I like sex with women and MF couples.  I got a random message on that site out of nowhere from a woman who liked what I said in my profile and wanted to meet me.  (SCORE!)  We exchanged some notes and then we talked on the phone and progressed to the next level.  We met for lunch.  We really did hit it off.  There was good chemistry between us.  She mentioned she had a regular partner who lives a good thousand miles away and that they meet about six times a year and that she keeps him in the loop on what she does sexually when he is not around.  She has been with him for about 4 years.  I had no problem with any of that.    

We met last night and had dinner before going to my place.  During dinner, how he gave her his permission to carry this out among other things.  We talked about limits, boundaries, likes and all of that.  When we decided to go to my place, she did mention she was going to call him and let him listen.  I was cool with that.  

In the bedroom.  Clothes off.  She calls him.  Speaker phone is on.  Him and I exchange the obligatory ‘what’s up bro’.  He acknowledged me with a smile in his voice.  He had a Southern

During our encounter

This really did happen and I am honestly not bragging.  I have observed the master/sub dynamics before.  But this is the most extreme I have ever seen.  Very little freaks me out as far as sex goes.  But this was more than a little bit strange to me.  

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

I realize

I had a ""date"" (hookup) with her last night. 

We'd flirted online all weekend long

We established in advance the logistics that I'd come over and she and I would hang out and maybe play for a while before he might arrive. At that point, since I know that's her kink.

Being with her was fantastic. It was my first experience with a woman, and we had a tremendous amount of fun.

He let her know he was coming over, but I had already been clear that this wasn't a FMF threesome. Really, more like a MF with a friendly third wheel.

Overall, and after a while, we all took a little break and I decided I would leave so they could have some alone time.

And for those who were concerned for my safety: I drank a sealed bottled water that I took with me even when I went to the bathroom so it was never unattended.

Later, or he's a really good liar. I've known him for 16 years and have never known him to lie about anything, including his emotions, so I'm going with ""not jealous."" But I continue to check his comfort levels as well as my own.

First some backstory. My wife and I met in the mid-90’s when we were both in high school. We did not live in the same state, even though it was still long distance, we were seeing each other at least once a month, and she lived  with me through the summers. 


Before college, and moved across the country to start our married lives. We were mostly happy, with a few small problems, but one thing was bigger than the rest: our sex life was not great. That is mostly my fault. I had reasons, including a lower libido from a bad diet and no exercise. I also watched too much porn, which I lied about. My wife wanted sex all the time, and that should have been great, which damaged her self esteem. She was wrong about that


As a result our relationship suffered. I wasn’t as supportive of her as I should have been


Skip to the end of last year. She had been reaching out to old friends on facebook to ease her loneliness. In the process, sending him photos (innocent ones at first). All the while she insisted that they were just friends. Based on her past of starting new relationships before ending current ones, I should have seen the writing on the wall and attempted to end it right away. But I could see that she was less lonely, and so I let it continue. At some point I got too uncomfortable with it and asked her to end it, and it led to one of the first conversations that truly showed how much trouble our marriage was in. 


She was unable to stop talking to him


The next blow occurred several months later when she attended a wedding in the same city that her ex lived in. I had just started a new job, and eventually she admitted she was considering leaving me, and she was going back to her ex to see if he was who she truly wanted. We fought, but it was clear that I had to let her go to him, otherwise she would probably have just left me then and there. She spent three weeks with him. I won’t go into details, but she decided to come back to me with the intention of giving us another chance. This was good news, but there was a looming deadline. This fall, but there has been so much damage to our relationship and trust that it has been hard to try and rebuild. The other obstacle was that she still talked to him daily


This past week we had another discussion about our relationship. I told her that she had to stop talking to him if she was serious about saving our marriage. She said she couldn’t. She had tried, but both he and I had laughed it off as insane. We discussed it, and she begged me to try it, just for a week. We both share common interests, and under different circumstances, we could be good friends. She said that even if I agreed to it, he would not likely go for it, she would know that I was more committed than he was


She set to the task of convincing him to come here to try it. At first he was as reluctant as I was, a normal relationship, and she is asking him to pick up and move here to share our lives in an arrangement that society considers anything but normal.  She was devastated, but not surprised at the result. She was obviously having difficulty taking no for an answer. She called him with me standing next to her, to ask him one last time. He wasn’t giving in. Finally, I asked if I could talk to him. She handed me the phone. We spoke for the first time, and it went very, this was the only way to make it work. I told her that it is possible that neither one of us could ever be enough for her by ourselves, other than maybe his dignity (which I was already giving up by having that conversation). I explained why I had agreed to it. That I loved my wife, it doesn’t at all). He finally agreed. 


This was two days ago. Since then, and for the first time I have hope that we can rebuild our relationship. But I am still scared out of my mind. What if it works? What if it doesn’t?


Now for my questions: Am I an idiot? Am I a foolish, but I wanted to get some advice from impartial (and anonymous) sources. 


TL:DR - My wife of 5 years had an affair and wants to have him move in with us as a second husband. I have agreed to test out this option to bring her happiness and save our relationship.

Have I just been spoiled up until now? Is it normal to 'close' your relationship for a while when you start dating someone new?**

I'll keep this as brief as possible

I've(20F) been with my fiancee(22M) for four years. We have lived together for three and a half years, although with his current time constraints he's not seeing anyone other than me.(Despite my best efforts, too.)

I also have a fledgling relationship with my boyfriend(21M). We've been officially dating for a week

Communication has been a bit of an issue between myself and my BF, think and come back with a complete answer. (Or, go away, play video games and put the question in the 'too hard' box.)

**Now that I've established the situation

I had a house party on Saturday, and it was never an issue with my fiancee. It becomes a bit of a joke about how many people I kiss at parties.

However, assuming = wrong move)
For clarity, just in case the opportunity arises.

So the other night, and he wasn't comfortable that we'd kissed. The next day we talked a bit more, and he said he also felt uncomfortable when I was affectionate with my fiancee and he was in the same room.*(This actually made me a bit angry, although I didn't react.)*

I talked with my fiancee about this, thought that my relationship with my boyfriend is still very young and he's probably just not entirely secure. That's perfectly understandable, and I can try to help him feel more secure. My fiancee thinks that my boyfriend has been in love with me for years and wants me all to himself. (My bf has definitely had at least a crush on me for a number of years)

Tonight I had a conversation with my boyfriend about my concerns. (After many 'maybes' and 'not sures') We ended up here:

* I can love my fiancee
* He can't compel me to change my promiscuous ways(Also how he put it)
* He's 'not sure' whether he's ok with me hooking up with people at parties
* He's 'not sure' whether he's ok with me possibly dating other people in the future

I think my fiancee was right

He and I are such good friends, but I wanted to be clear with my fiancee what options I had and what our five year plan might look like. True to form, my incredible fiancee and I ended up talking about the possibility of the three of us living together, and having children etc. My fiancee did not set any boundaries or constraints for my new relationship.

I want to address this head-on ASAP.

More than anything I just wanted to get this clearly written down, but when I put on my 'Realism Goggles' it's starting to look like the most likely course of action.

Edit: Although my bf and I have a sort of running joke about our imaginary future house &amp; I've made it clear that my fiance is a part of that dream

Edit/Update:

Ideally

Now here is my source of angst. Husband is completely straight

* No illegal shit.
* I need to know where you are going
* If you fuck on anything fabric in my house
* They need to know my ground rules.  

My only other ""request"" is that she and I have a way of contacting each other in case of an emergency involving my husband. Like

Now

* Wife can not date/fuck/play (kink-scene stuff) with anyone that has a penis

This includes dating people that are trans, where the ""waiters"" were naked partners of the female guests.  

Now, just as I trust that he would never break mine.  

I'm just struggling to come to terms with his OPP. We've spoken about it a few times

I'm pansexual to my core. I think humans are all just meat-suits with someone amazing inside. I don't care what they have between their legs or what their chromosomes say but he just can't look past it, thousands of dollars stolen from me, got kicked from my apartment, my cat stolen, lied too. Had girls that were making the first move suddenly ""stop"" being bi/gay and suddenly hate me. My mother is horrible to me, my grandmothers were both mentally unstable, my aunts are terrible human-beings, in any way they want because I will never matter to them as much as they matter to themselves.  

I realise that last paragraph is my own shit but the confusion and failure to comprehend ""half the population is off-limits to you because I'm not okay with extruding genitalia"" while I'm afraid of women. I trust men, I would love a girlfriend. And I'm trying to meet women. A woman.  

And this has been an issue. The ONE girl liked me back turned out to be a trans-woman. So naturally I had to tell the husband. ""Oh well, so that was a bullet dodged.)  

Sorry this got so long. I'm just deeply conflicted. I need people to talk to about this. In the end

**TLDR:** Husband says I ""can't date/fuck/play with anyone that has a penis, I feel confused, conflicted and resentful of his ""illogical""  and ""incomprehensible"" limitation. But I know I need to accept it, respect it and move on. I just need to talk this through with other poly's.

First off, and now I have that wisdom and will definitely take that into account if this ever comes up.

So today my boyfriend and I were discussing new sexual things we'd like to try at some point. After briefly discussing buttplugs, I would much rather deal with it in an honest and open way rather than possible cheating. I explained that when it comes to cheating, the dishonesty is what bothers me, not the actual sex. (FYI, cheating has never been an issue for us, but we're young and we want to be together forever so you never know.) He was actually really open minded to what I was saying and said that it is possible that he would consider some kind of threesome situation in the future if it seemed appropriate.

We discussed some details- decided it would probably go over better if we were involved with a woman rather than a man, which I think means that I wouldn't want to do it anytime soon and would need some more things discussed in great detail. However, I am simply thrilled- not necessarily because this threesome situation is more of a possiblity, but because we were able to have an open-minded and mostly comfortable conversation about it. I feel like it is a huge step forward in our relationship.

The currently critical and relevant truth on the table is that I'm polyfidelitous as a natural part of my orientation, and I've always kept my partners aware of each other's existence and their importance to me. At seventeen


My guy and I were amazing with each other from the start, as well, and nobody else was attracting me, so I was totally content. Over the next couple years, we got engaged, and the relationship only grew stronger. My best pal and I started really recognizing our feelings for each other, which was startling for me, and it took some real emotional introspection to figure out where she and I stand with each other. 


Then trouble in paradise: this winter, mostly because I still hadn't actualized to myself that *yes,* polyamory *is* integral to my identity, orientation, and sense of Self. Once I figured that out, I explained it to my partner in a pretty long e-mail, so that he could mull it over. My partner's way of expressing love is very one-person-focused, because I didn't really understand that it's more a reactive emotion
 

The e-mail sat unanswered for awhile, hoping it would go away.


Finally, him asking me really in-depth and earnest questions about what I want, how I feel, and how I love. Perceived-infidelity was something which, at one time, he would have considered a deal-breaker... but he valued me and our relationship too much to treat giving up on it as any remotely entertainable option: we're each other's truest mate, and we've both felt secure in that certainty for years, because the last thing he wants is for our relationship to become one-sided silent suffering while one of us defers to the other on everything. It's one of the hardest things he's ever had to do


We talked about my secondary and the new guy I'd recently started falling for. We talked about safety, he thought up ways that my spending time with my paramours could be a boon to our relationship, like how it would allow him more time for solitude and recovery from social fatigue (he's very introverted and needs a couple nights a week to himself normally) without me having to feel lonely or shut out from affection. 


Every question he asked was important and respectfully given,"" but as ""this will happen for certain, so let's talk about it, so we're on the same page."" Every step of the way, he supported my voice and my free agency, and he phrased things so that I could empathize with what he felt, as well. He earnestly gave me his blessing to pursue more contact and depth in my currently long-distance relationships with my paramours, expressing a wish that they would be accessible to me sooner than later. 


Two weeks ago, his consideration, and the selfless depth of his love for me.

My husband and I first became poly in 1999 when I fell in love with my best female friend. We ended up in a relationship with her and her husband that lasted approximately 4 years. It all blew up when my girlfriend decided that she could no longer deal with my now ex-husband because of various  personality clashes between the two of them. I was caught in the middle because I loved all 3 of them: the gf, it was becoming a big issue between he and I, so I ended things with them. 

A while later

So, born one year later, survived and thrived.

I raised her, I truly love that child and consider her my daughter still. 

I really had plans to raise her to adulthood along with my stepson and my daughter. It didn't turn out that way.

This brings me to why I wanted to share here. I kept the idea in the back of my mind and would mull over it sometimes and began thinking of it as a possibility and something I could see myself enjoying. I found this subreddit and began to read all these success stories and see how positive being polyamoruos has affected people. Also, being in a committed relationship I never really thought it would be something I would be exploring. With all that in mind I picked up a copy of Ethical Slut and really enjoyed it!

I brought all this up to my boyfriend and it was really amazing. Talking about polyamory brought us to a new level of communication. We decided to put all vulnerabilities on the table and talk about what we'd like about it

We started our journey slowly and dipped our toes into the water and a few times at small gatherings with close friends decided to allow one another to kiss others. Recently

It's so great getting to grow and experience a new chapters of my life with my boyfriend. Our communication has grown so much because of this decision we made together and it feels so wonderful being so open.

We have been together a little over two years; it’s been a tough, wonderful, and very learning experience at the same time. I wouldn't trade it for the world.

My biggest problem I guess is that our new girlfriend, isn't poly. Or at least, wasn't before she met us. She wasn't really anything.

This is not only her first time ever being with a girl, but her first time doing anything like this.

I keep imagining scenarios where she's leaving us, or going back through the entire last month to see if there's anything I did wrong or could have done better.

There are absolutely no problems in our relationship. She has communicated every worry she's had, and wanted to make things 'official' with us but didn't know how, it was adorable). There is no problem in time together, communication, or even other guys (the only other guys have been a poly friend of ours who when he realized we're in a closed triad backed off, and her ex who she never wants to be with again but is still friends with), yet my brain keeps going completely haywire about every single little thing expecting her to just up and leave us.

I've told her some of my worries, she was acting like everything was normal, completely affectionate and loving with the both of us, yet I kept getting distracted by trying to find some little *hint* of something going wrong, or something she might be hiding. I'm not sharing all of my anxieties with my girls as I realize that most of them are irrational, but at some point the dam is going to break and I'm going to have to do something about it.

One is moving down from CA to be with us and will be here next week.

I really love them both and want to spend the rest of my life with them. They're BFFs already and skype and goof around online all the time.  

The one who is already here is like my BFF too and we spend 24/7 together and goof around all the time!

 1. What do you do in public about PDA and holding hands?  I am worried about being judged by people.  My sister and niece seem to be putting out a lot of 'negative karma' about the idea when I ran it past them.  I had a similar situation to this before and guys would stare at us and women would give HARSH looks.  It was a short relationship though so I wasn't able to figure anything out about solving this.

 2. What about sleeping?  I'm going to buy a King bed.  Do you just sleep in a big cuddle puddle?  Two beds?  King doesn't seem big enough.

 3. Do you tell other people? I think we want to tell people that one is my GF and the other is a BFF.  I think society still judges people too harshly.  Part of this is that I'm 35 and they are 20 so there are other stereotypes going against us. I should clarify that people guess my age at 25 as I have good genes and I'm in very good shape.

Some people are totally cool about it.  I find that these are usually the people who have know other's who have been in poly relationships as well.  They understand that it's not something only Mormon's and Cult Leaders participate in (a comparison coming directly from a conversation I had with my mom - more on that in a minute).

Some of my favorite reactions include my little brother who responded with,"" and my good friend, ""yeah, a lot of people in this city (Portland) are into that.""  They then told me how happy they were for me and wished me luck.

The worst reaction came from my mom.  I only told her when she asked if I was ""seeing anyone at the moment"" (yes, but her concerns have made me very realize a lot about the misconceptions of poly.

Concern #1: That I don't have enough self esteem to think that any one person would be interested in just me exclusively.

Concern #2: People who are involved in poly tend to be involved in other ""weird stuff"" (this is where the Mormon's and Cult leader's comparison came in.  Also

Concern 3: This all comes from her and my dad getting a divorce when I was young and never choosing to date after they broke up.  Bisexuality and polyamory are not who I am but really just me wanting to be an close observer to a happy male female relationship so I can figure out how they work (implying that I really just want a ""normal"" hetro-mono relationship down the road).

It's incredibly frustrating.  I've responded to her concerns by saying: How can you think I have low self esteem when I have two wonderful people who care deeply about me and I can accept and embrace that?  Usually people with low self esteem have trouble thinking that one person can love them - I have two.  The second concern made me laugh more than the other two.  I really didn't know what to say other than ""no, Mormons or hippies.  We don't take obscene photos and plaster them on the internet.  Please, think of my personal judgement calls on my privacy to be about the same as when I was just dating men one at a time.""  However, third concern made me feel bad.  She ended up saying ""maybe this is all my fault"" because she didn't date after my dad and her split up.  It made me realize how she really feels that this is something negative and she is blaming herself for what she feels is an unhealthy choice.  I don't know what I can say or do to make her see that I am the happiest I've ever been and having more than one love can be as healthy (or as unhealthy, luckily in my case it's the former) as any monogamous relationship.  

Do you all have any advice on what I can do/say to show her this?  Maybe it will just take time and reassurance for her to see there is nothing wrong (and something very right) about relationships like this for me.  Also,False,self,t5_2qu5n,False,,,t3_vv8jq

Hi all. 
First I want to say this is an awesome community

I also apologise if this is long, on to the details;



So the situation is this, 26, straight) became interested in Polyamory just over a year ago. It started as a fascination of my wife's after discovering this subreddit, she started reading lots of posts and articles and became deeply interested in it. After a while she started talking to me about it and I became similarly interested, doing the same, reading up on it as an interest never seriously considering it. After a few months she started making lots of playful jokes about how it would be great to have a ""second"" wife, usually when we were being playful or having intimate time together, and by the summer of last year we were coming to the conclusion this was a lifestyle we wanted to try. However at the time we were expecting our baby

Fast forward to January, where as I was more open to just meeting people and seeing what happened (though would love a triad), however we initially started off ""unicorn hunting""... I'm sure I don't need to say this was fruitless. After a short while of no success we both agreed that we should start looking as individuals, so we setup profiles and started the delightful process of combing through OKC profiles :P both of us looking for girls (I should add initially I was only comfortable with the idea of her having a GF, but as time went on realised I was OK with her dating men too). We had no luck for a while.

In the meantime, as they have some history together but they hadn't seen each other for many years, though have always stayed in touch. We basically all hung around together all weekend, went out a few times, chilled drank and flirted which culminated at the end of the weekend in a threesome, which was awesome. We felt this was a great test of the waters, I felt a great sense of ""warmth"", seeing my wife being intimate with this girl

Back to the dating then, she was literally bombarded with messages within a day of changing her profiles ""looking for"", cracks me up!). She ends up chatting to a guy who is local and manages to arrange a date with him for a few days after I have arranged mine. I went on my date and it went better than I could have imagined, and to skip on details this girl and I have hit it off extremely quickly and have an extremely strong connection already, have had a second date and many more planned. Unfortunately my wife's date did not go well at all, there was no connection and she does not think she will see him again, which neither of us expected as he and her seemed to get on amazingly when texting and phoning. 

**So on to the issue;** Following from this, and because she hasn't got anyone else right now she is having to deal with all the hard parts by herself and has no one she can talk to about it, as she doesn't feel I can empathise. As a result I am feeling awful as well, I feel so awful that my happiness is causing her so much pain. I don't think either of us expected things to move so fast, but they have. We are also running into little issues with each new ""experience"" as I guess is normal, for example, this girl came to our house as my wife wanted to meet her as soon as possible, and my wife came away feeling neglected as she didn't get enough reassurance and affection from me. We deal with each of these things as they come up



**So I guess I want to know about anyone else's similar experiences

Thanks! 

*(Oh and as I'm sure it will be mentioned, but I have convinced her to start as it helped me a lot.)*

1328804347.0,phwlv,Polywhat?,matthew07,39,8,71,"Hello all.

The whole idea of polyamory is so strange and foreign to me I'd like to hear more about it. Normally I'd condemn somebody that said (s)he was in multiple relationships but this time I'll keep an open mind. I know it isn't for me since I am the jealous type and it would be hypocritical of me to pursue multiple women if my girlfriend can't. Things I'm wondering about is:

* Don't you get jealous?

* Do you expect your partners to have multiple relationships simultaneously as well? 

* Do you see yourself growing old with multiple partners or is this exclusively for your younger years?

I'm sure I can think of more later. I look forward to your responses!

EDIT: Good god, which is interesting, especially considering the fact that many of you don't expect your partner(s) to be polyamorous as well.

The true reason I asked you all about polyamory is because my best friend recently told/confessed to me he identified as such as well. He told me, thank you all so much.

My primary has started to notice.  He makes comments like, you're disgusted by me now,"" or ""I know you don't want me to touch you.""  He has also made comments like, ""Sorry I'm not ______ like _____"" (some attribute that my secondary has).  He says these things in a joking manner, but it's his way to let me know that he knows without coming out and saying it.  I try to deny it and pretty much force myself to have sex with him for the sake of our relationship.  We have children and he is a great father and husband so ending the relationship is not something I am willing to do at this point.


Has this happened to anyone else, but I feel like 2 years isn't really new any longer.

edit:  I wanted to thank everyone for their responses.  They have been extremely helpful.  I've come to the conclusion that this is most likely a reflection on how I feel about our relationship as a whole, so it couldn't hurt to try something else to see if it helps; 2) Sit down with my husband and come clean about my lack of desire, while doing my best not to bruise his ego; 3) Stop denying there's deeper problems and actually commit to doing the work on our relationship and communicating better.

I am a polyamorous girl

So far it's gone well, I really couldnt be bothered to lie - they knew about my bf already, but I had never mentioned my GF before. Questions ensued and to my amazement their reaction was really positive (things like ""omg, that's so cool"" or ""I wish I had the time"") and even had a few come out as being bisexual themselves. Which made me feel thrilled just to be able to be me... so I told my mum what I did (my mum knows, does not approve, but knows of my lifestyle). 

She did not react well. She was talking like I have just ruined my career and will never be respected - things like ""it's one thing to do it, university friends and work mates in part time jobs, but she thinks law is different. She is a lawyer herself so I suppose it just got to me.

I'm sure I took note of you even then.  You were attractive, flirted, and were openly friendly to each other.  At one time or another our brief foray in to the swinging scene came up.  We talked about how it turned out to not be at all what we expected and how we couldn't see ourselves with random strangers.

Maybe that is what first piqued your interest

Soem time after that you let it be known you were interested in us.  I can still clearly recall that first night.  My stomach was in knots all evening.  When I picked you all up after the concert there were sparks in the air.  Furtive glances and secret smiles.  There was just that pesky other person that had to leave us alone before we could play.

You feigned sleep until the coast was clear.  We lay in bed watching the clock.  When I heard you creeping down the hall, animalistic affair.  After some quiet talking and playful touching we went again in a slower, more sensual counter-part to our earlier frenzy.

I think we all approached that evening as a one-off, we were all wrong.  Over the next several months we were in almost constant contact during the day and you would come by when you were able.  Sometimes it was the equivalent of a three-way quickie, other times we'd lie in bed for hours talking, fucking, holding each other.

There were some deep emotional undercurrents about this time.  We had serious conversations about the poly lifestyle and what that meant for us.  I suppose that I had something of an epiphany one evening

As I lay on the bed, hugged you both, and told you my thoughts.

When you came home and talked about the show, and even copped a feel during the show like teenagers, my heart was huge with love.  I couldn't believe our fortune in finding each other and it working so perfectly.  I should have known better.

We knew you had a boyfriend.  We also knew you were keeping him in the dark about your ""affair"" with us.  That makes us complicit.  You two were on the outs, probably we just didn't care.  The positives of this arrangement were far outweighing the negatives, even accounting for karma.

A few months later

Your reasons, my rational side won out though and I was able to keep my shit together enough to keep a straight face as I wished you well.  My partner, however, was crushed.  She cried, like I have never seen her cry before.

We agreed in the beginning that, but it was hard.  Back at the same gatherings, broken inside and acting like we had not a care in the world.  I didn't realize it at the time, but you kept my heart on a string, dragging me around behind you on the hint of some future.  All lies.

It's been about two years since we split

Oddly, you hesitantly told me this.  I felt a bit raw about the whole deal but you're my friend.  I told you that we still loved and cared for you greatly and if this is something that makes you happy, you should go for it.  I was wrong, yet again.

This time is no different, however, by snatching the interests of someone already in the midst of a potentially budding relationship.  A member of your family and their spouse met someone.  Something has been going on there, even though you're not sure what.  Even with them professing their love for the new someone in *written word* you're still willing to sleep with that someone.

Several years ago I fell for a girl that was beautiful, deceitful, manipulative and cruel.  I find you emotionally toxic.  I rescind my blessing on your new relationship as I rescind my offer of friendship.

The idea of you will always have a place in my heart.  If the beautiful person you were ever lives again

Privilege might not be quite the right word here

Rules, especially during the early stages of opening up an existing relationship. Stop morally judging other people for not being saints of emotional stability. Human beings are not rationality-bots. Fixing insecurities is not easy, and many people struggling in life do not have the time and emotional energy available to do it.

If rules and hierarchies make the people in a couple or triad or whatever happy, then you’re *extremely entitled*. If the other members of an existing relationship value each other more than you, or value the feeling of (or actual) safety and security their set of rules or hierarchies provide more than you, that's perfectly within their right. Despite your feelings of entitlement to be on equal, non-hierarchical footing with them, they really don't owe you anything! Be grateful for the depth of relationships people are willing to give you and stop demanding more.

I'm not sure how to deal with it with my partner, and aside from this we have a very happy and fullfilling relationship but whenever I've ever even tried mentioning it to him he has completely shut it down, felt that it was selfish, completely non-understandable and things just eventually get to the point where they've boiled over after a while and eventually the argument ends with nothing resolved. 

I've cheated on him in the past and fessed up to it and apologized, etc., while in a relationship.

For more than a year I have felt that he is no longer putting energy into our relationship. I have raised the issue many times. I have asked that he stop actively trying to seek new partners and rather work on us. Not that we not be poly

He continued to spend hours every day finding new women to chat to and see if he could date. 

Our sex became more and more monotonous

I've been growing more and more unhappy

He then met another woman who he really likes. Queue end to any and all sexual interation with me - even stopped calling me my sexy nicknames and used them with her. 

What makes it harder is that I don't even know why he likes her - she is not very smart (he usually values intelligence), and comes across to me (and others who have met her) as immature. My ""crazy"" warning bells go off big time with her - she laughs proudly and jokes about very destructive manipulative behavious she employed in her last serious relationship. 

I expressed all this to my SO early on

I don't know what to do. I feel like he has not desired me sexually for a long time (I am in good shape, and has not come to the party to work on that. 

Now he's met someone new who he is very attracted to. Its even more hurtful that I just don't see what he sees in her. Maybe if they had lots in common it would be easier - it certainly was easier in the past when his interests were people I also liked. 

Is this it? Is my lifelong relationship and marriage over? I'm broken.... 

I've told all of this to him

He argues that this is just part of the whole ""poly people have their needs met by mutiple people"" thing. I get that, and he knows this, that its fine to get needs met outside IF we can't meet those needs. If I can meet those needs, then there's no need to find someone else for that. There's nothing I won't do for him sexually, so it really is just about me. If everything between us were really good and strong then yeah, sure have secondaries for even more, but right now I feel neglected and replaced rather than added to

How do I learn to just be ok with being in a sexless marriage and friendship?

We have always had a dynamic of me having a higher sexual appetite

I could accept that my partner just wasn't extremely sexually charged, and i was able to get a little extra on the side so i didn't feel crazy all the time, and that was great.

Now

The thing is
Even if we had sex the day before, when he's with someone other than me.

I realize, I wouldn't even be wasting your time, but I'm talking about random FWB, or mutual friends that sometimes end up part of group sex, so there isn't really a presence of a crush, just random hooking up.

I've seen him with these other women in sexual situations and his energy and interest is way higher than it is with me. 
He gets really into. There's grunting and hair pulling and ass slapping... great awesome enthusiastic sex. The kind of sex I wish we were having.

I feel like he has no passion for me. I feel like I've been misled into believing that he has a low sex drive

I try hard to get his attention... I flirt, but even after 4,5,6 days of not having sex, I can barely turn his head. 
I try ignoring him and not initiating sex, but he doesn't even notice, and eventually i get fed up of waiting and just initiate, which is often rejected, making me feel all that much worse.

I am not unattractive. In fact, happy individual. I am in good shape, I take care of my self, and I'm always very enthusiastic and giving in bed.

We've talked about ways to improve his low sex drive, coming up with kinky things we can do together...
I've mentioned many times that maybe talking to a doctor to make sure everything is fine there

I don't want to feel insecure and like he enjoys having sex with other people more than he does with me

I've been bisexual as far as I can remember

We met a woman in our social circle who is poly.  She was interested in both my husband and I and it opened our eyes and minds to the possibilities in polyamory.  He found some awesome articles in this subreddit (thanks everyone that participates here!) which helped a lot.  Unfortunately things went way too fast and when we tried to back off it wasn't taken well.  Which of course led to it ending.

The icing on the cake in all of this lies with some other friends who are poly but we didn't even REALIZE were interested in us.  We hadn't even considered it because the pairing would be completely hetero but
