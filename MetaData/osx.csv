A lot of power users complain that Mission Control is not like Spaces.  Let me make a few specific points and suggestions.  Multiple displays are effectively broken with Mission Control.  The following three points are the most serious

- Mission Control shows each display's desktop icon on its own screen, perhaps only on the main display or perhaps duplicated on both displays so that both displays are effectively clones in Mission Control.  This is the single biggest failing of Mission Control and you should take this recommendation seriously.  10.7 is too old and has undergone too many revisions at this point for this design to have continued for so long.

- Mission Control is incompatible with reassigning windows across the multi-display divide.  The user-interaction almost works.  One can drag a window to the other display and even ""shrink"" it into one of the desktop icons at the top, the correct fix is to leave the interaction alone (it works fine) and actually support the underlying window-to-desktop reassignment.

- Spaces permitted one to drag window icons from one space to another.  Mission Control only allows this from the current desktop to other desktops.  There is no way to move window icons from the desktops out to the current desktop display

- Lastly

I sincerely hope you will take this matter seriously.  Considering how old 10.7 is

Thank you.

Installation is modular so you can install just what you like.

Also you can find themes for last iTunes version.

Also I recommend to check Gpopper blog where you can find other wonderful gems for changing osx appearance like this pale background for Notes App that I love

I'm especially confounded because I run the exact same stuff on my Linux desktop at home

So I followed this guide:

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4897066?start=0&amp;tstart=0

You'll need a windows 7 disc.

If that guide's down

**================ START  MIRROR ================**

* Gather your Windows 8 install disc AND a Windows 7 install disc (you can surely find one by searching the net, NOT 7, this is just for my trick to fool bootcamp assistant and no i do not condone piracy)
* Inside BootCamp Assistant, twice..could be heavy usage due to the popular new update...so i recommend downloading it faster, and manually here http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macoscomponents  and get 4.1.4586  yes this is for windows 7, ALSO while you are there, download the windows 8 support pack 5.0.5033, as we will need that later as well.  As a matter of fact, DO IT THIS WAY and dont bother
* That being said and done, leaving the download support software unchecked
* Partition your hard drive as youd like, and obviously give that one more room, i.e you do all your Photoshop work, and app development in OSX, and only use Windows for office stuff, you'd want to give yourself more room on the OSX side.  I however bought a huge new internal drive to split them basically in half, as i use them both frequently.
* This step is where the trick comes.  OSX 10.8.3 / BootCamp will advise you there is no support for Windows 8..only 7 with your Mid 09 Macbook Pro if you have put your Windows 8 disc in, why they excluded this model i have no idea...im sure they had reasons, but i dont care at the moment..lol

* INSTEAD place a Windows 7 install disc in
* Let it do its thing
* Click the ""x"" to close the installation for Windows 7

* **IMPORTANT**  Once you hear the beloved Mac chime
* This brings you to an area where you can select a startup disk.  At this point
* You now, and the Recovery Disk. 
* Insert your Windows 8 install disc

* Now WAIT.  Eventually, but you cant miss the new entry)
* This is where a wired mouse will be needed
* You are now in Windows 8's installation interface
* Follow the steps until it asks you where you want to install it.  You should see a partition about equal to what you set earlier in BootCamp Assistant

* OH NO, and click format.  I cant remember, but i think you have to click ""options"" to get to a the spot where you can format it.  Pretty straight forward.  Safety check, obviously make sure you have the Bootcamp partition selected, dont format your Mac OSX partition!
* After the quick format is done
* Go through the whole Windows 8 install, and im not covering that, as its a hand in hand walkthrough like any other install.

* Once your inside your new Windows 8, no on screen displays for brigtness, volume, and possibly other stuff.  Not cool right? 
* Grab your USB stick
* FIRST open the Windows 7 Bootcamp install
* It takes a while, and eventually restart your MBP, which is cool, let it do it.

* Upon finishing
* Big Thanks to a post by ErikVanD i seen on this forum for the next step.
* If you want, something awful to that nature.  Awww man, this far, only to get let down.  Nope.  We are going to fix that.  And this is where ErikVanD's post pointed me to what we do next.

* It was said to navigate in the BootCamp 5.0.5033 folder to something of the effect of BootCamp/Drivers/Apple and run the MSI file ""BootCamp""  (MSI file will say Windows Installer in its description, but mine gave me an error say it ""needs elevated permissions to run, use setup.exe instead.  We tried that remember!  And it gave us the x64 not supported error.  Oh man!  Blabbing aside, this file needs to be ran as an administrator, which yeah your the only user, but Windows is funny like that.  Normally youd just right click, and select run as administrator, that option isnt there when you right click, you need to add a registry file to enable running as an administrator

* Open notepad in Windows
* Paste this following code into the new doc 


    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  


    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\Shell\runas] ""HasLUAShield""=""""    

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\shell\runas\Command] @=hex(2):22,00,53,00,79,00,73,74,6d,6f


* Or download the file already made from my company server at http://www.theprojectdev.com/public/pub.html  **i put this there as a courtesy to help others like me, put it on your desktop.

* Now double click the new registry file
* Once done, your choice.
* Guess What!?  Now we can do the impossible!  Lets revisit that solution from before by going to the newest BootCamp 5.0.5033, we now have an option to ""Run as Administrator""  Click that option.

* WooHoo!  We have done what coudnt be done
* After the update, navigate to the system tray icon on the bottom right corner of the screen (little up arrow) and click it.  It will pop up a little menu, showing system processes/stuff running, click the gray squared diamond (this is bootcamp) and it will bring up the newest BootCamp control panel.  From here, you can nav to trackpad/touchpad and set tap to click (finally) and gestures, etc.  This control panel has lots of good stuff to make a MBP user feel comfortable in Windows 8.  There you go!  You did it!

 really, and so much more, it really works great.  I upgraded my hard drive to 1tb, and installed 8gb of PNY RAM from best buy ($40) and it runs Windows 8, AND OSX fantastically.

Power Nap for Mac OS X Mountain Lion is a neat feature. When the laptop is in sleep mode, contacts, reminders, notes, and documents pushed to iCloud.​ It even updates software downloaded from the Mac App Store and backs up the mac using TIme Machine. But why stop there? With a dedicated API and access to Power Nap, third parties can use this amazing feature to further close the gap between the desktop and the internet.

Take ​Dropbox, they can't receive the photos until they log into the computers and wait for the files to download. I encounter the same problem when i transfer movies from my PC to my Air to watch in another room.

If dropbox could use Power Nap, too simple. Also, I can't just upload my pictures from my DSLR to my's Photo Stream.

The same feature can work with Steam (to sync game files and keep the games up to date), ​and Twitter (to keep twitter in sync). Further, for those who don't use default clients and like third party software like Fantastical, this feature can give the same advantage to these developers.

These are just some ways app developers can take advantage of Power Nap. An always up to date Mac makes for a much better computer experience knowing that you don't have to wait around for your mac to update when it connects to the internet. Some people might say it only takes a couple minutes to update these files, and Contacts. Also, because their might be multiple changes, it would be faster and more efficient to allow the macs to update while asleep.

Power Nap has untapped potential. By allowing third parties to use Power Nap,False,,t5_2qh3j,False,,,t3_zbdsp

* use the matrox dual head to split the display port into 2 DVI signals (apparently powerdesk from matrox does a decent job of handling the single virtual display across two monitors)
* use a dual DVI card graphics card on the PC with DVI to HDMI adapters to connect to the monitors

~~switching the dongle~~ (i can use synergy for that) and source input on the monitors is a pain

I finally got fed up with Safari slowing down the CPU to 10mhz every time a GIF was loaded.

Camino seems to be an alright.

What I love:
     GIFs play at normal speed and don't crash
     You can save videos (ie http://website.com/movie.mp4) by right clicking on them. Safari disables it for some reason
     ""Add to iPhoto library"" is not there to accidently be clicked on when right clicking to save images
     Importing Safari bookmarks/passwords was easy
     Bookmarks bar is smaller and tidied up
     Managing bookmarks is easier. I don't know why Apple wants to 'beautify' managing bookmarks.
     Less memory leaks when compared to Safari
What I don't like:
     holding ⌘ and clicking something opens a new tab
     safari/chrome/webkit have 'Developer Tools' (option+⌘+i). Camino doesn't
     Right-click save as always brings the downloads window to the front (there's no way to prevent this). It's annoying when saving multiple things.

I'm looking at replacing my Core Duo Mini (snow leopard) and Core 2 duo Win7 machine with a single Mid-2011 Core i5 mini w/16gb.

On OSX I do Adobe Creative Suite3 work.  On Win7 I do MS Office and streaming video/podcasting.  This was more a matter of licenses than preference although I'm now pretty set in my ways..

I am quite familiar with dual-boot and understand the basics of it.
I know that video podcasting won't run well under virtualization.

I have no license for Adobe CS in Windows.

I pretty much have 4 problems. The first is running out of ram. With no apps running at all

The second problem is running out of disk space. It seems something is leaking memory to disk, but I don't get it all back until I restart. Yesterday I went from Zero KB avail with everything open to just over 5GB free after rebooting.

The third problem I think is caused by the first two. Every so often, and just fails miserably at coping with this. Sometimes it pops up a window saying I must kill open apps to free up memory, but not all the time. Sometimes this window pauses a process, and there's no way I can figure out how to unpause it (tried clicking resume, tried freeze frame and tried the command line, but can't remember what command). All of this is a bit annoying, and I plan to reformat and reinstall when Lion comes out.

TThe last problem though, my keyboard just stops working. I can still option click finder to relaunch it, and if I open the keyboard viewer and press keys, it shows them as being pressed. However, if I go to finder, or chrome, or any place I can enter text, or put the computer to sleep and wake it up (which can be difficult to do in certain circumstances.

I upgraded recently from Snow Leopard. I upgraded because of the hype, except for one thing - EXPOSE.

I really dislike Mission Control. For one, Expose and Spaces. Second - Expose is dead. Long live Expose. The ""Expose"" in Mission Control is not the Expose that Steve Jobs WOW'ed everyone in in his reveal of it in his famous keynote of OS X Panther. He described Expose as the ""beautiful function that shows all your windows no matter how many you have so you don't have to fumble or wonder which app has which window open."" Mountain Lion took a knife and plunged it into Expose, the feature that made me fall in love with OS X.. It's really difficult to use OS X right now, when I cannot see which windows I have open, because the dock tells me I have it open, but nothing I do shows me said windows, unless I manually search for it. Why? Why does it have to be like this?

Don't get me wrong.. I really like Mountain Lion so far, and at the same time, I have tutorial videos, I have many Photoshop images open, I have web pages (though they are tabbed), and I have chat clients. Everyone's expectation of Mission Control is to show ALL OPEN WINDOWS despite their minimized status. It does not do this. 

I apologize I ranted a bit to describe my point. So what can an individual actually do to have real Expose back?",,t5_2qh3j,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/11it7f/the_woes_of_mission_control_rant/

I don't speak a lot of Mac, V2V etc and versus dual-booting.  I've attempted to P2V my existing Win7 64bit Enterprise edition within Fusion, but it fails with an error code that can mean many things. Tried looking in support databases for help and calling a buddy that P2Vs for a living, but none of the suggested plans of action worked for me.  So I'm cutting my losses and it's time for plan B, meaning not using the VMWare product on my Mac.

As I understand it, as they all talk about installing Win7 from scratch first.  Yet, I've seen reference to migrating an existing Win7 platform into Parallels.

So my question is: how do I P2V my existing Win7 world into Parallels in such a way that I can still work with it via Bootcamp and use the same data set no matter if I'm running via dual-boot or within a VM?

1369552876.0,1f2mbz,How I've grown to hate OS X after a period of about nine months.,davrukin,2,6,16,"I got my 13"" 2012 Base MacBook Pro in about August of last year for school. I have always wanted a Mac and had even installed software to make my PC look like OS X (FlyAKite OSX, and all still do; I'm the only one with a Mac. I like the way the computer looks but Mountain Lion is simply the worst operating system I have ever used

About a month after I got my Mac, the brand new mac had another hard drive crash, which they replaced (all for free), however with no compensation (I was hoping for a free iPod Touch, but wasn't expecting one). So far, I haven't had any mechanical problems (knock on wood), although my second Mac's hard drive seems to be slightly louder. 

I installed Windows last year so I could play some of the games I like and run some PC software natively

The following is a list of what bothers me:

* Waking up from sleep takes 2 minutes from the time I open my lid to the time I can finish logging in
* Falling asleep takes just as long (Windows does it instantly)
* Logging in from a shut-down or restart takes at least 5 minutes until I can open a program
* Memory usage is incredibly inefficient. I can have one window of any browser with five tabs
* ""Inactive RAM"" is a complete mystery and why it doesn't get cleaned even if I use the *sudo purge* command.
* Windows 8 lets me run ten tabs each in three windows with multiple instances of OpenOffice and five Metro apps with no hiccup
* The computer wakes up from sleep when I unplug it from power

These are just some of the annoyances, respectively, one harking back to the days of Windows ME and the other working like a computer should.
