But how do I start? What should I do? Here's a guide on not the answer to physics problems

First off, or theta for an angle. Convert funky units into units you are familiar with or are consistant with the rest of the problem. Make sure you try to understand the units on each value given. Try to associate these values with the physical things you've seen in labs.

Then as yourself, although correct, wit the right form, significant digits, or units. Understanding your goal is key.

The final step is to find ways to link from what you have to what you want to get. This is what solving physics problems is all about. Try different methods of finding the answer. Is there a formula you can simply use? How many unknowns do we have? Is this problem similar to any example problem that you've seen? Can we set up a system of equations? Write down equations that you think may be relevant to the problem and see what you can get from there. 

If you still can't get a solution, and neither should you. However, you should do your best to try things out until you've exhausted your ideas. If you still can't figure it out, skip the problem and come back to it later. You may solve a similar problem later or be reminded of another trick that you can use on later problems.

Finally, which means basically a quick mental math of whether your answer is in a physical ball park. If a baseball is flying at 10^9 m/s, it is traveling faster than the speed of light. If a cow ends up weighing 45 grams, you made a mistake in your calculations. Also make sure that your units match up to the units the problem asked for. Never forget to stop and think about the problem you just solved.

Find the volume between the two parabaloids x = y^2 + z^2 and y = x^2 + z^2

Hint: x - y divides x^2 - y^2

I thought...

Set z = 0 to find the ""shadow"" in the xy plane: y = x^0.5 and y = x^2

They intersect at (0

x^2 = x^0.5

x2 - x0.5 = 0

x^(0.5)(x^1.5 - 1) = 0

x^0.5 = 0 gives x = 0 and y = 0 and

x^1.5 - 1 = 0

x^1.5 = 1 gives x = 1 and y =1

I think I understood up until now

∫∫∫ 1 dzdydx where 0≤x≤1

THIS IS A SPEECH FOR MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASSS. NOT A HISTORY CLASS. I know my scenarios are implausible. ",2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/18mf85/i_wrote_a_speech_on_4_scenarios_in_which_the/,"Today, I would like to discuss with you folks a twist on everybody’s favorite history lesson: The second world war, and the rise and fall of the third reich. Your average joe with a high school diploma can give you the long and short of what DID happen, this question alone isn’t enough to use

Scenario one: The Zimmerman Telegram

The Zimmerman Telegram was a document sent from Germany to Mexico during WWI, Mexico declined. But what if they accepted a similar proposal during WWII? Japan would have been able to use Mexico as a launchpad to assist in the invasion. America is too busy defending their homeland to assist in Europe, and Europe falls to the Axis powers. Germany would be relatively unable to assist, as this war would do nothing to defortify the Eastern coast of America. Thus, America is pushed back to the East, all the way to the Mississippi. 

War is all about who you know, with its entire population crammed into half of its previous area, would quickly become plagued by overpopulation and lose its superpower status near the turn of the millennium. People would quickly get it in their heads to emigrate en masse, but put simply they’d have few places to flee.

Scenario two. 
Germany doesn’t make its fatal mistake of betraying Russia

 Britain would have been too busy defending their homefront to contribute in Africa, and the Nazis win the war. What does this mean for Europe? 

Mainly it means prime trading partners for the US – A triangle between the Axis powers, the world’s first assault rifle – a term coined by Hitler, little known fact – and the much-coveted Russian gun, the PPSH. The ability to quickly change magazines when your enemy  could not be overestimated.

Eventually, Russia and Germany would see open war. This is even better news to America, as we would be selling munitions to both sides in what is likely (given the Russian terrain the Nazi blitzkrieg style of warfare) a very long and drawn out war.
Scenario three:

 What if Britain had joined the Axis instead of the allies

France would have fallen without British there to help them against the multinational attack, so too is this one: Today Africa – at least certain parts and peoples - would be much better off. The apartheid would be less severe, if Germany had any interest in their colonialism paying off for the homeland and so-called master race. Warlords wouldn’t make the rules, and the primitive, uncivilized tribes would have been assimilated or annihilated under fascist regime – This would mean today far less famine, and little to no AIDS epidemic. This is also the most sustainable model for Germany, as the amazing natural resources of their newly acquired continent coupled with their technological capabilities to harvest and transport those resources could offer Germany an economy that has real stability that isn’t seen in other options.

Fourth and final scenario: Hitler acquires nuclear weaponry before 
anybody else.

Towards the end of the war

However, despite its disadvantageous geographical distribution of its populace – most likely in Stalingrad. This would have very likely inspired a hasty Russian surrender.
Seeing the massive destruction brought on by nuclear weaponry

That is my take on what the world would look like following various methods of the success of the National Socialist German Worker’s party. Though highly theoretical and speculative in nature

For example

In return for such a huge and kindly favour I'd be more than happy to write something for you

If at all possible it'd be great if the image could be at least 300 dpi.

In advance

The copy that I've written follows.

*The Generics are a sensation. Rising from complete obscurity to pant-wettingly famous in a matter of weeks must have shaken their humble, as they grew up in those conditions. They have been compared to The Arctic Monkeys, The Kaiser Chiefs, The Wombats, The Rakes, The View and countless other successful bands that start with ‘The’. With an entirely different and not at all copied sound, The Generics are set to become the biggest band in the world. It is rumoured that they have been offered a headline slot at Glastonbury next year and they have been given a multi-record deal by industry giants EMI. Front man Johnny was even given a top-ten spot on the NME cool list this year; quite an honour by all accounts. I met the band during their ongoing and extensive UK tour.

Johnny Guitar is a rockstar, he has a tremendous presence, seemingly drawing energy from nowhere and making the crowd hang on his every word. “Well, you know, like, it’s part of the job man,” he explains as he lights a cigarette and slouches further into the cheap plastic chair he is sitting on. “Sometimes you don’t want to do it but, the fans have paid to come and see us

Billy Bass is a cool,” he says respectfully. “I like being on tour and everything but I miss my girlfriend too much.” With a preference for jazz music and classic novels he is often left out of the partying that goes on: “I don’t really mind it, I don’t have that much in common with the other guys and I’m not into the whole lifestyle.” Billy, as the chief songwriter, claims to draw influences from a variety of sources; “I really like The Blands, The Sames and Crappy Boring Indie Music for Dumb People.” A list of bands that, to me at least, but I’m assured by Billy that they are all original and groundbreaking in their own way.

Pete Otherguitar is quiet, and I’ve never been much of a lyricist.” Apparently, this shy front seems to fade after several drinks and from talking to the other band members, I discovered some quite shocking stories. I won’t go into detail as I fear he may suffer legal repercussions if I do, but let’s just say one night he got up to some drunken shenanigans that included a zoo, sixteen chimpanzees and a bowl of custard.

David Drums is an interesting character. A man the size of two houses and arms the size of buses, include drumming, playing the drums, and doing other drum things. This is a guy that is completely dedicated to his art and it really shows through. After trying unsuccessfully to coax him into a conversation, I was informed by a passing roadie that he has taken a vow of silence, but nobody really seems to know why. Some might say this is pretentious and irritating, but not anyone that values their life. The guy is terrifying.*

I'm pretty sure that he is just saying that metacognition is a useful human ability that enables us to overcome flaws in our natural thinking process. Am I on the right track?

Here is my paper: 

My Paper

Jonah Lehrer presents a very interesting and unique take on metacognition in his paper, and bewildering at times is a very practical and important ability that is all too often underestimated. Lehrer attempts to strengthen his claim by providing the reader with pieces of  key information which include a study by Philip Tetlock and his study on experts analyzing their ability to make accurate predictions about future events, a series of experiments conducted by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on people's reactions to the framing of gambling games, and our inability to avoid thinking about white bears when specifically told not to.
	
First Lehrer introduces the act of metacognition to the reader by giving them a simple command: “Don't think about white bears.” The reader inherently fails because in the process of concentrating on not thinking about white bears the brain analyzes the current thought process sees the word white bears and the image of white bears is suddenly at the forefront of the readers mind again. This never-ending loop of goals and mental review checkpoints is what Lehrer sees as an “essential feature of the human mind” for which the technical term is metacognition. Metacognition is basically the ability to be self-aware in that we humans think about how we are currently thinking. Lehrer goes on to argue that without metacognition humans would make a much greater number of mistakes and would be on the whole less intelligent without metacognition.
	
One of the key pieces of evidence that Lehrer uses in making this argument is a study by Philip Tetlock. Tetlock found that the experts who had the most success were the ones who “reflected on their own thought processes” allowing them to weed out mistakes and arrive at a more accurate and soundproof conclusion. Lehrer uses Tetlock's study to point out that what allows a person to truly excel in their field of work is their ability to analyze their own thoughts
	
He then points out that by essentially proofreading one's thoughts an individual can catch themselves from making mistakes that other's would normally fall prey to such as loss aversion, but if people stop and take a moment to reflect upon their thoughts and how they arrived at them they could easily stop themselves from making poor choices.

**My Reflection:**
Henry James attempts to articulate the flaws of perceiving criticism as negative. He endeavours to do so because of people's over-indulging senses of entitlement. According to James, he can comment on ways to achieve improvement for future instances. Henry James also philosophizes to accept the critiqued material as one's own. By accepting it as so, one promotes further criticism on himself and on the work recently critiqued. Since blatant denigration is often accompanied by negative connotations and an offensive tone, such a philosophy gives humans an evolutionary promise to improve.

Sometimes it comes to a point where that black room is filled to the edges
And I am imploding. 
I am breaking myself against the wall I made to keep that something away from me. 
But what I really did was keeping me out from myself.
And alone in there it has more control over me than I dare to admit.
But how do you tell someone
It took me forward in times anyone would have backed down. 
It shaped me into a remarkable person. 
It taught me about love. 
And it taught me about hatred. 
But most of all it taught me that we can all be monsters in times when we have to defend ourselves or someone we love.
This something taught me what true freedom is
I’m a good person. 
I have never done anything to intentionally hurt anyone. 
Yet I’m a monster. 
Not in your eyes
I have made choices in my life and maybe they were going to turn out right. But the right way for me have always been the wrong way for someone else. Maybe someone who isn’t that close
Something that I need
Maybe it isn’t right. Maybe that someone
Maybe I’ve done wrong. 
Maybe I shouldn’t have risked my own well-being and my relation to everyone I loved just to save those two small someones
Yet I did those things. 
Why? 
Because people live by chance. They wait for something greater to happen, so they let it pass. 
I can’t do that. 
I spent many years of my life with medication. Years which I can’t even remember
His smile at the breakfast table
Her tanned face
Their laughter’s in their bedroom when I sneaked by
And the dog, the only place he slept was there.
And the neighbors kids. I knitted hats for them all. 
Until that one day when they we’re all gone. 
And that one day I became a monster because it was easier to face something dark with darkness itself
That something inside of me
But I can feel it growing, somehow I will let it out,
And there will be joy again. 
I was a monster
And I’m a human
I’m Maya
And I can finally feel it

**Question 1**: I normally just plug and chug for problems like these (although I'm sure there's a better method I don't know of) but I am confused at how they derived the final answer of B. It seems like f(-x) swaps the sign and order of the domain but I don't have the intuition why.

x^2 - 2x + 1 &lt; 1


(x-1)^2 &lt; 1


x-1 &lt; 1


x &lt; 2

**Question 3**: cos(theta) = cos(1) ... not sure why theta doesn't just equal 1. Completely confused by this one. The actual answer is 5.28.

**Question 4**: Option ""I"" seems to be correct because if x=0 there will be division by zero and thus a vertical asymptote there. I don't know how to find out about the other two-especially ""III"". Can anyone help me with finding minima and maxima for equations like these (quadratic?)?

and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. 
This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;--it is a mean
or compromise
and not be punished
without the power of retaliation; and justice
between the two,
and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. 
For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such
an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. 
Such is the received account
of justice.



   Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because
they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we
imagine something of this kind: having given both to the just
and the unjust power to do what they will
whither desire will lead them; then we shall discover in the very
act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road
following their interest
and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law. 


The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely
given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have
been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. 

According to the tradition
of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm
an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. 

Amazed at the sight,
among other marvels,
at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature
as appeared to him
gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended. 

Now the shepherds met together
might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king;
into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger
was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside
his hand
and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. 

He was astonished at this
the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring
and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he
became invisible
to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court;
where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen
conspired against the king and slew him

Suppose now that there were two such magic rings
on one of them and the unjust the other;
to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. 

No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could
safely take what he liked out of the market
and lie with any one at his pleasure
whom he would

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust;
they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may
truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just
or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually
but of necessity
be unjust
that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice
and he who argues as I have been supposing

If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible
and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's
be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot
would praise him to one another's faces
with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. 

Enough of this.

**The problem statement

&gt;Paul consumes only two goods, as shown by his utility function: U(P, H) = P + 4H. The price of pizza is $3 and the price of hamburgers is $6, and Paul’s monthly income is $300. Knowing that he likes pizza, Paul’s grandmother gives him a birthday gift certificate of $60 redeemable only at Pizza Hut. Though Paul is happy to get this gift, his grandmother did not realize that she could have made him exactly as happy by spending far less than she did. How much would she have needed to give him in cash to make him just as well of as with the gift certificate?

**Relevant equations**

**The attempt at a solution**

Paul can buy 20 pizzas with that gift certificate. I assume that the rest 300$ he will spend on hamburgers which cost 6$,50) the utility he gets is U(20,50)=20+4*50=220. Now, If my reasoning up to this step has been right, I need to figure out another bundle (P,H) which will get as much utility for Paul.

I'm doing a masters year course in Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation.

I feel I should give the question and then what I worked as the solution (so far) and if there are any discrepancies

So
A single-phase transformer has 480 turns on the primary and 90 turns on the secondary. The mean length of the flux path in the iron core is 1.8m and the joints in the magnetic circuit are equivalent to an airgap of 0.1mm. If the maximum flux density is to be 1.1T when a p.d. of 2

a) The cross sectional area of the core
b) The secondary voltage on the no-load
c) The primary current and power factor on no load.

Assume the relative permeability of the iron core is 2
My answers thus far:


Φ = Flux  V1 = 2

a) 
Φ = V/(4.44.f.N1) = 2

Area A = Φ/B = 20.6*10^-3 /1.1 = 0.0187 m^2

b) (This is the one that does not sit right with me

V2 = V1*(N2/N1) = 412.5V

(But also working out this way also tends to make me think that it is correct:)

V2 = 4.44.f.N2.Φ = 411.588V 

(But less accurate as I have to take into account for the flux not being exact. The calculation could also just be cancelled down so that you are just left with the V2.)

Insects, and the relationship between wavelengths that a butterfly sees (*B*) and *h* is given by the equation 37 (*B* + 100) = 39 *h* + 350. Give the ranges of wavelengths visible to bees and butterflies. Which (humans, bees, or butterflies) has the greatest visible spectrum? What colors can humans see that bees cannot see? What colors can butterflies see that bees cannot see (you might give a wavelength range for this answer)? FYI: many flowers have ultra-violet markers to attract bees and assist them in finding the pollen! [[Source](http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/compositor)]

1345107122.0,yb8qu,Statistics problem,Bluedemonfox,6,1,4,"Hi

Eg. Two Random samples of size 400 and 450 were taken from population X and Y respectively. These samples were taken to analyze the daily calorie intake. From the first population X

i) Calculate the 99% confidence interval for the true difference of the two means.


Now I don't understand how he tells to assume they have equal variances but he gives me 2 different standard deviations. And I am uncertain how I should proceed :(



EDIT: What I tried working it out so far but I am not sure I worked it correctly.


So I think I would have to use the equation z = [(X1-X2) - Ux2-x2]/σx1-x2

Were X1 and X2 are the sample mean of X and Y respectively

Ux2-x2 = the mean difference of the populations X and Y (U1-U2) which is the mean difference of the sampling distribution.

σx1-x2 is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution found with [σx1-x2]^2= [(σ1)^2/n1] + [(σ2)^2/n2] with n being the sample size take from each population.

Now from 99% confidence I found the z value to be 2.575 (found from the table) and since graph is symmetrical you get +/-.

So I get:  

           -2.575 &lt; z &lt; 2.575

           -2.575 &lt; [(X1-X2) - Ux2-x2]/σx1-x2 &lt; 2.575

               69 &lt; (X1-X2) &lt; 131

And so I got that range for (X1-X2) but I am still not sure if this is correct since X1-X2 is the mean difference of the samples which is not very accurate and he asked for the true difference between the means right? I am reasoning wrong because I just feel like I am doing something wrong.

Freud explained all of this very clearly in his psychosocial analysis when he stated that man was made up of three parts (Id, and superego. By nature, man already has id as his or hers dominate mindset, worrying about things like survival, sex, and every other animalistic act that is necessary for his or her own pleasure. The id side of survival is not worried about what others think, and may even act evil to get where he needs to go. Id may even help someone or something because it is necessary for their survival. 

Even though id may seem “bad” in man’s eyes, greedy, and animalistic.

The tendency to want to meet both peoples need is called “superego” (Id, and less shunned, by society (Erikson’s Psychosocial). Superego is not “good” or “evil” however, he and id both just do what they believe is best. Superego just does it in a way where both parties can benefit more often than not.

Now if one is not born evil, than eventually he or she will only try to outcast others and make them feel what he or she feels (Erikson’s Psychosocial). So while man by nature is selfish, he is not evil, he is not even good. He just does not have the sympathy needed to worry about others and decide on a better solution than the first thought that came into his head.

You can expand (n-1)! to be equal to n!/(n) and in much the same way

You also can simplify ((n-2)-(n-4))! to be 2! because the inside is just algebra.

My work:  
(n!)/84 = ((n-2)!)/(((n-2)-(n-4))!)  
(n!)/84 = ((n)!)/((n)(n-1))((n-2)-(n-4))!)  
(n!)/84 = ((n)!)/((n)(n-1)(2!))  
1/84 = 1/(2(n)(n-1))

42 = n(n-1)

n^2 - n - 42 = 0

1318292047.0,l7oh5,English essay Beowulf vs Gawain and the Green Knight. Can anybody proof read 2-3 pages for me?,DrGsEnglishstudent,7,1,0,"What is expected from the average Scandinavian soldier at the time Beowulf was first conceived, Beowulf explains he was distracted by nine sea monsters and had slay them. His claim childishly rejected by Unferth when he implies that even though Beowulf did slay the sea monsters


A good example of leadership in Beowulf is king Hrothgar, when he warned young Beowulf before his departure back home. As time progressed Beowulf became a king, and he is presented with a problem. A dragon has been harassing villagers, and has been causing severe damage. As expected Beowulf doesn't think twice and accepts the challenge, without even considering his old age. Had he listened to Hrothgars advice, he would have had a better chance completing the task with out risking fatal injuries.  In his fight with the dragon his arrogance clouded his judgment, by asking the soldiers he brought with him to stay behind. The soldiers obeyed Beowulf except for Wiglaf, because he needed more people in the cave. Granted there was only one iron shield, Beowulf is a brave man and a courageous warrior



On the other side of spectrum there is Sir Gawain, I couldn't help but to think about Eric Idle’s character Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He fails every test thrown at him, from the advances of Bertilak’s wife to not disclosing the magic belt to the Green Knight. Gawain even flinched while the Green Knight was delivering his well deserved blow, going against the beheading for a beheading agreement. The Green Knight on the other hand has proven himself as an honorable knight, by abiding the knights code of conduct and by not going back on his word. Gawain fell for Morgan Le Faye’s elaborate plan to test his chivalry and nobility, and has failed time and time again. Gawain’s leadership is non existent, to fight under Gawain’s rule is suicide. The right balance of being courageous and being conservative is hard to achieve


What can be said about leadership in Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, one is too fragile and the other is too agressive. They are better at following orders than giving them, and there is nothing wrong with following orders.

My current assignment for next week's lab is to devise an experimental procedure that demonstrates the relationship between a volume of gas and its temperature when the pressure and molecules of air stay constant.  

So far I've been great at following the instructions in experimental procedures.  But I'm drawing a complete blank on how to do this
Oh and I've got a Lab partner who is on the school's baseball team?  He's not very bright, and have been working alone this entire time and turning in lab reports with both our names on it.  I'd be pissed at him, but there wouldn't be any point... if I give him responsibility he'll just lower my grade.  Plus he makes himself useful during the actual execution of the experiments... does what I tell him, and never messes up recording the right data.  I also know he's grasping the material.  I give him the report before we turn it in, and tell him to look it over and ask me any questions if there's something he doesn't understand.  He get's mostly B's on his homework, and scraped by with an A- on the first test, so I know I'm not just hanging him out to dry.

Trouble is, and for all I know, the pressure isn't remaining constant.  At least I know the molecules of air trapped under the graduating cyllinder  remain constant.

Am I on the right track on this?  I'm not trying to cheat

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions.  Talked to one of the lab assistants today about it.  He said to just dip a balloon under water of varying degrees of temperature.  While it's under the water I just do my best to wrap a string around it to record the balloon's circumference.  He said the graduated cyllinder idea would work, and was extremely difficult to keep from swaying one way or the other.

Anyway, wrap a string around it's at the right point, and keep your finger on the right place.  After that the string provided in class stretches considerably when wet.  Apparently the whole point of the experiment is just to see if we can come up with anything, and we simply will be judged on whether or not we try something that ""makes theoretical"" sense.  Doesn't matter how hard it is to execute.  Lollllll  Thanks for the help!

Here's my problem.

---

&gt;Find the discriminant of *f*(*x*) = 2*x*^(2) + 2*bx* + c.
&gt;
&gt;Hence show that *f*(*x*) can be expressed as a sum
&gt;
&gt;(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2) 
&gt;
&gt;of two distinct squares (that is

---

Okay

Δ = (2*b*)^(2) − 4 × 2 × *c*

= 4*b*^(2) − 8*c*

= 4(*b*^(2) − 2*c*)

But I don't understand how it can help me for the second part of the question. Surely to show the result in the second part of the question

(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2)

and then show that it cannot satisfy the indefinite case (Δ ≥ 0) but can satisfy the definite case (Δ &lt; 0)

I've done that as follows:

(*x* − *r*)^(2) + (*x* − *s*)^(2)

= *x*^(2) − 2*rx* + *r*^(2) + *x*^(2) − 2*sx* + *s*^(2)

= 2*x*^(2) − 2(*r* + *s*)*x* + (*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

so Δ = (−2(*r* + *s*))^(2) − 4 × 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

= 4(*r* + *s*)^(2) − 4 × 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))

= 4[(*r* + *s*)^(2) − 2(*r*^(2) + *s*^(2))]

= 4(*r*^(2) + 2*rs* + *s*^(2) − 2*r*^(2) − 2*s*^(2))

= −4(*r*^(2) − 2*rs* + *s*^(2))

= −4(*r* − *s*)^(2)

and −4(*r* − *s*)^(2) cannot be greater than or equal to zero

Therefore −4(*r* − *s*)^(2) &lt; 0. This is the definite case, *a* &gt; 0, so it must also be positive definite.

---

That's how I would answer this question. But the question clearly wants me to do something with the discriminant of 

*f*(*x*) = 2*x*^(2) + 2*bx* + c

and for the life of me I have no idea what that is

1367162669.0,1d9wse,Grammar Nazi's unite and correct my English paper,firevint,10,6,9,"    The genre of fantasy is one which in generally seen by the public as a form of escapism which has good entertainment value.  This understanding of fantasy is completely valid yet there is also another way to interpret this genre; by looking at fantasy as a form that raises serious issues concerning the implications of humanity and her institutions.  Such an outlook is not unique yet it is not common

               By looking at fantasy novels from different periods of recent history the events that burdened society as a whole become evident; one such topic is the decline of religion and the implications that it has with daily life.  This relation between religion and society is established clearly within the writings of popular twentieth century authors.

               The author C.S Lewis is known to be a well received author, which is a response to how people were moving away from the faith, and it shows how the author was deeply concerned with this and attempts to show his audience that they need to turn back to their faiths in order to attain salvation.  C.S. Lewis was a very spiritual man who attempted to highlight how it is in the best interest of the individual to turn to religion in order to resist the influences of the devil and his associates. (Kilby 39)  This idea of turning to God and heaven for salvation is seen several times in The Screwtape Letters indicating that the author was deeply concerned for how people were not concerning themselves deeply enough with their faith.  This is seen through the actions of Screwtape who “confesses that he is tempted to give up hell for heaven” (Kilby 40.) This confession of Screwtape’s desires reveals that even those who are of great evil has a desire to perform good actions and turn towards God and away from the devil.  This is one response to the changes between the interaction of humanity and the Christian Church, this same concept of religion is again addressed from another perspective by R.A. Salvatore in his Forgotten Realms series.

               The stories written by R.A. Salvatore, the Underdark and the Surface World.  The protagonist of The Forgotten Realms series is a Dark elf of the Underdark who flees to the surface in order to escape a society that he feels he can not belong to in good conscientiousness. The Drow or Dark Elves favor the Spider Queen, Lolth their deity, whose favor is paramount and if a group ever loses her favor the destruction the family can and does ensue. This is seen several times within the first novels serving as a warning to humanity to be suspicious of radicalism.  The first time that the reader may observe the brutality that is associated with radicalism is within the first novel of the series when the protagonist’s family destroys a household that has offended their deity.  These forms of sheer butchering of others of the same race show how radicalism enforces these forms of brutish punishment for religious treason.  The second time that this radicalism is truly seen again is in the destruction of the protagonists family, the few survivors are taken into households taken as their own. (Ch. 25, Exile*********)  This calls attention to the growing radical actions of certain religious sects which were, during the time that these novels were being produced

               The Drow society shares one key common component with human culture and that is the role of religion within society.  Within the Drow society the religion surrounding the Spider Queen is all that is important as her will dictates order in the seemingly lawless society, it has been interpreted that the principal deity of Christianity is a male as it is addressed as Father, and how until recently there has been a great gender based inequality within parts of the world with this religious background.  This goes to further show how fantasy reflects the values of the society to which the author belongs and as such points out the flaws of that very same society.

               The difference between political and religious rules blurs even further in The Chronicles of Narnia.  This series of novels by C.S. Lewis establish Aslan, a creator,   seen in the novel The Magicians Nephew, when Aslan creates Narnia from nothing and keeps away evil through use of a magical tree (Kilby 118), which is clearly a retelling of the book of Genesis with use of ethereal representations of God.  In the later novels C.S. Lewis shows that Aslan is not merely a creator of the world of Narnia but is also a leader to its inhabitants, seen in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in which the unity of the “good” creatures of Narnia unite behind Aslan in order to combat the white witch.  This merely demonstrates that religion is the base of society and that once upon a time its religious and political leaders were one in the same.

These political views are responses to movements that went against the teachings of the majority religion of the western culture.  During the time of these authors gay marriage became an issue as it became somewhat accepted within the western world as it was no longer considered a crime to be part of a same sex marriage although it remained to be seen as a grave sin in the Christian faith. This impacted the authors enough for them to write in a manner which highlights the opposition that can be expected from a society that is deeply rooted in faith based culture when presented with an idea that is counter intuitive to the majority religion.

               Religious issues were not the only thing to fear during the time period in which these authors wrote.  For there was a great fear that is associated with other regions of the political spectrum; throughout this time there was the rise in popularity throughout the east with Red or Communist forms of government.  The idea that there was a threat to the current way of life is seen in the most popular fantasy series of our time

               The conflict within the Lord of the Rings is quite obvious that there is an uprising of seemingly dark enemies from the south and the east rising up against the great kingdoms of the west.  This should sound very familiar to the events of the Second World War because the parallel is too blatant to not be noticed by an observant reader.  By understanding the correlation between the west being united against the east the reader can establish how it is really allegorical to Democracy being against dictatorships and other forms of Red government; Jane Chance wrote that that destroying the ring meant the “refusal of power as domination by the One”. (61) This statement reads as a standing position against being ruled by a single individual, the proletariat works for the collective instead of the individual, it creates the sub-consciences link between evil and these tenets of communism.  The symbol of the ring further shows how power will corrupt even the most pure hearted of individuals if they are tasked with it. This is seen in the final book of the trilogy, during this book Frodo falls to corruption and falls drops incapacitated and Sam forces the completion of the task by taking Frodo up to the entrance to the fiery volcano. (34-35) this final act is a lesson in what to do when humanity falls behind a corrupt individual, the onus of responsibility falls from the leader to their subordinates meaning it is on humanity to ensure that their leaders do what they are there to do.

               The fear of the communist society and fascist governments is also seen in one of the most popular adolescent teen fantasy novels of our time.  The Harry Potter series has legions of fans of all ages throughout the literate regions of the world, such a comparison can be made between the Weasley family and the Malfoy family.  Both are pure-blood wizarding families but since the Weasleys are not as wealthy and have more children they are seen as lower in the socio-political hierarchy.  The Malfoys side with Voldemort for there is promise of power and continued succession of the pure blood families’ linage. (Laiacono 176).  These ideas that Harry Potter has allegorical sections comparing it to the Nazi party are even shared by the author herself, in an interview between Lizo Mzimba from BBC and J.K. Rowling, Rowling stated after Lizo pointed out Voldemorts impure blood line “Like Hitler!” (CITATION NEEDED) then continuing to state how she feels both Hitler and Voldemort acted similarly by projecting their own problems onto others and exploiting them by turning the public against them.

               Through these representations of corruption within political institutions fantasy authors serve a warning against forms of totalitarian governments and how easily they can be manipulated and corrupted by power; for the writings of both Tolkien and J.K. Rowling were written in an era when totalitarian forms of government were on the rise and were being perceived as a threat to western society.

               All these representations of society have lead to the creation of typical archetypes of characters which are now commonly seen throughout the majority of popular fantasy.  In order to counteract the force that draws humanity from its religious roots divine characters have become prominent and their influence is great, through Frodo and Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series and many more in other fantastical novels.  All these characters lead to one thing an increasing pressure upon the reader to turn back to the Christian faith by subliminally making religious links.  The second archetype of character that is found in all popular fantasy is the manifestation of and evil force that stems from a form of corruption which is a threat to the rest of the inhabitants of the fantastical world.  This manifestation of corruption is often seen in one character or one group of characters within fantasy novels.  This character is not always a living being but it is always something sentient and has a great effect on all inhabitants of the fantastical world, for instance The One Ring in Lord of the rings and the Crystal Shard in the Forgotten Realms series.  These types of characters both came into existence as a form to call the reader’s attention to real world threats to the western way of life and depicts how one must act in order to maintain the kind of society that they currently enjoy.",,False,self,t5_2r6f3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/1d9wse/grammar_nazis_unite_and_correct_my_english_paper/

First of all

Here is my poem:

[It looks funny on here so I took a screenshot as well](http://imgur.com/M7KVxvU)

I sat at the base of the mountain
Staring up at the top.
It seemed like climbing it would be an impossible task
It seemed surreal.

I sat for days
Afraid of what I’d gotten myself in to.
The thought of the climb gnawing
Eating at my insides.

Eventually there was nothing left inside to eat
So I began my climb.

The progress was slow and numbing
Like counting the grains of sand at the bottom of a lake.
Constantly having to stop to re-evaluate
And try to grasp at some sort of motivation to continue.

The climb was difficult
After each step quitting seemed more and more inviting.
I was almost certain that in the end the work would not have been in vain
And I would feel accomplished.

It was when I was near the top that it seemed to become easier
Each step taking me closer and closer to the end.

Once I took that final step onto the top of the mountain
I looked around and was confused.
I expected to feel closure but there was nothing.
I sat and felt nothing.
It seemed like it wasn’t worth it.

Even after completing the seemingly impossible
I was still empty.
I should’ve felt full and proud
Instead



I'm not 100% about the rules of poetry

	Ivan IV Vasilyevich, which was one of the longest out of any Russian Tsar, he helped start the beginning of a Russian Empire and killed many people along the way.  Throughout his life, Ivan had a very tough childhood, a good period of his life, and a very bad period of his life.  
	Ivan the Terrible was born on August 25, Vasili III, died from blood poisoning when Ivan was only 3 years old.  Ivan was then pronounced the Grand Prince of Moscow, as stated in his fathers will.  Ivan had one younger brother, named Yuri, who was thought less of and was treated very poorly.  When Ivan was 8, his mother died of unknown causes, he declared himself Tsar of Russia
	In the early years of Ivan the Terrible’s reign, including Sir Hugh Willoughby, opened up the White Sea for trading routes between Russia and England without any customs fees.  This lasted over 150 years, and it was one of his great accomplishments.  On June 16, 1552, Ivan led a 150,000 army towards Kazan.  The Russians used over 150 cannons and had many battering rams to break through the city.  On October 2, and Ivan the Terrible freed nearly 100, they were unsuccessful
	When Ivan’s wife died in 1560, Ivan was suspicious that a wealthy city called Novgorod was plotting to kill him, so he burned down Novgorod and all of the cities surrounding them.  In 1581, his daughter in law was pregnant with her first child.  Ivan saw her and thought that she was wearing immodest clothing, so he beat her, which then caused her to have a miscarriage.  When Ivan’s oldest son found out about this, they started arguing.  This ended with Ivan striking his son in the head with his staff
	Ivan the Terrible died from a stroke on March 28, who died childless in 1598.  Overall, calling Ivan terrible isn’t really the whole story.  Although he did have a very violent life and killed many people towards the end of his reign, he also helped Russia out in very many ways, and I hope people don’t remember him for just being terrible.

The tiny animals that feed on them live much  longer and tend to *accumulate biomass over time.* The single-celled algae produce much more living material but are eaten as fast as they are produced and, so, do not accumulate a large biomass.**

http://www.imgur.com/Y7rRT.jpeg The above diagram shows a winding drum with a rope and mass attached. If the mass is released


A) given the above dimensions


B) write an equation depicting d'alemberts principle for the system. Answer is mg=ma+I(alpha) 


C) use the equation to calculate angular acceleration (alpha).
if a=r*alpha
mg=m(r*alpha)+I(alpha)
therefore alpha=(mg)/(I+mr)
total mass of the pulley is 3.834kg
alpha=(3.834*9.81)/(4.3255x10^-6 +3.834*0.045)=212.668rad/s^2


D) Calculate the linear velocity of the mass after it has dropped 3m
a=r*alpha
a=212.668*0.045 = 9.57m/s^2
v^2 = u^2 +2as
v=root(0^2 +2*9.57*3) = 7.578m/s


E) show that energy is conserved during the motion of the mass dropping 3m

mgz= (mv^2 )/2 + (I(omega)^2 )/2
mgz=3.834*9.81*3 = 112.835J
(mv^2 )/2 = 110.085J
Omega = v/r = 7.578/0.045 = 168.4 rad/s
(I(omega)^2 )/2= 61.33J
61.33+110.085 is not equal to 112.835J so I have gone wrong somewhere but can't see where.

I inquired more about the assignment because the instructions them self were not clear to me. Basically from what I've gathered the assignment is to compare  the aspects of the tales and characters in the Canterbury Tales to what was happening during the time period in Great Britain.

Here is what is holding me up! I have no idea what events relate well in regaurds to Great Britain's history and the tales themselves. The only things i have been able to think of are


* Boubonic Plague/ Black Death
* Relationships between the corruption in the church

I can't think of enough examples to write 5 pages however on the characters of the C.B. I understand how the nun is corrupt

My request as far as help goes is that i need someone to help me come up with materials
If you would like to write the paper for me though

La economía de las Islas Canarias está basada en el turismo y agricultura tropical. Los turistas son españoles, suecos, rusos, franceses, suizos, holandeses y otras nacionalidades europeas.  Las islas producen tabaco, frutas y verduras. Científicos se preocupan que las islas están explotadas con producción demasiada.

Edit: I'm also having trouble with another question:

&gt;
&gt;So, but we will next week.)

So
*n = 100

*Mv = 75

*sigma = 4

*Mnv = 70

*std error = sigma/sqr rt of n = 493

*H0= The average household income of voters equals that of non-voters
*Ha = The average household income of voters is greater than that of non-voters. 

The significance level is 0.05

To find the z score we follow the formula (Mv - Mnv)^2 /(std. error) = (5000)^2 /493 = 10.14. When compared to the z table

Did I do that right? 

Thanks again.

&gt;Bob 3
&gt;John 8
&gt;Jill 10
&gt;Jack 0
&gt;Barb 8
&gt;Kelly 7
&gt;Joe 7
&gt;Melissa 8

&gt;a) What is the standard error of this sample?

&gt;b) Create a 95% confidence interval of the mean score on this liberal-
conservative scale for the population of students from which this sample was drawn.

&gt;c) On this scale 5 is a true moderate, not moderate. Construct a hypothesis test for this claim. You have to give me the alternative hypothesis and your conclusion as to whether you would reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis as well as your reasoning for this conclusion (hint: remember that you want to check and see if the confidence interval includes the value hypothesized under the null hypothesis).

* For a) we find that the value of Mew is 5.8 by adding all the values and dividing by n = 10. 
* Then to find the variance we subtract 5.8 from each entry, we sqr rt 9.96 to get the sigma of 3.156 which rounds to 3.2. 
* To get the SE

* For b) we use the formular 5.8 plus/minus (1.96 * 1.01) which equals 3.82 and 7.78 which are the values within 2 std. deviations form Mew to show the 95% Confidence Intervals. 


* For c) H0 = the average student is moderate
Ha = the average student is not moderate
* Since the 95% CI showed the range is from 3.82 through 7.78

And the second regarding the consumption function is 

The consumption function is 

C= [7(2sqrt(I^3)+5]/(I+11)

Marginal Propensity to consume = dC/dI

The marginal propensity to consume is defined as the rate of change of consumption with respect to income:


The other half of the question is:

The total national savings is defined as the difference between income I and consumption C:

S=I - C

The marginal propensity to save is defined as the rate of change of savings with respect to income:

Marginal Propensity to Save = dS/dI = 1 - dC/dI

I think it would repel as the ring structure allows it to have the effects that a coil usually have (push a magnet into a solenoid). As there is a change in magnetic flux linkage, after the switch is turned on for awhile, the magnetic field would stabilize and stop increasing. Hence, the ring would fall back and when this happens, again there is a change in magnetic flux linkage causing the ring to get repelled again. This results in a jerking motion where the ring is moved back and forth.

**Script**

The brothers, so it was important for him to be as impressive as possible when performing the ceremony. Scott gave the spear to Cameron the day before the ceremony and Cameron hid the spear for safe keeping under a bag of yams in a hand-cart  parked in the middle of the village. Cameron reasoned that the spear would be safe in the hand-cart  because it would be hidden from sight and no potential thief would look for a spear in a hand-cart  under bags of yams because yam farmers do not hunt. When Cameron woke on the morning of the ceremony he went strait away to the hand-cart  to retrieve the spear but when he got there the hand-cart  was gone and with it the spear. Cameron followed the tracks of the hand-cart  and found that they led to the main road and disappeared amongst all the other tracks there. Cameron went to Scott and told him that someone had stolen the spear. Scott demanded that Cameron repay him for the loss of the spear but Cameron insists that it is not his fault because the thief of the spear would have stolen it regardless of who was last in possession of the spear. 
Blessing

**Argument**

“I, so I felt sorry for him and let him borrow mine. I would never loan my spear if it was to be used for a task where it could become lost or damaged, like hunting, but for the ceremony I did not expect anything to happen to it. I made Cameron promise to me that he would return my spear as soon as the ceremony was over and he would also bring me some meat in appreciation of the favor. The next morning Cameron came to me and told me that he had lost my spear. When I told him to find my spear and return it he refused and said it's not his fault. He has also not given me any meat!  Cameron owes me a new spear and lots of meat for the trouble he has put me through!”

**Response**

“I, not just to him and I had as much right to use it in the ceremony as he does to use my plow. I hid the spear in a very clever hiding spot under a giant sack of yams in a hand-cart , but when I went to retrieve the spear I found that someone had stolen it and the hand-cart . I searched for the thief but she is nowhere to be found and my families spear is likely gone for good. When I told my brother about our families unfortunate loss he became unreasonable and blamed me for the thief’s actions. I have tried to explain to him that the thief would have stolen the spear no matter who had it last and that he and I are both victims, but he refuses to stop casting blame on me.” ",,False,self,False,t3_xqx1j

People all around the world, at least once in there life have claimed a form of redemption. The feeling, the thought, and most importantly the need of redemption are an integral part of human culture.

History has shown that many of the great civilizations have strived to liberate themselves from the errors of their own past. The utilization and context word redemption has been stretched in many different ways. Some people use this term to justify there actions; some people use this to protect their dignity; some use it amend their actions that have affected them or others involved. At the end of all the contemplation, Hosseni manages to elegantly illustrate the theme of redemption through life, and the initiative to correct his actions.

To determine the population who suffers stroke (and that is going to the model) we have the incidence (i.e 1.32 per 1000 people) and prevalence (i.e. 1.72 per 1000 people) rates. In this model I also have to consider the people that suffers Atrial fibrillation (which is a cardiac arrhythmia problem that might lead to stroke) for this we have also an Incidence /prevalence rate. The PROBLEM here is that in the pool of people with suffering from Stroke are also people that have Atrial Fibrillation

Could this be solved with a simple Bayes's Theorem? or what do you recommend.

Astrid’s Viewpoint on Ron Is Twisted Because of Claire


In White Oleander by Janet Fitch, Astrid’s narrow-minded personality caused her to worship Claire and repress any true emotions she had if it conflicts with Claire’s viewpoints. 


Astrid loved Claire because Claire treated her better than Astrid’s previous foster mothers. Because Astrid was accustomed to arrogant mothers that forced her into a tough lifestyle (Ingrid), and blamed it on Ron and her, rather than realize it was Claire’s fault only. 


Astrid blindly followed Claire’s thoughts and opinions without ever questioning Claire. For example, seeing if she wanted support, and did not defend Ron. Astrid’s evident support for Claire in that situation was gratuitous, and it ended in her ultimately disliking Ron simply because it seemed he was troubling Claire. After Claire committed suicide, Astrid irrationally destroyed everything in her room and acted like her life was over, as well. Astrid went into denial, questioning reality and disbelieving the possibility that Claire could ever be gone. It is clear that Astrid thinks Claire is the only reason she should be happy and everything that Claire does is rational and right.


Astrid’s true emotions for Ron are hidden by her biased love for Claire. Astrid actually empathized with Ron, and it is apparent that Astrid feels bad for him; however, before that, she says that Ron “didn’t know Claire” (260). Astrid’s biased love for Claire and pity for Ron clash as Astrid sometimes will blame Ron for having too much power (as evident in the statement, “it’s a man’s world”), but then feel bad for him and hate Claire’s weakness and paranoia.


 It can be said that Astrid does not hate Ron. She empathizes with him; however, Astrid would have bonded with Ron and her feeling with Ron would have been parallel to her affection with Claire; however, since Astrid only felt the generosity and honesty of Claire, she loved Claire more than Ron. This unreasonable amount of love for Claire overshadowed her empathy for Ron, and so, Astrid’s viewpoint on Ron was twisted because of Claire.

What I'm looking for is help just understanding the basics of what each question is asking.

1. Asserted on p. 7 is that

2. Roger Bacon understood science as description of experience. Since no two things are exactly alike
	because the constitution of a man's body is in continual mutation, in the desire of almost any one and the same object.
How do concepts allow avoiding this conclusion

3. In class it was asserted identity by commonality is a necessary condition of deductive reasoning, Robert Audi concludes,
	If we consider science in historical perspective and do not realize it
Explain why Audi concludes

4. Expressed in class was that concepts exist to simplify reality. Explain why this is necessary and how concepts achieve this objective. What is often sarcastically referred to as ""political correctness"" can be understood as a product of inclusive disjunction. Make clear why political correctness can be understood in this way
5. Appealing to lecture, looking at pp. 7-8. Incorporate in this discussion why there can be no analysis of an object, only a concept. Consider in this respect Earle's p. 89 categorization. ""Metaphysic Designates activities under two main headings. 
	a. the analysis of basic categories
	b. the inventory of basic kinds of things.
and his somewhat hasty p. 90 judgment ""there is really not very much to say about being qua being.

6. According to Earle on p. 28, can be fully verbalized."" Why cannot know-how be fully verbalized employing the concept of analysis in terms of criteria? What does this tell us about the nature of propositional knowledge? Identify what additional property of propositions distinguish them from declarative sentences. Finally, what is meant by the assertion on p. 24 that, ""statements and propositions are not the same thing?""

7. On pp. 26-27 Earle asserts that ""we should distinguish belief as a propositional attitude - that is

8. Claimed on p. 19 is that ""Philosophy is the only academic subject that focuses on conceptual clarity."" Accepting this
	Metaphysics, since it involves the most basic and pervasive contrast in 		human thinking.: the contrast between appearance and reality.
In answering this question
	Now what relevance does ""the contrast between appearance and reality"" have for philosophy, ""putting aside"" the question of the existence of ""reality,"" leaving us with ""appearance."" It is this move which leads to phenomenology. What significance, if any, does Husserl's approach have for philosophy as ""the only academic subject that focuses on conceptual clarity?""


My answer to #1 is example: 
1.

	A necessary condition is a common property of members of a set
	A sufficient condition is a similar property of members of a set.
	There are three conditions to have a successful analysis. Each analysis will have analsandums, which is what is doing the analysis. 
	1. The analysandum and it's analysan must mean the same thing.
	2. The analysandum and analysans must be alike in truth-vale.
	3. The analysans must be more clear than the anysandum. 

	1. X is a senior
	2. X needs to fulfill general education requirements.
	3. X has completed all classes required to complete a mechanical engineering degree
	4. X has a GPA of 2.0 or greater.

	These conditions come as a package to determine if a student is able to graduate. To graduate, has to meet all the necessary conditions. Condition 1, 2, and 4 are necessary conditions to graduate. Condition 3 is a sufficient condition. If a student is able to graduate, you know he is a senior, has fulfilled general education requirements, and also has a GPA of 2.0 or greater because of the necessary conditions. You wouldn't know if he has completed a mechanical engineering degree, you will know he is a senior

1310406643.0,iml43,Molecular Cloning,morris1202,6,0,2,"Given 5 plates

1- Cells only

2- Cells only

3 - Cells + vector + insert

4 - Cells + vector

5 - Cells + vector + insert + ligase

From my understanding


This is where confusion starts:
Therefore

Can the absence of ligase still result in a loose binding of the vector and insert to produce about 100 colonies opposed to a lawn? Or will the absence of ligase result in the production of no colonies?

And without the insert

So in plates 1 and 2 there should be no colonies. Plate 3 will have about 100 colonies

1309620691.0,if0zl,Weight lifting equivalent to boiling a cup of tea?,redditnoveltyaccoun2,8,3,4,"To boil the the water to make one cup of tea you need some number of joules.. 

I was wondering if it was equivalent to (in work) to lifting up a weight (that I could actually lift) some height (that I could actually lift it).

I looked up how much joules it takes to boil a cup of tea and that's 125000 J. So according to work = force \* distance = mass \* gravity \* distance it's something like lifting a 111 kg weight up 111 meters? :/ that's ridiculous so what does it really take?",self,t5_2r6f3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/if0zl/weight_lifting_equivalent_to_boiling_a_cup_of_tea/
1309306131.0,ibt16,Political science article analysis,Zenai,5,1,1,"Hey people I've written what I guess is an article analysis. The assignment is to find an article (I've chosen [this](http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-05-06-creationism-teacher_N.htm)) and answer three questions about it. The three questions I have to answer for the analysis are these

*  What civil liberties issue is raised in the article?

*  What constitutional passages are relevant to the discussion? List the relevant words in the relevant amendment(s) related to your article.

*  Summarize what both sides of this legal argument are contending. If a judge has made a ruling

I have a 92 average in this class the final is next week and I'm not a strong writer as you can probably tell so I'm trying to do my due diligence to not bomb into a B average with this grade.

I've put my notes in the paper in brackets [] if anyone has any idea where that precedent was set I would love to know
