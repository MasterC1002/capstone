Let me know your thoughts and suggestions.

**Interested in an MA?**

1. Constructing a List

These are the only two unfunded MA programs for which it might not be insane to consider attending. Of particular note is Tufts
&gt;* Brandeis University
&gt;* Tufts University
    
These are generally considered the top tier funded MA programs out there.
&gt;* Georgia State University
&gt;* Northern Illinois University
&gt;* University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee

These are the next tier programs
&gt;* Texas Tech
&gt;* Texas A&amp;M
&gt;* University of Houston
&gt;* Virginia Tech
&gt;* Western Michigan

These are some Canadian MA programs
&gt;* Simon Fraser University 
&gt;* Victoria
&gt;* University of Alberta
&gt;* Queen's
&gt;* Calgary
&gt;* Toronto
&gt;* Dalhousie
&gt;* University of British Columbia  

If you're interested in looking at more funded MA programs, it should be an indication that the university regularly offers stipends to incoming graduate students.

1. Important Considerations

An MA's placement record and funding level are the two most important factors in choosing where to apply and where to attend an MA. Generally speaking, you may have to share a place with two or three other students if saving money is of the utmost importance to you.

1. Why should I be interested in an MA?

You might be interested in an MA if
&gt;* you were not a philosophy major (though this does not preclude you from being admitted to a PhD program)
&gt;* you need or want supplementary philosophical education before the PhD
&gt;* you want to be more competitive/attractive to PhD programs (Remarks have been made that an increasing amount of PhD students are coming in with MA's)
&gt;* you simply want to keep your options open depending on your PhD admission results. I hesitate to say MA's are a safety

**Interested in a PhD?**

There's going to be a lot less information here. 

1. Constructing a List

I hope you have some philosophical areas that you want to specialize in. Though keep in mind a department with strong

Use these [&gt;GENERAL&lt;](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp) rankings and [&gt;SPECIALTY&lt;](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown.asp) rankings of philosophy programs to guide you in looking at programs. Start from the top and work your way down. Look at the department: their past course offerings, and their placement record. See if the program looks attractive to you. If it does, mark it down.

1. Important Considerations

Placement and fit (and placement again). 

**Interested in applying?**

1. Aspects of Your Application

I will address things in reverse order of importance

1. Transcript &amp; GRE

By this point

For your GRE, it's not worth stressing about. Just study and get a reasonable score and don't worry about it.

1. Statement of Purpose

The importance of your SOP is almost as enigmatic as your GRE scores. But the general consensus is that fit is pretty important in how a university decides who it's going to admit

This is not a chance for you to write your autobiography about how you got or why you are interested in philosophy. 

This is a chance for you to
&gt;* state your philosophical interests in broad strokes
&gt;* state your philosophical interests in specific, and then
&gt;* state how your interests align with those of the department. Give names

Here are three examples of successful statements of purpose: [&gt;ONE&lt;](http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/sample-statement-of-purpose.html)

1. Letters of Recommendation

It took me longer than it should have to connect the dots on this one. Prestige matters a lot. The first day you step foot on your university's campus, and instead made a great connection and did great work with another professor who you know will be able to write you a very personal and strong letter.

Here's a [&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/09/applying-to-philosophy-phd-programs_20.html) and here's a [&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/advice-on-perso.html) about letters.

**Interested in enabling your post-application anxiety?**

There are two different forums you can visit. [&gt;HERE&lt;](http://forum.thegradcafe.com/forum/40-philosophy/) and [&gt;HERE&lt;](http://who-got-in.livejournal.com/). The former leans continental, and there can be useful tidbits of knowledge on these forums about the application process among other things.

First, makes life worth living? When people are normally asked this, answers are usually things like ""travel,"" ""a fine wine,"" ""the love of a good woman,"" or something else that is generally regarded as a positive thing in life. But these things are contingent, not essential, but not others. What makes life, stripped of all other contingent properties -- experiencing and interpreting sensory phenomena, worth it? Previous answers to this question I have received have lacked philosophical rigor and can easily be dismantled (namely because people persist in listing contingent things when I'm talking about the essential)

The other dilemma that has been eating up my mind lately has been people's tendency to use and retreat into self-justifying narratives as a way to avoid harsh truths they'd rather not face. We see this all around us. People who don't bathe, stuck-up bitches. People who receive a thorough and accurate dressing down of their talent are soothed by their peers, who tell them things like ""what do they know? You're great!"" A crushing bore who interprets his partner's yawns not as an indication that it's time to shift topics or develop more diverse interests but as a sign that their partner is not smart enough to keep up in conversation with them. I'm distressed by being unable to tell when something that makes one feel better about one's self is something that is true, or is just another self-justifying narrative that hides from us real problems about ourselves.

Why is this idea widespread?  The implicature seems to be that *positive* claims can be proven, to say that his negative claims are somehow categorically epistemically weaker than his positive claims.  Aren't all such judgments made as best as possible on the basis of the available evidence?

So I've been trying to figure out what's the deal.  One possibility is that people who say ""You can never prove a negative"" are just acknowledging the possibility of actual but undiscovered evidence against the negative claim.  But this seems wrongheaded, there exists actual but undiscovered falsifying evidence.  

So how about this: finding no evidence that *P* (say, as we always do, the principle looks wrong.  For example, someone deals me a card from a properly shuffled deck.  I have no evidence that it's the ace of spades, but given what I know about decks of cards I'm warranted in believing that it's not the ace of spades.

Or, I can probably help myself to the auxiliary premise: *if there were evidence for JK being a bootlegger, I'd almost certainly have discovered it*.  Once I add this premise to my set, it follows from my lack of evidence for the claim to having good reason to believe its negation.

I recently took an existentialism class and it has heavily challenged my previous world view. To give you all a little context, and *The Unconditional Imperative*;  Marcel's *Ontological Mystery*; Camus's *An Absurd Reasoning*; Merleau-Ponty's *Cogito*; Beauvoir's *Ambiguity and Freedom*; and finally Sartre's *A New Authentic Way of Being Oneself*.

I feel like throughout the class I was able to understand the majority of concepts presented in the texts, find a corporate Software Engineering job, and make a decent amount of money. I had somehow convinced myself that by achieving these life goals I would be happy.

Now that I've taken this class I've realized how ridiculous that sounds. My motivation to try was to achieve some sort of monetary and societal status, teach in a third world country, fight for social change, do something that ""means"" something. But why does that ""mean"" something anymore than any other action someone takes? The end goal of that is to help support human life and improve the quality of living for others. But why? What says that anyone elses' existence will be any better or worse if I do something like that? 

I feel so overwhelmed by this realization that I've never really attached any meaning to my life or actions, so it seems like self-deception. Every day now I feel like giving up, like life is so pointless and overwhelming and vast that I just can't deal with it. I want to disappear, I want to stop thinking. I want to feel like I matter, but I don't. I keep feeling like I just want to die so I can stop feeling all these emotions, so I can stop feeling sadness, and hopelessness.

Well

At its best, bridge the gap between seemingly disparate topics, and illuminate foundations so basic that we may not have even recognized beforehand how much we had staked on them.

In short, then you're in the right place.

So how does this work?
---

You ask questions; we provide answers. Not definitive answers,000 years of philosophical inquiry. We're not here to proclaim our authority. We want to give you the benefit of our background, so you can decide what answers make the most sense to you.

The ""we"" in this particular case is our panel. Taking our inspiration from the AskScience model, [see here](http://redd.it./mext6/).

Non-panelists are also welcome to join in on the discussion

What kind of questions should I ask?
---

That's up to you. Yes

Though it may not always seem so to the layperson, ""How can we know enough about the world to live well?"" Don't be afraid that your question is too simple or not philosophical enough. Even a seemingly flimsy question like ""[What is love?](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plato/p71sy/)"" can change the course of history if approached with enough philosophical seriousness.

Most of all

What kind of answers can I expect?
---

Our goal is to provide answers that are informed by a study of the history of philosophy, you're encouraged to follow the citations included there and learn more yourself.

Can I ask about school assignments?
---

Sure; we don't mind helping philosophy students understand what they're studying. Just bear in mind that we're not here to do your work *for you*. We'll be glad to help out with sources, and don't get upset if our responses look more like guidance than a cheat sheet. We're less interested in your grade than we are in making sure that you understand the subject matter.

My big suggestion is that we build a revolving panel based on the [AskScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwibi/askscience_panel_of_scientists_iv/) model. Non-panelists would still be able to give answers to questions asked here, rather than with the panelists own opinions about a given topic. For example, if someone were to ask about the ethics of an omnivorous diet, panelists should generally seek to give a fair representation of what a professional or established philosophy (like Peter Singer) has to say on the matter, *before* the panelists gives their own opinion. If they can back that summary with a title that the questioner can seek out for more, so much the better. In fact, consistently failing to provide a citation should probably be one of the grounds for removing a user from the panel. A lot of the questions likely to crop up in a reddit like this will be more general than you would get in an academic setting

The point is this: part of the mission of AskPhilosophy should be to demonstrate to questioners the relevance of philosophy to the problems they face, we risk running everyone off, when we could be drawing them into more complex and rigorous philosophical thought.

AskScience is pretty strict about removing off-topic comments. Should we be that strict? Generally speaking, it may make sense to moderate comments more strictly.

I don't think we should necessarily discourage people from asking for help with their assignments

1351536799.0,12afsp,Questions about Stoicism. [Warning: Much reading.],JayWalken,23,1,15,"Hey

Epictetus has said the following:

* ""Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men's desires

* ""Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where is neither of them? In those things that are independent of the will.""

* ""Man is disturbed not by things

However

Epictetus seems to think that the above can be achieved either by repeating the bullet-pointed quotes as maxims when appropriate or

* ""I desire X

* ""X is independent of the will

* ""My opinion about X is disturbing me, I must cease to be of this opinion.""

However, seems to me to think that a psychological revolution is to occur as a result of repeating maxims. I am very willing to admit that what seems to me is mistaken.

Then I heard the story of [Zeno of Citium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) and it provided a possible alternative. From Wikipedia:

""Zeno was a merchant and that after surviving a shipwreck, the most famous [Cynic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy\)) living at that time in Greece... In one incident during his tutelage with Crates, he was made to carry a pot of lentil soup around the city. After Zeno began carrying the pot, Crates smashed it with his staff, splattering the lentil soup all over his surprised student. When Zeno began to run off in embarrassment, Crates chided, ""Why run away

The possible alternative is that what is to be achieved is to be achieved through practice, and of opinion, and of becoming indifferent to what is independent of the will. Perhaps you, /r/askphilosophy, may know how this can be done.

Perhaps what is to be achieved is to be achieved via a compromise between, the first possibility, the theoretical, and the second, the practical, and that Epictetus thinks that what is to be achieved can be achieved through mental exercises. However, again, again

So, according to Epictetus, a man is to remove his desire, cease to concern himself with what is ""independent of the will"" and how he is to alter his views?

1375259786.0,1jerz7,Does Ayn Rand ignore an axiomatic truth? Please help me understand The Fountainhead.,NormanOrville,25,5,46,"I'm having trouble understanding the sadomasochistic relationship Howard Roark shares with Dominique Francon and why Dominique is the way she is. She's a bizarre character and wouldn't make sense but that she represents ideas... except those ideas don't make sense. The soda-masochistic relationship is a quest for self contempt. Throughout the entire book she is on a quest for self-loathing Later

This is the part I don't get.

Dominique is obviously an individualist for most of the novel but during her marriage to Peter Keating she 'goes against herself' and adopts altruism that takes the shape of being utterly submissive to Keating.

This led me to question how Ayn Rand was defining altruism. My interpretation, in it's purest form, is to sacrifice ones integrity, morality, and soul for the greater good: humanity. It also assumes that it degrades the value of someone by implying they're weak enough to need you.

My problem with this is that there is a hierarchy of values and beliefs. I take it as an axiomatic truth that you can not go against your beliefs at the time of a value judgement. You can regret things. But at the time you made a judgement call the thing you value most is going to come out. Every decision requires a judgement. You will act on your beliefs. In order to act a certain way you must believe that is the best course of action for some reason... that reason is your belief. Despite the circumstances your actions are going to betray your beliefs. Even if someone is sticking a gun to your head and ordering you to kill hundreds of people with the push of a button you will make a value judgement. Even if you are a pacifist, I know, but is it wrong? 

This is relevant to Ayn Rands philosophy because in order for her idea of altruistic behaviour to exist you must sacrifice your wants and beliefs. You must put what you personally value last. I don't agree with that. When you make that judgement call to act altruistically you make that belief your own belief therefore... sacrificing nothing. It's really enlightened self interest. 

I really hope all that made sense but if it didn't

 So

I'm using Aristotle to say it is unethical because there are no virtues involved in selling yourself to perform sexual acts. Nothing noble in getting sodomized or sticking in lots of different people. It essentially a desire for money by whatever means necessary

Nietzsche proposes that you have to move beyond the lion and become a child

The problem arises in that the child, he is just one particularly positive school of it.

Is this a good explanation of why the later Wittgenstein thinks philosophy is confusion

""The meaning of a word is its use in the language"", there are countless possible meanings for any word determined by the various language games that use it). Is this why Wittgenstein claims philosophy is simply confusion?

So then Wittgenstein, when involved in a certain language game, we have an intuitive understanding (shown through social use and interaction) of the ""meaning"", or synonymously use, of its words, but any attempt to explicitly fix their meaning is misguided, because the ""meaning"", of any of its words is liable to change. 

Historical philosophy has then been that language game which takes words out of their native language games, so to speak, which is hopeless. It's like trying to scientifically determine the meaning of a painting.

1368554609.0,1ebti4,Regarding Abortion: A Fetus' Right to Life,Impune,25,8,56,"**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses! You've given me a lot to think about. I'm currently working on a (unrelated) final paper for school

I've just read Judith Jarvis Thomson's [""A Defense of Abortion""](http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/gedankenexperimente/Thomson_abortion/Thomson_abortion.pdf) [PDF

For those of you who haven't read the article and do not have time to do so now

* I. A fetus is a person;

* II. Every person has a right to life;

* III. Since every person has a right to life and a fetus is a person

* IV. Therefore


Thomson admits that she does not actually believe the above premises to be true, rests on illustrating how *even if* a fetus is a person with a right to life, IV may not follow from I-III. She does this by questioning whether we are operating with an accurate understanding of what ""right to life"" really means.

On page 12 (of the PDF file linked above) she writes:

&gt; The right to life consists not in the right not to be killed

This allows Thomson to argue that even if a fetus as a person has a right to life

You are kidnapped and awake after your abduction to find you have had your circulatory system connected with that of a world famous violinist. You are the only person on the planet with the blood type he requires to live, but he does not have the right to *your* kidneys (i.e. he does not have the right to those things which would allow him to persist). Therefore, if you were to unplug yourself from him and he were to die, you would have no violated his right to life because his death was not unjust: he had no right to the use of your body, and therefore you could not be accused of unjustly depriving him of it.

She also employs a story about coming down with a fatal fever. The only thing that could ever save her life would be the cold hand of [Henry Fonda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lljIrAfBzYs&amp;t=0m19s)'s brushing against her forehead. She may have a right to not die unjustly

The analogy to pregnancy should be obvious: Thomson is arguing that even if a fetus *does* have a right to life

**My Contention**

While I do see the benefits of interpreting ""the right to life"" as meaning ""the right not to be killed unjustly""––we rarely argue that those who commit gross violations against humanity have their right to life violated if they're sentenced to death for their crimes––I also cannot seem to understand her argument when it is applied to a fetus

The idea that a fetus rights against a thing who it could not exist without seems strange to me. My line of thought is as follows:

* I. The mother's body is the very source of a fetus' existence;

* II. Without the mother's body

* III. A fetus' right to life is contingent upon its existence (because rights cannot pre-exist their object);

* IV. Thomson's right to life emendation implies that fetuses have no rights to the things which are the source of its existence and continued persistence.

* V. If Thomson's right to life emendation denies a fetus' right to exist by virtue of denying its rights to the mother's body

This has turned into a *much* longer post than I had anticipated, and critiques.

I'm in a somewhat unfamiliar situation. I'm taking an Intro to Philosophy course in my last semester of college and have been asked for the final to write an 8-10 page essay on something we've studied. The topic is open ended, Kantian, Aristotelian, Existentialist (Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche), Relativist (Benedict)

I am more inclined to write on ethics

For example: 

In undergraduate literary essays we tend to address a particular text, will create an argument about the text based upon the language, motifs, imagery, etc. 

How then, if it is, generally refers or is based on the Philosopher's entire body of work? An understanding of any one of Nietzsche's ethical ideas, for example, appears to require a general conception of his entire Philosophical framework. In class this semester I've generally found that a more advanced understanding of one thinker generally leads to the realization that things are much more complex than they appear. Is there a way for a complete Philosophy noob to get around this and still create a reasonably tenable thesis? 

I am asking for guidance here. I hope this doesn't come off as a request for somebody to just write my paper for me. I intend to write it

I know that Absurdism differs from Nihilism in that while they come from the same premise - that existence has no intrinsic or ""real"" or universal meaning - Nihilism posits that meaning is nonexistent or entirely absent while Absurdism suggests that we have the ability to create our own meaning through the quest for meaning itself (Sisyphus's pushing the rock up the hill is the purpose of his life

If Meursault is meant to be a sort of embodiment of Absurdism (even if he's not conscious of it) and he kills someone solely because he felt inclined to do so, and we recognize the importance of adhering our own individual drives and impulses over that of the illusory structure of society, shouldn't we implicitly recognize that every other person on earth is also trying to do the same? That they are on their own quest just like we are, and even if we don't respect socially imposed values or morals (like don't kill on the basis that society says it's bad) shouldn't we not kill on the basis of our own humanity, and our recognition of the humanity of everyone else on earth, and the sameness between us which lies therein?

For example: 

The economics profession appears to have been unaware of the long build-up to the current worldwide financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our view, disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.  

http://www.ifw-members.ifw-kiel....

Another example: 

Accounting practices are deeply implicated in the current financial crisis and in proposals for recapitalizing financial institutions and restoring stability to the global financial system. This essay discusses the methodological and theoretical gaps in accounting research that explain our failure to anticipate the crisis and limit our ability to analyze and respond to it.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci...

Another example: 

The failure of academic finance can be considered one of the symbols of the financial crisis. Two important underlying reasons why academic finance models systematically fail to account for real-world phenomena follow directly from two conventions: (a) treating economics not as a 'true' social science (but as a branch of applied mathematics inspired by the methodology of classical physics); and (b) using economic models as if the empirical content of economic theories is not very low. Failure to understand and appreciate the inherent weaknesses of these 'conventions' had fatal consequences for the use and interpretation of key academic finance concepts and models by market practitioners and policymakers. Theoretical constructs such as the efficient markets hypothesis, investors, and business managers was made worse by sins of omission - the failure of academics to communicate the limitations of their models and to warn against (potential) misuses of their research - and sins of commission - introducing (often implicitly) ideological or biased features in research programs Hence, the deeper problem with finance concepts such as the 'efficient markets hypothesis' and 'ratex theory' is not that they are based on assumptions that are considered as not being 'realistic'. The real issue at stake with academic finance is not a quarrel about the validity of the assumption of rational behavior but the inherent semantical insufficiency of economic theories that implies a low empirical content (and a high degree of specification uncertainty). This perspective makes the scientific approach advocated by Friedman and others less straightforward. In addition, there is wide-spread failure to incorporate the key implications of economics as a social science. As response to these 'weaknesses' and challenges, five suggested principles or guidelines for future research programmes are outlined.

[Here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/t20tu/need_help_with_this_nietzsche_passage/) then, is a link to the original thread. Hope it's helpful.

**EDIT:** *The original poster also deleted the Nietzsche passage they'd quoted from their original post. Here is is

&gt; The Genius of the Species? *The Gay Science*

&gt; The problem of consciousness (or more correctly: of becoming conscious of oneself) meets us only when we begin to perceive in what measure we could dispense with it: and it is at the beginning of this perception that we are now placed by physiology and zoology (which have thus required two centuries to over take the hint thrown out in advance by Leibnitz).  For we could in fact think, and recollect, we could likewise ""act"" in every sense of the term, and nevertheless nothing of it all need necessarily ""come into consciousness"" (as one says metaphorically).  The whole of life would be possible without its seeing itself as it were in a mirror: as in fact even at present the far greater part of our life still goes on without this mirroring, and even our thinking, feeling, volitional life as well

&gt; What then is the purpose of consciousness generally, that the subtlety and strength of consciousness are always in proportion to the capacity for communication of a man (or an animal), the capacity for communication in its turn being in proportion to the necessity for communication: the latter not to be understood as if precisely the individual himself who is master in the art of communicating and making known his necessities would at the same time have to be most dependent upon others for his necessities seems to me however to be so in relation to whole races and successions of generations: where necessity and need have long compelled men to communicate with their fellows and understand each other rapidly and subtly, a surplus of the power and art of communication is at last acquired as if it were a fortune which had gradually accumulated, and now waited for an heir to squander it prodigally (the so called artists are these heirs in like manner the orators, preachers, and authors: all of them men who come at the end of a long succession, in the best sense of the word

&gt; Granted that this observation correct, feelings and emotions come within the range of our consciousness at least a part of them - is the result of a terrible, prolonged ""must"" ruling man s destiny: as the most endangered animal he needed help and protection; he needed his fellows, he was obliged to express his distress, he had to know how to make himself understood and for all this he needed ""consciousness"" first of all: he had to ""know"" himself what he lacked, to ""know"" how he felt, and to "" know "" what he thought.

&gt; For, like every living creature, thinks unceasingly, but does not know it; the thinking which is becoming conscious of itself is only the smallest part thereof, we may say, the most superficial part, the worst part: for this conscious thinking alone is done in words, in the symbols for communication, but also the looks, has increased in proportion as the necessity has increased for communicating them to others by means of signs.  The sign-inventing man is at the same time the man who is always more acutely self-conscious; it is only as a social animal that man has learned to become conscious of himself

&gt; My idea is, but rather to the social and gregarious nature in him; that, as follows from this, it is only in relation to communal and gregarious utility that it is finely developed; and that consequently each of us, in spite of the best intention of understanding himself as individually as possible, and of ""knowing himself” will always just call into consciousness the non-individual in him, namely, unique and absolutely individual there is no doubt about it; but as soon as we translate them into consciousness, relatively stupid, radical perversion

&gt; Finally, it is not the antithesis of subject and object with which I am here concerned: I leave that distinction to the epistemologists who have remained entangled in the toils of grammar (popular metaphysics).  It is still less the antithesis of ""thing in itself"" and phenomenon, for we do not ""know"" enough to be entitled even to make such a distinction.  Indeed, we have not any organ at all for knowledge or for ""truth"": we ""know"" (or believe, or imagine) just as much as may be of use in the interest of the human herd, the species; and even what is here called ""usefulness"" is ultimately only a belief, something fanciful and perhaps precisely the most fatal stupidity by which we shall one day perish.

The question I'm doing is about the relationship between the mass media and a democratic society. My ideas are based around the benefits and the down sides to tougher regulation on mass media and more involvement from the state.

Basically my arguments are:

* Media/government are close bed fellows

* The media can be both beneficial and detrimental to a healthy democracy

* Tougher regulation would be seen

* From a Marxist perspective

* Regulation/state involvement would result in less cover ups/scandals - citing the recent Leveson Enquiry and the news of the Hillsborough cover up being brought to light

*However* allowing a media that is less regulated/totally free could be just as bad for democracy as it gives them greater power to decide what we hear about and are allowed to know. There's potential for more and greater cover ups/scandals

The most interesting ideas in his work

* Because God does not exist
* Consciousness, complete ""being-in-itself"", like things in the world, or like our idea of God. Being-it-itself describes inanimate and unconscious matter, which is simply there without explanation or purpose.
* Sartre rejects God (or perfection) because He would have to simultaneously be being-for-itself and being-in-itself, their goal is to be conscious but not have to bear incompleteness or the responsibility of freedom. This goal will always be frustrated according to Sartre.
* When humans strive to achieve perfection or satisfaction, a significant other, etc.) that we lose awareness of our identity  and duty to make authentic choices for ourselves. It is self-deception -- a strange activity where a person-lied-to and the liar are somehow the same person.
* Vertigo / Anguish: similar to Kierkegaard's anxiety. Sartre describes a feeling of dizziness when we realize that we have total control over the unfolding of our lives in an absurd world. For instance
* The Self is not a stable, and proposes future selves. It can only exist by reference to other beings. Unlike Descartes, Sartre thinks that if the world disappeared, so would consciousness, because the observer is dependent on its relationship to what it isn't. There cannot even be a pure Cartesian thinker, because of intentionality of thought.
* all of our relationships with other people are basically just a way to feel objectified or objectify others. Even when we help others, we ultimately fail because they also have the ability to choose; we cannot take away their existential freedom unless they allow us to.
* we are totally responsible for even strong emotions, depression, hatred, etc. They aren't just bodily functions, but states of mind which we intentionally take on to derive meaning from events that happen to us. They aren't simply the result of Freudian urges or biological drives. We tend not to just let emotions happen, but to USE emotions as an excuse to avoid making choices that we should. I wholly disagree with this part of Sartre's thought, but it's still cool to consider.

In my opinion, considering that medical access is to try to ensure the life of a person, denying medication or surgery that could double, triple, etc. the life would be letting someone die. In contrast, it would be both cruel and unusual to force such science on anyone, especially those serving a ""life"" sentence.

I also think that sentences that are usually deemed impossible to serve, however I think it would also be necessary for prisons to provide better integration since a lot can change in 300 years. I am curious, however, how sentencing would be affected. Not only do I believe that there would be an increase of life sentences, I also think fear would spread of people serving sentences that would normally release them as an old, weak person when they can take a pill or get some surgery to become a strong, youthful citizen yet again.

* Therefore a Maximally Great Being exists in our world.

Examining ""Maximally Great Being""

* A being is Maximally Great if it is Maximally Good in all possible worlds.

* If a Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in one possible world
* A Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in one possible world.

* Therefore a Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in our world.

there seem to be philosophers who think well of this argument. If it had such an obvious flaw

&gt;Suppose that two students, while Sam consistently fails any work he is set. Mark has attended the lessons in preparation for the test, while Sam has been absent due to illness.

Mark says that the test went well, while Sam says that he didn’t even understand the question.

&gt;Reflecting on the test, he is justified in believing it; he has excellent evidence that Mark will get the highest grade on the test, and can see from the cover of his copy of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn that it was written by Mark Twain. Furthermore, the belief is true; the student that will get the highest grade on the test does indeed share a name with the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” According to the tripartite theory of knowledge, therefore, Sam knows that the student that will get the highest grade on the test shares a name with the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

&gt;Sam, despite his excellent grades in the past, perfect attendance, hours of revision, furious writing, and confidence, failed the test. He did not appreciate the subtlety of the question, on the other hand, and pessimism concerning his performance, got the highest grade on the test.
Unknown to Sam, who used the pseudonym Mark Twain, was in fact called Samuel Clemens. Sam, therefore, who is the student who will get the highest grade on the test, does share a name with the author of Huckleberry Finn.

What I don't get, which is the justification for believing he who shares a name with the author of the book will get the best mark). The new truth which the TTK supposedly counts as knowledge (that Sam 'knew' the one with the shared name would do better) is based purely off coincidence over the fact that the justification was for a different truth but happened to justify the relevant truth.

Hello everyone

I was helping a student with a paper for her Introduction to Ethics course

Those who say yes basically make the claim that having (even minimal) hearing is objectively better than being deaf. I am inclined to agree, however, because parents can still (and possibly should) learn sign language.

I think I disagree with this position, in turn, also sets back their overall ability to learn about any topic (mathematics, history, art, science, etc.).

Second, that the child is nowhere near capable of making that decision, but I think the outcomes are adequately problematic to warrant against making the decision *for* them. Likewise, the deaf community has a rich culture and language that is ever shrinking with such technological advancements. This might be a good thing if hearing is objectively better than not hearing, but something about it just seems wrong to me.

What is a panelist?
---

AskPhilosophy is structured on the [AskScience](/r/AskScience) model

What's expected of a panelist?
---

Panelists should make sure they're subscribed to AskPhilosophy, if you offer an answer to a question, you should also up vote the question.

Panelists should make an effort to first of all answer questions as representatives of the field, summarize the relevant argument, and explain key concepts in terms appropriate for a general audience.

What are the qualifications?
---

The main qualification is a willingness to check the new queue often, a link to a picture or personal page (blog or tweet) with the message ""Hi, AskReddit!"" ought to do it.

Like AskScience, your status may be either downgraded or revoked at the discretion of the moderators. Additionally, answers should also be polite, discussions should aim at being helpful, and a panelist who consistently or egregiously violates either of those norms may be removed.

How do I recognize a panelist?
---

Panelists are distinguished from other users by the addition of ""flair"" to their names. A panelists flair is also used to indicate their field of expertise and the degree of involvement that characterizes their background.

When you request to be added to the panel, graduate, undergraduate, or autodidact. For more on those categories, see the [flair description page](http://redd.it/mext6). Requests sent to the moderators without that information may be ignored by the moderators as an indication that the requester did not bother to familiarize themselves with what's expected of panelists.

To play devil's advocate

* We determined that the reason why she feels the way she does is because she believes that one must not restrict the choice of others, that her eating has taken vital resources away from someone whose life utterly depends on it.  Wouldn't this mean that, strictly applying her own reasoning, it is ethically indefensible to eat anything more than the absolute basic necessities required for survival?

* We also determined that an analogous problem would arise from a ""too few lifeboats"" scenario.  Suppose you are on a sinking ship, and putting even one extra person in a lifeboat will sink it.  Nobody volunteers to sacrifice themselves for the good of others, so it's a free-for-all and it just so happens that you are the last person off the ship.  Now, by my girlfriend's reasoning, it is not unethical for you to choose to jump on to one lifeboat anyway, likely sinking it and killing half the passengers, since you are trying to save yourself.

Why is your state denying you the use of drugs and having the capability to become obese unethical, if doing the same yourself isn't?

1. Explain why I believe in incompatibility

2. Criticise the arguments of those that I *disagree* with
*agree* with.

3. Explain that moral responsibility is a huge problem for believing in determinism.

4. A solution to this problem: ???

I get stuck at this point. It seems like I'm either going to have to come up with a ground-breaking idea that will solve this debate (which I think is *highly* unlikely!) or base my dissertation around analysing the work of a particular philosopher who endorses free will / compatibilism. The problem with that, thus my dissertation won't be of any new material. Is determinism a dead subject? Or am I missing something obvious, topic-wise?

1326692616.0,oiy7w,Is Hume's argument regarding Miracles circular? ,sethosayher,14,0,8,"Hey guys

I've been reading ""Why I became an Atheist"" by John Loftus

http://imgur.com/a/O3s3R

Here's what I make of this:

Hume's critics argue that his claim that ""uniform experience"" is against the occurrence of miracles begs the question

What Fogelin (and John W. Loftus) are saying is that this is a misreading of Hume's argument...Fogelin goes on to state in his book on Hume's Defense of Miracles that most claims of circularity regarding this argument see Hume making the claim that a priori miracles are impossible

I still don't full understand Loftus' (and Fogelin's) retort to C.S. Lewis

edit: So let try to understand this...when Hume is speaking about ""uniform experience

edit 2: This is another question all together

Lets say an Evangelical Preacher claims he can cure the sick. And appears to do so

In this instance the chance of a cancer going into spontaneous remission appears to be greater than the chance that this preacher has somehow suspended natural law

But what if this preacher consistently and repeatedly heals the sick? And does so under the scrutiny of attentive scientists and doctors? What if he cures 10

Would the possibility of his actually performing a miracle be greater than the chance that this is all just coincidence? How would we begin calculating that?

He said that he was not going to get married until homosexuals were legally able to in every state (we both live in the USA), I did disagree on the importance of what he was doing. I said that I personally felt 'not doing something' in protest of any issue, when not also accompanied by any other actions where you are actively doing something (such as writing letters to the people with the power to change things, donating to the cause, etc etc,) didn't seem to further the cause. I don't think it's wrong to do, or bad, I just thought that it didn't seem to do much of anything. Again

Anyway, as well as whether or not I support their rights, or whether or not I support the abuse of their rights.

He supported his argument by saying ""You take advantage of your rights, lease a chapel, and the only person that wants gays to marry is the caterer. Maybe. Why would I ever support those people with my money?""

While I do agree he has a point with the 'showing my support (or lack thereof) with my money' thing

So, are as follows:

1.) Is it ethical, if marriage is considered a right, and not everyone is actually afforded that right?
2.) Is it ethical to take advantage of any right you are given if not everyone has that same right?
3.) Is it ethical to take advantage of any PRIVILEGES you are given if not everyone has that same privilege?

I recognize that not everyone views ethics the same way, or the opportunity to really ask any questions because he pretty much stopped responding with anything more than ""Stop talking to me about this"" fairly straightaway. I'm not doing this to try and prove either of us are right and I don't intend on ever bringing this up with him again, as it was clearly just not a topic he was willing to discuss with me, given my personal viewpoints I had put forth. I was just thinking about it this morning and wondered about his arguments about how ethical all these things were.

1351369168.0,126qsu,Why Freewill Cannot Exist in a Material Universe,veryhungryboy,20,7,11,"Can you help provide me with some criticisms of this essay? I'm trying to use quantum indeterminacy to argue against it but it leads to randomness

Freewill, whereas freewill is almost universally-accepted as fact. However, I aim to show that freewill is a concept no less metaphysical than any religious deity. 

Let us first reject any metaphysical interpretations of the universe, neutrons and electrons. We then infer that the whole of this material universe is subject to certain immutable laws that govern the interactions of matter, such as Einstein’s Theories of General and Special Relativity and, above all, the Laws of Cause and Effect. These laws are unchanging, eternal and all-encompassing and so they provide a strong model from which to view the universe. These eternal and unbreakable laws suggest a deterministic view of the material universe, whereby every cause produces a specific and determined effect and a different outcome is impossible. The nature of the cause determines the nature of the effect absolutely, it would produce exactly the same effect. When this premise is extended to encompass the entirety of the universe, theoretically, could logically infer the past and the future using the laws of the universe. We view the happenings of the universe as unpredictable and undetermined because we do not yet understand enough of the universe and its laws. However

We must next accept that humans are inextricably part of this material world and so we too are governed by the laws of the universe. We are made up of the very same stuff as the stars and the ground and so we are subject to the very same laws. Humans seems to have no problem accepting that their bodies are governed by universal laws, it follows that our minds are purely material. Our minds are located in space and they are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. Just as the wider universe has laws to govern its interactions, so must the mind, and I believe it is because we do not yet understand these laws of the mind that we propagate the notion of freewill. The mind is a complex system, governed by complex laws that determine our actions, and the ‘freewill’ we feel is these complex laws being applied to our present situation. There are countless instances of humans inventing concepts to cover our lack of understanding, and I believe freewill to be one of these concepts. One such example of this is the weather. The weather used to be quite unpredictable and unexplainable and, and we can use these causes to predict (relatively) accurately what the weather will be. At the present moment

Now let us more critically analyse the process of decision-making. When choosing between two alternatives, that the present situation is entirely outside your control. It is one domino in the infinite chain of dominoes. It has been brought about exclusively by the laws of the universe, and could never be any other way. It is clear that there is no freedom to be gained from the present situation. Your past experiences are similarly uncontrollable. You do not decide where or when you are born and from that moment, all your past experiences were previously present situations: present situations over which you have no control. So any possible source of freedom lies in the way you interpret the present situation; how your mind interacts with it. However, we’ve already asserted that the mind interacts with decisions through certain laws: immutable, eternal and all-encompassing laws. There is no room for freedom in this picture. Your mind never could have decided differently. The process of decision-making is simply your mind applying its laws to your present situation.
These premises logically lead on to a psychologically deterministic view of the mind. By applying the laws of cause and effect onto the mind we necessarily infer that all psychological states and events are caused by previously existing psychological states and events. Psychological determinists assert that all decisions are caused by previously existing psychological factors, is evidence that the laws of the mind are uniform and that we already have a general idea of what they are. 

From this we must conclude that the concept of freewill is incoherent within a purely material universe. A universe consisting exclusively of atoms and governed by cause and effect is a determined universe. We as humans would be trapped in a chain of cause of effect which determines all our decisions for us. For freewill to exist, because to be truly free is to act without a cause, to create something from nothing.

One of the big debates among historians in the twentieth century, I have always assumed that the existence of an objective truth is axiomatic, but it seems that I have been shaped by the culture of Western Enlightenment. 

The way I figure it the statement “There is no objective truth” has some problems

* “There is no objective truth” is a negative claim and if there is even one thing that can be shown to be objectively true then the initial statement is false.

* “There is no objective truth” is by definition self negating. In order for it to be true

To be clear

However, the veracity is outside the observation. The accuracy of the observational method, the social or cultural biases of the observer, and the context in which the observation was made can lead an observer to describe a sloup as frozy, but that doesn’t *make* the sloup frozy, the observation was just wrong.

Am I making any sense?

I am not even sure that I am in the right place or that im asking the right question. Maybe one of you esteemed thinkers could help me find the right question.

So to figure out why I'm asking the question here is a little about me. 
From the outside I imagine my life looks quite normal. I am 28 years old. I have a wife and a  year old son. I have held a low paying job (14 dollars CAD hour) for 6 years now. I deal with technology and computer taking hardware our company produces and putting it together with our software.

One of the greatest things going for me in my life is my family. I know beyond a doubt that my parents 
I am well liked and in my whole life there are only 2 people that I can remember that do not like me. I can make most people laugh in almost any situation or conversation as long as they don't have a block setup against laughing (horrible moods or example)


If you were to take a closer look at my life I think society would find me a failure. Born to parents who worked their way from almost poverty to a comfortable spot in the middle class. Some would even say they are upper middle class.  
Now me and my wife are living paycheck to paycheck. I do not have anything of great value to show for myself. My wife works part time on weekends but that doesn't help much. My credit rating is bad from an old debt i took too long to pay off. I have 0 debt at this time.
My health is in the gutter as I recently had a bad episode with my back and the pain while it has decreased has gone chronic. I smoke both cigarettes and pot and am overweight. 

At the slightest criticisms my wife goes overboard emotionally. If I mention something like that she could clean the house when she is home all week alone with our son  or that dinner would be nice after work

I feel that you would think of me as very lazy.

I feel that if it wasn't for my parents and their monetary assistance for us we could have ended up on the street years ago. I feel that I am failing at life and I have had this feeling sometimes stronger sometimes weaker since I was 14 -15 or so and realized how big and tough the world is.


When it comes down to it I am sure that it is Me that is holding me back and I am afraid of what might happen should I loose my parents and the support they represent.


Thusly I need to better my life but I just can't seems to think of the proper steps of the proper way to get into a better situation.
This I am sure comes down to my way of thinking.

I will now try to describe or give examples on how I think.

All my life people have been telling me that I say weird things. While this can often be interpreted as funny it gives me huge issues in holding a conversation.  

The only time I can eagerly talk about a topic is when its about video gaming. Even then the vast majority of it is me and my partner spewing random facts at each other. Like how good on game is. What another game is all about. And I will receive the same style of fact answers back. Is this conversation? The spewing of facts and maybe the odd question about the topic?

What is a conversation even beyond the statement of facts? 
Why is it so incredibly easy for my parents to strike up a dinner conversation yet awkward silence is no stranger to me?

I like to think I'm smart. I love going on the web and reading about  ancient History and pre history. I love reading and watching shows about science especially physics. I can regurgitate facts from this stuff easy enough  but that doesn't mean that i can draw my own conclusions.

As far as what's going on in my head its mostly blank. I do so much on instinct even at work with no. For example this text I wrote here is a great example. It poured from my fingers and my voice in my head only narrated it as I wrote it down and spoke as I reread the lines of text. There was the odd popup thought of something to add or to change.   

How do you as a philosopher think?  Do you have constant narration inside of you that argues out points. Is it ever still inside of you like it is in my head?


**EDIT:**

A great thank you to everyone that has responded.  There is a lot of information that you all have given me since I originally asked my question. So much in fact that I have not been able to digest it all properly yet.  However I want you all to know that I have read every single post and I am taking your answers very seriously.

What I need to do now is create a road map for myself. A plan to follow up on the seeds of knowledge you gave me.

[This wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_%28logic%29) offers an example problem with people on an island figuring out the eye color of other people on the island.

If I understand it, however, if one finds out their eye color they must leave the island the following day. This is also public knowledge. So, a stranger comes to the island and states that he sees someone with blue eyes. This fact now becomes public knowledge. The truth is that there are 100 people with blue eyes, and, according to the answer of the problem, on the 100th day after the stranger revels his observation all the people with blue eyes will leave the island.

Wiki offers an induction proof saying if there were only one person with blue eyes then the person with blue eyes can figure out it is himself who must leave. If there are two blue eyed people

However... This second step of the induction makes certain extra claims of public knowledge. Namely it assumes that everyone knows that everyone can see color (for example) It also assumes that everyone takes time to even look at other people's eyes and so on. IE it assumes it is public knowledge that everyone already knows what everyone's eye color is. But that makes what the stranger said redundant. IE,False,,t5_2sc5r,False,,,t3_ntiys

Essentially, so all a mathematical proof can achieve is to establish that ""Everything on *this* side of the equation is equal to everything on *that* side of the equation, *for no reason other than the fact that it is consistent with the axioms we have assumed*"". The body of the proof is surely just the repeated statement that ""We rephrase this relationship in *this* way, *this* way and finally in *this* way, which means that we have established that it is *definitely* consistent with the axioms we have assumed"".

Granted, and that this constitutes new knowledge. For instance, if c is the speed of light, then every equation incorporating c tells us something about the physical behaviour of light. But as soon as we do this, we're practising physics or some other field, and no longer pure mathematics. The knowledge we have gained is about the physical world, and not about the structure of mathematics.

I think the best way to explain what I mean is to ask this: Why can't I just pick a different set of axioms and begin a field of 'alternative maths'? I understand that it wouldn't be useful for describing and predicting real-world phenomena as 'real maths' is

Instead of, because each mind is different and if you are independent you should choose to believe whatever you want to believe regardless of what religion that may fit into. To say you are ""Christian"" limits you, and makes you think, I can only believe what this box allows me to believe and I must believe everything in this box otherwise I am not in this box, I am in a different box. Which I believe to be an unhealthy way to think and live because you shackle yourself when you could be so much more free in thought than you are, and you only have yourself to blame.

The unfortunate trouble arises when a group of people hold the same views as I because then there is the danger of us labelling ourselves as "" the people who don't believe in labels"". This is completely contradictory and defeats the entire point of the beliefs I hold. This makes us the people outside the box, just means we put our box in a different place. Therefore it is regrettable that I must conclude that the labelling of every possible thing we come into contact with, no matter how much I may dislike it is inescapable and inevitable.

I suppose I should begin by saying that what drew me to pragmatism as a philosophy was an inclination towards scientific instrumentalism. Whilst there are obvious differences between the two, the emphasis on empirical adequacy over ontological correctness in instrumentalism mirrors the pragmatist's definition of truth; ""Any idea upon which we can ride …; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally"" (James

My main question, as already discussed, the pragmatic position seems so close to the instrumentalist's that one would be forgiven for mistaking them as identical. On the other, it appears that embracing the pragmatic definition of truth would demand one to accept scientific realism as 'true'. I say this for belief in scientific realism certainly aids us in ""linking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor"" et cetera.

Might the pragmatist accept the assertion that scientific realism is true, and yet still maintain that it is the most ontologically correct/representative picture of reality?

I do apologise if it seems at times like I've accepted scientific instrumentalism straight off the bat

Edit: Can I ask another quick question seeing as I don't think this warrants another thread on its own? How is the pragmatic maxim not just an early (disguised) form of verificationism (not Ayer's, speaks not only of verification a great deal, but also of the pragmatic maxim being a criterion of meaning. Here's a quote from Peice which puts the pragmatic maxim quite concisely;

Why must a man put aside his senses to understand the wax? All that is important in the idea of the wax (at least in my opinion) is all of the information that my senses give me. To say that I must disregard my only tools for understanding seems odd to me. My senses are the only things that allow me to make sense of anything

Nietzsche, says that man doesn't need a higher being to provide him with a moral code. The super-ego can do that, and from there you have the super-man who is free of God.

1344592529.0,xznbp,Biggest philosophical ideas,Froolow,15,4,10,"Hi all

Graduate philosopher who specialised in Philosophy of Science here. I'm about to go on to do an MSc

The way I was going to do it was to take 'big' philosophical ideas and condense them into a short story, but I firmly believe that the reason philosophy is important is that it's universal; anyone can understand the issues if they are presented clearly enough, and that philosophy is important instrumentally to make you a better thinker.

An easy example is Theseus' ship - I could tell a story about this ship, and most of the crew have retired, and the bottom has to be replaced every few years. I'd ask the kids whether they think it *is* the same ship, and why they think it is or isn't. I'll talk to them about how their bodies are constantly changing, and ask if bodies are like ships. If I'm feeling particularly teachery I might get them to make a 'Theseus' Ship' out of lego and change it *just enough* that their contraption is a 'different' lego model to before. Nothing that will shake the field to its foundations, but also probably something the kids won't have thought about before which is hopefully interesting for them and gets them to think about philosophy come degree-picking time.
