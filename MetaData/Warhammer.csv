I present to you [a Skaven Emergence Hole]( http://imgur.com/a/IYrE1)

My last couple projects have been bastardized versions of things I found guides for online, but I'm not sure it's a viable army yet).

All of the Skaven terrain I see online is defiled and defaced Dwarf ruins, and busted statuary; I started wondering what would happen if the Skaven needed to get topside somewhere in the wilds of the Empire (or anywhere away from the mountains, really).

Skaven have lots of cool lore, and that is probably what happened to the villages.  The ones that were depopulated would have the populace taken underground via a nearby hole.  I got thinking about these holes and how if it were hidden away from the eyes of citizens and soldiery, it could be maintained and built to more efficiently move troops, slaves, gear, and supplies from the Under Empire to the surface and vice versa.

I took WIP Shots

I plan on having a campaign with my buddy using my Skaven, but the skaven don't really fight on their own turf. So if my enemy manages to destroy my Emergence Hole (or holes if it is a big campaign) I lose since my invasion has been stemmed.

Descriptive List:

1. - [Games Workshop](http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/home.jsp) - Ah Games Workshop. We all know them
CONTAINS: SCI-FI

2 - [Mega Miniatures](http://www.megaminis.com/) - A massive group of miniatures all cast in white metal. They've been in the business for a decade, [cyborgs](http://freeboardgamesnow.com/sciencefictionandroidcult.aspx), and [robots](http://freeboardgamesnow.com/sciencefictionasteroidminers.aspx), as well as some fantasy style stuff like [monsters](http://freeboardgamesnow.com/fantasymonsters.aspx), [Humans]freeboardgamesnow.com/fantasyhumannpc.aspx), and [Human Cavalry](http://freeboardgamesnow.com/fantasycavalry.aspx).
CONTAINS SCI-FI

3 - [Miniature Scenery](http://www.miniaturescenery.com/index.asp) - This site is full of scenery pieces made from a CNC printer and only need to be assembled. The range isn't large but they're a really good price, door handles, and rivets. CONTAINS SCI-FI TERRAIN, FANTASY TERRAIN

4 - [Infinity](http://infinitythegame.com/store/en/) - specifically for the game Infinity

5 - [Pig Iron Productions](http://www.pig-iron-productions.com/) - This is a line of plastic minis of human soldiers - an excellent choice for [stormtroopers](http://www.pig-iron-productions.com/pi2-heavy-infantry-assault-squad-p-25.html)

6 - [Urban War](http://www.urbanwarthegame.com/news.php) - Previously known as Void (about the same time as WH40K 3rd ed), [cyborgs](http://www.urbanwarthegame.com/store-ecwid.php#!/~/product/category=4393475&amp;id=18890430), [human soldiers](http://www.urbanwarthegame.com/store-ecwid.php#!/~/product/category=4393475&amp;id=18890426), [future soldiers](http://www.urbanwarthegame.com/store-ecwid.php#!/~/product/category=4393475&amp;id=18890434), and their [army of Judge Dredds](http://www.urbanwarthegame.com/store-ecwid.php#!/~/product/category=4393475&amp;id=18890433) (of which I have several of their older models). I wish they would come state-side, but unfortunately they seem to be happier on the internet. Cool models either way, and a very sizable store. CONTAINS: SCI-FI

7 - [Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear](http://www.dp9.com/) - a huge treat for any mecha lover, but it's a large line of cool miniatures. CONTAINS: SCI-FI

8 - [Heresy Miniatures](http://heresyminiatures.com/) - a large line of fantasy and sci-fi related minis. They've got a large amount of [excellent human troopers](http://www.heresyminiatures.com/shop/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=2_14), FANTASY

9 - [Privateer Press](http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/) - Your steampunk/fantasy alternative to Warhammer- Warmachine and Hoards! Popular in the states already (not sure about the rest of the world) Privateer Press has grown prodigiously over the last few years and has a list of minis that anyone would be proud of - [Steampunk](http://store.privateerpress.com/warmachineplasticbattleboxes.aspx) to the left, STEAMPUNK

10 - [MaxMini](http://www.maxmini.eu/) - Maxmini has a few [miniatures](http://www.maxmini.eu/store/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=15)

11 - [Burn In Designs](http://www.burnindesigns.net/) - Another terrain manufacturer; they make a large number of laser engraved wood terrain from [old west towns](http://www.burnindesigns.net/2012/10/welcome-to-rock-ridge.html), WESTERN TERRAIN

12 - [Anvil Industries](http://www.anvilindustry.co.uk/index.php?route=common/home) - [totally **NOT** space marines](http://www.anvilindustry.co.uk/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_107) - [Nope](http://www.anvilindustry.co.uk/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_106). These all look brilliant

13 - [Puppetswar](http://puppetswar.eu/) - More not [Space](http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=210) [Marines](http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=200) which all apparently come with holes premade for magnetization! I haven't had as much time to look over this range of minis as the others (I only found this a few days ago -today, and a [couple](http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=192) of [flyers](http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=187) and [alternate tank weapons](http://puppetswar.eu/product.php?id_product=40), they've got a lot of things to take a look at. Also have alt [space elf](http://puppetswar.eu/category.php?id_category=50) and [space ork](http://puppetswar.eu/category.php?id_category=51) stuff as well as stuff. Lots more I'm not mentioning as well! CONTAINS: SCI-FI

14 - [Fantization Miniatures](http://www.fantization.com/tabletopminiatures.aspx). Appears to be more of a distributor than anything else. About 70 some lines of minis including some of the ones already listed here. Some of their entries don't seem to be as descriptive or complete as the manufacturer's website

15 - [Hirst Arts Fantasy Architecture Inc](http://www.hirstarts.com/) - Like lots of terrain but hate paying for large amounts of it? [How about a mold?](http://www.hirstarts.com/moldmake/moldmaking.html#silicone) Quite frankly I'm blown away right now at the [sheer variety available](http://www.hirstarts.com/projects.html). Their online store is accessible [here](https://store.hirstarts.com/mm5/merchant.mvc), FANTASY TERRAIN

16 - [Reaper Miniatures](http://www.reapermini.com/) - ye gods, to [cyberpunk/displaced in time](http://www.reapermini.com/Miniatures/Chronoscope), to [mechs](http://www.reapermini.com/Miniatures/CAV:StrikeOperations). Also, I have to plug their [Bones](http://www.reapermini.com/Miniatures/Bones) line- recently wanting to move from metal to the lighter and cheaper plastic, a kickstarter was made to get their new plastic casting machines made instead of phasing them in slowly. Their target was 30k; [they raised almost 3.5 million dollars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1513061270/reaper-miniatures-bones-an-evolution-of-gaming-min). I personally love Reaper and have been buying them for years- while they're less good for making a whole platoon/army, they're excellent for single characters or for NPCs, monsters

17 - [Raging Heroes](http://www.ragingheroes.com/) - Cyber wolves, if their kickstarter becomes part of their standard line of minis, I'd buy them up in a moment; because they're all female soldiers. Curious thinking about it this way, but apparently female soldiers are damned near impossible to find in warfare- at least on the table top. Their [sci-fi commander sculpts](http://www.ragingheroes.com/collections/the-kurganovas/products/kurganovas-sf) is excellently done, though, albeit with a bit more fetish than armor for what I prefer. CONTAINS: SCI-FI, FANTASY

18 - [Epicast](http://www.epicast.com/) - I was considering including these guys for the longest time, if their store isn't so broken you can manage to find out what you're buying.

19 - [Forge World](http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/) - Again for the sake of completeness, they're made of resin.

20 - [Ares Mythologic](http://www.aresmythologic.com/v2/en/) - Who doesn't love 54mm miniatures? I certainly do - [Detail](http://www.aresmythologic.com/v2/en/dark-world/105-dw-03-christin.html), you wouldn't want to for these guys. They're [set pieces](http://www.aresmythologic.com/v2/en/dark-world/98-dw-01-jhonn-creek.html) and the kind of thing that you'd love to use in an RPG if you ever find enough of them to use. CONTAINS SCI-FI, LOTS OF FANTASY

Now, really, really geeky. The guy who I played (We'll call him Brian) had the same issues, but had a lot of money and an entire upstairs loft in his big-ass house dedicated to his geekdom, which involved a lot of historic crap, wargames, and ornamental weaponry. He was also a gigantic tool. He 'made his own' guard army, he had +1 to BS and several other special rules which at the time, rough, btw) and out-ranging his super shooty army. After capturing all the objectives on the table

Brian, we often referred to the imperium as being somewhat nazi-like. As time went on, Brian became more of a rules-lawyer, pointing out any mistake I made with brutal efficiency, and also made more and more ridiculous demands while I was taking my turn, such as 'move your book, I can't see' or 'Don't put your shoes on that, which Brian IMMEDIATELY demanded that I put down. I ignored him, and play the game.

**Brian stood up

I didn't take this lightly

After getting my shit together, Brian comes downstairs to demand that I get out right now, shoes or no shoes. When I tell him, effectively, to eat a dick, **he picks up my box of models and hurls it onto the floor.** Now let that sink in. This was, roughly, modeling, where I delivered several hard right hooks to the side of his face before he ran off screaming.


To this day, but I just didn't want to do it anymore. I had lost any attraction to them that I initially had, and I sold them all for a lot cheaper than I had paid, just to be rid of them. It took 10 years before I ever bought another model, and even then, I hadn't picked up a 40k army until last month when I bought a rhino and a tactical squad to begin again.
