I emailed him then and got no response. Since then, his divorce, his niece's wedding, and his job. A few weeks ago, his niece (who works at Neiman Marcus) emailed me thanking me for the wedding gift and telling me about a potential job. Of course I replied asking for information about the job. She then emailed the person with the job and CC'ed me. I replied to them with this:

*I am not your uncle (as far as I know) and have never worked jewelry sales. I have tried repeatedly to get &lt;his email address&gt; to stop CCing me on emails to his divorce attorney and to correct wherever it is that he has published this to be his email address. This is not his address. I am not he.*

*If he gave you this email address

*I have been getting email intended for him for years and have just discovered in the past six months who he is. I have tried to get him to correct this problem, his domestic issues or his job.*

*Please notify him that this is NOT his email address and perhaps buy him some classes where they teach him how to use email and how email addresses work.*

*Thank you

*PS. My wife said she would accept free stuff from Neiman Marcus or Tiffany's in compensation for the headache this has caused us.*

All was quiet for a couple of weeks. Then today I got an email from AT&amp;T regarding an order the OTHER Michael Rodman in Chicago made. Yes

They can't find the account. I gave them that number (above) and the tracking numbers from the email THEY sent me (1ZA2024X0222974554 AND 1ZA2024X0222974554). They still can't find the account or the order.

In my attempt to contact ATT, ""Did I get disconnected again?"" She actually replied, ""Yes."" But I heard her, so I know she's a liar now. I had her on speaker and my wife agrees she couldn't have been joking. Should I trust that the case id (cm20130121_58516799) she opened for me is real?

-Smile and make eye contact with your waiter. We appreciate it. Seriously.

-Don't make a complicated order on drinks or food.

-Order a bottle of wine as opposed to a glass. This allows you to drink at your own pace.

-Don't order everything at one time. It WILL NOT make your meal come out any faster.

-BE PATIENT. Your favorite place will have a kitchen that will be overloaded with tickets. Food will take longer than usual to arrive.

-If you're unsure of a price

-Once you've finished eating and have paid

1370057764.0,1fg3d8,"In high school, my best girl friend, who I was in love with, sent me this in an email, at the time I thought it was cute. Years later,epring,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/1fg3d8/in_high_school_my_best_girl_friend_who_i_was_in/, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs
This is for the guys who escort their drunk, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, misled

This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego

The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, finding the ones that are single.

So, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, for all the situations where you are the faceless, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society,

**My self-summary**

I am an intelligent, green-voting, brony Redditor. I am looking for a girl that is smart, attractive, loyal, a little bit clingy, a classy dresser, which is my favourite TV show.
What I’m doing with my life
I am currently an aspiring indie game developer
I am currently saving my allowance for a trenchcoat and also a trip to my favourite country Japan.
I’m really good at
Video games, playing bass
The first things people usually notice about me
The classy way in which I dress. Seriously
People also notice my dry wit
Favorite books, music, and food
Shows: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic
Movies: Blade, Donnie Darko
Books: Harry Potter, Nietzsche (anything intelligent or about philosophy)
Music: My Chemical Romance, Alexis on Fire, Suicide Silence, Bring Me The Horizon
Food: Mountain Dew Code Red, Moms Home Cooking
The six things I could never do without
1. My Fedora
2. Japanese culture
3. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
4. I would have added Bioware's space epic ""Mass Effect""
5. My mom
6. Women...obviously
I spend a lot of time thinking about
My Little Pony, the ending to Mass Effect, girls (obviously), new jokes, Reddit xD
On a typical Friday night I am
Working hard on my game instead of wasting time and money going out like the millions of 18 year old sheeple in Chicago.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit
I'm a virgin and have had plenty of chances to lose it I'm just waiting for the right woman for me (see below)
I’m looking for

    Bi girls only
    Ages 18–40
    Located anywhere
    Who are single
    For long-term dating

You should message me if
you're a petite (fake boobs are disgusting), attractive, intelligent, slightly needy, loyal (I hate sluts) and funny.

You also MUST be a virgin (as I said above I HATE sluts)
