Well okay

I'm a graphic designer looking to get into more illustration work so as a side project I've been producing colouring pages of my favourite race cars and other vehicles that have caught my eye. It's early days and there are only a few to choose from at the moment

They take me quite a while to produce

It would be great if you could give it a look and see if you've got any thoughts. It's meant to be kid friendly / appealing and hopefully it'll introduce a few young minds to the exciting world of motorsport. Or at least keep them busy over the holidays until the big day arrives...

Any thoughts or requests for future images

[Radio Le Mans](http://www.radiolemans.com/) will be covering most of everything

Live timing and free live stream will be available [here](http://www.24h-rennen.de/en/live/). I think they'll broadcast the qualifying sessions as well as the race.

**Live Streaming SpeedTV Broadcasts:**

* **From Now-The End** (Live SpeedTV stream):
* *backup feeds:* Only use these if the JTV link above this stops working. These are lower quality streams
* Ustream Backup 1 No idea where the announcers are from:
* Vipbox backup stream (has tons of popups and nasty ad-ware crap:
That should be enough redundancy to make sure you don't mis a second of the race.

**Radio:**

* Radio Lemans is my personal favorite

* MRN will also be covering the race: [Click Here](http://motorracingnetwork.com)

If I missed anything feel free to let me know and I'll update this post.

*Update 1:* 10PM EST I've added Motors TV Live which is a European (if I'm not mistaken) feed. I'm going to see if I can find a better SpeedTV stream for tomorrow

*Update 2:* 10:30PM EST I took down the link to the pop-up hell/POS website and put the Justin TV link there. We'll see if it sticks around until tomorrow without a takedown. Coverage will be switching to Speedtv.com (linked above) in 30 minutes

*Update 3:* 11PM EST We're on to Speedtv.com streaming folks. Camera's will most likely be going static shortly until 9am tomorrow. Radio Lemans and MRN are both going to be announcing through the night. MRN is announcing on the Speed feed, so that's good news! If anybody is interested I'll be hanging in the Speedtv.com chat room (same username as here) on and off tonight.

*Update 4:* 11:20PM EST Speedtv.com's main site is down

*Update 5:* 11:40PM EST SpeedTV feed is up

*Update 6:* 6AM EST Good morning race fans! All streams are working with no-issues

*Update 7:* 7:31AM EST They're under a fog caution right now, and here's the 6:15am video update I had promised to post: [Click Here](http://bcove.me/dfyhz4q0)

*Update 8:* 9AM EST The Speedtv.com feed is turning off. Go to the Justin TV link above

*Update 9:* 9:20AM EST We're green! The SpeedTV Feed on JTV is working great. Let me know if you have any issues

*Update 10:* 12PM EST Added backup feeds, Definitly for the F1 races this season and a strong possibility for the 24 hours of Le Mans, Grand-am races and ALMS races (except for the 12 hours of Sebring because I'll actually be at that race.)",,False,self,t5_2qjt1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/motorsports/comments/17cewj/cant_watch_speedtv_coverage_of_the_24_hours_at/

That era in motorsports was and will be something unique. Everything was spectacular; from the cars that raced
Everything was so... informal

Just hearing the names of Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz and Auto-Union among others makes me feel nostalgic even though I didn't have the privilege to watch them race with my own eyes. The speed, THE NOISE and the looks of those machines amaze me. The mechanical and technological battle that took place in those years is truly spectacular. Just to mention; the power of the early 1930's cars wasn't matched until the turbocharged F1 cars of the 1980's.

I could go on writing about the circuits in which it was raced or the magnificent drivers and heroes like Tazio Nuvolari that feared nothing; but that would take too much time and I just wanted to make a point on why I want documentaries about this piece of motorsports history. If anyone knows any

I've recently watched ""Supercharged - The Grand Prix Car 1924 - 1939"" which I really liked and one of the BBC called ""Grand Prix

1346858470.0,ze9yf,ALMS/ Grand- AM Discussion &amp; Reaction thread.,Nickdaman31,15,5,25,"Well now that the press conference is over

1. Technical combinations - It was obvious that they had no clue what the buy out would do the the car classes. Dr. Panoz stated he wanted to keep car legal for Le Mans 24 in France so we may see a lot of integration of the FIA classifications into this new series. If I were to do it

2. Events - They mentioned a 12 event series with the possibility of dropping one event to allow teams to compete in the 24 of Lemans. I like this idea a whole hell of a lot. It is important for North American teams to compete in Europe to help show unity across the Sports car racing front. I know the North American fans don't want to have our series become an FIA series but we do need to be compatible if we are going to succeed. If we exclude ourselves our European/Asian teams we are in a whole mess of trouble. Also the amount of fans is now much larger. Events should bring much larger audiences and have much better television rights. This is only a plus for all of us. 

3. Buying of assets - With this deal, SCCA, Chin Motorsports, and Porsche Club of America. 

Those are the 3 big things I see with this new deal. I am wildly optimistic about the potential of this series but I still have doubts. I am happy to become both a Grand - Am and ALMS fan and support teams from both series. All of these are just my thoughts. I am not a reporter or an expert in the field. Just an avid fan of sports car racing. 

Let me know what you think or if you agree or disagree. If I am wrong about anything please let me know. I don't want to spread any false info. I want this to be a mature discussion so no flame wars.

We pause at this time of the year to reflect on the past season

With our seasons concluded

IndyCar bolstered its on-track product with a new chassis, a new race director. Eight winners emerged from five teams, an American series champion was crowned in the waning moments of the season and Lights champ Tristan Vautier ascended another rung from his ’11 Star Mazda Championship. 

The American Le Mans Series experienced another great season of multi-class Prototype and GT racing and now looks forward to a 2014 merger with GRAND-AM Road Racing to create the long sought after series that will blend the best assets of each organization. The IMSA development program expanded its Canadian GT Series and crowned two young stars of the future (please remember the names Tristan Nunez and Sean Johnston!) 

And of course, intrigue, drama and uncertainty. Not different from life itself, and perhaps why we are all here. If outcomes were assured, it wouldn’t be racing.

What is very certain to us is the commitment, time or place. We appreciate the sacrifices you have all made in your personal lives to make room for our events. We applaud your steadfastness as you endure the challenges created by the elements, the weekend schedules and the competition itself. We value your ideas and suggestions on ways to make Marshaling and service to our competitors safer and more efficient. 

Please also consider this a standing invitation to join us again in 2013

From everyone in IMSA and IndyCar Race Control

I have been a fan of various forms of motorsports throughout the years, off road and on road motorcycles, sports cars, ect.) I like drifting...it takes skill and it is fun to both do and watch, however when there are races that include this aspect, I have a hard time believing that it is faster than the conventional way. I do understand that there are competitions that judge on drifting, but I am talking about the racing itself. Am I wrong
