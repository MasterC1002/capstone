1362218598.0,19imfl,I want to vomit I am so sickened by the destruction of Couchsurfing.,mycouchgentlyweeps,85,18,54,"Couchsurfing was a great part of my life for several years, talk long into the night, uncalculated and without cynicism. 

I understand the old site was unwieldy and needed improvement.   But I can't see how any of the recent changes could facilitate more positive experiences for any host or surfer.   Couchsurfing is being destroyed in the promise of one day being rebuilt.

The city groups have been replaced by low-content place pages

The main way surfers find a couch seems to now be the Open Couch Request system

There is no longer any way to inform new members what the site should be about, the community guidelines, the New Members Welcome Group.  

The Couchsurfing userbase includes software professionals, travel industry experts, and others who have given detailed and well-intentioned feedback on how to improve the site or at least halt its destruction.  The response from Couchsurfing is to ignore them, delete their posts, then ban them. They've also taken down the Zendesk support forums and closed the Ambassadors (Public) group.   

I can't understand why the Couchsurfing management is choosing to destroy the site.   Is it simply ineptitude?   Here's what their employees think:  http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CouchSurfing-Reviews-E568573.htm

CS management likely see the current dissatisfied members as having reached the end of their 'customer life cycle',000 deeply committed members and still have a valuable site.   

Perhaps they are right.   Couchsurfing has certainly long since reached critical mass

I asked her about this, typing on her iPad. I pretended it was okay, but it was kinda unsettling.

He showed up with no car, no food, no money, and no means to acquire any of those things (no job or desire to work).  His only conversation was ranting about how unfair the world is (e.g. his parents).  He smelled horrible, he asked us to stop at a gas station (of course we were his taxi) where he spent the money on beer.  *“Thanks

Next, on Tuesday.*""  Yikes, well, okay.  Confirm her request, then, another email.  ""*Can you also give me a ride to a place 150 miles away, after I stay the night? We'll need to leave at 6AM*""  No, and we both have jobs.  *""I'll pray for your car and it will not fail. Please!""*  Again, maybe something is lost in translation here, these people are giving me a ride because you said no

Number four did similar

When she does see me

Turns out, it's even in her hair.  Dinner time.  *”Let me cook, I'm a gourmet chef.”* Proceeds to destroy our kitchen.  Cooks packaged food, uses every dish and utensil for a one skillet meal.  Every surface in the kitchen is filthy, not counting the bird shit.  Eats dinner with the bird, lets it eat chewed food out of her mouth, lovely sight for the rest of us. Bird shit on the table, shit on the couch, it's cold""*  It's July, it's all we have left.  Bird shit all over it

Next day, rugs, and tile now have mud *and* bird shit on them.  We don't wear shoes in the house, it's obvious to all but her.  The bird squawks all day, LOUD, wakes us up minutes after she leaves.  Shits everywhere in the spare room, attacks if I open the door.  At least the cats are entertained.  She returns last night at 10, we are clearly not happy, it should have been clear to you that he was coming in.”* Tries to play the he said / she said game with me and my SO, but okay

Also, were quickly taken away without a better alternative to replace them; the Zendesk forum where thousands of public posts featuring helpful suggestions re: recent site updates are now hidden from the public; and the memberships of two proactive and outspoken Ambassadors -- myself, Justin Holt (Chicago), and Don Shine (Berlin) -- were terminated without warning, and with no justification offered ""due to matters of privacy"".


Sam Houston, membership terminations); continue to burden us with a feature that disbanded our communities and made the site less safe and more difficult to navigate (i.e. Place pages); and still refuse to engage us in a courteous and professional manner.


If you or I were hired for **ANY** paid position and after 90 days still showed absolutely zero competence to fulfill the most basic duties of said position


We've caused quite a stir so far, a few choice comments in recent articles and tweets to news sources can make a helluva difference. Who knows? If enough people raise a fuss, maybe can reclaim some semblance of the CouchSurfing that we used to know -- at least for a bit longer.

Crash had traveled the country multiple times and was a Rainbow Gathering attendee and made an income from intricate hemp necklaces

He is, had a good time. Then he left and we both left our respective positive referrals and that was that.

Fast forward a year (present)

My coworker works as a door to door window salesman and one of his coworkers within basic carpool small talk told him he had a friend that had been shot and killed. His coworker said his name was Crash. And my roommate

Well

Crash apparently had a warrant out for his arrest in the city we live in and had gotten caught by the police for something basic (drinking in public, and Crash thought it would be a good idea to steal it and drive off. Crash did in fact steal the car, then drove a couple hundred feet and tried to run over the cop (maybe leaving Dunkin Donuts). The cop, like any armed person would, drew his gun and fired striking Crash in the chest with a fatal shot.

I have been hosting for a few weeks now and have taken in a few  surfers so far. The first one I took in was a woman that was absolutely stunning. Beauty, the whole shebang. Over the course of hosting her, I admit... I began to fall for her. To complicate things, she had a boyfriend back home. As a respectful host, I chose not to overstep the boundaries of being a solid host and didn't make a move. All the while we would go out and do stuff all the time, while in everyone else's eyes, we were a couple. It felt great.

Eventually her time with me ran out and she skipped town. It has been a few weeks since I last seen her and I catch myself thinking about her from time to time. A strange sadness creeps up on me. The feeling like when a good friend moves away. I do enjoy hosting. In fact it is amazing.

- In the past, well, it was irrelevant. Many added me to Facebook eventually and might have figured out I was dating a guy (though it's not obvious on Facebook, we just have a lot of random pics my guy and I) and I have never had a problem with it.

When I was at the last meeting a guy was pretty intent on getting my phone number and some other guys were flirting with me. I was really confused by what was happening, but I'm starting to think CS must also be a pretty effective dating/hookup tool for some people.

",3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/j5lil/had_a_fucked_up_guest_lucky_to_be_alive/,"Here's the story : I've hosted lots of people at my place, with great passion, and have had amazing times and made amazing friends in some of the people who stayed with me. Sure, but the really awesome ones totally made up for that. 

So, and I live in Porto, so i suggested we go together in my car as I also wanted to go and check it out (they had planned to drive there in a rental car). 

We correspond back and forth for weeks before they get here. They are doing a trip of all of Portugal and ending in Porto. So the communication goes fine

First, because ""it was easier"". One of them barely speaks english, and the other is a total bitch, but in hiding. What i mean by that is that she's constantly smiling, but it's extremely fake. 
So, I have a plan for my CS's, and everyone I've hosted (over 80 people) have loved it. They refuse, and want to walk around the city alone instead. I drop them off in the centre at around 11 am (and they are already complaining that it's late and they dont have time), and they call me back at 21 asking to be taken home. Everyday, they want to sleep before 23!

I am a great chef, which was cheap supermarket canned stuff... On my birthday, she stresses me from early morning and is generally a total bitch. We have a huge discussion in the supermarket because I want to make them some seafood dishes, and they would rather go to Vigo and spend 15 € on a restaurant there, because ""they know they would like that"". My seafood dishes usually cost 2 euros per person if we buy ingredients in the store, and nobody in their right mind would refuse a great seafood dish for 2€, am I right?

Also, and cook them anything they would like, as long as they pay for gas and they food. Everybody thinks this is a great deal, but she kept arguing about this, and didn't want to fork up gas money to Vigo at first, expecting me to drive them there for free... When we went to the supermarket buying stuff for them to eat, right before we are about to pay, I'll be right back"".. a minute later i see her on the other side of the check out counters

Now, and i wanted to help them, as they were short on cash. But she was disrespectful, rude, controlling and stubborn, bitch, uncooperative, to learn about it
What kind of makes this worse is that we communicated for a long time before they came

The worst part is that on the last day, almost right next to an open flame!!!** How my apartment didn't blow up and kill us all , I have no idea... I once had the gas on for 20 seconds because I couldnt find the lighter to light it, and when I finally did, the fire scorched my forearm and shaved 30cm of hair off, almost all the way to the elbow... 20 seconds, so I can just imagine what 30 minutes would have done. 

Anyway, but I've lost all passion and motivation for CS. I used to host 10-20 people per month, and I'm currently 1½ months without anyone here... 

Anyone ever experience similar situations? And what did you do?

**TL;DR :  I used to host lots of people who all loved it

I though about linking to my CS page, I'll add a link. I don't care about personal information, my username is my real one anyway, and the one I use on CS too...

As the title suggests

^((I'm new to this sub

I'll give the condensed-but-still-kind-of-long version of things

So, but *with* heaps of student loan debt. I returned to my hometown and ended up working at the same retail establishment that I left to go to college in the first place. I stayed there for just under two years just trying to get ahead until the company went through a reorganization, eliminated my position and laid me off. So now, I've got nothing but time on my hands until I take the next big step in my life. I never got to travel very much; so now that I have the opportunity, I plan to take a roughly 2 month journey via megabus, greyhound and flying (when I have to) in order to explore this crazy country of ours. 

So, before I started sending a ton of random people requests for a couch to sleep on - I thought, ""Why not reach out to people that I know I at least have *something* in common with first?"" Makes sense, right? 

If you're still reading this, however I mostly listen to hardcore, punk rock and hip hop. I'm super laid back, and usually really sarcastic. I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker. I enjoy having discussions with people on pretty much anything and love learning new things. I'm into computers and gaming in general (from SNES to Starcraft to COD), although not nearly as much as I'd like to be.  On the other hand, I'm also really into outdoor activities. I bought myself a cross bicycle and take it as many places as the weather permits me to. I'm a bit of a neat freak, so I make a pretty good guest if I may say so myself.

Ideally, I'm looking for people that are in, or very close to one of the cities I've listed, as I'll be traveling by bus and plane and won't be able to get very far unless there's public transportation to take me there. I don't care if you're male, female, a couple or a family. However, I'd prefer a home without small children (My tattoos and beard tend to scare them, as long as they're not humping me while I sleep or something. An extra bedroom, I bake, if you're just offering a place to stay and nothing more; that's fine


**TL;DR - Got laid off and want to travel, etc. Filling in the gaps with couchsurfing.org. It'll be a good time, and totally worth it in the end for both of us!**


I really just want to travel and experience new things and people. So if you think you can help me out, numbers, whatever makes you feel comfortable and/or like I'm not going to steal your valuables or end up being absolutely bat shit crazy. 

So what do you say? [Help a fellow redditor out?](http://i.imgur.com/u6ftD.jpg) Maybe just upvote this post for exposure? I'd really appreciate it!

So after all the time I spent with them, and I felt like I wouldn't be able to find any locals like them in my new country. My husband, who is also a couchsurfer, tried to help me build a new kind of CS meeting. We planned the idea for a long time before doing anything (the fancy couchsurfers were monopolizing the group of the city, so we were afraid that they might delete our posts) and we started slowly to go out to the same old pub with couchsurfers visiting our town. We would try to get as much people as possible, and then I would write a really vague message on the group, and we would send private messages to those who were interested. It was the beginning of something!

It went like that for 2 months, and more tacos). Right now, we are excited for our meeting next week, we are supposed to be 4 or 5 !!

* Send personalized messages to your host describing yourself
* Have a backup plan

For those of you that don't know how we work, van, tree house, and so on, you can rent it out to couch surfers or people traveling through the area and show them around town for a small profit. Hosts make maybe 40 bucks a night if they want, and travelers get to stay with some cool people and find out about decent places to go in the city without paying a bunch for hotels.

I’ve had an account for about 18 months and am keen to join in, travelers to this area are few and far between (about 3 in 2012, and 2 ended up going elsewhere instead)), so the only time I can really get involved is when I’m travelling and, as yet, I’ve never been able to find a host. Since I know Amsterdam will be a busy city, I’m wondering if I’d stand a better chance by contacting people sooner

For info, so normally like to get away for a couple of days when work’s not as busy, or over the weekend. Up until now, I’ve only been sending requests to other female surfers around the same age and/ or who seem similar in personality. My profile is complete, has photos and is regularly updated. I spend a lot of time on my couch requests, and always make sure they’re personalized, with several references to the host’s profile and why I think we’d get on, from a friend

Money is not really an issue for me, but I’d like to get to know some locals, too. Can anyone give me any tips on how to increase my chances?

I just created my account today. I have roughly $600 dollars and 3 months and I have no ultimate destination in mind although there are specific places I would like to experience in the United States

I have a motorcycle and I plan on packing lightly. I have friends in the Bay Area, but otherwise I want to somehow maybe zig zag my way down to Texas. However, I'm not too set on any particular route and I've never seen the East Coast either, although I hear it's hot right now.

I also wouldn't mind finding people who need rides here or there and maybe I could craigslist rideshare for a tank of gas

I just graduated from college and I can work odd jobs here and there for cash. Also

My first question is

I plan on leaving in about two weeks and maybe heading to Montana, so I don't scare anyone off with body odors. But do people normally allow you to use their shower and laundry machines? If so I wouldn't need more than a few days worth of clothing because there are thrift stores in nearly every state, I imagine, if I absolutely needed to get something else.

I'm backpacking around Europe for three months this fall and right now I'm in London. So far I've been staying in hostels and even though it's only been about a week I can tell that if I continue on this way my trip is going to be a succession of one tourist trap after another. This is definitely not what I'm looking for! Everyone I've met that has couchsurfed loved it so I think it would be good to give it a try.

So I have two questions. 
*First and most importantly:* if you live somewhere in England in a more rural area or really anywhere that isn't a huge city
*Second:* do you have any advice for choosing towns to stay in

This is all kind of last minute. I was going to stay in one place and work at a hostel but ended up deciding against it because I wanted to see more different places. Now I need to figure out the best way to actually do that.
I would love to travel around to random little towns wherever I can find hosts. Right now I want to continue exploring England but then I hope to go up to Scotland, and then work my way east along the north and back around to Spain via southern countries. I know that's pretty ambitious but it's just my vague directions for now. So if you're anywhere along there feel free to hit me up!

Then, because he had an emergency. I understand emergencies, but this left me in a very awkward situation, with most hostels booked and no other place to go. He said he'd be out of Pisa for three days. I ran into him the NEXT day at a cafe.

As far as I know, which insulted me a lot. He said it was because we didn't spend a lot of time together, but what am I supposed to do if he wants to stay in the house and I want to explore? Sit around waiting?

I'm a 21 year old male that has been in beautiful Vancouver for just over a month now! I have a part time job as an outdoor education instructor for kids and am loving it! I've only been involved with couchsurfing for around 3 months but have had awesome experiences so far with it!

At this stage

I'm hoping to find a host that will let me stay slightly longer term than usual - I'm hoping for anywhere between two weeks to a couple of months. I'm super handy around the house and would love to help out with cleaning and anything else in exchange for a couch or spot on the floor! If you have a room or bed spare I would love to contribute whatever I can afford weekly to pay for my stay

I am very clean
A small list of things I could help with :

- Cleaning
- Other housework
- Gardenening and landscaping
- Painting
- Basic computers
- Personal training / take you for a workout
- Nutritional advice
- Help with english
- Help with exercise science / kinesiology study
- Teach you how to slackline / rock climb / basics of hiking
- Hold a decent conversation with you 
- many many more random

Closer to downtown is  preferred but I am interested in anybody that is willing to help out :) I'm hoping to either couchsurf for a couple of months while I finish my work in Vancouver

I am very new to this but am traveling around the 48 states soon.

I will arrive in Seattle with a good friend on Feb 1st 2012. We currently have no plan whatsoever

We will be traveling the states by car and would love it if other surfers throughout the 48 would show us around your state/town. We're not looking to be hosted as we can stay in hotels

Anyhow

My girlfriend didn't tell him to leave that day

He left on Wednesday before I got home, which made her feel even worse...and in turn, made me feel like a horrible person. I also feel bad that I didn't tell him to his face that I was uncomfortable, but I don't know him well and he's not my friend yet.

- Do you have any tips on finding my first adress? As stated

- I am male

- I will travel alone

- My budget is roughly 6000 €

- I am very easygoing and laid back.

* How far in advance should I contact people? When I travel I have rough ideas for an itinerary and may spend longer (or shorter) amounts of time in a particular area. I'd hate to inconvenience someone by saying I will be in their city on Monday .. but then decide I won't get there until Wednesday. How would I balance being considerate to being more free with my plans.

* As a surfer do you give your hosts any sort of gifts? I will be backpacking so I don't want to pack around a lot of stuff.

* When planning for a stay in a particular area do you contact several people? To me it might seem rude to decide on one place and then tell the others .. sorry I found somewhere else.

&gt;Hey r/albuquerque
&gt;
&gt;A very successful Ohio based film company is shooting their new production in ABQ and I have been offered an unpaid position with them in their production offices. This is an opportunity for me to gain professional experience in the industry I want to work in as well as network with like minded individuals. I'm really excited about this and want to pursue it
&gt;
&gt;So, I'm just trying not to spend $100 a night at a hotel as I definitely do not have that kind of money and I'm also not trying to sleep in my car for a month.
&gt;
&gt;As far as who I am, then I can be pretty out-going. But from my discussions with the producer it sounds like I will be working a lot of hours in the offices so you would probably barely know I'm there. I'm essentially just looking for a bed or a couch or a floor where I could place some pillows and a blanket for a few days and maybe a shower that I could use a few times.
&gt;
&gt;Please message me if you have any way to help or know anyone who could

Guys and girls--I'm trying to get to GDC, but it seems like my host is getting cold feet.  

This conference is kind of a big deal for me. I might not have another chance to network like this again

Ideally I'd need a parking spot, and place to set up my computer so that I can write up the conference in something resembling real time.  At minimum, I could settle with just having access to a shower and an iron, so I can look professional.  I'll bring my own soap and what not.  

I **just** moved to Sacramento from Detroit, but I'm an okay guitar player, and I'd be willing to sing for my metaphorical supper.  I'd even cook and clean your house a bit, if you want.

I'll bring my own food (canned soup, (SFW?). even though I won't be partaking, since I'm trying to find a job and need to pass a drug test.

1336153012.0,t74ud,"A letter from former ""CEO"" of CS Dan Hoffer",merkozy2012,1,1,2,"""Dear CouchSurfers

This past year at CouchSurfing has been a unique one in our history. We've changed our legal structure. We shrank our team significantly (previously at 44 including part-time), adopting more internal structure and accountability than we've ever had. And we're going to continue hiring experienced people at all levels of the organization, from the top to the bottom. But throughout all the changes, it has always been important to me to preserve the original CouchSurfing spirit, values, vision, and mission. After all

As President of CouchSurfing International, we need to make it easier for surfers and hosts to connect with one another. The ability to post travel plans, which gives hosts more ability to select when and who to host, was one of our first steps to address this issue. We've also just begun taking member suggestions on other ways to work on this problem.

Second, then we will lose some of our magic. So it's important to grow with the right people and in the right ways.

And finally, improve the speed and reliability of the website, enhance our user interface and usability, and more. There is no shortage of things to do, and it takes time to build everything we want to build, even with our newly expanded team. But we're working hard and making progress every day!

I know that there has been a lot of change lately, and expanding your horizons wherever you go. It's about making the world a better place. I think we're closer than we've ever been to that goal.

Happy surfing and big hugs from California

Dan Hoffer""

If I wouldn't loathe the ignorant sheep-like mob so much I would probably mind the ongoing phony manipulation of them.

""outspoken"" :-D That's of course nonsense and nothing but their twist on what really is nothing more than repeating and summarizing all the retarded nonsense by the usual bunch of idiots who obviously drew all their pathetic self-esteem from acting like the benevolent enlighteners of the people only trying to open these common simpletons' eyes for all that's rotten in the state of CS - and then mixing that up with some actually valid points...)

What's so clever about this is
And then people still think ME to be an attention whore:-D

What I like best about that is that the guys in the CS organization fell for that tactic:-D
Beginning with those amateurs who take care of actual members' safety on CS (and that actually not THAT badly) PLUS all which falls under their ridiculously idiotic broader interpretation of the term ""members' safety"" (and that as pathetically as it inevitably has to be when this is really nothing but a highly arrogant patronizing of all other CS'ers under the phony pretense of caring about their safety) and from there all the way up to the CS boss who now pays the bill for giving the amateurs free reign.

My name is Eric and I am 27 years old. I just recently quit my corporate job (9-5 type deal) and am starting a journey around the world for a few months with a buddy of mine, tell you about our travel plans, and even interview you for a movie/documentary we're trying to film (we're complete amateurs) about how different people across the world live and how they define a successful and meaningful life. 

We're desperate..we've been sending requests on CS for a while and to no avail. Hopefully one of y'all can come to the rescue.

I'm a German guy living in the Netherlands.

-_- I am confuse. 

Anyways, but does anybody have space for us? I promise I am not a creepy weirdo and neither are my friends. (Yeah, yeah yeah that's what they all say ಠ_ಠ)

But seriously! We're all 23-24 years old, GA, our mutual friend told me she was going to NY and then asked if I wanted to go, since I've never been I was all, ""check yes, motherchecker"" and booked a flight up out this bitch, like a boss. 

HOWEVER, i actually thought 'lol') BOY WAS I WRONG. So I looked around all over the place on every website I could find, tripadvisor, booking, bookit, expedia, the whole fucking internet. Nothing in the ballpark range that I want to spend, can't do it

So

If you can help me out with a surf let me know ill link u my profile. Also if you can let me know of some cool stuff too do in New York this weekend that's relatively cheap.

1362891031.0,1a0cxm,Vote on how I should destroy my couch. ,Citizenbushido,8,11,8,"Since CSHQ has been doing such a good job destroying the couchsurfing that I know and love. I've decided that I want to destroy my couch. I've been staying up at night thinking about how CS is being ruined and it makes me so mad. The last 3 nights I didnt get to sleep until 6am thinking about all the crap thats going on. 

I cant stop thinking that I'm utterly powerless to take a stand....Well not any more

How should I destroy my couch? 

1. Blow it up with gunpowder
2. Burn it with lots of gas
3. Drop it off a building. ""i have a 5 story building I think I can drop it off of"" 
4. I can shoot it with guns
5. I can try to blow it up with tannerite
6. My father in-law owns a junkyard. We can try to destroy it with old car airbags.
7. I can take it to an Amish saw mill and have them use there big sawmill saws to cut it up. 
8. I could just beat the shit out of it with a machete
9. I'm open to suggestions.

*update*  I was playing around with the gunpowder last night and TIL that gunpowder does not explode it fizzles...I'm not going to try to put it under pressure as i like my hands,False,self,t5_2qs85,1362926192.0,,,t3_1a0cxm
