Despite that, well-rounded person. Even though I don't play StarCraft anymore (no means to, as soon as I have them I will) I thank Day9 every day for this. Finding his videos a few years back when I was at my worst probably not only saved my life but allowed me to enjoy it. His attitude rubbed off on me. I wanted to be that happy. My goal in life became ""be 1/10 as awesome as Day9."" Anyway, I e-mailed him about all this, despite some misgivings telling me ""it's 5am! You're making a bad decision! You'll seem creepy!"" I'm so glad I did. 

He actually responded very promptly. This was actually about a year ago, and how much he cared for a random fan...he is one of the heroes that isn't disappointing when you finally get to contact them. I hope it helps someone else out there. I think he gives great advice that can help anyone at any stage in their life. It seems obvious, but he made me actually listen.

Anyway, if any chance you ever read this, thank you so so much for helping me through my terrible high school years, when I had no freedom to leave the bad situation I was in. I'm so much better now and a lot of it is thanks to you. Here was his response: 

Hey -name taken out for obvious reasons-:

Not creepy at all!

What an incredible

We read your email to Day and all talked for a while about how hard it is to grow up.  I mean really hard.  We've all struggled

Day says to tell you that he totally relates.  Personally, funny people.  He asks you to remember to play.  A lot.  And laugh.  A lot.  And not to take life too seriously.  It is all gonna be great.  Just hang in there.  Good times directly ahead.  He promises.

He has to go on State of the Game now so he can't say more, you will know it is your fault.  ;p

And keep watching the Daily!  It is audience like you that make the hard work worthwhile!

 Watching the archive of Daily's is the only thing that has gotten me through the events of this last year: my slip back into depression, to a drop out having to repeat a year. 


For much of the past year the only reason I could find to get out of bed would be to check the archive, to begin with I didn't even enjoy playing Starcraft 2 online and yet watching the Daily and listening to Day[9]'s commentary was one of the only things that brought me any joy and allowed me to relax. 

Whilst watching the Daily, for the first time in months. Whether It was laughing at one of the stories about Felicity or at his Mutalisk impressions. 

 I can honestly say that if I had not found the Daily, Day[9], through the Daily, never failed to make me laugh and feel just a little bit happier. 

I don't think I can ever really put into words how grateful I am that I found the Daily and that Day[9] does the daily. 

Thank you Sean

1344480380.0,xx2ym,Help Day9 with his computer troubles [from a computer tech's perspective].  ,,175,22,46,"Day9: I've seen that you have had a ton of problems with your computer.  I'd like to help you

Currently

* 1) The kernel failure is probably from your graphics card(s) overheating.  You already did the basic troubleshooting

* 2) The general performance issues you have regularly faced for years should be fixed by implementing several identical high performance SSD hard drives in a RAID 10 [or try a RAID 0+1] configuration [the number of drives to be left up to your pocketbook

**Fellow reddit trollers! Please upvote this [it is a self-post so I don't care about karma... I mean... who actually cares about karma anyway...] to increase the chances of Day9 actually seeing this.  He has been having tons of trouble... and I only want to help him out.**  

Solutions (keep in mind I know nothing about your computer - you'll have to custom tailor this for your particular build): 

* 1) The solution to this problem really depends on how much $[J] you're willing to spend.  You could troubleshoot the issue by checking your video card software to see if it has a temperature readout - if it does not

If your graphics card is getting close to 90 c, [this guy shows a pretty nice liquid kit](http://youtu.be/gdaGDH-or-Q?t=33s).  I have done a few liquid cooling set ups and they can be cheap (less than $300) but cooling is extremely important so you shouldn't cheap out on it.  

* 2) I've watched your live stream quite often.  I don't think the stuttering that we see most often has to do with your internet connection.  I think it has to do with the most likely bottleneck in a computer

I think if you implemented 4 high performance SSDs in a RAID 10 [or if you're feeling frisky, you would lose those stuttering problems.  

Update: Sean has [replaced his graphics card.](https://twitter.com/day9tv/status/233400776268054528) I have no doubt that will solve the problem in the short term - but I strongly recommend monitoring that new card's temperature as the overheating problem is probably systemic (you could have poor circulation inside the case).  

Good luck with the new graphics card!  I still strongly recommend implementing at least a 4 drive RAID 10!

**Update 2**: I wanted to point out to everyone who is bringing up the important issue of cost, that he keeps a backup of just about every part in the computer... Cost is obviously not the issue... This is common for this kind of user.  

Now if he would just read this and do some 4x SSDs in Raid 10 he'd lose that stuttering and install a liquid cooling kit to avoid a repeat of yesterday.  ",,t5_2rvng,1344565084.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/day9/comments/xx2ym/help_day9_with_his_computer_troubles_from_a/

The topic for this particular Funday Monday would be to submit games wherein you, in any type of game (1v1, 2v2, FFA, etc), but you must fulfill at LEAST two previous Funday Monday restrictions in the same game (for example, Building Queens at all times with Spine Crawler attacks). 


The challenge is to see who can come up with the most/craziest combinations of restrictions. This is our chance to REALLY show DayJ how creative we can be


I have actually created an [Excel spreadsheet](http://www.filesend.net/download.php?f=7cade116869999a448512ab3fa28856b) detailing all possible previous Funday Monday topics (up through episode 479, you couldn't do Monobattles and worst 2v2 partners of all time simultaneously.

Mr j

More than once you've inspired me to chase the things in life we think are out of reach. In interviews and junk like that

We met once at NASL and I have a picture to commemorate the joyous occasion. The line was a mile long but you were nice enough to hold a conversation with me where you asked ""are you gonna have kids?"" and I said ""I hope so!"" and you said ""make them play games."" Well what I didn't tell you is that I had one of the rarest diseases known to man. Instead of having kids I wrote a book, althouh i'm sure you get that a lot.

On November 26th 2011

We had so much fun and we submitted our replay

I was in front of the screen

And then

""Day9 chose our replay!!!"" I screamed so loud so everybody in here would hear me! Izzak

They all sat in the living room with me and watched the replay as you were commenting it.

I was shocked! I was smiling, and all I was hearing was you saying my name! Then, my sanity went back slowly and I promised myself I would become better so you would be proud of me!

I followed your advice and I played StarCraft2 after the daily (a few 4v4 with Izzak and two friends of mine)!

My friends suggested me to ask you if you would agree to play a 2v2 with me so you could teach me how to be a better gamer! :)

It would truly be an honor if you would agree playing with me! :D

Thanks again so much for the joy you brought to our house and to my heart tonight! &lt;3

- Dude
- Awesome! I already have the first one...

To make a long story short. The pebble started an avalanche and here are the results:

Introducing; The Day[9] Dating Game.




It is here to help all of you nerd ballers to get friskey with ze ladies. gl hf gg

The Day[9] Dating game 1.0

(thanks for all the inspiration Sean)

Ground rules:

* Never give up
* FOR UNIDEN
* The relationship between a boy and a girl will always
* A girl who sleeps around is a ”carrier”. Don't be a fool
* The art of finding a target is called scouting
* Don't ever become a stalker
* If she suspects that you are stalking her
* Think of any ladies dad as a reaper. He may seem fragile
* Refer to her sister as your natural expansion
* The speed upgrade is a plus when your targets boyfriend arrives
* The speed upgrade is a plus when you probe an allies natural
* A guy who brings his girlfriend to guys-night out has been subjected to neural parasite. Do your best to get the infestor to leave without getting your ally into trouble. Eliminate the infestor from the equation.


Things to do on a date:

* Everytime she takes a sip of water you must slurp your own drool
* Sneak Yoda into the conversation
* Refer to your home as ”the lost temple”
* In case your home is messy
* Claim that you can't pick up the whole bill because you're awesome at macro and you never have any money left over
* Mention your ex girlfriend Sarah Carrigan atleast once. This lets her know that youre not a total looser (right...)
* When you're full
* When discussing art
* Tell a heartfelt story about a cousin that was addicted to stim. Chicks dig a sensitive guy
* Tell her that you had a bejujular time

If things are going well

* Tell her that your dream car is a blue flame hellion
* Tell her that she's hotter than a blue flame hellion and that you'd love to ride with her
* Use the word Cattle Bruiser when you're talking about you penis

Closing the deal:

* ”Want to come over and see my xel'naga tower” is always a good pick up line to close the deal.
* The first act of sexual intimacy is called probing
* Don't ever rush to second base
* If her ramp is force fielded you have two choises. 1) just give it some time. 2) crush it with your colossus
* ”Lining them up” must be your facebook status after two or more concecutive wins at the dating game ladder
* Should we go back to my command centre or your nexus?
* When penetration finally occurs

If and when you're out of the dating game:

* A sign that you are in a comfortable relationship is when you start referring to taking a dump as doing a Thor drop
* Sing her the baneling song
* The immortal dance is the only dance you will perform at your wedding
* A womans womb is not a hatchery
* Always stay positive to beeing dumped like a boar

Avoid if possible:

* Don't spew your creep just because you see a girls nipple
* If you hug a girl
* Don't call all girls Felicity
* Trumpets

Kind regards

_As much as I can understand that people might need to have their Day[9] fix on many aspects of their lives


_First of all, please accept that he may do things on his own, that sometimes he may want to have some times for himself and that, it may imply that he won’t cast an event. Don’t get me wrong, I love when Day[9] casts and I would even say that it is the major reason for me to watch an event!


_However, like if Day[9] owes something to those who wrote them. Day[9] doesn’t owe anything to any of us. He does what he does because he loves it and because he feels like it. We and I all know that he loves e-Sports but if, for any kind of reasons, he would quit doing either his dailies or any sort of casts, no one would have a thing to say about that. No one would have that right. Moreover, no one would have the right to ask for a reason why he would do that.


_In the same way, because I know that he would feel pressure from that request. And that goes to all of you asking over and over again those sorts of things. Day[9] is too nice to say that he might feel pressure from those requests but take a minute and imagine yourself in his shoes. How would you feel in the same situation?


_One more thing… Stop asking for his salary. Please. Just stop. How much he earns from those ads or how much he makes for doing a cast in an event is none your business! At all! If he ever wanted you to know how he earns in a year

How did I get started with Starcraft?  How did I hear about Day9?  Christmas 2010

I played through the campaign, to start my adventure into ranked.  I'll have you know, I went straight into my ranked 1v1 placement matches, because practice league sounded boring, and I didn't need 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 to prove my worth.

My first game?  I was probably finishing up my barracks when a handful of reapers jumped over the wall into my base and started ripping apart my SCVs before I knew what to do with them.  I was freaking out.  My 30 APM to make workers and build a barracks was already too much for me, completely murdering me.  I'm pretty sure I cried a bit, I felt so awful.  The other guy kind of realized what was going on, and was really nice though, and apologized for doing such a cheesy build.  

I kept playing, I had a pretty rough loss again, and afterwards the other player suggested I check out some videos to get a better grasp on the game.  He recommended HD, Husky, and Day9.  I subscribed to all of them on youtube, and started watching and learning, and while HD and Husky are awesome, and Funday Mondays

Before getting too personal

Sean's level of fame hasn't changed who he is.  He is a regular person still like all of his viewers.  He gets it.  And his imperfections, the chat/ chat involvement really helps to create and foster a sense of community.  It's kind of like sitting there on a giant sofa with thousands of friends all watching along :3

I think a lot of people don't realize the mental level that Sean must have regarding the game.  Knowing the game is just as much part of his job as it is part of a current Pro's job.  Years being a competitor at Brood War helped him develop and understand the competitive mindset behind a game like that.  I will hear people complaining that he can't possibly know the game at the same level as a pro player

This culmination of Sean as a person, and a genuinely nice and awesome person.  Beyond all of that though, he doesn't treat his viewers as fans, but instead as friends.  He shares himself with his viewers, the very personal and private side of himself.  He reaches out in some ways to every corner of his viewership, may it be some obscure joke, or calling out people and taking the time to be say ""so-and-so is awesome"" before a daily.  He treats his viewers in a way that I could only treat a handful of people I am personally close to.  This, is why he is so popular in my opinion.

Now, and like many others suffering as well, suicide is always one of those very real things on your mind.  About a year or so ago, a good friend of mine's roommate killed himself.  A seemingly happy college kid, with a lot of things going for him, not too different from myself, now gone.  It's something that at the very least has left me thinking quite a lot.

As I stated, including my girlfriend, Felicity :P, who also has a lot of difficulties with depression, and I were our own little support group.  Things were looking great around this time, back in the spring of 2011 when I was playing a lot of Starcraft and had just gotten into Day9.  I was offered a job as an intern at Microsoft.  It was an amazing opportunity career-wise for me and I couldn't really turn it down.  It was going to be a long way away in Seattle, though

Sure enough, she came to the conclusion that we should break up after a long four and a half really solid years of dating. I was respectful and understanding about it, and we even still talk and see each other on occasion.  At that time, though, the mix of a stressful new job, being on the other side of the country, and the fact that this all happened right in time to be the worst 21st birthday present ever made it really rough on me.

The next day, but when that stuff happens and you've already had a pretty hard time dealing with depression, you need a distraction.  Day9 was that distraction.  I started watching live every day after work.  The AHGL at this time, and getting to see the Microsoft team play live was also really awesome.

I'd fall asleep listening to his dailies or different interview podcasts he had done.  And when I felt bad, I'll just put on one of my favorites.  I'll listen to the Valentine’s daily, or ""what natural expansion?"", because I never get tired of watching poor little Megumi stars try to fly :3  So many different gems and moments.  

But you know what really did it, just like me.  Recently, he gave his talk on relentless positivity and gave his analogy for emotions using kittens and ninja stars.  That struck a chord.  Yeah, that’s what’s going on.  I've taken a lot of ninja stars in a row, and it suuuucked.  But after getting hit so many times, you start to get a bit numb.  Either you can start being numb to the kittens, or you can take all of that and try to maybe stand in front of a few ninja stars for someone else (or you know

There is no limit to the different ways Sean has been there for me.  Not a celebrity, I have a great respect for him.  I've been a proud subscriber since around the time he started his subscription service.  I try to stay involved and play a positive role in the community.  I remember arguing with one of my friends about how weird it would be being famous and having all these fangirls swooning over you, so I figured it'd make a pretty funny and interesting question for his AMA. [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16PNOH48Ys&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1311s) [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jzzi0/iama_day9_lol_ill_be_doing_a_live_ama_tomorrow/c2ggl2p) .  And of course that was my favorite answer :3

Also

So, Day[9].  Thank you, Sean.  

Don't ever stop doing what you do.  You quite possibly saved my life.  It has been a rough journey

P.S.  Just watched Daily 403 (The COMPLETE FAILURE DAILY) and that's exactly what I’m talking about.  Just sitting back and talking to his fans.  Not powering through a struggling daily.  Being open with everyone :3

TL;DR  I’ve been through a bit of shit and I’ve struggled with depression

So the game starts, the chance to play with Sean gave me a huge boost, and i was rearing to go!

To those that watched the daily, i wasn't expecting my Graphics card to Burn out halfway through the match.

I panicked when the textures started swapping (my GPU had been fine all day) and when i couldn't see what was going on for about 3 minutes straight

I managed to sort it out temporarily

This isn't anything all that profound or life changing

I started watching the Daily pretty much when SC2 was released. I live in Australia, and I can't say that I watch every episode, but I do watch them every now and then, especially if there are ones that I think would be particularly beneficial. At the moment, I'm 17 and about to finish High School and over the past few months, I've been faced with the wonderful question of what I'm going to do when I'm done and as I'm sure most of you know, it's a pretty daunting task.

This year hasn't been all that great for me, and that has only been compounded by the stress of school and trying to work out what I want to do with my life. Over the past few months, I haven't really liked the person that I've become as I tried to find my own way of dealing with these things and I can't say that I've felt truly 'happy' in a while.

Also, but I haven't really found anything that I love and want to do when I finish school. I guess in the High School setting, it might be a little hard to be able to imagine all the possibilities but, nevertheless, I haven't really felt at ease with any decisions that I make, and I've always been worrying - 'Is this the best thing that I can be doing right now?' or 'What is the best use of my time? Am I being productive?' and things like that.

Yesterday, so I won't go into it) but the advice that he gave has really helped me to I guess kind of change my outlook on life at the moment. 

I've decided to start to make a list of the things that make me happy, so that I can be a positive aspect of their life and try to make them happy too.

Like I said, you're definitely one of the people who I look up to and I wish you the best of luck in all that you do both for the E Sports community and in your personal life. Thanks again Sean.

As you know


Well first of all


And I honestly don't think you'll ever really get to that point where you have practiced enough to be fully confident in doing so as your life is far too busy and structured where hours of practice per day likely won't happen unless you change things a lot.


In the mean time, it would be immensely beneficial to all of us who watch. I find Artosis' stream to be so helpful and you are by far the best at game analysis so I imagine it would be even better.


And if you streamed


But you know what? Fuck those people. There are thousands of us who won't care if you make mistakes


We realize you aren't currently grand masters. We realize that you don't get to sit down and play very often. 


WE WON'T JUDGE YOU!!!


And we will shun and flame those haters who will.


So please


We know you aren't a full time pro-gamer. We've been watching Artosis and he's been making a lot of mistakes. It's understandable that he would since he doesn't get to play much and we know the same would be true of you. But we will still learn so much and it would be so fun.

&gt; Dear Day9, would you consider moving or migrating in order to stay close to the action. (For instance to avoid time zone issues or travel times.) PS: You were wrong. Green is still the best.

8. From Pelinore:
&gt; Dear Day9, you spend quite some time considdering what you would do if your name was to be picked. Do you have a plan ready in case you had to compete, and if yes (if not improvise) what would you do to come out on top? &lt;3

So I'm a fan of the Day[9] Daily and watch it live and archived when I can. I also have a problem with sleeping. I usually don't fall asleep until around 3 or 4 am even though I got into bed at 12 or 1 am and I tend to have nightmares (really vivid ones, movies and white noise, but those don't really work, I just stay up and pay attention to them. I've tried tea before bed, but that just makes me need to use the restroom. I've even tried that mind trick where you make your muscles relax and imagine your happy place. Unfortunately, they don't work for me. One day, my boyfriend suggested watching #100 again before I went to bed, got into bed and turned it on. And actually fell asleep. I think I feel asleep about 20 minutes into it

 

I'm not saying you're boring though! I'm saying that watching 100 helped me calm down enough to fall asleep and not have horrific dreams where I watch my family get torn to shreds. So thank you



**TL;DR version**: Day[9]'s sexy voice soothes the soul and prevents night time monsters from getting you while you try to sleep.

-Brood War Special

The stands surrounded what was a giant open space.  Slightly confused by the different scenery we waited until everyone else filled in for the competition begin.  At some point day9 shows up, and all of a sudden he's wearing ice-skates.  Like huge, real deal ice-skates.  He enters the competitive area, and begins to glide effortlessly.  I look down and he is in fact ice-skating on water.  Not ice, water.  I'm genuinely impressed, but having never watched a starcraft 1 event, I take it for what it is and get excited about the competition.  Suddenly, and day9 is up.  He glides out onto the water, and water polo.  Of course he wins the competition

I feel that these episodes help me grow as a gamer and (as a bonus) are some of the most interesting to watch. 

It's not often we get to hear a professional SC2 player explain the exact choices in their build and, but learn all of the different scenarios that could occur and what to do in each scenario. As an added bonus we learn more about pro players and see them interact with one of the best analytical minds in the SC2 scene.

I can't describe how much I appreciate the combination of Pro Player + Specific Build + Sean's Questions + Multiple Games of that specific build all wrapped up into one 60-90 minute Daily.

If you agree PLEASE send an email to: feedback@day9.tv -- hopefully enough of you agree with me to bring this feature back to the Day9 Daily!

1330102836.0,q48pc,Funday Monday Brainstorm,Hiroic,41,8,22,"Here's a couple of ideas I had floating around

###Track and Attack (Terran only)
#Can only attack areas that are within the radius of a Sensor Tower.
The idea is to encourage innovation with an underused building
E.g. Do a tank contain with a tower and scan the high ground whenever enemy units are near.
 
###Behind Enemy Lines (All races)
#Before your first attack, retreat back to your base; where a new Ryan will be designated. 
The aim of this to encourage attacking with limited objectives.
E.g. Ryan could be a reaper hidden in the back of a zerg expansion
 
# 
###Triple Combo (All races)
#Must obey the rules from any three previous Funday Mondays (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Day9_Daily) and subtly inform your opponent at the beginning. I have no idea if this is viable!
E.g. Mass Queens (Ep 256)
 
# 
###Stack'em High (All races)
#Have to attack at least three times using 'stacked' units.
This can be done in the following ways:
# - Stack up workers on unbuilt refineries
# - Drop units in a constricted space
# - Nydus into a constricted place (can send drones through to make evolution chambers)
# - Use force fields to constrict units
# - Send units into a Vortex and then pylon wall off
# - Sequentially pick up units with Graviton Beam and then wall off
The main idea is to innovate new tactics
 
# 
###Look No Hands! (All races)
#All battles must be controlled using only hotkeys and by commands issued via the minimap.
The main aim is too encourage multitasking and to show that most actions can be performed by this method. Also teaches new tricks like minimap feedbacking and formation blinking.

# 
###Bullet Time (All races)
#Play a custom game on the slowest time setting.
It completely changes the nature of the game
 
# 
###Bait and Switch (Terran only)
#Only allowed one tech lab at a time.
The aim is to encourage innovation within limited constraints and switching buildings.
E.g. Do a cloak banshee opening into siege tank push.",,t5_2rvng,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/day9/comments/q48pc/funday_monday_brainstorm/

I listen to your daily all the time and I really dig the music you play during breaks. This NewbieTuesday you promoted Trentemøller and Blue Sky Black Death. I dug them so much that i am going to buy their stuff from their websites.

My request is, but more like a 'What day9 is digging right now' type of playlist. You dont even have to worry about keeping it updated....maybe just publish a new one every few months....
