You start by wrapping the barrel in tin foil.
Then you wrap bacon around it

http://imgur.com/Qzt4t.jpg

you then wrap some more tin foil around it

http://imgur.com/fuY3J.jpg


It is now ready to be inserted into the cooking device.
I ripped the tin foil a little bit getting the barrel inserted. that part of the bacon got severely burned by hot gasses.

http://imgur.com/q75AR.jpg


After just a few short bursts you should be able to smell the wonderful aroma of bacon.

http://imgur.com/H8fmZ.jpg


I gave this about 250 rounds. but I think around 150 might actually be enough. But then again I don't mind when bacon is crispy.
Ahh the smell of sizzling bacon mixed with the smell of gunpowder and weapon oil.

http://imgur.com/FEeq3.jpg


And the end result:
Crispy delicious well done bacon.

Ok

Today I was really really brave and went to one of the local burger places to get something meaty for lunch. While reading the menu I remembered that there is always a lot of fuss about bacon on reddit and therefore ordered a cheeseburger with fried (?) Bacon and Cheese.

After placing the order I had some doubts about this decision but now there was now way back...

After the plate arrived at my table I was _very_ skeptical

Ladies and Gentlemen!

It was...

delicious!

very DELICIOUS!

It was one of these ""OMFG, not really...) and I couldn't belive how I managed two survive all the years without bacon (This was clearly the best stuff on the burger).
