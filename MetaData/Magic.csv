Jokers247.  

I will try and post a review of something tomorrow. Not sure if im going trick or book yet.  

A note about myself. I consider myself a knowledgeable and skilled magician. I have been doing magic for around 13 years (with a little break thrown in there). I was. Member of the Magic Castle Junior Program from the age of 15-21. While a Junior i performed at the Castle during there Future Stars of Magic Week. Once i turned 21 i became an adult member and have been since. I worked in a magic shop for a year. I did magic semi professionally for a few years. I now do magic behind a bar twice a week and will be posting my number one bar set shortly for everyone. I recently built a formal close up act that is still being tested and am currently building a formal parlor act. My area of magic knowledge is close up and parlor.  

Once again thank you to all that read this and feel the same way that i do. Its all about involvement and i hope this takes off.

1371416339.0,1gh2ve,The dangers of magicians promoting pseudoscience,OstravaBro,34,12,7,"First off

I'm not a magician.

I have an interest in magic

One of the more popular magicians in the UK is Derren Brown. His patter involves him heavily suggesting that he isn't doing tricks at all, without actually revealing the trick.

The worst episodes were the lottery prediction explanation (wisdom of crowds) and the Manchurian Candidate episode. Both were done in such a way that someone who lacks some critical thinking skills could easily come away with a quite twisted view of how real life actually works.

At what point have you gone past tricking people and have begun to influence their world view ? When is a magician not just doing tricks but spreading pseudo-science ?

I saw a similar show on Nat Geo, some brilliant card tricks, brilliantly. The last 20 minutes he got onto muscle reading and reading peoples eyes etc all in a build up to a big stunt. The last 20 minutes I found really hard to watch.

Now, brilliant. This could make it worse though, in a way are people more likely to believe Derren Browns brand of bullshit because he has debunked other peoples bullshit ?

I'm just not comfortable when a magician goes beyond tricking people as part of the trick and begins to influences their world view just as much as psychics and people like Uri Geller do. He isn't selling a product

So where is the line ?

A magician has to be dishonest, don't they have some responsibility to the audience to fool but not mislead ? I feel the audience should leave a magic show knowing they've seen a skilled magician performing tricks well. They shouldn't leave thinking if they go and spend Â£5000 on a body language reading course they are going to change their life.

Is this a problem that is just isolated to mentalism ? It's a field of magic I have a real hard time with. I think it's probably a difficult balance to find in mentalism. No one actually believes anyone can fly or can saw a woman in half but the patter on mentalism is often just plausible enough sounding that people will believe it.

I find most mentalism to be incredibly patronising. I love watching a skilled magician fool me

*Beginner*

**NEW Modern Coin Magic** by J.B. Bobo - The bible of coin magic.  Has enough magic in it to last you a lifetime.  A little dated and not the easiest to learn from.
    There are several DVD accompaniments to Bobo's.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Ben Salina's which I've heard mixed reactions about.

**The complete introduction to coin magic** by David Amar (book)  - I have not watched this video

**Basic Coin Magic 1 &amp; 2** by David Stone - (DVD) A great DVD but a little advanced to to a first dvd.  Some great stuff though

**Expert Coin Magic videos volumes 1-3** (DVD) - Again

**In the beginning there were coins** by Jay Noblezada (DVD) - This is what I learned from

**Metal** by Eric Jones - The most modern way to start coin magic.  I have heard nothing but good things about it.  

*Intermediate*

**Expert Coin Magic** by David Roth (book) - This book will often be suggested for beginners

**Coin Magic** by Richard Kaufman (book) - in a similar vein to Expert Coin Magic.  This is a compilation of coin magic by some of the greats.  Again

**New York Coin Seminars** by asst. (DVD) - A HUGE collection of just about everything.  It is impossible to convey how much information is on this series.  Pretty much all you ever wanted to learn about coin magic is encompassed within this DVD series.

**Encyclopedia of Coin Sleights** by Michael Rubinstein (DVD) - very extensive list of coin sleights.  It is something every coin worker should own if you are serious about coin magic. 

**Covert Coins** by Charlie Justice (DVD) - This is a cheap DVD that has a lot of really cool stuff on shells.  I only mention this because it is a recent acquisition of mine and I'm really enjoying the material on it.  Not the greatest teaching

**Coin Classics Volume 1** (DVD) - Nothing revolutionary on here but a good smattering of lots of different effects to learn from.  A lot of the greats put forth routines for this DVD.

*Advanced*

**Sick** by Ponta the Smith (DVD) - This is difficult stuff.  Beginners who pick this up are led to believe they can perform the stuff on the DVD, but this should not be marketed as a beginner dvd.  That being said, it is inspirational to see how fluid Ponta is with coins.  His coins across routine is one of my favorites.  His shuttle pass if unbelievable.  His matrix stuff is lacking in my opinion.

**Sylvester Pitch** by Sylvester the Jester (DVD) - Really great utility move that is a bit difficult to master.  Teaches an amazing miser's dream routine that is performed out of your pockets.  

*Misc*

**Levent's Ultimate Guide to The Miser's Dream** by Levent (DVD) - A great resource for everything on the Miser's Dream.  If you want to learn this routine

**The Complete Muscle Pass** by David Kong - Excellent resource for the muscle pass

If we pick up from where we left off last time, and the remaining 99% of musicians doing covers of that material. When store-bought tricks entered the stage, a gap formed between performer and material. Itâs like playing a cover song: It will never really be your story to tell (although, there are a few exceptions).

By story, like living in a vacuum where the only art is magic. Try comparing your magic act to a movie; does your magic have the same ups and downs that the movie provides? What do you leave the spectator with? Do you have a vision? Does you magic leave anything other than a puzzle? 

So, we should quit? No. But it does mean that you should do everything in your power to remove anything that isnât you out of the tricks you buy. Only then should you start creating your presentation. In my book presentation isnât just about the words you say--thereâs so much more to consider. Think about your gestures, and not just from a deceptive point of view, but how it affects clarity of effect. Think about Teller and how clear his actions are; itâs because every single movement he does is aimed to enhance clarity.  Patter is to lessen our art to âDo the moves and say the words.â Thereâs so much more. Script your words, look at your gestures, routine it to fit the mood and practice the hell out of it, so you can improvise if you get the chance. Thatâs presentation

We as magicians have materialized our art. In essence

In my opinion
Casually play with your deck of cards at the table in your local Starbucks. Don't be obnoxious or overly obvious, or consumed in heavy business / romantic conversations. In short, they're 'ripe' for a bit of friendly disruption. 
Wait for a moment where you see someone (close enough to you without getting up) looking at what you're doing. Turn to them (and the group they're with, let me show you something I'm playing with. I really wanna hear what you think."" Flattery always works! 
""It'll only take a second
Notice my patter line is not overly mystical and I'm not coming on strong as a magician who's gonna fool them or mess with their head. I certainly don't come across as someone begging for spare change
The chances of them refusing you are almost zero.
Now engage them with the piece you're prepared to perform. That's it
In the one percent chance case they say no, and keep playing with your deck of cards. Remember, you still have 99 more chances to go.

The first gimmick can be used by anyone and is used for Jon Armstrongs routine which closes with the spectator cutting to their card.This Routine is brilliant, a thought of number of cards, and find a signed selected card with almost no effort. YOU CAN DO THIS TRICK IN ONLY A FEW MINUTES

The second plunger was designed by Matthieu Bich and has all the same abilities but the spectator cannot pick up even a single card with it. The gimmick is great but in my opinion Matthieu's routine is poor.

This trick is immediately funny and gathers the attention of all audiences. I have used it on laymen in the magic shop where I work and have gotten great reactions. I highly recommend it.

1368992496.0,1enb3x,My Number 1 Bar Set. Routine. As Promised,Jokers247,18,3,5,"Background: I work at a fine dining bistro and it has a small bar where i do magic. When appetizers are ordered it usually takes about 10-12 minutes for the food to arrive. So my goal was to have a routine to entertain while partrons waited for their food. i also wanted to use effects that were completely different from the previous effect. This isnt the end all be all of bar routines

Routine: Chop Cup
Run time: Aprox 8-10 min.  

Ill be brief on my presentation as i feel presentation shoud be unique to each performer. i will give my thoughts on props used, and why i think they work.  

Chop Cup: I usually open by saying ""are you familiar with the cups and balls? (quick explanation). i remember the first time i saw this trick i was 5 years old and the magician who performed it actually gave me one of the balls. i still carry it around to this day (bring in the ball). ive always wanted to do this trick but sadly i dont own a set of cups; so i looked around the bar to see what i could make do with and what i have is: a shot glass
The chop cup routine i do is a combination of Don Alan, do my thing, go into Larry Jennings' shot glass chop cup effect and close by using Don Alan. This is a great opener and it is so powerful. Doing this behind a bar makes the end so easy.  
Materials: I own a few chop cups but the one i use at the bar is the Ickle Pickle wide mouth cup because it looks like the base of a mini martini shaker. Shot Glass
Resources: Worlds Greatest Magic DVD on Chop Cup

Shot Glass Coins Across: This is a visual out of the hands,stepped, on the bar and covered by the shotglass. one by one the coins disappear from under the shot glass and end up in your hand. The last coin you make disappear and all four coins end up in the spectators hand (the final coin travel is similar to David Roths classic). I love coins across effects especially ones that involve a spectator. This effect is so visual since the audience can see the coins actually disappear under the shot glass. It also makes sense to me since you have a shot glass in play from the previous chop cup routine. Shaun uses a holdout for the last vanish but a holdout doesnt work for me. I am in the process of buying a tko 2.0 which will clean up the ending a bit.  
Materials: 4 coins
Resource: Shaun Robison's Penguin Live Lecture. Shaun is a woker and I am planning on reviewing this lecture at some point. But let me just say it is really great if youre a restaurant, strolling magician.  

My Favorite Card Trick aka The Chicago Quadopener.  
After years of performing numerous high caliber card tricks the one trick that consistently get some of the greatest audience reactions is just the standard simple version of the chicago opener. This is the chicago opener on steroids and it kills. It has a color changing deck
Materials: youll need a few things one being a rainbow deck. I use the spectrum deck (its expensive but worth it).
Resoureces: Super Charged Classics Vol.1 by Mark James (dvd).  

performances of the Chicago Quadopener and Don Alans Chop cup have been posted recently so theyre probably still on the first or second page. 

That is my number one set. three distinct tricks that with the right patter flow very nicely with one another. Working behind a bar makes certain aspects of the tricks that much easier. i also use a 7 by 12.5 inch close up pad.  
This set works for me and my performance style. The tricks are workers and each effect is incredibly powerful. I hope you Enjoyed reading this. I also appologize for any grammar errors.

A while ago, but quickly dropped it and went on to other things. I remembered it and told Strat about it the other night, and he's encouraged me to do it.. So here I am.

Basically, a trick you find technically challenging, or something thats fooled you. As long as it's not a flourish, and its not gimmicked, it's fair game. (Note: I will prioritize anything that is non-table based. I don't tend to work on a table, and I do plan on working on things to add to my repertoire first and foremost... I also suck at table work..)

My job is to take that trick that you post, and I post whatever happens. You guys will get to see me work on things, screw up, get frustrated, and have a good time.

The objective here is that at the end of this (whenever it does end) I have a few effects that are cool

So get on it! Send in those videos and lets see what I can do.

Focus by Phil Goldstein: I love packet tricks and there is some high caliber small card magic in this book. It has a great sleight index and all moves are described well. I use Masque

Anything by John Bannon...seriously
Dear. Mr. Fantasy by Bannon: Arguably this is the greatest card book to come out in the past 25 years. Not only are the tricks superb but theyre also layed out as full routines. In chapter three he takes a break from the traditional magic book formula and writes tricks in the form of a narrative. I loved this writing style. Beyond Fabulous is in my number 1 formal close up set and it is incredibly impressive. The best trick in the book is probably Dead Reckoning. How does someone come up with something like this. Its incredible and nearly self working.  
Smoke and Mirrors by Bannon: I love love love this book. This is the first Bannon book i came across and i was instantly hooked. The quality of his material is top notch and of an intermediate magic level. There are other effects besides cards in this book. His CSB routine is the one i use. I have probably gone through and am familiar with a half doezen CSB routines and this one is the baby bear of them all...its just right.  
Impossibilia by Bannon: His first and most varied book. There are cards
If you enjoy great close up you have to check out Bannon  

One Degree by John G: One of the best card books to come out recently. I have been familar with Johns magic long before he made his dvds. Its great to see the cream of the crop get put into book form. The quality of card magic in this book is top notch. Much like Bannon this is easily accesible for someone of an intermediate range. I cant really praise this book enough

The Card Magic of Nick Trost: This is a very special book and maybe one of the most underrated card books around. Nick Trost took some of the greatest card tricks and card concepets around and re-tooled them so that almost all of the sleights are removed. Thats right

Strong Magic by Dawrin Ortiz: This is a book on magic theory and performance ideas. Its great. It will make you a better magician if you read it and critically think about what is being presented to you. The fist chapter on clarity should be a must read for all magicians.  

Totally Out of Control by Chris Kenner: This book is crazy. Its funny. Its odd. Its full of great visual magic. This book covers all sorts of magic: cards

The Big Boys:  

Art of Astonishment: Paul Harris is one of my all time favorite close up magicians. This has all of his original books and then some in a 3 volume set. Get these books. The magic is great and his writing style is very witty. The volumes cover all sorts of close up magic with all sorts of traditional and weird objects.  

Apocalypse by Harry Lorayne and Kaufman (volume 1): I only own volume one and thats because this is one intimidating book. Its got so much magic that it can and will make your head spin. I wont go into the backstory of Apocalypse but its got effects from some of the greatest close up magicians of its time. Its got something for everything but youre going to have to find it.  

Collected Almanac by Richard Kaufman: If you like Apocalypse youll love the almanac. Its similar in style to Apocalypse and is also intimidating. Its got a great write up in the beginning that covers the history of Richards Almanac.  
What make Apocalypse and the Almanac great are their index sections. without these  these books would almost be impossible to navigate.  

Definitive Sankey Series: Jay Sankey has come out with hits and misses in his career. This book is full of the hits and there are about 500 of them. With time these will be looked at in the same way as the AoA series.

In particular I've really been enjoying card magic, I'd love to do this.  I'm thirty,"" but I've come to learn this is only related to magic in the most ethereal way.  Which is to say

Either I'm missing something, and it's really confusing.  Here's a short list:

*  No exposure!
*  Read books about magic.
*  Don't read books about magic
*  Everyone on YouTube is a dumb kid
*  Every magician is a hack
*  Not even Chris Angel has value as a magician
*  Who wants fledgling magicians anyways?  There is no possible way they may care about the deep and rich history of magic
*  All magicians are amazingly talented puzzle solvers

So what's the scoop?  I know that I must certainly be wrong here, but it's really disconcerting when every other interest I've ever had has been built with some expected sharing.

Now, maybe you spent years on it.  I get that.  It's yours, and you have something to gain by keeping it.  But there is more to it than that.

First of; I didnât practice anywhere near enough

Secondly; I was cocky thinking that if I can remember the chords sitting at home without  stage and sweat

Thirdly; I didnât print out the chords for the songs, and that I could remember the songs without a hitch, which was wrong, very very, very, wrong.

So what can we learn from my failure as a guitarist? Well the most obvious thought is practice, glide, control. But when that day comes when you've forgotten to keep that break and the card is seemingly lost forever youâll get mad at yourself for not giving the trick the attention it deserved. 

Something else to be learned is to always stack the odds in your favour, dare I say it, a stooge. Do anything to help you save the show.

The last and maybe most important thing to gather from this mess is experience. Something happens from experience that cannot be learned with a mirror, be it a card to wallet, a cull or an invisible deck.

âArtists erase reality to a greater or lesser extent

On the hunt for a quote I once read about inviting reality into you art, to changing reality, to expressing himself, to expressing yourself.

In Aristotleâs *Poetics*, reach a release in emotion (Catharsis). 

But this is an explanation of art in the sense of the two storytelling genres: tragedy and

For me, really, is finding a card truly magical? Or is it just an impossible feat that you achieve?

Magic comes from desires within: flying, vanishing, and so on. A classic question for magicians is: âIf you really could do magic, what would you do?â And it still holds up. What would you make or vanish or create if you were an actual modern day wizard (Donât you dare wear a robe!) 

Things that are connected with our reality have a greater effect on us. To make your problems disappear in a puff of smoke is a desire everyone has had. So when we create magic we should try to infuse it with some reality. Do everything we can to resemble reality for as long as we can

The quote I was looking for was something along the lines of âThe more reality you invite into your art


Itâs really about making your magic relevant to your spectatorâs reality

1373244327.0,1hu04j,Sunday Essay: Practice your heart out (literally),RC-Roi92,12,2,3,"Hey guys. Another Sunday essay about my endeavours as a guitar player, seeing as I had learned a bit from last week, which ended up being âGet Luckyâ by Daft Punk

We (being me and my girlfriend) decided on doing this gig Wednesday, and everything was doing fine, but suddenly thereâs this weird mood change. You guys may have tried it yourselves, but suddenly all you can think about is how much you suck, how everything sucks; youâre not prepared, youâre not supposed to be here, and you should just be in bed. So generally pretty negative thoughts enter your mind, so they donât ruin everything. It happens in a blink of an eye that those thoughts just destroy everything youâve fought so hard forânot because they erase your skills

So these thoughts make you doubt your own ability, it often comes from excessive practice. The type of practice where all the fun is sucked out of it and what youâre left with is just procedural madness? Thatâs a killer for me, when Iâve practiced so hard for so long that I almost feel like giving up. The bad thoughts keep creeping into your head, making you think, âitâs so obvious that Iâm about to do a move!â or make you doubt if youâll be funny or not. Now if time is not an issue, then at this time itâs a good idea to change pace and do something else, be it rewriting a particular line or thinking about another routine or walking your dog; itâs good to back out of the stress-zone and start loving your hobby again

Just push through it. Either youâll get over the thoughts, those thoughts are there when they have no reason to. Youâll often do better and work better when pressured, and thatâs why having the muscle memory to do so is vital. 

So Iâm running out of space and time (hopefully itâs still Sunday somewhere). Iâll return next week with a more in-depth discussion on the subject.

Second, and that will give it a tag that everyone can see on the main page. Right now, we have the tags ""Cards"", ""Coins"", and ""Feedback?"" The first two are a bit self-explanatory, apply them to any questions or discussions about cards or coins. The third is for when you want comments on a video of your magic, or whatever else you may be posting.

Before we dive too deep into this subject

â¢	Chords/Sleights

â¢	Melody/Effect

â¢	Lyrics/Patter

â¢	Performance/Guess what 

So, yet magic leaves us with a puzzled feeling? Why is it that music can make us cry and love every moment of it, while magic can only make us leap to illogical conclusions? 

I have a confession to make: I have a love/hate relationship with magic. I love it to bits for what it is. I love the impossible; to be able to live surrealism in our realistic world is the most amazing thing ever. What I hate is how people perceive it. They find it childish and, of course, our own. Somewhere something happened where magicians around the world thought it would be enough to do the moves and say the patter (a matter for another essay), and weâd be golden. Sure, Uncle Bob at Thanksgiving is going to be really popular with the kids when heâs doing the 21 card trick, but weâre artists (hah!); we need to carry a message. 

This is where I want you to think about why you became a magician. For me it was that one single amazing moment of astonishment. Paul Harris makes the point in AoA that the purest form of magic, it only lasts a few moments before our brains starts looking for explanations as to how this dissonance in reality came to be. 

Sure Iâll give you that the moment of astonishment is absolutely one of the best feelings in the world

In my opinion (I knew it would sneak into this thing), but more importantly, you will express yourself and your views, which is in some ways the essence of art.

It all depends on what level they're at.

What started as a lunch time magic jam with a few students, or the DVD equivalents; as well as any other resource that tells me they are learning elsewhere to supplement what I teach them.)

I began organizing them into skill groups so that I could focus on particular topics on given days. I also began giving them homework to practice. I started thinking about what I should teach next...and essentially everything I would do if I'd be teaching any other subject.

It had me thinking...""Could 'Magic' become a high school subject? Could it be like any of the other performing arts subjects like Art

Personally I think it could and I've thought out how I would limit how many people I taught; the skill range and dedication they need to demonstrate before being allowed more secrets; the order of the moves/skills are taught.

First of
I think this is an excellent example of the decline of the art behind the magic. Why do you want a store bought trick rather than one of your own creations? I buy as much material as any other guy(probably more) but the thing is that if we continue to perform the same effects with the same presentation we'll become uncreative and destroy the art. Just to make this clear, it will never really be our story to tell.
Rant off

* Dollar bills

* Business Cards

* Playing Cards

* Notepad paper(I used an old Sankey effect with one of the small notepads)

* Pre-cut sheets of paper made for folding

Now we have something to fold let's think about effect. Some may argue that we shouldn't think about this first

The 10 theories of magic are a good starting point in my opinion:

1. Production

2. Vanish

3. Transposition

4. Transformation

5. Multiplication

6. Penetration

7. Restoration

8. Suspension

9. Levitation

10. Mentalism

Personally I love the idea of pushing life into something static. Like the Daniel Garcia butterfly effect. So something as simple as making a nice swan and then making the wings flutter just enough to make the spectator dream, weeks, months or even years from now.

The book is The Collected Almanac by Richard Kaufman. Ive read a bit of this book before at the Magic Castle libarary and ive always wanted a copy of my own. The Collected Almanac was a monthly newsletter from 82-86 (same style as Apocolypse). Its hard to go through 175+ effects without owning it. Im glad to finally be able to add this to my personal library. Ive been doing Darryl's Cut to Kill from this book for awhile.  

The first dvd is Small Miracles by Helder Guimares. This is some top notch card magic. Helder is a FISM champion and this dvd shows why. Atleast two of the effects, a triumph/4king producing/color changing deck routine, a fantastic out of this world, and the last trick on the dvd is mind blowing. This isnt for begginers but should be in the range of intermediate to light advanced. Some tricks alao use gaffs, which i have no problem with. Gaffs not included.  

The second dvd is 21 Magic by Sweeden. This may be the best looking magic dvd around. The production value and visuals are practically movie quality. It has 10 magicians each doing around three tricks a piece. This ranges from: cards, coin moves, sleeving, bottle production...etc. the magicians are fantastic and im sure someone would find atleast three to four things that would interest them. Standouts for me so far are the: 2 ring and rope moves, a false shuffle, and a magicians force type trick...and thats just on the first dvd.  

With the few hits and many misses in magic i was so happy to get three quality items at the same time....i also got two little card wallets because you can never have enough of them.

So it got me wondering - how much editting is too much editting? Is it ethical to edit if it's in the context of a dual-reality effect and we pick the best POV? Should we only ever show what someone in an actual audience would see? In which case should it be the best placed member or the worse placed? Can we omit pre-show legitimately for some reason? Or should it all go in

It's easy to say 'no editting' at all but as we can see it's not just down to a choice of editting but also who's point of view to show to the TV audience as it being 'live'. It's a tricky call.

Consumers who are planning events want something unique, for them magic for adults is something unusual and memorable for their guests. For the magician it is a great marketing tool to get the word out about their services and differentiate themselves from the stereotype. This is how I stay at the top of my booking websites, I set myself apart by specifying I am an adults only close-up magician. That separates me from 90% of the other magicians out there who have branded themselves as family and kids party entertainers.

The problem is that most magicians think they can do both... You can't brand yourself as an adult magician and then have it be obvious you are doing 10 kids parties a week... although that is where the money is

------

I have performed magic in one form or another for nearly 20 years

And yet, it's rarely anything good. As far as performance arts go, actors, singers, musicians tend to rank higher on the proverbial food chain. Why?

One of the most common things you will hear, but there has always been plenty of bad movies, bad singing, bad musicians, bad painters, etc. 

Imagine if all a singer had to do was adjust his voice to create sounds of varying tonality and rhythm. Or if a guitarist simply needed to pluck strings on a guitar so sound is heard. By those definitions

When we fool our audience

Once we can manage to fool our audience

I believe the biggest myth in magic is to believe being fooled is a positive experience. Did the guy who got scammed at 3 card monte find it a fun time? Was it great to find out your wife is cheating on you? I will take the leap of faith and say

And yet, what we need to do next is soften the blow of being fooled. How do you do that? Change your patter? Reframe a presentation? Introduce a plot device? There are countless ways to tackle the issue... and I will save that for yet another thread, as this post is really about something else.

Although our main job is to fool the audience, and painters do something beyond their essential task of making vocal sounds, saying lines, and putting color to canvas. Your response to your favorites is beyond the mere recognition of technically sound singing. It is probably emotional and it is the production of that response you see as a fan of music.

So, I tend to not like ""theatrical closeup"" because so much of it banal and mediocre. They are often stories put around an effect and often turn out being more cute rather than emotionally satisfying. The masters of theatrical closeup are few. Ultimately, this leads to ourselves merely acting as... ourselves.

So what do you want to give your audience beyond the mere feeling of being fooled? For me, tragedy (Eugene Burger), horror (Christian Chelman), history (Ricky Jay) or be a storyteller (Hiawatha)? We often say our goal is to entertain the audience. There are countless ways to entertain an audience. When you say entertain, what do you mean? These are answers that can only be answered by yourself, for yourself. My goal is not to provide answers, just ask the question.

A monologue performer is merely a personality on the stage. Their personality and stories provide the means for provoking an emotional response. This is how we need to view our effects.

Do not perform effect after effect after effect for your audience only to provide the message ""I fooled you. And I fooled you again. And again. And I fooled you one more time."" We can be better than that.

Following are examples of some one person shows. Their essential task is to tell a story

Some clerical definitions: When I say ""the product"" I am referring to [Invisible by Damien Savina](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472). When I say video I am referring to my [review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1CIkjhqts) of Invisible.

**tl;dr** The use of ITR has been revealed by Ellusionist [here](http://www.ellusionist.com/thread-real-for-invisible-by-damien-savina.html) and by PenguinMagic in the product reviews [here](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472). Therefore, laypeople. It can be concluded that my so-called exposure has done nothing (in the sense of exposure) that hasn't been done.



About 3 months ago I posted [this review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1CIkjhqts) of Invisible by Damien Savina (and a written review [here](http://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=503910&amp;forum=109&amp;0)) It was posted with the intent to inform potential buyers what they are getting and not with the intent of revealing the details of the effect. Please note that (almost) all potential buyers are practitioners of magic. I reveal the use (and only the use, Rob Anderson declared my video to be exposure by posting ""This isn't a review. It's exposure. Why are you giving the secret away?ï»¿"".

This is my rebuttal.

By posting this video I show that an ITR is used in creating the effects shown in the trailer. I also describe, but the main difference in the effects are between laypeople, magicians who know about IT/ITR/etc.., and magicians who don't know about IT/ITR/etc...

Any layperson that watches this review will learn that IT and ITR is a thing that magicians use to create magic. This would add to the arsenal of any heckler wanting to spoil a show and would make this kind of magic less impressive to ""good"" spectators. This is assuming that a layperson would watch this review. I highly doubt a layperson will see the add for Invisible, 2013). If you google search ""invisible damien savina revealed"" you will find my video at the top of the page. So it is extremely accessible to anyone who knows the product I learned the effect from, but no layperson would know the product. If the layperson instead google searches ""ring levitation revealed"", my video is nowhere to be found. So as far as accessibility is concerned, only people who know where I learned the effect would be able to find my video, and those people would be magicians, not laypeople. From this we can conclude that if a layperson saw me preform this effect and wanted to find a revelation video, but in the unlikely event they found my video

So what about magicians? If a magician knows that IT is used in various effects, but sees the effect of that force (the ring floating). In fact, the general method to all of the effects on the dvd are quite trivial if the magician knows IT is being used (excluding the ring levitation); furthermore, the effects can easily be adapted to not use an ITR. Essentially, if a magician who knows IT purchased Invisible, they would be purchasing the details of the hookup, much like they would if they purchased [this](http://www.emagicsupply.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=102). The most important group of people (in my opinion) are the magicians who are not familiar

Magicians who are not familiar with IT who purchase this product will purchase it for a reason that falls between these two extremes: 1) to learn the effect and preform it, but this spectrum reveals a perverse truth about magic:

**The less savvy magician may purchase instruction of an effect with the little or no intent to preform

This is a problem with magic that I have discovered while writing this essay and requires further study that will not be done here. This truth raises two questions: 

*1) Revelation of magic is wrong. Is revelation of general well-known methods (such as the existence/use of IT

*2) Is selling the knowledge of the existence general well-known methods wrong?*

For example, it is the innovative hookup. This is less so for Invisible, as no mention of IT or ITR is in the trailer. So in some sense, knowledge of the existence of IT/ITR is being sold, but it is paramount to note, **AND THIS IS MY MAJOR POINT** that it *is* mentioned [here](http://www.ellusionist.com/thread-real-for-invisible-by-damien-savina.html). So any answer to the ethical questions that have been raised by the perverse truth I discovered are irrelevant in this situation because the use of ITR in the effect Invisible by Damien Savina **has been revealed by Ellusionist and has been revealed in the product reviews on PenguinMagic [here](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472).** A google search of ITR (when it is not abbreviated) yields [this result](http://www.thisismagic.com/html/invisible_thread_reel.html) at the top of the page. Therefore, revealing the use of ITR in the effect has already been done by some of the sellers of the effect. This revelation will be seen by magicians and few, laypeople. It can be concluded that my video has done nothing (in the sense of exposure) that hasn't already been done. It is arguable that my video propagates exposure

Next weekend I'll bring my camera out and show you guys a full show from beginning to end

First off, and was trying to tell everyone how it was done and that it wasn't impressive. So I said ""ok guys we're going to change the show up a little bit! I'm going to do a trick, and then she'll explain it!"" And then I did a muscle pass levitation that completely fried her brains lol. So by the end she was converted and wound up being a fan. So that's one good way to deal with hecklers if the situation is right.

Then cups and balls start, so if you think you know just keep it in your head and we'll see in the end if you were right!"" It's kind of pseudo-true because the ""explanation"" is mostly BS and an excuse for the final loads lol, but that line always works on people.

The end of the video is kind of ruined by some jerk who recognized my friend and wanted him to perform

Also, and people were just standing there watching, and it worked fine but I got way less tips. When I let people kinda just do whatever they want then they have more fun, and I make a lot more money lol. You can see examples of that several times in the video (1. The chick in the beginning is touching all over me, 2. The guys wanting to check under the cups 3. The other girl grabbing one of the balls 4. The guy picking up my limes and throwing them at the end.) 

Those are all things that would typically be discouraged and would be chalked up to ""bad audience management""

1319506718.0,lnuj7,What are a few of your favorite tricks? ,last2zero,10,4,19,"I'm curious what people's favorite tricks are. 

- Magicians Equivoque 
Is my all time favorite trick. 
With the majority of my tricks being mentalist based.. equivoque is the most natural force I know (and best working for me because of that). 

- Basic 14/15 split Book test. 
My favorite book test is also the easiest one I know how to perform. 
It requires that you pre-stack a deck in a 14/15 split. 
(a fundamental stack of mentalist right up there with the 8 kings stack)
It also requires that you get a peak at the first sentences on page 140 and 150 of a book you'll later force on a spectator via you're favorite method (mine again being equivoque). 

- Wounded by Robert Smith. 
(You learn 3 things: 1) Stop your pulse
By no means is that trick for everyone
It doesn't get a whole lot better than talking about walking the line between this side and 'the other' and than right in front of everyone 
tears of blood start streaming down your face :P
(I also once used this trick to get out of a major test in Uni)

- Super man coin bend is up there with my favorite fun tricks. I normally don't like to carry gimmicks around
Vid here: 
http://www.ellusionist.com/superman-coin-bend.html

- Electric Touch by Yigal Mesika
being able produce a static shock on demand has seriously heightened the level of ""omg"" during a performance. 
Think of this, static shock. 
Yes it's just a normal static shock

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa4sVTfSKas&amp;feature=player_embedded

- Extreme Burn 2.0 By Richard Sanders
The ability to change $1's to $20's in such a friggin clean way is amazing. This trick is most definitely worth the $35 (honestly I think it's worth quite a bit more and wish he hadn't released it past the initial limited amount). 

Anyways
People start saying
Everyone just sits there silent. 
(of course for kickers I then change the $20's back into $1's and count out the 3 $1's I have left and proclaim someone else is going to have to buy the next round because I'm broke! 
(You can watch a video of it here) 
http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/2120

- WTF ACAAN
It's to date my favorite any card at any number. 
The ability to not touch the deck the whole time, have them open the box, take out the deck and count down the cards (you could be across the room the whole time)... it's a great trick 
Video here: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riMkHRJntc


Edit: forgot these classics ! 

- Richard Osterlind's Breakthrough Card System. 
First off I should say watching Richard is what got me into mentalism. I had been doing regular 'magic' tricks for a good while before being exposed to the type of magic Richard preforms. It left me saying
... For the life of me I can't memorize a deck of cards. God knows I've tried. Because a good amount of tricks are based on a memorized deck
I consider it to be one of my most useful utilities to date. 
http://osterlindmysteries.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=15

- TnR (Torn and Restore) by Mathieu Bich
I'd never seen a TnR like this with such a ... wow.. twist to it. 
(While I don't preform it anymore since it doesn't fit into my current act.. it was always a kicker / still is when I do it for my friends).
Have someone pick a card out of the deck (lets say King of clubs). 
Shuffle the deck and flip over top card proclaiming to have found their card (in this case the top card welll say is a 6 diamonds).. 
The spectator says
You pretend to get frustrated and than you rip the 6D into 4 parts 
(yes you actually really rip it up). 
say.. wait actually let me show you a neat trick.. 
Take one of the pieces hand the spectator the other 3 and than slowly start to put the 4D back together right in front of them! 
As if this miracle wasn't enough....
You turn the card around (which has been in front of the spectator the whole time you've been putting it together) and boom.. its the King of Clubs.. with all the marks of being torn into 4 and pieced back together. 
It seriously leaves the spectator questioning themselves haha. 
Video here: (watch it... its super awesome !)

* I have or can obtain the materials needed to perform it.

So, and post it! I'll take the first number posted that meets my criteria above. (If the page lands in the middle of a trick, I'll flip back and learn that trick).

1372031625.0,1gxptu,Sunday Essay: When Character takes hold,RC-Roi92,8,3,12,"I thought weâd discuss a subject that in the recent years has gotten a lot of press. That is if you should have a character or not. Robert Houdin

The creation of a character is an important and vital step toward becoming a better magician. The way you can analyze and choose what your character will say or do without regarding your own personal prejudice is important. Itâs also important as a way for you to experiment with different styles without feeling put off because âit just isnât me.â So when creating a new character

1. Who am I?
2. Where am I?
3. When is it?
4. Where have I just come from?
5. What do I want?
6. Why do I want it?
7. Why do I want it now?
8. What will happen if I don't get it now?
9. How will I get what I want by doing what?
10. What must I overcome?

Those are taken from a [article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/may/09/character-building-great-actor) that I read a week or two ago explaining what makes a character great. The questions are for those with a script

Iâd like to compare us to engines at this point (I do a lot of comparing in this one). Now stay with me here, but can be helpful in character development.

But while one side of magicians find that having a character is paramount to the effect. Youâll have the other guys saying the complete opposite. The danger, that people will see right through the bullshit youâve worked so hard to buy. I tend to disagree, what makes you believable as anyone, is your ability to actually be anyone. If youâre a bad actor then of course people will see right through your act and think that youâre kind of camp. But doing it correctly will lead to a clarity of effect that is hard to create otherwise. Think about Apollo Robbins, now of course he has drawn a lot of his character out of himself, but heâs still a very âsmoothâ guy. His character is in every minute detail of his actions and effects. You could even say that without his character the show would lose its soul and theme. Same goes for Derren Brown, he has created such realism in his character that people actually believe that he has supernatural mind reading powers and that his skills surpass those of anyone else

Choosing material also becomes easier. You now donât have to think, suave James Bondâesque kind of pickpocket, and if heâs a nice fit for the jumping sponge bunnies, youâll know the answer as soon as youâve asked the question. 

If we look at the characters we see in movies, regardless if you create a character or play yourself.

1373162698.0,1hs4q2,Card to Mouth + Smoke,eriyg,6,2,11,"**tl;dr** I need a way to make smoke appear in my mouth and am considering Smoke by Alan Rorrison

I was watching some old wizard product reviews and I came across [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ILATfA22I&amp;list=UUp-UJCv7ACFtbpEEJx6E-Fw&amp;index=42) where they give an entertaining review of Shin Lim's S.S.S. I thought of purchasing it when it was released, because it was such a good effect. After pondering what they said I realized that it would be an incredible closer to many card routines. My goal became clear, learn/create this routine (not the exact same handling, but the same effect).

Getting the card into my mouth is simple, so weather or not the public nature of the images are ethical is up for debate (preferably not here). The gimmick looks unrestrictive and the magic cafe has nothing bad to say about it, so this is a good (and currently my only) candidate for creating smoke. There are two minor issues I see.

1) I looked at multiple dealers and there is a HUGE price difference between them. Penguinmagic and Theory11 are selling for $50 but [here](http://www.approachchina.com/smoke-by-alan-rorrison-p-593.html) it is being sold for **$11.50!** It says you get the dvd and gimmicked sharpie but nothing about smoke cartridges or the usb thingy (I have no idea what it is or is used for)

Here &lt;http://www.52magic.net/1558_Smoke-by-Alan-Rorrison-(DVD-+-GIMMICK).html&gt; they sell for $20 and say it includes the dvd+gimmick; I can't imagine it wouldn't come with cartridges+usb thingy

[Here](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-Smoke-by-Alan-Rorrison-DVD-GIMMICK-magic-tricks-magic-sets-magic-props-magic/601499096.html?tracelog=back_to_detail_a) is the same as the last one

So I don't really know who to trust should I decide to purchase this product.

The second issue I see, but that seems doubtful). So I need a more reliable source for the smoke cartridges. I heard that S.S.S. teaches a recipe for making smoke, is this true? Are there better recipes on better dvds/books that I can purchase? If I have a recipe for creating smoke ""cartridges"" (the fact that S.S.S. doesn't have any refills makes me believe it is taught on there, and therefore perhaps it is taught in other dvds/books) I think designing an apparatus to activate the cartridges and get the smoke into my mouth would not be entirely impossible; or is there a better gimmick sold that does such a thing? Or are homemade cartridges usable with Smoke's gimmick?

Answers to any of these questions would be appreciated.

I was really looking for a routine that didnt have too much pocket work, this is a great routine but it didnt fit my requirements.  

So i looked and i looked. I looked at routines by Dan Watkins: ""CSB ASSUALT"" from his Coin Man Walking dvd. good walk around routine, didnt clean up in a way that i liked. This routine will take some work and also uses a move that will scare off some coin workers.  

Cody Fisher: ""Real World CSB"" from his Unforgettable Coin Magic dvd. Another solid routine, needs a few extras. A good routine for sure but its not the one i use. 

Jeremy Pei: ""CSB Transformation"" from his Ultimate CSB Magic dvd. This is a must own dvd if you have a CSB set. Most of the routines need an extra something that most coin workers will have. This routine is a Classic CSB routine that has a really great ending. This is my second go to CSB routine. It doesnt involve a spectators hands unfortunately.   

Then i remembered that one of my favorite magicians, the fourth phase is killer). He has you use a house hold item to deal with noise issues, which is brilliant. He teaches you a new switch which is very convincing. The routine has spectator involvement. This routine is very visual. It ends clean in the spectators hand, huge plus. I love this routine. You can never go wrong with John Bannon's work. This routine is a worker!  

If you have a csb set dont let it collect dust. Use it. Search for Smoke and Mirrors book (also its one of the best books i own) and the Jeremy Pei dvd. If youre looking to get a csb set i hope some of this helped (if youre looking to purchase a set the Johnson set is a worker and not terribly expensive).
