So we already know what has officially been announced for launch/launch window so far

I'll be listing studios and what they could possibly be working on, so they will be listed even though they're working on Knack. 

Reminder, as well as co-developing (meaning they mostly help out other teams) studios such as SCE Foster City. 

If I miss anything

*It seems people are coming with more information especially from second party/devoted indie studios so I might add them to the list as well

**SCE Japan (Team ICO

* Last Guardian (Kotaku interview with Shuhei Yoshida claims [""it's still in active development
* Gravity Rush 2 (most likely a Vita-exclusive but there is slight possibility it could come to the PS4
* Siren/new (or old) IP 

**Polyphony Digital**

* Gran Turismo 7 (or possibly even a re-release 6 that comes with DLC or is at a lower price. Seems like /u/predanator linked some information that suggests GT6 will ""[appear naturally](http://gematsu.com/2013/06/ps4-gran-turismo-6-naturally-appear)"" on the PS4.)

**Naughty Dog**

* Totally new IP (following their pattern from previous generations, a new IP, etc. [Here](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/05/tloujpg-acb7c9_800w-610x381.jpg).) 
* Last of Us 2 (Thanks to /u/Finch313 for pointing out they now have 2 teams
* Jak 4 (Rumored [Never say never

**SCE San Diego**

* MLB 14: The Show 
* New IP 

**SCE Santa Monica** (pretty busy already with Order 1886 and Hohokum although those two titles are being co-developed)

* Playstation All Stars Battle Royale (how can it NOT come to PS4
* God of War (Ascension seems to indicate the want to make the series more of a multi-player game
* New IP. (Courtesy of /u/Lemondish - Some of the job ads pointed at an open world third or first person action game with guns, vehicles, and shooters*](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=428619). Here is another post definitely pointing to something NOT [god of war at all so that's interesting](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2012/04/19/game-director-stig-asmussen-doing-cool-stuff-at-sony-santa-monica-not-god-of-war-ascension/).) 

**Guerrilla Games**

* New IP (The wiki links to an IGN article that talks about how they're working on a killzone sequel for PS4 (shadowfall) and ""[talked about a new IP](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2011/11/18/killzone-follow-up-in-the-works)"". Could be a misunderstanding though.)

**SCE London**

* Singstar

**Media Molecule**

* Littlebigplanet 3 (although reports are swirling that it's being co-developed with Sumo Digital
* New IP

**Quantic Dream** (Second Party Studio)

* New IP (As /u/IceBreak pointed out

**SCE Bend**

* New IP

**Housemarque** (Second Party Studio)

* Super Stardust Successor
* New (or possibly old) IP (Courtesy /u/IceBreak. Here's some [more information](http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1937330/housemarque_developing_two_ps4_exclusives.html).)

**Zindagi Games** (Second Party Studio)

* New Motion game with Online Multiplayer (Credits to /u/Dinjooh


*No clear idea why I made the list but I thought it would be helpful to those of you who are wondering what your favorite first-party studio is up to

***Refresher*** (Studios that have announced PS4 titles

**Sucker Punch**

* Infamous Second Son

**Evolution Studios**

* DriveClub

**SCE Japan** 

* Knack

**Guerrilla Games** 

* Killzone: Shadow Fall

**SCE Santa Monica**

* The Order: 1886
* Hohokum

**As /u/PTG_ has pointed out
&gt; from SCE Worldwide Studios, are under development, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, Knack, inFAMOUS: Second Son, #DRIVECLUB and The Order: 1886.

Note: No specifications have been officially finalized but everything below has been officially announced.

###**Official Features**

***

* The PS4 allows people to resume games instantly upon turning on the system (no startup time) from where they were when they turned the system off. ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a018423/PS4s-Suspend-Mode-detailed-pick-up-games-right-where-you-left-off))

* All PS4 games (that aren't camera-based) should be playable remotely on Day 1 via Remote Play on the PS Vita. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/18ys2w/sony_exec_ps4vita_remote_play_will_work_day_one/))

* The PS4 will allow users to play games after downloading only a small portion of the game's data. ([Source](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/20/ps4-allows-playing-games-as-theyre-downloading/))

* Gamers can charge the DualShock 4 controller while PS4 is on standby. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/197exn/you_can_charge_the_dualshock_4_controller_while/))

* Share button functionality allows for quick screenshots or video upload of gameplay as well as sharing live streams of gameplay with friends or over USTREAM. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/19326z/people_seem_confused_about_how_the_share_button/))

* Users will be able take remote control of friends' games to help them through tough spots and such.  ([Source](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/20/playstation-4-game-streaming/))

* The system will launch with a headset that plugs directly into the controller for more prevalent voice communication across the PSN. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/18yddw/new_ps4_console_will_come_with_bundle_including_a/))

* Cross-game chat is officially supported. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196eq4/crossgame_chat_officially_confirmed/))

* The PS4 will **not** block used games.  Though publishers are free to do as they wish. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/190uv8/sony_blocking_used_games_on_the_ps4_is_a/))

* Game prices will range from $0.99-$59.99. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/191515/ps4_titles_will_be_99_cents_to_60/))

* All PS4 games will be available as digital downloads. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/191dec/all_ps4_games_will_be_available_as_digital/))

* The PS4 will support Move but not the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* A PlayStation app called 'PlayStation App' is coming to Android and iOS that allows the device to act as a second screen (a la SmartGlass) as well as purchase content and have it directly downloaded to your system. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18ycb1/sonys_playstation_app_for_ios_and_android_adds/))  It stands to reason that this will also include messaging on the go and other stuff like that.

* The PS4 will support 4K video output but not for games. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* The PS4 is 3D capable but it is not a focus. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* Certain apps can run in the background of games (such as the web browser) so you can access them without having to leave the game itself.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196k7x/the_ps4_allows_for_background_apps_much_like_the/))

**Unsupported**

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible** and thus cannot play PS3 games by default.  However

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

**Missing Stuff So Far**

* The System Itself - No biggie.  My guess it will be a black box with stuff in it.

* System Pricing - including if there will be tiered models or a PS Vita bundle.

* Hard Drive Size/Upgradability - What size HDDs will launch with the system and will they be easily upgradable like the PS3?

* Pressure Sensitive Buttons - Are the controller buttons still pressure sensitive like the DualShock 3's were?

* YouTube &amp; Twitter - They were both strangely missing for the apps page in the OS preview and USTREAM seems to be the official gameplay stream site of choice for Sony.  This could mean Xbox is about to announce something big in conjunction with YouTube.  ([Source](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/02/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-ps4-this-week))  Still, this shouldn't be a big deal.

**EDIT: I am slowly

***Thanks so much for the interest. I tried to do some quick replies

***Edited for clarity

Been noticing far too many ""What TV should I buy for the PS4"" threads with a ridiculous amount of misleading, but my frustration with the poor advice being slung around trumps my desire to ignore the problem.

Following the TL; DR is obviously a more in-depth explanation for my reasoning. Please


**TL;DR**

**1.) Plasmas are best for gaming, only buy Panasonic, and keep it in a cool, dark environment. Burn-in isn't an issue anymore. ~~Samsung cheats their plasma resolutions to make cheaper TVs. Avoid those.~~ &lt;-- Pending source.** *EDIT: Interesting source found.*

*EDIT: I will leave that portion crossed out, and for subpixel rendered displays in particular, led many people to question the resolution claims of PenTile display products.""*

*-[From Wikipedia on PenTile matrix displays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family)*

One can tell with the naked eye that they are absolutely using a PenTile matrix, but you can tell something wonky is going on with the picture, and appears to have blank pixels, or portions of the screen which appear completely unused as there are observable gaps in the pixels that never change from black. I'm not a fan of this, and find it very off-putting, as it plainly looks as if the T.V. is missing pixels.

**2.) If you can't go bigger than a 32""

**3.) 120hz 32"" are mostly bullshit. Avoid them. They are a waste of money.**

**4.) If you're going above 32"", otherwise these TVs will cause input lag and ruin your gaming experience.**

**5.) Overall, and Sharp being very close 2nd places.**

**6.) Passable cheap TVs are Toshibas, they tend to fabricate their numbers.**

**7.) If I haven't listed a brand

**8.) From user Harkster

**9.) On ANY TV, noise filtering, and the like as they might look flashy and pretty at first, but not only do they cause huge input lag, they literally erase important details from your image!**

Why should you listen to me? Yes,"" as quoted from my customer's own words. My interest in televisions and their tech goes back more than 10 years of not only buying several myself, selling to my friends, family, and consumers, plus tons of internet research and boat loads of forum discussions with professionals as well as IRL professionals, and few years of hands-on installations both big and small.

And yes, on with it, then...

**Refresh Rates!**

First of all, 240hz, (and 600hz which is completely different, but I'll get back to that) etc. Almost everyone is universally suggesting get ""atleast 120hz."" This isn't entirely a great idea. First of all, 120hz and 240hz are not native refresh rates. In fact, they're not technically refresh rates. That's a simple way of saying that there are usually motion correction settings available to the viewer. These motion settings are awful for gaming and buying a 120hz TV will do nothing but give you input lag (among other issues like haloing) and worsen your gaming experience so long as you aren't privy to the fact that you can turn these options off.

**Well, the TV can decide what frame might be best to go in between these two and it creates that artificial image to place in between the two frames in order to ""smooth"" the movement.

**Why is this awful for games?** Well, and what the TV does is it delays your image, gathers the first frame and the following frame registered from your tilt, creates the artificial image, then finally shows you the product of that button press at a delayed response.

Besides gaming, I guess. I think it looks horrendous, but we'll stick with ""subjective.""

If you feel you must get a 120hz or 240hz TV, Motion smoothing, Cinema Smooth, de-judder, de-blur, or whatever it might be called on your particular brand of television.

**What the hell is 600hz

600hz is an entirely different thing altogether. It's not at all similar to 120 or 240. Considering technology at the time of this writing, 120, or 240. Every frame is perfectly crisp no matter how fast the action. There's more to it than this, but we'll leave it at that.

* The PS4 allows for only one system to be offline activated per account (multiple accounts can be activated on the same system).  This means you select a single PS4 to be your ""home console"" for a particular account and in doing so you can download and play digital content offline on the system.  This has nothing to do with physical media. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1i5sd7/its_official_the_ps4_allows_for_only_one_system/))

* You can play your digital games on any console while logged in to your PSN account and constantly connected. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1i5sd7/its_official_the_ps4_allows_for_only_one_system/))

* The friends list limit will be 2000 on the PS4 (and subsequently the PS3 and Vita as well). ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1j9sn0/ps4_party_chat_confirmed_not_behind_paywall_the/))

#### Features NOT Supported on PS4

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible.**  Thus it cannot play PS3 games by default.  However

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* The PS4 will not support *at least some* of the PS3's fight sticks. ([Source](http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/54655/ps3-mad-catz-tournament-edition-fightstick-is-not-compatible-with-ps4))

* The PS4 will not support CDs or SACDs. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/19denj/ps4_wont_support_audio_cds_does_anyone_actually/))

* The DualShock 4 will not have pressure sensitive buttons (unlike the DualShock 2 and DualShock 3).  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1b4o0r/the_dualshock_4_will_not_have_analog_buttons/))

* The PS4 cannot use the Vita as a second controllor option unless the developers program in that functionality manually.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1j38l0/ps_vita_cannot_be_used_as_a_second_controller/))

#### Missing Stuff So Far

* When will it launch?  

* Backwards Compatibility Questions (Gaikai Cloud Streaming)

 * Will one's PSN purchase history will carry over to the cloud gaming service?

 * Will we be able to insert a disc and access the cloud version of that game while the disc is in the system.

 * Will the cloud gaming service will require an additional charge (or even tiered charges) or just allow for game purchases?

* Will trophies instantly sync on PS4 like achievements do on Xbox 360?

This particular individual is very good about breaking Sony info

He wrote a post detailing why we shouldn't be up in arms

""I told myself I wasn't going to post in this thread because people are foaming at the mouth and not thinking.... but here I am


First off


I was told by a couple of Devs in the lead up to E3 that the OS footprint was ""bigger than expected"" but not a single one of them complained about it. No one is in danger of running out of ram. As some people have mentioned in this thread - games like the The Last of Us are happening with 512mb of ram. Launch titles

So why is the ram footprint bigger than expected? It's fairly simple - Sony is hedging their bets. They were absolutely caught with their pants down with their OS this gen. Not having the memory overhead to do things like Party Chat gave Microsoft a huge advantage when it came to online gaming

But the thing that I'm hearing and I believe there was even a line dedicated to this in the eurogamer article is that these numbers aren't set in stone. The fact of the matter is that high end PC games use around 3gb of ram and use higher res textures (art tends to take up the largest chunks of ram) than the ps4/x1 do. The idea that launch games need 7gb of ram is absolutely ludicrous. 4gbs is fine. Anything more

So Sony gets to sit on this chunk of ram, devs, you guys get this."" The systems will launch and they will look at what people are doing with their own OS, they will see what features people are asking for, they will see if microsoft or Nintendo (or even steam) come out with some surprise feature that catches fire - and if it does they will have the memory there to be able to do it also. If it doesn't that chunk of ram gets freed up for developers.


This thread is looking at this entire thing like the endgame is the day it launches. That's day one, a smart one. They are putting themselves in a position to be able to adapt... something they couldn't do with the ps3. I know as gamers all we want to hear is higher numbers. But find me one developer that thinks the ram available to them on either system isn't enough (and this goes for the x1 as well guys... all this 5gb hurr hurrr stuff is fanboyish nonsense that you can go through my post history and see I never took part in once).


I feel like this post is far to philosophical for this thread of LARGE NUMBER &gt; SMALL NUMBER

***

Original Announcement:

A change to the subreddit layout is coming (it will be up shortly after this post).  Much of the hard work was thanks to /u/PineappleMeister.  It is still a work in progress (at least with RES nightmode) but it's close enough to launch.

There's a lot of visual tweaks but the actually important ones off the top of my head are:

* 5 updatable buttons (Greatness Awaits
* The announcement bar can now span the page and will hide excess text based on browser width.
* The submit buttons have been renamed 'Link' and 'Text' and are opposite each other at the top of the sidebar.
* The message the mods link at the bottom of the page has be transformed into a button below the submit buttons.
* Posts now have a left border that changes when you hover.
* Two linkflair colors (green and red) have been added which mods alone have access to.  This will be used similar to /r/Games to mark certain less-than-accurate posts for the most part.
* The blog and store links are now buttons in the sidebar.

There's plenty more changes but most of that is just appearance.  Our goal was to make a more unique and useful layout without making it more difficult to view the subreddit.  

**Remember: This is a ton of changes so there will likely be some compatibility issues for some.  Please let us know any you encounter and we will try to fix them.**  If you're using an older IE browser and have issues well... you'd probably be better of using the mobile link instead: http://www.reddit.com/r/ps4/.compact",self,t5_2rrlp,1372221700.0,default,sce,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1h29yr/rps4_v20/

What does it mean for the PS4?

Specifically, which isn't an issue for either console since they're both unified memory architectures. This does matter for PC though.

Here's the good news: OpenGL already had an implementation of this, has a native hardware implementation of this called Partially Resident Textures (PRT). So, Microsoft is simply exposing this to their developers by implementing this in DirectX. 

As a general rule, since they share the GCN architecture, Microsoft can't expose some super secret hardware feature that PS4 can't use. 

For those interested, but won't have hardware acceleration. Moreover, since this is a space saving technique (at the cost of more computation), it's unlikely to be needed early in the lifecycle of consoles with 8 GB of RAM available. ",,False,self,False,t3_1hi47b

1372104983.0,1gzo29,The PlayStation App,RedPandaAlex,76,12,39,"Sony has announced a new PlayStation app for Android and iOS that allows users to not only interact with PSN (buying and installing games and such) but also to interact with in-game content. I'd like to open a discussion on what we think the scope of this app might be

Here are the examples of game integration that Sony has put out so far.

* Drive Club (http://youtu.be/RiNGZMx2vhY?t=58m41s)
* Watch Dogs (http://youtu.be/kPYgXvgS6Ww?t=5m24s)
* Playroom demo (http://youtu.be/qSTJc9UqNk8?t=2m25s)

In the playroom demo they specifically say that this is one app for all games (though it's unclear whether that would be the case for cross-platform titles like Watch Dogs). They also say that the interaction is through a wifi connection between the mobile device and the PS4

It seems like it would be really hard to make this work well on both iOS and Android. My best guess is that Sony will have a limited SDK that helps developers send data back and forth to the PS4 and segment their content within the PlayStation app

As for use cases

* Scheduling events and networking between players (Drive Club).
* A second player interacting with the game using a touch screen in a similar manner to some Wii U games (Watch Dogs).
* Creating objects by drawing them on the touchscreen and putting them into the game (Playroom demo).

These are some other ideas.

* Allow you to access your character status, inventory, etc when away from the game. This could include allowing you to use skill ups, discard and transfer inventory, and more.
* In games where you collect books, you could access those later on your mobile device rather than on your tv in the middle of play.
* Access maps and quest/mission information.
* Using it as an input device instead of typing using the controller.
* Using it for character appearance customization.

Personally, but it's awkward and hard to read on my TV."" And pushing some communications/networking functions to mobile devices could make it a lot easier to manage groups for co-op gaming.",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,psn,

When *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* came out, but it probably had to with the PS3's astronomically high price when it came out due to the early Blu-ray adoption.

Sometime late last year I just became completely fed up with console gaming, and I found the modding community for my favorite games, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas.

It was in December of 2012 when I started planning my move to PC gaming. I extremely quickly ruled out pre-built and brand name gaming computers within the first hour of my research. The only real option was to build my own. Building my own PC was probably the funnest thing I've done in a long time.

I finished my build in February

Now E3 has come and gone, and now that it is out of stock, I just can't bring myself to cancel the pre-order. I actually want this new console for some reason.

That post was a nice start but there's a lot of things we'll never find out in there as well as quite a few omissions.  The questions below are all ones I feel are both pertinent and ones we'll have definitive answers on by 2015

***

* Release date?

* Launch titles?

* Launch ""window"" titles (six months)?

* Will there be an HBOGO app in the next 12 months?  Skype?  TwitchTV?

* What is the drive speed of the stock HDD?

* What kind of internal drives are supported as upgrades?

* Can external HDDs be used to expand storage like on the Xbox One and Wii U?

* Can a thumbdrive be used to as a save destination?

* Can the cloud be used as a save destination or strictly as a backup?

* Will the PS+ storage on PS4 still cap at 1 GB?

* Can game audio be streamed to the DS4?

* Can the PS4 camera be used a mic for game chat?

* Will playing online multiplayer have any negative effect on Remote Play?

* With the 2000 person friends list

* Can you turn off trophy and other notifications?

* Will trophies instantly sync on PS4 like achievements do on Xbox 360?

* Can you remove games from your trophy list which haven 0% earned?

* Can you remove (or hide) games from your trophy list that you have earned one trophy or more in?

* Will the PS4 camera allow for any voice commands?

* Will users be able to create/customize a ""start"" tab with only the item/boxes/content that they want to see?

* What are the limits for multitasking?  Will background apps remain loaded?

 * For example

 * When switching to Netflix

* Will Multiple accounts on the same system work as it does now (aside from the accounts having to pick that system as their ""home console"")?

* Will native custom soundtrack support be implemented?

 * If so will it replace the music track of all games like the 360 does or overlap the music tracks of some (or all) games like the Vita?

* Just to confirm

* Any migration plans for things we've bought on PSN?

* Will all PS4 games have demos?

* Can we digitally gift games to friends?

* Can users change there PSN ID? (For a fee?)

* Will every online multiplayer game support dedicated servers?

* Can all PS4 games be pre-ordered digitally?

 * If so (even if only some can) can digitally pre-order games be pre-loaded and playable at midnight?

* Will your PS4's friends list match your PS3 and Vita's friends list?

* Will sub accounts be allowed to spin off into their own master accounts?

* Can we change the region of our PSN accounts?

* Can you save DVR'd game videos locally or must they be uploaded or discarded?

* Can you export your videos to an external drive?

* Will Gaikai games be free if that game's disc is in the system?

* Is PS Home going to be on the PS4? If so

1371127707.0,1g9j02,An idea for PS4 Multiplayer dilemmas (aka; i have no friends),Merovee,60,8,55,"I am really excited for the new PS4

The idea is this:

We gather a group of 15-20 people that have more or less the same interests when it comes to what we want out of games. We find each other on PSN

With enough people, and not just go through /r/playdate, is so that there can be a familiarity between players, sorta like the guilds in mmorpgs used to be. 

The general ""hope"" for this would be a group of people that know each other through the PSN

It would be awesome if PSN allowed grouping of friends into guilds, and one guy is playing knack. Then you could join in and hang out with people you know (at least some), instead of the normal randoms.

I hope i get my idea across to you
The reason i like this idea is that for a 25 year old guy, the same schedule and so on, more often than not you play alone, or not online at all.

The creation of a gaming ""group"" or something, when we want. (And make some new friends in the progress).

TL;DR: Destiny looks more fun with other people joining

However, and that frustrates me.

So I want to know fellow Sony fans

* Not allowing previous PS+ and PSN purchases to be available through the Gakai service. This one is probably the biggest worry I have for the PS4. I have a large library of games I've gotten through PS+ and due to the PS+ discounts. I think the total is somewhere around 50. I would be incredibly upset if all the purchases I've made I would have to make *again* for Gakai. I refuse to pay twice for access to games from Sony when I've already done so **and** they're tied to that exact same account.

* PS Vita remote play not working as advertised. As I understand it, as a Vita owner, to have the ability to play Watchdogs or Drive Club from the comfort of my bed or while lounging in the student union.

* This is highly unlikely

The net is ablaze with laughter and ""WTF Microsoft!?"" videos

Microsoft's reveal was a disaster because of the lack of games on show

But...maybe they just struck first with the bad news?

Sony have said ""Used games will work on the PS4.""

That doesn't really answer anything

Yoshida from Sony has said

*""That's my expectation, Yoshida stuttered. ""Ummm ... yeah. We have to really name our system services to explain more about it,""*

That last part just worries me.  I'd put money on them having a new service system coming

They've answered the question

""Will 2nd hand games work on the PS4?""

""Yes""

Is what has happened.

Now I'm thinking the ACTUAL answer

""Yes, if you are subscribed to PlayStation Plus.  If you aren't subscribed, you have to pay a fee equal to the full price of the game, or subscribe to PlayStation Plus.""  

Basically like Microsoft's retarded DRM.

""You never said anything about fees or requirement to be subscribed to the new service! WTF SONY!?""

""Well

I'm getting a PS4 as I love the PlayStation exclusives (I hate Halo etc).

I just think there's a good chance that Sony are going to piss us off somehow at E3 with a DRM reveal.

Because it seems PS4 buyers are laughing at Microsoft due to the DRM on 2nd-hand games

When...there seems to be no official response to it yet.

Are we counting our chickens before they hatch?

I was browsing through my PS3's games and came across some games that brought up really good memories. Then I came across the gem of [MAG](http://imgur.com/Yn9Ohlv) which really was one of my favorites. A game by many doomed to fail. All because they thought it would be a giant Lag-Fest due to the 256-player matches.

Just a ~~not~~ ~~so~~ brief introduction to people who don't know what MAG is.

MAG was created by Zipper interactive, bringing our many patches, multiple DLC's consisting of minor free packs to larger packs with new maps, game-modes, weapons and vehicles. They even released a 2.0 patch bringing in an economics system and a whole washlist of patch notes and fixes.

Players were given the choice of three PMC's (Private Military Companies)

 * Valor

 * Raven

 * SVER - Seryi Volk Executive Response

Who they would fight for on multiple gamemodes

The PMC's would fight battles on 32v32 servers
 Then there was the Major Gamemode of MAG, overtake the enemy's fueling station.

Then the next two gamemodes were DLC, which I don't know anything about because I didn't have the money to buy at that time, and when it was free on PS+ no one had it so I still couldn't play it.

The game was maybe not too visually pleasing, and both leadership positions granted perks for surrounding friendlies.

on 64 player teams there were 2 platoon leaders both commanding 2 groups of 4 squads.

and lastly on 128 player teams there was another chain of command. Which was the Commander

So after the introduction I'd like to tell you why I want a follow up to this game.

I think the game was ahead of it's time, even though I was always communicating). That is where the game maybe lacked a bit. A small bluetooth headset to come with every copy of the game would have massively increased the potential of MAG.

Now the PS4 is way more powerfull than the PS3 and I think a new MAG game would be good to put forth relatively quickly since a lot of newcomers are entering the first person shooter market trying to knock Battlefield and Call of Duty of their thrones. 

I hope there is more people in here who think the same. At least I can sleep with a rested heart knowing that I have at least tried to get a follow up on one of my favorite games.

- Transport vehicle crashes and the conduits escape
- DUP sets up roadblocks and won’t let anyone enter/leave
- Lots of security systems are sent out and Seattle is turned into something reminisint of an airport
- There are elevated walkways with search-lights and security cameras as well as checkpoints and scanners
- Game has parallels to post-9/11 America setting
- Security vs. freedom theme
- DUP is like the TSA

DUP guards

- DUP guards feature behavior similar to that of SWAT teams/trained military police
- Others have a seemingly supernatural ability to shield themselves and move around quickly
- Sucker Punch won’t elaborate on this further

Protagonist

- Stars 24-year-old Native American Delsin Rowe
- Delsin is the artistic type with a chip on his soldier
- Fan of anti-authoritarian street art
- Likes tagging buildings with his own art
- Very much an average guy until the conduit-transport vehicle crashes
- Delsin tries to help those in the wreck
- Soon realizes that he can control smoke
- Natural power lets him absorb other conduits’ power
- Can use more than smoke power
- Delsin is excited about his power unlike Cole

Gameplay

- Delsin can take down different forward-operating bases run by the DUP around Seattle
- Can get through these areas with force
- Smoke projectile at Delsin’s disposal
- Also can perform a smoke-dash maneuver somewhat like Nightcrawler
- Air ducts found all across Seattle
- Can use the ducts to get around or climb like Cole
- Another technique lets Delsin throw smoking fireballs
- When Delsin descends
- Forests act as the edge of the game world

General

- Sucker Punch recreated the city’s feel instead of specific road layout

What [Jack Tretton] talked about [on GameTrailers] is with the offline portion, it's now taken care of at a platform level by PS Plus.

""Tretton was on record during a GameTrailers interview saying that The DRM decision is going to have to be answered by the third parties, or mandate, or implement."" But it's been made clear that the SCEA head was simply referring to redemption codes and online passes that have been in use this past generation. Sony has no hardware-level online checks or used game restriction technology in the PS4.

#### Missing Stuff So Far

* When will it launch?  

* Backwards Compatibility Questions (Gaikai Cloud Streaming)

 * Will one's PSN purchase history will carry over to the cloud gaming service?

 * Will we be able to insert a disc and access the cloud version of that game while the disc is in the system.

 * Will the cloud gaming service will require an additional charge (or even tiered charges) or just allow for game purchases?

* Game Install Size - Will the PS4 still require double the memory of a game to install it like it does on the PS3?

* Will trophies instantly sync on PS4 like achievements do on Xbox 360?

* What will be the new friends list limit (if any)?

**A:** Recycled news and interviews from other sources.  There are exceptions like pieces focusing on a particular aspect of an interview but that's a thin line to walk.  If there's an English source you can post

**Q:** What isn't considered blogspam?

Original content like reviews and editorials.  This is unless it's from an account that just mostly posts links from that particular site (and

**Q:** But why are IGN/Giant Bomb/Joystick/Polygon/etc. not considered blogspam when they aren't the source for something?  

**A:** They pretty much are considered blogspam in that instance.  We're just less likely to remove them because they are also pretty significant news makers themselves and folks have a harder time seeing the difference.  If you want to post an IGN/Giant Bomb/Joystick/Polygon/etc. review or news story they broke, recycling info from the PS Blog, we still **strongly recommend** posting the PS Blog link instead.

- Killzone Trilogy(With online co-op)

I'd like to see Last Of Us and Beyound too

1370638840.0,1fvypn,PS4 Mid - High System (From a PC User with &lt;3),FlyByDerp,37,10,36,"I would say medium to high range. 

The GPU on this system is no joke
  

On top of that I only use 8GB of DDR3 since GDDR5 can't be used on PC's for system memory
  

  The CPU is a different story but hey the Jaguar is not bad considering developers will finally be able to make a game use more then 2-4 cores which is great and on top of that everyone seems to be getting the Bobcat CPU and Jaguar CPU mixed up
  

TL;DR  
GPU = 7850 - 7870 with 8GB GDDR5  
CPU = Jaguar 8 Cores at 2GhZ+  (Bobcat is the one that runs 1.6Ghz)  
RAM = 8GB GDDR5 with 5500Mhz (System Shared between CPU and GPU/Still BOSS)  
Conclusion: Mid - High  (Day 1 purchase for me)
    

Also here's a pic I took on my PC to show the comparison between mostly the GPU on the PS4 and my 7850: [7850 vs PS4 GPU](http://i.imgur.com/uvrbHAx.jpg) EDIT: Updated PIC

    
I got ask a question as to why the Memory Speed on my GPU compared to the PS4 GPU has the same memory bandwidth at a lower speed 1375MHz vs the 5500MHz it is showing well heres a run down  
  
    
That's the effective speed of the Memory. Because GDDR5 is ""quad pumped


This is found on most modern graphics cards and RAM.  
- DRR3 1600MHz RAM is really running at 800MHz. (800 x 2 = 1600MHz)

So

Sony told developers PlayStation 4 was equipped with 4GB of system memory, in order to misdirect their opponent—and if we consider the second of these possibilities to be true, is this the only ace up their sleeve?

Sony is vague about other key components. Take the GPU for example. Mark Cerny has [commented](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/): ""It's ATI Radeon. Getting into specific numbers probably doesn't help clarify the situation much

Are Sony confident enough with their design to stand-up first and boldly announce all they have, purposely holding back other important details? Analysts say Sony's design approach has more flexibility, leaving open the possibility of last-minute suprises.

Sony do seem convinced they have the better hardware, and they're trying to actively push 60 frames per second, 1080p."" There were [reports](http://ps4daily.com/2013/02/playstation-4-cpu-runs-at-2-ghz-rumor/) soon after the February press event that the CPU clock speed is set at 2 GHz and not 1.6 GHz as currently believed.
