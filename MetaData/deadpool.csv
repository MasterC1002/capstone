As we all know, he was witness to the cold blooded murder of his parents. It's just common knowledge to most by now. But that situation changed Bruce Wayne, the boy, into The Batman, a masked crusader of the urban world. So what put Deadpool where he is? The Weapon X project. The very same mutant experimentation processes Wolverine endured. But there's more to it.

Wade had a skill and that was killing. He was hired by the government and was ruthless. A lot of his past is shaded and vague as we may not want to know everything he's done and he, but most of all, he enjoyed killing. Then, suddenly, life came to a halt and he realized that his own life had no true meaning to it and was seemingly a waste, as he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 

But there came hope soon after

The Weapon X project leaves a blood soaked path. Wade probably more ruthless than ever as to vent his frustrations of hatred towards those who've wronged him in the past, and to the hatred of himself. 

Treatment finally begins and all does not go well. Long needles stab into him from every direction, electronic pulses in his brain begin to flash memories of the horrors he's lived and created and he can feel every one of them like never before. The cancer suddenly spreads rapidly through him; bones, skin, and all his vital organs are suddenly cancer ridden as the pain continuous to increase. His body would simply shut down at the point, but the healing factor is holding him on the brink of death, that he is by now letting out blood curling screams, pleading for that push to the other side. Eventually, and he passes out, he shouldn't be able to move, breaking your fingers

The screaming wouldn't stop. The flashes wouldn't stop. Wade Wilson was cast aside as simply a botched science project. Again, to come to a sense of his surroundings, to stand, to speak, and to bury his pain, his furious anger, and his self-loathing by making himself laugh
