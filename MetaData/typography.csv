&gt; WHY THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD
&gt; 
&gt; A Hermit was living in the forest
&gt; 
&gt; Once the Hermit lay down under a tree, a Stag, and a Snake gathered in the same place, to pass the night. The animals began to discuss why there was evil in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; The Raven said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""All the evil in the world comes from hunger. When I eat my fill, and everything gives me pleasure; but let me just go without eating a day or two, and everything palls on me so that I do not feel like looking at God's world. And something draws me on, and I fly from place to place, and have no rest. When I catch a glimpse of some meat, it makes me only feel sicker than ever, and I make for it without much thinking. At times they throw sticks and stones at me, but I do not give in. Oh
&gt; 
&gt; The Dove said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""According to my opinion, the trouble would not be so bad. One head is not poor, and if it is, it is only one. But here we live in pairs. And you come to like your mate so much that you have no rest: you keep thinking of her all the time, wondering whether she has had enough to eat, and whether she is warm. And when your mate flies away from you, you feel entirely lost, or men may have caught her; and you start out to find her, nothing gives you any joy. You do not eat or drink
&gt; 
&gt; The Snake said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""No, but from rage. If we lived peacefully, without getting into a rage, everything would be nice for us. But, as it is, whenever a thing does not go exactly right, we get angry, and only hiss
&gt; 
&gt; The Stag said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""No, or from hunger does all the evil in the world come, but from terror. If it were possible not to be afraid, everything would be well. We have swift feet and much strength: against a small animal we defend ourselves with our horns, and from a large one we flee. But how can I help becoming frightened? Let a branch crackle in the forest, or a leaf rustle, and I am all atremble with fear, and I fly as fast as I can. Again, and you think that it is a beast, and get killed. We have no rest. All the evil comes from terror.""
&gt; 
&gt; Then the Hermit said:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Not from hunger, not from terror are all our sufferings, but from our bodies comes all the evil in the world. From them come hunger, and love, and rage, and terror.""
&gt; 
&gt; *Fables for children

**Some things to consider**

* There are five speakers
* There is direct and indirect speech.
* It is a fable for children.
* Fables  teach.
* It is from the 19th century.
* Tolstoy was a Russian writer.

**Trivia**
