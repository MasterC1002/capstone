1373290185.0,1hv1ut,Former shy here. I recently did a 30-day social experiment in which I talked to at least three strangers every day. Here's what I learned.,slass-y,1487,279,100,"(I did this for my blog which is all about self-development

Small backstory: First 22 years of my life was painfully shy

**My five biggest takeaways:**

**1. Pursue Your Passions**:  Not surprisingly, be it CrossFit, swing dancing, or hanging out in coffee shops.

Many in my generation seem to be under the impression that friends will just apparate like they did in grade school and college. Sorry, as the more you put yourself out into the community, the more you will begin to see the same people.

**2. Hot and Un-bothered:** One limiting belief I used to have towards starting conversations in public was that I would be bothering people. Sure

How I like to think about it is this- if I were in that person’s situation, or not mind at all?

99% of the people I talked to were extremely polite back- people in general are nicer than we give them credit for. And the two or three people (out of 118 total) that ignored me or just said ‘Yeah’ and walked away? Chances are they weren’t worth my time trying to get to know them anyway, maybe they were having the worst day of their life. Or maybe they just didn’t have anything to say. No harm, no foul. 

The amount of people that were even remotely ‘weirded out’ by me I could probably count on one hand

**3. Quick on the Draw:** Also reinforced, socially awkward, whatever, someone paints themselves to be, they will never come off that way if they start a conversation- no, even just acknowledge someone- within the first three seconds that they are near them. This is a sign of assertiveness, of confidence

Waiting not only rifles every excuse a person can think of not to say anything through their head, and all the other nonsense people tell themselves.

The trick is acting so fast that the mind doesn’t have time to tell the body all the reasons it shouldn’t be doing this.

**4. The Lonely Socialites:** The biggest surprise to me was not anything that I learned through any of the interactions

It was a refreshing feeling to discover that becoming more social and personable was not something that only I was interested in, can relate to. A lot of these people, to me, seemed like socially active individuals, too- they just wait for someone else to make the first move. Be that someone else.

**5. Everyone and Their Brother:** 

Ultimately, is to talk to everyone. I can’t state the importance of this enough. Through chatting up random people I had a 2-hour conversation at a bar about life, the universe, and everything in between. I found out about a somewhat-secret series of acoustic shows hosted by a small local blogger in my city, and also became pretty good friends with a neighbor in my apartment complex during this experiment. 

Talking to everyone will make you happier, get you more friends, get you more dates, get you a better job, and make you see that the people of this world are inherently good.

And because really
--

To anyone that wishes they were more social- I highly recommend doing something like this. Keep data, and that momentum eventually turns into a habit.

**TL;DR:** Do shit you are interested in, you're not alone, talk to *everyone.*

When you meet a guy or group of guys for the first time, they'll just think you don't like them or have no interest in talking to them.  Also, the energy shouldn't be initially focused on them, but on the situation you're in.  

Start talking to them like you know them

So

-------------------
ME: [grinning] You ready to crush this or what?

HIM: [noticing me for the first time] Ha

ME: Yeah I haven't slept in 22 hours

HIM: [feeling more at ease] Yeah same here man

[laughs]

ME: [extending my hand

HIM: [shaking my hand] Rob.

ME: Hey did you study the handouts he gave us?  I'm screwed if they're on the test.
_______________

Notice how I began talking to him like he was already a buddy of mine, not in any kind of serious way.  I also made it clear that I had no agenda-- not even to make a friend.  I was just looking to shoot the shit before taking a test.  Only after some back-and-forth did I introduce myself, and I did so with an attitude of  ""hmm, you seem cool, what's up?""--without actually saying that.  And I did introduce myself fairly quickly.  There's no need to drag a conversation on and on before you introduce yourself.  Do whatever feels natural.

Notice also that I went right back to our conversation after I introduced myself.  Don't fall into the trap of interviewing them all at once

I also began the conversation happy and high-energy.  I was grinning, even with someone you do know.

Finally,"" then that person is AN ASSHOLE.  There is nothing weird about talking to the people in your immediate vicinity.  This is a reflection of their own social incompetency, *not yours*.  

You have to get rid of this mindset that ""I'm talking to this guy to make him like me.""  You are talking to this guy to see if you get along *with each other*.  If you don't--that's fine.  Just move on to the next person.  A solid 75% of the people you meet are not going to connect with you very well.  That's just the way it is.  Don't sweat it and certainly don't take it personally.  

When you guys are getting ready to go your separate ways (i.e. the test is over), this will often feel a little awkward but it is imperative that you do this if you want to continue the conversation.  If you know you're going to see them again (i.e. you're in the same class), you can sometimes wait and just say ""Good to meet you man I'll see you on Monday.""  Otherwise, say ""Hey it was great to meet you man, we should hang out sometime.""  See how they respond to this.  They may well suggest that you exchange numbers, in which case you exchange numbers.  Or they might be a little shy and afraid to suggest that you exchange numbers and they might just say ""yeah we should man.""  So just say ""alright why don't you give me your number and I'll text you.""  

Once you get their number,"" or the like.  Then you ACTUALLY HAVE TO TEXT THEM.  Do not expect them to text you even if they asked for your number.  Most people will forget about you very quickly because they have lives going on.  You will almost always have to make the first effort.  You can text them anytime from a couple days later to a couple weeks later.  If you sit on a number for more than a couple weeks, however, there is very little chance that they will remember you and it can even come off a little weird that you still remember them weeks later.  Don't procrastinate too long.

It's much better to first invite them to a group activity if possible.  A sports game, and them around you.  If you find at this point that you don't really like them or feel good around them, then you are under no obligation to text them again.  If you do like them, invite them to another activity or just to hang out, get food, watch TV or whatever.  The activities can become more and more casual as you get familiar with them.  After you've invited them out two or three times, they should start asking you to hang out, I would stop texting them until they text you.  Remember a relationship is two-sided and they must put in their effort.  You can make the initial contact but eventually it has to become a joint effort.

It's pretty much smooth sailing from here on out.  As long as you open yourself up and spend time with them (remember that--openness and time) you will become increasingly better friends.  

A couple last pointers:

1) Who you are is always good enough.  If you have to be someone you're not to get them to like you

2) Don't settle ever.  You deserve friends who like and respect you.  If you have a friend who likes hanging out with you but doesn't respect you (i.e. always puts you down, call him out on it.  If he keeps doing it, then cut him out of your life.  He's not worth it.

3) Having friends is supposed to be fun.  If a friend stresses you out more than he makes you happy

So we were window shopping and she was trying out some dresses. We were having a lot of fun. Then she suddenly decides that she likes a dress and she must buy it.

I don't know why but she assumed that I was gonna pay for her dress so she puts the dress in the basket and starts looking at other dresses.

Some background about me. I am a 20 year old sophomore at an American college. I have spent the past two decades of my life having awkward conversations with people and being a complete introvert. I spent my entire freshman year lying on my bunk bed watching TV shows and never going to class (or for that matter, and I would always think the worst of human intentions.     
  
I stumbled upon this sub-reddit by pure chance. And what a happy accident it was. As a started browsing through it

1. I have become a very

2. Two girls have asked me out in this 30 day period. And let me assure you

3. I have made dinner conversations at home fun. Some background on this. My family is one of those dysfunctional families you see at a restaurant

4. I have become a more patient, happy person. I radiate happiness, if you will. I try to make everyone around me happy as well. And doing this in turn makes me even happier!

How did I achieve all of this? What posts and experiences did I read that helped me change. I will summarize what I specifically did to achieve this. For me

There is no other virtue as powerful and life-changing than **confidence**. Sadly enough, to be precise), and smile. And talk. And engage. But most importantly, amuse myself. And you know what, for a significant part of this process, **I faked it**. I faked being confident. I faked being interested. I faked it all -- until I actually started exuding confidence! Until I actually became confident! [This Ted Talks video on powerful body language] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc&amp;amp;amp;noredirect=1) Her thoughts on powerful body language are indeed helpful, but what was most instrumental was one part from her speech - **""Fake it till you make it""**. Again

Every morning

I walk with a straight, like I own the place. I always try to radiate happiness and bring a positive attitude to any conversation I have. I never look at the ground when I feel awkward. If I'm feeling uncomfortable, I lose the awkwardness and be awesome instead. I fake it until I make it. The old me would look at his phone whenever he's in a group of people and feeling out of place. The new me will never do this. He will try to add **small bits** to the conversation until he feels comfortable and can converse properly.

Every morning when I wake up, you cannot do the ""fake till you make it"" technique unless you **love yourself**. Unless you're proud of yourself. I really do love the new me. This confidence and 'fake till you make it' thing has truly changed my life in so many ways I cannot express. I don't know how helpful this post is, but I felt I needed to say thanks to this community. Everything I have said in the post is something I have read on this very sub-reddit. To be honest, most of the things I have read here are things I already knew but never had a chance to really think and introspect about them - for e.g., a simple mantra like ""Be Yourself"" is so deep that it's been passed around since ages, but we never think about what it means. It means to love yourself, to not be afraid of what you want to say

In short -- all my life I was a fucked up introverted teenager from a dysfunctional family who couldn't have a conversation with another human being and was scared of intimacy, you can do this too. All you need to is believe in yourself and love yourself for who you are. Thank you for reading!

Edit: adding some very important stuff about eye contact.  
One point I did not seem to stress enough was making **eye contact**. It engages people so much! Without it, that's a bit creepy. Shift of your gaze from time to time, but for about 70% of the conversation you should be maintaining eye contact. I usually look at the left eye.  Eye contact WILL make the person you are talking to way **more interested** in having a conversation with you, and it does show a lot of confidence!",,False,,1356762050.0,t3_15lzss

Let me start off by saying that I don't think I fit the stereotypical 'forever-alone' persona (whatever that may be?). I'm well-educated (graduate degree). I'm kind and caring. I pay close attention to the clothes I wear and I try to always look my best. I'm friendly, this isn't a rant about the friend-zone. It's more of a rant about .. not having a solid and meaningful relationship (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) with another human being.

I try to remain optimistic and I go out of my way to change this.. but I have had NO luck so far.

I brought one of my friends along to go see them. And met up with others later on. I wasn't expecting much other than some good music. I saw this really beautiful girl standing next to me. Normally I don't say anything to anyone. But I started up a conversation with her. I started talking to her about the band, I asked her if she'd like to dance again when the Stars start playing. She said told me she really wanted to and I asked her for her number so we could find each other again.

She put: ""Hot girl from concert ;)"" in my contacts. Immediately I texted her saying: ""Hey

We had a good laugh and said we'd meet up after. At this point I was so pumped I couldn't believe I got a girls phone number. Thats never happened to me before. I was super excited. After hanging out with my friends for a while

She texted me and told me to hold up my phone so she could find me. We met up and she brought me over to her friends and introduced me. We spent most of the songs dancing. I had the confidence to take her hand and twirl her around a few times she was loving it and so was I. Then a slow song came on and I was really really really wanting to hold her hand. It was practically screaming in my mind. I didn't. So we danced a bit more and then another slow song came on. I thought to myself: ""Fuck it

We spent the rest of the concert dancing and holding hands. I've never held a girls hand before. Hell

_______ 
Why do we like people?
	-If they are similar to us
		-Both personality and physical characteristics
	-Competence
		-People who can function well/efficiently are more appealing
		-People who can function too well we hold a grudge against. we hate perfect people. 

Complimentary Needs -‘opposites’
	opposites tend to attract in the short run. However in the long run
		-except for ‘complimentary needs’
			-one person is very social
			-one is a slob

Niceness - we like others who are nice to us
	-Best tactic? - Smile at people (with teeth helps)
					-promotes trustworthiness
	-People who own pets we assume are nice and trustworthy

	-Reciprocal liking - we like people proportionately to how they like us
		-Your new friend has an enemy? They are now your enemy as well. 
		-Person didn’t smile back at you? You tend to like them less. 

Proximity
	-Time and distance
		-Closer in either makes us like people more
			‘Absence makes the heart grow fonder’… well it also makes the heart look elsewhere too… sorry bout it. 
			-Skype solves some of the problems of a long distance relationship
	-Simple presence is very powerful w/ attraction

Flattery
	-Needs to come across as believable. 
		-If it does
		-If its not real
			-People are almost a big a sucker for genuiness as they are for flattery. 
			-Works for kiss-asses as well




Biggest predictor of attraction?
	-Physical attractiveness
		-When we view someone who is attractive
		-When we view someone as unattractive, pessimist etc. 
		-In america

Phenethylamine: Neurotransmitter associated with love. “In love”
	-Short term

Endorphins: ‘Love you’
	-Long term love, produces a sense of balance.

When a long term relationship works, you produce Endorphins: You feel safe, comfortable, good. Less sexual, more affectionate. You can see the person as they are. 

Best way to view a relationship ending
	-“we had a good run”
easier to find Phenethylamines again.

Loneliness
	-A desire to feel close to ANYone. Sometimes it can be specific

When someone is depressed, unattractive.	negative feedback loop, as then it is harder to get people to like you

Hoplessness runs along with it as well. 

Despair, hopelessness

&gt;**BE** the person you want to be.

In other words, is the underlying principle of ""fake it until you make it"" but I often think the message/purpose of that phrase is lost on people. Hell, it was lost on me for 28 years! ""Fake it until you make it"" also implies that you have to make some radical change and it assumes you already *know* how to act the way you want. This isn't the case and we've heard it all before: gradual and sustained changes are far more effective than a radical change that doesn't take root. 

Whenever I'm interacting with people now, I'll take a deep breath and try to engage the conversation fully (I'm not always successful, but I have improved a lot!). Take every situation and use it as an opportunity. 

So where does this leave us? Well

1. Take every opportunity to practice doing what the person you want to be would do. 

2. Recognize that making positive changes takes time. You don't have to change over night. We're all ""works in progress"", for others (like myself) it takes practice. A lot of practice. 

3. Drop the ego. If you're afraid that if you do this you'll turn into this shallow person with a false-identity and fake personality

4. If you use every interaction as an opportunity

Hope this helps.

3. Reddit. There's a lot of self-help subreddits that helped me. /r/getmotivated, /r/dating_advice. Over the years I've seen so many success stories from people who have come such a long way. It really shows you that changing yourself is possible. 

4. I learned to dance. This is like a booster shot of liquid self-esteem. When you're able to just flail your arms and shake your booty without a care in the world as to what other people think about it. It's really freeing. 

So in the last two years, and I've never been happier. It's fucking hard work, but omg is it worth it. 

Things I do to practice. 

- Look people in the eye when I talk to them. Always terrifying to me before

- Smile. It's cliché

- Talk to All The People! Make small talk

- Allow yourself to love yourself. Say supportive and positive things in your mind, and things like that. [Self Fulfilling Prophecies work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) (Just don't become arrogant, you will if you take it too far.)

- Start liking people more. I used think I hated people. But I think that was just my brain making excuses because it was afraid of them. I saw a quote from Niel Gaiman that really resonated with me.

1359273526.0,17d0lu,How I transformed myself (and how you can too!) [warning: long],earthdrop,354,46,43,"Here is my story:

Back before my transformation, but I gave them nothing to work with and they lost interest. When someone said hello, I murmured and looked down at the ground. It was impossible to make friends that way. It sucked.

Since then, and now I make friends very easily.

How did I accomplish this amazing feat

Fake it ‘til you make it.

If you’re anything like I was, it all boils down to this: pretend that you’re confident and pretend that you don’t care about what other people think. Just pretend. You probably do care about what people think, but pretend that you don’t. Act as if you have complete confidence in yourself and your abilities, even if you feel the opposite. **It will do wonders for you**.

Here is what I did:

First, on my commute to school, I looked people in the eye and had a slight smile on my face. I didn’t feel like smiling at all, but I faked it. I was scared of how those strangers would judge me, but I pretended that I didn’t care. I felt awkward inside, but I looked incredibly confident outside. Some looked back and smiled, most looked sheepishly at the ground. Day by day, I barely had to pretend at all. It became easy.

I felt great, but I pretended that I didn’t. I also started chatting with people I didn’t really know. For example, if I saw someone wearing cool headphones or a new jacket, I made a comment. It’s amazing how little it takes to start a conversation! I quickly learned that **it didn't matter what I said as long as I said it with absolute confidence**. I was worried about what these people thought of me, *but they didn’t know that*. To them, it looked like I was in complete control. 

I also decided to try my FITYMI technique in public. I did little things at first, I asked them what games they liked. If someone had a large travel backpack on the bus, I asked them where they were going. I said anything that came to mind, but I said it with absolute confidence. I was amazed at how easy it was. 

In just two months of FITYMI, and flirting became fun. I even made friends with my bus driver and the regulars on my morning commute. Best of all, I felt great about myself.

Now, it becomes the norm. They say that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but what they don’t tell you is that habit takes over after mile 20. It becomes incredibly easy! If you have the courage to put yourself out there, the world will reward you for it.

1351639820.0,12d8r5,A practical guide to being more assertive...,,320,51,16,"Here is a practical guide that may help in becoming more assertive. I wrote it in simple steps. It's based on personal experience so take what you can from here:

1.) Start by not-giving-a-fuck what other people think: This is a very important step. It's the foundation to being more assertive. You necessarily have to start from here. Basically, who you're talking to, how you talk, and even how you move. If you feel people are looking or staring at you, disregard them. Completely. Once you feel that you really don't care what people are thinking of you in most social situations, you're ready for the next step. 

How do you know you've stopped caring? When you know that a person is judging you and you really don't give a damn...

2.) Learn to identify your true desires: This one is really hard. Many times
This is just our ego making us go in a self-defeating behavior. Although it's very important

One technique I use is the following: Has it ever happened to you that you find yourself in a social situation where you feel a hole in your stomach? Like a feeling that

Listen to it! Something isn't right because your desire is being denied by a social situation (usually someone). This is the moment to stop, your ready for the next step.

3.) Aknowledge and accept these desires: This part is very important. It's also kind of tricky. Why? Well, maybe you start seeing that your desires may not be so nice and may make you seem like not such a nice person after all...well, it's important to know that desires come from our evolutionary drives. This include our sexual and aggressive drives, which are common in EVERY HUMAN BEING. Now, that said, being assertive is not becoming a murder/rapist, just because your desires took you that way (this will be cleared up in the next step.) 

For now

You meet a very nice, although you manage to force a smile, you feel this hole in the stomach. Since you already know how to identify your desires, you know that you desire him out of the picture in order to have her. Suddenly, you feel bad about yourself. ""i'm not this type of douchebag!"" You say to yourself. So you repress your desire. THIS IS WRONG. 

What you should do, no judging. Once you find that you can do this, go to the next step.

4.) Consciously filter out which desires you will NOT act on: Remember when I said that accepting your desires as a part of you didn't mean allowing yourself to embark on a murder/rape rampage? Well

When you already know and assimilate your desire as your own, hurts others or is even against the law. Like I said, this is very personal. However, this is where you should let the rational, adult, intelligent and 'good person' you take a decision. 

One hugely important thing about this step is that you have to make a compromise with yourself: the consequences of acting in order to fulfill this desire are your SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. Here is where douchebags are seperated from great guys. Here is where boys are separated from men.

5.) Decide which desires YOU ARE going to act upon: This is the core of the process. This is the actual Assertiveness. When you know that your desire doesn't violate your principles

This is where you respond: ""I DESERVE WHAT I WANT AND NO ONE IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME. I WILL GET IT FOR MYSELF"". Really drill this into your head and heart. Do you want to be respected? Well, go to the next step.

6.) How?: This is where you have to consciously ask yourself

All you really have to do is to analyze what you have going for you and what you lack. Then

An example: ""I'm sick of my neighbor playing loud music at 2 am. I want my sleep. I'm decide that I'm going to talk to my neighbor so he stops playing loud music at 2 am. How? Well, I'll make sure that I'm completely calm (maybe I'll throw in some meditation). Then, I'll go ring his bell and very politely, but calmly and confidently (I absolutely know that I deserve to have my sleep at 2am), I will ask him to stop playing music at 2am"".

When planning your course of action

a form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person's rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one's rights or point of view.

This means that the 'politely' and 'confidently' elements of the example are very important. The difference between becoming an assertive gentleman or an agressive douche depends on this point. So yeah
After you know how you're going to proceed

7.) ACT: Don't think. Don't waste time. ACT. IF you find that your thoughts keep you from acting

8.) This final step, you deserved it. You didn't? Who cares. There are plenty of fish in the sea. DON'T GET ATTACHED.


Finally, one by one, you'll make this process automatic and instantaneous. In a short time, you'll see that protecting your rights is your nature, not being a doormat. I hope this helps.

Cheers!

What got me started is having a friend who reminded me that I'm awesome and Im worth being known.

And I progressed on my own from there. 

I started hugging or putting my hand on somebody's shoulder in the halls, didn't matter  but I did stop if they were bothered.  Now I'm not bothered at all by having people in my personal space.

Next I started saying hi to people and listening to conversations. Again it didn't matter who, and people with all sorts of interests.

Then I realized I had a thing for comedy

I soon realized that two huge parts of conversation are body language and vocal inflection.

So I started playing around with my facial expressions and voice in front of a mirror. Just seeing what kinds of emotions I could convey. 

I started moving around and practicing walking different ways. My best two tips here are act curious look at everything and walk as if nobody can stop you.

1. You need to learn to speak up. If you're socializing in a group, and would recommend it for anyone who has trouble being heard. I also joined Toastmasters, which is also helpful.

2. If you're at an event that's specifically designed for people to mingle and socialize, normal folks, they will let you into their circle, or at least they won't outright reject you. Don't over-think it.

3. Introduce yourself as soon as possible. It's a lot more awkward to introduce yourself to someone you've been sitting next to for 5+ minutes. If possible

4. If you're in a 3-way conversation

5. If you're in a group of 4-5 or more, or don't know/care about the topic), DON'T sit back and play on your phone! Make an effort to at least pretend to be interested and involved in the conversation. Simple things you can do to make sure people are still aware of your presence: lean forward, look at the person who's speaking, react to what he/she's saying by laughing or saying things like ""nice"" or ""awesome"", etc.

6. If you don't know a lot about the topic that's being discussed, and start a new topic. Example: ""do you guys know of any good ___ places in the area?"" (Lame example, I know, but these things tend to vary depending on the context.) If the conversation doesn't die down any time soon, try to engage yourself in it by asking questions. ""What is ___? How long have you been doing it?""

7. I've noticed that the person who always tends to dominate the conversation in groups (and who attracts and engages listeners) is the person who can tell the most interesting story. They've traveled widely, and they are eager and confident to share their stories with others. So you might start thinking about how you can add more cool and interesting experiences to your life, so that when you talk about yourself, other people will want to listen.

8. Don't ever go to an event telling yourself ""I need to make at least one new friend tonight."" Instead, the other person probably doesn't care, and two, you'd probably never see them again anyway.

In this thread, I want to try and communicate some of my ideas about Freshman year of college and hopefully help you guys out. If you need any more help whatsoever, I'm more than happy to answer any PMs!

*Mental Prep*

* Psych yourself up! You're entering the next phase of your life! Chances are, put on your favorite clothes, brush your teeth, and take a deep breath. **Looking your best will instill confidence!**

* If I were to choose the most important piece of advice in this thread it's that NO ONE will know or care who you were in high school. Why this is good for you and bad for cocky extroverts - Let's say we have a star varsity lacrosse starter who had a great high school experience: tons of friends, but rather an opportunity to make meaningful connections. Therefore, **leave your high school self back home**.

*Roommate(s) and Your Dorm Floor*

* First thing you'll do is obviously meet your roommate. **It does not matter whether or not you like your roommate**. In fact, and stay up till the AM watching stupid TV shows, get drunk, and go out on the town together. I smoked weed with him for the first time. I sexiled him the night I lost my virginity, and he cheered when he came back in the room. If you and your roommate are close, you'll probably form your own social circle and bring people in. On the other hand, you could have a bad roommate like my high school friend. He was rude, and never left the room. However

* After you meet your roommate, but I got fantastic results. I even made one of my best friends to date this way. The truth is that **people are nervous when it comes to move-in day. If you break the ice, you'll have a very easy time meeting new friends**. Even if you aren't a good conversationalist, they're more than happy to answer surface-level questions like ""where are you from?"" or ""what did you do in high school?"" or ""what's your major?"" From there, you can just probe their responses. Boom! Conversation!

* **Consider bringing alcohol

* After the first day

* **Study with your dorm floor**. Sit with your hallmates in lecture. They won't think it's weird. They want to get to know you. Even if you are terrified of groups

*Clubs

* This widely varies from school to school. Best way to go about this is to have someone else come with you

* **If you feel up to it, and parties all rolled into one convenient package. People say going Greek is like ""paying for your friends"". To that, I say fuck you. They will not like you because you pay them. That money is used for putting on fun events with your brothers/sisters, as well as community service. Brother/Sisterhoodhood always comes first in Greek organizations. Contrary to popular belief, you can be an introvert and join a solid fraternity. You just need to find the right one that you fit well with.

- Always relaxed
- Didn't seem like he had any negative motives against you
- People felt safe and relaxed around him
- Always had to say something

But an important level to his success was he had no insecurities. Nothing he was negative about himself. He was someone relaxing to be around and girls and guy loved him for that.


    The experiment:



I wanted to try my experiment at a different class. I entered a new class

*Will showing no insecurities, and always have a positive smile result me in success?*

Everyone I met I smiled and introduced myself, no matter how bad it was. Got a couple chuckles, even made a guy who was stone serious since the first day brake into a smile and laughter.

But yet everyone was still insecure as the first day, I just wanted to make her feel happier. But I enlisted so much insecurities she was unable to talk to me face to face.

Sometimes people joined their own groups and kinda left me alone at times

It was discouraging at first because this whole thing felt unnatural and odd


    Result  



People were more relaxed towards me all around. They were hesitant

But it did result in one girl being extremely excited to see me after class and a guy causally having a conversation with me just because I introduced myself earlier in class. You might think

I felt though I was nothing like my friend I mentioned before. What took me 3 months to achieve took him the first week of class.


    Problems encountered



Conversations were nearly impossible to start. I had no real reason to start a conversation and people were not willing to start anything themselves. They sure seemed to like me but it resulted in not many connections.

People had their own insecurities and as a result built up many walls against me. I wasn't able to break down the walls people put up like my friend I mentioned.

People didn't really stick with me

So yeah...

    Where to go from here..



New year, I still have a hard time getting to the deeper issues of having the trust with people. 

Making that good first impression and connection is still yet near impossible.

Also

**Small steps**  

Rome wasn't built in a day.  What is your goal?  I'm guessing it's something like ""have friends who treat me well and want to hang out with me"".  There are a lot of small steps between here and there
The steps may seem ludicrously small
And even if they never snowball, or a lot of nothing?  

**Non-neediness**  

I've heard it said that to receive a loan you have to convince the bank that you don't need the money.  The same thing occurs with social interactions: you can't seem needy or desperate for social interaction

This can be a problem

The antidote to this is self-validation.  Be happy with yourself and who you are.  By all means

Pay attention to the feedback you get from other people to adjust your behavior
The difference between the two is that one puts the focus on other people's behavior, which is far more controllable.  

**Cold approaches**  

Cold approaching refers to greeting somebody you've never met before and striking up a conversation with them.  The cool part about cold approaching is that literally *everybody you see* is a potential friend

The downside is that it can be a very intense experience
""Small steps"" help with this **a lot**

A good goal for the first day might be ""say 'hello' to a stranger"" or ""ask for the time"" if you need the pretext (there's nothing wrong if you do).  

Then, telling short stories, and asking open-ended questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ccn0p/four_tips_to_drastically_improve_your_socializing/).

1366811271.0,1d0bkv,[UPDATE] I'm so awkward and never know what to talk about when meeting new people,socialanxieties,240,36,21,"Hi everyone!

This is an update [to a post I made yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1cxskx/im_so_awkward_and_never_know_what_to_talk_about/)

Long story short, and I just didn't know what to talk about or how to act since it had been so long that I had actually been social or hung out with friends. Here is how the night went...


I was so anxious and nervous on the drive there

I tried to just focus on being positive and not letting this small hiccup bring me down

The first time seeing each other was her opening the passenger car door and coming in. I couldn't seem to find the area in the parking garage where you park (the first floor was all private parking) but she guided me to the public parking area on the second floor (yay!)

We started walking towards the city center, though, I realized that talking about things wasn't as hard as I originally thought it was. I brought up topics like talking about Sweden, how she likes it here, what she likes to do around the city...

She also asked me a few questions about my time here in the city (though she seemed almost as nervous as I was! I felt like that calmed my nerves a little...I wasn't alone in this!) and tried to answer as best as I could.

We found a cafe and ended up sitting down and drinking some coffee (I was surprised and glad in a way that this place was open so late because it gave us more to talk about... good drinks

I then sheepishly admitted that I'd been here for a while but hadn't made any friends because I just didn't know how to meet people and she suggested that we go out on Friday night so she can show me around the city and meet her friends!!! :)

After I heard that

An hour passed by and things started becoming much easier to talk about (she did have an alcoholic drink..not sure if it maybe opened her up more? She seemed more at ease and I was happy for that!)

With /u/manotm 's response, we grabbed some ice cream, and my nerves were slowly going away.

I used /u/handlesscombo and /u/undugg 's ""FORD"" acronym, her friends, what she wants to do after her year of au pairing, and just fun things to do around here. It turns out she met a lot of her friends online and that fact made me feel better in some way that I can't describe.

We ended up talking and hanging out for 3 hours and at the end of the night

She brought up meeting up on Friday again and that said she'd get in contact with me about it and we said our goodbyes.

I definitely think that getting over my initial nervousness was the hardest part. I still don't think I am a very sociable person


Anyways, thank you so much!! :)

Even if you wind up with ""What's your favorite kind of muffin?"" or ""Do you still have a VHS collection?"" whatever, that's totally amicable. Their response will quickly reignite the momentum. If it doesn't, you can just do it again, the most important thing is that you're just choosing a direction instead of being self-conscious/indecisive and letting the silence grow stronger by the second.

When I think of home I think of many things

* People that know me and vice-versa. 

Who is the person you can be yourself with no matter what you've done or who you are? Most will say their Mom, Sister,  best friend, etc. 

**Changing The Way You Feel When Out:**

For instance, my heart starts beating profusely, and I'd stumble and really be cautious of what my next words would be.

When I was growing up &amp; even now my Mom tells me stories about how I'd go up to anyone and just start a conversation out of nowhere with strangers. 

It got me thinking. Now, a more accurate answer; I was too young to care. But, it works the same. **I also didn't put people on a pedestal.** There were no rich or poor. When, I was younger, I only knew people. That's it. I put no one above me, all I saw were faces, mouths

So the moral and what you should take from that chunk of text; is to **remove people from pedestals.** 

Now

**The Home Effect:** 

Before I go on

If you remember from above

The person that I can talk to without feeling nervous, my flaws, and the things I'm good at. I have nothing to hide, so I don't have to prove myself in anyway.**

For some people, you don't have to hide or prove anything to anyone, because you know yourself.

So one the way you get that *security* feeling of your home while out and about, and what you're good at.** Even though they don't. Just **assume** they do, until the time comes that you want to tell them. Not that you ever have to, of course.

**Closing Thoughts:**

I'm sorry for the wall of text

Remember the next time you're out and feeling out of place:
  
* **Remove people from pedestals

* **Take risks and don't care, it's only 2 minutes and it's worth it! 

* **Assume people know you

I seem to be paralyzed by authority be it at the workplace or at school. I find myself thinking too much when conversing with such people, but I am not sure how. Conversely, I kick myself for not saying the things I ought to say.

Besides that, unable to express opinions of my own. Not because I don't want to disagree, but there's nothing that comes to mind besides the shallow and patronizing remarks. I end up nodding and smiling along which i hate myself for.

My thoughts seem to be all over the place. If I were to imagine a hypothetical exchange, and then suddenly executing everything at once. This is so bad that I am beginning to question my intelligence, logical reasoning skills and all.

I wonder if it that is the way it is.. Am I to accept that for who I am? My ambition is to work in the hospitality industry

Am I an introvert? I actually don't think so - I love having people around in those occasions where we have things to talk about. But my inability to socialize has forced me to re-assess that. Even with some of my closest friends, I have no problems becoming the livewire. I understand that one doesn't always has to keep the conversation going, but I cant help to feel that way. Having silence in the air suffocates me. But I can't hold a conversation well either.

I am not trying to be the guy that always one ups you at all, just want something to contribute when people are sitting around telling stories about their past...

Last night I was hanging out with two friends of mine (who happen to be going out, I was fully interested in our interactions. It was a wonderful change. However I did notice something, my entire basis for conversation was what was in front of me at that very moment, living in the present if you will. Talking about the person taking their shot, some random information regarding a cool billiards game I found online, discussing rules of the game, etc. We then went back to their apartment and were just kind of sitting around talking and I felt that I had absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation. I almost felt like a spectator. I'm sure some of you have had this experience, and then you get even MORE self conscious that you're not saying anything and it's just a big circle of one thing causing the other thing to get worse and just feels like a huge amount of pressure to break the silence with something amazing which adds even more pressure... (no idea how to deal with that...)

They were discussing bad bosses and jobs they've had in the past, funny stuff happening around them, etc.) and they both had really refined skills at telling stories. And it's not like they tell the same ones everyday, it was fairly obvious to me that they just were stringing together memories into really funny and interesting narratives that really engaged the listener. It was actually astounding to listen to them speak, it was glaringly obvious to me that they had improved exponentially at storytelling since the last time I saw them (which was about a month ago).

I don't know how to go about doing this... I know watching stand up is a good way of seeing how to put together a story in a way to keep it interesting

So, what is some advice in keeping up in these situations? 

I want to be clear, I feel really left out and like I don't belong when I can't even think of anything to say, and knowing even if I did I couldn't string it together to be an interesting tale (or even one that makes any sense half the time...)

I dunno, and I seem to hyperbolize everything as well... which I really tried to avoid here, but reading this I find that I am still not doing well in explaining myself.

I have no friends that are girls which I believe it is because I also basically fall in love with every girl I see and speak to. I don't want to but one of two things usually happen.
1) I'm so lonely I take any kind act as a sign of her liking me.
2) I think way too much and seen way too many movies so I come up with some stupid fantasy where the firl I'm talking to falls in love with me in a matter of seconds.

I know that both of those are extremely unfair to the girl but I don't act on them so it just tears me up inside.

In middle school I had no self control and I never thought before I acted and I must have asked out every girl at my school. Obviously they all said no. Then last Valentine's Day I got the courage to ask out a girl. Our school had carnations that a student could buy and send to another student so I just sent her ""Happy Valentine's Day"". When she came up to say thank you she gave me a hug and then I ask her. Her only response was that she was busy. I'm pretty optimistic so I thought ""maybe she is busy""

This took me **sooo** much courage and now I'm scared to talk to any girl now. I can't even have a conversation with my best friend's girlfriend because I'm too scared.

Well I'd like to start here by giving back what I can. Just some simple advice that may or may not help people. Its obvious advice

It's just the idea of persistence and not being down on yourself for not being where you feel you should be. If I learned anything, and then instantly be able to go out and talk to people better. So I would learn some new technique, go out to try it, chicken out and not do it, then feel horrible about myself because I felt like a failure.

but what I discovered is improving socially doesn't work that way. You don't get better by trying once or even five times. You have to persist and do it over and over again until you get better. Also

I guess my point is

Here are some tips that I can offer you who want to change:
___


* Let people love you as who you are

This helped me the most. If you loosen up, but will probably be more friendly than you used to be. Without doing this, I would've never gotten the friends I have now. I used to want to be something I'm not. I let myself be myself, and showed who I was to people. I let people love *me* not the person I *wanted to be*. Open up, and people will love you.

* Read about social skills

This helped me a ton too. Read the sidebar websites

* Society puts too much pressure into being socially active

It's completely OK to not have a girl/boyfriend. It's completely OK to be quiet and think. It's OK to be a hermit. But society seems to think something else. Society is stupid for this exact reason. But nobody ever got stronger for just floating with the stream. To get stronger

* Accept what you can't change

This was especially important for me. This was on a bathroom wall, then you are. If you can't change this, don't try. If you can, do.

* Try doing what's called ""social skydiving""

Talk to strangers. People who will never meet you again. People on buses, but no pain, no gain. Learn to accept the fact that you will be anxious about this. But also remember that you're doing this so that in the future, you won't be anxious when talking to non-strangers.

1362601808.0,19sohk,Some general advice on conversations and socializing,martinzky,158,18,11,"Many of you will probably know a lot

**Speak up and make sure that people hear you. Also try to speak clearly.** Often it is possible that people will don't respond to you simply because they didn't hear what you said. This happens more often than you think.

**Look people in the eyes and don't be afraid to keep eye contact.** It might be a bit nerve wrecking in the beginning

If you are a person like me who has a habit of not smiling that much, use them.

**Relax and imagine that everyone wants to be loved**. This may sound a bit ""hippy'ish"" but it might apply to you. I for instance am quite a paranoid guy who has a hard time trusting people, and they just want to have fun, and there's no reason why I shouldn't be a part of their life. Just because I've had bad friends in the past who screwed me over doesn't mean that no-one can be trusted...

**Speak with emotions, it will also make you more ""in the moment"" since emotional communication happens on more of an unconscious level compared to factual communication. Also, try to sound more emotional when speaking, if you're bored try to sound bored, if you're happy have some enthusiasm in your voice. 

**Live in the fucking present.** The past is dust. The future is dust. You can't change either. You have no reason to fear either because they don't exist. All that exist is what you can perceive right now this instance. If you want to make a change then you have to make that change now. Get in tune with the presence

**Do what makes you happy and don't let others dictate your thoughts.** Decide yourself what to think, coolest life that you possibly can live. 

These ideas are some that I've followed rigorously for the last couple of weeks

Hope some of this helped others like it's helped me over the last couple of months.

1362558491.0,19rlim,Confidence - How to boost your confidence that others see,charged_polarity,154,23,31,"**Confidence**

Lets start with the definition of Confidence by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence): 

&gt; ...described as a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective. Self-confidence is having confidence in oneself.

Self-Confidence means that whatever action or decision you take, you will come off as confident. This guide will not be focused on girl help/dating however girls are attracted to confidence. 

The other day in highschool I noticed 2 teenage boys and 1 girl talking. You could obviously tell that one of the boys was shy and not confident. He was slouching (sitting down) and when he was talking he had that tone in his voice that showed he was not confident in what he was saying. The other boy was however and the girl focused her attention to him (you could tell this by the way she was standing and always looking at him

One of the key steps to gaining confidence and being more social is to analyse social situations, **no one wants to talk to someone who is slouched over, looking sad.** I suggest fixing your posture if you think you are like him, with a hunched back. How do you do this? Your ears, shoulders, hips and ankles should all be perfectly aligned vertically. Stand in front of a mirror to practice this. (Of course the ankles don't apply when walking, but when standing still they do). 

Another key role in your posture is your face/head. If your back posture is perfect

**Your challenge:** Next time you go out

**TL;DR**

Making your posture good and head straight will make you appear more confident. As well as smiling and eye contact.",,t5_2r275,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/19rlim/confidence_how_to_boost_your_confidence_that/

Example: I'm with a couple lady friends (one of which I am with) I brought to a social event to have fun/meet people. A guy approaches us but snipes towards the girls and does not bother to make any small talk with me or acknowledge me.  Now, so I don't react at all, in fact, I could give a fuck less. And if it was in a club or bar scene and they were complete strangers, I wouldn't think twice about it because it happens all the time (these are the things you have to deal with once you get a gf, reddit, it's not all easy work).

But when you are in a social situation that is part of a community, especially considering the fact that you are interacting with people you know you will see again in the future, due to circumstance.

So next time your in a social situation, approach the entire group, chat everyone up, get to know their names, make sure to ask how everyone knows each other, and then, if there is a girl you like there

But you should show that you are the guy who is interested in talking to EVERYONE

**EDIT #2:** Pronouns are hard.

There are 2 distinct options here

* **(A) You could go the full-on confrontational approach.**
(This would work best with someone you've just met or have been introduced to.)

*i*) **Comfortably approach them and say

Simply saying 'Hi' is recognized as the best verbal suggestion of interest. One that exceeds any bad pick-up line in its intention (as most are vulgar/awkward/employ terrible rhetoric). You don't run the risk of offending them if they're modest and you don't run the risk of rejection if your attention isn't particularly wanted.

Eye contact, or sitting across from you on the bus, for more than a brief moment. Eye contact is powerful. It'll take a bit of practice to manage it well, especially if you're already juggling your own insecurities.

*ii*) **Employ casual body language and read theirs as the conversation progresses.**

In fact

&gt;Observing in context is key to understanding body language. Pay special attention to CHANGES in body language rather than the body language itself. Don't isolate yourself by constantly examining [it] when interacting with people. Otherwise

* **(B) You can make your interest known from the passive and comforting safety of long-term courting.**
(This would work best if you're not one to opt for the confrontational approach

*i*) **Treat them foremostly as a person; a friend— rather than as romantic interest.**

Becoming friends first is an advantage of getting to know them in a casual

*ii*) **Afterwards

Reluctance or ambivalence won't serve you well at this point. But hopefully you'll understand them well enough to make the right call.

 I have had an endless streak of crushes that I have fallen in love with. Even though they respect me and enjoy my company

Recently I tried to escalate one of my crushes into a romance, one way or another. This rejection (you're creepy, don't rape me) was a blessing for me. Not only did I rid myself of a one-sided, parasitic relationship, it was also an emotionally volatile enough experience to be a catalyst for extreme change in my life.

  In the past week, and I have been applying the general theory of body language into my every day interactions.

I took over a new workplace yesterday

-Framing the theme of your conversation (ex. Positive, Flirty, Informational). Stick to a social frame so your partner can feel comfortable as opposed to trying to awkwardly navigate a socially ambiguous interaction. Make sure your intentions are understood.

-Indicators of Interest (IoIs) and rewarding partners for giving them to you. For example, they will stop flirting to protect their ego.

-Stopping unwanted emotions from coloring your interaction. Just a simple STOP with your mental voice is effective at clearing your head. I've cleared anxiety

I've found it very helpful to keep a list of things that I can do that are outside my comfort zone - that way, whether it's just a way to get out of the house, so hopefully this is helpful for some.

First, the *s are things I've never done before!

* *Call up some old acquaintances and organize a pub night.
* *Dance classes. (Not until September for me.  Scary.)
* *Improv/acting classes. (Not until September.  Scary.)
* *Rock climbing for some alternative exercise.  Cheap for students! (Not until September.)
* *Take up swimming as an alternative to running as exercise. 
* *Try to learn to play squash.
* *Go to a pub by myself on some theme/music/social night.  There's a nerdy/gaming night at a nearby pub in my town.
* *Attend a couple meetup groups/events.  
* *Go to karaoke.
* *Volunteer somewhere.
* *Go on a hiking trip (perhaps several-day) with a group.
* *Travel somewhere by myself or with a friend. (Scary.)
* *Join a social soccer or other sports league.  Not too excited about this one.
* *Host a social event/night at my house.
* Ask any girl who I've just met on a date.
* Use part time work as an opportunity to talk with people.
* Keep up with current friends as much as possible.
* Call up some old acquinatances - not people who are already friends - for a movie. Super low pressure.


Here are some suggestions for other people. I've either done them

* Take singing lessons.  It's a really good way to get used to your own voice, and being confident.  Even though it's a solitary activity, singing is often really tough for shy and awkward people, and I think getting decent at it can give a fair bit of confidence.
* Be an extra for some theater production.  I might do this one too if the chance pops up.
* Go donate some blood.  Not too social
* Join a toastmasters group if there's a good one in your area.  
* Go skating/learn to skate
* See a musical or theater production.  Ideally
* See some musical performances or concerts.  Check out your local orchestra
* Go shopping and try to have fun with it.  Invite a friend if you can.
* Learn some sort of board or cardgame, so I have no specific ideas.
* Talk to strangers when out and about.  It's tough

I've always considered myself a really good listener.  After all

It's been slowly dawning on me.  When I'm in groups of people, but rarely my heart.  All I'm ever thinking about is what to say next so I don't ""look stupid"", and while I'm thinking about that, the conversation has moved on, but sometimes I say what my mind anyway and interrupt the flow of the conversation.

Or I'll listen to the words, and why can't I be more like them, and how does it come so easy to them, and why do I even bother participating in these things in the first place.

Or when I'm with a person or group of people

I can now say that even though I'm one of the quietest people I know

Fortunately, all I've been trying to change is just how I BE with people.  I've been trying to give them 100% of my attention, not just with my brain, but my heart as well.

I think my social anxiety is inherently selfish -- by which I mean, it seems to me that being that selfish around people usually just isn't appropriate.

People want to know that they are cared about. Once they sense this from you, too.  Good listening can help take so much stress out of interacting with people.

___

As an introvert, by yourself. At the same time, you still crave face-to-face social interactions, and you would love to spend your weekend nights in great company.

Introverts love to be social, just right. If that’s what you want, then read on to discover 4 of my best strategies that will get you ready to start living a great social life.

**How To Be More Social By Understanding Friendship Dynamics**

To optimize your time, and other don’t.

Before you start looking for new friends

Some people have a small circle of close friends and a wider circle of casual friendships, expect them to act according to their current friendship life: if they have enough close friends already, then they’ll only be open to casual friendships.

**Set Weekly and Monthly Social Rituals**

As we said at the start

I suggest that you start by setting a weekly reminder in your calendar that reminds you to take one hour of your time and follow up, and call whoever you want to stay in touch with, or whoever you have something to say to. This makes sure that you don’t neglect people and cause them to just forget about you.

With that, you get to meet new people.

These kinds of regular commitments will bring you peace of mind because you realize realizing that, as long as you stick to your rituals, you don’t have to worry about it.

**Focus On Groups Of Friends

Another trick you can use to be more social, making plans, and inviting people. But when you make friends, introduce them to each other and form groups of friends, it’s a different world.
Within a group of friends, so you don’t have to contact everybody to make something happen. And you don’t get to feel desperate because your friends will seek out the group to go out and be social on the weekends, automatically.

To benefit from the group-effect

Some of my friends have strong personalities. They make sure they are heard whether what they say pertains to everyone or not. There were times when I would say something, they don't ignore you out of spite. It's all about timing. It's almost impossible to listen to two people coherently at the same time, and you sure as hell won't be able to pay attention to both. What generally happens is that people default to listening to the dominant speaker or the flow of conversation of the group. In some cases, someone will listen to what you're saying instead of the head.

Speaking your opinion is all about timing. When the conversation dies down slightly

It may seem like a cop-out way to socialize in a group to some

I hope this helps.

I'll skip the auto-biography of how I changed as a person and go straight to what I wish I knew a couple of years ago. 

**1: Focus on other people around you, gestures and listen to their voice. Absorb the hell out of what they are trying to convey. Understand them. Then,  just respond naturally without trying. 

Communication is a two way street (I know, and probably many others, is to focus to heavily on what we ourselves are doing in the present moment (e.g. ""am I sitting right?"", ""am I enthusiastic enough?"", ""what do I do with my hands?!""). We do this by using many of the social skills we've learned from sites such as this. However, this distracts us from actually communicating. It fills up our head with pointless thoughts that isn't helping us socially at all because it leads us to focusing on ourselves, not the other person. So that's the first thing I wish I knew the most: Focus on what's happening around you. Respond naturally to information around you

Likewise, and they are right infront of us, so take advantage of this because it will make communicating a whole lot easier.

**2: Don't dwell.** If you said something wrong two seconds ago that sounded silly, so think pro-actively and don't let stupid memories influence you to the point where it hinders your progress. 

**3: Laugh at yourself and don't take things to seriously**. Life is short, people are starving to death somewhere in the world right now, your forefathers had to kill animals to eat and live and run without fancy shoes, the universe is ridicolously big and might one day implode in on itself, the earth is slowly dying, the world will go on without you.. These are reasons why we shouldn't take ourself so seriously, I personally don't matter in the big picture. So why not laugh if we fall on our arse, if we did something weird? Enjoy the moment and share it with others. Never take yourself seriously (ofc there's no need to bully yourself

**4: Be honest and speak your mind**. Don't waste time being shy and quiet if you want yo become better socially. Let the world know what you think and you'll find that you're a bit happier knowing that you've spoken your mind. Honestly

**5: Don't be afraid to fail**. This is also a cliche but its priceless. Give it everything, Steve Jobs and other inspiring people who weren't afraid to get back up after falling down. So don't worry that everything might not go  well every time in social situations, you'll get another chance. 

**6: Nobody's perfect**. Everybody has their worries, we all have them. 

**7: Stop thinking that you know what people are thinking, fat, etc. But, this was people I was passing in the street who maybe just looked in my direction. I had no way of knowing what they were thinking, but I projected my stupid negative self-beliefs onto them and it ruined my day and my interactions with other people. So stop speculating and guessing what other people my think of you, you don't know, and at the end of the day you ultimately decide how to think of yourself. Project good self-beliefs if you are gonna project it at all. 

**8: Give of yourself** Churchill said: ""You make a living by what you get; you make a life by what you give."" This is true in social situations too. Don't be afraid to giving someone a compliment, and validating them. If you do this to others, before you know it they'll do it to you and you'll have a richer life in many ways.",,False,,t5_2r275,,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1fkkkd/my_game_changers/

Having confidence is what really separates you from most guys. There is a reason why so called ""assholes"" get a lot of women, they know that the men are sexually interested in them and they know that they are not scared and they are confident with their intentions. This means that they don't beat around the bush, nor do they spend much time being the girl's friend. They are direct with the girl and they are usually not too insecure.

You take a seat a table

There are certain ways you can go about this. You can go with the passive route
Hey
The passive route can be many things
Now let's look at the more direct route.

Now if the girl was sitting down I personally would just go and sit down at the table first then stick to introductions later

Hey. I saw you

This is really clean and easy, you're direct with telling her you find her attractive, and you're conveying confidence. If you're scared of this approach because of rejection, then you should really think about how exactly that affects you. There is not magical way to not get rejected, there is no guaranteed way a girl will not reject you, but that is perfectly fine because there are millions of girls out there and just because one rejected you doesn't mean the next one will, you can choose to see a rejection however you want to see it, you just don't need to take it so hard on yourself. A lot of guys don't tend to be so direct with their intentions because they are scared of rejections

We men are suppose to be bold and confident, and we do whatever it takes to get that, it's just a matter of not being scared, easing up, and not taking it so seriously. This doesn't mean you be an asshole and treat women like crap. It just means you put yourself and your intentions in front of you and you take charge of your life. You can apply this concept to other parts of your life as well.

1369243579.0,1eugas,The Ultimate Power Of Personal &amp; Social Networking,xx_robzilla_xx,99,15,8,"This is a rough draft. Always appreciate any input.

The Ultimate Power Of Personal &amp; Social Networking

Picture your life as a tree. This tree is powerful. Full of branches with sub-branches stemming from it, isn't it? Networking is that exact concept. So much beauty to be found.

Many people have their core group of family and friends. Those people, and that is great! The thing is, when you're looking to grow and find new and exciting things in life, these aren't likely going to be the greatest source for that. Friends of friends/family, co-workers, as you branch out farther, are more likely to surprise you with things about them you never knew, as scary as it may be at times, new hobbies

Everytime you meet somebody new, but even dead ends can sometimes spring to life weeks/months/years later.

Here's a list of why networking is a very positive and rewarding thing:

1. Meet new and interesting people
2. You find out things about people you never knew before (""I never knew you liked kayaking!"")
3. You discover more things you like and realize you are ""finding yourself"" as well
4. You develop into a more interesting person with many sides to you
5. You have a lot more to talk about with others
6. Many surprising opportunities will spring from people and places that you never expected
7. You will be living a much more fruitful life and have the ability to make a much more powerful impact on the world
8. People will take notice and you will become more valuable in their eyes
9. A greater likelihood of all your dreams coming true
10. Your brain will be very pleased that it's growing

If that list doesn't appeal to you

Possible negatives (&amp; how to overcome them)

A. You don't trust strangers

True, but for any person who means to do harm to you, you have likely established relationships with many more that will jump at the opportunity to help protect you. Just play it smart and don't go jumping into stranger's cars, you should be fine. If you are in positive environments this is going to be a rarity.

B. You're afraid

The more you grow, to become more than what it already is. That would mean knocking over these obstacles that only exist in the mind (fear, anxiety, overthinking, negativity).

C. You might not like where these paths may lead.

Then you stop with that path. You now know what you do not like or want. It would be a good thing to determine why you didn't like it, discovering what you want and don't want. Sometimes, the reason you don't like something is because you associate it with a bad memory. Maybe it's time to find a newer, more positive outlook on the situation. Perception is everything!

D. People close to you may not like it

People can become uncomfortable with others changing that they cannot control. I think the more important thing to determine is why are they so uncomfortable? Are they genuinely looking out for your best interests

At the moment

Network everything! People, music, learning... the more the better! Go with what works and just enjoy discovering what you like and who you are becoming.

Here's a few tips for how to network successfully:

1. Be interested in them first. Not in a needy way

2. Study how to have deep and meaningful conversations with people. Surface level talk can get old very quickly. People will feel the desire to open up to you when you can successfully connect and empathize with them. Fortunately

3. Be aware and take note of threads. A thread is anything that you could pick up on that will take you down a different road that's usually got an association with the one you are on. For instance, look them up!

4. Do your best not to burn bridges. I remember many times feeling justified to burn bridges when I was wronged. Did I really need to tell them I'm done

5. Constantly search for things similar to those that you are interested in.

6. Always stay positive and down-to-earth.

7. Notice people's intentions. If they have a selfish agenda

Networking is your tree of life. You can prune it as you wish and grow exponentially in whichever direction you choose to focus on. Enjoy the journey

I don't think a girl like her would ever want to date a guy like me but she doesn't even want to make small talk. She's cool and attractive and I'm awkward and ugly so I can't really blame her.

I couldn't think of any interesting questions to ask her and I kept stumbling over my words and saying shit in a weird way. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong but it still all sounds awkward to me and probably to her too. I felt really uncomfortable and she looked uncomfortable too so I just backed off.

For the past 2 years I've been trying to be more social/talkative/get more friends, I just don't feel as fulfilled as I thought I would.

I observe people every day when they interact with each other, their other small interaction quirks, etc, and it *looks so fun!*

I did get to know (read: say hello
I got to know people a little bit deeper (read: chat about stuff other than our mutual studies).
I got to know people even beyond that (read: chatting with them about personal things

Sometimes it's fun to interact with people

I'm a 23 year old man with a strange job that involves close quarters with other guys my age. 10 of us in a room off and on for a couple of hours. That's all I the detail I feel I can provide at the moment.

""Jake"" and ""Alan"" are best friends who I've worked with on a couple of occasions. I dated Alan for a while, any comments I make start to get pointed reactions. Jokes suddenly aren't funny and ""Jake"" seems to play devil's advocate to everything I try and say. Others seem to be encouraged to do the same. ""Alan"" has resorted to talking to me like I'm an idiot. ""You know that's a joke, right?"" and ""You know that's not what __________ was about, right?"" turns into almost any interaction we have. He's got a new boyfriend, I thought things were good.

It all came to a head yesterday when ""Jake"" sent a group text from within the room to other people, give or take a few words.  ""Jake"" and I had a problem on a previous job engagement where he sent me a text that wasn't meant for me, but was discussing things I said. I saw my name on the text beside me, and I froze, but kept reading. It wasn't meant for my eyes, but it sure was stupid to text the phone next to mine.

My job requires a tremendous amount of continual focus - I wasn't able to continue so I left work. Came in the next day and talked to everyone in the room. I described that I had seen the text message and it had affected me enough to be unable to do my job. I explained that the person had previous issues with me before and how I had felt intimidated and hurt about the whole situation.

The reaction was less than satisfying and I think I made things worse. Aside from two people who reached out, but more humane than he has been these past few months.

I'm 23 years old male. And I had all this time unusually high voice. When all guys of my age had voice break I continued to sound the same. That was a huge hit. I was thinking something wrong with me, delayed puberty etc. I was laughed at so many times, this just crushed my confidence over time. And whenever I am confident, my voice is still very weak.

So this is how it began. But recently I was reading about how voice functioning and how it gets low in males and applied that to myself. I was pretty tall and my Adam's apple was pretty large also, very pleasing.

I was speaking falsetto this whole time! It just seems that some anxiety caused this or something.

But now I want to use my true voice and simply afraid to change it. Afraid of questions, strangers, anyone) I just can't start talking with it. I've tried many times. It seems like my voice cords aren't listening. Maybe I just can't relate this voice to myself? It's very deep, maybe I'm afraid to sound harsh or serious? I'm stuck. Reddit, can you help?

1362012041.0,19d434,Social Confidence and Open Mic Nights: My Experience ,MovesLikeAgger,93,17,12,"This is my first time posting in SocialSkills

First, when I make friends, I am fine talking to them and comfortably as well. I find the initial period of talking to someone extremely uncomfortable, and before have found myself compulsively lying in order to try to get the person to ""like"" me or find me interesting. This is especially prevalent when I have to speak to women and especially women I find attractive.

During a recent break-up, since to me I have always been ""faking"" confidence. I take the advice to walk with my head high and back straight and act it, which I do. Underneath, however, I am still cripplingly anxious.

I began (as part of my ""getting over her"" plan) to exercise more, crucially, start to attempt open mic nights. I have played guitar for 5 years but never to an audience. Needless to say my first attempt was dreadful, but I still got the polite applause. However, even though I had been sub-par, I felt the need to go back and try again. The next show I played I was far less nervous, and people stopped their conversations to listen to me. This was such a new experience for me

Ever since then I have been playing as many shows as I can. Yesterday I played to an audience of 80 people, congratulating me for having the ""balls"" to go up and play. The ""balls"" to go up on stage and play was something that most of these ""normal"" people would never do. When I thought about it, talking to new people or trying to talk to women was nothing, really, when compared to standing on stage and *singing* to these people. If I can open myself up enough to let them hear my voice and my songs, why can't I just chat to them? Now where before I had to force things and even lie, I now had a great way to open up to people. I even later that night tried and failed to chat up the barmaid. Even though it was a failure

I realise this has become a bit of a ramble. But I guess the point is, and wonder what else about myself people might like. I've been able to do things like the eye-contact challenges with no problem, and in general have felt far more comfortable around people.

Today she dropped the bomb on me that she was actually *""testing me""*. She gladly announced that I *""passed the test""* because I successfully solved her no longer existent problem. Obviously I didn't pass the test because I had done it out of blind luck. We had a short conversation correcting this. I don't even know why.

I need to make sure my intern know I'm not interested in him without being too harsh. So for the guys here

Here's the background:

I've been really cold to this kid because I thought he was a major suck up. He would endlessly compliment me

Obviously I thought he was the biggest suck up ever. 

Then the other interns told me that he wasn't a suck up

Yes, I spent most of my life with too little social life to develop any social skills. 

Anyway

Yes, really dumb. Now he follows me like a puppy. I'm not really sure how to get it through to him that I'm not interested in him at all without hurting his feelings and making things even more awkward at work. This sounds really cold but, I still need him to do his work and I don't have time to retrain another intern since I'm doing a 3-person job solo. 

So far I've:

1. Casually brought up office relationships and mentioned that I would never date a co-worker again. 

2. Mentioned I'm not attracted to younger guys.

3. Started using the phrase ""as your supervisor"" a lot no matter how power-trippy it sounds to remind him that I am his supervisor. 

4. Tried hooking him up with other girls.

5. Replied to every offer to hang out more with

Since he's not getting the hints, and this poor kid is seriously ruining his chances of getting hired since people notice and think he's ridiculous.

Cheesy as it sounds

I broke my ankle in March and couldn’t do any of the physical challenges I set for myself (more snowboarding, I figured if I could fight through the fear, this could turn out to be just as awesome.

**I set goals.** My commute had 4 segments: (1) bus TO then transfer for (2) train TO, doable goals. And they can build on each other! Once I got going, I often found myself talking to extra people at bus stops, at the stores I travel to, etc. so that I talk to way more than 4 strangers a day.

**I ""faked it until I made it.""** I made up this ""character"" that was ""cheerful, serious, scared, crippled and invisible."" It’s not actually a fake character so I wasn’t lying to anyone, just that it wasn’t my usual self. I found that as I talked to more people, I really became that ""cheerful, confident

**I make eye contact, they are not invisible to you. My mentality going into this is that I’m sharing a secret joke between me and the stranger. Sometimes this is enough to coax the stranger into initiating the conversation instead!

**I talk to everybody.** I didn’t just talk to the hot members of the opposite sex, the students, and within reasonable surroundings, the sketchier-looking people. There’s a saying that everybody is an expert in something that I don’t know about: I made it my mission to learn a little something from everyone. This meant training myself to really listen. Sometimes I start a conversation and just think, surprise me! And these strangers surprise me in the best ways possible.

Talking to everybody also helped me keep the hotties off the pedestal: I’m just talking to you like I talked to bus driver. ;)

I also learned how judgmental I was being. Particularly because of my injury, would wish me well or help me chase down a bus. Their kindness was amazing.

**Think of conversations as energy trades: you get what you give out.** If you give out positive energy and smiles

**I fail a lot.** Especially at the beginning. Oh man, crippled, cute girl"" who could hurt you about as much as a baby!) 

And sometimes I just get so cowed I can’t say anything. :(

You learn what you can from these failures. For instance

Sometimes the conversations just don’t last long and don’t go further than babbling about the weather. (Which to be fair, it’s not your fault, or the other person’s fault. You’ll have so many conversations, fault stops mattering, failure stops mattering. You’ve traded good vibes and that’s a net positive from saying nothing at all.

I've never really loved anyone, but I never meet people who I can connect with.  I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 18.  I'm 23 now, though that fact alone doesn't bother me.

I also realize that my expectations are absolutely unfair.  I feel like that in order to actually have a real relationship with someone, better.  Is it generally considered a good idea to date someone who's very, very different from you?

I also understand that I'm very subconsciously afraid of failure, even when my reasoning tells me no: that one girl is just too neurotic, and the next one too clingy?

The obvious solution is to just not bother with dating if I don't enjoy it, and I want to be loved.  Is there any point of dating someone with whom you could probably  never have a long-term relationship?  Someone's who's totally different from you and could never understand you?  Is there any point in dating when I don't feel capable of loving someone?  I feel like any relationship I have would be totally dishonest.

1333474260.0,rrg0f,Social Quicktips,SurprizFortuneCookie,75,9,14,"My humble quicktip list.  If you'd like to see something added

* Social Gatherings - I used to feel uncomfortable here, laid back in a chair and staired up at the stars or something, I found that people were drawn to me and wanted to talk to me. There is something mysterious about that person who seems to be perfectly content on his own while this huge party goes on around him that makes people want to get to know him.  This is effortless on your part.  Of course don't spend the whole party this way, if someone reaches out, give an appropriate response, they might take you around the party and introduce you to their friends or something.

* Introducing a New Friend to Your Friends - Often when I bring a new friend around my current friends, say, if he's sitting on one side of the room I sit on the other, with my old friends in between preferably, and I keep contact with my new friend.  I keep talking to him across the room about stuff we've done or make inside jokes or something, this gets my new friends interested and involved in the conversation and eventually, you don't need to say anything to keep the conversation flow between new friend and old friends running.  (I'll stop here for brevity)

* Building Social Skills - Very easy, at a store or park or whatever, and you see someone make eye contact with you, *smile* and say *hey how's it going*. The goal isn't to start a conversation (if you do, that's cool), it's just to build your confidence in your ability to connect to others. Often they will respond very well, it's not normal that strangers genuinely take an interest in them, ""Just Do It"".

* Passing Greetings - People often say ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" when they walk past each other. If you know their name,,False,,t5_2r275,False,,True

3. Common interest - (usually only NBA) ""How about them Lakers?"" Barring that
4. Activity/event where we met - ""Ready for the next volunteering event?""
5. Other experiences - When my friends sense the convo is starting to die

I guess it follows the FORD topics to an extent, but I know to develop close relationships I have to at least do that for the people who I want to get close to.

1375896785.0,1jw9im,How to deal with a very negative coworker?,lobsterpasta,80,16,29,"I share an office with a coworker who is the most negative person I have ever met. Every word that comes out of her mouth is a complaint or a nasty comment about a colleague. We work in the mental health field and our job is very stressful

Since I have to share a space with her (there is no option to switch offices as they want team-mates to be physically co-located), sometimes she corners me to let off steam and launches into diatribes about a particular coworker or situation. I'm very uncomfortable with it and she will say things like, ""haven't you noticed that so-and-so acts like this, and it's COMPLETELY inappropriate?"", or ""keep an eye out for so-and-so, she will stab you in the back"". She will complain *at* me about these issues for 10-15 minutes and it seems she expects me to agree with her or join in. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this as I try to keep relationships with colleagues pleasant and don't want to cause any drama at work. I'm significantly younger than her and nonconfrontational in the workplace, so I feel somewhat powerless to do anything but listen.

She's done this several times but yesterday was the breaking point. I was on my way out the door at the end of the day and she cornered me to complain about our third office-mate. She carried on about things he does to bother her, but overall a very sweet, helpful and pleasant guy. She was practically shouting at me about him, and our office door was partially open. The coworker she was complaining about walked in while she was saying these things and I have no doubt he heard some (if not all) of it while he was walking down the hall. He didn't show up for work today either. I feel horrible and I don't want him to think that I was an active participant in such a malicious conversation.

So moving onto an example of a place people do know and are familiar with.

I use public transport a lot. Works out cheaper for me and the other week I had a 70 minute bus ride ahead of me. Along the way the schoolkids got off and there was a girl who had briefly said hello and other pleasantries with me. After a bit of time

So knowing it could be seen as creepy, learning a lot about her and vice-versa. After a while one of the guys joined in (he described himself as an ""academic transient"" who would learn where he went and had a job travelling round the country). before you knew it, all 5 of us were talking about life, where we want to go, where we've been and then said our goodbyes when we left.

Seriously, sometimes you may get shot down or have a groan from someone but that's the worst they can do. Just say no. But remember, as they leave, chances are they'll think you're a good person - just trying to make conversation instead of being a face in a crowd.

We agree on almost everything, I feel like I'm the rational one. I'm always looking for a compromise. Trying to say there is no real disagreement, or we're both basically right. But he keeps insisting that I'm totally wrong, and this gets me frustrated and angry when I feel like I'm 100% factually right. And I feel like I have a pretty good track record, especially when I'm confident. If IDK or I'm wrong, I have no problem admitting it. But I do hate admitting I'm wrong, when I know I'm right, I feel like I'm trying to be the nice guy

Part of it is, and he always trys to strawman me, reductio ad absurdem, into a ridiculously extreme position, I keep denying. So I don't even know what each side is trying to prove or disprove. Its infuriatingly frustrating.

But the thing is, I have no desire to prove the other side wrong, I always feel like I'm the victim, that the price of peace is I have to admit to something I know is factually untrue. And apolgize for being right. Maybe thats a character flaw.  But I feel like the opposite, lying that black is white, 2+2=5 is no virtue. 

But if multiple people have expressed this opinion of me, and always looking to say we're actually both right. 

Even when I'm hitting on a beautiful girl, because I just have to correct every factual mistake. I'll be making a cringingly awkward attempt to flirt with a girl, she says one wrong word, and I just keep browbeating her till she admits I'm right. If its come to the point, where all my approaches on attractive girls that do miraculously lead to conversation, end up revolving around me lecturing them, then yeah maybe there is something wrong with me. 

And I don't feel humble since 99% of the time, and arguing so hard, when I calmly and patiently explained to them how the facts were on their side. And even gentlemanly offer a 50-50 compromise when wikipedia says its 100-0. 

Is the solution to just admit I'm wrong when I know I'm right?

Be like Stanley Hudson from the Office to Michael Scott? ""Thats your best idea yet"". 

I actually find I get along with people best, and thought of myself as a retard. And I had the humbleness that comes with that. I only started making something resembling friends, when I became a retard. But I guess now that I have a friend who treats me as an equal, my old arrogance has come back, and I have pride instead of retardedness.

I have all day off tomorrow, but I can't find any ways to meet people, or even just find people to have conversations with.  It seems like in general, people have no interest in talking to people they haven't already met... How do I start? One of the few things I haven't tried is going to a bar alone... The thought makes me nervous, and I'm not really convinced it's a good way to make some new friends.  I've posted ads on r/r4r and Craigslist, and never got a response.  I scour both every other day for people I could contact with little success, I'm not going to contact someone whose ad is nothing more than ""hey i want friend...""  I never got a response on any of the ads I did respond to.

There are no meetup.com groups for people my age since the University is such a central part of my city.  I tried a bunch of University clubs, and were incredibly cliquey.  There are a few others I plan to try when classes begin again, but I can't do that for months.

What am I supposed to do?  It's just so unbearably lonely all the time.  Whenever I'm at home, because I'm becoming so upset and worried over trying to succeed socially.

* [Challenge 1: Make eye contact and smile!](http://redd.it/1d4148) Spend a day or two simply making eye contact and smiling with strangers as you go about your day. You don't need to say anything

Just a quick back story
I'm 25 male.
7 month ago
It was a wake-up slap, I didn't have any passion except killing time playing video games.

I decided to change, picked up my guitar again, started contacting my friends again, lost a lot of weight, started reading material on social interaction (how to make friends, no more Mr nice guy, The game, updated my wardrobe.

For a while, I got nearly suicidal, really depressed, had two instance where I just couldn't go to work or outside. From this moment, I started playing video games, stop going to my improv class (felt out of place since I was 25 and every one else was 18), started eating more and went to a therapist.

The thing I wanted was just a small group of friends with similar interest (especially music, I can't manage to build a group of friends. I try to mix the people I know together,but it's always a night of social awkwardness. I also haven't made a single girl friend, and I don't know how to, since my ex forbade me to be friends with any female for 6 years.

I don't want to give up

I read all these success story of people who went from being Milhouse to become Van wilder, to understand the hard part, and maybe the tricks for getting through them.

Today I just came back from the recruitment fair at my university. Compared to where I was 5 years ago, whereas not long ago I would have been one of the awkward guys, overdressed and asking pointless questions while trying to get their resume on the pile. I didn't need to hand out any resumes because I made *real connections* there.

I used to have zero social skills. I'm sure lots of you can relate to my story. Maybe you weren't popular in elementary school, who was very suspicious of new friends and didn't like my old ones either. I got grounded for an entire year in grade 9, which was a big turning point as I fell into playing excessive amounts of online games. I got addicted to WoW late in high school which only further hindered my social development. University wasn't so great either. I spent first year in my room playing WoW. I spent second year mostly alone smoking weed.

By third year, and not a god-given gift. I started small, I practiced, I got better. I was still really, really weird. I kept trying anyway. 

If I could pick one single bit of wisdom that marked the turning point for me

Do you ever notice how nobody really talks to you? Even perfectly normal people sometimes have only 1 person or 2 people who talk to them on a regular basis. Lots of people have zero, and maybe the highlight of their day to meet a cool new person! Isn't it weird how we always expect the other person to take the initiative? Its silly isn't it? We feel fear about putting ourselves out there but actually for the other person it can make them really happy and we forget that.

Since then, or whatever, and thats why people don't talk to you. No, fuck no, its not. Its because people are all just as anxious as you! Nobody talks about it but there are enough anti anxiety prescriptions annually to cover half the Western population! 

Once you figure that out, where the more you succeed the better you feel and the better you feel the more you succeed. Creepy happens when you act interested but feel scared. Smooth is when you act interested and feel good!

Other than that, try and forge mutually beneficial relationships (which is just mutual selfishness, if you think about it).

Which brings me to today. Why is it that at the session today I landed personal contact details from every one of my target employers and a couple I didn't even plan for? It wasn't a manipulative formula or secret code. I just took initiative and I had a good time with them! Your damn right I put myself into conversations! I talked to them like real human beings

Super simple stuff. Hope that helps guys. Anybody can do it,False,,t5_2r275,1360219608.0,,,t3_181woo

Meeting new people when you are on your own is always difficult. When you are with a friend, one piece of advice would be to find one friend that you already have, whether they are from the same area as you or not, and get them to come out to a bar or café with you. Use them as a kind of friendship wing man. Approach some strangers in an indirect fashion, (for example commenting on something you overhear in their conversation.) The two of you will then be able to bounce off one another, taking turns to have input into the conversation. If it starts to run stale, ask the text book questions about where they are from
If you can't find a friend to help you with this, engage in a bit of small talk about where you are, what they do, interests and the like. As I said before, if they are someone who you could eventually be friends with, the natural chemistry should take over and things will flow, but don't be scared to push the conversation if it slows down a bit. Try and be a bit funny (even whipping out the most cringe worthy and bad jokes in a kind of ironic manner), (people like it when other people care about what's going on with them
At the end of the day, it's not the end of the world as you'll likely never see them again.

This isn't the only reason I can't stand the guy, and probably puts away a handle of Jameson a week by himself. He's always a bigger asshole once he starts drinking. Hank has only had one serious girlfriend, and every other girl he's ever slept with has only done so when massively drunk. Hank has been known to fondle drunk girls when they are blacked out/ passed out. He also has no concept of personal space or media etiquette. Case in point: both I and my partner have trouble following multiple conversations at once, so if we're trying to watch TV, we can't focus/ miss stuff if someone is talking. Hank knows this, and we've asked him not to talk during TV/movies multiple times, but he does so anyways. Hank also doesn't seem to care if you're trying to be snuggly or have a private conversation - he'll just walk up to you and start talking
Hank and I really don't get along. We have both expressed extreme distaste for one another, after I had been going out of my way to be polite and not provoke him. Then again, I did once say something along the lines of, ""Y'know, Hank, I've been unfair to you. I expected you to be capable of having a polite conversation without acting like a massive asshole. This was clearly an unfair expectation, and I'll try to let go of it in the future."" Everyone who's known him a long time agreed that would've massively chapped his ass - indeed
I am not really a very nice person deep down. I want to figure out what makes Hank tick; I want to discover and map every little cog, and then use that knowledge to completely destroy him psychologically. I want to leave him so utterly miserable with his existence he will never want to be around me again, and will move his bloodsucking ass out of my partner's house and perhaps become a contributing member of society for a change. I want to surgically remove whatever capacity for happiness he possesses and leave him even more pathetic and alone than he already is.

Here's the deal: I'm a 25 year old male with some rather severe anxiety disorders.  I was diagnosed with social anxiety 12+ years ago and have lived with varying degrees of it ever since, going out on dates etc.  Not surprisingly, 6 years of nonstop social isolation made my anxiety significantly worse and it built up to the extreme and constant level it's at now.

Now that you've got the history, seems *really* into me, is extremely eager to meet up ASAP.  She's my age, sweet, attractive, seems to share a lot of my interests.  I live about 30 minutes from her but have been making excuses for the past month as to why we can't hang out (she knows I have some anxiety, but I haven't admitted the full extent of it to her).  Except, this time I've actually planned to really meet her at some point, and I'm just as terrified as ever at the prospect of meeting up with this girl.

So here's the big, but since she was really upset about this and I felt awful and guilty, in my drunken/drugged stupor I promised her I'd make it up to her by meeting up with her today, pinky swear, no backing out etc etc.

So now it is the morning and I am sober and she is texting me wanting to know when we're going to meet up today and I am in full panic mode.  I can't make another excuse or just disappear (can I?) so I have no idea how I'm gonna make this work.

My biggest concerns:

1. Meeting up with her and having an anxiety attack...we're talking sweating, maybe even vomiting.  This thought terrifies me.

2. Conversation.  I'm *okay* with conversation via text, but over the phone or in real life, forget about it.  I foresee many awkward silences and me not know wtf to say, or being too afraid to say something, or saying something ridiculous and inappropriate instead.

3. She wants to meet up at her place.  She has 8 roommates.  So now I'm not just dealing with 1 person

4. Judging by her voicemails and e-mails

5. Speaking of spending the night...**sex**.  She probably wants that to happen.  She definitely wants *something* to happen.  I have a perfectly healthy libido, I was super excited about it on the way, but when I pulled into the parking lot dread washed over me and it was nonstop anxiety from then on.  I was nervous as hell when we met, tried to pretend I wasn't, and before I knew it she was all over me.  Long story short, she took off my pants and what should have been awesome was mind-numbingly embarrassing since my anxiety was so overwhelming that getting an erection was just about impossible.  I'd had one the entire day just thinking about it, but when it came time...""NOPE.""  I had zero problems with this in my first few relationships (before the anxiety got bad) but that was mostly because I was familiar with them and felt comfortable around them.  Although I like this girl, and until that happens I'm almost positive I won't be able to perform sexually in any way...and if the time comes

So far the only solutions I can think of for these 5 concerns are...**(1.)** Anti-anxiety meds...but those make me stupid, no idea. **(2.)** No idea **(3.)** Somehow convincing her to meet up somewhere else (?) **(4.)** Somehow convincing her to not stay the night (?) **(5.)** No idea

Can anyone offer any help?  Either help with the 5 things or just for this whole situation in general.  I'm not unintelligent

If somebody gives you a one-word answer
Instead
""What do you do for work?""  
""I'm unemployed.""  
""Sorry to hear that. I couldn't find a job
Pause to allow the other person to relate.  If not
""So where would you travel

The more you tell about yourself

**Free-associate:**  
Each new subject of the conversation can have nothing to do with the one before it.  Think of a stand-up comedian: they go from one unrelated joke to the next
If you're having trouble thinking of what to say next, but as long as you learn from those mistakes it shouldn't be a problem.

Moving in the fall of last year was fucking awesome. I met up with the guys I met during orientation, and generally had a good time for the first month or so. I had a (what I now see as) unhealthy relationship with a girl from back home that we were trying to work out long distance, and as things between her and I got worse (lessening communication, me putting in too much effort, insecurities on both our parts, etc.), this started to affect my social life. 

Halfway through last semester, and emotionally attached in the long distance relationship, and we had an emotionally draining breakup that left me depressed with no self-respect. I made the horrible mistake of basing all my happiness in her rather than in myself, and I'm still recovering from that. Now she's joining a sorority, in tons of clubs, and I can't help comparing myself to her. The saddest part of all is that she KNOWS how pathetic I am, I feel like the only reason she wants to be ""friends"" with me is because she feels guilty for dumping me the way she did. She even offered that I should room with one of her friends next year who goes to my school because I don't have a roommate selected, but it makes me so insecure in an area of my life that I never was before. Going into college I never expected it to end up this way. I used to always be confident in myself with whoever, but they live across campus and whenever I do I never feel wanted, I want the same sort of thing here. I hate feeling pathetic. 

**tl;dr I feel like I've missed a huge opportunity in my life to branch out in college, and going out and just making memories and having a good time. I'm super afraid that this semester is going to end up like the last one, with me feeling alone and pathetic. I can't handle going through that again.**

For the most part I have a small group of mostly guy friends I've known since high school (like three or four) and I'm very comfortable being  my socially unskilled self around them. I'm terrible at meeting and interacting with people outside of this group.

However, charming, and in control for that one night. 

Now, awkward, ect. and girls hardly notice me. But during these nights I could have my pick of any girl in the room. They will be seemingly unable to resist me and are down for ANYTHING I suggest, a complete 180 of what's normally the case.

For obvious reasons I'm trying to make these nights a more common occurrence by improving my terrible social skills. I've made zero progress and am unable to force myself into this socially awesome penguin mode. Probably because I am an introvert at heart and don't relish everyday interactions. I do notice that it only happens when I'm excited for some reason, before awesome stuff starts happening. Normally I'm slightly depressed, the normal amount for a teenager.

How To Have Deeper Conversations &amp; Relationships With Anyone

One of the greatest accomplishments over your lifetime will always be how well you connected with others and left a lasting impression with them. Yet for so many people it seems so difficult to connect or bond deeply with those that surround them. How do we break through the small talk and really get to know people for who they really are?

Let's quickly get past the opener. This, how's it going?"" or whatever variation, is going to be just fine. If you start out, they're likely to say something along the lines of ""Good, you?"" If they started it out, then good, either way we've arrived now to the same point. Quick note: if this is while passing by and you both are going seperate ways, when there is opportunity.

Break it down into four key components: topic, and content.

The topic is going to be what you wish to talk about. This should be something considered interesting to most people

Grounding is where you are supplying the reason you are going to talk about a certain topic. This is where you say a little bit of what you've got going on or are thinking about currently.

Transitioning is going to be the art of smoothly making that happen. This isn't all that difficult when you've got it planned out in advance

So

Movies: ""Great, have an easy follow-up such as ""Well what kind of movies do you usually like?""

Music: ""I'm doing good, what kind of music do you listen to?""

Stay interested and pay attention. Try to notice threads along the way that can help you either continue the conversation further or change the topic before it dies out. If their response for movies was ""I like watching movies derived from comic books like Spiderman, comic books, or even ask what is it about superheroes that fascinates them.  I think the deepest one is quite obviously that last choice.

That leads us to content. You want to dig deeper. You don't really need to know every single movie or band they like. What you want to do is get past these surface-level what's and get to the how's and, or how does it connect with their passionate side?"" These are the questions that will get them thinking, feeling... interested.

So there's quite the secret weapon right there: the how's and the why's. Now let's go over your five best topics that will have you connecting with people on a much deeper level (F.O.R.D. + W.)

F) Family - Should be obvious that most people have deep connections and feelings with their family. They usually love to talk about them.

Example: ""Doing alright

O) Occupation - Their job/career. This could also be about what they wish their career was as well.

Example: ""Doing great

R) Recreation - Their hobbies and things they do in their spare time.

Example: ""Good

D) Dreams - This could be interpreted in two ways: what they dream about when they sleep

Example: ""Great

Lastly

W) Week/Weekend - When you ask them what their plans are on their upcoming days off, and they should by now, they're likely to invite you to join them or hang out in the near future. This is also your opportunity to invite them to something. So here we go...

Example: ""Great

Ok

Very quickly

1. Positive body language
2. Be down-to-earth (no egos)
3. Have a strong voice
4. Be interested in them and what they have to say, or form
5. Let the conversation be a 50/50 thing
6. Be empathetic (the more they feel like you relate to them and the way they think
7. Keep things positive (this includes avoiding topics likely to get negative such as religion or politics)
8. Make sure the things you say about yourself are portraying good qualities about you
9. Have fun
10. Take note of their interest level. If they are in a rush

So here is my situation:
I´m 17 years old
I basically started becoming awkward with my discovery of the mighty MMORPG World of Warcraft, gave no fucks about my appearance and such. **I feel like this is a vital part, where I failed to learn  proper social skills**
Then we had a new boy in our class, we talked the same language, we had the identical humor and nearly everything fit, but due to the lack of social skills I was still awkward as fuck and depended on my buddy all the time. I did not try to expand my social circle and was very introverted when it came towards strangers and people I did not know well. **Found a buddy who got me back into life, but I was still awkward as fuck**
I than became a senior so I was no further in the same class as my buddy. Things started to get worse again, what I would now describe as a normal/good friendship. **Became a senior, no longer in the same class as my buddy, he made up a new social circle, I didn´t**

That´s a quick summary how things have gone so far so my problems at the moment are:

**- I feel inferior to everyone
I´m nearly the youngest person in my grade
When I´m around people i do not know well and my bro is with me he gets most of the recognition

**- I have a problem with finding new friends
I do not like the popular boys at our school
The people i made new friends with in the past two years are also befriended with my bro
People I have not befriended yet are either the popular kids

**- I feel not respected and insecure
I have almost no relationships to girls
I have a hard time getting to know people

**- Social Skills I lack:**
Leading proper conversations
Body language (My walking style looks really shitty
Telling stories
Being open towards strangers/ friends of friends
Grabbing and holding attention of a group
Giving value
I feel the pressure to be liked by everyone (this pressure seems to change every few days
→ If I do not get the reaction I want my self image starts

**Things I´m doing so far:**
Meditating
Playing football (remember I´m European! :D)
eating healthier
playing the guitar
reading lots of r/seduction and pick-up stuff
r/malefashionadvice
r/NoFap

**Things I´m failing trying to do:**
Smiling a lot
Being friendly to people

I am not expecting any enlightening tips of you guys, but I am still not feeling good about myself most of the time. I would say 2-3/10 days I feel awesome, but still I depend too much on external circumstances, like reactions by people towards my actions (laughing, showing interest etc.).

You'd be safe in describing me as your typical shy, I was usually practising martial arts, reading books, gaming, or learning about photography (my new hobby). None of these activities are very social, and I didn't get out much. To keep this short, my social skills aren't where I want them to be and my relationships with women are non-existent. 

I've resolved to begin taking steps now so that I'll have a chance to reinvent myself

* I'm working on my depression and self-esteem issues by reading [Intimate Connections](http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Connections-David-D-Burns/dp/0451148452).

* I'm working my social skills by reading the classic how-to guide [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671723650) and by reading [this website](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/). 

* I've decided to join a few clubs/student groups in college

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read other people's troubles and putting forth your thoughts. It really does mean something to those of us putting forth our issues. We may be pessimistic in receiving a solution to our problem


Now, social learning theory, self esteem, and a number of other things I've learned about through being a psychology student, one of the main things that correlates rather well with being good at something (or even just not terrible..) is thinking that you can do it, and knowing that you can do it. I have lost this optimism with regards to relating to others. 


There was a time when I thought that my lack of getting along with others


I feel lonely as fuck. Now, just waiting for me to reach out and be 'that awesome guy that I know you are', or 'that funny guy I knew in school'. But that's not going to happen. I have had the same sense of humour (I feel anyway...) since likely grade 9, and no one finds it funny. And yet I make the same jokes over and over and over, making others uncomfortable, because I can't stand having someone tell me something and not make a comment back to them (rather than stand there in awkward silence). I don't know how to react. Sometimes I think I'm borderline autistic in these social situations.


I'm sorry, how many guys just going out talking. They tell stories and 'pal around' with each other over a beer or game of pool, or watching sports. I enjoy all of those things, but absolutely fall apart in the talking bit. 


*sigh* I may as well talk about the other thing that is really bothering me lately too, have fun together, traveling together, TALKING (which holy shit I cannot do!), coming home to someone who I know will not judge me...  ugh... how do you guys do it? How do you go out there and have fun with people? I feel like I don't even know how to have fun...


This is kind of all over the place, but don't because I'm just not good enough to get out there and connect with people. I see many posts on here (reddit in general) showing silent people having many really deep thoughts but only communicating a very small amount of it. I don't have that. It feels like I have nothing to say...


I don't even know what I expect from this... But

I need to vent and ask some advice on how to deal with them.,rastapasta808,51,16,38,"So I live in a college house with 5 other guys and we get along for the most part but they are extremely ignorant of how they act.  They are very lazy and judge others when they arent doing the same thing theyre doing.

For example

When I would come downstairs

Another thing they do is use subtle exclusionary tactics during conversations.  They REALLY like to exclude individuals to enhance their own brand so to speak and it just really reminds me of middle school behavior.  Like last night

I know they are insecure but thats just ridiculous.  I cant understand why they choose to act like high-schoolers who need to impress eachother because they  dont know who they are.

But one funny thing did happen last night that opened my eyes a bit more.  We got into a conversation about pointer- and index-finger length in relation to how much testosterone and estrogen a person has.  (stupid I know)  One of my roommates who acts like a tough-guy but is by far the most sensitive person I know looked at his hands and saw that he had the weird situation where his index was longer than his pointer.  The roommate who brought up the topic told him that he had a lot of testosterone and the tough-guy roommate puffed up his chest and grabbed his balls saying ""yea I knew it"".  Then the moment of clear insecurity sprung up.  The roommate actually had it backwards and told tough-guy that he actually had a lot of estrogen and that he was really sensitive.  Ive never seen someone shrink down so fast.  It was like everything made sense to him for a second and his act that he was putting up fell to the wayside.  I wanted to ask him ""So you are really that insecure that you let an meaningless fact determine how much of a man you are?"".  Sad

Anyway

Tl;dr: Roommates are extremely insecure and cliquey and behave like middle-school girls who try to exclude people from their group.  They dont respect me as a person but I dont need their approval and would like to take the high road and get my revenge through success.

Your wish is my command!  Bonus points for interesting and creative ideas.

Edit: 

Update: I had an amazingly awesome day yesterday, however, is start the day with a social mindset, since I knew I was going to do my best to do at least some of them.  When my first class ended, I started chatting with someone from one of my classes.  We talked for 20 minutes until she had to leave, and as I was headed to grab some coffee, I saw another classmate doing some work.  I went to talk with him (never would normally do this), then ended up comparing notes and looking at our final project, so I ran into my professor as I was leaving

So, but I noticed a group of classmates from another class occupying an empty classroom just to chat.  So of course, I had to join them.  Apparently, luck was on my side yesterday.  It's a huge university, but I just kept running into people I knew.  So, we talked for half an hour or more, then I finally went for my coffee.  But I ran into an old coworker on the way, then FINALLY, and it made her happy.

Then I sat down and tried to convince myself to do more challenges.  It's so much harder than talking to people that I have an excuse to be talking with (classmates).  I feel like I'm just annoying people if I stop them when they're walking the opposite direction, I was sitting next to a girl who looked really busy, but she had a really unique/colorful jacket, so I told her that and left to find some more people.  She actually seemed offended, but it could just be her voice, since she seemed sick.  No worries.  

I was trying to walk somewhere where I wouldn't know too many fellow students, so I helped out for an hour or two.  As I left, I ran into one of the guys who was studying in a n unoccupied room earlier, and I sat with him and talked while he went to get coffee.  I might make a decent friend out of him, hurray.  Then it was already getting to be time for me to head to my next obligation, I had already killed hours.

So, but the whole damn time I was finding people to talk to and having a great time.  It was a fantastic day.  I was really lucky to run into such an absurd number of people that I knew.  I don't know how much of it is just luck, though, and how much of it is that I had my brain attuned to finding social situations.  I am a bit disappointed that I didn't do much to get outside my comfort zone, since talking to strangers is harder than what I did, for sure, but I still feel like it was a worthy way to spend my time.  

Next time I have a similar opportunity, I complimented 2 strangers, and said hi to a bunch of strangers in passing.

When I talk to people, or where they are from, or something they like to do, and for some reason, I don't really feel anything. I walk away from the conversation, and I don't even remember half of what they just told me. It's really strange. I also have a similar problem with names. If people tell me their names, I can't remember them for anything. I actually have made it a habit to ask people to write their names for me, I'm rather clueless.

The odd part about this is that I'm excellent at figuring people out. I'm extremely good at discussions with purpose (debates, confidant, and very pragmatic. Basically, everything necessary in being didactic.

However, I just have a hard time being empathetic. If I want to I put myself into someone else's shoes, I have to create the scenario in my head. From there, it all works fine. I can feel their insecurity, joys, fear, all those things. I just lack the mental shortcut that makes me ""relatable"". 

I've always been really academic, I can read people like a book, but that doesn't matter a damn if I can't even relate to them readily. I just find myself doing the usual ""agreeing"" or ""telling a related story."" I get along fine, but it feels like a chore, rather than a fun conversation where I ""meet someone new"" and ""have fun.""

**TL;DR:**  I can do all the moves

**EDIT: I think I found the solution to my problem.** If anyone reads this, courtesy of *diamond_account*:

At 20 years old I've only held a girls hand once and she was joking the whole time.  Never had sex

And even worse is that the thought of it makes me just sweat thinking about it.  I mean I'm just so sure that I'll clam up and nope the fuck out of there because I don't know what to do in that situation.  Whenever I think of my future it makes me feel bad.  It seems I'll either never have a significant other

The thing is

The difference between you and a non-clumsy person is *basically* - this is simplified - that non-clumsy people always have 1% of their brain devoted to paying attention to what their body is doing, they *look* very briefly at where their arm will be moving, and where the glass will go. It isn't a conscious effort, because it's a habit they have. It just happens automatically.

This might sound annoying to you - the idea that your thoughts will always be somewhat hampered by having to pay attention to what you're doing - but I promise that you won't even notice it. It won't cut into your daydreaming or whatever. What it will do is make life easier and increase your confidence.

So, give your movement 100% attention. Just focus on where you are, what you're doing. Obviously, make these few minutes those when you're moving around a good amount. Maybe when you're getting ready in the morning, for instance. If you do something like put a drink down, *look* first at where you are going to move your arm and put the drink down, and then do it

You'll find something amazing happens - during these minutes, you'll see that all of a sudden this is a natural habit you have whenever you do anything - and it *doesn't require thought anymore*. It's just a natural thing you do. And viola, you are no longer clumsy. And this probably won't take nearly until September - it worked for me in a few weeks.

Hope it helps!

Mise-en-scéne: I'm at a party. Suddenly I start chatting with this cute girl (girl C) and we start to hit it off. Everything is going really well until guy D (douchebag) appears and starts talking to the same girl. He interrupts me in the middle of a sentence and starts speaking over me. Then he positions himself in a way that he cuts me out from the girl. As I move to reposition myself, also staring with grins on their faces; waiting to see what happens. I get this huge 'hole in my stomach' feeling...

1.) There are people who are looking at me; waiting for my reaction. First thought I get: If I somehow insult, guy D seems to be a very popular guy. and it could hurt my standing in this group to get in the wrong side og him.

So what? Do I really need these people? Will these people liking me really affect my life in a crucial way? What can happen if they dislike me: worst-case scenario, gossip or whatever they want to do. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF PERSON I AM.

2.) Now

3.) I like this girl

4.) So I now know and accept the fact that I desire this girl sexually. Should I kill guy D (my rival) and rape girl C? That would certainly fullfil my desire. NO. HELL NO. That is wrong and I'm not going to do it. 
Should I wait a while and start trash-talking guy D to the girl? NO. I don't talk about people behind their backs.

5.) So now I know what I will not do. But what will I actually do? Is this girl really worth it? Shall I risk an unpleasantness or even a fight with guy D for a simple girl? I mean, instead of that guy. But she doesn't know it yet. I have to show it to her. And this guy and his attempts of humiliation aren't going to magically disappear. I DESIRE THIS GIRL AND I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT...

[–]esko85[S] 1 point 9 minutes ago
6.) Ok...so I'm going to do something about it. How is my current situation? This guy is trying to humiliate me in front of her so he can have her, I have to beat him. How? He's trying to get me to go buy drinks, as if I were submitted to him. I cannot let this happen. In addition, I have to keep my connection with girl C in order not to surrender her to him. What do i have? I have already started of some chemistry with girl C. In addition, I make pretty good eye contact. What do i lack?My conversation with girl C has been interrupted. Therefore, what will I do? I'll politely but firmly tell him that the bar is over there and he can help himself to buying his own drinks. Once I have said this, I will deeply look into girl C's eyes, disregarding guy D.

7.) I know what to say, I turn to girl C, look into her eyes, and with calm and confident body language keep on speaking with her.

8.) Two scenarios. One: The girl keeps on paying attention to me and the guy loses confidence. He lingers for a couple of moments and then turns and leaves. I bested him. Only natural. I don't let it get to me and keep on focusing my thoughts and energies on flirting. Two: The guy turns and stares at me. I don't flinch. The girl suddenly feels uncomfortable and leaves. I didn't get her. I didn't let myself be humiliated and gave it my best shot....oh well

To answer the question above: Everyone knows them. If you're the most popular person, you should be pretty use to everyone knowing who you are. Right? Exactly.

It's not that Im not social or anything but it's just that I want to talk with people when I feel like it or when Im interested in the topic. I really like being around my friends and in situations like that I have the feeling that I have always something to say or to talk about. When I try to remember I realised that we mainly talk about nothing. Just fooling around or topics like football or ""have you seen this on reddit""... However we havent really that much to talk about

When I think about this Im finding troubles with meeting new girls. When you meet a girl you are supposed to have good conversations about the things she likes, travelling, history, movies,... but I cant hold very long conversations about them because I dont know much about them (in a way). I really like travelling (although I havent travelled much) and I really want to see the world. Its like my dream to backpack around the world. And thats about it. I can talk a little about my dream but there I have nothing more to say about. How am I supposed to have a good/long/fun conversation about travelling if you havent really travelled much yourself and dont really know that much about travelling? I am interested in travelling though.
Another example: When a girl plays tennis, competetive?, favorite player?""* I dont come.  About music the same thing: I can ask about her favorite groups/genres/festivals but although I like a lot of music I'm not that guy that follows that one group and like every song of their albums and so have nothing more to say something like ""yeah I just listen to lots of genres"" and name some of my favorite artists. I sure can have (really) short conversations about things but after a couple of minutes max. I have nothing more to say.

**Its just that I dont know about what Im supposed to have conversations about. Im interested in a lot of things but I cant talk long about them. I sure can talk about a topic for a little time (basic questions) but I cant get further than that. I cant have a long real conversation about anything. Also with my friends we mainly haven't long conversations about anything.** When we do its mainly about girls or life

There is always this idea in my head ""how am I ever supposed to find a girl if I dont even know how to make a decent long fun conversation?"" I dont know that it's not good that you think like this but I really think Im kind of a boring guy to have a decent talk with. However Im not stupid or anything

I've even tried tuning out of my emotions during presentations for my school, but I found that I still studder horribly, and that I lose some of my precous intuition (which makes me a good speaker when I want to), the anxiety often makes me want to say whatevers necessary to get the conversation done with

I'm a 26 year old guy, but never dated.  Never done anything with a woman.  I've tried, I'm awful at meeting women.  I have friends far away, but I keep in contact with them remotely.  I've annoyed them plenty with my complaints about my situation.  I think I've lost one because of it.  I can't help it, I have no one else to talk to.  I work mostly alone, in a highly academic field.  My work peers are all older than me and married, and even still, friendly

My area isn't great for meeting people of my age and interests, but I'm more scared of staying alone like this for much longer.  I've tried Meetup, there's nothing there for me.  I don't like to play sports, and if I did, there's no kind of ""pickup league"" or anything to join.  I've never been to a bar alone, I don't think I could do it.  I go to a local coffee shop, and a book store nearby, but these places are awful for making new friends.

I have other hobbies (cooking, working out), but there are no ways for me to connect that with other people.  Classes are not an option.  The local parks department's cheap classes are things like knitting and oil painting.  Actual courses at the community college are in the hundreds of dollars, and way out of my price range.  

Dating is going even worse.  I've been on OKCupid for months, or confident enough to connect with someone.  I've sent out so many messages, few responses, no dates.  I know I should build up friends before trying to date, but it feels so awful not having someone for so long.  Please don't tell me yet again that I need to just learn to be happy by myself, and I will meet someone.  That hasn't worked for 10 years.  It is so crushing to hear that again...

TL;DR - 26 year old guy, I just need some advice that I can use, that will actually get me out of this, this time.

My boyfriend is an amazing person and I love spending time together alone with him. We're very similar on many levels

My best friend and I have gone through a relationship shift and we haven't been spending as much time together as we used to. He's been hanging out with my ex boyfriend a lot lately so I just haven't really had anyone else to hang out with other than my current boyfriend. For years we spent almost every day together just doing random stuff

My response to this is to get out, only to be counting down until I can get back home or be alone. But on nights like tonight, I'm laying on the couch all day wishing that I could just have some friends to do something with.

How can I overcome this feeling? I try to enjoy myself and actively engage in conversation in social situations

1343801689.0,xhsee,How to connect with others and have more fun things to say? Advice greatly appreciated from anyone.,,33,2,23,"I am generally troubled by socializing in subtle ways that observers probably can't tell (I smile, and I wanted to see if anyone here could share their thoughts and advice. The few things that irk me the most are:

1) connecting with anyone that isn't my close friend

2) disclosing my own feelings and emotions

3) keeping the conversation interesting in 1 on 1 situations


1) is pretty vague, as well as the nonverbal communication? My eye contact isn't particularly strong, and I don't smile enough. That could be ONE thing.

Besides that, I know that people are just trying to seek my understanding and empathy, not my stupid advice and analysis. You can't really skip small talk, but I really wish the conversation was something other than a comparison of majors, the outlook on the job market, and drunk stories. Obviously not everyone is comfortable disclosing their secrets and childhood memories to someone they've just met, but I want to be that guy that people are comfortable talking to

2) I grew up being fairly shy, i.e. approval seeking. When I'm in conversations with other people, I find myself asking WAY too many questions, many of these close-ended and concerned with finding out the facts, instead of the emotions. Problem is, usually I am not too comfortable socially, even with closer friends. Its not an anxiety sort of feeling, and I ask questions about them. Sometimes I try to ask more ""why"" questions

I just feel like I'm unable to really talk on a more human level, whereas sometimes when I'm taking a shower and feeling really relaxed, I can have these really fluent conversations with myself.

I am also a pretty blunt person. I know that you can't just ask someone to disclose their sensitive thoughts and opinionated views to you, work your way towards those topics, but I just seem to lack the social finesse of doing so.

3) For example, even though I don't feel nervous around her. I wish I had more ""general"" ammo of conversation material, ones like ""how was your summer"", or ""have you been watching the Olympics"", but a way to keep things more fresh and interesting. I'd love to eventually talk about things like passions and dreams and past experiences, but it doesn't come about easily.

Because of this I can't really tell if someone is flirting or just being friendly

I have some scenarios that I would like to give, or not and why, just for a definite answer? In other cases I'm just wondering how could I be so stupid and how to prevent my self from making similar mistakes again. So these are the situations and some background:

Girl A:
We met about 6 months ago at the beginning of the school year, and we talked about . Early on I had a crush on her, however I stopped later in the semester. That was first semester, second semester, I told her at one point I had a crush on her when we talking about people we like/liked. She thought it was sweet and said she didn't like me that way. She also like asks about if I noticed girl blah or blah, what did I think of how girl blah looked and like comments on her boobs. 

TLDR: I think she is just a friend and wants me to be more outgoing and confident when talking with girls.

Now the odd thing, I can't remember exactly what.
So my confusion is again about

Girl B:
I met her first semester as well

Yesterday/this morning she said she couldn't wait until we were at UCSD so we could go clubbing. She said something about me taking my shirt off to intimidate someone if they were an asshole and it I was just like, take shirt off, wait what?

Girl C:
So this was the second girl I had ever really had a conversation with and the first I felt was possibly flirting. Looking back on it I realize she was flirting then

I met her at the beginning of the school year in my english class. She suggested we to zumba and yoga together but I said no. She brought up some topics related to sex but claimed she had never seen a penis and claimed to be ""innocent"" and acted this way for a while, but then one of her freinds was like ""HA, thats so funny."" So I don't understand why she would have lied about that in the first place. She said we should go skinny dipping, I also said no. One of her freinds came over to my group of freinds and invited me to come sit with her and her freinds, I went over but just wasn't sure what to talk about. I waited a while, doing nothing, eventually I texted her asking her to go out to lunch but she never responded.
Some of her freinds said she liked me

Since then we have just been friends and talked in our common classes. We are both going to college in San Diego and last week she suggested we go skinny dipping

TLDR: I met a girl

Girl D
I met her shorlty after meeting girl C. We became friends over about two months at my highschool's robotics team when we spending alot of time together due to build season
We became freinds, went stargazing a few times and watched a meteor shower. She introduced me to her freinds. We went out to lunch once, but I never made a move because I was unsure. She said once she wasn't interested in dating anyone until college because she was sick of the drama, but it seems she was flirting with me and alot of her freinds said she liked me, but I was confused due to her statements. She also gave me compliments and said things like ""How are you so amazing?"" ""How are you so cool?"" ""You are so strong"" ""You are so smart"" She posted on my wall on Facebook.

TLDR: A girl I met seemed to be flirint with me



I feel from these instances I have learned that I need to be more outgoing and freindly. I need to go out of my comfort zone



Could you explain how I should have handled these situations better

In all these situations my freinds who have guys have made comments or jokes about me being strong

In the last year I feel I have made reasonable strides for me

* College life over here is different in some aspects. There are only a couple of student organisations, on a couple of occasions, organise trips. I attend the last two if I can afford them time- and money wise. But this isn't a big part of the student-scene. There are no student orgs that I'm aware of that are built on common interests, like a debate club or book circle. Nor do we have student dorms on campus, students generally live scattered across the city our uni is located in. And I live well outside that city. 
* There is a rich student nightlife in this city, and where I live is both too far away and too secluded for people to bother with (you can't reach it with public transit alone). Also, I don't have a circle of friends: I have one friend and he sometimes lets me borrow his circle. 

One thing I hear quite often is that in the professional world, but to build up a network of professionals and peers. Needless to say... these are huge problems for me.

I *don't* have a network of peers, at least, none that consider me beyond the point of being a warm body with a name. I'm often ignored, and when I try to include/invite myself (when others wont) I meet resistance. I worry what will happen after I graduate. 


The autism thing is relevant too: I don't have problems making small talk, or even speaking in public. Conversations I have just fine, but something about me is *off* and when I've asked about it in the past, I can't get good feedback on it, because people can't put their finger on it. 
In addition to that, in front of other people. It made me feel terrible, but this is the kind of feedback that I need, but I need it sooner than too late. I don't pick up on hints, not even the obvious ones, and this makes me come across as dense or stubborn sometimes.

This all happened during my college years so my college experience has not been amazing. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have are people who just take and don't give back often. So they are not the best of friends to me and we don't have much in common.

I am/was really close to my high school friends even after we all went to different colleges. When my friends had breaks from school (summer

Also I have been feeling like my friends and I were moving apart since they had their separate lives and friends at college and we never talked much when we were away (like on facebook or skype or whatever). I understand this happens and should be happy that we are even still good friends.

So last week some of my friends from high school graduated college and were coming back. I hit up the guy I consider my best friend out of the group (his name will be XYZ). I told him that my apartment is close by and even though I am taking summer school I am still down to hang out. He told me he was visiting his GF and that he would call me when he was back in town. I got excited because I would have something to do this weekend or at least in the near future!
So Friday, while sitting at home alone, I hop onto Facebook to see that a few of my high school friends, including XYZ, were at a bar close by to my place.

This just put me into a bad mood where I have been putting myself down and thinking its my fault they didn't call. It solidified the idea that I have no friends and no one wants to hang out with me. My mind is racing through all the different possibilities as to why they didn't call

I am here looking of suggestions as to what my course of action should be. Should I try to just ignore the fact that they are in town and just go on with my life knowing that friends grow apart? Should I call them to hang out and act like nothing is wrong (this would probably be my normal response)? Should I confront them about it? I am not really a confrontational person so this one would be the most difficult for me.

Any suggestions/comments/concerns are welcome! Thanks in advance!

What I've been *trying* to do, for instance, my friend is a secular humanist, I'm a christian. I asked him about what he believes, and then I talked about the ways our beliefs were similar.

If this was the logic of the world no one would have friends. There has to be reachers or people who follow others instead of being followed~ I do not want to be one of them.

Just say hello to me - give me some attention and I will be happy for that day. Its so pathetic that I need someones attention. I hate the way my ******* mind works. I want to be strong ~ independent and by myself. But why cant I??

Also if it helps I'll be staying with a family member at this new town due to financial reasoning since living at the dorms are too expensive for my family.



I think one of my biggest worries is that everyone in my classes already sort of know each other as acquaintances and will form their own groups of friendship. 

There are list on my goals I'm planning to do over the summer which includes eating healthier and getting fit. I've been lurking around the the sub femalefashionadvice for advices on how to dress because I dress very sloppy in just flare jeans and a zip up sweater.

I know I'm a mess but please help me on how to look friendly to others. Like sometimes it is frustrating for me since it seems I somehow I unknowingly alienate everyone around me. If it helps I'll be studying business (Also can anyone tell if I need business style clothing for first year university...I'm not sure if there will mandatory events to attend...if so please give suggestions for business style clothing since I always was a jeasns and sweatershirt girl).

1.) Be Happy. Theres really no point in doing anything if you arent happy about it. Hate your job? Logic tells you to quit it. Hate your life? Stop doing what you do then. Which brings us to our next point.

2.) You want to be something you are not? change. Change is scary. We all get that. But you have to. You have to completely stop doing the thing that is harming you.

BUT IVE TRIED TO CHANGE. You cry. Ive lost weight, cant talk to people.

3.)(This is where things get a little warped). This is how you change. By [20/80 rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). Most people react to this rule

So, to seem as though you are it 80% of the time. However this also means one thing. Every other thing you do also adds on to that scale. if you spend 20% of your time feeling confident, but you spend the other 50% wallowing in self pity, you will appear 87% pathetic.

To relate this back to the anecdote; they say I should've gotten her number first. That I should've gotten to know her through text to make her feel at ease and then eventually ask her out.

**My views:**

It's okay to just ask someone out for coffee after introducing yourself and you like said person after the introduction. There's no need to do it through text because text is impersonal and dodgy. It's easier to hide yourself there plus asking someone in real life implies bravery that a lot of people struggle with. Dates were made for getting to know other people.

I'm not asking you guys for advice; that's not my goal. I have my own believes and I will stick to them. I am however interested in hearing your opinions plus I'm sure there's lurkers out there who will take something from having other people discuss it.

**So

**Girls:** How do you feel about being asked out by strangers? If you're ok with it

**And general:** is it outdated to ask people out for coffee dates? My friends also seemed to imply people don't date anymore; they just meet each other at bars.

Today was my first day in lab ever since I started my exchange program abroad, how the exchange program usually works is the host lab you choose assigns you a project for the summer and they help you out and get you going with it.

Anyways, and find something that interests me. This makes me so incredibly anxious for the following reasons:  

1) The language barrier! It's hard enough trying to get a conversation with some of the students just talking about easy peasy life things. It'll be near impossible trying to get a scientific conversation going. I'm absolutely terrified of how awkward this situation can so very quickly and easily become.    

2) This program is supposed to be a give/take sort of thing. As in, I feel like I'm just take-take-taking. I asked the best english speaker today if he could walk me through some of what he's working on, and he seemed really happy to oblige which I thought was great, so I ask him ""When are you free?"" and he says ""How about day after tomorrow?"" They're all so busy and so hardworking! I'm just getting in the way like an annoying hassle. And if I decide to help out on any of their projects, which I'll most likely have to do eventually if I want to do anything besides reddit all day, they'll be even more annoyed at me because they'll have to spend more time teaching me stuff or answering my numerous questions or things like that because I'm an undergraduate with little to no knowledge of any of the sort of stuff they're doing.

First of all, remember that most people you meet will be delighted for a discussion. Example:

I moved to a state where I didn't know a soul (Montana). Luckily I was in a heavily frequented tourist area (north of Yellowstone) full of seasonal and part time employees (like myself). So one thing I tried doing was... going to bars, and have been going to random bars to watch the NBA playoffs, Hockey, or other shit. Most importantly, I found, is that there are other people at these bars also interested in the games on television. So I would sit at the bar, order a delicious Cold Smoke Scoth Ale, I'd ask ""Who are you going for"" ""I'm a Heat fan"" ""Oh cool

The ice has been broken. Then I go ""Where ya from?"" ""(Location)"" ""Oh cool, huh?"" ""Sure is, I used to be an audio engineer for the Grand Ole Opry and played music with some dudes like Vince Gill"" ""holy shit, tell me more""

Thus, being interested in who they were, and conversing on interesting and relevant topics.

So here's a challenge to those who get socially anxious about being social... alone! Try a place or event that holds your interests (concert, school, whatever) and do the most important thing you can get from someone: LEARN! Learn who they are, what they do, and how they do it. Take this interest, and reflect on it. This is the EASIEST way to make friends outside of your work/school/family setting. After 8 months of living where I am, I know about 100 people by their first name and communicate with them on very friendly levels. It's easy

I play a lotta Starcraft 2

That's true! Fear prohibits us from doing what we want. The reason you might not be as outgoing or social as you want is because your hesitant or nervous, and of course, have a lot of :

Confidence

Don't get cocky or over-arrogant, and what you do.

I play video games (i'm close to beating Skyrim, I love music (Nashville boy) so I go to a lot of musical events and meet really cool people. I play the guitar and fiddle, and have on several occasions hosted Jam Sessions with people I've never met before here in MT. I did this using Craigslist and Meetup. It's that easy. Now I have bands I play with for fun, and have greatly improved my musical abilities.
I also like sports, I exercise a lot and have met just about everyone who goes to the gym I go to. I know the owner and workers, and by just showing up 3-4 times a week, I've gotten to become great friends with other people. I found success here, and the shape my body is in makes me extremely confident!
Lastly, but I am in constant contact with people due to these activities.

So, and I'm happy to say the past 8 months have been a great success.

On a personal level, which is reciprocated, and it's all because one day at work (we work at the same place) I went up to her and said, ""Hey you're pretty cute! do you drink Cold Smokes?"" Needless to say, we've been dating for the past few months, and I'm having a blast with what we do. Fishing, hiking



That being said

Tonight: Go to a bar and/or grill, find the people next to you watching the game and just start talking about it. If you don't like sports, just say 'I'm not a big sports fan but these guys are super over-paid. Have you seen how much Lebron James makes a year?'

That's the start of your first bloom. If you don't like bars, malls. Invite a friend. Have fun. be confident.


Other part of social bloom? Don't tell me that you don't have interests! Most of you have spent at LEAST 20 years on this planet. That means you're interested in SOMETHING. Find that interest and related activities and go do it. People will join you. just go!

What's holding you back? Anxiety? Inexperience?

Remember: Fear is an illusion. Your whole life could change like *THAT* if you just open yourself up and try something new. If you're sick of the same old thing

I am not bothered by the lack of questions pointed toward me or my lack of opportunity to talk about myself: I am legitimately interested in the person's life. However

I've started working on fixing my problems, and looking for counseling options (I used to go to my schools counselor but I can't go back until I'm re-enrolled).  The change I'm having the most problem with is getting back out and socializing.  

I have enough social skills that I know how to have conversations and be friendly with people, getting dates, having sex!  I miss these things but I don't know how to start doing them.

Sorry I hope this isn't too much to read.  

If so  TL;DR: How do I get out?  Where do I go? What do I do?  ",,t5_2r275,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/183z08/id_like_to_start_getting_out_again_but_i_dont/

Naturally i just changed myself into a ""wanna be perfect guy to woo her"" which essentially turned out to be ""lame guy shes already starting to forget about"" 

She is a pretty girl so shes got other guys biting at her feet but iv had a crush on her for a long time and I'm trying to seize this opportunity. 


So how can i stay myself when talking to her? Thanks all",,t5_2r275,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/178meh/how_do_i_act_myself_around_the_girl_i_like/
