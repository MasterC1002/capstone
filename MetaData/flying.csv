I had to refuel, but this was a little extreme for my liking. I let it go for a little bit and just kept a close eye on the gauges hoping the right tank would show more than empty and the left would show that it was draining into the engine. But after about 20 min of watching these gauges with intense apprehension they never changed. So at this point I am thinking crap..Im over Vermont and theres nothing but hills and trees for like 20 miles in every direction

After I retired from UAL as a Standards Captain on the –400, right seat, left seat taking a decade or two. One big difference is that ex-Military pilots are given super-seniority and progress to the left seat much faster. Compared to the US, they also upgrade fairly rapidly because of the phenomenal growth by all Asian air carriers. By the way, after about six months at Asiana, I was moved over to KAL and found them to be identical. The only difference was the color of the uniforms and airplanes. I worked in Korea for 5 long years and although I found most of the people to be very pleasant, it’s a minefield of a work environment ... for them and for us expats.

  One of the first things I learned was that the pilots kept a web-site and reported on every training session. I don’t think this was officially sanctioned by the company, what to expect on checks, and what to look out for. For example; I used to open an aft cargo door at 100 knots to get them to initiate an RTO and I would brief them on it during the briefing. This was on the B-737 NG and many of the captains were coming off the 777 or B744 and they were used to the Master Caution System being inhibited at 80 kts. Well, for the first few days after I started that, EVERYONE rejected the takeoff. Then, all of a sudden they all “got it” and continued the takeoff (in accordance with their manuals). The word had gotten out. I figured it was an overall PLUS for the training program.
  
We expat instructors were forced upon them after the amount of fatal accidents (most of the them totally avoidable) over a decade began to be noticed by the outside world. They were basically given an ultimatum by the FAA, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand with a few stuffed in from Europe and Asia. Boeing also operated training centers in Singapore and China so they did hire some instructors from there.

  This solution has only been partially successful but still faces ingrained resistance from the Koreans. I lost track of the number of highly qualified instructors I worked with who were fired because they tried to enforce “normal” standards of performance. By normal standards, after 5 years, they finally nailed me. I still had to sign my name to their training and sometimes if I just couldn’t pass someone on a check, I had no choice but to fail them. I usually busted about 3-5 crews a year and the resistance against me built. I finally failed an extremely incompetent crew and it turned out he was the a high-ranking captain who was the Chief Line Check pilot on the fleet I was teaching on. I found out on my next monthly trip home that KAL was not going to renew my Visa. The crew I failed was given another check and continued a fly while talking about how unfair Captain Brown was.

  Any of you Boeing glass-cockpit guys will know what I mean when I describe these events. I gave them a VOR approach with an 15 mile arc from the IAF. By the way, I gave him vectors to final with a 30 degree intercept.  Of course, he failed to “Extend the FAF” and he couldn’t understand why it would not intercept the LNAV magenta line when he punched LNAV and VNAV. He made three approaches and missed approaches before he figured out that his active waypoint was “Hold at XYZ.”  Every time he punched LNAV, it would try to go back to the IAF ... just like it was supposed to do. Since it was a check, I was not allowed (by their own rules) to offer him any help. That was just one of about half dozen major errors I documented in his UNSAT paperwork. He also failed to put in ANY aileron on takeoff with a 30-knot direct crosswind (again, the weather was dictated by KAL).

  This Asiana SFO accident makes me sick and while I am surprised there are not more, they will eventually be fired too. One of the best trainees I ever had was a Korean/American (he grew up and went to school in the USA) who flew C-141’s in the USAF. When he got out, he moved back to Korea and got hired by KAL. I met him when I gave him some training and a check on the B-737 and of course, he breezed through the training. I give him annual PCs for a few years and he was always a good pilot. Then, he got involved with trying to start a pilots union and when they tired to enforce some sort of duty rigs on international flights, he was fired after being arrested and JAILED!

  The Koreans are very very bright and smart so I was puzzled by their inability to fly an airplane well. They would show up on Day 1 of training (an hour before the scheduled briefing time, putting that information to actual use was many times impossible. Crosswind landings are also an unsolvable puzzle for most of them. I never did figure it out completely, but I think I did uncover a few clues. Here is my best guess. First off, their educational system emphasizes ROTE memorization from the first day of school as little kids. As you know, that is the lowest form of learning and they act like robots. They are also taught to NEVER challenge authority and in spite of the flight training heavily emphasizing CRM/CLR, it still exists either on the surface or very subtly. You just can’t change 3000 years of culture.

  The other thing that I think plays an important role is the fact that there is virtually NO civil aircraft flying in Korea. It’s actually illegal to own a Cessna-152 and just go learn to fly. Ultra-lights and Powered Hang Gliders are Ok. I guess they don’t trust the people to not start WW III by flying 35 miles north of Inchon into North Korea.  But, F-5, F-15, and F-16 pilots who were actually terrible pilots if they had to hand fly the airplane. What a shock!

Finally

  Actually, he calls for the autopilot to be engaged at 250’ after takeoff. How much actual flight time is that? Hardly one minute. Then he might fly for hours on the autopilot and finally disengage it (MAYBE?) below 800’ after the gear was down, flaps extended and on airspeed (autothrottle). Then he might bring it in to land. Again, how much real “flight time” or real experience did he get. Minutes! Of course, on the 777 or 747, it’s the same only they get more inflated logbooks.

  So, it raises the hair on the back of my neck.

* More importantly with low wing aircraft, please stop getting in and out of the plane because it shakes the plane and fuel splashes around. If you are still in your plane before I'm fueling and want to get out, ask me to wait a minute or just stay until I'm done. I've had way too many experiences like this where fuel spills out on the wing and pilots actually get mad at me like it was my fault for missing the tank or something. 

* Even in skyhawks doing something like sliding the seat back from the outside will still shake the fuel around. Just please stop and wait ten minutes for the fueling to be done. 

* Also, you should always stay at your airplane when it is fueled. A lot of people just leave it there and run off to go to the bathroom or socialize. While you're relieving yourself in the bathroom, I could be pouring a bottle of water into your fuel tank, or stealing that nice pair of Bose headsets in your backseat. The point is don't trust a random line guy with your life. 

* Lastly, even CFIs, that I watch after topping them off, they just start up and taxi away. Mistakes happen. You should ALWAYS take fuel samples anytime before you fly and after receiving fuel. Give it a few minutes to settle though because the process of fueling will stir anything up in there, so give it a couple minutes and take your samples. 

Thanks.

      It happened sometime in 1965
knew
frustrated by pilots like my aircraft commander. He was one of those
by-the-numbers types, no “feel” for
flying.
    
      You have to be able to feel an airplane. So what if your altitude is
a little off
feels okay then it is okay. That’s what I believed. Every time he
let me make an approach
perfection. Not the slightest deviation was permitted. “If you can’t
do it when there is no pressure
pucker factor increases
was as if all the instruments were frozen – perfection
class.
     
      Then came that routine flight from the Azores to Germany. The
weather was okay; we had 45

flight all the way. Halfway to the European mainland
started getting bad. I kept getting updates by high frequency radio.
Our destination
followed shortly thereafter. All of France was down. We held for two
hours
declare an emergency because of minimum fuel. He shot two approaches and saw nothing. On the third try
    
     We made a precision radar approach; there was nothing but fuzzy fog
at minimums. The sun was setting. Now I started to sweat a little. I
turned on the instrument lights. When I looked out to where the
wings should be
from my eyes. I could barely make out a dull glow from the exhaust
stacks of the closest engine

pilot asked the engineer where we stood on fuel. The reply was
don’t know--- we’re so low that the book says the gauges are
unreliable below this point. The navigator became a little frantic.
We didn’t carry parachutes on regular MAC flights
follow the fighter pilot’s example. We would land or crash with the
airplane.
    
     The pilot then asked me which of the two nearby fighter bases had
the widest runway. I looked it up and we declared an emergency as we headed for that field. The pilot then began his briefing.
“This will be for real. No missed approach. We’ll make an ILS and
get precision radar to keep us honest. Copilot
flaps. That’ll put the approach speed a little higher
angle will be almost level
flare.”
     Why hadn’t I thought of that? Where was my “feel” and “class” now?
     The briefing continued
take over and complete the landing if you see the runway – that way
there will be less room for trouble with me trying to transition
from instruments to visual with only a second or two before
touchdown.” Hey
thought. He’s not so stupid
    
     “Until we get the runway
touchdown; until we get down to 100 feet

and call off every 25 feet. Keep me honest on the airspeed

Let’s go!” All of a sudden
making a lot of sense. Maybe he really was a pilot and maybe I had
something more to learn about flying.
  
    We made a short procedure turn to save gas. Radar helped us to get to the outer marker. Half a mile away

I could barely feel it. As smooth a landing as I have ever known
and I couldn’t even tell if we were on the runway

breathing. We had made it! We were standing still!
    
    The aircraft commander was still all pilot. “After-landing

while we still have batteries. Copilot
arrived
can’t even see the edges.”
     I left the VHF on and thanked GCA for the approach. The guys in the
tower didn’t believe we were there. They had walked outside and
couldn’t hear or see anything. We assured them that we were there
somewhere on the localizer centerline
showing on the DME.
     We waited about 20 minutes for the truck. Not being in our customary
hurry
to a reasonable rate. Then I felt it. The cockpit shuddered as if
the nose gear had run over a bump. I told the loadmaster to go out
the crew entrance to see what happened. He dropped the door (which
is immediately in front of the nose gear) 
with a loud 
“Sir
and ran smack into our nose tire with his bumper
off
    
      The pilot then told the tower that we were parking the bird right
where it was and that we would come in via the truck. It took a few
minutes to get our clothing and to button up the airplane. I climbed
out and saw the nose tires straddling the runway centerline. A few
feet away was the truck with its embarrassed driver.
     Total damage---one dent in the hood of the follow me truck where the
hatch had opened onto it.
     Then I remembered the story from Fate Is the Hunter. When Gann was
an airline copilot making a simple night range approach
kept lighting matches in front of his eyes. It scarred and
infuriated Gann. When they landed
ready to upgrade to captain. If he could handle a night-range
approach with all of that harassment
     At last I understood what true professionalism is. Being a pilot
isn’t all seat-of-the-pants flying and glory. It’s self- discipline
practice

Below is TL;DR for anyone who has their checkride on the horizon. More or less copy pasted from the write up I am sending back to my flight school: Okay here it goes. Please excuse the wall of text, this may be because he saw I scored a 95 on the written exam and didn't see the need to grille me as much as someone who maybe got a 72. On to the show...


ORAL
AIRPLANE
Asked what kind of inspections an aircraft has to go through (annual, ELT, transponder, pitot static)

Started off by saying show me we have a legal airplane. I pulled out the maintenance books that my instructor and I tabbed out and we went over the various inspections : propeller overhaul, annual, hundred hour, transponder. He didn’t have any questions on these. Added that of course POH, registration and airworthiness documents must be in plane.

What would happen if the pitot static system were blocked? (airspeed

What about if you hit a bird and your pitot tube got clogged? (just the airspeed)

What if your static system failed? (use alternate static source)

What would you do if you retract the flaps but only one side comes up and the plane is rolling to the side that Is still down? (drop the flaps again to get symmetry)

Whose responsible if the plane is in an un-airworthy state? (owner or operator

What are the four forces acting on the airplane? (lift, and when I first said weight he preferred the term gravity)

Climb performance: Using the climb performance to chart to determine climbing over a 2200 ft hill 3 miles off the end of the runway (just the example he gave me

Follow up: How would your climb performance be in the summer? (Worse

REGULATIONS
What are the currency requirements for you to carry passengers? (day: three takeoff and landings in the preceding 90 days

What if you havn’t flown in a long time? What do you have to do? (every pilot has to go through a biannual flight review)

Inoperative equipment checklists: flow chart

What do you have to do before you fly? (check the weather, am I fit to fly? Am I sick? Am I fatigued? Etc)

CHART
IR routes (military training routes)

Blue dots inside of blue lines ( national parks )

Prohibited areas, MOA’s

Some airfields have ticks around them while others are just circles

What is the ceiling of the KCHO class D? (3100 ft)

Flying from Petersburg (PTB) to new kent (w96) without a radio

Isogonic lines, it is the difference in magnetic north and true north, varies depending where you are on the planet)

What the big &amp; small number on the chart is (denotes the minimum safe altitude in that area

VFR wx req’s in different airspaces, and D airspaces. (G uncontrolled 3 miles clear of clouds, E enroute 3 miles 500 below 1000 above 2000 horizontally of clouds, D 3 miles visibility 500 below 1000 above 2000 horizontally)

What can you do if the wx at your destination is below vfr? (request SVFR clearance)

What are the requirements for SVFR at night in a class D? (pilot must be instrument rated and have IFR aircraft)

WEATHER
Looked at some graphic depictions on the computer. Asked what the curved red lines were ( warm fronts ) blue curved lines ( cold fronts ) red H (high pressur system) blue L (low pressure system).

What was a curved line that mixes red and blue segments (stationary front – when cold meets warm)

Winds aloft charts: look at the flag and say which wind the direction is and what the velocity is (long line is 10, double flag is 100 kts)

Using the current weather (45 degrees Fahrenheit) if you took off now and went to KCHO

Follow up: What temp would you expect it to freeze? (Temp drops 2 degree per 1000 ft = about 6000 ft)

FLIGHT
We went out and he stood around while I pre-flighted, explain you have PIC authority and what that means, asking for passenger assistance in watching out for birds, other aircraft, the ground, and other hazards and explaining the clock system for calling out ( X at 2 o clock ). Explain where the fire extinguisher is, show them the emergency exits and to exit at a 45 degree angle away from the engine

After getting the weather I briefed him that we would taxi to runway 15 which meant later we would have to be using a right hand pattern. After verbalizing clear left and clear right we taxi’d to the run up area, and my VOR’s were tuned in and to the right radial ( he had no questions for me about VORs). Before taking the runway I again verbalized clear on base, clear on final, runway is clear, before announcing my intentions on the advisory frequency. After takeoff we started the cross country I had planned out to KCHO. He had looked over the flight plan and weight and balance sheet just before the oral exam and had no questions about it. It’s mostly a straight shot out of Stafford which is nice, after departing the pattern turned onto my heading and we flew to our first checkpoint (the lake with the dam on it). Here he said ok you know where you are and know how to navigate yourself, let’s do some airwork. 

First we did our clearning turns, note my altitude, note my airspeed. I’m going to add a little power, then roll into the 45 degree bank, as I pass through 30 degrees of bank I’m going to put in a little nose up trim. If I am losing altitude I will take out just a few degrees of bank, if I’m climbing I will add in just a few degrees of bank. After one complete revolution we rolled right into the next one, same principles apply. These served as our clearning turns for the next maneuver.
After establishing ourselves back in straight and level flight he said we would do slow flight next. Again walked myself through it, immediately flaps 10, flaps 20 as I pass through 80 knots, flaps 30 as I pass through 65, add in nose up trim, hear the stall horn power up. We did a turn to the left followed by a turn to the right, these served as our clearing turns for the next maneuver. Then he had me recover. (He gave me the option to go straight into the power off stall a few seconds later but at this point I had already committed to the recovery).
Next was the power off stall. Set up the same as slow flight. Noted altitude and heading, flaps in, nose trim, backpressure on the yoke. There’s the stall and recover. I left the flaps in until was certain we had a clear positive climb in. After that was the power on stall, I had trouble getting it to actually stall, finally we felt some buffets and I just recovered from that. He said we didn’t actually hit the stall but it was acceptable.

Next we did the instrument portion. I forgot to bring a hood but we made due by putting some tape over my sunglasses in flight, watch your standard rate turn, vertical speed, and directional gyro. Then we lost the DG and had to turn off the compass. So watch your standard rate turn, vertical speed, and compass. He was satisfied with all of that, so I took the makeshift hood off and he said ok now you’ve got to do an emergency descent. I drew a blank for a while. I had only done this once with my instructor and that was a good 8 months prior. So I thought through it logically and just pointed the nose at the ground with a little bit of bank. We leveled off at 2000’ and he said ok now you’ve lost your engine. Ran through the emergency procedures. Pitch for 65, shut off the master switch and crack your doors and windows. At 1000’ he called go around. Then we did our ground reference maneuvers. He gave me the choice of doing S turns or turn about a point. I chose to do turn about a point. We picked a nice big water tower

Again on every pattern I verbalized “clear on final, I landed a little harder than I would have liked for soft field but he said it was fine. Then we did our soft field takeoff, flaps 10, pull the yoke all the way back, no braking, no problems there. Next was the short field landing. He said you’re aiming for the 1000’ markers (big white blocks on the runway). Land short and you fail cause you’re in the grass, you’ve got a 200 ft window past the markers. That was fine, hold the brakes, not necessarily land in one,self

There's an old saying in aviation: “It's better to be on the ground wishing you were flying than to be flying

There are dozens of aphorisms that get passed from instructor to student through the decades. If I had to pick just one to pass on to the students I hope to one day instruct

For about thirty seconds around Hour 288, deaf, and mute. I was frightened---more frightened than I'd been in my life. I had a critical decision to make and only seconds to make it. Quickly weighing my options, with survival seemingly in the balance, a quiet voice reminded me that, at that moment, I was flying while desperately wishing I was on the ground. It's a voice I hope never to hear again.

-------------------
I figured I would share my experience, I think there were a couple things that happened last night that I and hopefully everyone else can learn from.

I was flying from KHDN (Hayden, TX) which is home base. It was me and two other company pilots on board. I'm still fairly new to the Pilatus PC12, so I took the ""empty"" (not counting the other company pilot in back) leg to get some more experience in it. We left around 5:30pm or so, noting that there was a line of storms building across central Texas, but it still looked like we could make our way around or through it.

An hour and a half or so into the flight, we were the pink dot.](http://imgur.com/aDU69LO,U6brsw8)

So

Darkness fell, TX, right on the border.) As we got near JCT, Ft. Worth center gave us a reroute over DLF, and I looked at our fuel. We didn't have enough to go that far. That was a 3 hour flight, we had 3:14 of fuel. Not happening.

A quick glance at the onboard radar showed no echoes in front of us

Before we had a chance to discuss much else, and just about when I got to 150, *WHAM*. My head hit the ceiling, and anything not secured went flying everywhere. Not 2 seconds after that, Heavy rain and/or hail started falling. I managed to reach up and turn on all of the ice protection despite feeling like a marble in a spray paint can.

The next several seconds were a blur

Now, but don't load the wings too much in the process. The goal is to minimize accelerations, navigation and altitude are secondary. DO NOT USE THE AUTOPILOT.

The right seat pilot, making matters worse, and it would disconnect itself after a second or two anyway. I was a bit tied up mentally, so manners were out the window, and I finally yelled at him to leave the fucking autopilot off. I figured the autopilot constantly disconnecting itself would be enough to get the hint after a couple tries, but no.

While it felt like we were in this first wave for 20 minutes, the controller asked us about our altitude. We told him about the severe turbulence and that we may need some block altitudes. He happily gave us discretion on the altitude. I clicked the autopilot back on, and started getting back on altitude.

Another look at the onboard radar, but you can't avoid what you can't find. The only thing showing up was the line, still 40+ miles south of us.

I glance out the side window to look at the wing. It looked like a snow cone. Boots were on

Just as we had caught our breath and started again to figure out where to go, the right seater just kept turning the autopilot on after it disconnected itself. I don't know if it was stress, fear, or just bad habits, but yet again, I had to snap at him to get him to quit.

[Radar of about where/when the severe ice and turbulence were](http://imgur.com/aDU69LO

I hear the cooler in the back hit the roof and ice and sodas bouncing around. I've got a death grip on the yoke and am doing all I can to keep the thing level. Despite my best efforts, what I'm sure was a minute or two felt like eternity.

Wave 2 subsided, time to plan.

I propose we find a nearby airport that has decent weather and go for it. We're over central-ish Texas, the one in the back agrees without hesitation, but the right seat is still looking at getting around the line to get home.

After a short discussion, he basically said ""Do whatever you need to do, own navigation, 4000' or higher until you see the field. This freed us up to dodge what we could see now as there were some breaks in the IMC. 

After a relatively uneventful visual approach to KSJT and a couple of hours of waiting to see what the weather would do

**Hour 83**

We were on a 2 mile final and I was sweating. It was a sunny afternoon in May. A few minutes earlier when we’d slowed to approach speed, was at my side. 

Fuel selector … both.

Carb heat … on.

The Santa Monica PAPI was showing three white and one red.  I’ve gotta get down there...

Flaps … full.

Seatbelts … fas--

My concentration was interrupted by a sudden whoosh of air in the cockpit.  I looked over and

“Am I allowed to open the window like that?” he asked. I was now on short final. My blood pressure started to rise.

“I-- I don’t know.”

“Is the plane still flying?” Gary persisted.

I started to feel overloaded. “Let’s talk about this on the ground.”

“Good

We landed. Once the propeller stopped

“Listen carefully. Lots of things are going to happen to you up there. Maybe a window opens

Gary was right. I would later read about many accidents caused by pilot distraction.  Perhaps the most famous is [Eastern Airlines Flight 401](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_401).  Shortly before landing on a dark night


**Hour 142**

Vegas

Several months had passed since the window incident. I was now a private pilot and well into my instrument training. I was also an airplane owner! After months of searching I’d finally brought home a Cessna Cardinal RG.  I’d already gotten 10 hours of dual instruction in my new craft, so I hadn’t planned to stay -- just fly up, get a bite to eat at the airport, and fly home.

My plan was to land at Las Vegas International which lies at the center of a mass of Class B airspace.  Learning to fly around LAX

It was a sweltering Saturday afternoon.  The weather was perfect

“Make sure you’re hydrated before you go up there

Wise advice, there’s almost nothing that beats flying 165 m.p.h over a highway while the cars underneath you are stuck in traffic.  I settled in at 7,500’ for the 90 minute flight. Vegas, baby!

As I reached the desert I realized a slight flaw in my flight planning.  All that water was having the obvious effect.  I had to pee. *It’s not that bad

Over the next ten minutes my body informed me

OK

All right.  Almost there.  Now for Step 2: refill the bottle. The air was smooth and the radio was quiet.  I might just be able to get away with this!

I carefully trimmed the plane until it flew straight and level without control inputs. I took my hands off the controls tentatively -- nothing seemed to happen. *All right, ever-so-carefully unzipped and got myself into it. The relief that followed was indescribable.  Euphoria!

Relief quickly turned to panic. The bottle seemed to be filling at an alarming rate.  Was it possible that my bladder actually had a larger capacity than this bottle? I really didn’t want to find out empirically.  I’d owned this plane for 3 weeks and I sure wasn’t going to let my own pee geyser erupt from this bottle all over my upholstery!

Alas, one hand holding the bottle and the other holding myself to prevent pee from spraying everywhere like a loose firehose.  I had no hands free to fly the plane.  The situation was … let's just say: delicate.

The third time through this dance I realized something alarming: my gonads were cold.  Oh no!  Cold gonads must mean there was a fluid leak.  Crap!

Then I noticed something else: a hiss.   *Ssssssss.......*  What was that?  I realized I was cold because of air

A moment later

Oh.  Holy.  Hell.

My indicated airspeed was about 120 m.p.h. and turbulent air was rushing around the cockpit.  It was also the first moment in my life I remember being afraid of heights.  I sat for a moment

*Don’t panic*

Oh god. Ok. Let’s figure this out.  First thing’s first: I decided that this was not an emergency.  Flailing around would make it one -- let’s avoid that. The only thing that would make this an emergency

All right. I decided I was safe. What next?  I needed both hands to close and latch the door.  My hands, I reasoned, the correct next step was to finish peeing.  I would look back later and see this as having been my first major executive decision as a pilot-in-command.  With wind whipping around my feet I filled the remaining third of the bottle, sealed it up, and set it on the floor like a boss.

Finally, slowed the plane down to about 75, and was able to slam and latch it at last.

I made my way into Las Vegas

I took 20 steps and froze: it was Las Vegas.  It was a Saturday afternoon.  Playboys and party girls were descending on the city.  There were two private jets parked in front of me; they literally had red carpets running out to them.  Fashionable men were emerging from the aircraft with women on their arms -- blonde, and holding a warm bottle of my own piss. 

I couldn’t do it.  I turned back.  I found a quiet spot on the tarmac near my tie-down and emptied the bottle onto the ground.  I hoped it would be discrete

“Well

Wrong.

“CLEAR!”  Someone parked in the next row started up their turboprop.  The propwash started to propel my giant ocean of shame downwind

I looked up to see a lineman giving me a icy glare.  He shook his head sadly and drove off.

I returned to Vegas a couple of weeks later.   It doesn’t rain there very often so the ramp was still stained yellow. I hope it's gone by now,,False,self,t5_2qm1t,1341289807.0,,True

EDIT: ""Tonight"" was last night.

This just in from the Columbia Seaplane Pilots Association... State senate is voting tomorrow morning on this issue (SB 602) that could prevent state waters from being used by aircraft. If you're an Oregon pilot, my state senator is Richard Devlin. Here's my letter to him:

=====

&gt;Senator Devlin

&gt;As both a pilot and a canoe paddler

&gt;Floatplanes have a very light environmental footprint, in essence, just like a kayak or canoe in terms of impact, and they number far fewer than boats.

&gt;SB 602 would prevent pilots from using Waldo Lake and other state waters for landing, however our state has a large body of active pilots who stand firmly on this issue that our state waters remain open. To deny them access would be unfair, and has few benefits. For example, Minnesota enjoys a very healthy and active float flying population that even contributes to many of the local economies around the state, as do Washington, Alaska, Florida

&gt;Please vote NO on SB 602 and help preserve my access to public waters.

&gt;Sincerely
&gt;------ -----------

**Hour 195**

I shut down the plane, of course: there’s no better way to make sure the weather is clear than to go up in the air for instrument training. I’d been flying under the hood for an hour and half and was exhausted.

“Workin’ pretty hard today

“No

“Oh yeah? Why isn’t my shirt soaked then?”

I laughed -- he’d caught me. Mental note: wear light shirts for flight training.

“It’s hard, and there will be clouds, and you’ll be able to use your instrument ticket to get home. And let me tell you something, if the weather is low, and you come all the way down to minimums and then pop out of the clouds with the runway right where it’s supposed to be...”.  He got a faraway look in his eyes for a moment, then looked back at me.

“It’s better than sex.”


**Hour 326**

“You should come out! We’re having a barbeque for the Fourth of July!”

We’d gotten the same offer two years in a row. Last year we hadn’t really considered it, worked with a woman who lived in Chino. With traffic, it was nearly a two hour drive from Santa Monica; how she ever survived that daily commute on LA freeways I’ll never know. The year before, the prospect of spending that much time on the road for a barbeque didn’t seem all that appealing. But this year I was an aircraft owner.  Once we found out she lived a few miles from the Chino airport? Of course we’ll be there!

The afternoon of the Fourth was a mild, and started to head east. The sheer size of Los Angeles is just amazing, and I really never appreciated it until I started flying.  Most cities have a tightly packed downtown area that quickly becomes greener and more suburban.  LA, in contrast, is just mile after unending mile of dense city.  We stayed fairly low, at about 2,000’, my landmark that it was safe to start heading further south.  I punched Chino into my GPS.

As a precaution, and I hear about updated areas of restricted airspace and hazards such as skydivers. My plan was to squeeze in between the Los Angeles Bravo and El Monte’s Class D airspace. Flight following was an extra pair of eyes on radar warning me if I went astray.  Plus if I did violate the Bravo, the impact would be minimized since I’d already be talking to its owner. Controllers get much more upset over violations by someone they’re not talking to than someone they are.

It was a perfect day to fly. The air was smooth and it wasn’t too warm. Staying that low, the airspeed indicator was creeping into the yellow.

D. and I had a guest in the plane.  One of her co-workers also lived in Santa Monica and wanted a ride. She was soaking it all up. “So you can just fly up here however you want?” “How fast are we going?” “How many airports are there around here?”

The barbecue was great fun. I didn’t drink, our hosts dropped us back off at the airport on their way to see the Chino fireworks. 

“Are the fireworks going to hit your plane?” they asked.

Well that was certainly a good question! The briefer hadn’t mentioned anything about fireworks when I’d called in the morning. I called back and still he didn’t mention anything

“It’s Fourth of July

“There’s nothing in the NOTAMs about it. I think fireworks usually don’t go above about 3 to 400 feet.”

Well that’s a relief.

I got out my night-flying kit -- flashlights of every size and shape -- and preflighted the plane. The three of us climbed in.  We launched into the balmy

Fireworks. Fireworks *everywhere.*

Even on a normal day, there were literally dozens of fireworks exploding somewhere below us. It was a dynamic, undulating carpet of bursting color that moved as you watched it. It was just stunning. Both my passengers spent the next 20 minutes with their noses pressed against the plexiglas.

“It’s just … oh my god

I had to pry my eyes off the ground and remember to fly the plane. I tuned in the Santa Monica ATIS and the halting

“Santa Monica Airport, overcast, six hundred...”

The marine layer had come in.  It had come in right at minimums. This was getting interesting.

Van Nuys was just 6 miles to the north and was usually a good backup - they had an ILS, maybe even try it twice, and then go to Van Nuys.  We still had four hours of fuel.

“We might end up at Van Nuys

I told flight following I wanted a pop-up IFR clearance

“Cardinal 15H, maintain 3,000 until established, cleared for the approach.” 

Then I saw it: a thick layer of clouds below

“OK guys. I need your help. We’re going to be going right down to minimums

The clouds were just a couple of hundred feet below us. I checked the GPS. The status panel had gone from ARMED to ACTIVE -- we had the computer’s blessing to shoot the approach.

“We’re going in.”

We reached the cloud tops and continued down. The plane sank into a thick fog. The wingtips were barely visible and the strobe lights reflected brightly back into the cockpit.

“Whoa

We were right on course. I’d done this approach dozens of times in training … but usually wearing a hood.

“One thousand, with a thousand feet left to go before we had to abandon the approach.

I worked on keeping my breathing even. The air was silky smooth so the approach was going well.  We were still going right down the center.

“500.”

We passed the last waypoint

“300.”

The cockpit was totally silent other than the even sounds of the engine. We were still in a thick soup.

“200.”

In my peripheral vision

“100.”

“I see the ground!” our back-seat passenger said in an excited whisper.

D. was up front. She was still peering out the windscreen.

“50.”

I had my hand on the throttle to avoid overshooting. I was about to move it when--

“I see it!”

We popped out the bottom. The runway was ahead and to our right

Fan...fucking... *tastic*.

I made my last traffic calls on the CTAF and landed.  I pulled off the runway and the moment I stopped

It was my first approach to minimums. Gary had been right again.

Shortly after takeoff from a busy Class D

The smell was not one of burning oil, I assumed that an electrical fire was at least a possibility.

I was only maybe a mile upwind, who was clearing another aircraft for takeoff behind me, told them I was declaring an emergency, that I had smoke in the cockpit, returning immediately to the field and landing on the runway I took off from, and that I'd be turning off my radios.

Just before I flipped the master switch off, there was a huge hulk of a firetruck, and a pickup truck from the airport authority. I pulled the mixture, parked the plane, and got out. 

By now the smoke had cleared out, and radio'ed the tower to ask if they needed any further information from me. ""No,"" was the answer.

So, it was benign, and probably would have stopped in its own in a few minutes.

However

Anyhow, I suppose). ATC and the rest of the system is there to help you get from place to place safely, and they will do whatever they can to make sure that happens.

**Hour 34**

Learning to fly in Santa Monica has advantages and disadvantages.  There's certainly no shortage of interesting things to see on the ground -- whether it's the shoreline, or Griffith Park Observatory, L.A. basin pilots get to see a lot more than student pilots in a random town in Oklahoma.  The congested airspace is among the most complex in the country, with LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Orange County, Santa Monica

It had been just a few days since my first solo and I was feeling on top of the world.  This was a problem for my instructor, and one part car salesman.  (He was, in reality, all three of these things.)  With over 8,000 hours of instruction under his belt, he felt strongly that an overconfident pilot was an unsafe pilot.  My recent success required a new challenge to keep my ego in check.

""You're going to get a real workout today

He first had me fly to Van Nuys, and he said, ""Ok.  Now fly me to Burbank.""

Burbank?  That airport 6 miles away that has commercial service?  737s and MD80s lined up for miles to land? The one in the middle of Class C airspace?  You want me to land *there*?

He sat back and let me sweat.  There'd be just 4 minutes from takeoff to landing; in that time, I turned east.  Sweating profusely, I got a handoff from Van Nuys Tower to SoCal Approach, then to Burbank.  Before I knew it, I'd landed on Runway 8.  I pulled off the runway just as a 737 roared overhead, departing the intersecting runway.  I had to admit, tough as it was

""OK

""Tell him you want to do some pattern work.""

I looked around.  It was mid-morning -- aviation rush hour.  The airport was buzzing with activity.  A dozen big passenger jets were taxiing around.

""Pattern work *here*?  Really?""

""I told you you were in for a workout.""

The controller was surprisingly happy with the idea.  He'd have us take off from one runway and land on the other, but I didn't care -- waiting in line with big commercial jets, talking to the same controllers, and using the same runways made me feel like a real pilot!

Burbank has two [intersecting runways](http://img.airnav.com/aptdiag/w240/02315.gif), ""Cessna 123, Runway 15, cleared to land, hold short of runway 8."" But in practice, the distance from the Runway 15 threshold to the intersection is about 5,000'

So there I was, and a few moments later when we were directly abeam the end of the runway I heard: ""Cessna 831, turn left direct for the numbers now, Runway 15, cleared to land. Traffic on a 4 mile final."" In other words, someone else was also lining up to land on Runway 15 and the controller was trying to sneak me in first.

Attempting to comply, but we were still ridiculously high.  Crossing over the Runway 15 threshold I was still 200' in the air. I pushed the yoke, trying to coax the plane onto the ground, but picked up way too much speed as the plane went downhill.  With half the 6,800' runway behind us, I was still 30 knots too fast. I wrestled the Cessna to the ground, bounced high, and finally got the wheels down as the airspeed bled off. As we rolled out

""Southwest 624

Awww

In addition to the guy behind me, he'd just have the conflicting traffic go around and try again.  And this is how, one day, I cost Southwest Airlines $5,000 worth of fuel.  Oops.

20 minutes later we were ready to go home.  ""Sorry we made that guy go around

""Sorry we didn't get you around more times!""

I laughed -- no hard feelings on the ground

""First of all

Then he said something that's always stuck with me:

""And don't you apologize for using an airport or talking to a controller.  It's your airspace just as much as anyone else's.""

I have to open this story with an admission: I didn’t tell the entire story of my [flight out of Winslow](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/wiuah/my_first_1000_winslow/). For every takeoff

**Hour 358**

Even after the engine cooled after our frightening takeoff, it’s exhausting. During the cruise phase of a normal flight I get to sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the world pass underneath. In turbulent flight, it’s a constant battle to keep the plane on the right heading and at the correct altitude, constantly re-trimming and fussing with the throttle, rarely getting more than a few moments of rest. My stress level skyrocketed as we left Winslow

By the time we reached Alburquerque, “If I have to abort the landing and go around, I want to make damned sure I have enough speed to climb out.” I’d been so frightened by what happened in Winslow that I was now irrationally hoarding energy exactly as a man who once almost died of starvation might hoard food. My approach speed kept creeping up and up -- the runway is 13,000’ long, I reasoned, so why not?

Touching down at 120mph in a plane whose normal touchdown speed is 65 certainly taught me a lesson. The moment the main landing gear touched the tarmac, landed nosewheel-first again, and bounced another 20 feet up. After a third bounce I realized what was happening and, near the top of the bounce, applied full power with the intention of going around. I then had a moment of terror: even at full power, I could not completely arrest the descent. The pilot-induced oscillation was so bad at that point that after the bounce the plane continued its trajectory slowly downward until the mains kissed the ground with the engine blazing. In an instant, I decided this was good enough, and focused on keeping the plane on the runway centerline as I bled off airspeed for the next 4, my worst.

Dad and I found a hotel. I had dinner with a depressed cloud over my head and fell asleep immediately afterwards

**Hour 359**

The next day I resolved to solve the problems from the day before. Specifically:

* We'd leave as early as possible

* We'd plan a short segment so that we'd be able to take off without full fuel

Between the cooler air temperature (i.e., the climb should be much easier. Of course, Dad was fine with waking up early, because he was still on East coast time and didn't want a repeat performance of Winslow any more than I did. We picked Dodge City, Kansas as our destination. My pilot friend Morten, who was also based at Santa Monica, had coincidentally been there the day before on his way back from OshKosh. He'd called to tell me it was a nice place to stop

We were at the airport by 7am

I filed our IFR flight plan and by 7:40 we were holding in position at the end of ABQ's wonderfully long, Vr+5, Vr+10, Vr+15... by Vr+20 the plane was begging to be let into the air. I released the forward pressure I'd been holding on the yoke and we leapt up into the piercingly blue, crystal-clear sky. We climbed at 700 feet per minute! That's almost ten times faster than our climb out of Winslow. In fact, it's not unreasonable performance even for a sea level takeoff, home in Santa Monica!

My mood instantly changed. *Ha

Our trip over the remainder of the Rockies was wonderfully uneventful. The early morning air was completely smooth; we sailed over the mountains at 11, and really enjoying looking down at the fantastic scenery. In two hours time, the Rockies gave way to Kansas and the Great Plains. Minute by minute we could see the terrain dropping lower and lower under us. Before we knew it, it was time to land in Dodge City, after penetrating a tiny layer of scattered clouds. I brought us in for a nice landing, which was quite a relief after my terrible performance in Albuquerque.

We taxied to the parking area, one more minor task--we had to cancel our IFR flight plan. In other words, we had tell Air Traffic Control that we were safely on the ground. If you don't do this, they send out a search and rescue party. I powered up the avionics, and on my #1 radio, started to announce, ""Kansas City Center, canceling IFR..."" until there was a fizz and a pop and I realized my radio was completely dark.

Wait. What? No radio? Please tell me this isn't happening.

I turned everything off and back on again

Dodge City may be a great place to go if you want to see a re-enacted gun fight

Well, and stopped by the local auto parts store to buy a fuse and some screwdrivers. Back at the airport, I took my radio out of the panel and confirmed that the fuse was blown... but, replacing it just resulted in another blown fuse. Something was wrong. And the nearest avionics shop was 120 miles away in Wichita!

But how do we get to Wichita with clouds in the sky and only one working radio? And a marginally crappy radio

1350998966.0,11y0ps,I watched a plane crash the other day,brotein-shake,86,13,73,"It was the weirdest feeling.

I was at work at the airport

I watched it take off. I saw it was a Cessna with wheel farings, and I'd estimate between 150-250 feet AGL it stopped climbing. Over the noise of the mower I was driving I could not tell if the engine had failed or not. It kind of just leveled off. Then it disappeared beyond the trees. Of course, my initial thought was the worst case - it crashed. But then I got over that and thought *what are the odds that that would happen today?*. I let the thought go and went back to the cutting.

About 15 minutes later my phone started blowing up with calls

I couldn't really believe it. I said

""No

""What happened?!"" I asked

""A 152 took off and crashed into the trees. We aren't really sure what happened yet.""

The rest of the day went about surprisingly normal. I had to cover the office while everyone went to see the wreck so I didn't get to personally see it

So apparently, climb 30 feet down the tree, and leave with nothing but a scratch or two. The airplane was not as lucky. I saw pictures of it in the trees - all crunched up, completely destroyed. One wing was hanging off and it leaked up to 20 gallons of fuel. Amazingly though, no fire and no injuries. They said they went into the trees, shut the master off, called 911, and were on the ground by the time rescue personell arrived. They refused any medical treatment

**TL;DR:** 152 takes off and crashes in the trees - completely destroying the aircraft; both pilots walk away with just a few scratches.

**EDIT: PICTURES.** [In the tree.](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/d6/0d6a2170-1d28-11e2-ab11-0019bb2963f4/5086ba8f91ebf.preview-300.jpg)

1342468591.0,wnsb2,PASSED MY CHECK RIDE! I'M A PPL AT LAST!,BIG_Python,78,7,19,"I just got home from the airport with what can be described as a huge sense of accomplishment.

I passed the oral part of the exam easily and only missed one question 

I then flew out of centennial

I did a little hood flying with no problems

I quickly went through my ABC`s of engine failure and recovered. I was then told to enter into a steep turn to the left which I did

The examiner had me set up for slow flight

It has always been a challenge for me keeping my altitude in slow flight

I transitioned into a power off stall and corrected quickly with full power and flaps 20. 

We then did turns around a point

I got the ATIS for centennial and called up tower for some touch and gos. They told me to enter a left downwind for 17L and report midfield.

I descended to pattern altitude (6800) and reported the midfield and was cleared number 2 after a Cherokee for touch and go on 17R. 

The Cherokee was flying a really wide pattern so I had to extend the downwind a few miles. I pulled the throttle back and put flaps to 10 and then turned base. I put flaps to 20 and then turned final

I kept a little extra altitude on the approach and pitched the plane for 70KIAS. I flew the plane right above the runway and held it in ground effect and I held the left aileron into the wind (7 knt x-wind) and used the right rudder to keep me aligned.

I flared and the left wheel kissed the ground with a SWISH followed by the right and then finally the nose. It was one of the best landings I have ever had.

I then did a soft field touch and go

I had been working with my instructor for the last 6 flight hours on short field landing as it is

I made my descent and slipped the plane forward to lose a few hundred feet and I faced my enemy

I had to land within 200 ft of those numbers to pass

I pulled the nose up when I hit ground effect and pulled the throttle to idle

I goosed the throttle and pointed the nose at the chevrons on the threshold

The wheels set down on the runway buttery smooth and I let out a huge sigh of relief followed by a realization of the magnitude of the sweat puddle I was sitting in. 

I taxid of the runway

**Part I: Apple Valley. Hour 116**

Flying is one of my passions, I was also finishing my Ph.D. in computer science. This wasn’t a coincidence: I started learning to fly partly because I was going stir-crazy writing my dissertation. What better antidote than spending a few hours a week in the beautiful blue sky, a mile above the nearest computer screen?

My family was planning on flying out to LA from the East Coast for my graduation ceremony. I hadn’t told them that I was learning to fly yet; my mom’s a nervous flyer

The weather gods would not make it easy for me. 2003 was one of the worst years for June Gloom in memory, the unprecedented Gloom was filling the entire LA basin. Every airport for miles was clouded over one day after the next.  My Night Cross-Country had been cancelled so many times that I went so far as to do it in Las Vegas (described in [Death Vortex](http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/vroga/my_first_1000_death_vortex/)), leaving just one final hurdle: the checkride. But the unrelenting clouds caused my first three checkride appointments to be cancelled, too. With just a week left until graduation and my parents’ visit, I decided I had to take drastic action: return to the desert.

Apple Valley Airport is a sleepy little untowered field in a small town on the edge of the Mojave Desert. Apple Valley is best known to LA residents, you retroactively become the pilot-in-command on your own checkride if you pass it!

One gloomy Monday morning I set out for Apple Valley. It was a two hour drive. The clouds didn’t break until I’d driven into the rugged San Bernardino mountains and saw the desert on the other side. I found the airport and quickly learned my first lesson of the day: small-town FBOs are nothing like their big-city counterparts. In Santa Monica, military flight helmets, and boxes of oil; I couldn’t tell if it was a pilot shop or a badly curated museum. A cat was sleeping on the couch. The owner was a grizzled lady full of war stories told in between drags on her chain-smoked cigarettes.

The plane matched the school. The old Cessna 172’s center panel had nothing in it but a single comm radio and a transponder without an altitude encoder. I asked to see the maintenance logs and flipped through them

“She ain’t that pretty

An instructor took me up for two hours, slow flight, emergency procedures, and five takeoffs and landings. By then the afternoon sun was heating the desert floor; the cockpit was stifling and the sharp turbulence was exhausting.

Back on the ground, weight and balance computations, and emergency procedures. He wanted to see my cross-country flight plan and describe navigation procedures. It seemed to go on forever--

“What would you do if you lost your alternator?”

“What does this color line on the chart mean?” 

""When do you lean the fuel mixture?  What happens if you lean it too much?""

“Describe how you’d look at a weather briefing and decide if it’s safe to fly.”

“How much does a gallon of avgas weigh?”

“Do I have to wear a seatbelt while we’re taxiing?”

I longed to be back at my dissertation defense from the week before. At least there I was an expert!

Next he inspected my logbook. All seemed in order at first

“Why does his CFI number here not match the other CFI number in this entry?”

“One of the forms is missing.”

“This entry isn’t signed.”

Finally he brought the hammer down:

“Sorry

I tried to hide my disappointment. Wednesday was the last day before
graduation.  That was cutting it close.  I tried not to brood on the two hour drive home.

Tuesday I filed my dissertation

The checkride itself was surprisingly anti-climactic. We did all the same procedures I’d practiced many times over. My only moment of panic was when the instructor wanted to test my unusual attitude recovery under the hood -- and I realized my hood was in my apartment

“It’s okay
back
half of the windscreen.

As we entered the pattern for my last landing, tearing its way across the empty desert floor. I smiled: I sure knew what that was after my encounter with one the week before!

“There’s a dust devil out there

“So … you’re feeling pretty relaxed about the exam

I made my last landing and parked. The examiner pulled a portable
printer out of his bag which clicked and whirred. Then he handed me a white piece of paper. It was a Temporary Airman Certificate with my name on it!

I couldn’t believe it -- I’d done it! *I was a pilot!*

**Part II: Gary Busey**

I said goodbye to the examiner, and started my journey home. The drive went quickly as I turned the recent events over in my head: I was now a PhD. I was now a pilot. What a week!

I tried to call my girlfriend; got her voicemail. Called another buddy of mine; he wasn’t in the office. I couldn’t tell my family; tomorrow was the big reveal. I had my most exciting news in a year and no one was around to hear. How frustrating!

Back in Santa Monica
horrible afternoon traffic -- and that’s when the exhaustion hit
me. I’d been driving and flying since 5am. Traffic inched forward one
car-length at a time and I struggled to keep my eyes open. I also
gradually became aware of a really foul odor of tobacco. I’d been in
the smoky flight school for 3 hours

“Don’t you just want to grab a shotgun and clear all these fuckers out?”

I turned. In the lane to my left was a long, and there, sitting in the passenger seat, teeth gleaming, was Gary Fucking Busey. I felt delirious with exhaustion and wasn’t sure this was actually happening.

We started to chat. He told me I should watch his new show

“So

I blurted out first thing that came to mind: “I just got my private pilot license 3 hours ago!”

Great. I had dozens of friends and family who might like to hear this news

“Congrats

“Yeah

“Justice Aviation!” he said excitedly. 

“That’s my flight school too!”

The light turned green and his car started to move. In parting, don’t fly your car! WHOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOoooooo!” 

That evening

“You know

“Oh

“Yeah, laughing. “He told me.”

Hope to be able to fly in some very mild IMC tomorrow!

**Flight portion:**

Departed IFR from KVNY to KCMA, taxi back, departed VFR for unusual attitude recoveries.  7nm DME off of the 210 radial from FIM (GPS used for DME), then direct entry hold on R200 FIM.  VOR-A back into KVNY.  Total Hobbs time was 2 hours, about 20 minutes of which was flying in circles trying to get a word in edgewide with SoCal approach coming back in VFR.  Almost would have been better to go back to Pt Mugu's airspace and file IFR!

**Oral portion questions of note**

* LOTS of questions on aircraft systems:  How is each primary flight system powered (specific to the aircraft)
* Icing questions: Anti-ice vs de-ice, what is the most common type (rime), what to do if encountered on various points on the cross country.
* Identifying failures (vacuum, what fails and what do you do
* Nav systems
* How does a VOR work
* GPS questions (components, alternate airports when using GPS, can you overlay GPS for a VOR approach 
* Couple of questions on IFR currency 
* Talked about my XC
* Go/no go decision, etc)
* Only a few questions on low altitude map and IAP symbology
* Questions on reading METARs, surface charts
* If 60nm from a VOR
* If on VNY CANOG1 and you can't get in touch with SoCal (due to busy frequency, however I pointed out that the phrasing ""if not in contact with socal..."" is a bit ambiguous.
* If an altimeter is reading 80ft off, so it's not regulatory, so you can just adjust it.  However still a good idea to fix it.
* Localizer back course

Hope the notes help someone!  If anyone is at VNY or the area,False,self,t5_2qm1t,1362461703.0,,ppl,t3_19ovz9

I thought other people's descriptions of their checkrides were very helpful when I was preparing. So for anyone else preparing for the practical test

First, I had accumulated 50 hours and I was ready for my checkride! The day before I was scheduled for my checkride, I came down with a cold and determined (using the IMSAFE checklist) that I should not fly the next day. This was very unfortunate timing, because I was about to take a summer course pretty far away, so I would not be able to test any time soon. After the summer class ended, I became responsible for my own finances, and immediately lost the ability to pay for lessons. I went 1 full year without flying, and flew for ten hours in one month (my instructor was so helpful

I was lucky to be able to take my checkride at my home airport (class E airspace and virtually no traffic)

The whole practical lasted from 800-1245.

We began by going over my IACRA and logbook

Then he began asking questions about the FAA special emphasis areas, and CARE. What is CFIT? What are some of the reasons that this happens? How can you prevent this from happening?)

He asked about what private pilot privileges and limitations were

We went over the maintenance logbooks, transponder, and ELT inspections (no Pitot-static/VOR inspections on the plane, because no IFR).

Then we moved on to my flight plan, but he did want to know how often METARs and TAFs were issued. After weather, we went over my weight and balance calculations, and my takeoff and landing distances.

We spent a lot of time talking about when the airplane is considered airworthy, and what to do if some equipment does not function (FAR 91.205, MEL, no MEL - 91.213(d), deactivate and placard INOPERATIVE). 

We went through typical airspace questions. (pointing and asking

Then we went over aeromedical factors. He asked for causes, and corrective actions for hyperventilation, spacial disorientation, and stress and fatigue. He asked me about the effects of alcohol and drugs (over the counter drugs too). He asked about flying after SCUBA diving (wait 12 hours if under 8000ft and no decompression stop. Otherwise, 24 hours, even if the cabin is pressurized).

Then he asked me about airplane systems. Tell me about the fuel system (what fuel

The oral continued as I did my preflight inspection (ie. what are the counterweights in the ailerons for?), which is a lot in a C152!) He landed, shook my hand, and gave me my temporary airman certificate!",,False,self,False,t3_1g62hk

“Let’s say you’re on the ground

I knew this one! I’d always been a bookworm and had read most of the Cessna 172’s Pilot’s Operating Handbook over the past few weeks.  This exact scenario had been in the chapter on emergency procedures.  I proudly showed off I’d [done my homework](http://imgur.com/3z20F):

“You continue cranking the engine

Gary looked at me.

“Are you insane?”

I was crushed. I hated letting him down.

“Really? I could have sworn-- let me find the page

“I know what it says. But here’s what I say. I’m in a metal tube surrounded by 40 gallons of gasoline, try to find a fire extinguisher.”

It seemed so reasonable when he put it that way.

“Here’s another one. Let’s say your engine has failed and you’re gliding in for a landing

“Maybe pull up

“No. You go through. Maybe the trees will rip the wings off and it’ll slow you down.  Maybe if the wings get left behind there will be less fuel at your crash site to catch on fire.”

That was definitely not anywhere in the manual.

“Listen

That conversation sticks out in my memory more than any other I had with Gary during the year he was my instructor. I bought my own plane a few months later, it isn’t even my machine. Some insurance company owns it.

It would be a few hundred hours before I’d be tested on if I’d really taken Gary’s advice to heart. Hour 355


**Hour 355 - Coast to Coast

In August of 2004 I embarked on the trip that most American pilots contemplate at some point: a trip from coast to coast -- the ultimate cross-country! My dad has always loved small planes and was excited to come with me.

My plan was to first cross the Rockies in Albuquerque, we’d take off from Long Beach and get fuel in Winslow, AZ; head east until the Rockies ended, then east-northeast and spend the night in Liberal, KS; stop for fuel on the 2nd day in Quincy, IL; spend the second night in Youngstown, PA; and finally reach Ticonderoga, putting together flight plans for every one

What a waste of time. Don't bother remembering any of those cities because we didn't stop in any of them after Winslow.

The night before the trip I packed all my bags and weighed everything. My big suitcase for 2 weeks away, a heavy box full of charts and approach plates, and all the other random odds and ends added up to nearly 100 pounds. With my dad and his small bag the plane was still 150 pounds below its maximum gross weight -- plenty of leeway.  Or so I thought.

The morning of the trip was hot. The temperature was in the 90s on the ground. I’d planned our first leg,000’ feet; those last few thousand feet, the plane was climbing just a couple hundred feet per minute.

Heading east we tracked directly over Interstate I-40. Looking down and seeing it was emotional. In 1998, driving nearly the full length of I-40 together until we got to L.A. I would never have believed that in a few short years, I'd be on an epic cross-country trip back East, 2 miles above that same spot, in my own airplane!

We passed over the [Colorado River](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40700035/photos/colorado.jpg), it was the ""Ford Motor Proving Ground"" -- perhaps a place to secretly test new cars, away from the prying eyes of competitors?  Another few hundred miles put us over [Sedona](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40700035/photos/sedona.jpg), where the scenery changed from flat and colorless to breathtaking. Ben and I stopped in Sedona to go swimming during our 1998 road trip, but I don't think I ever fully appreciated how beautiful it was until I saw it from above.

I didn't have much time to admire the scenery, Winslow airport sits almost 5,000 feet above sea level. Since the temperature was 90 degrees, the ""density altitude""---or, equivalent field elevation at a standard temperature---was reported at an alarming 8,100 feet! With such thin air, the performance of the engine is lousy since it is starved for air. Also, since there's so little air to keep it aloft just before it stops flying.

Luckily, but a ""greaser"" -- one of those landings where you're not sure that the wheels are even on the ground. (I was not able to repeat this flawless performance for the remainder of the trip.) As expected, the plane kept on rolling and rolling for a few thousand feet before finally coming to a stop. Just before touchdown, the GPS was indicating our groundspeed at about 100 knots, or 115 MPH. We taxied back to the self-serve fuel pumps and refilled our half-empty tanks.

I did my primary training in Santa Monica, and -- unfortunately for aspiring pilots -- its June Gloom.  Every year before summer gets into full swing, a cloud deck settles in every evening and doesn't budge until the following day's afternoon sun burns it off.  Technically called a ""marine layer,"" it extends inland about 1,000 feet off the ground, making visual-flight-rules flight impossible in a land full of skyscrapers, terrain and complex airspace.

In June of 2003 I was still training for my private pilot's license.  The last hurdle was the Night Cross-Country -- a 100-nautical-mile flight performed at night.  I'd scheduled such a flight with my instructor four times in two weeks

One gloomy June weekend I was scheduled to be in Las Vegas for a friend's 48-hour bachelor party.  As I was packing, I reasoned, was find a flight school, schedule a lesson, sneak out of the party for a few hours, and come back triumphantly, ready for my checkride.  Brilliant!

I found a flight school based at North Las Vegas airport and gave them a call.  ""Sure, a tiny untowered airport in the middle of the high desert about 75 miles away.

I arrived at the airport to find a 22-year-old kid wearing a colorful bandana and a lot of rings.

""Uh

""Yeah

I realized I'd been spoiled back home.  My primary instructor was on old guy: wise, but I was determined to press on.

We took off and steered our 172 through the Vegas Class B airspace, and there were no lights on the ground.  I clutched the sectional chart with a white-knuckle grip, knowing the high mountains were out there but that I couldn't see them.  What other unfamiliar dangers might be lurking in this strange land?

""So you're, right?  Have you been instructing here a long time?""

""No man, we're doin' fine.""

We made superficial small talk which did little to calm my nerves.  Finally, as it turned out: the short final leg plus the nighttime flying illusions caused me to badly misjudge the distance to the runway.  I was also afraid of the ground due to the total darkness and high terrain.  As a result, I kept coming in far too high and having to go around.  My anxiety level continued to climb.

Finally, I managed to fly a stabilized approach and landed with a squeak. As we taxied back to take off again, I noticed the midfield windsock was limp; the evening was totally calm and the deserted airport was dark and silent.

Holding short of the approach end

""It looks like the wind just came up a bit

""You sure man?  Looks right to me.""

I looked at the windsock again.  It was now pointing *towards* us

""Wait, mouth open, still mid-sentence.  

""It's going around in a circ-- I mean

Suddenly gravel and dust started swirling around us.  And, as a hundred metal garbage cans being beaten with hammers, the plane was rattling and heaving around us.  Losing his cool for the first time the instructor shouted -- barely audible over the racket -- **""DEATH VORTEX!""**

DEATH VORTEX!?  Did I hear that right?  Now in abject terror

The yoke whipped to and fro, crossing the hold-short line despite my desperate pleas with friction.  We pitched so far up and down that I feared the prop would strike the ground; in a panic, I quickly hit the master switch and pulled the mixture to stop the engine.

And suddenly it was over.

The wind stopped at the same moment the engine stopped.  In a surreal instant, saying nothing, listening to their gentle whir.

Finally

""I'm going to get out of the plane.""

""Yeah

We left the plane sitting where it was and walked to the edge of the taxiway.  It was on a bluff overlooking the casino.  We sat, our fears, our aspirations, and why we fly at all.  What we'd actually experienced was a ""dust devil"" -- a miniature tornado common in the desert during the summer.  We contemplated what might have happened if it had come along a few minutes earlier, when we were on final, or a few minutes later, just after takeoff.  Finally, wiser.

An hour later, I look back at that page and smile at the entry -- nothing but a little drawing of a tornado and a signature.

 Mine was causing (although I like to pretend it was ATC's fault!) a Ryanair 737 to go around very, so I went up for one circuit. Unfortunately, due to the traffic, I ended up being in the air for 45 minutes, flying [this](http://i.imgur.com/YeT6W.jpg) rather large circuit, following a PA28, being asked to orbit twice for long periods of time (pretty sure ATC forgot about me for quite a while) while a succession of Easyjet, Ryanair and FlyBe aircraft landed on runway 27. 

Finally there was a gap, at which point she asked me to fly a left base. Flying the base I set up the a/c for landing and slowed to 70 kts; only turning final did she inform me that there was a 737 on the approach behind me that had just called up only 5 miles out. 

She tells the Ryanair crew to slow to minimum safe approach speed, I had a bit of a brain fart and didn't actually land long, so I touched down near the TDZ and kept my speed up, desperately trying to vacate at E, but...

 ""Ryanair ____, I say again, go around, acknowledge"" - the irritation from the Ryanair guy's voice as he acknowledged was palpable!

 The sight was awesome, to say the least! When I got back into the flying school, my helpful chief FI was on hand to console me, telling me that ""We've got a Ryanair Captain on the phone, he wants your bank account details..."" 

 The annoying thing was that I was actually off the runway itself

1366006662.0,1cdisr,My First 'Emergency',godlyjack,55,5,29,"I saw a post like this earlier in the week and am so inspired to post my first incident in the air.

I got my PPL in early February but have barely been up due to the crazy March winds we had in the DC area. Yesterday I went up on my 2nd XC trip as licensed pilot in command with a friend of mine. There was an airmet for modereate turbulence, rubbed my fingers together, flexed my hand and all my fingers knowing it would be extra bad if I was having problems too. I wasn't, everything was fine. We weren't anywhere high enough for it to be hypoxia anyways, and the carbon monoxide indicator was indicating the air was fine. I didn't know what was going on so I added a few hundred rpm to get us on the ground just a little bit quicker. I tried reassuring him ""We're 20 miles out, going 100 knots, we'll be on the ground in just 10 minutes!"" Over the next few minutes it spread up his arms and his breathing became labored. It kept getting worse, his breathing got heavier, and decided to ask Potomac departure to arrange an ambulance to meet us at the airport. They asked 'What is the nature of your emergency?' I told them I had a passenger who had numbness in his hands and was having trouble breathing. Potomac was amazing and got the ambulance for us. Over the next ten minutes I kept reassuring him - we'll be on the ground in just a few minutes, Cessna _______ inbound straight in runway 27

Touched down and quickly taxied over to the ramp where the ambulance was waiting

As they took his vitals in the ambulance, they were all surprised to hear I was a freshly minted private pilot, they all had thought I was the instructor. And they were all very impressed with how I handled the situation, kept telling me how great I did, saying they knew a lot of PP's who would have panicked.

While it sucks that my friend didn't have a good flight (he was really enjoying the view until he started to feel 'weird'), and kept reassuring my precious cargo. I'm sure people have far more interesting stories than this; but for me, this was my real first pilot in command decision making, and I'm so proud of myself for the way I kept control of the situation. 

Fortunately my friend is perfectly okay. As he sat in the ambulance the tension in his upper body went away, haha. My non-medical opposite of expert opinion is that maybe it was just an anxiety attack. When I did small roller coasters when I was younger I would always tense up to the point of completely locking my body and not breathing as soon as the drop came, and that even happened to me early in my flight training. It was his first time in a small plane and there was a bit of up and down turbulence. My crappy flying probably didn't help any :D But in any event the important thing was that he's fine and can't wait to go flying again. How we got home is an entirely different story that unfolded over the next 8 hours....

The hoarfrost on all of the planes was ridiculous: crystals bigger than skittles covered all of the upper surfaces, and waited for every speck of ice to melt off.

An hour later it was time to go and sure enough the engine wasn't running great after sitting outside in the cold for &gt;5 weeks. At 1200-1300 rpm it was running rough (sounded like it mighta been missing)

I taxied onto the big runway and pushed the throttle full forward. Instantly

By the time I was stopped and talking to ground, but realized it would be hard for it to come through the intact cowl. While taxiing I'd watched it fade, almost like condensation - but how? 

Looking around, it dumped warm air onto the cold windshield which instantly formed a thick layer of fog. Whew! After closing that (and taxiing back and waiting for a wake turbulence delay) the take off and subsequent 2 hour flight was pleasantly uneventful.

Also, the material: I sat down and made a list of about 40 more chapters yet to tell.  Based on the average length so far, that would make it about 65,000 words, which is on the short side, but not bad for a memoir.

But more importantly, and re-reading years of archived emails I wrote years ago, exchanged with pilots right after some of these incidents happened.  It's been great fun, and even if no one reads the book, it will have been fun to write.  So thank you, reddit, for pushing me to embark on such a project.

You may remember me as the creator of /r/pilots over a year ago. I wanted to create a community centered around the art and joy of manned exploration of the air. After a little bit of ad spend and a lot of hustling the community quickly grew to over 500 pilots. Pics of weekend outings were shared, the community shared in our collective love for the art. 

Then, which involved a much greater monopolization of my time and change in my family budget. This basically clipped my wings, I moved away from the airport and had to stop flying. It didn't seem like I'd be able to fly again for some time. This made /r/pilots a source of pain for me. I'm ashamed to say my grief caused me to abandon the great community at r/pilots.

Fast forward to July 2012 I've discovered a new little airport nearby which I've fallen in love with. I've readjusted my budget to fit in a monthly outing in the plane. I'm scheduling my BFR today and am reinvigorated. Last night I decided to swallow my shame and punched /r/pilots in the address bar. And wow

I just wanted to say I'm sorry for disappearing and leaving /r/pilots unmoderated. More importantly I want to say thank you to everyone who is behind /r/flying. This is everything I wanted /r/pilots to be and more. I can't wait to contribute and be a part of the community.

- The [Verhees Delta](http://www.verheesengineering.com/gb/delta.html)

- The FlyNano, and a set of forward-swept horizontal stabilizers that meet the wings at the wingtips. You occasionally see concepts of airliners or cargo freighters using this configuration but I don't think I had ever actually seen a manned airplane with wings like that. And while [the CGI imagery on the terrible website](http://flynano.com/) makes it look like something that will never actually fly... It does fly! [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BZxOmQppw4#t=10s), [pictures](http://flynano.com/galleria/maidenflight.html).

- The [LH-10 Ellipse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sn-YnmGNcU#t=110s) looks like a two-seat BD-5. Only the nosewheel retracts

- The [Gyroflug SC-01](http://www.airteamimages.com/gyroflug-sc-01-speed-canard_D-ENWG_-private_130797.html) looks like an EZ, I would guess.

- If you mix the LH-10 with the SC-01

- Then there's this thing, [two](http://lfai.blogspot.com/2009/06/f-psck-chudzik-cc-02-part-2.html).) Apparently it has flown, but it doesn't exactly look like the most stable thing ever designed. But you gotta love the pointy nose, tandem seating in a bubble canopy, and the smooth sleek surface that makes it look like one big composite part.

- The [FanTrainer](http://www.airliners.net/photo/RFB-Fantrainer-400/1399557/&amp;sid=efddaabf9fee9a76409a5a4fcdb49404). Unlike the other airplanes on this list, ok... It [sounds as funny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkFZsz260cI#t=39s) as you'd expect.

- On the opposite end of the performance spectrum is the [WoopyFly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6CvycZux0E), i.e. even smaller and easier to transport than other trikes or ultralights (short of flying a paraglider with an engine strapped to your back). No, it does not appear to make farting noises. But this video of [some Japanese guys trying it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYlZ2GGk8HI#t=15s) is kinda hilarious

- And finally: France’s answer to the Icon A5 is the equally drool-worthy [Lisa Akoya](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rt7WEfLJbY). Also a two-seat amphib, in my opinion, and the cockpit looks even cooler. Ah, and it can carry little skis on the wheels (still retractable) and land in snow, for full tri-phibian action. More videos [here]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7PvOpk18Hg) and [here]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7PvOpk18Hg). Oh, and the wings fold up electrically! Fan-cee.

Of course, especially for people who might be getting bored with Cessnas, Pipers, etc.

Part 1
&gt;I just completed the first pilot training class on the 787 at United Airlines, with emergency after emergency, and the FAA observing. Tonight was our LOE (line-oriented evaluation), again with FAA - this time 2 FAA observers. It's 0200 and I just got back to the hotel and poured a well-earned glass of wine to celebrate. I now have a type rating in the 787. Phew. I'm pretty confident this will be the last one for me.
 


&gt;I've summarized some of the major differences and unique features of the 787 versus more traditional ""old school"" airplanes like the 777 (not kidding) - from the pilot's viewpoint. Our ""Differences"" course takes 11 days to gain an FAA type rating, and deemed it unacceptable. The FAA approved the Boeing 5-day course, but our guys decided it lacked too much information. FAA is observing our checkrides now, and taking our course as well, to certify the training. We're just the guinea pigs.
 


&gt;A computer nerd would describe the 787 as 17 computer servers packaged in a kevlar frame. The central brains is the Common Core System (CCS). Two Common Computing Resources (CCRs) coordinate the communications of all the computer systems, a few displays light up and you can start the APU. If there is a major loss of cockpit displays, this may require a CCR reboot, which would take about a minute. Here are a few of the major features and differences from the 777.
 


&gt;Electrics - Though a smaller plane, which provides refrigerated air for the galley carts and cabin air, and a Miscellaneous Equipment Cooling System for Inflight Entertainment Equipment.
 


&gt;If 3 of the 4 engine generators fail,000 feet. If you lose all 4 engine generators, the RAT (ram air turbine) drops out (like a windmill), powering essential buses. (It also provides hydraulic power to flight controls if needed).
 


&gt;If you lose all 4 engine generators and the two APU generators (a really bad day), you still have the autopilot and captain's flight director and instruments, FMC, 2 IRSs, VHF radios, etc. If you're down to batteries only, with no RAT, as battery time is limited. Brakes and antiskid are electric - 28V - so you don't lose brakes or antiskid even when you're down to just standby power.
 


&gt;Normal flight controls are hydraulic with a couple exceptions. Engine driven and electric hydraulic pumps operate at 5000 psi (versus normal 3000 psi) to allow for smaller tubing sizes and actuators, as is the stabilizer trim. You can still fly the airplane (no flaps, though). If you're having an even worse day and you lose all hydraulics and all generators, flight control power is still coming from separate Permanent Magnet Generators (PMGs) which produce power even if both engines quit and are windmilling. If the PMGs fail, too, your flight controls will be powered by the 28 V standby bus.
 


&gt;If you lose all 3 pitot/static systems or air data computers
 


&gt;If you lose both Attitude and Heading Reference Units (AHRUs)
 


&gt;If you lose both Inertial Reference Units
 


&gt;If someone turns one or both IRSs off in flight (I hate it when they do that)
 


&gt;There is no pneumatic system. The only engine bleed is used for that engine's anti-ice. Wing anti-ice is electric. Each of two air conditioning packs control two CACs, the remaining pack controller takes over control of all 4 CACs.
 


&gt;There are no circuit breakers in the cockpit. To check on them
 


&gt;If you have an APU fire on the ground or inflight
 


&gt;There's a Nitrogen Generation System which provides automatic full-time flammability protection by displacing fuel vapors in the fuel tanks with nitrogen (Remember TWA 800?).
 


&gt;Like the 767 and 777, heading, and altitude changes to the airplane. These show up on a second line right under the speed, heading and altitude displays on the mode control panel. If you pilot wants to use them, he can press a XFR button next to each window. The controller can even uplink a conditional clearance, like - After passing point XYZ, climb to FL390.

**Chase the lifestyle


The airlines are not necessarily where all pilots should aspire to end up. There is a **ton** of other jobs out there! Make sure you take the time and research what you want to be doing! Personally


What I do (stygarfield
I'm a full time float pilot on the southern coast of British Columbia. I work 4 days one week, including tons of travel perks, jumpseat agreements, restaurant discounts, etc... My company even has a C172 that it keeps maintained just for licensed staff to rent, we even have one of our employees completing their PPL on it! While I do not make as much as those flying the same aircraft in the bush - I much prefer this lifestyle to living in the far north!


Like I mentioned earlier, please feel free to ask away!

**From Iolar7000**
My considerations

**Job Security** - Can I buy a house and be reasonably sure I'll still have a job in this area in 5 years time. Will I have to move my kids aways from their school and friends because I've been made redundant and the nearest job is hundreds of miles away?

**Lifestyle Control** - How many days off do I get in a month

**Salary** - Can I afford to lead a decent lifestyle

**Job enjoyment** - Quite simply, just that the adrenaline rush he used to get lessened significantly. Ultimately what most people want at the end of the day is a job that they like a lot (if not love) but which will tick the boxes above.",,False,self,t5_2qm1t,1370363854.0,cpl,

ATC : brickyard 2450 turn left 330 climb and maintain 5000 (just departed handed off to approach for vectors out)

2450: up to 5000, do you have traffic for me?

ATC: brickyard 2450 traffic 1 o'clock 4000 southwest bound

2450: we just got an RA (plane telling them what to do) we are descending now. (moments later) PROVIDENCE

ATC: roger continue your climb to 5000 contact Boston center

I get shit from my friends and other pilots, and skiing, but I'm not going to wear one for flying, it ruins the experience."" That's fine, it's kinda like driving, you have safety harnesses, it feels safe in the enclosed cozy cockpit.

It's not. I have photos of a crashed 182 at Big Creek, but the combination of good shoulder harnesses could. The helmet lessens the severity of the side-impact.

I had a friend who crashed his '56 172 into terrain in idaho after flying up a terminal canyon. The wreckage was fairly intact

Numerous accounts exist of pilots who were rendered unconscious for a few minutes post-crash. Those minutes might be all you need for egress from fire. A helmet could make the difference depending on the severity of the crash. The forces involved in an air crash are immense, the CubCrafters Sport Cub I am flying has them. 

Why post about it? Because it's something I'd like to see become more popular in GA. Everyone knows that the aviation fraternity is a little on the older, but I feel a little better about crash survivability. I'm under the impression that we're a bit of a younger, more progressive pilot crowd on Reddit, so if you haven't given it any thought until now, look into it. Personally, I'm rather excited to plaster mine with stickers.

I have purchased a helmet for my wife as well. For other guest passengers with variable size heads

Thanks for reading.



EDIT: I'd like to address in my OP a commonly issued caveat that I've gotten in response to advocating several different types of safety devices, and of course, helmets. This is common not just to Reddit, but apparently in the thinking of pilots everywhere. The common argument, paraphrased, is: ""Don't let the use of a safety device affect your judgement or let you relax any vigilance that would be exercised without it.""

My response to that is:  I've been flying for 15 years; Not a long time by the measure of many, amidst completely unlandable terrain, one-way no-go-around strips surrounded by 80 ft trees, airstrips at the end of narrow and deep canyons, yada yada yada, I'm not the boldest but I'm not the oldest either. To get to some of those places, one has to simply accept that the consequences of an engine failure or simple shitty piloting will result in the worst. I continued anyway. I will continue to do so. So, but I'm already practicing an aviation lifestyle that is pretty unforgiving anyway, and will hopefully continue to be forgotten for the rest of my career.

Finally, don't. But there are some aviation-oriented options out there for people who would like to do so, FYI.

**TL;DR: I wear a helmet while flying light GA aircraft in hopes that it'll help me survive a crash that doesn't explode in a huge fireball upon impact.

2. Did any pilots question the legitimacy of what you were saying? Were they hesitant to divert and land?

3. How tense was the tower during and after the attacks?

4. Did any of the ATCs or yourself stop to watch the news? How were you informed otherwise?

5. Were you allowed to go home at your regular scheduled time

I actually did my first try at the checkride last Monday, which means that covering the DG also covers the Nav 1 CDI.  Unfortunately, I then proceeded to *completely* forget that the aircraft had a Nav 2 and a second CDI - the flight training device at my flight school doesn't have a second Nav, and the only time I'd ever used the Nav 2 in flight during training was for VOR checks.  Plus, most of my partial panel work was shooting partial panel RNAV approaches, where you can just use the CDI screen on the Garmin.  So I tried to fly my hold based on the GPS information, and the examiner busted me.

Went back out there today, I stayed under the hood while he gave me turn instructions (""turn left... stop turn"") and power settings, then told me when to flare, and we touched down right on centerline without ever lifting the hood up.  (I think he was helping out with the rudder to get me perfectly lined up, but still - pretty cool.)",,False,t5_2qm1t,True

The flight was equally ""quick"". We headed out to KTNT and did the [KTNT ILS 9](http://155.178.201.160/d-tpp/1305/05744I9.PDF) approach

I had a small challenge with the hold as there was some weather beginning to move in and started pushing me south (even with 30º of wind correction!) of the localizer.

My advice from this is: If you see your fuel gauges change quickly and read the opposite, not too common instrument readings that should get your gears turning?

TL;DR: Lost a fuel cap

Edit: Thank you all for the words of advice and good commentary! The remainder of the trip went off without a hitch (after we secured a replacement fuel cap). I am now home with a lesson learned in ADM and mid-flight-pre-flights!
