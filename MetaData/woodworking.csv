The problem is that I get very anxious when doing new things and it often keeps me from stepping out of my comfort zone. I have to be aware of every aspect of a new venture before starting. We've got a free-to-use shop on campus so that's covered. 

 The problem: I need to bring my own materials

I'm building a small organizer which I've rendered [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZPKcdj0.jpg) and I'm pretty sure all I need is like 6-7ft of 1x10 

TL;DR Could you describe your trip to go buy some wood? 


EDIT: ***** SOCIAL ANXIETY SHEESH ***** I didn't know what to call it and I figured the people on the woodworking subreddit would give me some slack. Dag, and I'm fine with that. I've gotten along this far and I'm usually pretty good about trying new things, but I think /u/DireTaco had a good description of exactly what was going through my head. 

Thanks for all the help! Oh

To the mean dude at the bottom: (aside from your actual description): I drew it in Solid Works while procrastinating for a class. I rendered it in two point perspective so that's why the lines aren't parallel. Don't be an asshole. Don't tell people what they have,False,self,t5_2qlqp,1370929266.0,,,t3_1g06dr

Well

Since this was going to be in the garage, I had friends dropping off pallets at the house...

One garage full of pallets...check! Easy to take apart, I decided to introduce Mr. Tiger saw to the pallet. Within an hour, I had all of my pallets cut up and boards separated. That saw was like a hot knife through butter. So, word to the wise, go the power tool route if you do this.

In my design phase, what to do... hmmm; 18 gallons of beer or 15 gallons of homebrew on tap. I went the route any homebrewer would go. :) And with that, I introduce you to my pallet kegerator build with four taps: http://imgur.com/a/HR0eF

It hangs on the wall and each of the tiles has 4 magnets.  I have a sheet of steel behind the canvas so the letters stay in place quite well.

my first accident. happened two days ago.
details:
was using rockler aluminum tapering jig http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=2076

i made four cuts, shredded it into shrapnel and fired it back into the palm of my hand.  i had glasses on and was standing outside of kickback zone- i was using a push stick to keep the piece i was cutting held down as well and pushing the jig handle with my left hand. it happened so fast i had no idea what happened until i looked at my hand, huge deep cut about 2"" deep 4"" wide. it severed the nerve to my middle finger which will heal in 4-6 mos. hand in cast for 6 weeks.

what i learned:

know the adress and location of closest ER. store it in your phone. know where your phone is
in my case my wife drove me because it was faster than having an ambulance come. we had to look for keys for what seemed like forever.
have first aid kit handy

ill never use anything metal between the fence and the blade ever again. unless it in the mitre slot.  its too dangerous. have at least 5"" clearance from the blade at all points of the cut. i didn't.

call me stupid if u like, i consider myself lucky.

This project was actually a set of experiments. First and foremost

You might remember me from such submissions like [While digging through the firewood pile...](http://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/pxuj3/while_digging_through_the_firewood_pile/). I continued to do do some digging. In fact

Not so long ago, finally got [something](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/7054698933/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/) I [liked](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/6908609542/in/set-72157629763219085/)
Achieved this by building up first a Dark Mission Brown, but under sunlight, the different colors come out at different viewing and illumination angles. BTW, this is the same firewood log I mentioned in my previous firewood post. The other new thing for me was the use of Walnut oil.

The final experiment was the finish. I have always liked using fresh shellac. But I recently thought to try wet sanding the final coat. After applying and applying walnut oil (the wood for the sides was *very* dry), I sanded until when wiped and viewed at a glancing angle, I could see no evidence of unsanded  glossiness. After wiping off the mineral oil, I polished with 0000 synthetic steel wool and paste wax and then buffed with a cloth. The smooth, glossy surface lets all the details of the [found, spalted wood](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/7054699799/in/set-72157629763219085) shine.  I love how people are drawn to touching the surfaces, to feel how smooth I got it.

Also added some unfinished [cherry dividers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ngp/6908608872/in/set-72157629763219085/lightbox/) inside. Unfinished because she wants to keep her loose tea in the box.
