That being said - I know several people who HATE it here. I know people who have changed into different people because of Tech, all thanks to GT. 

And it's not ""growing pains"" - nobody else cries out like this at UGA, too, hah). You don't hear stories of people literally shaking with test anxiety elsewhere.

So why is Tech different? Why are people being TORTURED here - why have I seen more than one of my cool

I've thought long and hard

In high school I got all A's - even with AP classes, always. The teacher loved you and would double-check things with YOU. The yearbook pins you as ""smartest"" - you were known school around as the smart kid who would go somewhere off his/her smarts.

I was all these things, I said in a modest response to a ""oh how do you do it I never got grades like this"" question: ""I work hard for this - this is the main thing I do - if I didn't get A's, it would be pretty embarassing."" 

My older sister overheard me. She said ""Well ____, ""Yeah, sure, I guess..."" 

""How about your friends - people like you; you make people laugh

I reply along the same lines ""I mean, the academics are the real triumph.""

Then comes the salient line of the whole story (for all 2 people who reach here):

""I know... but don't let grades be WHO YOU ARE. Something like that changes too easily to be such a big part of your identity...""

My sister is an Asian Studies major at Belmont University. She'll be graduating this Fall and plans to teach kids Hindi or something like that. Stop laughing

Kids here... a lot of them were ""nerds"" or outsiders...the social development in high school was lacking. I don't think anyone can deny that. The only piece of identity they have is as ""the brain"". They come here... and their identity is completely compromised. They are a failure

Having your identity destroyed is a VERY VERY powerful and damaging thing. And that's exactly what happens to a lot of people at this school - I see it time and again.

TL;DR People here make ""getting good grades"" the centerpiece of their self-actualization story and then GaTech writes them a sequel where the first book was all a fluke and the protagonist is actually worthless because they can't get good grades anymore.",self,t5_2r8t2,1367437035.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1dhhy7/the_reason_why_people_are_miserable_here/

Winded and waiting for ATL cops. Thank you GT police for being so prompt. We got the get away vehicle's plates so hope they catch them and we're a little safer on GT

EDIT:

IMG link: http://i.imgur.com/sr7fs2i.jpg

Normally never walk through Home Park with my phone out in order to avoid situations like this but was texting my friend about what workout we were going to do at the gym when the guy ran up behind me and snatched it from my hands. He started running away while shouting ""Fuck you motherfucker"" and my first reaction was to run after him. Was nearly at 14th and State at the time he snatched it.

Ran down 14th, and ended up Atlantic. Saw two guys standing on the corner who were chatting it up so yelled at them to call the police b/c the guy stole my phone. Instead, they joined in on my chase. The guy who stole my phone turned and saw 3 people chasing him so he threw my phone behind him. One of the guys in front of me caught it and gave it back to me. Guy who tried to rob me must have been as winded as I was and was walking away at this point. 

Two guys pull up in a car on Atlantic and tell me that they saw everything that happened and that they'll help me follow the guy and to jump in. Get in their ride and call police while the passenger, tell it to police, and they speed off. About 30 seconds later 2 GT police come screaming down Atlantic in pursuit. I start filing reports.

Thanks to everyone that helped me recover my phone. Went back in search of headphones and stopped by the house of the guys that helped me. Justin

To start, so as a sort of publicity stunt for the school and the group, we decided to try to come up with a way to get him to come here and speak. We're in the process of writing a bill to SGA asking for money, and to help supplement that we're trying to amass signatures of people who'd be willing to pay to come see him in order to prove that many tickets would be sold. 

So to help, share, etc. Also, people from SPS will be on Skiles walkway at various times from now til friday when we submit the bill. So keep an eye out for us, and if you wanna help us out and want to see Neil Tyson, definitely come sign the petition. I think most of us can agree it would be a pretty awesome opportunity if we actually pulled it off!

Even if you have a permit: parked in the wrong area? That'll be $25.
Don't have a permit but want to study on campus late at night and choose the wrong lot to park in? That'll be $50. Did your meter expire? That'll be $25. Did you stay in the lot for 3 hours and 1 minute? That'll be charged for 4 hours.

I've been told that the Parking and Transportation department doesn't receive state funds

It's a shady business and I wish more people hated them as much as I do.

EDIT: For those saying that whining online won't help, and misinformation about what lots are open late at night. I voted with my wallet, I didn't buy it again this year and generally park off-campus and walk/bike to campus. But, there are nights where the conditions aren't safe to walk from certain areas or, hell, maybe it's a torrential downpour. This school should provide a reasonable system for parking for the safety and convenience of its students; the objective of Parking and Transportation should be to facilitate our needs, not destroy our wallets. As someone stated below

So here's to whining. Clearly some people agree. If enough people whine

You spend a hundred or two hundred bucks buying the product yourself (**WARNING FLAG!**). You then resell it your friends and associates all over campus and make money. You bring your friends into this scheme

Can you make money this way? Yes, the drive, the social network to sell any quantity of the product or bring any number of friends into the scheme. If you're one of the 999 in a thousand, you're going to buy a couple hundred bucks of the product, sell a few dozen, and end up in the red. You simply don't have the connections necessary to make it work. Is it a scam? Not in the traditional sense, but it's a lot like the beer commercials that suggest you will have women crawling all over you if you drink a certain brand. They're overselling the potential, and aren't asking you to invest hundreds of dollars.

Think about it: if these people are trying to sell, why wouldn't they just market it the same way Red Bull and Monster do? Why wouldn't they get their product into Kroger and Walmart and make a million bucks? Spoiler alert, they're not a charity: they've figured out that their product isn't viable through conventional marketing, and the only way they're going to make money is by selling it to naive college kids who think they're going to turn a profit when in reality they'll never recoup half the money they sink into it.

**tl;dr Multi-level marketing makes a very small number of people rich by screwing over a very large number of suckers underneath them. If you're asked to spend your own money to buy into a sales job

1) Use the damn search bar. In the words of one Tyler Durden, whether or not to take your AP credit, campus involvement, Greek life, employment, co-oping, etc. have probably already been asked and answered. Look for those questions before asking a different one.

2) You will have time to speak with an advisor when you come to orientation. They will tell you what classes to take. In the mean time, they have a list of requirements for your major that you should follow.

3) On the same note of classes, regardless of which FASET session you come to. The way that the system is set up is that while a class may hold 150 seats, only 25 will be opened up at each session so that kids who come to later sessions get an equal shot at each class. The only thing that will allow you to ""beat the system"" here is registering earlier in the session, which, btw, is entirely random as to who is allowed to register when. I've been an orientation leader twice, I promise you that I know how this stuff works.

Hopefully following these tips will make your life for the next few months a little easier. We're excited to have you coming to Tech and look forward to you being here in the fall.

That's fucking bullshit. Listen very carefully,  to know when each and every exam is, and to utilize every resource in your power to come even close to succeeding. You will go through a hundred impossible scenarios and still come in far from being able to answer that question on that one exam where the professor could have given less shit about you.

Sure, if you don't have the willingness to put in the strength and dedication that it takes to succeed, you will not make it. But if you do, there is nothing in life that will fucking stop you from tackling the future with a tenth of the effort you put in here.

But you think you have it bad? Look around you. Please, when your sheer willpower could push you to bigger and better places. You’ve fucking got this.

Like I said, chapter and word the professor sent out. It told me that the half-effort I had put in through highschool simply wouldn’t be enough. You’ve grown up living a lie if you think high school was hard. You need to buckle up and actually figure this shit out. The spoon-fed bullshit is over. This is real life.

Georgia Tech told me that studying would not be enough, and all I can say is thank you.

Thank you all for helping me push through this school when all else was against me. Thank you for helping me keep going. For all of you who are fighting the tough fight, keep pushing forward. Don’t let anybody stop you from succeeding. Push away from every single distraction, the end of the road is fucking worth it.

I know that when I look in the eyes of another Georgia Tech graduate, together. We have defeated the roughest of times, and we have what it takes to succeed. There are very few institutions out there that come even close to this privilege. Don’t take it lightly. However many years you spend here will change your life forever once you’ve graduated.

Thank you all. My undergraduate career has been a phenomenal ride,False,self,t5_2r8t2,False,,Computing,t3_1diblg

Have an interview for a full-time, especially if you have to drive through Atlanta. Also, if you're going to be more than 30 minutes late, call and cancel the interview (you should call regardless, but an hour is too excessive). Give your excuse and request an interview for a later date. Folks aren't sitting around at work just waiting to interview you, they're more than likely squeezing you into their schedule.

My 3DS has been found as of 1:20pm! Apparently it fell out of my bag at work (in Tech Square) and a coworker of mine found it and put it on my desk (but never emailed me or anything about it).
So I woke up extremely early this morning to get to the lost and found. No one had seen it. I had emailed the dean, a TON of people. I put up flyers all in Klaus. Now i have to take those down lol

**CoC**

 * How it was  done - Took the stairway closest to Klaus (backside of building). Door was not locked at the top.

 * Ease of Access - N/A only once

 * Worth it? - Lots of fun. Better view of Frats from Klaus.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Klaus**

 * How it was done - Took a stairway with roof access. Have to go through door at the top.

 * Ease of Access - This was good. Now the door is frequently locked.

 * Worth it? - Yes! Good view of everything.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Van Leer**

 * How it was done - Took the stairway closest to Bunger Henry. Again ... door at top.

 * Ease of Access - Have never seen this door locked. Apparently this has been locked frequently (thanks to studio_sally).

 * Worth it? - Good views. Some radio towers. All in all worth it.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Howey**

 * How it was  done - I have only been to the very top to look from the telescope.

 * Ease of Access - I beleive access is *very* restricted. Good luck. Look into astronomy club. Also Bruce1337 says ""Scaled the outside wall, once you climb up, it's an easy stairwell descent.""

 * Worth it? - Viewing the telescope is the only way to access the roof (I believe) and is definitely worth it.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**North Ave Apartments East (xCruise)**

 * How it was done - ""You can get on top of east by going up to the top of the stair case and using a credit card to open the lock. Then you have to crawl out a little access door and you can walk around."" 

 * Ease of Access - Sounds a little difficult but can be unlocked easily.

 * Worth it? - ""Best view of atlanta on campus imo""

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Student Center**

 * How it was done - Second floor balcony -&gt; jumping stairwell. Bruce1337 says ""The jump from the second story stairwell is more of a step to the roof. It's about | -------- | this far of a gap between the roof and the the stairwell. For anyone that can't picture what part of the student center

 * Ease of Access - Sounds easy

 * Worth it? - Never done. Imagine you can see the Coke building. Again thanks to Bruce1337 "" The view is sub-par

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Alexander Coliseum** Thanks to TenTypesofBread


 * How it was done - ""Hopped a fence

 * Ease of Access - ""harder than the others

 * Worth it? - ""Beautiful view of campus and surrounding area. Potential for trespassing charge... you decide""

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Bobby Dodd Stadium** Thanks to TenTypesofBread

 * How it was done - ""sneak into stadium (easy). dont get caught (harder). Climb side bleachers to the top, especially during spring semester, by jumping down from the Bursar's office staircase....""

 * Ease of Access - ""Easy to access

 * Worth it? - ""beautiful view

 * View from top - [Panaroma](http://i.imgur.com/6M7uo.jpg) thanks to wadamw


**Brittain Dining Hall** Thanks to hypotheticalquestion

 * How it was done - ""Be friends with any one of the stoners working there... plus, go up the small staircase to the 2nd level, and from there you can get to the abandoned belfry, which is pretty cool.""

 * Ease of Access - Sounds pretty easy

 * Worth it? - Maybe the BoA?

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Ford Es&amp;T/BMED Building** Thanks to hypotheticalquestion

 * How it was done - ""Take the staircase from Ford ES&amp;T facing Ferst and climb to the top

 * Ease of Access - Sounds hit or miss

 * Worth it? - Baseball fields and track. Maybe the BME quad too.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**MDRC** Thanks to friendlysockpuppet

 * How it was done - ""It's the tan building with all the round parts on it,38.583984&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=33.777038,-84.400454&amp;spn=0.001625,0.002473&amp;z=19).  Haven't done this myself, but if you go up the stairs on the outside of the northern most round part there's a gate a the top that you can just shimmy through if you're skinny enough (nicknamed the roof the skinny club, but you don't have to  be ridiculously skinny).  The stairs go right past a bunch of offices, so be sure to do it on off hours

 * Ease of Access - Easy

 * Worth it? - ""Like I said

 * View from top - No picture provided

Hey Everyone!! I just met with Dean Stein and I think it went over very well. This is going to be very long message so bear with me. I want to start out by saying that this is NOT whatsoever a debate or discussion arguing the ethics of pro life versus pro choice (as we have individuals on this group and campus who are both, Justice For All, is legally allowed to put their display in areas that aren't the designated free speech area due to the fact that they were sponsored by GT Students for Life, which is a Georgia Tech chartered organization. Any comments or discussions regarding what I have said above are pretty unnecessary because what we stand for is irrelevant to that. If you have any concerns on the above, make your own group! That being said, I brought to him my concern of psychological risk associated with the nature of the campaign. Psychological triggers of the graphic and unavoidable aspect of the campaign may cause an individual to commit harm to themselves, regardless of if you believe it shouldn't (if you don't have psychological triggers, and present a risk and reliability factor to our campus.

- If programming is new to you, like you've done your whole life. For example: If ""num"" is some number, and ""vec"" is a vector, know that ""temp = vec(num)"" takes the num-th position of vec and ASSIGNS it to temp. This is known as indexing. You may as well have been reading the dictionary and learned a new word. Stop thinking computing is some kind of esoteric concept reserved for nerds. Oh and for the love of God, assignment is from right to left.

- Along the same lines, and it's just a stepping stone to graduation. (Probably the latter)

- When starting a new problem, and prototype your algorithm. For example: I have a rack of shoes, but I got drunk last night and for some reason I decided to reorder them so I have no idea where anything is. Today, I'm feeling my wingtips, how might I go about finding them? I'll START at the beginning of the rack, and ask myself, is this pair my wingtips? IF not, I'm done. I'll perform the check for EVERY shoe on the rack...hey

- When going through examples, and that thing called the internet. I've Googled my way to an A in most classes, including this one.

- If anyone offers to work in groups on homeworks, and someone always has a source for the ""answers"", usually ill-begotten from someone who actually gives a damn about the class. It's not too say you shouldn't work with other people, which I will endorse if the process is mutual learning, but don't mooch. Do your own homeworks, learn how to ""think"" like a programmer. You can do it. 

EDIT: As per Waffuls
&gt; And for god's sake, learn the solutions, and you could probably get at least a B without even really understanding wtf is going on.

EDIT2: By i_never_lol
&gt; My #1 advice: Don't listen to all these fearmongers.

I'll leave this here before it becomes a rant

I have recently overhauled my wardrobe a little by following some advice from [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice)  and searching former asksubreddit posts, but mostly I've spent the past couple of weekends alone in my room or walking out and about because I am clueless about clubs/bars that I can get to without a car. Even if I did, I don't know people to go with. It seems like being in a frat, would have been a great option to have something to do on weekends, but I am 2 semesters away from graduation, and it's a rather fucking lonely place to be. 

Most of my attempts at talking to girls are epic fail too. I have been on a grand total of 2 dates this semester, or they are taken or the others I don't want to mess up the social friendship/acquaintance thing that I have going. In my classes, seems like everyone has their own groups, so I feel alienated in the class. And the only other place that I see girls that I'd be interested in talking to are at the CRC which I made a pact with myself not to do. Mostly because I'd much rather do my workout and let the girls do theirs besides I couldn't engage in such behaviour because if I were a girl, I'd probably think of the guy as creepy? Unless they know each other which seems like the norm for all frat/sorority people at the crc or in classes/etc. 

Anyway my life seems to be in a funk and I am not even sure why I am studying to be an engineer anymore. I am unsure about life post graduation as the limited (two) summer internships that I've had have lead me to believe that I fucking hate my guts working on some stupid analysis and optimization stuff. 

TL:DR -&gt; I am fucking down and out and on the verge of what might be depression? plus I am clueless about life now. looking for your thoughts and suggestions and wisdom. Thanks.
