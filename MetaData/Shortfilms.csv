To coincide with this emphasis on proper titling we're introducing genre flairs! It's simple; after you submit your video, please do your bit. Inevitably, there will be films that don't necessarily fit with the list of genres provided but do your best to pick the most appropriate one. In none are applicable, shoot the mods a message and we can allot a new genre flair as and when required (so long as it's not too obscure).

You might also spot that there is an Amateur Film tag available as one of the flairs. While this sub doesn't explicitly ban student films, think long and hard about whether or not this subreddit is really the place to post it.

That about covers the main changes

Hey ho

The types of post that lack this information tend to be a certain kind of submission, but that subreddit exists for amateur film makers to post their shorts and receive constructive feedback. In my opinion, I think it would be better to see this sub as a place for more ""professional"" films while /r/shortfilm could cater for more amateur fare. To that end, I've added emphasis for that in the sidebar in the hopes of gently nudging potential submissions in that direction.

A couple of months ago - I believe it was summer - I saw a then-new short movie that I can't find anymore. The plot went as follows:

In the postapocalyptic future, once more, the girl gets angry and her arm transforms into machinery. It is revealed that the consciousness of the girl who's angry at the guy is the reason for the apocalypse. In the end, the guy manages to calm the girl down.

That's all I remember. It would be neat if you guys could direct me to that movie again. Thanks!",self,t5_2qh76,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Shortfilms/comments/14jzdm/looking_for_a_short_film_humans_fight_robots_in/
