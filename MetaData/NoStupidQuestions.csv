As I understand it

After some time of pre-drinking

At the club people queue outside and have a chat while waiting. Upon being granted entry I think people tend to head to the bar for a drink.

After this I'm not sure what's supposed to happen. Some people dance, I'm curious what they get out of the experience, it's too loud to talk properly.

After a few hours I generally feel uncomfortable that I've been repeating the same few actions over and over and decide to leave.

Is the shared experience of music the main aspect? I hear a lot of people saying it's bad.

Are most guys trying to pull girls? In that case, to go up to strangers and start interacting with them?

Man real life is hard. I could totally master it if it were a computer game.

Right, pretty good... The only problems were that I wasn't able to cum (from a handie or blowjob) unless it was me doing the jerking, so to speak. Also; whenever we attempted sex, I would try to put the condom on but my dick had gone down while trying to put it on. I thought it was just beginners nerves or whatever, but 10 months on I still have the same problems!
I partly attribute it to the condom being fiddly as fuck to get on, I will attempt to not masturbate. Now, this will probably prove challenging so I'd like to know if anyone has any real confirmation that it will make a difference. If this is the only factor in both problems then I'm happy to stop, but I need to know because I've attempted it a couple of times before and found it quite difficult.
I hope someone can tell me the answer to my problems

Does it:

* Increase stamina and/or lower sensitivity

* Increase sensitivity

* Take effect instantaneously or periodically or something  like that

* Sustain the erection after ejaculation

* Have any negative side effects

* Cause the whole ""4-hour-long-erection-thing"" that commonly

* Require you to have a prescription or is it over-the-counter

* Have any real benefits when taken by women

* Have any competition - I think it is Cialis (?) Are they basically the same?

* Act the same universally or do some experience different results than others

I really don't want to bring the dog with us for a number of reasons. We're moving from the desert to a greener state. We pretty much don't have neighbors, but not when I can't stop her.
