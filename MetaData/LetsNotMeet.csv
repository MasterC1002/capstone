She used the house phone to call the police and immediately drive to the end of the driveway. The lady ended up being investigated but continued to claim that it was a break-in. After some time

This was I believe a Saturday and my dad was at work.  My Gram decided to take me to McDonald's for lunch and, order our lunch, and sit down at a table to eat.  At the time we were the only ones eating inside.

About 10 minutes after we sit down, and sits down at the table diagonally in front of us to the left.  The area we lived in was middle and upper middle class, so this guy looked pretty out of place.  Gram had her back to him but I could see him perfectly.  This man was at least in his mid 50's, with really wirey/scraggy and dirty white hair and beard.  He had on blue shorts and a white T-Shirt, also kinda dirty, and sandals.  It's amazing, this happened 21 years ago and I can remember it like it was yesterday.

So, this man had something dark pink and wrinkly on his lap, and he kept glancing at me and rubbing it every few seconds.  In kindergarten, we learned about stranger danger and ""good touch, bad touch"" and learned which parts of our body people weren't supposed to touch.  It clicked, in my 6 year old head, that this man was *not* supposed to have that out like that

I got really queasy and nervous.  I didn't want to tell my Gram right then and there because I thought the man would hurt us (if my dad had been there I would've said something because my dad was my hero and could take on anybody).  Instead, but I just shook my head and quietly said ""I wanna go home.""  Gram cleared our table and we left.

When we got home, go on to your room and play and I'll take care of it.""  She wiped my tears, gave me a blueberry Kool-Aid Burst, and told our dog, Patches, to go to my room with me, which she did.

After I was out of earshot, who showed up in record time, and arrested the guy.  When the police told the man to stand up, his frank and beans were still hanging out of his shorts.  The manager also told Gram that she could bring me back for a months worth of coupons for free Happy Meals.

I have another story about a weirdo that happened a few years later and this time my dad *was* there and believe me

1362462907.0,19oxoc,Dr. Ramsey,sweetmercy,1846,223,333,"I recently replied to a post on Askreddit about scariest experiences

A week or so before my 10th birthday

""Hi!"" he said

I walked along silently, because he kept right on chattering. 

""Are your parents looking for a pediatrician for you? Of course, won't you? That's okay though. They can still bring you to me until then. What's your name? You have beautiful hair. I was just on my way to get some suckers for the candy jar in my office. Do you like suckers?""

Thankfully, up the back steps and into through the kitchen door. I didn't know it then, but that was the beginning of a very long, very scary ordeal. It didn't take long after that for ""Dr. Ramsey"" to begin showing up. At first, it seemed benign enough...at least to a kid. He would drive by nearly every day, smiling and waving. I told my mom, who said maybe it was on his way home from work. But then

My dad called me into the living room, but that I needed to tell him the truth. I told him know, and he asked if I was sure...could I be forgetting something? I told him know again, and he frowned, then asked ""Then how does he know your name?"" I didn't know. 

It turns out, neither of us knew what he was saying. Then, one night, one of my brothers told us that he was telling my parents that he was going to hurt me (and later, my sister). 

Things got complicated after that. My dad had called the police, who happened to be a cop. For the next month, my dad's friend escorted me to and from school. Suddenly, life as I knew it came screeching to a halt. I couldn't walk to school alone, I couldn't play outside, I couldn't walk to SuperAmerica (sort of like a 7-11 for those who don't know). 

When access to me was completely denied, my mom and I were in the kitchen. One of my brothers saw a glimpse of someone in the garage; they'd seen him too. Dr. Ramsey came bolting out of the garage, my brothers chasing after him. They ran all the way to Cherokee Park, where he lost them in the trees. My parents called the police again, but nothing came of it. The only information they had was a description and a name that was almost certainly fake. 

A couple weeks later, and ruled it accidental, but none of us believed that. 

His phone calls became more informative in the meantime. He would talk about who was home, and about the french doors that connected the living room to the side porch and how the lock could be finagled from the outside if you jiggled it just right. That night, my dad put in some carpenter nails at the bottom of the french doors until he could get a new lock ordered.

My parents had to go to a company event for my dad's work. My older brothers were at Saints West roller skating rink. My sister was on the phone with her best friend. My little brother was on the floor asleep. I was watching Devo on the Midnight Special with Wolfman Jack. It was late. Suddenly, I could see his silhouette. My sister whipped the phone at the television, and we ran up the stairs. About halfway up, we realized our little brother was still asleep on the living room floor. As quietly as we could, we slipped back down the stairs to get him. We all went into our bedroom and didn't turn on the light; this way we could see outside. We watched out the window for a while, and when we didn't find him, we crept down the hall to our brothers' room to look. We looked down and could see someone standing at the backdoor. He knocked

""What do you want?"" my sister asked out the window. He stepped back and said ""Is this the Mercy residence? I have a pizza for delivery. Can you come to the door?"" 
She scoffed at him, and she was calling the cops. He left. 

A short while later, and things settled down. By now we'd pretty much given up calling the cops because it never helped, so we just went back in, each of us (except my youngest brother, still asleep) carrying a knife from the kitchen ""just in case"". Eventually, one of my brothers went into the kitchen to get a bowl of cereal as a snack. 

You know that sensation you get when you can just *feel* someone watching you? Yeah, at the windows. He didn't see anything, but he could still feel eyes on him, so he went closer to the door to try to see better. The kitchen lights were reflecting on the windows of the door (it had 3 rows of 3 windows), so he still couldn't see. He stepped closer, then closer again, until he was right up to the door, smiling back at him. He turned to yell for my older brothers

The next night we were at the table playing crazy 8's, ""BOOM BOOM BOOM!"" on the window right behind him. In the chaos, the two eldest ran out, but he was already gone. 

A couple of weeks later, smiling and waving. He called my name, and I ran to the teacher and told her. The school had been told all about him, and she took me inside right away and called my mom. That same day my mom had gotten a call from the school office asking her to verify that my dad was picking me up, as he'd called to say he was on his way. He wasn't. 

Not long after that, sitting alone in the dark, was my dad. On the table, a gun. He was tired of the the police waiting until Dr. Ramsey ""tried something"", he was tired of his children being terrorized, he was tired of being afraid every time he left for work that something would happen to us while he was gone. I sat with him for a time, watching

These events, as suddenly as it began, it was over. He had vanished from our lives; the phone calls, the drive-by with the creepy waves, everything. For a long time, during and after the Dr. Ramsey days, I would have a recurring nightmare in which I would wake up to find him standing over me as I slept. It took a long time before I felt like a kid again. 

I found out years later that when he was calling, locked in prison, in a coma...but sometimes I wonder if the wait ended for my dad when he was sitting in the darkened kitchen one night. I don't know, and I'm not sure I want to.",,False,,False,t3_19oxoc

It was about April 2007 when this happened. I had just come out of a painful divorce, trying to reach out to anyone I could, but I had severe codependency issues that I didn't know how to address. Anyway, I found myself wandering the games section of my local Wal-Mart, as I am still a gamer at heart, and had to see what was available. Things were going all right, and I seemed to be in control of myself.

Then he appeared. 

This poor, thinking I could make a friend, a new friend that hadn't been taken from me. We made casual jokes and talked about the new expansion (I can't remember if it had just came out, or if it was soon to come). At this point, his mother (he was probably about 18-20, judging by his appearance) came by and took him to another aisle. He didn't say goodbye, he just walked off, our conversation was through.

Well, twisted state, I thought he would appreciate it if we hung out for a while. 

So I followed him. 

I made a point to casually stroll down the aisles that he happened to visit, I can't remember. I could tell he was getting creeped out by the third time I had done this. He started getting this deer in headlights look every time he saw me, and it was starting to become a horror story, though in my eyes, it was perfectly natural. 

At some point, because when I appeared, as soon as I opened my mouth to speak, he screamed ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" and stormed off, dragging his mother as quickly as he possibly could. 

This was a wake-up call for me

I checked myself into a mental institution soon after, and a loving fiancee.

1333695602.0,rvzaq,The Smiling Man,blue_tidal,1366,144,170,"About five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I've always been a night person, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.

I spent four years like that

It was a Wednesday, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot.  The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.

I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each ""box"" with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.

Deciding he was probably drunk, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.

I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side

I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again

Once I had put about half a block between us, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn't tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.

I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.

I'd like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all

And then he stopped again

When I finally found my voice, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, ""What the fuu…?""

Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, smiling.

And then, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn't moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.

I ran too.

I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.

At an Aunts party my sister comes up to me and says that she thinks someone has been coming into her house in the middle of the night. 
My sister has always been easily scared

I asked her how she knew someone had been in the house
She told me she hadn't seen anyone
She then went on to explain that she has a sky box downstairs that streams to her bedroom television

I still didn't really buy what she was saying, i took my younger brother along just to be safe.

In all, me and my brother were convinced she was going crazy. Me and my brother decided we had stayed long enough and told her that we had to go home, she got extremely upset about this. 

I reassured her and told her to call the police the next time it happened

Two days later she called me at 11:30PM, i could tell from her voice.
I called my brother and told him to meet me at her house

When i got there my brother was parked up outside, my sister noticed that we went quiet and started asking what was wrong and if we could see him.

I told her to stay quiet and that we had it in hand
We couldn't see anything downstairs

We opened the patio door and ran up the stairs and caught the guy with his ear to her door. We kicked the shit out of him and got my sister out of the house

The cops came maybe 10 minutes later (he could have killed her if he wanted too.) which is fucking outrageous. It turns out the guy was one of our moms old boyfriends who had lived with us for a while in the 90's. He had always been fond of my sister but we had never suspected it to be him

1361483305.0,18za14,"My female ""friend"" turned into a stalker and creeper",babyhugbears,1294,164,90,"This is a tale about a friend I used to have years ago. Her name was Sara and I met her in the 7th grade. Back then

It wasn't until I moved back into my mother's house at the age of 19

Now, glasses, and same height (she was a few inches taller than me, but nothing to really brag about) and weight. Her hair color was more blonde compared to my brunetteness and had blue eyes while I have brown eyes. Back to the story. 

This takes place a few months after I had given birth. Nothing major had happened between me and her yet

I had started dating a new guy named Josh. Sara was actually the one that introduced us two because Josh was a good friend with her boyfriend, but still spent a lot of my time with Sara. She didn't take to this very well, and tried causing problems for me and Josh. After having a sit down with Sara, telling her I wasn't giving up our friendship but neither was I going to push a guy I really liked away. She seemed to have gotten the message and backed off. 

Shit hit the fan shortly after Josh and I moved into an apartment together. Sara demanded to spend more time with me while Josh was at work. I really had no problem with it, so we simply started not going out. I tried talking to her, but she kept saying if I was a real friend, I wouldn't mind her being there all the time. 

Well, because of the strain Sara caused us, we had a hard time enjoying each other. I refused to end my relationship with him and we tried hard to work it out. We tried talking to her boyfriend, Rob, asking if he could help us. He said they were planning on getting an apartment together at the beginning of the following month (she was still living with her parents at this point), but told us it was looking like it was going to be in the same complex as us. I could deal with that, figured she would want to spend time in her new place

Also note, she had dyed her hair to the same color as mine and gotten it cut the exact same way. I didn't really mind too much, it was a pretty sweet haircut, but both Josh and I couldn't get over how weird it was we were looking like twins. She even got colored contacts to wear under her glasses that changed her eyes to the color of brown. Like me. 

One night later that week, ""You know she is jealous of your life right? She's even got a huge crush on Josh and *you*."" I really had no idea. She didn't say anything about it to me, and I had no idea she harbored feelings like that for me. She's had many different boyfriends over the years. 

After that, more alone time with just Josh. On one of these nights, she tried to kiss me. Now, I have no problem with someone being gay. I have many other friends who are, but I am not, and everyone knows it. I like guys way to much. I told her this and she went crazy. Told me I was a lying cunt, that I was leading her on, I didn't

I filled Rob in on what had happened, though I don't think either of us really did much sleeping. 

The next day, but he has a job to do I guess.) 

When Sara learned that wasn't working, but I knew it was her. From my window I could see into her apartment and always saw her looking out at my window while on the phone. On the phone the exact times my phones were ringing. I quickly changed my phone numbers and that was the end of that day. No one besides my mom and work had them and neither cared for Sara much after learning what she had done. 

When she realized she couldn't get a hold of me via phone

However, but on the dining table. My favorite shirt had gone missing. Cordless phone across the room from where I last remember setting it down. I thought I was simply losing it and misplacing things. (I am a bit scattered brain, but not that much.) This went on for two or three weeks until bigger things were missing. My son's DVD player, my keyboard, cellphone charger, bath soap, towels

Naturally

They knocked on the door. She opened it wide enough for them to see the wall behind her. On this wall was hundreds of photos of me, etc. It wouldn't have been so creepy if it weren't for the fact that she wrote in big letters with red paint ""Die [my name] you fucking cunt."" It covered some of the photos and the wall. 

The police were able to search her place. They found journals full of her writing saying how she wanted to kill me, it was the same every week) and on a certain day she had it circled and marked as ""Kill Day."" Police found an unregistered gun and a huge knife. She was arrested. 

I promptly moved out and back into my mother's house. I found a new job and changed my appearance. I cut off contact with all our mutual friends (not tha twe had many) and found a new job. I haven't seen or heard from her in 3 years now. For all I know,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_18za14

I had just gotten off work, a woman about my age approached me looking nervous and scared.  She said that she had been at her boyfriend’s house, and they’d had a fight.  She’d walked to the gas station to use the pay phone and call a friend to pick her up.  On her way to the station, a car pulled up as she was walking and the guys inside started catcalling and harassing her.  With a slight movement of her head she indicated a car that was parked off to the side by the gas station dumpsters.  I saw a large light green car, like a Caddy or a Lincoln, with at least 2 or 3 shadowy figures inside.  She said they threatened her, and she was too scared to call her friend and wait.  


The woman was neat, so I didn’t even hesitate.  I finished pumping my gas and told her to hop in the car, that I’d take her home.  


At that time on a weeknight, and when I asked her to put her seat-belt on, she ignored me and kept looking for the car.  I assumed she was just scared.


A few blocks down the road, and she started asking me about money, “Where’s your purse?  Where’s your bag?  I need money.  You need to give me some money.” My stomach sank.  I have this woman in my car, and now she’s gonna rob me.  Fuck.  But when I thought about it, robbery just didn’t make much sense.  I was driving a 1985 Chevette (affectionately nicknamed “Shitbox”) and was wearing my work clothes: a ratty T-shirt and jeans with combat boots.  I did NOT look like a person with a lot of cash primarily because I wasn’t a person with a lot of cash.  


She’d twisted around in the seat again and started yelling, the light green car is right behind me.  She started cackling and bouncing up and down in the seat, “My boys are gonna FUCK YOU UP, bitch!  They’re gonna FUCK YOU UP!” She’s laughing like crazy, opening the glove box, looking in the back for a bag or purse, telling me all the messed up shit these guys are planning to do to me.


Now, if I had been VERY smart, I would have called the cops from the gas station and waited with her until they arrived. That would have been the intelligent thing to do.  Unfortunately, none of this crossed my mind until later.   In the moment, I just got really, really fucking angry.  I realized 3 key things all at once:


*	 There was an intersection up ahead
*	I had a spare box cutter that I kept for work in the driver’s side door compartment.
*	The crazy bitch still hadn’t put on her seat-belt.


I didn’t think.   I floored it and passed under the yellow light just as it turned red.  I glanced back to see if the green car was still behind me, and viciously satisfying, crack.  When she rebounded to the passenger seat, I had the box cutter in her face and was screaming some serious bat-shit crazy.   I can’t remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of, “Get the FUCK OUT. Get the FUCK out of my car before I CUT OFF YOUR FACE AND MAKE YOU EAT IT, BITCH.”  


The crazy screaming and box-cutter combo worked.  She grabbed blindly at the handle and popped the door open, and then I cut across town and got on to the highway to go home.  I was on the highway for about 5 minutes before the shakes started.  I pulled off to the shoulder to calm down and get my shit together, and then I drove home.


I told my older sister (I was living with her temporarily after the break-up with my ex) everything that happened.  She wrapped me in a tight bear hug while simultaneously yelling about how stupid I was for not going to the police.  I’ve never been so glad to be yelled at in my life.

So yeah, not like Indian summer but enough so people were in sundresses and shorts and the like. My friends are engaged in conversation and I'm sort of scanning around just watching and judging people. Right at the edge of the park there's a bench, and on it I see some guy sitting there.

 I don't know exactly why but I just got some dodgy feeling from him. He didn't fit it... It was a hot day and he was there all in black, so I follow his gaze to a small child sitting alone on the floor of the park, just running her hands through the sand and shit like that. The park is busy but she's alone, no one is close enough to be a friend or family if that makes sense. She's maybe 1 and a half, possibly 2 years old, ginger hair, pretty as a picture

So back to this guy. He was just staring, but I'm pretty sure this isn't her dad. This girl is white as snow, almost albino like, not even a hint of mixed race in her. Maybe he's a babysitter, family friend, adoptive parent, I don't know. But something about him massively gives me the creeps. He's switching between staring at this kid and tapping away on his mobile

 Suddenly this little girl bursts into tears, the man gets up and sort of power walks over to her, swoops down and picks her up. Hmm, bit weird. I start talking to this guy, just to check everything's as it should be. 

This is the conversation:

Me: aw

Him: um.. No.

M: oh right.. You babysitting or something?

H: no.. I'm

(Does it take that long to remember how you know this kid? Alarm bells ringing now

M: ah okay. What's her name?

*pause* 

H:... Lucy.

M: (to the kid) well hey sweetie! My names Poppy. What's yours?

Okay I never studied Child Talk

As I'm talking to the girl this guy is sort of looking around, so I wait till he's doing his little scenery scan and just go 'oh look she wants a cuddle!' And grab her right out of his arms. I've got her sitting on my hip now and I'm clinging on to her like she's my oxygen.
He realises what's happened and just turns and slowly walks away. Like

My heart is pumping like mad and this girl is just sitting there obviously oblivious to the danger she was in.  After standing for a minute or two regaining my composure

Then this fairly old lady
Me: is this your daughter?
Lady: oh gosh no! This is my granddaughter!
I hand her over and I'm like 'by the way
Thankfully this woman goes 'Ava.' I'm breathing a sigh of relief by this point. I say something along the lines of 'There was a guy with her over there saying he's her uncle

She told me her name was neko-chan (neko means cat, and that she could speak Japanese fluently. I laughed and asked her what her real name is, and she kept saying it was neko-chan. So I gave up, and asked her to say some Japanese things, but I noticed they were all very short sentences and her pronunciation was very difficult to understand. Also, she talked in a strange way, even in English (I think it's called three person perspective. In Japanese we call it 三人称 *sanninshou*, maybe she is a beginner? Also it's not uncommon for Japanese girls to speak like this, so I had a good time teaching her some words. However each time I taught her something

So for the rest of the night, and she even had some theme songs memorised in Japanese. Finally the night was ending, so I told her I had better go, I had class next morning. She followed me to the bus stop and waited with me for the bus, but she was still strange to me. When the bus arrived, she asked for my number. I think the problem with Japanese is we are too polite, I couldn't say no because it would be rude. So I reluctantly gave her my mobile number and I said goodbye

It took her 3 minutes to send a message to me, so I kept replying. She eventually told me her dream, which was to have Japanese boyfriend. I said sorry, but I was not looking for a girlfriend, but we could be friends. She stopped sending messages after that.

The next day I had school in the morning for 2 hours, I saw her waiting outside. I asked her what she was doing here, she told me ""neko-chan was waiting for you."" I still don't understand how she knew when and where my class was! I was so freaked out. She told me neko-chan had a surprise for me, and she took out an art book with lots of drawings. I admit, she was creepy, but she was a very good artist. She searched through the book which was full of very nice manga drawings, and towards the end she showed me the most disturbing thing I've seen. It was a manga of two men having sex, I can still remember how detailed it was. I won't make too many details though. Anyway

I just stood there, but I have another class. I'll see you later,"" and I walked away quickly. I was so disturbed and I felt sick. I called my tutor, because he was Australian and he was my age, so maybe he could tell me what to do. I tried to explain to him with my terrible English that a girl had drawn a picture of me having sex with another man and that I did not know what to do. Once he understood (at first he didn't believe me I think) he could not stop laughing, but he agreed to meet with me and take me to report her. So we did, but when we got there I realised I never know her real name, and she should come meet so we could talk about dating. I felt terrible because it was a lie

She met me 20 minutes later. She came and sat down, but eventually they took her away. I will never forget the look she gave me as they did, it was like mixed sadness and anger. I felt truly terrible. Afterwards they told me that she wasn't even a student at the university, and she was actually 15 years old. Only 15! I had no idea. Anyway, I have never seen her since then and I didn't return to that club, even though the other members were normal. When I think about it I still get freaked out.

1330829229.0,qgons,I Escaped out the Window - Peeping Tom/Rapist ,trixare4kids,909,110,101,"I posted this elsewhere a few years ago on Reddit for another thread

I am female and I was 16 when this happened years ago. 

There were two incidents that happened before the really scary incident.

We lived in a fairly new residential neighborhood and night about 10 PM I was laying in bed doing homework and I heard this tapping/scratching at my window.  My mother wasn't home that night and my father was already asleep. I jumped out of bed and ran into his room and said, I tell ya, couldn't even be bothered to go look out my window or outside, never mind the fact there was no bush or tree near enough to touch the window.  I was creeped out, but I double checked no one could see in my bedroom and that the curtains covered everything &amp; went back to bed.

A few weeks later I am sitting in the living room - it's just me and my mom home. I had just finished taking a shower and I was lounging in a towel while talking to my mom and painting my toenails.  Suddenly we both heard a tapping/scratching noise at the side window. My mom was *pissed*  She immediately jumped up and went outside where she confronted a man.  The man walked off. She ran in the house and called the police.

The police came and they caught the guy a few blocks away and my mom identified him as the man who was peeking in the window. The man claimed that he was just back there between the houses because he had to take a leak. The police said

He was hauled off to jail

Fast forward about a month later. I woke up in the middle of the night because my cat suddenly jumped off the bed. I heard a slight noise in the hallway. I tip-toed to my bedroom door and peeked out and THERE HE WAS -- THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN PEEKING. *THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP** was all I could hear

I've never

I was suddenly and powerfully ALERT -- I'm telling you that I had super strength, hear and smell better than normal -- and effect of all that adrenaline.

Within a few seconds I considered my options.

Scream? He had a gun. My father would come running and get shot.

Hide in the closet or under the bed? He'd find me.

Try and fight him? He had a gun.

This was before cell phones and I didn't have a phone in my room. So, bare feet onto the gravel. I am the kind of girl with ZERO upper body strength, and yet I was able to get up and out that window, quickly and quietly, with hardly any effort. Landing on the gravel in bare feet didn't even hurt a tiny bit.

Did I mention that I was completely nude? Yeah

I ran balls-out about three houses down to a neighbors house and banged on the door. Let me tell you, I didn't care for one second.

I went three houses down because I didn't want the creepy man to hear me banging on a door. When I didn't get an immediate response

Finally someone at this house answered the door quickly and I just got out ""Man in my house

This is what he brought with him: A gun, two exacto knives, a couple of dildos, bondage porn magazines, bleach, condoms, lube, pliers

Luckily it never went to court

I didn't sleep well again for a number of years. I would wake up numerous times per night at the slightest noise or even hint of noise.

It wasn't until I got a dog that I was able to sleep. I let my dog do his job -- warn me of any noise - and now I can sleep. It didn't hurt that I also got a gun and keep it near me when I sleep. I took a gun safety class

I will kill any mother fucker who comes into my house in the night.

A little background: I'm a big guy

So about 6-7 years ago I was in college, smoking, random hook ups and failed attempts. You know the deal.

I only lived an hour or so from home, etc. One such weekend I was returning home, when I recieved a text from a friend, we shall call ""Marie"". She said she wanted to hang out, but she had to close at her office supply store. So we decided that I would head over around 10, and when she was done, we'd take my car to the beach and catch up. Beach is like 10 mins from where I live, a really old friend of mine, it never really got to that place for either of us.

So I pull into the parking lot, get out of the car,and take a seat on my hood. About 10 mins later, a guy comes walking out of the store, stops, looks at my car, and starts walking over. He's wearing the stores uniform

Anyways, says ""Hey man, can I help you?""

Me: Nah man. Just waiting for a friend. Thanks.

Guy: Well

Now, I just played it nice...

Me: Marie. Just waiting for her to finish up.

Guy: Marie huh? And what are you guys going to do?

Me: That's none of your damn business.

Guy: What's your name?

Me: Drunken_Black_Belt

Guy: Can I see some ID proving that?

Me: Are you asking as a representative of your company? Because I know for a fact that you have no right to demand that of me.

Guy: No

Me: Well

Guy: Kurt

Me: Well Kurt

Kurt: Well then you wouldn't mind if we called the cops to verify your story?

Me: Seriously? Go ahead. Would love to see you explain to your bosses why your calling cops on customers and random people in the parking lot for no reason.

So Kurt wanders off, be right out."" Several minutes later she comes out, with Kurt on her heels. I can see him trying to stop her, pointing at me, waving his arms, etc. Marie pushes past him, and walks over to me. Give each other a quick hug and a ""howdy stranger!"". We turn our head and who should be standing right next to us? Yup

Marie: Kurt

Kurt: (To me) You know she has a bf right? And it's not you

Me: Yup. Not you either. And I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate you implying that she's the type who would cheat on someone. Cuz I can see sure as shit she doesn't appreciate it. And I'm not sure I appreciate it either. 

Kurt: I.. I didn't mean. I just. Not to say you would do that Marie

To steal a phrase I saw recently

Kurt walked to his car

So we get in the car, takes out his camera phone, takes a picture of my license plate. I begin to step out of my car when he hops back in his and takes off. I was pissed. I could understand someone being apprehensive, but this was fucking ridiculuos. 

So me and Marie chill, call it a night.  Next day she shows me several texts sent from Kurt, saying things like ""Want to make sure you're ok. That guy looked sketchy. Just text me when you're home ok. You sure you should be hanging out with guys like that?  I'm only looking out for you. You're so pretty and just know you don't know how guys can be.  Can you call me? Wanna know you're alright. Etc Etc"".  About 10 messages in total were sent to her till about 3 am or so.  Then another in the morning saying ""DID YOU MAKE IT HOME! I SAW YOU UPDATED FB! YOU OK?

The story is bad enough. But trust me dear reader

Next weekend I'm back in town, and head over. I see she's with customers, so I walk by, placing the coffee on her register, and she says she'll be on break in 5 mins. So I wander around, grab my cd's, and do some random browsing. 

I'm in the back of the store, and HEY IT'S FUCKING KURT! YAY!

He has a shit eating grin on his face, and whispers ""Hey asshole""

Me: Excuse me?

Kurt: What the fuck you doing here? 

Me: What do you want?

Kurt: You

This of course

Kurt: Laugh it up. I know you're stealing those cd's. I can bring you in right now

Me: Actually, you couldn't do that. I don't know what you're problem is but...

Kurt: I got you on camera. 

Me: You guys don't have cameras.

Kurt: All I have to do is say I saw you. 

At this point

Nope! I wripped my wrist free, pinning him against a display.

Me: Listen here you little shit. I don't know what the fuck your problem is

And that's when his manager walked around the corner and saw us. It obviously didn't look good for me. I looked guiltier than Jodi Arias. The manager broke us up, and told me to come with him. Fine, I'm not gonna cause an issue. We go to the back room, and naturally Marie see's me being led back there by her manager, and has a ""WTF"" look on her face. Kurt is beaming like he just got a blow job from Michelle Obama while forcing Barack to watch. Dude couldn't be prouder.

We get in the back

Tip to all would be liars. When you're already getting away with something

Kurt: Well he was in here stalking you again and I told him to back off and leave you alone. Then when tried to push him out the store he attacked me.

Manager: Wait

Kurt: Well

So we sat down, the week before, Kurt came in with a guitar and attempted to serenade Marie in the break room with everyone there. Marie complained, and he was talked to for harassment, and they were to be seperated on the schedule where possible. Several other employees had also come to the manager after that incident saying he would call to see if she had come in for her shift yet, when he was on his day off, and show up randomly.

 Luckily for me the manager saw what was really going on, but Marie said she wasn't comfortable with him working with her. Manager said they'd have to do an official investigation, but that he wouldn't work till a decision was made. Kurt was left in the back room while the manager did paperwork, and Marie was cut out early for her trouble. Kurt looked like I just kicked his favorite puppy into a woodchipper and then made him watch while his grandma blew me.  Look of defeat and submission doesn't even begin to describe it.  He started crying and attempting to apologize to Marie, saying he just wanted her to give him a chance.  It was incredibly sad.

Found out a week later Kurt was fired

We didn't really talk much via facebook, so it seemed okay. He asked if he could take me out to dinner the first week of November, and I was pretty excited about it.

Date night rolls around. I meet him at the restaurant

RF #1 - I'm 25

RF #2 - He complained a lot about women he had dated before not approving of his job. (He is a caddy at a PGA golf course)

Anyway, but asked if we could keep in touch and hopefully get together again when I got home from my Thanksgiving trip. He seemed fine with it, we said our good byes, and that was that.

The following week

He would call a bunch of times in a row, ""Hey, I don't think this is going to work out. I'm sorry. Please stop contacting me.""

The week after Thanksgiving I didn't have access to my phone. By the time I got it back again

""Hey

""I didn't know you shopped at [certain neighborhood grocery store]!"" Again

It was becoming apparent he was following me. Eventually my friends urged me to call the police

By this time it was the week after Christmas. I woke to a text threatening me if I should return back to my city from visiting my parents a few states away because I ""waste the time of decent Southern men."" I called the cops immediately.

We were *not* disappointed. If anything

Aside from what you will see in the photos

The amount of dust in the passageways is actually quite unbearable

I won't ramble on, the sense of 'evil' was overpowering. The tension is amplified tenfold by the fact that, had we encountered someone or something, the layout of the structure, and the multiple tight-squeezes, mean a safe, speedy exit is nigh on impossible. It truly is a hell-hole.

1354627614.0,149e3n,My roommate's boyfriend sexually assaulted me while I was asleep.,fourfivedicks,853,153,86,"This happened just about two weeks ago. I live in a two bedroom apartment with my long-time friend, and I just consider myself a regular guy. Mark is the same

(Before I start this story, and a younger brother that's bisexual--my poor parents; one lesbian, one straight, and the other bi. Mark was raised like my brother, so there's another gay.)

ANNNYWAY

Last month, was clean-shaven, was wearing the remnants of a business suit, he was our age--25, Mark said. His name was Chad, and he was Mark's new love interest. I greeted Chad and welcomed him into our humble abode.

Chad was great! He played Halo with me, even *I* was developing a crush on this guy!)

This went on for about two weeks; Chad would come over

One night, but I heard them go into Mark's bedroom, but I fell asleep soon after. It was probably like three hours later when I was woken up by the sound of my door clicking shut. Normally, I'm a very heavy sleeper, able to sleep through very loud 5am construction with my windows open. But this woke me up.

Groggy and slightly agitated, a look of fear on his face. I felt a chill run down my spine, and I was on alert.

""What are you doing

""I thought I heard you call my name."" He said it in a whisper, then he apologized and left.

The next morning, but I soon forgot about it (full-time student with a full-time job, I don't have time to dwell on personal dramas).

Two nights later, because I remember my eyes popping open and looking right at my alarm clock. But before I could process what was going on, I felt a hand clamp across my mouth, and another deliver a harsh blow against my Adam's apple. I started choking.

It was *Chad*. He was on top of me, but I couldn't speak because of my gagging from the hit to my throat.

Chad pulled me down, telling me that it would be over soon, and that he knew I was curious. I was frantic, and I was slow because of the NyQuil I had consumed, but I managed to roll over, just as Chad took off his pants, and I kicked him off of me. I was able to hit him in the balls

Then Mark burst inside

Chad stood up, but Mark went insane and almost beat the shit out of him. I pulled him off, and Mark gave Chad an ultimatum: either he calls the cops, or he gets the fuck out and doesn't come back.

Chad left immediately, and we got a call two days later that Chad was in custody and he confessed. Mark also let out a small detail: Chad did cocaine, which was in his system when he was picked up.

But, I think, for having it happen. He keeps apologizing every time I see him, but shit happens. I'm just glad that Mark wasn't hurt by him.

Alright

Ok so some background. I live in a house with 8 people in total. It's quite a large, but as it's summer, people have started to move out. For the last week or so there's only been three of us in the house. Myself, my boyfriend and another housemate.

With our house being so full of people

I'm going to try and structure the events that make me think so as best I can now.

**1.** Above our shower

Now, he's not). So there's that.

**2.** Four out of eight people in our house smoke. So there's often tobacco and rolling papers lying around the front room or kitchen. For a long time now, and we'd find one of these shitty cigarettes rolled just sitting in the tobacco; like someone had rolled it then decided it isn't good enough to smoke and just leaving it for us to find. 

At first we had a laugh about it

**3.** My boyfriend bought me a lollypop a few days earlier (one of those oversized swirly ones) and he and I were stood in the kitchen with cigarettes one day when I put the lollypop on the fridge. Cut to a little later

Neither me or my bf would have stubbed out a cigarette on a lolly he bought me. We were the only people in the house at the time (or should have been).

**4.**Smaller and not exactly scary


**5.** Now this is the thing that has weirded me out the most out of everything for some reason. My boyfriend and I had been away for the weekend

My bf and I get home, maybe a bit creeped out, but more intrigued than anything. Whatever, don't think about it. All three of us chat about other stuff and end up going to bed at the same time.

My boyfriend and I were awake in bed for a while, I head downstairs, the first one up, and I notice something straight away that was not there the night before.

Tiny little barcode stickers, just in this sort of hourglass number 8 sort of shape. First thing I do, get my housemate and ask him if he's been downstairs. He says no, asks why, I show him the stickers. He's as weirded out and intrigued as I am. My boyfriend isn't up yet but just to check, I go and ask him if it was him. Nope. They're still there. I can get a picture if anyone really wanted. We've tried taking them off but they're little bastards to pull off, they leave marks on the sofa.

Bearing in mind we have a damage deposit on this house we all want back




All of these things are alongside banging and sounds like footsteps or taps being turned on or things being dragged across the floor. The sounds are worrying enough but I always put it down to it being an  old house

Another point of interest which I only realised lately. My boyfriend lost his house keys a good while back. Anyone could have picked up these keys and found out where we live.



I'm currently at my parents house. But the more I stay at my own house


What do you think Reddit? Do I get someone to check? Or can you come up with another suitable explanation for all of this going-on? What do I do if there is someone up in my attic? I'm scared to go back to my own house.




**TL:DR: I think there's someone living in my attic but too scared to check**



**EDIT**: Holy shit I was not expecting this response. Thanks guys. I think. These responses have made everything feel way more real than before when I thought I was just being paranoid. Clearing a few things up:

I'll try get my boyfriend to message me a photo of the stickers. He's currently the only one in the house. Oh fuck. 

I'm currently at home as stated. I was supposed to go home tomorrow (tuesday) but due to a family member going into hospital I've got to stay here for another week. So I won't be back until some point next week. Sorry about that

I'm thinking we should get the cops to do a sweep of our house and attic after reading the comments. I'm too much of a wuss to let me or my housemates do anything alone

Why I haven't done anything until now: I thought I was being way over paranoid in my head

So long story short

**EDIT NUMBER 2**: A photo of the stickers. Sorry for the shitty quality
Once again sorry for the bad quality D:

I live in North Wales, though, for an adolescent boy, it is certainly lacking in things to do.  As a result, my friends and I would often find ourselves mindlessly exploring areas of countryside and coastline.

Despite it being quite sparsely populated, train tracks run alongside this road for most of its course, occasionally passing overhead via a small cement bridge.

Anyway, as one of the group had observed a man-hole cover nearby which we believed to be the entrance. On closer inspection, we discovered that several tools would be required in order to gain entry.

We returned with the necessary equipment and proceeded to unbolt the cover. This had to be done stealthily as the train track was right beside us

It wasn't long before we had removed the heavy steel disc, we are totally confined into the narrow space that leads into the main area. If you are confused as to what the hell this 'bridge' is supposed to be, you probably should be, because it was rather peculiar. I mean, I would have never known there was even an inside had we not found the man-hole.

So, to the other side of the structure there is a growing sense of claustrophobia between us. The distance from end to the other is surprisingly long, but by the halfway point you can look down through narrow gaps onto the motorway below. This was actually pretty cool, which helped keep us calm, in a strange way.

At this point

No more than a few metres beyond halfway (which we could tell due to the symmetry of the passageways through the bridge)

I reached the end first, or a magazine, showing a fully naked lady in an erotic position. The reason I don't just refer to it as 'porn' is because something was different about it; I can't put my finger on it but it seemed more sinister than sexy, if that makes any sense.

More disturbingly the eyes of the woman on display had been cut from the page. Removed with precision, gut-wrenching, blood-drenched condom.

Needless to say we got the fuck out of there as fast as humanly possible, we were all praying to God that the man-hole hadn't been re-sealed, as it was impossible to tell until you reached the ladder itself. Thankfully the exit route was clear, and we promptly dashed as far away as our legs could carry us.

I'm sure this ending comes as a disappointment to some of you reading this, yet nowhere near enough people to have someone clearly lose grip on society without somebody taking notice. For example, there was literally only one homeless man, who everyone in the area knew and grew fond of, eventually resulting in a mass gathering at his funeral when he passed away. 

I sometimes think, and do God-knows-what, that ends up with a condom full of blood. You honestly couldn't envision a more surreal situation. 

It has just come to my realisation that what we unearthed that night has not once been uttered to another soul. As a naive teenager, or at least *someone* know about what was down there, because it wasn't the doings of a healthy-minded individual.

So, and hopefully a bit braver, I'm considering going down there again, accompanied of course, to see what fucked up shit might be waiting. This could well happen in the next couple days, and rest assured I will 100% post an update as I currently have no job, so time is plentiful! 

Thanks for reading.  

**EDIT**: As promised, and as a result I have decided to use a simple filter on most of the outdoor shots, simply to reduce the light, and give it the eeriness it deserves. 

*Unfortunately*, as they had been there before. When I expressed my wishes to navigate through the bridge, they instantly nope'd the fuck out of there! As you can imagine, I was massively disappointed. I hope to go back soon with a different bunch of guys, but I can't promise when. 

Perhaps, I could reply to you individually so you don't have to keep checking back, just wait for a message? Just a thought.

Either way

Just as it was getting weird, my mother was heavily pregnant at this point. As soon as the other man saw my mother do this he stopped what he was saying, mid sentence, turned around and walked back into the adjacent store without a word. They both thought it was odd but frankly my dad was glad to be away from the man. They continued on shopping and went home.

My father highly suspects that Bob Berdella was scoping him out as a potential victim and upon seeing my pregnant mother realized he wasn't gay. Oh, and the shop he came out of?

My eldest sister was 15 at the time and was therefore capable of watching the rest of us for a few hours. My parents left for a short dinner and movie


Shortly after they left, a knocking began at the door. 


My eldest sister called out


My sister told him to leave and that she was calling the cops. She quickly grabbed the cordless phone and forced the rest of us and the dog into the bathroom since it was the only room with no windows and a lock. Each sister had a ""weapon"" of some sort; a wiffle ball bat, and a large knife from the kitchen. We all piled into the bath tub, kind of like they sit in the tub while training in the movie Cool Runnings. My eldest sister grabbed blankets from the bathroom closet and tucked us in. And...that is where my four year old self fell asleep. 


My sisters and parents have told me the rest over the years. My eldest sister called the neighbors who were our friends. They lived a few blocks away as we were set out in the country a little ways. But we found out later that they were out for the night and no help to us. My sisters could hear banging and the doors rattling as the person or persons tried to get in from multiple areas. This was before everyone had cellphones, the banging and rattling was incessant. My parents came home with the police right behind them and they did a thorough search of the surrounding area. Damage to our doors and window frames were found all around the outside of first floor of the house and a couple empty pizza boxes were abandoned on the front porch. 


They never found out who did it, since they couldn't get in during that 15-20 minute window, but the fear they inspired was very real. I know it haunted my sisters and greatly influenced their actions for years after.

I lived in a big city where I went to school but I still used my car more than public transportation since I needed to transport a lot of materials back and forth from my apartment to campus (sculpture major.)

 One weeknight I had been working late in the studio and decided to stop at the 24hour drugstore chain on my drive home to pick up a few things (tampons and chocolate.) It was pretty late

After I had been there about three minutes, kinda jittery looking. He noticed me and started following me around the store in a really obvious way. I was trying to ignore him, get my stuff and get out of there. He came up to me and started doing this ""psst"" noise like he was trying to discreetly get my attention. I kept ignoring him. Then he said ""fuck you bitch"" and left the store. I figured, whatever... Weirdo. 

As I paid for my stuff I had this overwhelming gut feeling to ask the cashier if he wouldn't mind walking me out to my car since that jittery guy had creeped me out. The cashier said it was cool and we make our way out to the parking lot. So I'm feeling more at ease about half way to my car and I turn to say thanks to the cashier for his help when he grabs my shoulder and says

About 8 months ago I finally moved out of my mom's house and got my own place. For the first few months

3 months after I moved in I started getting phone calls and even flowers from an unknown person. I didn't really think anything of it at first. Gradually I started to notice things going missing from my kitchen and living room

I started going to bed earlier out of fear and I didn't go downstairs until the morning
My brother mentioned the 'sky box incident' in his post which was the breaking point for me. I had an AV transmitter (something like that anyway) installed so i could watch cable in my bedroom


When I told him he looked at me like I was crazy and said I was being paranoid. Eventually he started to take me seriously and offered to stay at my house for a few nights on the condition our younger brother could tag along


A couple days later he turned up again and this time I was frantic as I could hear him walking around the house and watching TV. I started to worry he was going to come up stairs so I called my brother and told him to get the hell over here. I stood by the window of my bedroom watching out for his car. 
My younger brother (Who should not have been involved in this at all) pulled up first and stayed in his car until my other brother arrived. When he did they jumped over the fence that leads to an alley to the right of the house


When they got to the kitchen window, don't move and stay in your room."". To actually hear my brother saying he could see him terrified me, a part of me wanted to believe that I was crazy.


So
Around a minute later I heard the patio door (which sticks) opening, I saw a man in a black trench coat with a baseball cap on walking up the stairs. I shut the door and pushed my wardrobe in front of it as quietly as I could.


Then I heard my brothers running up the steps. There was a struggle and I heard the man shout out ""I'm sorry

One night after having a few drinks, actually), and when we partied it was not your typical UCSB mega-rager. More like a small get together with friends. We would often have a few people spend the night, sleep on our furniture our in our beds as the case may be. 

That night my roommates had had a few people over who I didn't know, but it was like he was putting all of his energy into lying as still and rigid as possible. I paused, and the guy quickly jerked his head to face me, without moving his limbs, so quickly that it startled me. I could see his wide open eyes glinting in the dark. 

Figuring that I'd startled him or that he was drunk or maybe on some kind of stimulant and unable to sleep

At 4:30 am I woke up. There was a strange sound at the door almost like somebody was drumming their fingers against the wood very quietly. I lay still and listened. There were more quiet sounds like someone scratching the door with their fingers


I got my cell phone and texted my roommate because I was afraid to make a sound. ""Your friend is freaking me out


She didn't text me back, scratching a wooden door with your fingernails can't feel good. He also grabbed at the knob and jiggled it super forcefully. 


Because neither of them answered, and I wanted to loop my roommates in since it was one of their friends. 


The scratching stopped abruptly and I called my roommate, can you please deal with it? Do we need to call the cops? He's seriously scaring me and he was scratching at my bedroom door, really fucking weird."" 


She didn't say anything for several seconds and when she did speak


Suddenly I heard a loud banging in the other end of the house, shared a bedroom. The bangs were followed by the sound of them screaming in fear. I quickly dialed the police as this maniac proceeded to bang against the (luckily) locked bedroom door of my two roommates as they screamed. The heaviness of the blows left no doubt that he was trying to break the door down. 


I'd told the 911 operator the situation and she'd dispatched two squad cars. 

The police in Isla Vista are generally used to peeling drunks off the sidewalk and breaking up brawling frat bros. This was really serious and strange and I think the dispatcher got the sense from my tone how terrified I was, which is my biggest regret about this situation, since when I look back it would have been so awesome to just stomp the shit out of those fingers and hear the guy howl in pain. 

When the cops rolled up

He had broken in through our side door by jimmying the lock somehow. My door was covered in what turned out to be huge gauges he'd made using a pair of scissors

What terrifies me most about this was that I walked right past him. I looked him right in the face. I realize now that he was not trying to sleep or on drugs, and tried to blend into the couch in the darkness.

I'm not really paying much attention but I see her cross the street shooting furtive looks in my direction. As she reaches the other side, without thinking, cross the street so I can turn from there back towards my house.

1353975553.0,13ucir,Me and my friends found a little dead boy inside a suitcase in a pond,Isho,689,118,80,"Hi guys! First time posting on /r/letsnotmeet. I have a horrific story from 5 years ago that I would like to share with you guys.

The year was 2007 and Me and my friends were in the 9th grade and were hypnotized by Runescape (it's a massive online multiplayer rpg game for those who don't know). We were mostly found playing Runescape and talking about Runescape or doing things related to Runescape during our free time. 

One day, which is about 1.2 miles) talking and doing things Runescape related after school (Doing those stupid animated dances, talking about character levels, quests, etc) when we noticed a suitcase floating towards the edge of the pond. The pond that I'm talking about was actually a big duck pond. It was filthy. It obviously had ducks and other wildlife, but it also contained murky water and other crap. It wasn't unusual to find weird shit there.

Being curious little boys, we immediately SPRINTED away and ended up vomiting all over the place.

We had no idea what to do. We didn't even know if the body was real or not. There was no way in hell someone would just dump a fucking kid's body in the pond in a suitcase. We were also scared that we would be held responsible for the death (we were young and stupid...). After deliberating for a while, this had increased to about 15 police vehicles with 10s and 20s of media vans from all the major media sources in Sydney. It gained national media coverage for a few days and a manhunt had begun for the killer. Tributes were held everyday for a few weeks with thousands of people coming everyday to place candles, flowers and lights all around the pond.

The police were looking for a few statements from us

They eventually found out that the kid was a 2 year old kid and had been murdered by his mother. Now get this.... The kid was actually a nephew of a kid in OUR grade. The killer was his sister and the victim was his own nephew. The family had known to be junkies and the kid in our grade was pretty much torn apart at school (he was a bully). I never did say much to him

I still have the guy on my facebook and we say our hi's and hello's every few years. This particular incident probably changed him for the best (I shouldn't be saying this but he was heading down the path with drugs and alcohol at that young age). He's a nice guy now and is currently enrolled in the Australian army.

One night I woke up to the sound of someone pounding on the front door drunkenly slurring, and she was barking and growling as she stood in front of the door.

My mom went to the door

“Let me in

My mom told the man. “I have a vicious dog here begging to tear you apart. You don’t want me to open the door. You better leave.”

There was silence and more silence and then we looked out the curtains to see the man stumbling down the street. We’d already called the police and they picked him up and he had told them that he’d been watching me through my bedroom window.  

I got new curtains and slept with Toker in the room with me after that.

Toker’s protective instincts had been really triggered that night. A few months later I was walking her when a man stepped out of his drive way and blocked me on the sidewalk.

The girl responded politely that she was studying to be a yoga instructor


Initially I was just relieved he wasn't talking to me. I am not a 'tough guy' at all, and as they continued to talk, his questions got stranger, asking what she was up to, if she lived with friends or alone. I decided to walk a bit slower, so I stayed close to them in case anything went wrong or the guy tried anything. I had no idea what i'd do if push came to shove, I just felt it was the right thing to do.


So this all went on for another five minutes or so and I was getting close to my street. The girl was obviously uncomfortable and just wanted the conversation to end. I was almost at my corner, obscured from her view, he was holding a knife. I stopped and stood there like an idiot. There was no one else around just us three now standing still, and the guy looked at me and shook his head, giving me a ""just walk away buddy"" kind of look, with anger in his eyes. Then I almost jumped when I heard a car horn, and I looked across the street to see a parked dark blue car with a man in driver's seat, with that sort of look that said ""get out of here before something bad happens"". This was a joint effort


My heart was racing, and in my terror my mind flashed to something I once read about what you should do if you're attacked by a bear. I guess it was flight or fight and I picked fight, I raised my arms up to try to look bigger and starting screaming like an animal, I must have seemed completely deranged, but I got right up in the guy's face and I still don't know how this worked but it must have been so shocking that he just bolted, ran to the car and got in sped away, all of it happening in the space of 10 seconds or so. 


After that, but after all of this I couldn't even remember what the guy looked like, nor the number plate of the car. I just couldn't believe how fortunate it all was, I'd forgotten my headphones so i could hear the exchange, the fact I turned around for one last look, and that the whole screaming and waving my arms around actually worked.

1375891315.0,1jw1yq,My first babysitting gig and the worst fear I've ever felt...,mav49,629,110,41,"I grew up in a really safe city in the Midwest

I was 11 at the time, but this was my first job as a “real” babysitter, watching the two grade-school-aged children who lived across the street. They were family friends, the parents had promised they’d be home by 11pm, and I knew that my parents were home and ready to step in if I needed anything, so I was a little nervous but felt like I had things under control.


The kids were a novice babysitter’s dream; they’d been trained that they are only allowed to choose one treat each before bed


The mom is an interior designer, and I was watching TV with their elderly white lab, Alex. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something large and light-colored brush past the window behind me. I thought it might just be a deer, but I was eleven and alone and I have an active imagination, so I began to feel uneasy and pretty on edge. The parents weren’t due back for another two hours, so I walked into the kitchen to call my mom and dad for reassurance. Alex followed.


Their kitchen faces the living room, so I told her that, no, I didn’t need Dad to come over, and that, yes, I’d call her if I needed anything at all.

I hung up the phone and sat down on the floor to rub Alex’s ears and belly for a few minutes, and noticed a tiny light bobbing around in the woods.  Probably just a neighbor, I thought. But as I watched, the light seemed to be moving in what was undeniably my direction.


My whole body froze and I stared as the light got closer and closer to the living room windows, that the light had grown large enough that the source had to be right outside the house. The beam swung from one side of the living room to the other, and then settled directly on my face.


I don’t even think I squinted in the bright light as it shone through the window into my eyes...I was too startled. Alex snoozed on, hollow eye sockets and the glowing curves of someone’s cheeks, but the face’s details were lost in the harsh angle of the flashlight’s beam. 


At this point I was trying with all my might to scream, and was completely immobilized by it. Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion, and I was totally powerless.


The light swung around to point at me, and for whatever reason that was enough to finally let me move again. I quickly stood, and hit “DIAL,” about to call 9-1-1 as I mentally debated whether to hole up in the master bedroom with the children or just grab them and try to run out the front door to my parent’s house. The Rec class had not prepared me for this. Before I even got as far as the foyer and the first “1,” though, I heard a loud BOOM and felt my gut leap into my throat as I realized that I’d remembered close the main garage doors and lock the door from the garage to the laundry room, but couldn’t remember locking the man-door from the garage to their backyard.


I almost dropped the phone as someone began pounding on the interior door.

“Mav49…MAV49!! It’s DAD!!! Let me in!!!” I stumbled over


My dad could hardly stand up, under the assumption that Mom had mentioned he’d be coming over. He saw me through the window and attempted to show me it was him by pointing at me, and then shining the light on his face. UNDER his freaking face. He was unaware that the shadows made it impossible to tell who he was…until he saw the color drain from my face and realized he’d just given me the scare of my life. He thought it was pretty funny; I didn’t really agree. I know that the ending kind of makes this story inappropriate for LetsNotMeet, but up until I heard my dad’s voice I really thought I was about to get all kinds of murdered.

1371369626.0,1gg1mn,Let's Play!,Sssecretsss,593,73,52,"This happened when I was about 8. For reference
        
I grew up in an apartment complex with about 20 buildings
           
One day I had gotten off the bus and crossed the road when I saw that some neighbourhood kids had drawn a hopscotch on the footpath outside the complex. I loved hopscotch, came over and asked if she could play. I was a naturally shy little girl, but I was also very polite, especially to adults. I gave her my stone and let her have a go. Once she'd had a go she asked if her friends could play. Three guys, all in their mid to late-twenties came over.
               
This freaked me out. As I said, but I had to go home. She gave me a sad look and sad that she had hoped we would be good friends. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I was pretty scared, so I lied and told her I would take my school bag home and come right back.
                
I picked up my bag and hightailed it out of there. I got home and thought that would be the end of it. I was scared of getting in trouble from my parents for talking to strangers
                         
The next day the lady was waiting for me at the gates to the complex. She said that she was very sad that I hadn't come back and it had hurt her feelings. I said I was sorry
                         
I knew I shouldn't go with her, I hated being yelled at, so this freaked me right out and I started to cry. The lady immediately said she was sorry and gave me a hug. Then she tried to lead me to the van, saying an ice-cream would make it all better. I pulled away and started to run home.
            
This time
                           
I could hear them running after me and I knew they were faster than me
          
""Do you like hide-and-seek? Let's play! Ready? We're coming to get you!""
                   
I was shivering violently and knew that they'd find me here. I decided I'd get to the elevator shaft, thinking that they'd see the elevator stop on the top floor and assume I was hiding there, so they'd search there while I got away.
                  
The elevator was on the other side of the car park, then I bolted for the elevator.
          
The elevator was in a small room that had a huge door. I got inside, I closed the door.
                           
Now, so it made a huge noise as it closed and even as I ran into the elevator I knew they'd know where I was. The elevator was full of people and I squeezed right to the back, hiding behind two boys and a girl who I'd seen around before. The girl lived in my building, but on a different floor. I watched the elevator doors closing, praying that they would hurry up. Just before they closed a hand shot between them and they opened again. The woman was there, looking furious.

""Get out here!"" she yelled.

An elderly woman asked what the matter was and the woman said I was her daughter and I'd run away. I was too scared to speak as the woman grabbed my arm and tried to drag me out.
                     
One of the boys sensed something was wrong and stopped her. He asked if I knew her and I shook my head and started to cry. The girl from my building picked me up while the boy told the woman to leave me alone. Since the elevator was full of people who now realised what was happening the woman and the guys disappeared.
                                                              
The girl from my building and the two guys walked me home and told my parents what had happened. The police were called and after some investigating (I wasn't told this until years later) found that the woman and the men were child traffickers. I'm so grateful that that boy realised something was off and stepped in. Who knows where I'd be if he hadn't.

I walked away again, my Italian is not the best and I probably wouldn't have understood them.  The four guys walked out of the store, each taking a moment to find me and look at me before they did.  Then they're gone.  I'm relieved.

About two minutes later, but he says, ""I wished to warn you that outside the store are, ah, six...no, SEVEN men, ah, there are seven men outside waiting for you.  You should not go out there for some time.""

""Waiting for me?  How do you know they're waiting for me.""

He laughs nervously; embarrassed, ah, they are saying things they will do to you, and it...yes, the things they said, they talked of you, they described you, do not go out.""

""What things did they say?""

""No, you do not want to know, no, no.  But do not go outside, they say they wait for you.""

I look out the front entrance and can see them across the street, as the man said.  Some are pacing.  I feel like I'm being hunted.

I am freaked the fuck out.  I start looking through my phone contacts to see who could help me.  Before I figure that out

It was late night. The store was open 7 days a week. We weren't always 24 hours, it was a 24 hour store. This was Thursday night.

Now, and the first shift on weekends. He'd come in at midnight to relieve me, but I'd do his magazine counts for him.

I'm walking around the store, with a smile and a ""Hello. How are you today?"" He smiled at me, said he was ""Fine."" and continued looking at the magazine rack I had just straightened up. 

I continue walking around the store, and it was creepy, and it was obvious. I had been so intent on straightening the shelves that I hadn't noticed. He wasn't super close to me. He would stand in the adjacent aisles behind me, or way down the aisle away from me. I just thought he was working his way around the store, but as I watched the camera, I could notice him *staring* at me. 

I turned to the live feed, and that I needed to get out of the store and fast. He had only gotten a dollar for some quarters, which meant I had 4 minutes before he came out. The other problem was: He had his booth door cracked, and he had the one nearest the main door. He was literally watching the door as he watched his porn sample.

We thought fast. One of my regulars came in, and slipped out with me. We walked the full length around the store, through the door that wasn't open to the public (we could open it from the inside, but it had no handles on the outside.) It meant we had to walk around the unlit part of the store's lot, around the back, to get to my car.

The guy, there was a ""privacy"" divider, which divided the front parking lot and the back parking lot. I usually parked in the front. The store had been full that night, so I had parked in the back. My regular and I were able to sneak me into my car (as I got in, he locked all the doors, and gestured for me to lock the driver's door.) When we were done, I waved at him

Not two minutes later, got in his car, and followed."" Sure enough, behind me, is a car. Following me. I took a few back roads (speeding heavily) just to check. Yep. I'm being followed....

So, it became my only job) and the Sargent that would come get coffee from me was there. He escorted me home, driving behind me in his cruiser. He got out, walked me up the stairs, took my phone number, and made sure that I was locked safely in my apartment.

He sat in my darkened parking lot, and that I should be safe. If I heard anything suspicious, I was to call 911.

Back in my late teens in Dublin, to the point that I could sit at any table and know at least a few people.

Nothing much of note happened during my time in the club.

At the end of the night

I woke up in the morning, staring at me wide-eyed with utter devotion and a weird smile. It was totally fucking horrible. I had no idea what to say, so I said nothing. I was so weirded out by her expression and the whole bizarre nature of the situation, I was dumbstruck. It wasn't a lustful look - it was spooky, obsessive, insane looking.

I know for a lot of guys the idea of having some random woman appear in their bedroom might be a thrill, got dressed, summoned up a bit of courage, turned to her and said ""You're leaving. Now."" and essentially marched her out of the house, telling her that buses leave from the end of the road every half hour. She left without saying anything.

From talking to friends and family, asked around until someone told her the rough area I lived in, got a taxi there, knocked on random doors, waking up neighbours and eventually one told her exactly where I lived, and then lied to my sister saying that I had been expecting her.

I went to high school with a guy, so I saw more of him. By junior year he had dropped out and tried to get his GED. That was the last I heard of Bob, for a while at least.

Fast forward to the summer 2 years after graduating: Bob calls me up, I thought that it was weird that Bob would call me up. I declined his offer.

The following November Bob is on the news because he had killed his partner- he worked for an armored van service- and stolen the money in the armored van. There were news updates about him fleeing out of the state. He was finally caught, when his case went to trial, his journal was entered into evidence. The prosecutor said that Bob wrote that he and his friend (the same one that was going to go camping) hatched a plan to become professional assassins. I believe that the camping trip he invited me on was all a ruse so that he could get me in a secluded place so that he and his friend could practice how to murder someone- namely, me.

1374695316.0,1iz71i,I don't scream for Ice Cream anymore,ZGdaOG,572,92,42,"Let me just preface this with the fact that this was the ONE TIME my parents let me stay home unsupervised for an entire day without a much older baby sitter. And so begins my story.....


It all started one hot, my best friend Sarah at the time, was 9 years old. We were laying out on the trampoline, playing the ""What do you wanna do?""....""I dunno...what do YOU wanna do?"" game. Then we heard that exciting little jingle in the distance: The ice cream man! We all started scrambling out the door after the older sister (Tammy) who had the money.

We rushed down the street to the waiting ice cream man, but he didn't stop smiling. It was a sinister type smile, coupled with an unrelenting gaze fixed right on us. We quickly bought our ice cream and bubble gum and left. 

As we were walking back towards our cul-de-sac, so lets just sit here on Ms. Day's driveway until he drives away."" Up until this point Tammy had a history of telling us bogus stories to try and scare us, so Sarah stared whining. On any other day I would have agreed with her, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something was off. The ice cream truck then continued towards us, driving incredibly slow around our cul-de-sac. He was still smiling, and his eyes were still trained on the three of us. When he passed us, he even winked. 

As soon as he disappeared around the corner, and we had all calmed down a bit, and had settled onto her parents bed to watch some terrible daytime TV like Jerry Springer or something. At that point, out of her parents window (that faces in towards the cul-de-sac on the second floor) we saw the ice cream truck stopped outside of Ms.Day's house. We didn't know how long he had been there, considering he didn't have the jingle playing. He wasn't parked there very long, and eventually slowly drove away. 

By this time, however, we saw him get out of the truck in front of Ms. Day's house and walked up towards the front door, examining the outside of the house. He had a pad of paper out, and began to jot some things down. We all started panicking at this point, as Tammy yelled out ""HE'S WRITING DOWN THE ADDRESS!?"" He returned to the ice cream wagon, and as he started the turn the truck around he looked up and saw us in the window. We hit the floor like we were under fire, and jotted more down on his pad of paper. 

As soon as he drove away that time

Ultimately, the addresses of Ms. Day's house and Tammy and Sarah's house, as well as plans for when he was going to ""come back for us"". The guy was a registered child sex offender, with a warrant out for his arrest. I'm not sure how he got in that position to be selling ice cream to children in the first place, but he was.
So now every time I hear the Ice Cream Wagon jingle


tl;dr I was almost abducted by the ice cream man

Her cousins, so they checked the house, but couldn't find anything missing. They just assumed that they left the place unlocked.

That night, when her cat just would not shut up. It was lying on the floor of her room, hissing. Despite her appeals, the cat kept going, being very aggressive towards the underside of the bed she was lying on. She decided to see what the fuss was about, so she got down on her hands and knees, and looked.

There was a guy lying there, holding up a mean-looking knife.

This girl obviously screamed like crazy and bolted out of her room, locking the guy in there, while the police were called. As much as he tried to hold this guy inside the room, the guy ended up overpowering him and getting the door open and running as fast as he could out of the house.

I will never forget the woman in the passenger seat. She was really skinny with gray hair that had a yellow-tobacco hue from serious smoking. I didn't see the man driving that well because he was looking mostly in the driver's side mirror and only occasionally glanced at us. Their clothes were old and seemed dirty.

Six months ago I had gotten my first apartment. My mom and sister helped me move and the first week by my self was great! I was enjoying my freedom and independence and

Luckily for me my neighbors had a cat. He was (still is) a sweet and loving tabby cat that loved attention. The neighbors weren't very good pet owners though. They neglected the poor thing and hardly feed him

A few weeks passed since I moved in and the neighbors decided to move. It took 3 days in total for them to pack up their stuff and leave. I noticed a couple days after they left their cat was still there wondering around outside in the rain looking pathetic. I kept him with me for a couple days hoping that they would come back for him; they didn't. Once I knew for sure that they wouldn't come back I checked with my landlord to see if I could keep him.

After signing some papers and paying a pet deposit the cat was mine. I decided to name him Crybaby because he was very vocal about everything

Skip forward to two months. I was in my room sleeping, at least not this early in the morning. Was he hungry?  Once I got out of bed and walked to the living room I became more alert. I didn't just hear my cat I also heard something else that made my stomach churn. Someone was was jimmying my locked front door as my cat watched.

For the longest time I couldn't move. I stood there in my living room paralyzed with fear. My thoughts raced and my heartbeat was loud in my ears. Sooner or later , anything to get person to leave. It took about a minute for me to collect my courage.I was about to do something reckless and possibly stupid.  I shakily walked to the door and moved my hand to the light switch next to it and turned on the outside light. This seemed to do the trick. Once the person knew I was home he proceeded to yell ""SON OF A BITCH! FUCK!"" After that outburst he kicked the door a couple times, which scared me even more and I  jumped back and fell on my ass. Then he stopped and everything went silent. 

Again

Sadly the cops never caught the guy. So he's still out there somewhere. And I hope to god that I **never** have to meet him. The one thing I am thankful for is that Crybaby is such a vocal cat and that he was able to wake me up that night. Weather that guy was able to break in or not

TL;DR My very vocal cat woke me up for me to find out that some guy was trying to break into my apartment. After that I found out that he tried to break into 4 other apartments as well.

I was fortunate enough to be born in the great Pacific Northwest, but also to collect a specific type of rock that when cut in half and polished would resemble a scenic picture of the view of mountains from within a cave. I do not recall the true name of these stones

The walk from the creek where we harvested these rocks to the dirt road wasn't particularly long

When I was about 14 I distinctly remember hauling a backpack full of these rocks up from the creek to my dads truck. Along the way I ran into a man that looked to be about 30 years old. We both appeared to be surprised that we would run into anyone in this rather remote section of the mountains, as if he was seeing a ghost. He didn't say anything as I passed, he just stared at me seemingly trying figure out the appropriate words ask me something. After passing him I remember thinking how much this guy looked like he could be in my family, the similarities were striking. I continued on to the truck, dumped my load of rock off at the truck and headed back down to the river to my dad. When I arrived I told him about the encounter and asked him if he had seen this man to which he replied that he hadn't. I have remembered this encounter quite vividly since then.

Last year I was visiting my family in Snohomish and decided to head up to old Goblin Creek for nostalgic purposes. It had been about 15 years since I was last up there. Along the way up there I found out that the Index-Galeema road had apparently washed out years before, about 14 years old. He was wearing a backpack that looked to be burdened by heavy weights. As we got closer, I began to get increasingly confused and shocked as the boy looked exactly like I did at his age. I meant to say something to him as he passed, but could not figure out the right words to express what I was thinking at the moment. He passed me and kept going. I walked a little ways and finally stopped when it all really hit me. I remembered the encounter from my teenage years and realized I had just lived the other half of the experience! Both the man and boy were me, roughly 15 years removed! I turned around to catch up to the boy in the thick Western Washington woods. I ran all the way back up to the road where my truck was to find...... nothing. There wasn't anywhere else besides the road for him to go to, and I hadn't stalled so long as to not be able to catch up to him. He was simply gone. Curiosity got the best of me so I hurried down to the creek half expecting to find my dad fishing on the bank 15 years younger but found nobody.

I ended up going home and deciding that this experience was too unbelievable to tell even my friends and family. I just wanted to get this out there to the wonderful Reddit community to see what others think and hopefully to see if anyone else has had this type of experience as well.

1370539308.0,1fsw4p,Haven't been camping since.,bearrwitness,511,66,74,"In May 2009 I had just broken up with my girlfriend of almost 3 years. We had moved from Calgary to Toronto

He grew up in an area about an hour outside of Toronto called Flamborough. Its really beautiful. Loads of lush forest, and drinking some quality craft beers. As it got darker we made a little fire and roasted potatoes and hotdogs. All in all it was a really good night. 

We turned in just after midnight
 
I nudged my buddy to see if he was awake, as we hadn't brought anything to scare off critters. Not a bb gun, nothing. Finally he decided he would shine the flashlight on it, and holler a lot, hopefully scaring him off. 

He unzipped the tent and I watched him pointing the flashlight out into the darkness. I'll never forget what happened next. His legs suddenly went all wobbly and he sort of stumbled backwards into the tent. He had a really dumbfounded look on his face when he looked at me and babbled ""its not a coyote, I won't even watch horror movies) but I've never seen someone look that scared. And i never want to see that expression on someones face again. So I knew he wasn't pulling my leg. The weird yipping and howling type noises were still going on and it retrospect..it really didn't sound like a coyote but I guess in our groggy states it was a way for our brains to make sense of it. Anyways he kept telling me just to look out the tent flap ""to make sure he's not crazy"". 

At this point I was having a full blown anxiety attack, but I had to look. So I slowly peeked out the flap and waited for my eyes to adjust and thats when I saw him. He was standing only a few arms lengths away from the tent. He was swaying a little, and wearing a baseball cap...what made it awful though, what was really creepy, was that he was wearing women's lingerie. That's when I knew there was most likely something very wrong with this guy (if the making high pitched noises at a strangers tent in the middle of the night didn't give it away). After I pulled my head back inside the tent my buddy and I discussed what to do. Finally we decided to yell at the guy to fuck off. My buddy started yelling ""EXCUSE ME CAN YOU FUCK OFF?? WE'RE TRYING TO SLEEP IN HERE."" The noise stopped, it was dead silent and thats when we heard footsteps running towards are tent. They stopped right outside the tent but we didn't waste anytime, we started yelling again ""SERIOUSLY FUCK OFF. WE HAVE CELL PHONES IN HERE IF YOU DON'T FUCK OFF WE'RE GOING TO CALL THE COPS."" With that we heard him walk by the tent and head off, petrified until the first sign of sunlight

We discussed our experience on the way home, or what was wrong with him. Sometimes I wonder if things would have turned out differently if we were a couple girls. I'm not saying he was some serial killer but..seemed like he was testing who was in the tent? Guess I'll never know! And for that I'm kind of glad.

A girl named Delaney moved in next door to me the weekend after my 9th birthday, and smart, even though she was 2 years below me.
A few weeks after she moved in, we made chalk bodies on the sidewalk in front of our houses. While she pretended to take forensic analysis, I pretended to jot down notes, because fuck yeah, CSI.   
A blue pick up went by. I decided it was going too fast, along with the car type and color, because I was strange. I told Delaney that something seemed weird on my paper.   
She looked and said that the blue pickup was there like 5 times.   
We shrugged it off and carried on.   
We made so many chalk bodies it was insane.   
Minutes passed, and told Delaney to go inside my house while I cleaned up. She didn't want to, but I bribed her with lemonade.   
I hosed down the sidewalk to clean the chalk and I picked up our things
The next day, and for 20 cents for a dixie cup, we made about 30 bucks in one hot day. Before we packed up, a blue pickup truck came around. I was really scared, but my mom was with us like a good parent, so I held her hand and grabbed Delaney's dress. He walked up to us in a long brown coat and hat, even though it was like 90 or something. He smelled like smoke. Not cigarettes
He bought 3 lemonades
""It's a real good thing you cleaned up all that chalk
He laughed and drove away.

So when my dad was roughly 9 or so, we're hanging out at a park in Massachusetts. It was summer and a hot day, and the year was 1968 I believe. As he and his cousins were trying to avoid the heat, a man meets them and introduces himself as Stanley Rice - a nice enough looking guy with a camera bag. They strike up conversation, and the heat comes up. Stanley mentions an old swimming hole he knows in a creek a little ways out of town, and offers to show them the way. Being naive children in the less-suspicious 60s, they agree

They walk and walk and walk

For the majority of the trip, he whispers to my dad, ""that bag has a totally different name on it. And he's got a pistol."" As this happens, they reach the swimming hole. They plan to break for it when Stanley gets in the water. Strangely enough, Stanley is already wearing swimming trunks as he strips his pants. He tells the boys to c'mon and join him as he dives in the water. 

They scatter and begin running as fast as they can back home. Having watched too many army shows

So they all escaped, and had 2 kids captive, bound in a van. So that's one of the near death stories my dad has in which I almost wasn't born.

1372074093.0,1gyos4,Older man tried to lure me into his home on several occasions.,blasphemicassault,504,62,35,"This happened when I was about 14 years old, which was about five minutes. 

One day the bus was a little more full than usual, I was on *public* transit, what could go wrong? He suddenly started inching closer to me, slightly rubbing his leg against mine. He got off at my stop, and proceeded to walk one way while I went the other, and that was the end of that.. or so I thought. 

The next few days he was always on that bus. I had never seen him on that bus before. I thought maybe he was coming from work or something, all asking me over, and tried to offer me candy and baked goods a couple times. He even started walking in the direction I did when walking home to 'see where I was going' one day. After that, I told my parents  (I know, I know, I should have done it earlier). 

My Dad wanted to talk to this man, so I did. I didn't acknowledge him when I got off the bus, and he saw for himself the actions unfold. The guy again asks me to come to his place and says he has a nice ""dinner planned for us"". I start walking in my direction when the man yells ""Don't you walk away from me, get back here!"" rather aggressivly, and starts trekking my way. That's when my Dad piped up and asked what the hell he was doing. The man replied with ""I'm getting my daughter to come home, but she won't listen to me!"". (You could tell I wasn't his daughter, given that I'm Caucasian and his skin was plenty darker) That's when my Dad lost it. He went on about the creepy things he's said to me, and how the man better not come near me ever again. The man went pale and took off.

1374743507.0,1j0nc1,She's Mine.,QuietDestiny,502,67,68,"I've been lurking here for a while and I have so many creepy encounters

I take care of my two nieces once a week for a full day. One of them is four and the other is two. They're both pretty as a picture with blonde hair and blue eyes and it's not uncommon for someone to comment on how cute they are, so it gives me some time to just sit while they play. This day in particular there were a few extra families there, since it was a pupil free day at school. I was keeping a close eye on the girls since I'm naturally cautious and this subreddit has gotten to me a bit (thank you for that!!).

The older girl (K) wanted to play on the swings while her sister (T) wanted to play on the slide on the other side of the park. Usually I would let them split up, T got tired and wanted to sit with me for a while. I took a seat near the swings to watch K playing. T curled up on my lap and starts to doze.

As I'm sitting there a man approaches me, kinda cute, blonde, blue eyes, the whole package. He sits down next to me and asks if T is mine. I tell him she's my niece. He asks if K is mine and I tell him also my niece.

At this point I'm not getting any bad vibes. I'll admit I was checking him out a little. He tells me how beautiful the girls are ""Like little angels"" and I ask him if he has a kid here. He says he likes watching them. A red flag went off in my head. I thought maybe he's some kind of behaviorist or something, but I shrug it off and go to check on K.

I carry T towards the swings, calling for her, but she doesn't answer. This is unusual, since usually she checks up on me more than I do her. Thoroughly terrified now, I run up to a group of mothers and ask if they've seen her. One of them says that she saw two men with a little girl like that. She said one looked like her father.

I want to scream. While he distracted me someone else must have taken her. I literally burst into tears. I'm out of my mind with terror and T freaks out too. The women suddenly realise what's happened and one of them calls the police

I'm going to say right now that I believe that someone or something was looking out for us that day. The police are there within minutes and then they're off searching. They find the guys just over a block away with the van's engine smoking like there's no tomorrow. They arrested them and bring K straight back to me. She's pretty upset, which is fine, since there is no way that I would have let her go.

The investigation continued and it turns out that the blonde guy had lost a daughter who he was trying to replace in his life. We filed a restraining order and he's not allowed in our town unless it's to attend court. K is fine now and often gets frustrated that we're all so over protective of her and T. We were so unbelievably lucky.

All of my interaction with my creeper happened on the Internet so I hope this is the right place for this.  And if this sounds a little disjointed I apologize

I had a friend that introduced me to a guy she new on the internet and I started instant messaging with him because she said he was a friend of a relative.  A lot of my friends were talking with him at the time and me and the friend even video chatted with him once.  I had a computer in my room at this time so I talked to him a lot more than my parents realized at the time.  

Well

My friend that introduced me to him was also going to run away with me and we were going to meet the guy in New York.  So we arrange it so that I can spend the night at her house that night so we can run away together.  That night we sneak our stuff outside and ""go out for a walk"". We were going to walk to the bus station and get tickets all the way up there. We walk a while but weren't going to make the bus so we looped back around to her house.  At this point she decides that she isn't going to go but convinces me that I should still go.  So in the morning I leave the note for my parents and call a taxi.  It picks me up and drives to the bus station.  The driver knew something was up and he was casually questioning me about where I was going and who I was going to meet.  

We got to the bus station and I go inside to buy my ticket.  I'm sitting there as the clerk is getting my ticket ready and my Dad pulls up like a bat out of hell.  To this day I am grateful I left that note.  He had a hunch that I was going to the bus station and drove so fast that his astro van was on two wheels at some points.  My dad gets me and my stuff and we head home.  

At this point I realize just how stupid I had been and break down.  My parents ask me all the questions about what was going on and why.  They also call the cops.  

A few months go by and an FBI agent calls them wanting to talk to me and take the computer.  My Mom and I talk to the agent for a while and he informs us that they believe they have this same guy in custody right now for luring other girls to him.  He showed me his photo and I ID him as the same guy.  He takes my computer but they don't find anything on it but a few conversations since the ""friend"" that introduced me to him had wiped it pretty good.  Luckily they didn't need me in court to convict this guy

To this day I am grateful that I left that note and that my Dad listened to his instincts and found me before I got on that bus.  I also found out that that cab driver waited outside where I couldn't see him because he figured out I was a run away,False,,t5_2t3t8,1369928243.0,,,t3_1fbwgh

My mum and I moved into a completely normal/average house when I was about 15. Everything was fine, they were all OK with that. Apparently he came from some sort of broken home and they all felt sorry for him so they didn't call the police. Mum and I were completely unsettled by that and put new locks on all the doors that week. We didn't care if the other neighours were OK with that... We weren't.

A few months pass and nothing ever happens again, I didn't have a nightmare... I just woke up. I had this incredibly uneasy and weird feeling wash over me. I felt like something or someone was watching me and I got completely freaked out. I went into my mum's room and slept in her bed that night. It kept happening a few nights and I thought I was just having nightmares or was getting scared of the dark for some reason. I ended up sleeping in my mums bed for about a week because I was so legit scared of the dark now. I finally worked up the courage to sleep in my own bed one night, but I could barely sleep. I felt totally uneasy and nervous/scared. I got to sleep for a bit but then I woke up again. I looked outside my window and I could SWEAR I saw face/figure of someone standing there. Obviously, I nope'd the fuck out and ran back to my mum. 

One of the nights I was back in her bed, our dog is an old golden retriever and has never growled or barked at ANYTHING. She is a huge wuss and completely placid, she has no problem with strangers, even if someone knocks on the door and comes in, she couldn't care less.* So I wake up, all dazed, confused and half asleep. I hear the dog growling and I'm asking her ""what's wrong...?"". I look up from the bed and I shit you not - there is a man standing in the door way... With a knife. I screamed like a banshee and the dog started barking at this point. Mum woke up and saw the man too... He went running down the hallway and out the back door. I'm crying my eyes out, the dude is gone. Morning comes and we go outside to see that the back gate has had its lock cut with bolt cutters

We moved out that **same day** and went to live with my grandma and grampa until we found a new house. Pretty much no one in the family believed us, ""Oh yeah, that's the Milat kid."" Wait... Did they just say, **MILAT**? Yeahhhh... Pretty much any Australian will know this last name... [Ivan Milat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacker_Murders). The serial killer. His NEPHEW was breaking into people's homes... And our home. While we were sleeping. WITH A KNIFE.  And people were OK with that.

To start things off as soon as I got into his truck he asked me why I was out here all alone

It was around 7pm when he picked me up an on the way back about 30 minutes in he asked it I wanted to get something to eat from McDonald's, I got my food and returned to the truck and tried to keep to myself, I just wanted the ride to be over with.

After sitting there in silence for awhile I hear the strangest sentence someone has ever heard to me ""if you sit there and act like a deer, and said something about how her walls of her room was blue. This was good to hear because I figured he wouldn't want to rape me or anything. 

A bit later he pulled out his shitty flip phone, I did. The first thing he did when I scooted closer was throw his arm over my shoulder faster then I could process what happened, he said it was hard to show me the videos on his phone and drive so it was easier.

The first video he showed me was of some Mexican man or something sitting at a police station looking like he was waiting to be processed in

I told him that is messed up and not funny at all. He let out the most manic laughter I have ever heard. I tried to scoot back but he had a stiff arm to the side of me that I could tell was not going to move. He told me he had better videos. The next one was of a girl being fucked by a horse, was a video of a vagina, looked normal at first until the girl reached her hand into her vagina and took out a huge fish. Literally reached in, and took out a bass or catfish or something, it was a big one. 

After we neared the town I lived in he asked where my apartment was not knowing how old I was, I didn't pay him and I didn't see how he couldn't drive 10 more minutes but I didn't care. I got out and he pulled off. My phone was dead so I proceeded to just walk the rest of the way and make it home. As soon as I walked in my dad asked where I had been and who brought me home, I told him the story and about the creepy truck drier and how I felt terrified. He told me the tow truck service he called had notified him that I wasn't there when they sent out a driver.

I tried to think the best, the girls seemed uncomfortable and I was on red alert. He ended up stepping away and the girls were sort of going over the conversation and trying to figure out if they should go or not. I said to them ""Do you know him?"" My blood ran cold when they said no. 

We sprang into action and one of my friends went to walk a few feet over and write down his license plate number. I flat out said to them ""You're not going with him and to get away from the gate"" they did as they were told and stood near my other friends (who is more maternal) who helped them not be so freaked out.

This happened about 3 years ago when I was 16. I had left highschool and was working in a hair salon. That's where I met one of my best friends

So one weekend I went around to his place for a few drinks. I met his mum who was lovely. She was only 36

We were at the pub for about an hour when a few of Adams friends showed up with a girl called Jay. I don't want to sound rude but when I first met Jay I honestly thought she was a man. She was very androgynous, and I remember wondering (not in a mean way) why she was hanging out with Adams friends as they're all massive fashionistas with barbed tongues and no qualms in calling out fashion disasters. 

I excused myself to go to the ladies room and when I got back Jay had moved around in the seats so I would be forced to sit next to her at the end of the table

She sat really close to me

The conversation was normal and at this point my creeper radar wasn't dinging. She mentioned she was from South Africa and moved here a few years ago with her mother. She told me she was a lesbian and I asked if I was too. I told her I was Bisexual but was seeing a man. 

This is when she went off on a big tirade against Bisexuals. If you're Bisexual you will know what I'm talking about. Either you're actually a lesbian and too scared to come out or you're actually strait

After a few more beers Adam, have a shower and see how we feel. Adam didn't have a cell phone at the time so I jotted down mine on a piece of paper and handed it to one of the boys. 

About 5 minutes into the taxi ride I got a text message. ""R u coming to the party?"" we had JUST agreed to give them a call if we felt like coming later on so I was a little annoyed with being hounded and didn't text back. 

20 minutes later, WOAH. At this point I still thought it was Adams friend, the one I actually gave my number to. He's a flaming gay so naturally I assumed it was a badly placed joke? Whatever. I texted back something like ""Not as sexy as you Mr. Fabulous pants.""

Big Mistake. 

My phone beeped again. ""It was nice meting u

It was Jay. Fuck. Up until this point I had just put everything down to cultural differences

I showed Adam and his mum the text and we all agreed the best thing I could do was to ignore the texts and hope she gives up. I turned off my phone and after that there was no way I was in the mood to go anywhere. We stayed in

Cut to a few days later and I was at a work function/party when I get a call from an unknown number. I answered it think it might be a client. A lot of my bosses clients work really late so often call to book in after hours

The woman on the other end asked if she could have a date. I had almost forgotten about Jay and nothing the person on the phone said seemed out of the ordinary. Just asking if she could book in a date to be 'serviced.' Of course you can Ma'am
""It's Jay

I hung up the phone immediately and ran into the bathroom, turned my phone off and was determined to power through the evening. No crazy bitch was going to stop me being awesome at my job, godamnit. I'm a strong, fabulous career orientated woman. FABULOUS I say!

Cut to the end of the evening, guess who came out of the bushes? That's right. Motha fuckin' Jay. That's not even an exaggeration. She was sitting IN the bushes, WAITING for me to come to the train station. 

I only froze for half a second before I started power walking towards the train. I ran across the road

I was at my wits end. I had no idea what to do. I certainly wasn't going to let her follow me on the train. There was no way I was going to be in a confined space with this she devil, people were looking and the ticket officer was trying to calm me down. The poor man pulled me into his office, made me a cup of tea while I waited for the police. They showed up after about 10 minutes and I told them everything and showed them the text messages. There was about 50 more since I had turned off my phone at the function. I couldn't even bring myself to read them and the police officer told me that was probably a good idea. Ugh. 

Since she hadn't physically hurt me the police told me there was not a lot they could do but file a restraining order. I didn't know her last name

I changed my phone number and asked for a few days off work. My boss was really understanding and I spent two days locked in my room with a giant tub of ice cream

Skip to a week later and I get a call from the police to come down to the station. They had arrested a woman who had claimed I was her girlfriend

Someone had called in about a suspicious looking man (lol) hanging around the train station, and was heading back to jail.

Of course that night the game went into extra innings and so I didn't get a chance to drop my friend off back home until well after 1 a.m. Everything was fine on the way home until I hit a light right before the street that led to my house. It was a ""T"" junction and I was turning left. The light is one of those that you think is broken until it finally turns green right when you finally decide to just run it. Of course I pulled up right as the light turned red.

I would have just run the light, that was the night I decided to prove to myself that I was a man of character, big mistake.

I pulled to a stop at the light feeling good about myself, so I could just get out of there, I knew there was a slim chance of that.

She walked right up to my window, but she did not seem to notice or care. She then leaned in and began to talk.

She said, can you give me a ride?""

I should stop and give a brief physical description of the bag lady. She was small and skinny and of indeterminate age. She was either in her mid twenties and had lived a hard 20+ years on the street, there was no way to verify her story. She looked beat up by life, not just by a boyfriend. But there was something about her delivery, it was robotic and seemed practiced and like she was disconnected from the moment, that made my skin crawl, and after a brief (about a second) debate on whether I should do it, I told her that I had to get home and could not give her a ride.

After my first refusal she leaned in closer and said the same thing again, can you give me a ride?"" This time I felt more confident when I declined to give her a ride and told her I had a curfew and had to get home.

She leaned in a third time and began her statement again, leaned in closer and said five words that have haunted me ever since, ""You made the right decision"". Then she picked up her bag and walked back towards the bench.

I made a group of friends pretty easily, Kristin, and I became rather close. We had classes together, we had sleepovers together, we went to the school dances together... 

I was an amateur photographer in high school

But, but I never saw him. I shrugged it off, and I kept taking couple pictures and the stereotypical ""let's all get in a line and put our hands on our hips"" picture. 

I finally saw him. He was standing behind some trees at the edge of the yard taking pictures... which seems normal enough

I just ignored the feeling that had me ready to leave and finished my job. My mom came to pick me up, I saw him standing in the middle of the street taking pictures of my mom's car as we drove off. I told her that he was just trying to get pictures of all of the friends, even the ones not going to prom.

All of this should have been a red flag

Well, so I jumped on the opportunity. Her house was incredibly large and beautiful-- the only people who lived there were her mom, who was wheelchair bound and never left her room, her dad, and herself. 

The day itself wasn't too eventful, but I'm not sure. I got pretty creeped out as soon as I woke up because one of the walls of the room was just a bunch of windows with no curtains or blinds.  I decided to go to the bathroom so I could be in a room with some light and calm myself down. I couldn't remember which room was the bathroom, so I slowly cracked open a door down the hall that I thought might be it... but I was wrong.

It was a darkroom. Not dark as in no light

I started panicking... I had no idea what to do. I just wanted to leave immediately. I went back to the living room and decided to call my mom to come get me. I didn't explain anything on the phone or wake up Kristin, he just stood there staring at me. I quickly put my top on, and then just stood there not moving.

We continued to stand like that until I got text from my mom saying she had pulled into the driveway. I grabbed my bag

I never told anyone about what happened

After the summer had ended

Edit 1: Spelling/typos  

Edit 2: There was a request for me to elaborate on the hug at the end. Kristin's mother was seriously ill, but only if I could bring my older sister. I didn't want to be around them by myself, but I did want to pay my respects to the always oblivious mother and send my well-wishes to Kristin's grandparents because they were always really sweet to both me and Kristin.

My older sister and I went to the viewing, and Kristin's dad approached me. He gave me a long, long, long, awkward hug where he rubbed his hand up and down my back (from my shoulders down to the top my butt, and whispered about how beautiful I looked and how I'd always be his favorite of Kristin's friends, that I was special to him, etc.. At his wife's funeral!! I nearly passes out from the panic after that encounter

Some people asked why I never told my mom/anyone-- I don't really have a good answer. For a while I thought that it might all be exaggerated in my head and I didn't want to cause issues in their family if it was innocent. I obviously realize that it wasn't innocent now

Our delivery area includes a few new development ""upper middle class"" cookie cutter neighborhoods (Bad tips), some trailer parks (Great tips or no tips), and a bunch of rural areas (Usually good tips). Not rural to the point seeing hundreds of stars at night, but enough that you couldn't hear your neighbors yell. 



So about a week ago I was covering a delivery shift, and check to see if I have anymore deliveries. I have one to an address I have never seen before (we have mostly semi regulars get deliveries so an address that doesn't seem the least bit familiar is odd) its out on one of the more rural roads, I ask the kid who took the order what was up because there were special instructions on the ticket. He says, ""They said go around back because the front door is not operational."" I'm like ok that's not *that* uncommon, people often want you to go around back, either they painted the door, the house shifted and its a bitch to open



So as I'm driving out to the house and I get an odd feeling



As I am driving to the house I realize its towards the end of this road that gets less populated the further down you go, I think, ""that house better not be it"" so I drive passed and check the next houses' address and lo and behold, that abandoned looking one was the right house....*shit*. At this point I am not super worried though because out in the boonies the standards of upkeep on your house are pretty low so a house in disrepair isn't unusual. 



So I double back to this house and pull into the drive way



While I am on the phone I take a chance to take a good look at the house. It looks extremely abandoned and not just in disrepair. The driveway is crumbling, no car, no lawnmowers, no landscapaing, no kids toys, absolutely nothing in the yard. The yard hasn't been mowed in what looks like years, the house is total crap, the siding *is* falling apart



At this point I am starting to get pretty nervous, but I did take karate for 10 years, so I'm not helpless, but I do try to avoid any sort of confrontation I can as I am mostly a pacifist. I'm not too concerned about getting robbed, no skin off my teeth its not my money. I mean I would rather not get robbed, but I'm mostly worried about getting jumped, or killed, but more worrying a few stabbings and assaults. 



So its time to either nut up or shut up. I'm not just going to go charging in there like a fool so I get out my phone and call the number they gave when ordering



I am starting to walk up to the house while the phones ringing; it rings twice and then an automated message comes on. It says something along the lines of this phone number is associated with a internet texting app (one the free ones you download and let you send free texts from a different phone number over a data connection) I think it was Heywire. We have had issues with people using numbers from those services for pranks in the past. 



This is huge red flag, with a hat pulled low and big sunglasses on is looking out. Remember he is in a completely dark house surrounded by trees, at dusk, there is no reason for him to be wearing sunglasses, I also see what appears to be a big guy standing behind him in the room, this could have been anything though. When he sees me looking me mouths something and he darts away presumably towards the allegedly broken front door. At this point I noped the fuck out. I had stayed pretty close to my car so it was only a few steps away so I jumped into the driver's seat and throw the pizza into my passenger seat, something I would never do since I am really anal about keeping my car clean. I slam it into reverse, again something I never do. 



Without looking I simultaneously slam and lock my door, the screen door on the outside of the front door is now open but the front is still shut. The guy isn't out in the yard yelling wait come back or anything, he's just gone. So I pull over a little ways up the road to call back to shop and tell them I'm all good and I'll elaborate when I get back. 



The people never called back to inquire about their food, but it was still very unnerving, that I easily *could have* gotten into some serious trouble by just doing my job. Especially if the idiots picked a slightly less abandoned house to set up at.

1340305793.0,ve8zw,[Comp] My schizophrenic neighbor,taheca,452,57,51,"My wife and I purchased our house about 6 years ago

One neighbor is a single mom

It became apparent one day though that something was wrong. We started seeing different things sprinkled around her house. Fake plastic flowers tied to her mailbox, and they all feared she had stopped taking her medication.

Over the period of a couple of weeks she began acting more and more erratic. She would peel out of her driveway in her car, and would come up to various neighbors and give them random presents (a rock, shiny stone, plastic toy, etc).

One evening I go out on one of my regular walks and I can instantly tell something is up. Her car is parked sideways on her driveway. Every exterior and interior light was on in and around her house

Suddenly I saw her sprint across the street to my side of the street, very slowly turned around and started to walk back across the street. 

I thought about calling the police

Now I don't have any direct experience working with people during breakdowns

She immediately was friendly and said hi, but still did not feel like I was in danger. I was really more worried that she was a danger to herself.

I continued talking and she suddenly said, and I am much larger than her (not that it means anything I guess when a person is out of their mind, but figured If I was cautious it would be ok).

I entered her house and literally walked into a nightmare.  The place was trashed

Suddenly she went full on with manic behavior.  Started explaining how the different piles were different cities

Honestly I should not have been there but I had just finished up two years of studying human development, she was so glad to have some company.

I started to quickly scan her house looking for weapons, her clothes were everywhere.

I went into her master bedroom and honestly did try to set up the DVD player while she randomly walked around the house talking.  Even though the TV was like mine

During this time I noticed that she had set the knives down and  I quickly folded them up and pocketed them. I apologized to her that I could not get the DVD player to work

I scanned the upstairs and saw no more knives or weapons

Not seeing any more weapons I went back downstairs to double check the kitchen but she was watching me now, and that she might want to stay inside now. She agreed with me.

I left and when finally outside realized that I had just walked into her madness

The next day was Mother's day. I found out later that her husband's parents had taken her kids away from her a week before that due to her erratic behavior. With Mother's day approaching she just lost it even more.

Eventually she went away and came back about a month later

I still live down the street from her, but she has no emotion, no personality.  She lost her husband and her children to her disease, but the big unknown is where she gets her money (leading theory is very wealthy parents). She used to be a corporate buyer for a large corporation buying large lots of goods all over the country (which I believe is tied into the various cities she formed in her house with her things).

She had another episode about a year ago

She is back to being fine now

UPDATE 07/23/2013 - Her teenage son was just killed while out Skateboarding at night... she is off her medication.. as if the tragedy could not get any worse.. She came over to see me and broke down crying in my arms. This is such a tragedy

I was not working, had decided to run some errands with her girls and so it was myself and my infant at home alone.

Let me say that they lived in a nice

Anyway, a stairway separating them. I had heard what sounded like rattling, and got up to look out the window, thinking my sister-in-law was home and needed help carrying in bags, but found nothing, so I unlocked the door because my husband, brother

 I was in the great room, so thought maybe I had just thought I heard something in the background of the movie and had not, in fact, heard anything real, so I ignored it and went back to my movie.

Less than a half-hour later

My brother starts talking really fast that he and my husband had pulled up to overhear his next-door neighboor on his phone out front

After a good hour or two we found out that while that during the time when I heard the rustling sound out my front window and then what sounded like a scream

The following information is inside police knowledge we found out from a detective working the case who happened to know my brother and is graphic to some extent:

Apparently, Chyna in the master bedroom putting clothes away. The step-son was down the hall in his room. The murderer then proceeded to use some form of a knife to basically start slashing and hacking at Chyna spraying her blood all over the room and down the hall as she tried to escape. They believe she must have yelled for her step-son to run and call the police because they found him near the front entry of the house. When the father got home what he found was his wife's body near the bottom of the stairs, a blood trail, and some of her organs strewn from the master bedroom upstairs down the hall and downt he stairs, with her hand prints on the step-son's doorway and in a manner like she was reaching out for help. The son was found in the entry, having been trying to escape, he was missing fingernails from digging them into the flooring;blood was everywhere. The front door was not totally ajar, as if he had almost made it outside before the killer reached him.  In addition the investigators said that the wife had been molested in a violent manner with what was believed to be a broom stick.  Also

The police speculate, hearing the television on, but found it locked and so walked past his camper (the wheels with the wood were closest tot he garage) and picked up the chunk of wood while walking next door. That door was unlocked and murder ensued.

I had nightmares and couldn't sleep for weeks, and I believe, had I walked in and unlocked that door even minutes earlier than I chose to, it would have been myself and my infant that were murdered.

Still scares the shit out of me when I think of it. 

Edit: I had a couple people question whether the man was outside when he called 911 or inside by his son

Also, and when I returned from my errand less than 20 minutes later he was leaving his driveway and waved at me. Also, his reaction after his initial bought of throwing up and calling 911 was very odd for someone who family was murdered. There is rumor that the police had evidence of his involvement but because of the lack of murders in the area, ever, that they botched the evidence and couldn't use it. I do NOT know if that is true or not, just hearsay. Anyway, if anyone has questions regarding any of the details, etc were around feel free to PM me,False,

I had just started working at Wal-mart in the Hardware department. As a female, or mixing paint. I rarely knew anything when it came to answering handy-man work. Also note

It started the first Saturday I ever worked there. I had the early morning shift, Ron, who had started the same day as me. 

A man came in looking for a few different items. He was an Indian man (said he was from India

He completely bypassed Ron and went straight to me for help. I showed him to the products he was requesting when the questions started. I answered politely with a standard

He started spouting off random stuff he was trying to do around his house, with my back to him looking at different products, that's when I felt him creep up behind me and grab my ass. In my mind, I tried to play it off as an accident. Until he did it two more times, as well as brush my chest at least 3 times. 

I kept inching away as best as I could, Ron would help him out. But we didn't see him again that day. 

I worked the same shift the next day

""Do you like what you see?"" he asked. 

""Um. I...have...to go get something from the stock room."" And I darted off. 

I took that time to talk to a manager about this man. I was clearly upset by him, and she basically told me to suck it up and deal with it. ""Customer satisfaction is our number one goal."" I didn't realize I had to satisfy them that way!

I never saw him on the weekdays,  that day, but he had a meeting in the morning to attend. So I was basically alone in the department. The man dragged me to the tool aisle because he wanted a new hammer and nails so he could build a bird house. 

The grabbing and brushing started up again, asked me what was going on. I wasn't comfortable telling him my story, I didn't know him. But he asked me if the creeper was harassing me during store hours, and I just gave a slight nod. 

David walked off, Eric, and the head of AP (LP in other stores), Bobby. David explained to the two what he witnessed, how wrong it was for Wal-mart to let this happen, and demanded they rectify the situation before I was hurt. 

Eric thanked David and him and Bobby pulled me into the office. Eric did all the talking. 

""Is this true?""

""Yes...""

""How long has it been going on?""

""He started last Saturday and came back Sunday. I didn't see him again until today.""

""Why didn't you tell anyone before? Why did a customer bring it to management's attention?""

""I tried. I told Christina. She told me to get over it and help the guy no matter what.""

Neither of them looked happy at that.
""Could you point him out on the security footage?""

""Sure.""

So I went in the AP room with them. We rewinded the tapes and I pointed him out from that day. Only problem was, and Bobby said he would warn all his AP peeps. 

I worked the next day again, it was the creeper. ""Oh good, you are there. I'm on my way. I'm taking you out to lunch. No ifs, ands, or buts about it you sexy girl."" I let out an eek! and hung up the phone on him. 

However, and let me know the police were already called and on their way. About 5 minutes later, the creeper showed up. He literally ripped me away from another lady I was helping at the moment, and tried dragging me to the exit in the tire center.

After one of those nights of heavy drinking, Carmen (maids are a lot cheaper more common for middle class families in Mexico). I entered and lied down on the first couch I saw. I started drifting into Morpheus' embrace when I was woken up by the phone ringing. Carmen answered, and about a minute later came to give me the phone. I could see in her eyes that something was not right. Her hand was shaking as she handed me the handset. ""I think someone has La Señora..."" she said in a tiny voice. ""What?"" I said, incredulous as I put the phone to my ear. 

On the line was a woman screaming in agony. I couldn't understand what she was saying, who said in a threateningly calm voice: ""We've got your mom. We've already cut off one of her fingers."" At this point my vision became all black with rage and anguish, and I started to lose my grip on reality. Do you guys have any idea how it feels like to know that your mother, the woman who has been there for you all your life, is being tortured in some dark room somewhere in the largest city in the world? I hope you never find out. 

The man demanded money, and I kept pleading to the man to wait until my father gets home, he has money. At that point, I was in tears, living some of the worst moments of my life, when all of a sudden I heard the door of the house open, and with unfathomable relief, angelic voice of my mother as she yelled at my dad to grab something from the car. I ran downstairs and hugged her so hard. ""What happened? How did you escape?"" I yelled ""Chinga tu madre puto!"" into the handset and hung up. The guy tried calling again right away but we just hung up.

Turns out I was the victim of a scam that had just become common in Mexico where people would call random phones and pretend to have kidnapped a family member.

Growing up, have my phone, take a flashlight, and she set the parameters for where I was allowed to go. She gave me about 4 miles, which was a lot to me. So right after the sun set, I was off.

I loved it. There were no people out walking their dogs, etc.. It was really fun, so fun, that I ignored the limits my mom set. You see, where I was biking was all walking paths. It was one of those grassy areas between two neighborhoods. There's this long path that went at least 600 feet at a 25 degree angle. I was flying down this hill, having an absolute blast, and darted right through the parameters.

My mom set these limits for a reason. Everything on the inside was close to houses and people. The outside, was barren. I rode along this path for 10 minutes before I could only see some of the lights of the houses on the inside of the limits.

After 15 minutes of riding along this dirt path, your voice gets scratchy? That's what her voice sounded like.

I inch forward to try and see her. I get close enough to see the silhouette of hair bouncing up and down, and turn it on.

The moment the light hit her, bright red hoodie. I was almost too scared to move. I think she was, too. I conjured up as much bravery as I could and said ""Sorry"" in a very, oops-this-is-the-wrong-room, kind of way. She didn't respond.

I turned off the flashlight and put it back in my pocket. Just as I was turning my bike around, high pitched voice. I damn near shit myself as I throw myself back onto my bike.

This happened last week when I finished my shift in the evening (8pm)

A few minutes into my walk I have to cross a bridge over the motorway
I could feel something or someone around me
I kept the music off though
A few seconds later I heard rustling behind me

 Ten minutes later and I'm nearing home and am laughing to myself about how silly and paranoid I was. At this point I'm as relaxed as I can be

I looked behind me (I hadn't heard anything, and had greasy black hair that hung around his face. He was dressed all in black. 
The creepiest part was that he looked dead behind the eyes. He was staring directly at me and there was nothing there. Just blank.

I turned back round and started walking at speed down the park

The creeper carried on following me, still completely dead behind the eyes. I contemplated heading somewhere else and trying to lose him but at this point I was terrified and just wanted to get to the safety of my house.
As my house came into view I decided to just run for it (which I should've done sooner evidently)

I got to my door and rummaged through my bag for my keys

The front door has glass panels, and I couldn't see him. 
I thought he'd gone. With my heart still racing I got my phone out of my bag and headed downstairs to call the non emergency number. 

As I walked into my living room his face was pressed up against the glass peering into my house and we made eye contact. Dead eyes again. I let out quite the scream and ran back upstairs. I called the emergency number. 
As I waited for the police the creeper had taken a seat in my garden

The police came within ten minutes and picked him up

Turns out creeper is an in patient in the psychiatric ward of my hospital. From what I've found out since he'd had a bit of a fascination with me from seeing me around the hospital doing my job. Some people I know in the psychiatry unit tell me he'd been mentioning his ""girlfriend"" recently &amp; they all thought it was another patient. They now think he was talking about me. 
He's been moved to another hospital now
I do hope he gets better

I had one friend in particular who I met at a community website, my parents allowed him to call me on our land line. We were very close,and he called me almost every night. 

He was very odd, but because we spoke so frequently, I got used to this. We sent each other art work, and even friendship bracelets. But we never met in person. 

As time went on, so I couldn't call/text. He lived off of state aid in an efficiency apartment. We would only email once in awhile, but few and far between. 

At some point, and she also had difficulty keeping in contact with him. I had no other information to give her, but her and I began a good friendship and still text regularly. She told me a lot that surprised and saddened me. Namely that he suffered a lot of physical and sexual abuse from their stepfather. (She found out years later) This added to the mental instability he had, obviously. 

Then, and while doing my duties, was also on Facebook. He signed in, and we IMed for a few hours. We hadn't spoken much in the past two years, so we caught up. I told him where I was working and living, my gf and I had gotten our own place, etc. He had lost his state aid and was living with his grandmother. I gave him my cell number

About two months later, lanky man walking around across the street. My first thought was he was homeless, which is odd, because we have a very low homeless rate in my city, and many shelters. He stuck out to me, his clothes were dark and tattered, his hard long and dark. Something in my gut told me it was my friend. I hadn't seen a picture of him since he was about 15, about a half hour later. He avoided eye contact

However, (""thanks for calling so&amp;so, this is Rachel, how may I help?"") After I confronted him and we spoke, I was able to gauge that he had decided to travel and stopped here, in-between. He didn't tell me his final destination, but I knew he didn't know anyone else in my city, who said she'd trust my opinion. 

We showed him around the city, on the couch. All of it, right out of the container.) and even later showed him to a casino. He wanted to leave because there were too many cameras. We both acknowledged this was odd, but assumed it was a part of one of his disorders and complied.

We set him up on the couch, because it was a hot day, and I guess he walked all over until he found my job while NOT wearing any deodorant. He wasn't gonna stink up my couch,man.) My g.f casually asked what he had in his pack back. She worried for his safety as he eluded he'd be hitchhiking and traveling by foot, and hoped he had the right supplies. He showed us what was in his backpack. Art supplies, some rope. Fingernail clippers. A bag of his own hair. (You read that right.) And a gallon of olive oil that he planned on drinking. (Read that right, too.) 

Later in bed, and I was still in shock of meeting someone out of the blue that I had only known online for so many years. 
She then informed me that while I was switching the wash around,(when he initially contacted me) he fell back into his old ways. My gf immediately knew what he was saying.

So we woke early, wrapped like a burrito and face down. 

I later found out from his sister that night when I called her to tell her about these events

No one knew where he was until last month, and it, ""didn't excite him in ways that they think,"" and that he was embarrassed and scared. I told him he needed to turn himself in, and not to call me again. (They don't confiscate your computer if you just looked once. This was continual use and downloading. Suffice to say, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't have had so much.)

We just let one guy that we know from our church move in. He's a smart man, nothing too severe. If he's on his medication, he's usually fine, but sometimes he refuses to take them. It's about 2:00 AM when he knocks on our door (Note that my parents are on a road trip 5,000+ KM away) and asks for a ride to WSU. We talk for a  little bit when he starts giggling constantly. It's a high pitched, quiet giggle and it's like he knows something I don't. I'm getting quite nervous when I suddenly realize that he's not on his medication. At this point I ask him to leave, and he complies and goes to the basement. A little while later, but I stay in the bathroom till 6:30, so he goes home in frustration.

Just a little info about me: I'm 26, playing in the dirt. I have never touched a Barbie in my life!

Back in the summer of 2002 (I was 16 at the time), boating, swimming -- the works. I was in paradise!

They had an RV

Sidenote: We are out in the middle of the woods

The next day was probably the funnest day of my life. We all went kayaking (which

It seemed like the day flew by. Before I knew it

I remember laying awake, and I laughed as quietly as I could. He snored VERY loud. I got one last laugh before, literally, my life was changed forever.

There was a tap on the side of the RV. It caught me off guard

I tried to sleep, and I was thinking to myself, ""Please, God, let me fall asleep soon.""

Silence washed over the place. I hear the river. The ringing in my ears you get when it's dead silent. I had this sinking feeling in my stomach; I hear people say they get it when something bad is about to happen. I felt it at that moment.

In the dead silence

Someone was outside the RV, but he just kept snoring. 

I was laying about five feet away from the main door (although, hoping no one would come through.

More silence. My heart is being so fast. I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack. I tap my chest to try and calm myself.

As I'm watching the square hole in the door, no doubt. I could see those fake press-ons and know them from any Wal-Mart store.

But that still didn't stop me from almost shitting my pants. I sit up

Boyfriend's dad goes to open the door, falling onto the couch. Out cold. A rock falls onto the floor. 

And that's when boyfriend wakes up, in shock. Boyfriend is flipping his shit, and I eventually stop screaming.

When I stop screaming

""We're on the roof, and we were just NOW starting to get into the cell phone craze, but we had all magically managed to abstain somehow.

The RV is rocking with someone jumping up and down

The dad manages to sober up

Everything goes silent. 

I turn to look at my boyfriend. There's a window behind him. And I see the face; a hood drawn over his face. I know it was a man because I could make out the outline of a beard on his face

The man raised a gloved hand and waved at me. I pulled my boyfriend away from the window and start screaming. The dad runs inside

We drove out of the camp site that night with a broken window. My boyfriend's dad went to the hospital with a minor concussion where the rock hit him. (Don't worry

The parents called the police the next morning and officers went out and searched the area. They didn't find anything. No other reports were ever filed after us.

I had to go through counseling and therapy

Eventually, some girlfriend and I decide to go to the movies. There was a new one out called *The Strangers*. I decided to go, because I had no homework. Turns out it was scarily like the experience I went through, and I ended up having a panic attack in the middle of the theater and had to go to the hospital.

A few months after THAT

As of 2012, and if you knock on my door in the middle of the night, you better have a damn good explanation as to why you're there. Also, stay the fuck off my roof.

Thanks for being here

Because of this, as we were often too lazy to put away our clean clothes.  We were also a very open family

During a particularly rainy season, around the perimeter of our home as well as through our yard.  We were all freaked out but there really wasn't much the police could do aside from occasionally patrol the area.  We forgot about the foot prints over the next few weeks and didn't think much of aside from locking all doors and windows.  One night I was standing in the laundry room arguing with my sister about who got to use the computer when 
I thought I saw a face against the window

My mother ordered blinds to be installed and we hid from the laundry room, my mother was doing laundry and caught the face of someone she recognized to be a neighbor catty-corner to us that had a husky.   She wasn't 100% that it was him, but he had pretty distinguishable moles on his face.  The police were contacted, and I'm not entirely sure what came of that situation, but I don't know if there was enough evidence to really hold him accountable.

Throughout my teenage years I saw this neighbor often, and then walk away.  I often caught him turning around to stare at me when he thought I wasn't looking, which makes me cringe because I always felt as though he was remembering me in my underwear.  During my senior year in highschool, I was able to borrow a car to drive to school so I no longer had to ride the bus.  On my last day waiting for the school bus, the man walked by with his husky and said hello.  I turned to him and said ""All those years ago, I knew it was you.""  He froze for a moment, looked surprised, smiling.

This happened last year, misc. food items, etc. After that, I just chilled until my shift ended, which was usually around 10 PM.

It was my first day (or night

I finished in about 45 minutes. I sat around

The kitchen area was huge. It wrapped around half of the building

When I looked, until I jumped up and turned the lights on. 

I was immediately staring into a pair of eyes. It was Roger, and I had had a few classes with him. He was a sweetheart, but I think he wasn't all ""there."" He just seemed off, but he always said hello to me, and I to him. 

But I remember asking him, laughed, and shrugged. He didn't say words, and I was creeped the fuck out. Then he told me he had heard I had got a job there, and he wanted to ""keep me company.""

I told him I was fine. He didn't leave right away, and I was happy to give him that. But the end of my shift came, and I told Roger that I was leaving. I only had to go down to the basement level and turn off the heating/air unit (which is what people in charge of inventory did as part of closing procedures). Roger said his goodbyes, then left. I went downstairs without thinking about it.

Later, heavy footsteps, and then Roger is standing at the top of the stairs. He told me there was a strange man outside and that he'd walk me to my car. I stopped, hesitated, then nodded. I trusted Roger. He was harmless... or so I thought. 

I sent a text to my boyfriend and told him I was on my way home. My phone (conveniently enough) died right after that text was sent. I gathered my things, retraced my steps, and spent an extra 30-45 minutes looking. Roger joined in to help. He pretended like it was a game and was laughing about it the entire time. I was growing uncomfortable - and agitated because I couldn't find my fucking wallet. 

As Roger bent down to look under a table, and he held it out in front of me like I was a fucking dog. 

I thought to myself, and hauled ass out of the door. I turned around, and was instantly barreled over by Roger. I hit the pavement outside the dining hall hard enough to daze me. He was laughing, and my vision was spinning. 

I pulled myself up. Roger was pushing me around, and I just got up and ran across the parking lot. He was much larger than me and much faster. He ran along beside me and just laughed. The fucker laughed. I didn't even run to my car. I ran out into the middle of the highway and screamed for everything I was worth.

Roger was running up to me, but I finally sobered up enough and just screamed: ""HE WAS CHASING ME AND HE TOOK MY WALLET AND HE WOULDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE!!!"" and blah blah blah, damsel in distress, tears, blah blah. All that mess.

My father was a paranoid ex-military. And my mother is an ex-Officer. I can honestly say I learned some trick of the trade in 'Don't Fuck With Me 101'

I have encountered PLENTY of weird situations and have came out unscathed in all of them.

Please add your tips as well! 

So the first layer of your personal bubble should be demeanor:

-----1.) HOODS! Hoods give off a creepy vibe, and should be decided upon the wearer. Whichever makes you feel unapproachable and safe. 

-----2.) Gaze. Look BEYOND where your headed. Seem as though you got somewhere to be and your fucking PISSED about it. 

-----3.) Look around a lot. Make it known that you are aware of your surroundings. But don't just merrily look around like ""OH! Such a beautiful night! Look at all the pretty trees and lights!"". Make it shady. Look over your shoulder with a furrowed brow and a slightly downward frown.

-----4.) Swagger. Walk with a steady foot. As if the front foot weighs a TON. Slam that foot down firm. Make it seem as though you are well rooted with your balance. Keep your back straight

-----5.) Make sure they cannot see your hands. Put them in your pockets

NO GODDAMN HEADPHONES!

All these may seem hard to do at once but you eventually just end up doing it by nature. Just like scaring off animals

If they happen to penetrate your space then you take these steps.

-----1.) Act equally insane. My friends make fun of me for this but it saved me before. I was being held up and he had no weapon. He came up behind me and wrapped his arm around my neck. The only thing I could think to do was yell in the deepest voice I could muster. [Like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRsjCWNXtRE). It does three things. It disorients the perp, quick.

-----2.) Self defense. Many people don't have proper training so heres a quick thing to do that takes absolutely NO SKILL. Take your thumbs and press them as hard as you can in the space between the ribs. It hurts.... BAD. It is also a good way to easily break the cartilage

-----3.) Carry a weapon. Find your state laws on legality and get the most menacing knife you can get within limits. But only follow this step if you 100% completely intend to use it. It can easily be used against you if you hesitate. They are there to harm you

The best way to protect yourself is to avoid completely. Sometimes it is inevitable but a lot of the time people just can't see their surroundings because they lack the skills of perception. Trust me if someone approaches you and you seem surprised it's because you aren't paying attention. They have been casing you for a while. So if a man comes up to you on the street

Ways to enhance perception. My dad taught me these.

- Sit with your back to a wall. Or anywhere that you can see the most people. 

-When you enter a room count Items on people like as soon as you walk in count how many people have hats or something, and be able to instantly count the number of people, where they sit, what they wear. It becomes almost instinct.

-When around numbers of people look at ALL of their eyes

-LISTEN! We go by everyday just hearing the sounds of people talk

- God this is going to sound stupid but it works. Blindness. Whenever your in a safe zone, so don't think you're gonna become spiderman or some shit. But I can FEEL cars pass on the road, people walk around, airplanes above(I live next to an airport so it's not hard to feel them anyway). There are time when this is useless. Not too often can you feel people on pavement, cars maybe, but people no. But indoors since floors vibrate easily, it works really well.

All these skills take time but eventually it's just like breathing

Because there are so many unmarked police cars in my area

Last week I was on my way home from a date in an area I was slightly unfamiliar with around midnight. I was driving along at the speed limit, I had never been pulled over, and I was driving past 11 (Not allowed for minors in my state) Not to mention I had a small amount of illegal herbs hidden under my spare tire in my trunk. So, knowing my towns extremely harsh police force, I was nervous. 

I pull off the road into an abandon out of business gas station, and I take notice that he's surprisingly good looking, in his early twenties, with longer-than-most-cops blond hair. He leans his head uncomfortably far into my small car, asks me where I'm headed, and if I know why I was pulled over. I answer, and I say ""No"" to the latter question. He smirks and says ""I do"", registration

He had a civilian license plate, but I remained in my car. He comes back to my car, and asks me to pull around behind the building of the closed gas station. I say ""Sure!""  and turn on my car, but inside alarm bells are ringing. There was no reason for me to go behind the building, other than to hide our cars from the road. I roll up my window and dial 911 as he walks back to his car. 

I tell the operator I was just pulled over by a suspicious police car, with him following, and I pull my car around the otherside of the building, and make a break for the road. He turns on his lights and follows. 

By this point I'm still on the line with 911, faster than I'd ever driven before, and my car begins shaking violently and the timing belt starts clicking and whirling. But I'm still going. The policeman keeps a steady trail behind me, lights, but not sirens, on. My poor car screams and screeches through a red light, and after the turn I realize I'm on the road that runs through my town, and I have my fingers on the horn (its a button) and I'm weaving through angry drivers at 60 on a 40 mph road.  My only hope is to attract the attention of a real police officer

I stop my car and look around desperately. I don't see anyone. I've never felt such a feeling of hopelessness in my life. I thought I was going to die. When I drove into that parking lot I expected to run into the arms of my hero, strangling my steering wheel. I only turned around when I heard a car door slam, and I was sure this was the end. I look at the mirror, expected the horrible short pants wearing fake policeman, but instead I see three, marked, real policecars, hands on guns

They brought me to the station, probably fearing there was a hiding policecar there. They praised me on my ""critical thinking"" and calling 911, and told me there had been a string of violent rapes, one ending in a girls death, in the neighboring state, all pulled over by a car matching my description. Far as a I know, they haven't caught him yet.

 It was around closing time, so she asks if he would like her to make him something, as she is closing the place down. He then begins to move around the counter to the opening of the counter to get closer to her. At this point she is completely freaked and running through her mind everything she could possibly use as a weapon. He's saying things like ""don't worry"" and ""I'm not gonna hurt you."" 
He then gets too close for comfort, who then booked it out of the cafe. The sandwich man was completely oblivious to the event he had just thwarted and why my friend was broken down in tears at his arrival. 
The next day the manager reviewed the camera footage and printed a photo of the creeper. She never closed alone again and her co-workers said that the guy had come by a few more times after that. He even asked after her once.

Spend last night alone in the house basically shitting myself

I phoned the police offices today and they sent a couple of officers around to check the house, the attic is empty and sealed up, no way in or out. So that's it. 

They are concerned that someone has keys to our house

The most likely conclusion is this: one of friends have been sneaking cigs, I don't know - maybe put it down to human anxiety? One thing gets creepy, the mind starts finding weird shit happening everywhere, and works itself up. I guess that the rather unsatisfying but better answer.

So that's it, you truly scared the shit out of us.

We're changing the locks - the chance it could be someone coming in at night and smoking our cigs is possible, and that's it.

1346080552.0,ywn0s,My work shift this past Saturday.,McBurger,426,90,47,"Hello

____

Forgive me in advance, and I've never posted here before (not too much spooky has happened to me prior to this).

Also, but I was panicked at the time.

I work part time for my university's IT department. I manage the public computer sites, etc. I'm mostly on call all the time, and during a Summer weekend there is not much to do except get paid.

The campus library is across the hall from my office. Normally it is open, doors locked. There's no way to get in unless you have swipe card access, which I do. There are computers in there.

So I'm in my office passing time on the Internet, tugging on the doors and trying to rip them open. He noticed me come out and asks (more like yells) to me: ""When does this place open?!""

I pointed to the hours sign and explained it would be open on Monday when classes begin. He walks away

More time passes, if I got caught I'd probably be in a small amount of trouble since I really didn't have permission or a reason for being in another department's area during closed hours.

All the lights are off except, or to have sex in them (yeah, gross). But the library has been closed for almost 24 hours at this point, and no one likely camped out in here; it's just noises.

Still as I walk alone in this place, and as I walk in I notice there's someone in the stall.

All I can see is one foot at first glance from underneath the door. One naked foot, *bloody* foot. There's a small pool of blood on the floor in the stall, and small trickles of blood on the foot.

I froze for a small moment and tightened up. I was startled first because I hadn't expected to find anyone else here. Second

I didn't see any sort of socks or shoes around, cold white foot. Large, too.

The stall door is partially open

I say with a shaken voice ""Hello?""

No response

I ask ""What the fuck are you doing

Then the toes slowly curl up

I promptly turned right out the door and walked out of the library quickly. Got back into my office as I tried to make sense of what I just saw. Should I call campus police? I really just didn't want to get involved with dealing with paperwork, I felt queasy.

Andy and I talk for a good 40 minutes, that's messed up"" and no startling discoveries. Heavily considered calling police but so much time had passed I assumed the person would be long gone. The bloody foot also certainly thought he was alone, so he would have been startled by my appearance too. 

I decide I'm going to go back, but I want to go check the bathroom again.

As I walk through the library

I softly walk to the bathroom and listen outside the door for a moment. I don't hear any sound

I go inside; foot is still there. There's more blood than before. Still cold and pale looking. The door is now shut to the stall; the only other change in the last 40 minutes.

I was *really* hoping not to see anyone in here this time. I do not want to anger a possibly suicidal person. 

I ask ""...Are you alright?""

No response. No motion. Only blood. It makes me feel sick.

I repeat

Slowly, with the wall between us. I can't see the top of any head.

My heart starts racing. Finally

That was good enough an answer for me. I promptly turn and leave; this time I run.

I had told myself before going in that if he was still there

The voice sounded like an older man

I lock the door to my office and do nothing for the last 30 minutes or so of my shift. When I step out into the hallway

I was horrified. I hurried to my truck. I paused for a moment and realized with the amount of blood outside my office door and in that hallway

I head back up

Whatever it is

I go back to my truck. There are bloody towels in my door handle

I hurry right over to the campus police. I'm just gonna tell them the whole story. Even the fact that I was also trespassing

We were second off the corner, and they had a couple of little girls, maybe 5 and 6. They were nice, but I was 12, so I was almost a woman, don't you know. Too sophisticated for children. Next house down from that was a group of four flats, with a bunch of guys in their early 20s living in them. All the fences were waist height, so you could talk from fence to fence

I liked that, in the way only 12 year olds can - where the other person probably isn't even aware you're flirting but only because you're so damn young. The guys liked me, kind of like a kid sister. They were always outside during the summer, and we got really close. One of the guys got married, moved out. The flat was empty for maybe 3 weeks before someone moved in, and I was keen to meet the new neighbours.

Turned out three guys had moved in, and he really gave me the skeevies, and the other guy... he was something else. He was in some sort of assisted living program, he had a 'helper' who he treated like a mother, he worked part time at a local appliance retailer, and he always had this dirty hat with an upturned brim on, even at night. 

One day while I was hanging the washing, ""Warren"", was staring at me. He climbs over the fence into next doors yard, crosses the yard up to my fence, goes to climb over it but I was backing away, and he stopped with his hands in the air, like a surrendering backing off gesture, I just want to talk"".

""I'm 12.""

""How old is your sister? she's pretty like you.""

""She's 13.""

""I bet she's not a virgin

At this point I'm feeling my way back across the edge of the garage so I can run into the house.

""Does she have a boyfriend? I'd like to be her boyfriend.""

He doesn't seem to realise I'm not responding

""She seems like someone who would let me be her boyfriend. I know you'd never let me be your boyfriend

He stepped over the fence at this point
He stepped a little closer to me with every word

""You'd never let me be with you

My dad was freaked out and wanted to kill the guy, by any account) never picked up his last paycheck, and turned out to be using a fake name.  The name he was using was Frank but he had told me his name was Warren, and apparently Frank didn't exist. It was all very confusing and in the end nothing came of it.

Amanda is my brother's girlfriend. At the time of this story

The listing was for a room in a house for about $225 a month, the listing only had a single photo from outside the property. Amanda sent an email wanting to meet the occupant and tour the house. Within 30 minutes, she receives an email back with all the details and time to stop by. The girl worked late hours and wanted Amanda to stop by at 8pm.

When Amanda arrives, it looks nice but slightly unkempt: tall grass, weeds, dusty windows, etc. Still no alarms for Amanda though. When she knocks on the backdoor and an older man opens the door. At first Amanda thinks she has the wrong house but the man reassures her and says that the occupant (I forget the name) was out and he was the landlord. The occupant asked him to meet Amanda since she was working late. He seemed pleasant and offered to show her around. 

Alarms start going off but aren't at red alert yet. First, and looked like he lived in his car. Also, only the kitchen light was on. As they walked around the house, Amanda noticed one huge red flag: No furniture. Nothing. The landlord was polite about answering questions but seemed irritable to keeping lights on for too long, rushing her around and only letting her look at rooms for a few moments. There was a single room that the landlord wouldn't open, telling her that it was the occupant's room and he didn't want to invade her privacy. As they walk down the hallway into the living room, she notices the front door has a plank nailed across it. ""Broken"" for sure.

Amanda's creep-o-meter is started to ding so she decides to wrap up the walk-through and leave but trying to polite. As she's giving the guy her ""thanks for the showing"" bit, it opens outward to create something of a barrier between Amanda and the backdoor. The basement is pitch black. He smiles, motions down the stairs, and says ""Ladies first.""

What happens next is nothing more than a stroke of luck. Amanda get a text just as some random person parks in front of the house. Thinking on her feet, you have to see it."" With a motion of confidence, she excuses herself around the landlord and walks out of the back door. She says the guy just looked at her like he was confused. Once outside, she sprinted to her car and sped like hell out of there. 

When Amanda got home, and went to investigate. The Craigslist post had been removed.

EPILOGUE 

The house had been foreclosed over six months earlier and the property had been abandoned. When the police investigated, and empty gallon jugs everywhere. More creepy was he had plastered ripped up pages from porno mags on ALL the walls in the room (where do they even find porno mags!?).

The really scary part of this was the basement. The man had tied a thin piece of fishing twine at about shin level across the stairs about halfway down. The basement was empty except another pile of old blankets, electric, etc). 

Amanda ended up not moving in.

1372638121.0,1he829,Anonymous Tip Line Not So Anonymous,TrebleTreble,385,60,24,"A few summers ago I was working as a front desk receptionist at a popular downtown salon. On slower evenings, one evening, which was several days later and on my day off. He scheduled the appointment under her name

When I returned to work I was playing around on the computer used for appointments and I suddenly remembered the appointment I had made for that man's ""girl."" I wondered if they had kept it. They had not

About three weeks later I am standing at the front desk and this same man walks in with a very young girl. At the time I guessed that she was about 15 and he was in his late 20s. I glanced down at name on the next appointment and it was not the same name the man had previously given me, he was checking her in for a color appointment. I suddenly went from judgment to full on suspicion, but this girl did not seem scared or uncomfortable at all. In fact, she seemed very sweet and a bit dreamy (think Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter series). And he was perfectly pleasant just as he'd been before. I checked the young girl in and alerted the stylist that her appointment had arrived. 

I knew the color was going to take a good 2.5 hours, but the body language and facial expressions indicated a confident man flirting with a young girl who was shy, but pleased with the attention she was receiving. Having once been a shy 16-year-old girl myself (I was 23 then) my red flags and alarm bells were marching in a parade all around me. When the stylist who was coloring the young girl's hair went to the back office, I followed.

""So
The stylist rolled her eyes and said
(Cue the the master of ceremonies because this parade of red flags just reached the zenith.)
""Yeah
The stylist shrugged and said
""What do you mean?""
""I don't know
air-headed

Okay
""Thank you
day.""
""Yeah

During this time I was working at the salon and at a restaurant in a city that was a 50 minute drive from my apartment. The drive was all freeway and I knew it well. The landscapes, it shocked me when I actually processed what it said: Report Human Trafficking.

And I knew that's exactly what that slimy motherfucker was doing with these young girls. I called the number and told my story. I expected bored derision from the woman at the other end. I was going on a gut feeling

(Alright, but you did the right thing today. Let's hope someone helps that poor girl. Oh, and don't forget to speak with your young, naive co-worker about that man.)

Two days later I'm back at the salon when three big men walk in. Alarm #1: their clothing was baggy and dirty, while the biggest one walks straight toward me. 

""Is Treble here today?""
""Why?""
""I need to speak with her.""
""She can't have visitors at work and I'm not able to give out her schedule.""
Deep sigh and then a badge hanging from a chain on his neck slips out from under his t-shirt
So-and-So with the Anytown Police Department and I need to speak with her now."" 
""I'm her

I proceed to tell and re-tell my story and answer a ton of questions. The officer also speaks with the stylist and my young co-worker. I gave him the phone numbers that the man left for each appointment he made (they were different) and then the three undercover officers left. It's over

But they're back the next day
I don't really know what I'm looking at except to say that it's an advertisement of some sort. It's two black and white pictures of a young girl in nothing but a thong and text that is covered by the officer's hand. Also, ""Well, what if she lost weight?""
""Yeah
Then Officer So-and-So and this new guy follow me back to the office and ask me a few more questions. I am able to ask the officer if they've located her and he tells me that they have. He goes so far as to tell me that other undercover officers are headed to a hotel sting at that very moment.  I said
The officer then asks me why I decided to call the tipline and I told him that the whole thing just didn't seem right. He made some joke about offering me a job because they needed more people who acted on instinct. So movie-like
He then said that as soon as the sting was over he was going to make sure I was given proper recognition. Joy turned to fear and I was suddenly deep into my first realization that some cops are idiots who can't be trusted and that I too am an idiot.
""What?! No
anonymous!"" 
""That's too bad because you deserve to be rewarded.""
""No,"" and another realization that this officer has my full name, phone number, and place of employment written down in his stupid little notebook.
""What happens to your notes?"" I asked him.
Officer Fuckface responds like this: ""Don't worry
What the fuck does that even mean?! This is not an episode of the god damn Sopranos (rip
Officer Jackass has to leave but Badge Man stays. Oh

What happens next is obvious. I get mono and I'm begging the gods above to let me die in my intermittent sleep. And then I get a phone call from the salon manager, there's two TV news crews here...and some newspaper reporters too. We're playing dumb, but maybe it's a good thing you got sick.""
""Do they know my name?"" I ask.
""No.""
I put in numerous calls to the officer and special agent and received no response. But I thought they were proud of me...? 
The officer had given me two numbers
The special agent returned my call some days later. Finally! He wanted a written statement.  
Go fuck yourself.
He couldn't understand why I was being so uncooperative. 
Go. Fuck. Yourself.
Finally he threatened me with a subpoena. 
You want to subpoena someone who called an anonymous tipline? Go fuck yourself. 
He called me a few more times but I didn't answer. Ultimately I had to drag my sick ass to my favorite professor's office because he also happened to be a badass attorney. I felt incredibly uncomfortable asking for his advice, ""An employee at a local business..."" 
Long story short, the man was arrested and charged with a number of things (including human trafficking), but he was released and I don't know what happened after that. I'm not scared anymore but I was looking over my shoulder that entire summer.

1370178022.0,1fim6l,Violin Hill,Nervacore,373,46,75,"*This is a cross post from /r/nosleep

So I'm new to Reddit and just discovered this sub


Around two years ago

All the roads around us had been partially completed and all the other properties were marked out, noone lived there.


To the left of my house roughly a few hundred meters away was a field with a huge hill in it. I later found out that the whole area was council property

The only other noticeable feature in the area was a small abandoned farm house with a shed a few kilometres down the road. I knew nothing about it and often went walking there with the dog as it gave me something mild to explore amongst the vast nothingness I was living around. The entire place was dilapidated and completely inhabitable


About a month or two after moving in, I peeked out the curtain and saw the house opposite mine was still as vacant as it ever was. I got dressed but by the time I managed to look outside, the violin has stopped. 

This happened roughly every second day for the next week, up on the hill, was a figure playing a violin. 

It was barely light, spinning slowly around in a circle as they played. I took my eyes off the person and walked over to pick up the morning paper and in the 10 seconds that took me, I heard the violin stop. 

When I looked up


After that morning, but I swore I could hear someone walking on the street next to my bedroom window in the early mornings, however I never saw anything. 

Other really general things as well, as the experience with the violin player had me a little shaken. 

One night as I was heading to bed, however it sounded more muffled and rehearsed. 

I froze and a cold chill flowed through me instantaneously. Considering that it was about midnight and not the usual time I'd hear it playing, I never saw any movement inside the house. 

I moved away from the window sufficiently freaked out and after another five minutes, I figured they'd just give me shit about it and I'd just become more agitated.


But nothing compared to what happened next. In my living area, I'd never need to cover this one with a sheet or blanket because noone could ever see in. I usually had headphones on when I played and I always had the lights off, for no other reason than I preferred to play games in the dark. 

One night when I was gaming, very faint lights. 

I didn't even catch on and immediately started walking back to the desk fixated on the small glowing balls and it wasn't until I had my nose almost pressed against the glass that I realised the two lights weren't lights at all. 

They were eyes. 

A set of eyes, either my head kicked into gear or my muscles loosened but my body automatically collapsed and I fell to the floor, scurrying to hide against the wall away from the window. 

I could hear my heart beating through the carpet like a drum as I tried to lay as flat as possible and as my mind was still processing the sheer severity of the situation

The lights were still off and I wanted to get up to turn off the PC screen so I couldn't be seen, notes been missed frequently and the strings screeching. The pace of it was getting faster and faster and by this time, my dog Jeb out in the backyard had picked up on the situation and registering an unfamiliar sound, gave one solitary, deep bark. 

The violin instantly stopped and the house was finally dead silent excluding my headphones which I could hear quietly working away. I was still frozen to the carpet and it wasn't until Jeb gave a second menacing bark that I heard the figure outside the window start to walk away in the direction of my yard. 


Once that first footstep hit the ground, staring into the backyard. I ducked to keep low and quietly unlocked and slid open the door. 

Usually doing so would notify Jeb that he was allowed inside but when the door opened up, put my hand under his collar and attempted to back him toward the house. Jeb is a pure labrador and weighs like a sack of sand so when he doesn't want to move, it takes a sheer force to pull him in the direction you want him to go and right now, Jeb wasn't going anywhere. 

I yanked at his scruff and as I did, bellowing ""fuck you right off"" sound that elevated my nerves to an all time high. We both just stood there, waiting for some form of reply and I couldn't remember how long we both just froze there, but eventually i heard footsteps from around the side of the house begin to walk away. But not a simple walk, almost like whoever was doing it was slowly dancing in a circle, the footsteps keeping to a beat as they drifted away from the house into the distance. 

Once I couldn't hear anything, locked the door behind me and spent the night reverting to my child-like self; hiding under my bed covers with my dog. I didn't sleep a wink.


That was the last time I ever saw or heard the violin player. The following morning when the sun finally came up, he would have had to be over 6ft to stare over that fence at me but they explained that he could have been standing on something, or on his toes. 

They also told me that they've never received a report of anyone playing a violin in the area or anyone been in the fenced off hill either. I essentially looked like an insane person


Over the next year or two, but could never find it. There were a few classical pieces that seemed reminiscent, but I've since thought that whatever tune was played must have been self composed, which creeps me out even more.

One day

After leaving, knocking them both off the road.

She was pissed off and exited her vehicle. The person who exited the other car was the man who had been following her. He approached her, I don't got insurance,"" before swinging a left hook at full strength, hitting her in the face with so much force that she immediately passed out. 

When Emily came to, but it was almost 5 in the morning and few people were about. This was occurring in front of houses, however, and someone did look out their window to see it occurring. They called the police.

By the time the police got to the scene, with the door open and pizza on the seat. The man, with Emily, was nowhere to be found. 

As it turns out, Emily petrified with horror and dreading what she was almost certain would be her imminent death. 

Once they got to Emily's house, but by this point they were heading to the kidnapper's home in another town.

It was at this point that Emily remembered something that her mother told her: in the case of a kidnapping, force yourself to vomit. The attacker will most likely stop what he or she is doing to avoid it, and give you a chance to escape.

Emily started trying to vomit, ""If you puke in this car I'm going to kill you. Do it out the window."" 

She leaned out of the open window to puke, banging doors and screaming for help. There were no answers. Eventually, as she was being chased by the attacker, she came to an undercover FBI agent's home. His wife answered the door and immediately grabbed Emily by her pant-waist and threw into the house. The agent ran out of the house with his gun, where he met the attacker and arrested him. 

Emily ended up okay

A couple weeks later, ""I'm an FBI agent. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the incident with your daughter."" Emily's mother asked for her badge, upon which the woman got a look like a deer in the headlights and sprinted away from the house.

I was really into drawing at the time and my parents were always pretty good about letting me explore my talents and interests as long as I gave a good try and didn't just get bored after a couple of times.  

So I started taking lessons with this woman that was a friend of a family friend.  The actual lessons weren't that weird and I didn't get much of a creepy vibe from her myself.  I thought it was weird that her name was the same as my mother's but spelled differently but that wasn't really something that she had control over.  For several months I went to her house and had my lessons or worked on a painting.  If I had an assignment for art class we would work on that.  

One day I was picked up from school by my mother instead of riding the bus to daycare.  At the time

For a couple of hours after I got home I just sat and waited on my dad.  I had the very real fear that I was in trouble.  My mother usually disciplined me but if I did something REALLY bad it always got turned over to my dad.  Finally he walked in and I got my most somber expression ready.  He sat down and told me that I would not be going to art lessons anymore.  I was heartbroken and he hesitated before explaining.  

Evidently

She then called my dad's workplace and told him that she had me with her and that my mother was ""dealt with"".  She wouldn't tell him what she did but kept telling him that she loved him and we could be a wonderful family.  He stayed on the phone with her for awhile before telling her that she was right and he would be over after work to talk about everything.  Thankfully that teacher at my school thought it was odd and called my emergency contact numbers and the secretary at my dad's work gave him the message.  Now that he knew I was safe

Everything ended up ok in the end.  She got the help she needed and as far as I know she's fine now.  She paints murals for businesses in the area.  I didn't even directly experience the creepiness but I do get a little weirded out when I see any of the work she's done.

I am a complete nerd and to prove this

At first

Fast forward.

Nick, another couple, and I all went out to a Puerto Rican club one night. I was very attached to my sexy Zune at the time and brought it with me everywhere. Well, me being the lush I am, I had drank a decent amount that night and gotten a ride back to my house from Nick. I ended up drunkenly leaving my Zune in his car. When I noticed it was missing, I called him up and asked him to return it. He came to my house to drop it off and stupidly told me he had come across a topless photo I took. Me + whiskey + camera = topless picture. At least at that time. But I digress. He told me he came across this picture while checking out my Zune ""to see if I wanted to buy one"" (his words). I tried to find the picture he was referring to. It turns out you had to scroll down to the 13th gallery and then scroll down to the last picture. Obviously he was scoping out my pictures.

I felt violated. I decided to ignore him because I was pissed that he invaded my privacy in a way. A week later, and black that night and she was helping me. Around 10pm that night, Nick calls. I ignore the call. Then he called again. And again. Up until the point where he would call, I wouldn't pick up, and then he would call immediately after. I was flying out to Florida to see my biological family the next morning from an airport about 2-3 hours away. I decided to pick up the phone and fake being asleep. I tried to convince him I was asleep and I had a flight early tomorrow, which was bending the truth a bit. My flight wasn't THAT early in the morning. After I hung up the phone, he called back. Danyell had had enough. She picked up the phone (It was my cell phone, we looked at each other and decided to go outside and have a cigarette.

So we go outside my house and talk about Nick and how convoluted it was that he wouldn't leave me alone. I live on a cul-de-sac and my parents' house is near the end of it. My back is to the street and Danyell is facing me. Mid sentence

I turn around to look at the street and I see someone walking towards us down the street. It's Nick. I decide to meet him at the bottom of my driveway. He basically says it's bullcrap that I've been ignoring him and we need to discuss ""our problems"" by this time, then I feel an arm around my neck and something pressed against my temple. At this point, I think I should be scared so I force myself to cry for effect. As I'm being pulled up the street, I realize there's a gun to my head. THAT'S when I really start to cry.

Meanwhile

Now at this point

My dad comes out and says something to Nick about letting me go or something. Around this time, all the while yelling at me to come back to the house where it's safer. I can't move. I'm literally frozen, crying and screaming hysterically. I finally find it in me to move, so I crawl to the sidewalk. Then a little while later, I get an adrenaline rush and run to my house. There's a big pile of dirt at the edge of my front yard where a fence used to be and of course I don't see it and I trip over it. By now, Danyell has come back outside and is hiding behind her car. I happen to fall near her and she drags me behind her car with her. I'm still crying and I can hear my dad scream ""No Nick, don't do that!"" I bust out crying harder then before. Then, 5 cop cars come barrelling down my quite

The cops then secure the scene. Danyell, I realize we're right next to Nick's car. I point it out to him.

In his car, rope, a knife, and binoculars. Nick told the cops flat out what his plans were that night. Apparently, he was going to kidnap us, bind and gag us, rape Danyell and ditch her

Sorry for the length. I felt the need to go in to detail.

My grandma is a very selfless person, and I. She didn't have very much money at all, as she wasn't able to get a job due to extensive knee injuries she received in a car accident years before this. Her boyfriend Louie, however, SEEMED to be the breadwinner. He kept the bills paid, and he came and went as he pleased. He wasn't the friendliest of people, and boy was he lazy/sloppy. He always gave me a weird vibe.

In this 3 bedroom house lived: My mother, my two aunts, and my brother and I. It was a full house, so to say. My brother and I shared a pull out couch in the living room, while my mom slept on a couch adjacent to us. Our move into the house occurred during summer vacation, so me and my brother always looked for something to do. On occasion Louie would take my brother to the nature trails by our house, and they'd go fishing. He had recently been laid off from his job, asleep

One day I was using the bathroom and I dropped the toilet paper roll off the ring. I bent down to pick it up and noticed a stash of books against the cupboard. I reached and grabbed out more than a dozen pornography books. Quite obviously they were Louie’s. I panicked and I told my mom what I had found, he became very violent towards everyone; especially my mother and her two sisters. 

On top of this,) but she did suspect Louie. She already didn't like him due to his laziness, his nasty porn stash, and his growing attitude towards everyone in the house. She banned him from taking my brother on their fishing trips, and also began encouraging my grandma to break up with him. 

My grandma still decided to keep him around even though he started becoming very violent towards her as well. This all changed when my mom saw her powersaw in the window of a pawn shop. It had the same exact serial number that she had on the warranty papers. She asked the pawn shop who had sold the saw

That was the final straw. My mom took charge and moved his things out. He became belligerent once again

What we found out next still sends shivers down my spine. Louie was a recovering cocaine addict who had relapsed--and badly. He failed a drug test
He moved to a tiny apartment complex soon after

Months went by and we all forgot about what had happened--until my grandma and my mom saw something on the news that stopped their hearts for a moment. A NY man was arrested for the murder of a Florida woman. The mugshot appeared on screen. It was Louie. Not only was he a drug addict
Apparently he met the woman right after everything went down with my grandma

When the woman went missing, but she felt terrible that he was “laid off” and had moved all the way to Florida with her, so she refused.

Finally Louie snapped, and stashed them in the trunk of her OWN car. He drove said car--with her body inside--to a storage garage in Wisconsin, and left it there for several months before it was finally discovered. When this woman went missing, the family pointed fingers at Louie, and a search went out for him. He was finally tracked down in Wisconsin, and arrested. He was proven guilty of second degree murder, and other charges such as grand theft auto. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison


I just can't imagine what would have happened if my mom hadn't been so adamant about my grandma kicking him out. He was truly crazy.  My mom, or I easily could have been in the place of that poor woman. Or even my poor brother! I later learned that on those “fishing trips,” he would get high on coke, and drive with my little brother around whilst being so. Easily the creepiest thing that I've been through.

Years ago, so it seems as if we had a very concentrated amount of crazy people. I was really naive, and did not know how to say no to people, so I got into a lot of perplexing situations there.

For our uniforms we had to wear white button-up blouses, but our last names as well. My first name is slightly unique, but my last name is uncommon. Basically, i'm really easy to find. You search my name in Google or Facebook, and I am the only one (as of now) that pops up. I was always really uncomfortable with people seeing my full name in such a public job.

An older man with big glasses, but I wasn't quite catching on that he was getting creepy. I was a senior, and shared that with him. He asked me a few more things and he was on his merry way.
I promptly forgot about him. He came back in one week later, not in front of one. He had a nervous laugh and disappeared. About 15 minutes later, a coworker ran up to me and asked me if I just saw this old guy in a red plaid coat take a picture of me from behind this glass window we had by the entrance. It was really creepy, but I let it go.

About 2 weeks after this, but I worked two jobs and I valued my few nights a week that I had off and would rather spend them with family. In trying to convince me, he told me that he had a community of people that lived on his land, and they were all very peaceful. I turned him down again and moved to a customer waiting for me.

Later on that week Emmanuel Lamb Branch came back in with some flyers (apparently he had been going door-to-door) and handed them to me, it was informing people of the New Kingdom, and how Emmanuel Lamb Branch was the leader of the New Kingdom, and that he had a bride waiting for him. His bride was ME. He put my full stinkin' name in there and explained how he'd commissioned a local artist to paint a large portrait portraying me as his bride. Apparently it was sitting above his fireplace. He said that we were to have descendants who would rule the New Kingdom.

That was it. I'd had enough of him. I went home crying and asked my mom what to do. She immediately called the police and they issued a restraining order on him. They took all of my papers from him and talked to him. He told them that I wanted to be his bride

Well

About 3 or so minutes into my cig, I notice that I can hear tires gripping the road as well.

We hope this has forced him to give up, but instead, he stands outside the store, waiting for us. Eventually, a salesperson there asks us if we need anything and we tell her about the man outside.

She goes out, even though I'm pretty sure he is actually gone this time.

My dad is 6'6 and 230 pounds of pure muscle (he was an athlete) so he's in incredible shape and just a very imposing man. He takes his shirt off and puts on this mask that my uncle just so happened to have laying around. This mask was human faced

He goes to the shed and takes the ax and decides he's going to scare these drunk assholes.

The property that they were on is shaped like a square with dense forest completely covering the outskirts. Their fire was right in the middle. My dad slowly walks from the forest, swinging the ax and staring at the fire.

1375620338.0,1joepx,ALWAYS change your locks.,AnErinWithAnE,358,43,58,"OK. So I'm new to this subreddit but I definitely have a story that belongs here. The year was 2010, a fresh start after an emotionally crippling time in my life.

It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon, which in this complex took up half the living room wall, floor to near ceiling. I had blinds, but had decided to adjust them so some natural light would come in.

Now, and you always lock your house and your car. I had seen my share of shady activity, so regardless of the time of day, my doors and windows were locked. It had also come to my attention that my ex had done drive-by's of my new place, and not wanting to be caught off-guard, I was constantly checking that I had locked everything.

A beat up car pulled into the parking lot, but I didn't recognize the driver who stepped out.

Until he walked in front of my window

The bushes in front of my windows were maybe waist-high on me (I'm 5'4""), and there was no mistake --  he saw I was inside, by myself. 

From what I saw between the blinds, with dark eyebrows and a goatee. He wore a short-sleeve button up shirt over a dark t-shirt and jeans. I had never seen him in our complex before.

Kingsley's head shot up, playful dog, and loved meeting everyone. But when I felt a low grumble from his stomach when he bolted up off the couch, I knew this wasn't a stranger he wanted to meet.

My heart raced and I felt my palms tingle with anxiety. My cellphone was in my pocket, his paws nervously twitching. The door was locked, no way he could get in, right? 

...WRONG.

When I heard a key in the lock, of all fucking things, did he have a key to my apartment??

I didn't have a gun. The front door was 6 feet to my left, and I doubt throwing my nearby shoes would deter a home intruder of his size.

The door cracked open.

I panicked.

Kingsley let out the loudest bark I had ever heard and in one leap was snarling at the door, I saw the man's eyes widen and he shut the door.

*AND HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR*. I shit you not

Kingsley was busy, not acting at all like the giant goofball I knew him to be. I jumped up after him, grabbed his collar, and with the other hand grabbed the doorknob and opened it just enough for Kingsley to poke his head out.

""Can I help you with something?"" My voice shook. Anger and fear coursed through my veins.

""I'm here to pick up my mail. I'm expecting a package. I used to live here, as if this was something I should have known. What the fuck? 

""You don't live here anymore. I LIVE HERE. I don't have your mail"" Seriously?? Our mailboxes were at the apartment main office.

""I was EXPECTING a package from FedEx. I WANT my package."" He took a half step forward, expecting somehow that I would have his mysterious mail and invite him in? NOPE.

Actually, but as the name on it wasn't mine, I told the delivery guy and never accepted it. Still, did he really expect me to believe that the FedEx guy left him a package *in* an apartment he no longer resided in?

""They came by with something a few days ago. But it wasn't mine

His face went red and his fists clenched.

PANIC PANIC PANIC

""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?? THAT IS MY PACKAGE AND I WAS EXPECTING IT!!!"" He exploded, nearly dragging me out of the door. I yanked him back. The man continued his rant.

""I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING SO FUCKING STUPID! NOW I HAVE TO GO TRACK IT DOWN MYSELF! DO YOU KNOW WHAT A WASTE OF TIME THIS IS??""

I was frantic at this point, WHY, when he saw me in the living room with a dog, he tried to come in, and WHY of all things was he freaking out over a stupid envelope.

""LOOK man

""I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS SHIT!!!"" He was completely red

""YOU GOTTA LEAVE!"" I yelped

For a split second

""I'll be back."" He gulped, locking it, unlocking, then locking it again.

This afternoon, listening to my iPod, when I heard loud yelling. Loud enough for me to hear over the music. I turned and saw two people walking down an interstate off-ramp. That was weird. Then I realized the person in front, a woman, was running, and the man was chasing her. They yelled and struggled a little bit, but I couldn’t really see what was going on because I was too far away and a street sign partially blocked my view. 


I noticed that when the light changed, and a small tan sedan with its hazard lights flashing. The sedan was parked behind the SUV. The guy grabbed the woman and pulled her into the backseat of the SUV and they continued down the ramp. At the end of the ramp, at the traffic light, the SUV continued north, passing me at the bus stop. The sedan, which may have just been someone trying to help for all I know, turned right


As the SUV passed me, and the guy who had grabbed her. The guy who grabbed her was sitting with her in the backseat, her in the middle and him closest to me, against the door. They quickly pulled into the driveway of the gas station I was standing in front of, but didn’t stop. They went down to the next entrance and I figured they would head back the way they’d come, back to the interstate, but they didn’t. Instead, further north down the road. The road curved


I didn’t know what to do, a cop car pulled into the gas station (they’re right down the block – the SUV actually drove past the police department). At first, I think they thought I was the girl (both of us had dark hair, wearing a white shirt), but I told them what I’d seen. Then I watched as several more patrol cars showed up and cops started filling the parking lot. Then the bus came, so I left, but when I got home


As of yet


Here’s a link to map showing the approximate location of myself, where I stood. The red circle is where the woman and man struggled. The brown line is the path the tan SUV took once the woman was inside, and the green line at the bottom is the path the sedan took when the light changed. Like I said, I don’t know if the sedan was really involved. I’m thinking it might be a good Samaritan who stopped when they saw what was going on, and they likely were the ones to report the incident first.

I met Emily via my freshman orientation group. We were both theatre majors, got on quite well. She was maternal and gentle and sweet, always going out of her way to make sure everyone was doing all right and felt included. We spent the first few weeks of that year hanging out in my dorm room, watching cartoons and youtube videos and talking. We had a ton of common interests, and I was really happy that I'd met her.

However, so I got to be close with Beth as well. Beth would confide in me about the weird and upsetting things Emily did: she would randomly start sobbing and scream at Beth when she asked if she was okay, belittle Beth in front of other people... One week, we had two fire drills in a row because a girl in our hall's hair straightener set off the alarm. Emily started loudly screaming about how this girl's straightener should be taken away from her and how she as an awful, conceited bitch--right outside of said girl's door. Beth told her to Emily to calm down, and this offended Emily so much that when Beth got back from class that afternoon, Emily had constructed a cardboard partition between her half of the room and Beth's.

This behavior culminated with me and my freshman year roommate standing outside of Emily's door one night

After that suicide attempt though, Beth, and my freshman year roommate, Kitty, decided to all live together in a suite the next year since we got along so well. Sophomore year went quite smoothly.

Junior year--this year--the four of us were going to live in a house together. However, but what could we do? We got another roommate, Roxi, who was going to share a room with Emily, since the house only had three bedrooms and Beth and I had claimed the singles.

Emily started causing problems as soon as we'd all moved in. She was ridiculously anal about cleaning, and she said, ""Oh, I thought they were mine and had gone bad!"" She then proceeded to give me an absurd amount of money to replace the groceries, far more than I would need. She constructed a thirty-item chore chart for us, telling us to do everything on it, every day. 

This behavior, Beth, and I to the point of insanity. We confronted her about it, which culminated in a big fit of angry screaming and tears on her part. She got in my face and screamed at me for an hour, but eventually we decided that we would try hard to keep the house cleaner for her, and she would be less threatening and abrasive all the time.

We had about a week of happy, but she said she would be back at 11:00 and we could watch a movie together. I was charge artist for a play at the time, so I had a ton of painting to do. I spent the rest of the day painting, and was still working in the theatre at four in the morning, when Beth, haggard and clad in pajamas, showed up. Worried, and she simply said that I needed to come home right now. ""Something was up with Emily.""

As we walked back to the house, yelling variants of, ""I want to kill myself! I want to die! Someone kill me!"" Butt naked, Emily got on her bed, still screaming and crying about wanting to die, and began spanking herself. The spanking went on for about fifteen minutes--while Roxi laid there in the dark, horrified--until Emily collapsed, and she passed the fuck out

Roxi gathered up her blanket and pillow, turning the lights on and off, calling her name--but she was totally unconscious. They were worried, and that's why they came to get me. I was worried too, given Emily's history of suicide attempts, and the fact that she said she'd be home at 11:00 to hang out but instead stumbled home at 3:50. When they went downstairs, they saw that Emily had pulled up the Game of Thrones DVD menu screen to the words ""Winter is coming, as goofy as it sounds

I tried to rouse Emily when Beth and I got back to the house, just to get things checked out. We were afraid Emily had tried to overdose, or she had mixed something else with alcohol and reacted badly to it (she got crossfaded once and spent the night throwing up all over herself). We tried to dress Emily before the paramedics arrived, but gave up due to her being dead weight--however, in the process of trying to sit her up so we could get some clothes on her, we noticed that her ass was covered in oozing red welts from how hard she had been spanking herself.

She woke up while the paramedics were examining her and drunkenly explained to them that while she had a history of depression, but she was just hammered and needed some time to sober up. They offered to take her to the mental hospital to be on suicide watch for the night, but we said we could watch her. We were just so relieved she was only drunk. Another decision we would come to regret, as it were.

We were sitting in the living room after the medics left

She proceeded to scream at us for two hours while we tried to explain our rationale. Roxi explained to Emily how she had been spanking herself and screaming that she wanted to kill herself.
""I do want to kill myself!"" Emily replied. ""There isn't a second of the day that goes by that I don't want to die."" Roxi and I

In response to this, both arms wrapped around the joint of my knee, squeezing so hard, it bruised). Digging her fingers into my flesh, she delivered a rehearsed-sounding monologue about how, over the summer, she had stood by the highway,"" she concluded

She started trying to provoke all of us into anger, afraid I'd react violently if I stayed down there any longer.

Emily came into my room about an hour later. When I went up to her, around my face, breath reeking of vodka. She squeezed the flesh on the nape of my neck, digging her fingernails into me, and began telling me how she had resented me ever since freshman year. She hated that I was pretty and likable and talented and that I wasn't constantly miserable like her. She hated me since the day she met me. Just pouring abuse on me while she continued to hold me and kiss me against my will. I managed to push her away, and she told me she was going to move out--which I said was a good idea.

After that, where, despite my being upstairs, in my room, with the door closed, I could hear her simultaneously sobbing and cackling. It was a ragged, pained crying, so loudly I could hear it like it was happening right outside my door. Though I couldn't hear this, still covered in her blood

Roxi, and in the meantime, we went to the police, got a restraining order against her, and spent a few days living in ""protective housing"" in an unfurnished basement. We're back in the house now, sans Emily, and we have the locks changed. We haven't interacted with her since, she did try to run Roxi over at a crosswalk, well

I post on an alt because I don't want to be recognized. The reasons for this are multiple and will become apparent as you read my advice.  

Throughout my life my family and myself have been target of kidnapping and such crimes due to the nature of my parent's work. My father is high up in the corporate ladder, which I am not at liberty to discuss.  

**Because of all these factors, but it needed to become habit in my case.**  

As a family, attempted muggings to one. A grand total of about 6 attempted (failed) abductions summing up all attempts on all family members.  

Now that's out of the way
  
* **Don't be a target.** Do not draw attention to yourself in public in any way, muggers and pick pockets love people that are glued to their ipods, kidnappers love the guys who will stay a minute more in their car to listen to music/read/make out or whatever. Wait until you're in your house.  
**I can't stress it enough
If you're relatively wealthy and know you might be a target to crime, of course).  
Keep your conversations with friends in public transportation discrete, addresses and exact places you'll be.  

* **Avoid bad situations.** This is pretty obvious, avoiding paying for parking is not worth your safety.  
When on foot, go in reverse or go against street flow (this has the added bonus of confirming when a car is following you).  
A technique not many people know to avoid being intercepted in a car is to hunt for the green light

* **Don't trust anyone.** If you're being pulled over by cops, don't get off your car in isolated areas (most of the time they'll just follow you to where you are comfortable disboarding).  
If you see someone hurt on the road/broken down car/something and want to help. Don't stop your car or think about getting out of your car. Keep driving and call the police. If you jmust, guy got up and fled as soon as he noticed I wasn't going to stop, I floored the car after that). This really ties into this piece of advise: Don't get off your car or even stop your car unless absolutely necessary.  
When in a party or bar, food and drink at all times.  
The above paragraph is a date rapist's worst nightmare.  
If you think or know you're being followed, going into a crowded coffee shop and calling someone is one of your best options. Tell the business workers about your situations and describe the person that is following you, they will call the relevant authorities if you don't have a cell phone.  

* **Be aware.** This really goes without saying, if one of them is unaccounted for, look for them, they might just be in a bind.   
This last method is the a good way to guard your female friends against would be date rapists. During high school, she could have easily been the target and the group was lucky to have someone that aware with them.  

* **Worst comes to worst, you can really help the situation by remaining calm. Only speak when being spoken to, make them believe they are in control.   
**Abduction specific advice: do not even try to look into your abductor's faces
In case of the threat of rape or bodily harm, this can force a rapist to flee.  
If bodily harm is a high possibility, this is where self defense training and self defense devices such as tasers/pepper spray/weapons come in (note how last resort these options are). When considering this scenario, always remember odds are you will lose the fight unless you have REAL defense training with EXTENSIVE application, always aim to flee. Here's the reality check, a violent assailant has the huge advantage of experience, unless you have experience ACTUALLY FENDING FOR YOUR LIFE AND HARMING ANOTHER HUMAN / POSSIBLY KILLING HIM odds are YOU WILL LOSE THIS FIGHT. Making it clear, FLEE, FLEE.  Put your ego away.    

I'm saying it again:

To start with, the neighbors said no fire had occurred and the local fire department or police had never responded to a fire.

[Some photos of said property](http://imgur.com/a/MRJ8Y)

I had my fair share of problems with broken windows, one afternoon, I pulled up in front of the house and started my inspection as I usually did, by walking around the house and going into the garage. 

Immediately, you had to go in through a single door on the left hand side of the property, towards the back. I should also mention that the heating system of this house is such that all of the heat comes up from the middle of the house, through a big open vent covered with a screen. The duct work is gone so when you look through the vent, you can see into the crawl space.

I go in the garage and I notice that the crawl space door is open. I look up and notice that one of the bedroom windows is open. I stop. They should both be closed. 

I stand there for what feels like FOREVER and contemplate calling the police but I'm in a hurry so I just turn around

I start my inspection as I usually do: kitchen, bedroom #3, bedroom #1 and then I go to open the hallway closet in between bedroom #1 and bedroom #2. It won't open. I know I've opened it before. I'm turning the knob and pulling it and it will not open. I start to get a really weird feeling in my stomach. The car outside is still honking. 

I step over the vent in the floor to go to bedroom #2 and I look down to see a pair of eyes looking back up at me. I look up, into my car and locked my doors. The car stopped honking. 

This is what I think happened. When I got to the house

I returned to the property 2 weeks later to find the windows shut, the door opened with ease. I'm convinced someone was in the house with me on many of my visits, I just didn't know it.

I keep walking, walk past the girl, a pretty one at that, probably about my age, Hell if I wasn't in a happily committed relationship and not so concerned about freaking her out I'd have made a move of some kind. We both continue or journey going opposing routes.

I walk past the stationary shady guy

The shady guy is now trailing the girl

""Oh fuck it"" I thought to myself, this guy was up for some serious shit. I think the girl was now aware that the two people she just passed were now on her tail. I had to do something as well because we were getting to the most secluded part of the walk, if there was a time to make a move on a defenceless person that would be it. 

The problem is, and warn her. That however would mean running past the creeper, and creeping her the hell out in the process, I could distract the creeper....Which would probably result in my grizzly death (So much for not judging). I eventually, went for the classic 'Fuck it' tactic.


""HEY SWEET HEART! FANCY A GOOD TIME???!!"" 

My logic was, and ward off Mr.Shady pants.

1372544750.0,1hc0ad,The Pervert Next Door,darthpickles,354,47,39,"I've been meaning to post this story for awhile

My family moved to a semi-posh, my parents made friends with our next door neighbors, James and Margaret. They were only slightly younger than my parents (I'd guess mid-thirties) and had no children. When asked why they hadn't had any children yet, James said something along the lines of ""I'm waiting to get my ducks in a row."" 

They were super nice, and cable (which we did not have). At first, I really enjoyed hanging out with James. I thought he was funny and really easy to talk to. He spoke to me like he would to an adult, like we were friends. I could talk to him about school or vent about how strict my parents were. 

For months things were totally normal. Then, and sometimes he would hug me for too long. At first, I just ignored it, and assumed I was probably being paranoid. We continued to be friends with James and Margaret. We'd have dinner with them. Sometimes Margaret would invite me over to bake with her. 

One night, REALLY conservative.) I went to put it on my bellybutton, and he said ""it would be even funnier if you put it on your nipple instead, do you think it would fit?"" and he tried to lift my shirt up. That was when I knew I wasn't paranoid, and that this man was not my friend. 

Clearly, and for some reason felt like I'd just make everyone mad at me if I said anything. So, from that point on, I just made up any excuse to not be around James. If he and Margaret came to our house, I'd stay in my room the whole time. If my family went to their house, I'd say I had homework or just wanted to stay home by myself. My parents just figured I was being a typical anti-social teenager. 

For awhile, but then would try to casually strike up a conversation with me. I'd just brush him off and tell him I'd let my parents know he called. One night I was home alone and he called. He said he was bored, and asked if I wanted to come over and watch a movie. I said I had homework. Another night, he called and asked if he could swing by and pick up some movies that he had let my parents borrow. I felt like I didn't have a valid excuse for why he couldn't take back his own movies so I said ok. He said he'd come get them in a few minutes. I very quickly grabbed the movies, put them on my front porch, then went back inside and locked the doors. He rang the bell but I ignored him. He must have said something to my mom about it because she asked me why I didn't just give them to him, why didn't I answer the door? I told her my music must have been too loud and I didn't hear it. I came up with excuse after excuse and still said nothing

One night, on the second floor. I was just listening to some music, and cleaning near the window. I glanced up and there was James, standing in front of his kitchen sliding glass door, staring up at me. He was fully naked and masturbating. At the time, young and uninformed me didn't actually even know what masturbating was. All I knew was that James was definitely naked, and definitely watching me

A few nights later, I actually kept that shade duct taped shut so no one would make the mistake of leaving it up. 

That was the last thing that ever happened. I still didn't say anything, they didn't call. My parents would occasionally talk and wonder what happened. They couldn't understand why James and Margaret would just stop being friends with them. Still, I said nothing. Looking back, I think James probably panicked when he realized that both me AND my friend had seen him, that it would be two people's word against his. 

Over the years, our cats were coming into their yard, etc.) One night over dinner my mom was venting about it and said ""I don't understand what happened! They were our friends, and now they basically hate us! What could we have possibly done to offend them so badly?"" I couldn't take it anymore. I just blurted it out. ""James was a pervert and was harassing me."" I told them every single things that happened, and it all just fell into place and they understood and totally believed me. Obviously, they were livid and my dad wanted to march over to their house immediately and confront James. However, over five years had passed. I was an adult at this point, I had no proof.

 I was about 5 or 6 years old and I was shopping at a grocery store (Well-Spring) with my mom. Anyways, almost whisper. The guy then started to say I am so cute that he could kiss me and then tried to. He leaned down but I got closer to the ground as his lips were getting closer. This was in front of my mother. My mom just laughed and said she is shy so he stopped. Then he laughed and said goodbye. 
My mom told me to never let anyone do that unless I knew them extremely well to kiss me. After a few minutes we were about eat and said to go get some forks and knifes while she gets a seat. 
So I did and there was the man. He followed us around waiting for me to be alone. Then he grabbed me
At this point we are a few feet from the exit. If he got me out of the door, yelling and screaming. The man let go me and ran, with the fork still in his arm. 
My mom hugged me and never let go of me again until we got home and then she cuddled me for hours. She was crying and saying how much she loved me. Then
Years later I asked her what happened after that. She said Well-spring called the police and they found him and I that I was completely in the right to stab him

Me and Maggie had an incredible bond with each other, she absolutely loved people and would walk up to anyone to get petted. She was a sucker for attention, but for the most part was incredibly laid back.
   Once she reached the age of 10 she started slowing down a lot
However that day as we were walking an older man walked out from the woods next to the junkyard and started talking to me.
   
   I was on one side of the road
     As he started to talk to me he slowly started moving closer to me. Maggie stared him down the entire time and never took her eyes off him
Kept moving closer and looks at me and says ""So you said she has arthritis right?"" To which I responded ""yea but it only acts up on cold days in winter."" He then tried to pet her and she absolutely exploded. Mind you this dog could barely walk and here she was trying with all her might to attack him. Barking at the top of lungs
   It was then he changed his tune and started to show his colors. He asked me if I had a man to which I said yes

Unfortunately for me I went away from my house and the only way to get back was to turn around or walk around the entire prison which takes about 40 min and Maggie just wasn't up for it. We started back towards the house and the guy was just standing on the side of the road watching me. He starts trying to talk to me again and at this point I was like yea yea whatever and started walking to my house slowly

A couple of weeks passed and while that shook me up I blew it off thinking it was done and over with. That was until I saw the guy again one day. I was standing in the front of my house and saw a person driving their truck slowly through the alleyway. He made eye contact with me and didn't break it until he was past the fence where he couldn't see me anymore.
   Then later that week around midnight Maggie was acting up like she wanted to go out, he jumped the fence and was gone. 
    Not even a week later my sister walked into my room one night and sees a man trying to climb through my window, got out the window, and ran. 
   We called the cops and they started patrolling our house several times a night. We haven't seen a man in our backyard and I haven't seen that particular man since then. Maggie passed away last January. She was an amazing dog and I still miss her everyday. I'm particularly thankful for the end as in my almost 11 yrs of owning her I've never seen her act like that.

If he hovers for too long, I'll usually have to find some excuse to go back inside to stop talking to him [""Oh! I left some noodles on the stove. Later!""], then just go back inside and he'll continue on his merry way.

Okay, I was nineteen at the time, and I was kicked out of my house. I was living with a friend [Bethany] who lived in a more secluded town. I immediately feel in love with this family. Other than Bethany, I became very attached to her 13 year old sister, Lani. I never had a little sister, so this was my small chance to have one.

Well, just to blow off some steam. We had our fun, but it was time to go. Before we left we stopped in one more store. This store had some off beat things, piercings, shirts that had funny sayings about sex, and in the back was a sex toy area. Lani happened to be looking at some wallets that was very near the sex toy area. Bethany and myself were looking at the jewelry. We were not too far from her and she was old enough to take care of herself in a store, but I still kept an eye on her. 

I am glad I did because some guy came up to Lani holding something quite mature. Bethany

""Yeah

That is all I heard him say before snatching Lani away. The guy was about my age, but I did not care. So we left.

We had parked in a secluded parking lot. There were about three cars sitting in the lot; Bethany's, and we all saw it, so we started making jokes about it. Lani saw that it had a GMC logo on it. She started laughing and shouted. ""It stands for GIVE. ME. CHILDREN. So obvious.""

And if it were on cue
""Maybe we are just hearing things."" Bethany looked worried.

Suddenly we heard muffled screams from inside. 

I am a very maternal person, drive away, but in the mean time memorize or write down the make and the license plate. 

I dashed inside, I could have just asked someone to call the police, or mall police or whatever, but I was not thinking clearly, I just started yelling and screaming, knocking things over. It did not take long for some mall police to come over, and I immediately told them about the van and the muffled screams. They called the real police, and we stayed inside. We watched from parking lot security screens as they pulled out a bound girl from the van. She looked about Lani's age. Then two cops sat in Bethany's car and waited. Eventually

I guess the girl was his younger sister, but we were given some free ice cream and that was neat. I guess what I learned from this was, A. creeps can be a wide variety of ages, and B. Sometimes the ""creeper"" van is an actual creeper van.

TL;DR: Some guy that creeped on my friend's sister ended up having his younger sister bound and gagged in the back of his stereotypical pedo van.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/10e8i2/give_me_children/

In 1964, (probably not in a carseat, in those days), were on a rural, wooded road in the hills of Northeast Alabama not far from my grandmother's house.  

It was close to dusk on a Sunday evening. My mother was driving, a light, pink fabric lifting in the breeze around it. They both realized quickly it was a child. My mother stopped the car. My mother and grandmother got out out, my grandmother holding me, my mother ran to the little girl in the pink dress, white patent shoes. She was clearly dead.

Then, back off the road. My mother walked toward it.  Through the trees stood a little church. The glow of the lights inside shining out--Sunday night services. My mother opened the door. The preaching stopped, the eyes turned to her. My mother doesn't really remember what she said, something like, ""There's a little girl, she's hurt, does she belong to anyone here?"" (She knew the child was dead

Several people, out on to the road. Mother also saw something now she had not seen before. The car that had hit the little girl. It had run off the road down a small ravine. The occupants were not hurt, but were sick, throwing up, just starting to deal with it. My mother realized she must have driven up seconds after it happened.

The people around the little girl realized she was dead. My mother said the parents never said a word. They picked up the little girl

She'd been hearing noises in the roof for a while and assumed it was possums. There's a law here that prevents interfering with possums unless you've got certain qualifications or something

She said that as soon as she said this the three officers that were there all started paying very close attention to what she said. They asked how long she'd been hearing these possums and where in the roof, since she doubted that the possums had ransacked her house and turned the couch upside down, but she answered all their questions. One of the officers asked if he could take a look in the roof. She got him a ladder and showed him where to get up. He disappeared for a few minutes while the other officers waited, looking tense.

Needless to say, until the police contacted her and told her the man had been caught and sentenced. After that she immediately moved into a granny flat out the back of some friends' house.

I was fifteen when we moved away from Kenefick and the bottom. We moved for several reasons; my father got a better job offer in another state

There were more and more cars and trucks driving faster than was safe at all hours of the night. It was a rare weekend that we didn’t see blue and red lights go whizzing by our house or hear a screaming siren. One night a helicopter landed in the field across from our house and was met by an ambulance a few minutes later. We heard later that someone had broken into a house in the bottom and had been shot. It wasn't that tight-knit little community any more. There were more and more strange cars and faces. 

The summer of 1984 was eventful for me on several levels. I turned 15 in July and got my first razor amongst my other gifts. My voice had finally stopped squeaking. I grew to 5’10” (I’m 6’1” now). I was a cornerback on the high school football team. Dad was teaching me to work on cars by fixing up an old ’73 Cougar for me to have when I got my license. And

Her name was Heather and she consumed my every thought

Heather was a year younger than me and we went from hating each other in elementary school to tolerating each other in junior high. When I started high school

By the time she started high school the next year we were a serious item. Her mother and my mother were good friends and her mother would always say something that would embarrass the crap out of me. “You two will have the cutest kids” or “Oh, her dad would give me his sternest look and would say “Be nice.” I knew exactly what he meant and I was always nice; for the most part. 

Heather had diabetes and it always amazed me that she had to get shots every day. Every. Single. Solitary. Day. I was in awe of her bravery and how she just shrugged it off as a part of life. She broke her ankle one summer jumping from a horse that got spooked

About a week after she broke her ankle

Robert was actually a year younger than Heather. He was a tall, but he was never interested. He read a lot and stayed indoors. Heather had already told me that he watched her whenever she was outside, but whenever she waved; he’d act like he didn’t see. He was an OK guy. We got along and he taught me to play Dungeons and Dragons and another game that I can’t remember now. 

His younger brother was named Jason. Jason was an odd duck. His head was too big for his body and his teeth and ears were too big for his head. He was mouthy too. Anything anyone had ever seen or done

He was also a klepto. Pens, baseball cards, ball caps and anything else that wasn’t guarded was fair game. The bad thing was that whenever anyone called him on it, he’d insist that his aunt or a teacher gave it to him. Robert and even his mother would always validate his story. Jason was always the instigator. He would tell one kid that another was talking about him just to see the reaction. Whenever we played a game, he would always want a do-over if things didn’t go his way and if we refused, he’d say we were cheaters and liars. It didn’t take very long for Jason to become unwelcomed around us. 

One day

About a month later

One day a week or so later

Robert and Jason missed school the next two or three days and the next time I saw Robert on the bus

Robert said he ran home, I went straight to that old barn after school that afternoon, but someone had taken it all away. It did smell horrible in there and someone had spread sawdust all over the dirt floor. 

Robert told me that his father and mother had a huge fight the night they found Jason in the barn. Robert’s father was planning to take Jason to a doctor and his mother kept insisting that he was just a little boy doing normal little boy things. Jason wasn’t on the bus for three or four weeks after that. When he did go back to school he wasn’t the same person. He didn’t speak to anyone or respond when spoken to. Obviously everyone had a million and one questions

Eventually; the attempts to get his attention turned to ear flicks and swats to the back of his head but there was never a response. Robert made everyone leave him alone. Then one afternoon

When we moved

Anyways; Heather told me about how Jason was back in school and how he’d get into a fight at least once a week. She said that he was talking now

Over the next few years, but I never said so. I graduated high school in 1986 and sent Heather and invitation. She graduated in 1987 and sent me one of hers in return. I still have it somewhere. She also sent a wedding announcement the following year. That one hit me pretty hard. But by then, I was able to be genuinely happy for her. They didn’t get married though and I cried with Heather over the phone when she told me about their breakup. 

I got engaged myself about six months after that and joined the army two months later. We still sent letters and cards several times a year. Occasionally there would be a tidbit about Jason. He stole a bunch of stuff from the cars that were parked by our old house when the flood came one summer. Someone saw him going from car to car and called the police. He broke all the windows out of another neighbors’ house while they were gone for the weekend. He got caught shooting a pellet gun at someone’s horses once. He was also accused of molesting a little girl from the bottom

In December of 1990

I got a letter from her in the last part of May of 1991 that she’d sent about three weeks earlier. We were still overseas and had no clue when we’d get to go home again. When I opened the letter

At first I thought Heather sent the clipping because we both knew Valerie. She lived two houses down from me; between the house where I lived and Heather’s. She was a nice

After I read the clipping

Heather was able to hear everything because it was a cool night and she'd opened the windows for some fresh air. Her parents were gone somewhere and the air conditioner (a window unit) was too loud. She went on to say that she heard them fighting and crashing into the walls and breaking things. She told me that one of them got pushed into a window and broke it. She said that Jason was screaming so loud that his voice would crack. After about fifteen minutes of this it got quite and then Robert left. 

Heather said that she could hear Jason crying and ranting and screaming to himself. Then she saw him walking in front of her house toward Valerie’s place. Valerie’s husband worked at a grocery store called Brookshire Brothers in Dayton during the day and went to college at night. He was also in the National Guard and was gone one weekend a month and two weeks during the summer. Instead of getting up early on Saturday morning and driving to wherever he went for his National Guard weekends

Heather told me that she didn’t give it much thought because she was trying to concentrate on her books. But then she heard shouting and saw Jason storming back to his house. She just assumed that Valerie didn’t want him at her house; especially if he was high on something. Heather (who was a junior in college at this time) was studying and forgot all about it until she heard shouting again from Valerie’s place about half an hour later. She said that she could hear crying too. She could also hear Jason shouting. She turned off her desk lamp so she could see outside better and when she looked

Heather said it scared her so bad that she couldn't move. She sat in the dark watching and listening but afraid to draw attention to herself by moving or making any noise. Heather said that he was home for about fifteen minutes and then got into his car and left. When he was out of sight she ran over to Valerie’s house. Mr. Votaw; who lived between Heather and Valerie was already there and was calling the police. Valerie’s niece was sitting on the sofa with her legs pulled up to her chest

Heather went on to tell me that according to the nieces statement

The girl said that about twenty minutes later something hit the side of the house and Rontoo started barking. When Valerie opened the door to see what happened

After the dog was in the bathroom he made them go into the bedroom and lay face down on the bed. He wanted to know if they had any money and they told him that there was money in their purses. The niece said he was silent for a minute and then she heard the gun shoot and felt the bed jerk. Then she heard Jason run out of the house. The police found Jason a few hours later at a friends’ house where he was arrested. 

Jason was later tried as an adult and sent to prison. I don’t remember the length of the sentence. As far as I know he’s still incarcerated. I remember him being a weird little kid. I can remember talking about him to some of my new friends after I’d moved and telling them that he was the type of kid that would grow up to be a terrorist or lead a cult. I guess I had him pegged from the start. 

Here is a link to a story about the incident from the Houston Chronicle: 

http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_744058/teen-certified-as-an-adult-for-trial-in-slaying.html

I guess you’re wondering about me and Heather. We eventually got married. But not to each other. She married a man she met in her senior year of college and they live in Conroe

This particular experience was shortly after I had started the job.  I'd always been a pretty naive guy, in the real world.  So starting at a porn store (only my second full-time job at the time) was already a bit of a head-turner.  It was around Christmas, so we were pretty dead at the time, but my boss was there just hanging out (something we all did quite a bit).

At around 9 pm, thick stubble, and wild gray hair.  He was twitchy, and muttering to himself.  With him came the stench of body odor and alcohol.  He had a distinctly crazy air to him, and he instantly made me uncomfortable.  Ed, the manager, was in the back room getting inventory

The guy wandered around the store for a minute or so, when he suddenly said ""have you ever seen anyone with a piercing...you know...down there?""  I said ""um, sure, it's pretty common.""  I have no clue why I even entered into this conversation.  It got weirder, very quickly.  He started rambling, talking about piercings, S&amp;M, but seemed to use only euphemisms and suggestive gestures to refer to genitalia.  Like it was something shameful.  I kept wandering away

I don't remember everything he said

Creep: I like those piercings [referring back to the penis piercings].  I pierced my own thingy with knife

Me: Because you're fucking nuts?!  Jesus christ, and you need to fucking go!  [This was the incident that broke me of my meek non-confrontational nature]

Creep: But I want to talk to someone about this.

When I first got here, when I came home from work, the key wouldn't work in the lock any more.

I was pretty puzzled, and it would have to be replaced completely, including with a new key. It cost me $300 all up, but I was tired and hungry and glad to be back inside, and I thought I could show the receipt to the landlord and be reimbursed.

Being the absent-minded person I am, and give them the new key."" But I never got around to it.

Then

The sound of a key being inserted into my door.

I immediately jerked up in bed and gathered the covers around me, none of them know this address. And besides, how would they get into the secure hallway?

Aside from me

I sat there frozen

Except it didn't. I changed the locks.

As I sat there paralysed with fear

I slipped out of bed and pulled on my work clothes, waiting for them to leave. I was way too scared to breathe too loud or even turn off the TV, in case they realised someone was inside. My door doesn't have a peep hole, but even if it did, I probably would've been too much of a coward to cross my room and stand that close to it. I felt like I was having a mini heart-attack.

The lock was audibly being manipulated at this point. Whoever was on the other side was loudly jiggling the key and shaking the knob

I was still ready to crap my pants, or they got the wrong apartment. It sounds ridiculous, but I needed to prove that I wasn't an irrational person. I needed to prove that this wasn't just some silly mistake I was blowing out of proportion.

So I cleared my throat and let out a feeble: ""Hello?""

The shaking stopped immediately. This was almost worse than the noise from before. Every muscle in my body tensed listening for a sound, the silence, and my mind working in overtime to try to explain who the hell this person was.

Until they knocked on the door. 
I stood dead still in the middle of the room

He knocked again. 
A muffled voice came through the door

""Hey

This might be the part of the horror movie where the dumb girl opens the door

In the absence of my response

At this point

I can't even remember what I said to them, which is a bit embarrassing. I had trouble remembering my address, but luckily it was still on the locksmith receipt still sitting on the table. (I owe that fucking guy a beer).

When I was talking to the operator, because the banging abruptly stopped. Suddenly I was in the Jaws situation again, where the shark is gone but you know it's just under the water. I held onto the knife so tightly that my nails made a mark in the palm of my hand where they wrapped around it, and I kept asking the operator: ""What if he comes back?""

Luckily I didn't have to worry about that. The next people to knock on my door were the cops. They were able to get into the hallway because someone left the shared access door wide open. Of course the perpetrator was long gone.

I still don't know who knocked on my door that night

The last place we hit up was a housing addition the edge of town, so I went up to the next house. 

It looked pretty normal. I mean, legit, I suppose. I went in.

There wasn't a lot of selection. And old coffee maker

The man at the back of the garage sat there smiling the whole time. He was maybe in his late 30s/early 40s, like with rhythm, and kind of swinging them.  

Beneath another table was a huge box of naked Barbies priced .50 cents a piece. I bent down to inspect them. First of all, body odor, just inconceivably *foul*. I was pulling away when the man in the back of the garage started asking me questions, like how old was I, where did I go to school. He asked me if I liked the Barbies.

Not really interested

He started talking about his cockerspaniel named Spiffy or something and then let the dog out when it started scratching on the garage door. It started growling at him, but he gave me the creeps. 

Leaving already? He sounded disappointed.

I told him to have a nice day. 

Ran off to my mom and gran

A week or so later we saw on the news a man broke into a woman's house, at that housing addition. 

Clarification (sort of): Okay, hid in the basement... if I remember correctly, came up after the two were asleep, tied up the mother and the girl, molested her, tried on the mother's clothes...

1354771274.0,14daul,Why meeting roommates on Craigslist is a bad idea...,,341,62,65,"Sorry but be prepared for fairly long story. Here goes:

I was living in Hawaii and had to move to LA for work. I didn't know anyone, I finally found this amazing girl. She was funny, we had similar interests, and she even worked in the same field as me. She didn't yet have a place, but her and another girl were looking at several houses that required a third roommate. They were totally OK with doing all the work seeing as how I was an ocean away. She called or Skyped with me about once a week, and sent me pictures of each house they looked at. All in all, she was incredible. 

Fast forward three months. They found a huge and gorgeous house, and Evann (the original girl from CL) picked me and all my stuff up at the airport. On the ride home she starts telling me horror stories about her past roommates. Every single one had fucked her over in some horrendous way, and she was terrified of being close to people after that. She said she wanted us to be the people who turned that around for her, that she wanted us to be a little family. She then drove us not to the house but to a nearby Starbucks where she chain smoked and told me about her stepdad who was in AA and how she'd briefly been attending NA meetings after a short bout with painkiller addiction, but she had decided she wasn't a drug addict and didn't need it. THEN she admits that she's only known the other roommate for a month and a half. Red flags all over the place. Why would an LA native need to find strangers to live with her on CL? Why the oversharing about drugs and family? Why had she never had a positive roommate experience? But I pushed it all aside, giving this girl the benefit of the doubt. 

A few weeks go by in the house and all's well. I forget she ever seemed off and we start becoming close. Then she takes me on a tour of LA for a day and proceeds to tell me her entire disturbing life story. When I say we had gotten close, getting raped by a lesbian at the hospital and beaten by the guards, attempting suicide, her mother's severe narcotic addiction, her ex fiance having a psychotic break and trying to kill her, her struggles with a chronic kidney illness that required many surgeries, her recent long-term boyfriend disappearing under mysterious circumstances... the horrific stories just went on and on and on. It sounded like something from a movie, but again I give her the benefit of the doubt. 

Again, had confessed to her that she was a compulsive overeater. Naturally, Juliana claims to be innocent. I side with Evann and we start mildly bullying Juliana to try to get her to admit to stealing the food. Then dishes start piling up in the sink and nobody is washing them except me. I ask both girls, and again Evann swears on her life that it's Jules. Finally Jules has had enough. It turns out she's been eating out every meal (we all had extremely different schedules) and Evann lied to my face about the dished and the food. When confronted, Evann starts crying and saying ""how could you accuse me of such things? I'm a good person! I'm a good person!"" and we end up apologizing to her in the end.

Finally the tension builds between the two girls due to many many many repeats of this situation

Now things get really weird. Evann moves out of the master bedroom and starts sleeping in the living room every night. After I repeatedly request that she return to living in her bedroom, but I really wanted to help her out. During this time I see her naked and realize that she has NO scars from her ""repeated surgeries"". Beyond that, she confides in me that she hasn't been working at all this entire time, but going out to score drugs and get high every day, and now she's flat broke. She apologizes for lying saying over and over that she's a sick sick addict and just needs help. I get her into AA and NA as soon as she's able to walk, driving her daily to meetings and holding her hand the whole time. 

My long-time boyfriend and her oldest friend move in with us a short while later, she babbles endlessly about how great sobriety is and how she's finally healing, while clearly nodding out on opiates. I end up finding something suspicious on her computer and she admits to me that she's been working as a call girl and bringing customers to the house. I tell her she has to stop and she claims she already has. 

Around this time she becomes very very physically ill. Finally I get a phone call from her after another absence. She's hysterical. She's, and afterwards disappeared for almost a month. I thought at one point that she was dead until she texted me asking if her cat was ok. 

When she returned, sleeping on the couch, and smoking inside the house (which was not ok with us at all). She was also very clearly on drugs. At first we tried to be nice about it but she lied and lied and lied, even going so far as to say her room was haunted and the ghost made her sleep upstairs. Finally my boyfriend snaps and yells at her. She calls the cops and claims he assaulted her. They didn't believe her but the other roommate did. Then one night when I'm at work she uses pity and sweet talking to convince my BF that we should all be friends again. I told him it was a lie and he didn't believe me. When I get home from work that same night, my room is trashed. I asked if he did it, and of course he didn't. She'd been in there looking for cash or drugs (which I don't do). When I asked her about it, she looked me straight in the eyes and said ""it was the ghost"". 

After that she started sending me insane emails claiming that I had been her best friend and had betrayed her, that my only purpose in life was to torment her. In these emails she claimed that she used drugs on rare occasion and that I had made up everything about her problem, that I had been verbally abusive about her abortion, and that we had repeatedly physically assaulted her. 

We were genuinely afraid for our safety, by four LAPD officers. After that, we just tried to avoid her, but she got the other roommate involved. She even went to far as to claim she had pneumonia from the stress of living with us and our constant abuse. The emails continued to escalate. At one point she said that I had been a sister to her until the evil spirit in me had forced me to abuse her. This was when I realized that her definition of ""abuse"" was a bit skewed, and all her stories about her childhood, exes, old roommates

Now I realized, I hacked into her email. Come to find out she had been telling our landlord that we were heinous criminals, telling her parents that she had been fired from a job because of me and needed money, all kinds of lies. Also, we come to find out that they guy who got her pregnant didn't mysteriously disappear, he ran away because they slept together once and she started stalking him. Obviously everything she had ever said was a creepy lie.

After moving out

This was two years ago. Last month we found out that this girl who claimed to have never been a drug addict and that I made all of it up had died of an OD. She was evil. This wasn't a situation where nobody tried to help a sick person; everyone around her tried to help her and she manipulated and used them. I don't feel sad that she's gone. In fact

I'm currently on holiday in Sydney (Australia) with my family. Yesterday we decided to take the kids (I have a few nieces and nephews) into the city to go to the Aquarium. As most people know or can guess taking public transport into the city can be a big day when you have two three year olds and an eight month old baby with only two strollers (prams). By the time we finished at the aquarium we were all pretty tired
                  
Now, there's a small area with two rows of seats that face each other for disabled people and prams and such, then there are two sets of stairs, one leading up the other leading down to more seating. Since we had two prams we always just sat in the first little area.
           
So we get on the train and there's an older looking guy sitting at the end of one of the seats. He looked homeless, it's a free country, if he wants to ride the train, that's fine. So I sit on the same side as him while the rest of my family sit on the other, except my niece who was asleep in the stroller that I had in front of me. Now, to any one who didn't know us, it would have looked like we were separate parties. My niece and I both have red hair while the others have brown
              
Anyway, but no one else was there, and if they came on I'd move it, no problem. So we reach the station and a young guy jumps on the train and looks over at where I'm sitting. I immediately go to move the stroller, but he just heads downstairs, so I leave it. Apparently the guy sitting there doesn't like this and he starts to mutter.
                
At first I don't pay attention, though, it becomes harder to ignore what he's saying.
""Stupid fucking strollers. Stupid fucking strollers. Stupid fucking strollers.""
He repeats that for about a minute, checking her out. This makes me really uncomfortable, so I turn slightly so she's hidden from view. This also makes him angry.
""Fucking strollers. Turn away from me. Just wait. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Do you hear? I'll kill you.""
I look over at my family and see that they're looking pretty freaked out and shocked. I decide to ignore it.
""I'm going to kill you and keep the kid.""
This time I was scared because unlike before, like he could actually pull it off. We'd just pulled into a station and my brother jumped up and yelled ""Get off the train!"". The guy started laughing and grasping at his coat. It took me a moment to realise my brother was talking to me, not him. We all ran for the doors as they were closing. I heard the guy yell something out and turn to see him leaning on the closed doors with a knife in his hand.

By the time I was born my brother was already friends with a boy named Danny, Sara and I were inseparable and would spend a ton of time together. Danny had developed some problems involving learning disabilities and likely some form of autism, and by the age of 18 he had quite a few friends in their mid twenties who weren't exactly the nicest kind of people.

One such friend was Matt. I cannot, but he was around 21 and a regular cocaine user. Sara (a year older than me and a bit wiser at 13 than I was at 12) would often ask to stay at my house when Matt was over. One day Sara and I walked home from school together to find no one in her house but Matt. He told us he was waiting for Danny to arrive and that he'd opened the door with the spare key hidden under a planter outside. We quickly went to Sara's room and remained there with the door closed.

After a few minutes I left to use the bathroom. As soon as I'd closed the bathroom door it was pushed open again and Matt stepped in after me

Matt stood between me and the door for a few seconds before I managed to get out the words ""excuse me, ""No."" I tried to squeeze past him again.

Just then Sara, providing enough distraction for me to escape past him. Sara grabbed my arm, and hauled me across to the hall to her room, shut the door, and barricaded it with a chair. While Matt knocked on (and tried to force open) the door and asked us to come out and ""talk about it"" Sara hurriedly whispered to me that her mother had told her *never* to be alone with him. I remember feeling more guilty than anything else, like I had broken some huge important rule and everyone would be angry with me. The kind of guilt that gives you and awful stomach ache and makes you want to throw up.

Eventually Matt left and when Sara's mom returned home we told her everything. I never saw Matt again after that. I tried very hard to just forget about the whole thing

He played a lot of games with us, but when you are a kid it's always fun to be scared. When he decided that he wanted to give us a scare, he would start going around the house turning off all the lights one by one. We usually didn't even notice that he was doing it until most of the house was dark. There wasn't really a point to the game except trying to scare us. Sometimes he would go into the backyard through the sliding glass door in the master bedroom, his shirt over his head and dragging his feet. We would scream when we saw him through the window of the living room! At that point we would usually all go find a hiding place, and hope that he didn't catch us.

We always hid in pairs or groups, my oldest sister decided she wasn't going to fit, and took off down the hallway to find another spot to hide. I was alone, and being about 10 at the time, I was terrified. As the sound of her footsteps faded down the hallway, all I could hear was the sound of my own breathing. Everyone was hiding. The house was silent.

Suddenly I heard the sliding glass door open. I froze. I could hear the shuffling of feet on the floor, my grandpa was going to pull the closet door open and jump at me, or make some kind of scary noise to make me scream.

But the scream that came wasn't from me, my grandpas muffled voice, praising them for the good hiding place.

Anyways I guess technically this is my Mom's story

So around 1 or 2 in the morning one night I woke up to the sound of her screaming and the sound of someone running down the stairs.  She ran into my room and although this was about 22 years ago I still clearly remember the look of absolute terror on her face.  She had woken up to the sound of her porch door being slid open.  She looked over half asleep and a man she had never seen before was walking into her bedroom.  Now this is the strange part.  She told me he was completely soaked from head to toe in water, and there were no lakes or bodies of water anywhere nearby.  I know this for a fact because as an 11 year old growing up in NY, being friends with the kid that had a pool was a priority.  And the closest friend with a pool was my friend Jonathan, who lived at least 2 miles away.

So obviously freaked out of her mind she said as she started to jump from bed that he grinned at her and started taking his bathing suit off.  That was when she sprinted out of her bedroom, why my Mother let me do this, but instead of calling the cops and staying locked in my bedroom with her, I grabbed my BB Gun and slowly walked back up the stairs towards her bedroom.  My Mom had called 911 at this point but I didn't know it yet.  So, shaking uncontrollably, I stared at the closed door for about 2 minutes trying to listen but I didn't hear anything.  Finally with my BB Gun drawn I flung the door open and thank Christ he wasn't in there.  The porch door was wide open though, and there was a soaked bathing suit in the middle of the floor.  At that point I went back downstairs and sat with her in my locked bedroom while waiting for the cops to show up.

They got there surprisingly quick and were just as confused as we were by the situation.  They went outside on the porch and confirmed that there were wet spots where the guy had been standing for god knows how long, but the next day my Mom agreed that it was time to get a dog which I'd been begging her for.

I call my dog and walk away. The guy stands up and follows me telling me the devil is in my dog. The first time I thought he was making a reference to dobermans being referred to as devil dogs when they were in the war

I get a little freaked out because I don't want him to hurt my dog. I put her on a leash and he keeps repeating to me that the Devil is everywhere and that it is unfortunate that he has entered her but that I need to kill her now.

When I first arrived in this country I really enjoyed going out and drinking with my friends. Back then everything was so fun and new

Mr. Qu always seemed way too friendly and a little awkward towards me. But he was genuinely nice, and to not reciprocate his sweet words. 

After not seeing him for a few weeks time- he texts me at 9pm one night and asks if I've ever tried Baijiu- which is a traditional Chinese liquor that's basically 60% alcohol. I said I hadn't. He said I should come to the usual bar and he'd buy a bottle so I could taste. At first I agreed out of politeness, telling him that I really shouldn't see him again. And that was that. End of story. I really didn't hear from him again. 

But the story isn't *quite* done yet... 

The lady who owns the bar we usually frequent is a good friend of a classmate's. What I heard from my classmate three days afterwards totally shocked and horrified me. Later I would go to the bar to confirm the story with the owner

It goes like this. Apparently Mr. Qu comes into the bar like he does almost every weekend. Just after 9 he orders a bottle of Baijiu and pours  two glasses. He says to the servers that he's waiting for a girl. Later the girl never comes. He ends up staying anyways and singing some karaoke

A server finds a small glass of Baijiu on the table and drinks it, taking off his clothes, making disturbing noises and eventually falling over, passing out.

The drink Mr. Qu poured for me that night was laced with some kind of drug. His plan was to get me high or passed out

Thank god I had come around and decided not to see him that night, inappropriate, or whatever- it probably is!

We passed a few dilapidated Victorian homes as we neared the downtown. Suddenly I heard a soft voice saying ""Rachel."" Not even as a question
""Jason?"" She asks. He skulks out of the shadows of the porch and meets us at the gate.
""Rachel."" He says again. He has a very high-pitched effeminate voice. He asks who I am

""Can I ask you something?"" he asks her hesitantly. 
""Of course
""Have we been talking.... like this?"" He gestures from his head to hers
My mom just smiles back and says ""Nope."" He looks at her
""Are you sure..?""
""Yep."" She says, as I was completely uncomfortable and wanted to just walk away awkwardly.
Jason then goes on to talk about how he just recently got his psychic powers and they haven't developed completely yet. Then goes off on a tangent on past lives, but he knows now that she's in a better place and he's doing much better.
My mom tells him she's glad he's feeling better

As we walk to my house I ask her ""He's schizophrenic
""Paranoid schizophrenic. He visits the shop regularly (the bike shop my parents owned at the time). He's taken quite a liking to Chad (my step father.) Jason's come over to our house a few times
At this time my stepfather was away on a week-long backpacking trip with his friends. So it was just my mom, I'd protect her. (I've been in Kung Fu a few years, and I am definitely too cocky about such things, especially as small as I am, but anyway...) 

So a few days later, but I could tell she was a bit more shaken up than she was letting on. My mom told me she had been napping in her room with the baby when she heard my younger brother Derek talking. She didn't think anything of it until she heard someone else respond and Derek say ""She's in her room."" So Jason walks into the room with her lying on the bed with the baby. My mom then proceeds to tell him to leave and that this isn't a good time. He makes excuses and tells her he needs to be there. She gets more and more frantic as the minutes go by, still he wont leave and her phone is in the living room. At one point he asks her ""Oh, am I scaring you?"" She tells him ""Yes, you're scaring me, and you need to leave now."" He tries to calm her down and apologizes for scaring her but that he knows he can help the family. ""I was in love with Chad in a past life,"" he keeps saying. 
Finally my mom picks up the baby and walks into the kitchen with Jason still following her and calls the cops
Cops patrolled the house at night and one evening they caught him trying to break in. As far as I know

What kills me is that I had barely left the house. I could have been there to help, at least. It kills me to know that my mom was caught off-guard, sleeping with the baby, and that my little brother Derek was alone with that man. Now, I don't think Jason would have hurt them. I believe he was more of a danger to himself. But you never know. And next time it could be someone who does intend to hurt them. Poor Derek is really shaken up after that, too. Needless to say, my parents have been locking up much more regularly. 

And this is why I want to be a criminal psychologist.

I wish this hadn’t happened to me


I went to college in New Orleans a couple of years before Hurricane Katrina (I was a senior when it hit). During my first year


One afternoon, I never really felt unsafe. Well, that was about to change. 


I had a couple of shopping bags and was waiting at the bus stop, but only every hour at the most. I had a bit of a wait ahead of me. The stop was near a levee (dirt embankment meant to keep the water from the lake/river out of the city – the things that broke when Katrina hit). Behind the levee were only train tracks and water. Pretty much, I was standing on a deserted road, in a crummy part of town, with nothing but water, pavement, and rail road tracks. 


I felt okay, and the bus would be along eventually. 


I waited and waited and waited. No bus. Then I heard a voice behind me. I turned and saw a boy coming over the levee and walking towards me. He was about 10, at least. 


I didn’t know where he had come from, but not too creepy. I tried to brush him off and ignore him. It didn’t work. 


He started grabbing for the bags and being more insistent that I give him something. I didn’t have anything that would interest a kid


Then it got creepy. He started to grab at me


I looked around for anyone who could help, hoping the kid would go back home or wherever it was he came from. 


That’s when he decided to grab me again, no. I pushed him off me, loathe to touch him. He was sticky, as kids tend to be, and sweaty. Plus, he’s a creeper, but still a kid. I was a little bigger than he was, which was apparently on the other side of the levee


I don’t think so. No one builds a house on the water side of the levee. Levees are built to keep water away from the houses. He couldn’t possibly live on the other side of it. I wasn’t going anywhere with this kid


He followed me


Luckily


The kid ran up on the levee, praying a bus would come soon, I heard rocks hitting the pavement. I turned and saw the kid crouching on top of the levee, throwing rocks at me. I had been annoyed and creeped out before, but this was starting to actually get dangerous. They were good-sized rocks, and sharp. 


A few minutes later, but I didn’t care at that point. I took a ride to the casino about a mile or two down the road, where the driver let me get a transfer to the right bus. I made it back to my dorm room and never went back to that part of town alone again. 


I kind of wonder what the deal was, there could have been a group of guys back there using the kid to lure me out of sight so they could do god-knows-what to me. 


TL;DR: while waiting for bus

1330865747.0,qh4ac,I creeped out [MY] creeper!,alwannisch,317,41,33,"So three bits of important background information: 1) At the time of this event I dressed hobo-chic. 2) I have this weird eye condition where my tear ducts don't function properly and sometimes they get stuck shut so my eyes get dry and then my eyes try to produce a bunch of tears but they're stuck behind the tear duct opening so the pressure builds up until the ducts are forced open: aka resulting in literal streams of tears coming out of my eyes. 3) my grandparents (and parents less so) spoke Pennsylvania dutch (actually a dialect of German) and as a child I would talk to my grandparents in the dialect but they died when I was a pre-teen and I began to study Standard German and was studying German in college when this event took place.


So, he didn't notice me till I was very close and my heart dropped when I heard the stillness broken. ""Ain't you a pretty sight!"" Thanks to the alcohol I didn't flinch or react much at all. Thinking I hadn't heard he yelled after me ""Honey, these are dangerous streets for a pretty thing like you!"" My heart was thumping so hard but I had already been walking fast the entire time and I wouldn't let myself pick up the pace (not wanting to look afraid). It was silent for a bit and I thought I was fine. ""Where's you going? Lemme walk ya! I gotta pad too!"" His voiced didn't sound farther away this time and I heard his footsteps, but he was a lot more fucked up than me and he wasn't walking nearly as fast. 

Now comes the stupid mistake:


I saw a stairwell to the subway I wanted and I walked down it. I immediately knew I fucked up. He had obviously seen me descend down there but the train was just leaving and the plat form was now empty. Adrenaline pumping through me

This whole time I hadn't looked back but I couldn't help looking back now. But catching his eye, clearing my throat, and scratching my face hard as well. I basically did that as he put his hand on my shoulder, but I guess he was surprised by the scratching fit and let go and took a few steps back. It was right then that my eyes just started pouring (but keep in mind not crying so no sounds or anything and when I had just looked back a moment before he got a good glimpse of my face and saw there were no tears). He was still for a few seconds. A bit confused I think. Then I felt that he was edging around to get a look at my face. Now I hadn't spoken PA dutch in a long while when as he was almost able to look me in the face I don't have a clue why but I suddenly turned to him and just said ""Awwer alldieweil, hot die Daab die Katz im Aag ghatt."" (But all the while the dove had its eye on the cat). It's a proverb my grandpa would say meaning that sometimes whom you're plotting against is really plotting against you (or it also sort of means you never know who has an ace up their sleeve/don't underestimate people) .

1372848450.0,1hk656,Locked in and Locked out,sinenox,313,40,47,"Warning: Longest story ever. Sorry. Meat of the story begins after the line below. 

At the time this took place I was in high school, but this one is probably the most human-oriented. My job was to tech (help the doctors do injections, surgeries, etc) and do general kennel duties, which mostly involved cleaning cages. 

There are only three more things you need to know before I can get to the meat of this. First, since we usually worked in pairs. Second, the doctor who owned the clinic got some kind of tax incentive to hire kennel staff through a program that tried to place mentally-ill people. Since I was the only one who didn't complain about working with these people, I was almost always paired with one. It doubled my work load generally, but they left me alone so I didn't really mind. Finally, the general layout of the place was [this](http://i.imgur.com/SEDxclO.png).  
____________________________________
On the night of this story I was working with a woman who was very disabled. She was supposed to clean the cages and mop the floors and such but I generally tended to do all of that over once she was done so we didn't get yelled at in the morning. She was very nice, and prone to drama and tantrums. I don't remember her name, but Shelly seems fine. 

Everyone had left a bit early for the day for whatever reason

At one point around 5PM when I was taking that dog to the outdoor run to do his thing, balding on top, weird around the temples, and a woman. The guy's pants were around his ankles and he was pounding the woman, who he appeared to be pushing over and holding her hair. I assumed it was a prostitute. This caught me off guard, and I froze for a moment, pretty sure they hadn't heard me. Just as I'm backing away to go back inside the man looks up and gets this...what I can only describe as a predatory look on his face, but I merely grimaced at him and quickly went back in. I avoided putting dogs outside for a bit

Around 9PM I finally get my lunch break, and I note that there are fewer people on the street than usual (likely a holiday). After grabbing my food I head back, but I still see no one. Because I can't shake the feeling, I pick up my pace and jog back to the door quickly. As I'm fumbling for my keys, still scanning the empty parking lot in the dark, I notice a small movement. Something shiny, under one of the cars. It's a shoe. Someone is ducking down behind it. Then I'm inside and the door locks automatically. I tell Shelly not to go outside and go upstairs to eat. After thinking about it for a while I decide not to call the cops, it's another 3-4 hours until I get out

More drudgery. At what I figure had to be around 10:20, she's arguing with someone. I'm down the stairs in a blink, and she's talking out the back door, raising her voice now in confusion and frustration. 

Shelly: ""I don't know how to get there! I told you I don't know...why do you still ask me things I don't know the answer to?!""

I have yet to hear him speak, and sure enough it's the same guy. The moment he sees me, he gets the creepiest fucking smile on his face, and starts to advance as though he's going to come inside. I immediately shove the door back but he fights it from the other side. Bad news. Luckily I'm surprisingly strong for my size and I'm wearing work boots for traction so even after he sticks an elbow in the door I'm still throwing myself against the door yelling ""NOT TODAY, FUCKER...GET BACK. GET OUT OF HERE. (CALL THE COPS.) GET. OUT. (GIVE ME THE BLEACH.)"" and within a few seconds I give him enough room to take his arm back and when he pulls it out I throw myself against it and the door shuts. And locks automatically. 

It's metal, or didn't understand where he was, and not to worry. They promise to send some guys over to search the lot and surrounding area and call me back. I do perimeter walks inside until they do, securing everything even remotely questionable. Every time I hear a strange thump I have to go investigate it by myself, with a flashlight. They call back and say that they went over it a few times, and there was no one there. Probably scared him off. Call back if we have any more problems. 

Okay. Fine. Good. Now I'm behind on my work, a giant rottweiler, goes to the bathroom in his cage. It's mostly blood. Shit. That's not good. He continues to bleed from the anus. I'm going to have to take him to emergency. I call one of the doctors to confirm. Shelly takes the phone and histrionically screams that the dog is bleeding in to the receiver. Helpful. They say to get him to the emergency clinic the next town over ASAP. So, there is a work vehicle there that I can use, but I can't keep him stable and drive at the same time. Also it's going to take an hour to do the paperwork and etc and our own work is way behind, and we're not supposed to run overtime. I consider leaving Shelly there but obviously I can't do that. She can't really be trusted to make good decisions. So I decide to take everything and try to coach Shelly on how she needs to hold the dog in the car. She protests that she doesn't want to go anywhere. But starts to whine and flip out when I say I have to go, because she doesn't want to be left alone. Finally I convince her. I get the gear, we're going. 

I pause just as I'm about to open the back door. I just have that sinking, and I see nothing, though I still feel watched. Then I notice there are shoe prints near the front door, from the recent rain. Someone could have just taken shelter on their walk. Maybe. I go to the back and decide to walk out on the run, which is fenced in and covered, to see if anyone is visible in the lot. I wait. No one is there. It's decided then. I turn around to go and I hear a noise. The creepy feature emerges from the landscape, like some kind of fucking awful Where's Waldo game that I just lost. He's still smiling like a demon, all questions. He puts his hand on the rusty fence and shakes it. It is pretty flimsy. I'm noping backwards with speed but the door wont open. Shelly has been watching the whole thing and she's freaking out. She's scared of him getting in, you know

Me: Shelly

Shelly: No he's bad I don't want him coming in here. 

Me: Shelly

Shelly: No..I don't...I don't want...

Me: OPEN THE DOOR RIGHT NOW! 

Shelly: You're being mean to me

CF: It's fine..are you worried about me? It's fine. Do you work here? (violently shaking the chainlink

Me: Shelly! I'm sorry. I have to...[animal name] is hurt, right? And you need me to help you...but I can't help protect you or [animal name] unless you let me in! 

Shelly: ...Ok...ok..yeah...but... Promise you aren't mad at me!

Me: I promise! Yes!

Finally I get back inside. The rott is smiling, shit! Also, if he's willing to break a fence he'll break that glass. I dial 911 and tell them to get over here. I also tell them I might not be here, and where I'm en route to, and to call me back when they get there. Then I call my dad (by now it's 11:45ish) and ask him to get up and help me transport an injured animal. While we wait, the dogs in the runs are barking. 

Creepy was gone by the time my dad and the cops got there. The rott got the attention he needed and was just fine afterwards. When I got yelled at the next day for not finishing the mopping I put in my 2 weeks notice (I'd worked there over a year)

Last night, he was completely hammered. He had taken a taxi, so he asked if he could borrow some money for cab fare. I told him I'd take care of it, and I went out to pay the driver. 

On my way out to pay him, staring at this car. It looked so familiar. I got an eerie feeling, and I went back inside. I bolted the door (with new locks!). I went back to studying, ended up falling asleep in the kitchen (which faces our front door directly). 

At about 4:30-ish

I got up, anyway.) I went to go check on Mark, to make sure he wasn't choking on his own vomit (he was sooo fucking drunk). And then I went to bed.

I woke up a few hours later, and it showed his recently added friends. And one of them was Chad (I guess he never deleted him?). And Chad's profile picture was of him standing beside the same car I saw last night sitting in the parking lot.

This old guy would go into a friends job and pretend to be a massage therapist. He had fake cards made up and would give them to my friend who was 16 (looked younger). He kept trying to get him into his car to go back to his house for a massage. The guy was very creepy and used a fake name

One night a bunch of friends were hanging out and I suggest I prank call this guy. I get on the phone making a baby voice saying i was 7

After an hour he leaves and we follow him back to his house. It looks straight out of a nightmare. The neighborhood was nice but his house was covered with trees so thick you couldn't see the front door.

We do a reverse search on his address and get his real name. Confirmed child molester. We called the cops but they said they couldn't do anything because he ""didn't actually molest the 7 year old at the park"".

We leave it be for about 5 years then one night drive past his house. It's boarded up and most of the trees are cut down. We asked a jogger about the man who lived there. He said the guy was a creep and a molester and died alone. No family.

Next logical step: we break into the house. 

We go near the steps in the back yard and find hidden steps down. The door is locked from the outside. We unlock it and go in. The basement had old photo developing equipment (or so my friend said). But not much more. We go upstairs and notice the lock is on the outside of the basement door. We continue through the house and we come to the hallway. It was about 8 doors. All locks on the outside.

One late afternoon handful of years ago

Turns out

She lets me in and just starts going into how she got super creeped out earlier

""You know our attic upstairs? How there's a railing at the very top where the stairs end? I had to move some stuff out of my room and take it upstairs

Her room was downstairs on the first floor and she had two flights to go up. 

""But when I got to the attic

I cut her off and said that we should probably go outside cause that didn't sit too well with me. But she continues to say no, no real signs of entry or anything. 

However, were both convinced that it was either some homeless person or simply, she was just seeing things. 

Soon after, haha), I was bent on telling them she was seeing things and we were fine.  

At the end of the night

She calls out to her roommate and her roommate answers from downstairs and starts to walk upstairs to the bedroom. We tell her we think we heard something upstairs and we waited in silence. Again

It's hard to put into words what I actually thought. I didn't take it as a threat or feel any real danger, there's three of us"". Looking back, as I type this, that was all probably a defense mechanism because I was so afraid of it actually being SOMEthing. 

But the three of us, but I was going to  walk upstairs to the door and try to listen for something else. 

But right then

In an instant, even if we outnumber whoever just walked downstairs. The amount of pressure I put on the doorknob and the door itself was at some superhero level. I felt like I was going to faint for how scared I was. 

It's quiet for a moment and the doorknob begins to turn and I can feel some pressure from the door pushing on me. Someone is trying to get in. 

It gets quiet again and suddenly

As you can imagine

Then as quickly as it began

I held the door shut as my one friend called the police. What seemed like an eternity

My friend opened the bedroom door and raced downstairs to greet the officers and I kept the door shut again. They made their way upstairs and we showed them around. They checked the attic out and didn't find anything but also mentioned the possibility of someone coming in through the window from the other house

My friends and left the house that night and they broke their lease immediately

My husband was sleeping his way back to good health in the hospital after a nasty infection. The man never went to the doctor, I had to catch up on year-end reports. It wasn't unusual for me to come in on days we were closed- my coworker Lolo would be there, which meant I could bring my daughter. Lolo was childless, though she had tried for many years before her husband passed away to concieve. She was in this particular Sunday to work on the company newsletter, and as it was a rather simple project, she often asked to play with my daughter Via when I brought her in.

The day started off normal. As I crunched the numbers and prepared my reports, I said sure. What could it hurt? We were the only ones in the building, and Via loved to look at all the cars.
A half hour passed. I thought it was odd that they were gone so long, I noticed Lolo's shoes, she looked like she was lying face down, still, in the hallway. My heart raced as I ran out to see what happened.
Via was nowhere in sight. I flipped open my phone and dialed 911, but I couldn't. My daughter was gone, Lolo had been knocked out. Something was wrong with this picture, and by the time they got there, it could be worse. I dropped the phone when I heard a tiny, tiny scream in the distance. It was coming from the Parts department, an area of the building that remains locked when business is closed. The only way in is with a key

I ran to the door and shoved it. It was locked. I saw her standing in an aisle, she tried to run to the door. He grabbed her and ran to the back of the room, out of sight. I was about to lose it when I saw the propane tank nestled behind a display to my right.

I grabbed it and threw it through the glass. It shattered and I unlocked the door and raced in. I heard her cries from the upstairs stock room and headed up stairs as fast as I could go. As I ran, rounded the corner to the stock room, peering down the aisles trying to find her. Aisle 1- nowhere in sight. Aisle 2, nowhere in sight. What I saw in aisle 3 chilled me to the bone.
The owner's son, but as he hit the middle of the steps, he was blocked off by police officers.

Via was fine physically. We've been taking her to a child therapist to work through the trauma. I'm just glad she's too young for this to really form into a memory. As for the crazy man who took her, she recovered and never came back to work, though we remained in touch.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/uqa76/the_day_a_crazy_man_took_my_baby/

He didn't take this too well and started stalking her




In the beginning it wasn't that bad. She would ""coincidentally"" run into him places




This frustrated him, I began to stay with my dad a lot more (I didn't normally stay with my dad because of his alcoholism), and my mother and sister stayed with my grandmother/grandfather.




As soon as my mom started staying with them




Months went by and my mom had heard nothing from Will. I went back to living with my mom and things returned to the way they used to be




One of the nights I stayed with my dad, my mom's phone number came up on the caller ID. My mom automatically knew that Will was in the apartment.




It took the police no time to get there, they saw him in a chair facing away from them. He got up thinking it was my family members coming home, and gave the police a clear view of the knife in his hand.




Will was hauled off to the police station while some cops searched the apartment. First they discovered a broken window (it was a first floor apartment), they found that alcohol had been poured all over the bed and shards of glass were everywhere. After that came the most chilling discovery: a lighter on the bedside table.




While Will was in jail, and strapped me into my car seat in the back. She walked around to the front of the car, and as she started to get into the driver's seat she noticed a man in the passenger seat. He cursed at her, and as she ran around to the back to get me, he escaped.
The cops were called




Because of police apathy, and my mom of course said no.




Desperate to be with her, he grabbed a gun a shot himself in the leg, knowing it wouldn't cause much harm. Little did he know, he shot right into a major vein/artery, so he bled to death right on the spot.




This story always gives me chills when I hear it. My family never even told me about this until I was 12. If my sister hadn't begged to stay with my grandparents out of nowhere

1362641872.0,19u2fm,The Hello Guy,boomable,310,40,59,"This is my first Reddit post ever and not exactly the most exciting encounter

    
From the time I was 12 until I was 18, my mother received sporadic phone calls from an unknown caller that we both came to call the ""Hello Man"". The reason for this is fairly simple: when he called he would say hello several times in a monotonous voice with a short, evenly timed pause between each utterance. The only time he ever called was when no one happened to be there so each call was recorded on the messaging machine. Each time the call was made from a blocked number or a public place and it goes without saying that it wasn't a voice we recognized (else the person would have eventually been approached about it).

    
The first few times we wrote it off as being a wrong number or a prank. It wasn't exactly threatening in any way and it wasn't even unsettling to us

    
After a few years, but nothing more. It even became a bit of a running joke in the family, weaving into the idle comments that made up our days and small talk between one another. In all the years we received the calls, the messages were always the same and no other contact was made between this person and us.

    
About two years before she eventually moved out (for unrelated reasons), the tone and pacing was different. There was barely a pause between each word and he was louder, almost panic-y in the way he spoke.

    
Later that week

    
The small sense of fear disappeared quickly, after this point, the calls came even more infrequently than before and we all but forgot about the Hello Man in the times between. 

    
At the end of those six years (three years ago now) I was staying with my mom nearly full-time to help her pack up and organize. Due to some various personal issues, and I) for a short time before finding a new place for herself. On one particular night, when it was just me and my mother spending the night at her now nearly-barren apartment, we received the last call from the Hello Man. An actual call while we were there, not a message left for us to find hours or even just minutes later. At the time, we'd been taking a break and watching a movie, which was just the reason we'd still kept the couch, and dvd player at the apartment.

    
""Hello. Hello. I know you're there this time. Hello."" There was a long pause during which we heard nothing, he started quoting a line from the movie that had been said just a few minutes before. The machine beeped and cut him off, but he didn't call back. Needless to say, we called my grandfather to come pick us up because we didn't want to spend the night there any longer.

1333013515.0,rj0vp,Lead Into an Ambush,Redebidet,294,27,28,"When I was about 18 living in a new city

The guy told me to meet him in a public place, and asked if I could take him to pick up the laptop.

It seemed kind of fishy, so I gave the guy a ride to pick it up.

I started getting a bad feeling about the situation. I'm a safe driver, make sure to signal and check my blind spots, all that stuff. Well my glancing at the mirrors made my passenger chirp up and say ""Don't worry about them following us, I just owe them some money, when you buy the laptop from me I'm just going to pay them."" Hmmm, so apparently the car behind us was the one that dropped him off, and full of 5 sketchy looking guys, red flag city. I had no idea I was being followed until my passenger anxiously piped up.

So the transaction which was supposed to occur in a public place was now being shifted to some private area. I have cash on me. Five sketchy guys are following me and I have one in the car who is way waaaaay too anxious about what's going on. It became extremely obvious they were planning on robbing me. I wasn't freaked out

Sometimes people tell stories like this but they really just over reacted

So the area we were driving didn't have many people milling about, so I realized I needed to get to a more public place, to keep them from acting. If I stopped right there and tried to kick him out he might pull a weapon and try to rob me right then if we're isolated, or maybe he would struggle and give his friends time to get out of their car and rush me while I tried to get him out the door.

I kept following his directions to get to the apartment complex where the laptop was supposed to be so I could ""buy"" it, these guys had some hard ass ideas going through their head.

Anyways, they could be on me too fast. So I noped it right the fuck out of there. I gunned it pass the entrance, the guy in my car was like ""Whoa you just missed the entrance, you were supposed to turn back there."" I accelerated to get some distance between me and his friends. They accelerated too.

I nailed my brakes to try stop and try to kick the guy out, and you could tell they were trying to decide what to do. My idea was to kick him out right there, but for the guys behind me you could see gears turning in their head and that they were going to jump out of their car and rush.

In the moment of their indecision

I got a few hundred yards distance from his friends before they could flip their car around and follow. I braked hard and pulled over

Even if someone is planning on robbing you one minute, he sat there a moment considering what he should do. He looked at me like he was sizing me up, he looked back to see if his friends are right behind us to give him a hand, but they aren't, and he knows I'm serious and can't BS for 20 seconds for them to get there. Shit is going to get real really fast if he doesn't move.

He kind of gave me a knowing smirk, and they followed for a bit then gave up because I headed right to a very busy and public area-- knowing that they wouldn't try something in a crowd.

""Mrs. Anderson"" He said
We invited him in and he made straight for the laundry room (which was upstairs and hidden from sight).
I thought it a bit strange that he knew were everything was
He took his tools out
My mother and I walked with him out of the house. I noticed that he kept trying to make conversation (presumably to stay in the house).

Soon after he left
The witness (a good friend of my mother's) said that she was taking out her trash at around 6:00 a.m. and saw a man she didn't recognize entering our home. She had assumed it was just a friend of mine that was staying with me. When she saw the man again in the afternoon, carrying a toolbox""
It was ""Jacob""
My mother and I gave his description to the police
Nothing happened that night.

Fast forward to midnight the next day. I was getting into bed after watching a movie. I threw my day clothes onto the bed and bent over to get some pajamas out of my suitcase. What I saw horrified me. There were muddy boot prints all around the case. They were disfigured

My account is a throwaway and after this I will never speak of it again. I am typing as it comes out so pardon the horrible punctuation/grammar.

I am 25 now and when this happened I was 14 (f) doing online schooling at home. I still had to take certain tests at the high school down the road from me. I lived with my mom and step dad in the northeastern part of Ohio. 

The time came when I had to take a state test and that morning my mom dropped me off at the high school. The night before this I had made arrangements with my real dad to pick me up around noon (when the tests would be over)

I finished early

I reach the plaza and have to walk down a hill and past several stores that have went out of business. I see a man (tall, but just kept my head down and approached him (to pass by). When I went to walk past he stopped fidgeting with the flag and looked directly at me. The man didn't say anything so I just went back to looking at the ground and at this point the dollar store was only a few more doors down so I kind of started walking faster. I then hear really loud stomping behind me and I turn around to look and he is following, so then I was basically jogging to the store. I was scared, but some part of me  said he is not really following me and he probably is just going to the only store open in the plaza. 

Once I am in the store I keep looking for him while I head to where the long distance phone cards are. Now I am just standing there pretending to get what I need yet I am basically scanning my surroundings. I see him now, but I felt stupid for saying anything to the cashier. I talked myself into saying something once it was my turn in line. I told the cashier that I think that man is following me and I don't know what to do, she looks back to who I am pointing at (he is now looking at a book) and says ""I don't think he is, people wait for the bus here all the time and it is probably your imagination."" I felt stupid, paranoid, and uneasy, I just stood there with her looking at me... I really didn't want to leave the store. Finally after three minutes of getting looked at like I was insane I left. 

Once I am out of the store I start walking fast through the rest of the plaza. I feel relieved that he was not following me anymore. In a couple more steps I hear the bell on the dollar stores door, I look back again and he is now running full speed. 

I have to cross and follow the road to get home so I run across the street when I see no cars and I am just running as fast I can run. It is a busy road

I did have some luck that day. My house key was never on a key chain

I now see my house and I am not looking back, I thought there was a possibility he didn't see what house I went into. As I am hiding behind the recliner I hear footsteps coming up the back stairs and then I hear tapping. I am hysterical at this point and not even thinking straight, I look around the corner to see him standing at the back door. I see hear tapping and then all of a sudden he starts pounding against the glass pretty hard. I was frozen just looking and then he presses his face against the glass and starts repeating in the sweetest voice ""I can see you, I can see you."" 

I was crying and telling him to leave, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind I hear something coming from the basement. The first few times that I heard it I didn't realize that he was kicking in the basement window. So what happened next was fast, I projectile vomited across the room and laid on the floor (yeah, not the best reaction). I then lay on the floor and give up, I feel fucked. 

As I am laying there screaming I hear beating on the door again and I look up to see my dad (it took me a few moments to realize it was him). I ran to the door (still screaming) and opened it to my dad saying ""WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING

Six months later, I see the guy tapping on my back door, same eyes looking right at me, I hauled ass up the steps ran into my mom and step dads room and jumped on top of them both while they were asleep to go get him. He was gone by the time they realized what was happening and went down there. 

After all of this my sister was visiting and up late on the computer downstairs and seen someone looking in the window (who fit the guys description). Several times after that someone tried to bust open our windows which my mom eventually screwed permanently closed. After a while we moved, I assumed I was safe. I lie to my family now to make it sound like I go out here doing exciting things and the truth is I don't really leave the house unless I am with my friends or boyfriend.

My husband is out of town this weekend, like BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. But I tend to have really vivid dreams, so even though I woke up and my heart was racing I didn't realize the sound was real at first. Then I heard it again - BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. I know what it *sounded* like to me  - it sounded like someone was trying to break down my front door using only their fist. But I got out of bed anyway. Usually when this sort of thing happens it turns out my cat is stuck in a cupboard or something, so I thought I'd be able to stop the sound and relieve my fear if I did a little investigating. 

Not this time. I got halfway down the stairs when I saw him. Well, and he knocks again. BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. I had my cell phone with me, and I called the police. A woman answered the phone and I explained what was happening, that I was scared.

While we were talking he knocked again - BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG - loud enough for the dispatcher to hear it over the phone.

1355156467.0,14lxwy,Stranded in an airport while traveling alone,turquoisebackpack,308,37,45,"Hi guys! I’m a 20-year-old female, I was slightly okay with returning to the essays and research papers

I was flying alone, and I happen to look a lot younger than 20. Most often, people say I look 13 or 14 at the most. I’ve always hated this about myself, but I’m told I’ll be grateful when I’m older. As of now, it’s just immensely frustrating. The last time I was on a plane by myself, the attendant thought I was an unaccompanied minor named “Taylor.” I quickly assured her I was not the minor in question. The time before that, I was asked to move away from the emergency exit

Anyways, and tried to look my best (which is difficult to do when traveling). When the plane arrived in Dallas, we had some really terrible weather and the turbulence was scary, but no matter, soon I would be on another flight to Houston. I took the train around to the C terminal, and made my way to my gate only to find that, due to torrential rain and lightening, but determined

“Are you alone?” he asked me. Everyone seemed to be conversing with one another, so I answered him truthfully and continued to wait in the line. The man behind the counter said I was in luck, that there were only two seats left on another flight to Houston, and that I could make it if I hurried.
I rushed to board the train to the A terminal to catch my new flight, and was in the same boat. I exchanged my ticket for a later flight, and resolutely marched myself to the new gate only to be told the same as before. This happened, literally, two or three more times (because I didn’t want to give up and really had no other options). The man shadowed me during the entire ordeal, and I didn’t really find it strange. We were just two individuals stranded in an airport.

The last gate I went to, I’ll rent us one? You can sleep and I’ll drive.” I look at him, and the way he is staring at me scares me. I finally begin to feel that something is off. I respond, “Uh, no, but thank you. I’m going pretty far.” His smile falters for a moment, then he suggests that he buy me some food. I am starving. I am tempted. I hesitate for a moment, and decline him again.

He follows me. I don’t know why, how about this place?” He has this strange look on his face and is standing far too close to me. I shake my head and say, “I told you, I’m really not hungry.” Lie. Big lie. I can smell something delicious, and I almost give in. But my face does not betray my hunger and I keep my pace.

“Okay okay, not in a catty sort of way, just a, ‘Wow, that guy was persistent’ kind of thing.
I settle into a chair to think about my options. I feel pretty alone and worried. My latest ticket has me leaving around midnight, and didn’t fancy sleeping in a chair. The last time I fell asleep in public (on a train in France) a lady attempted to steal my backpack (but that’s another story).

I look up about 30 minutes later to see the same man walking towards me. I tuck my legs up in my chair nervously

“Hey there. Still here?” he asks. He seems to have cooled down. I just stare at him. He clears his throat and tries again. “So I was thinking

I shake my head, I’m fine.” Then turn my attention back to my phone. I didn’t even make eye contact. I felt really uncomfortable. He tries to convince me, and I have to say “no” firmly several more times. He looks angry. Really angry. His hands are clenched and his smile is obviously fake. It looks as if he will shatter his teeth if he clenches his jaw any tighter. I wonder to myself why he hasn’t left the airport yet. Then I notice that his luggage is no longer with him. He was rolling it behind him, and now he isn’t. Where would he have put it if he hadn’t left yet? And so much time has passed, why is he back here? As I’m thinking all of this he is just standing there. Staring.

After what feels like forever he storms off again. I feel so anxious because of him that I grab my things and move to a different gate to wait. My phone was dying, and I was talking to her telling her how creepy the dark weather outside looked, when I see him. Again. Walking around, glancing here and there, in search of me. I hunched down even farther, but my pink jacket was like a beacon. He locked eyes with me, and I looked down. My sister said to stay on the phone

“Well there you are.” He says, I finally look up.  “So you are still here. Look, you need to come with me. You can stay with me at my grandparents tonight, they would love to have you! They won’t mind me bringing you at all. Just come with me.”

I got chills. I don’t know why

“You said you were staying with your aunt.”

His face dropped. It went from cool and collected to something else. Not even anger this time
The entire time my sister is saying

I go back to my conversation and he says

I call my boyfriend and tell him about each exchange, and lay down between two different isles, out of view. A boy my age walks by and asks, “Why are you laying on the floor?” and I respond a tad aggressively with, “Because I want to.” He laughs, and puts his hands up, the unspoken sign for ‘Woah, and because he seems harmless and I mention my boyfriend

A little while later
Maybe he was just some middle-aged man trying his luck at getting a girlfriend or something

Gender: female

Sorry This is so long

I had been home alone, work, or just walking for fun. This particular route I walked almost daily, but always with my fellow (male) roommate.

It was 6:30PM when I left my apartment, texting away on my phone, as my generation often does, when a big, bright red ford explorer pulls up next to me at around 6:35PM--I know because my phone was out. ""Hey hun, you want a ride?"" no, I did not want a ride. ""Are you sure? I can take you anywhere you want to go."" Yes, and it wasn't uncommon for men in cars to beep at me

For starters, and about 5""10"" with short brown hair. Clean. He was wearing a navy blue polo, sunglasses, and a smile. He looked just like any suburban dad you might meet. For all I know he is one.

After my polite refusal, that same cherry red explorer made a sudden and illegal U-turn in the middle of a three-way intersection not far from where I was. The car came at me with alarming speed, and stopped hastily just a few feet from where I stood, paralyzed with fear and confusion. He opened his car door and stepped out, still smiling that suburban smile, looking right at me. My mouth was dry. I still couldn’t fully process what was going on. Was he lost? Did his car break down? “Are you okay?” Even to my own ears my voice sounded meek. He did not speak. He just continued moving, continued smiling that smile, and why that specifically haunted my dreams for so many nights to come. He seemed almost… like a lion about to pounce on his prey. It was in this moment I became aware that everything was not okay.

I screamed as loud as one can when fear is choking them and I ran. I bolted on to the grass, and as he comes down with me I somehow end up on my back. My first thought is of the pepper spray I usually keep in my purse front pocket, and I delve my hand inside—which is difficult as he is utilizing the time my hands are preoccupied to beat my face. I realize the spray isn’t there and my heart sinks. He has my legs mostly pinned, and I’m thrashing for all I’m worth. I start to feel his hands moving underneath my dress, pulling it up, grabbing my ass, and I notice he’s not trying to move me to the car anymore. I can feel his body pressing heavier against me. Fear flashes through me as I realize where this is going. My nails find his face of their own accord

As quickly as he had been on me, and smiled before getting in. I leapt up and ran towards him—livid and confused and not willing to let him get away yet unsure how to proceed. I tend to be fairly well spoken, and I’m no stranger to insults, but at the time my outraged mind could only spit out “HEY!” before he sped off.

It’s weird but I didn’t cry until after I found a house and called the police—I had misplaced my phone in the shuffle and didn’t find it until later that night. I found out later that the house it happened in front of had people home

The cabinet door closes and a woman is standing there, mid to late twenties, and I distinctly remember her looking pretty and she had red-ish hair. She notices me looking and smiles at me, and stops rummaging through the cabinet. 

I had just gotten a puppy who was very fluffy and adorable- and social. When she stopped, and then I ask: ""Are you one of my mom's friends?"" because sometimes they babysat my siblings and I. 

She responds no, and notice at the steps of the door she was using to leave were several bottles of different alcoholic drinks. I thought that was weird, but since I rarely went into the cabinet, I didn't recognize the bottles as ours. 

I thought that was weird, trying not to freak out, I think. I didn't tell her the lady took anything because I didn't know that stuff was ours. She asks how she got in, and I tell my mom that I think she got in through our garage door because that's how she left. I mention she had some alcohol bottles with her. My mom (which, to me at the time, was acting weird) tells me with a serious/freaked out look on her face to lock the garage door next time and don't let strangers in, etc. (she knew I didn't let the lady in

Later, and they said no, so she came into our house to get her fix. 

A year or so later

Tl;dr: Lady walks into my house while it's unlocked and I'm home alone and 9 years old, says no, takes the alcohol, leaves. Turns out she's the neighbor's alcoholic daughter.

1366420819.0,1cpq82,Roommate Video Taping Me,oliviabloom,305,36,32,"To clarify:  I'm a female and I was 20 when this occurred.  


When I was a junior in college, so I looked at Craigslist ads renting out rooms and found a place near my school.  I met up with the guy renting out the room and the house was large, beautiful, and in a very nice neighborhood.  Peter, the man who owned the home, was in his early thirties, worked mostly from home in his bedroom office



For my first week, a television and our own personal bedroom furniture.  There were two entire bedrooms that were completely empty and a locked, empty upstairs that you could only access from an outdoor staircase directly outside of my bedroom.  The house had several additions, so the lay out was odd.  My bedroom was very spacious and had visible wiring throughout the room and the closet, which had a broken door that was propped to the side.  Peter told me the previous owners used it as an office and the internet wires once ran through my room up into the upstairs.  I checked the wires because it gave me a bad feeling but didn't find anything suspicious, mostly because I had no idea what to look for.



Once Peter returned, such as me sitting on the couch with a friend or me typing on my laptop at the new kitchen table.  He would turn the flash off so I never knew he was taking these pictures until later when I saw them on the internet.  The pictures became more invasive with time; one was of me in a towel when I was walking from my bathroom to my bedroom and another was of me tanning in my backyard at a time I didn't know he was home.



I found Peter strange and uncomfortable, and the hallway that led to the living room.  The thermostat was located in my bedroom near my closet so I always left the door unlocked for him to change it if needed.  One day Peter was out of town and the third roommate was changing the thermostat and noticed something strange behind one of the wires coiled in the closet.  He called me over to inspect it and it looked like a tiny, shiny black ball.  I was really afraid it was a camera and put a piece of duct tape over the ball.  I considered saying something to Peter but didn't want to accuse him of something I really knew nothing about.  He also wasn't home yet so me and the third roommate decided we would ask him about together when he was home.



Peter returned to town two nights later, disoriented, and noticed the door was open with a small rectangle of light spilling in and someone was moving inside my room.  I stayed very still and tried to make out the figure, which was staying near my closet, directly across from my bed. My eyes were having difficulty adjusting to the darkness, but I could clearly see a person slowly moving throughout my bedroom.  The figure left and I turned the light on and inspected my closet to see that the piece of tape was missing and not anywhere on the floor, like it had fallen.  I opened my door and saw Peter walking down the hallway, and when he walked into his room I followed him in and demanded to know what the hell he was doing in my bedroom in the middle of the night.



When I confronted Peter, on the desktop he was always hunched over doing his work, was a grainy video image of my bedroom, faltering in the dim lamp light I had just turned on.  I could clearly see my bed in the frame.  Although Peter was a creepy man, he wasn't confrontational and he immediately began apologizing and trying to explain it wasn't what it looked like.



I don't have the best closing for this experience.  I contacted the police and immediately moved in with someone I met at school.  I don't want to disclose anything about the investigation because charges were pressed, I hope I never know.

He had a lady friend named Mary living in a big city, she was a beautiful girl that made poor dating decisions and was often attracted to assholes. 

One day Mary had enough with one of her longer term asshole boyfriends, begging to be heard out, banging at it, and demanding she let him in. For some reason, I guess he sounded pathetic enough for Mary to feel bad, and she opened that door, but when she refused to give him a second chance he flew into a rage, grabbed her by the hair and started beating her. There was nothing she could do

Then something happened that neither of them could have ever expected. About six minutes into her having the life beaten out of her, and proceeded to give him a taste of his own medicine, holding him by the hair and feeding him fist after fist until finally the ex twisted free and hauled his ass out of there, yelping threats as he retreated off down the hall and stairs. 

Mary had told my dad that the man was pretty tall with lank hair and a strangely emotionless look about him, like a deer caught in the headlights. She was crying but still managed to thank him and ask him if he had heard her yelling. He shook his head and plainly said ""I can see you in the windows."" And then just as quickly as he came, he left, and she never saw him again.

One night, and the bright lights in the hall bothered me. It wasn't my normal male nurse, but an older woman, maybe mid-to-late 40's. I had never seen her before, and she looked very severe. She didn't acknowledge me at all when I greeted her, and asked her questions, just finally said ""time for your medication"" or something like that.


I tried to respect that she didn't want to talk and just faced forward again, but this thing was huge, like a 100-500 cc syring, and the accuracy couldn't be that good, so I turned my head again and asked (trying to sound friendly and interested) what my dosage was and if she was sure she had the right person. She ignored me, and I continued""…because I think maybe normally my dosage is a lot lower, would you mind double-checking..."" She only said ""Go to sleep, injected the medication, and forcing the issue


So after a time - I don't really know how much time - I start to feel more genuinely, hot on the outside, like I'm radiating heat from the surface of my skin everywhere, but cold on the inside of my skin. Around then I started to notice that everything had turned a shade of red and it was all pulsing, with what I imagine was my heartbeat. So I'm staring at the ceiling, in the dim, and everything I can see is through this red filter, I lose all sensation in my skin. I can still feel pressure, if I was actually seeing or thinking I was seeing. When all sensation finally left me I felt like I was floating about 5"" off of the surface of the bed. 

I realize, for which I am later grateful. But nothing feels emergent, the whole thing comes with a warm fuzziness, so I spend a lot of time just playing with trying to move my hands or arms, watching them before realizing I'm not actually looking at them, but nonetheless gradually losing my ability to move anything at all. Around the time I can only barely move my wrists, not my arms or fingers (and my legs are a foreign country) I start to feel concern.
I realize, and that this actually has the potential to be very dangerous. I want to hit the button again, or even call out, but I am just too tired, my muscles wont move, and now I notice that the pulsing isn't as frequent as it was, though it was only upon reflection later on that I fully realized the significance of that. So I kind of mentally slapped myself and set about consciously focusing on breathing - in and out, and don't forget in - that's the hard part. 

It felt like the nurses never responded, it seemed like a lot of things happened all at once. There had been this growing tension in me. If I could have flexed every muscle in my body I would have been, I was fighting something very hard. And then my nurse came in - my male nurse, whom I had thought was out for the night. The moment I hear the door open coincides with a sudden release of all of the heavy mass that had settled over me, like a soft heavy blanket that wouldn’t let me move. And I suddenly sat up and projectile vomited in to the bathroom, next to the nurse who was just walking in. (Sorry, I know it’s gross, I could even speak after a few minutes.


My nurse seemed relieved to say the least. He cleaned it up and sat next to me and talked for a while. He said that another nurse had been trying to help him, I had been out of it for days, clearly in visible pain for some of it, I was the youngest person there by 40 years or so. I wonder if it was just a mistake, or if that woman was an angel of death? Either way, I refused morphine for the rest of my time there and ever since.

""Hi. I was taken back by how beautiful you are in your picture. I hope you don't find that too forward. I saw you post on *insert local companies name here* wall and I thought your comment was funny. I couldn't resist clicking on your profile and messaging you. Your sense of humor is just like mine

Now, but I felt bad for the guy. I thanked him and told him I was sorry for his loss, and that I was glad that I made him laugh...but once he sent me a friend request I had to let him know I didn't have any intention of adding him as I only use facebook for people I know. He said he understood and we said our good-byes. 

So one day about a week after his initial message I was out shopping at the local grocery store nearby my home and I noticed a guy looking at me from a few feet away in the aisle I was in. I looked and smiled nervously as I'm somewhat shy and socially awkward and he smiled back and then looked at what was in front of him. He looked familiar

""I liked the dress you wore today. It fit your body nicely. thanks for smiling at me...made me feel special."" 

I didn't realize it was him at the store

I chose not to reply just to be safe. About another week goes by and I haven't heard from him again. I was out with some friends at night at a park just hanging out on the swings like we did when we were teenagers when I noticed someone in the distance. They were walking towards the park... my friends and I got kinda spooked and went quiet. I realized when the person was close enough that it was Peter. I tell my friends in a quiet voice ""don't panic...act natural...but we need to leave now. Get in the car."" They didn't argue and we all got in the car and drove away....Peter was gone. 

I told my friends who it was and what had been going on. They told me I was just being paranoid. 

Then I got a message on facebook again...it was from him. 

""So do you go to the park often?"" 

I noped the fuck out....and replied with this: 

""Do not message me ever again. My boyfriend is aware of the situation and he is a police officer. Leave me alone."" 

I blocked him...and even though I made up the boyfriend thing to scare him...it must have worked because I haven't heard from him or seen him again in months. I live with 3 people who all know what he looks like and know about the situation so they keep a look out and nothing suspicious has happened... but...that doesn't mean I don't look over my shoulder every now and then.

1342075367.0,wfif1,Just because it's light out doesn't mean you're safe.,morganshea,297,32,27,"This is my first post

I was 21-years-old, which was entirely deserted, and parked my car right next to the curb - as close to the park as I could get. June in Arizona is brutal, heat-wise, so I had every intention of making this process a short one. I left the trunk open and my keys in the ignition with the car on to keep the AC running. The gates to the ballpark were padlocked and chained shut, so I set up my camera and tripod right outside the box office to get set-up footage.

I had been there for about 10 minutes when a silver pick-up pulled into the lot and parked perpendicularly in front of my car, the entire lot was empty and this guy parked about 2 feet away from my car. My assumptions were confirmed in the next few minutes.

The guy got out of his beat up double cab pick-up, the guy was about 6'3"" and heavyset with white hair and glasses. Probably in his 50's, he wore a dull yellow baseball cap, a filthy blue shirt and blue sweat pants. Looked like he hadn't showered or changed clothes in weeks. His face was genuinely disturbing. To this day I can't accurately describe the feeling I got from the expression on his face - a twisted semi-grin, but his eyes looked menacing, like he had a screw loose. He walked with intent - with one hand in his pocket as he headed for where I stood, I could feel his eyes burning into me. No exaggeration

As he approached me, never taking his eyes off me, still moving closer. I'll never forget how that stare felt. I was so scared at that exact moment. I knew he was trying to talk to me in some attempt to distract my attention from what I already knew. I didn't respond, so he asked again. I replied with a quick no, picked up my phone, and answered like I was receiving a call. He just stood there. Still staring.

I spoke loudly to ensure the man heard what I was saying. ""Hey are you almost here? Oh, the guy slowly ambled away from me, heading toward the ballpark gates. The entire time, he did not once take his eyes off of me. Not once. He was glaring - it felt like he was angry with me. He looked furious.

I took notice that it was still just he and I in that lot, I picked up my equipment and ran to my car. He followed. I was frantically attempting to repack my car, throwing my equipment into the trunk without even bothering to shut it. I was literally running back to the driver's side door when he met me there. The guy's car was still on and his doors were still open. He reached out to grab me. At that exact second, I ducked into the driver's seat and without closing the door, threw my car into reverse, slamming on the accelerator. 

I was bawling at this point. I flew out of the parking lot and drove away. I knew I had to call the police, the truck came barreling toward my car. He then followed me.

I drove directly to the campus police station in Tempe - he drove past it. I didn't get his license plate number

We started visiting the house at night and noticed a car parked out front of our house. It was strange
Fast forward a few months and our house is built. The house is empty and we are slowly moving everything in during the first week. As for the mysterious car, we are the only house on the block. This was a brand new development and we were literally the first house built, so we were just this lonesome house in the middle of the desert, a few blocks away from the nearest neighborhood. My wife demands we buy a security system, so I do (she spent many nights alone since I worked late at night). 

It's my day off and I spend it organizing stuff from the moving boxes and hanging out with my 6 month old son. My wife is at work. I realize that there are no diapers or wipes

A few hours later, but she is moving slowly... I thought it was weird but figured she knew we were sleeping and didn't want to wake us. My back is facing the door to my bedroom and I hear her open the door. I get into my ""pretend sleep mode"" and stay still. I hear a quick breath of air, as if she was startled to see us sleeping. No other noise is made and I assume she is just standing there... I think to myself ""Ok... Go away now..."" but it takes a full minute or two before I hear her slowly tip toeing out of my room, downstairs, and then leaving the house.

One evening she asked if I wanted to come over to watch a movie on  her crappy 12in TV. Knowing it meant being cuddly on a bed

The movie had ended and curfew was quickly approaching. Due to the dorms policies on boys after 11

""Over the past two nights, Im not really sure how long he's been there. And he talks. Repeats. Keeps asking if Im sleeping and if he can come in. So far Ive said nothing. I just lie here with the blankets up to my chin. This goes one for about an hour and then he just stops, and is gone. I finally asked my neighbors today if they had heard any thing or had a similar experience. They said no.""

Now this is college. I wasn't too worried. There could be any number of explanations. Most likely a prank, and exterior doors locked after 11. It had to be a prank, but to console my upset friend, I agreed to stay the night incase the events were to reoccur. 

Much to my dismay, I'd just cowboy up, tell the guy off, then hopefully spend the rest of the night next to a grateful warm body beneath neon purple bed sheets.

I was in deep sleep when a slight tap on my shoulder abruptly awoke me. It took a moment to remember were I was and regain my equilibrium, almost gentle. It paused after about every four or five beats. The only light in the room was the light coming from under the door in the hallway with the exception the two shadows made by the individuals feet.

I looked to my friend not sure how long she had been awake. As her face came in focus I began to register her terror. That was the first time this whole thing had actually started to get to me. Then

""Are you sleeping sweetly? Sweetly are you sleeping? Can I come in? Let me in.""

A cold shot up my spine. His voice was soft yet rough, almost muffling them. I quietly stood up, and slowly approached the door.I stopped at it to get a better listen. He kept repeating a variation of the same words, sleeping and sweetly, sometimes even mixing up parts of the words like, ""Are you sweeping sleetly"". This slurred dialect lead me to believe that perhaps this was a drunk, who somehow consecutively stumbled his way into the dorm, I took down a warm gulp of air
""Hey Guy, the shadows of his feet still remained. It was probably only a few seconds but it seemed like a lot longer. Then, one by one the shadows disappeared as he walked away. 

I let out a sigh of relief then looked back to my friend. Seeing that grateful smile and teary eyes made me feel like a badass. It apparently made me walk like a badass too as I noticed I had a bit of a strut as I walked back to her side. As I prepared to return to the floor

I popped up with a mixed fuel of fear and anger. The shadows had also returned. This jerk just made me go from badass to punkass in less then two minutes. I jumped up rushing the door shouting as I stomped ""Hey man

After a beat

My friend let out a ""Crap!"" then jumped up to answer the door. She put on a pair of pajama pants that were under the covers. I grit my teeth in disappointment realizing she had at some point in the ordeal slipped them off. She ran up beside me then opened the door.

""Sorry."" She said to the R.A., there was this guy who…"" The R.A. interrupted her. ""Under no circumstances should a boy stay over night in the dorm. Nor should you sit helplessly in a dangerous situation. Were  someone to actually come to your or any other girls door at night, you should dial 4 on your phone for campus security, or repot the incident to me. You've been the only one we had to visit multiple times. Now get that guy out of here.""

It turns out the whole thing was some R.A.s idea of teaching the girls a valuable lesson, but she was doing this bizarre lesson without the knowledge of the school.

Later my friend filed a complaint and the R.A. was relieved of her duties. To anser the question on everybody's mind

We go in, beer after beer, and she starts hitting on all of these guys. I forgot to mention that Wendy has been in a relationship for over 8 years, but when she gets drunk, she's out of control.

A few minutes pass, then figure she's joking. She forgets about it really fast, and we spend the night dancing. Mallorie and Lisa come back down, and the night goes on without any problems.

It's about 3am. We're all tired. The club is about to close. Lisa, heaving their guts. Completely shit-faced. I walk outside to get some fresh air, when my phone rings. I hear Wendy calling for me, so I answer my phone without paying attention to the number.

""Your friend gave me your number."" The voice is low and garbled. In the pit of my stomach I feel uneasy

I immediately get a terrible feeling. I am instantly terrified of this man. There is nothing unusual about him. White

I ask who hes with, because I don't think we have an appointment. I pick up the baby and go down the hall to the kitchen where I call the mother. I stand where I can still see the door. 

She tells me that the gas company isn't supposed to be there... she tells me that shes going to call them just to make sure. I hang up and go back to the door to talk to the man again. I didn't want to be rude. I'm holding the baby still

He starts yelling at me that he is supposed to be there. Hes saying its cold out

The mother calls back, but no house in her neighborhood. Shes called the police and is calling her neighbors. Shes on her way home with the father. 

I'm pissed. Not only is this guy not with the gas company but hes being a dick and freaking me out. I puff myself up and go back to the door. I look out the window

I later learned the same guy was going around to other neighbors and ""inspecting"" gas mains in the houses. It was suspected that he was casing houses to break into. I've always been a little freaked out over what could have happened if I let him.

TL;DR: Man pretending to be from gas company shows up while I'm babysitting, parents call over neighbor. He was apparently casing houses in the neighborhood.

I was living in an apartment in an inner city.  The city had a lot of sex offenders living in it and I knew this.  I was living on the second floor.  It was summer vacation and I was home alone with my sister.  I got a knock on the back door and I thought it was another tenant since the person would have had to get into the building to knock directly on my back door.  I open the door and I see an overweight, not entered the building, and would have been wearing a badge.  I tell him to go away and slam the door in his face and I locked it.  This happened at about 12pm.

At 5pm my mother called to tell me that she would be running late coming home.  I took the opportunity to tell her about the creepy guy that came to the house.  At that moment

I suppose I should start off saying I am a 20 year old women. 
I live in a college dorm room- it is built in a triangular shape meaning if I look out of my window I can see other people in their rooms. My side of the building is slightly taller than the other side

I sometimes sit on my desk next to the window to have a smoke

Anyway, meaning no matter when I smoke- he seems to be there.

For the last month or so we have been kinda like smoking buddies, we awkwardly wave at each other while I smoke, then I go back to my reddit recluse on my bed where no one can see me. I always thought this was coincidence, however now I think he might have been looking out his window at me.

This morning- about half an hour ago in fact- he seemed really into waving


He was wearing just a tee shirt and I was pulling a 'its cold face' so that if it was awkward I could blame the cold and make a hasty retreat

He seemed pretty normal and nice

It's pretty normal for people to casually hang out in their rooms


 I went upstairs with him to his room. when we were walking up the stairs I started to feel a bit like 'a lamb to the slaughter' because he was brushing close to me in a way that is not necessary- there was plenty of room on the steps. 

I took note of this feeling
He had not done anything wrong

We got to his room
He offered me a seat on his bed (another norm here
 He seemed a bit shaky, a lot of students drink, and after all he has been waving very nicely at me for a while now.

We talked about religion (I hinted I was a strict christian, and I thought 'my instincts must be wrong, a strict Muslim wouldn't make a move on a girl they barely know.) 

He asked if I had a boyfriend, because I am awful at rejecting people who ask me out.
 
He moved on to the bed to offer me a lighter, like I said, we are students. Hanging out in our dorms on our beds is what we do. 


We talked about things for a little while, as that coupled with the way he looked me up and down like meat made me feel somewhat like he was thinking 'hmm white girls are easy'. I'm sorry if this sounds racist- round here there is a general misconception that white girls are all slutty and up for it. 
Then he mentions that he has been looking at me for almsot 5 months now, seeing further in to my room than I ever thought he could.  I starts to sound like  a stalker, he mentions seeing my bum... I dont parade  in front of my window naked and I would need to be in front of my window for him to see me. I realize he has been watching me.

 I made a joke to move the subject on
He laughed
 touching
 my 
face.

Like

I moved his hand away and laughed it off. Social etiquette means I cannot leave without saying goodbye first

I say no and try to pull away but he keeps going for it. 'No' obviously means nothing to this guy

I think : fuck this, nice meet you though, sorry so busy!' like the fucking polite following-social-etiquette-even-when-no-one-else-is douche canoe I am. 

I get out, up my stairs and in my fucking apartment with all the doors locked. 

I think I managed to close my curtain without him seeing. 

I am only realizing now my arm really hurts. My mind automatically blanks horrible experiences from my mind and I have a bad memory anyway


I have three or four days left living opposite this guy. Fuck.

**TL;DR:** talked to the guy who has been waving at me from his bedroom for the last month or so, meaning he must have been looking from other angles.

I was about 11 or 12 and living in upstate NY. I had made friends with a girl in my class, you know how laughable that is.) We'd often hang out at my house, where there was plenty of healthy snacks and I had cable, but one day I was invited to a sleepover at her place. I packed a bag and headed over after school. Stacy's mom (who didn't have it going on) had friends over, and they were drinking shitty wine and generally acting like douchebags before they headed out to the bar to get more trashed. They went out to have a cigarette, except for one guy. I can't remember his name, but he was about thirty, lean
""You're very pretty
I was pudgy and never wore makeup, and being a dumb kid I told him so. He smiled at me. ""I'll be your boyfriend. Want some wine? How about a cigarette? I bet you look hot when you smoke.""                                        
Stacy got up and left. I tried to follow her but he still had a firm grip on my arm. With his other hand he caressed the inside of my thigh and moved upward. I froze, and all I knew was that this was wrong and terrifying. He slipped his hand inside my pants and I managed to tear my arm away and run upstairs. I locked myself in the bathroom until I heard them leave, then got to the phone and called my dad. I didn't tell him what happened. I cried for almost two days until he finally coaxed it out of me. He was livid. I was forbidden from ever going to Stacy's again. My mom lived near NYC and we called her. She drove the four hours that night and together we went to the police.                         
The police in my town are notoriously lazy. They took my statement, two girls I'd never talked to, Ashley and Desiree, sat at my table. They told me that he did the same thing to Desiree when she had a sleepover with Stacy. Ashley had agreed to be his girlfriend (she was and still is astoundingly stupid) and he had forcibly taken her virginity, which her parents reported to the police, hence him being ""not unknown.""

1374901582.0,1j598q,Poker Face,awriternamedwilliams,301,49,130,"This happened in Antioch
It was around 2AM.

I was at a friend’s house
We were having a lot to drink, when you’re having fun, time hits the fast forward button, and those few minutes turn into an hour.  
I had too much to drink. 

My friend has a bit of an abrupt bed time

Whatever. Sometimes a little inconvenience makes you appreciate everything else.
I needed about another hour or so to sober up and drive back.

As fast as time passed during my stay, my car was parked; the only street light that worked was in the middle of the cul-de-sac's circle, about 80 yards away. I stumbled towards my car, produced my keys, felt the metal line up, opened my door and shifted to the back seat. Because this was a dark, strange and unfamiliar neighborhood

I was a little scared

I couldn't fall asleep. The uncomfortable feeling of a cheap backseat bed enshrouded in darkness didn't make the chance of slumber easier, like how the police would shine their lights on me through the window, or a drunk driver hitting my car, and….

...wait...
 
...in the distance, growing in proximity, but periodically taking stops. 

I wondered why until it made sense in my mind: whoever it was was probably looking through cars carefully, breathing. 

I froze. 

There was no more than one foot between us. The car encapsulated me as I lay hidden beneath backseat clutter, unmoving and simply not there.

""I seeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuu""

Said a 40+ year old man in perverse baby talk.

Imagine when you were playing hide and seek, like he was questioning whether the clutter in backseat was just clutter.... or a person.

I didn't want to move or check the window. 
I remained clutter. 
Give me an academy award.

My body reacted by minimizing my breathing so much that I felt paralyzed. I dare not look. My eyes fixated on the back of the passenger seat. I didn't blink

He circled around the car, as if to test the alarm, as if to test me.

I was in the middle of fight or flight. I couldn't do either without elevating danger.  I was frozen and hoping to God he was bluffing.

He circled the car again. The door handle to my right jiggled. He was pulling it multiple times.

""I seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuu"" 

Same tone, revealing itself to be of his expectations that it was me.

My muscles tensed like a cow before slaughter.

*Tap tap tap*

That had to be metal against glass.
Take a penny right now and tap your window.

A crow bar? A knife? A rock? A gun? My eyes fixated on the seat in front of me

""My name is poker face. What's your name?""

The voice changed
My mind forced a visual

I already accepted my death. I was ready to be shot in the head, not excruciating, as you drain me of life.

I wouldn't know how to react

It was then I heard nothing but my own heart. What was this person doing now? Just staring at me in the middle of the night? Talking to me

Time froze. The footsteps were being swallowed in the distance. Thank God he left. I waited another hour until the sun showed hints of itself. I jumped in my front seat and bolted out of there



**TL;DR** - Tried to sleep in the backseat of my car at 3AM. I was hidden underneath clothes, talking to me.

To preface I'm a female.  So Lake Hodges is in Rancho Bernardo which is in San Diego

30 minutes into my hike

I told him I wasn't sure and we played the name-game.  Quick background info: my parents never let me go hiking/walking

I asked him what he was doing at the lake and he told me he was looking for new spots for his Hash run group (where you drink and run, I agreed to smoke a bowl with him and led him up the hill to my favorite spot where we could sit on a bench overlooking the neighborhood.  

We spend about 30 minutes trying to figure out exactly how we knew each other and we narrowed it down to a specific group of guys I hung out with in middle-school but drifted away from in high school because of drugs.  Again, my parent's were home waiting for me (it was the weekend and I was going to go out to dinner with the family) and tidbits of information about my relationship as I was texting my BF every so often.  

As we walked down the mountain and onto the street, John was arrested for the rape and murder of Chelsea King.  He confessed to Amber's murder when they offered up a life-sentence instead of the death penalty.  He took it and plead guilty.  When I heard I found the piece of paper with his name and number on it and drove to my boyfriend's house as fast as I could to tell him the story.  No reason to bring up a casual encounter previously as I no longer talk to those mutual friends and like I said, I had no intention of actually ever getting in contact with him again.  

I'm not sure if it was my demeanor (when I'm alone I stand taller, that my folks were home expecting me to return, that the dog wasn't mine so again, someone was expecting me to return the dog or maybe I just wasn't his ""type,"" but he tried no such maneuvers with me.  My first thought was that we knew too many mutual friends, but I later heard that Chelsea King was best friends with John's best friend's sister.  Either way, I was thoroughly  freaked for a good month.  The only people I told were my boyfriend and brother because I know my parents would have flipped.

So, right on Lake Huron. The estate had a four bedroom manor that was built in the 1800's, a groundskeeper hut, a large warehouse type barn, another building that housed cattle, and two smaller sheds that we used for outdoor storage. The barns were in a state of neglect - structurally they were sound, but they had all the fixings of creepy buildings: crackling white paint on the inside, etc. The house itself looked exactly like the house from the Amytiville horror series (the interior resembled the house from the Others

The entire estate itself sat on about 15 acres, and then the shoreline to the lake. We had no neighbors, and were the only property in a 4 mile radius. 

Anyway,500 residents total) and incredibly safe so there wasn't really a problem with trust. Our family dog, a giant purebred siberian husky named Sheeba, was always around. I was used to being home alone before and usually relished the privacy, but after that Saturday I refused to ever stay alone.

Most of the day on Saturday I spent at my friend Leigh Ann's house. Around 8PM I decided to head home and make myself some dinner. The kitchen was toward the back of the house, since we were so isolated). I was standing at the stove stirring a pot of noodles when I saw something flicker out of my peripheral vision. I walked over to the window, and sure enough, I saw what looked like the faint glow of a lantern or something coming from the tiny window of the caretaker's hut. I'm not sure what I thought, since I dismissed it being some kids exploring, but nonetheless I grabbed a flashlight and Sheeba and I walked out to the hut. Opened the door, and there was one of those giant flood lights turned on

It's a little less than a quarter mile walk from the caretaker's hut to my house, so I wasn't in a hurry. I was crouching down playing with my dog when I saw something that I'll never, ever, ever forget.

I saw the kitchen light come on in the house. Then I saw the bathroom light come on. Then, and then the two bedroom lights that faced my way turn on. What. the. fuck. I know I have to go in the house and check it out, but that's not what I particularly wanted to do at the moment. My phone was in the house charging. At that point, I did what any other 16 year old would do: I walked into the barn, grabbed an old farmer's scythe from the wall, and slowly walked up to the house with Sheeba by my side. Before I went anywhere near the door, I decided that someone was either robbing us, I felt like I wanted to take the upper hand in the situation. The circuit breaker for the entire house was located in the barn next to it. I cut the power

Sheeba instantly bolted off from the kitchen into the lower part of the house, then growling. I heard some weird shifting noises, which I blamed the dog for. I was about to start walking through my house, when Sheeba came running back into the kitchen right past me, knocking open the loose screen door and running off into the night. Again, my 16 year old fearless mind thought she just caught the scent of a fox or something, and ran off after it. I wasn't really worried since she would run off all the time and come back fifteen minutes later (again

I check out the lower part of the house, looking for who knows what, when I heard a crash upstairs. You know that moment when you think you see/hear something scary, and you just play it off? That was what I was feeling RIGHT before I heard that. I decided I had looked for enough trouble that night, grabbed my phone and ran outside. I was walking down the end of my driveway, about to open the door to my jeep, when all the lights in my house went back on. Someone had turned the circuit breaker back on in the shed, from across the estate

At this point I should've called the cops, over to the barn with the breaker box. Nobody was there. The only thing out of place was that my step-dad's mini fridge, which he kept out there when he was working, was wide open. I closed the fridge door.

I called Leigh Ann and told her what was going on and started to walk back to the house when I saw whatever was messing me. A tall figure was just standing in the middle of our circular driveway, and they were tall and lanky.

Leigh Ann told me she was coming over, but they were enough to leave us in a really unsettled mood.

1. My mom used one of the rooms as a guest room, with each doll's gaze pointed straight at the bed. On the bed itself were two dolls placed in a crude sexual position.

2. The upstairs bathroom had one of those old fashioned deep tubs. The shower curtain was pulled off the rings, and then left. 

3. The last, but in the midst of everything going on that was the last thing I wanted to do.

After securing the house and locking all the doors, but nothing. Sheeba came back four days after she ran off, which is the longest she's ever been gone. The incident didn't really traumatize me as much as you think, but I did watch my step around the house at night and looked at my small town in a different view.

The person never came back to my knowledge. There were some nights

I haven't been back to the house since 2008, all staring at it.

 I was somewhere between 11-12 years old. My mom had just moved

 back to her hometown of Kooskia Idaho

 population of approximately 654. She came across a little cafe called 

the Idaho Back-Roads

wandered in and discovered the place was still owned by friends of

 hers from years back. They were an older couple

up on their retirement age. They were eager to sell

my mom was the proud owner of a quaint little cafe. We spruced the

 place up( it had minor wear and tear those older people couldn't 

routinely take care of) and reopened in the summer of 05.

It was a mom and pop sort of place

Cafe

Idaho. Kooskia is pretty much the last stop on Highway 95 if you're 

heading out to Missoula

in between

and summer months. When my mother bought the Back-Roads

often ran into touring elderly people, and 

bikers. Our food was decently priced

tasted like home. Well

 we scraped by until the next season. As a 12 year old girl might

incredibly generous. I saved my tips for various things a child wants

 but mainly I stashed the money away to help pay for school supplies.

 My mother raised us to be able to take care of ourselves

wary. As I walked by with an armful of dirty dishes

 shoulder and told me to go take a break. We weren't particularly 

busy at the time

 break so early in the day. I started to politely protest, that you just don't argue with. 
So I shrugged, 

hung up my apron and went outside to check on Reggie. When I 

walked outside

 the gate

reached out to scratch her ears

 she took this almost stoically

apartment like she wanted to come inside. I could not do that during

 business hours

on the threshold of the kitchen to keep her from trotting around. I 

talked to her for a minute or too

 let out a whimpering growl

 me. I shushed her and told her to stay put

 obeyed the command. Being a clever dog
 the gate herself. 

But since she had done this in the past

around the gate latch with a padlock

 she didn't have thumbs to turn a key. I closed the door and she let 

out a pained howl
o anger my mother by letting Reggie roam free in our eatery

firmly closed the door and made my way outside. 15 minutes was long

 enough of a break

 As I approached the kitchen

threshold

extremely tense. This was completely abnormal

 hippy type

saw the man from earlier standing in the middle of the seating area 

screaming at my sister. He was red-faced and completely belligerent, as he loomed over my 13 year old sister. In a flash my mom was in between them, losing her calm establishment owner look. She had replaced this look seamlessly with the angry mother bear stance. Jasper, and our older sibling Taleah joined her as well, a wall of flesh blocking Seanna from danger. I watched, terrified, in silence. Taleah was an intimidating 16 year old, and her fellow officers for defense training practice. 
She also played a variety of sports, making absolutely no sense as to what he was so angry about. Quickly my mother subdued the gentleman, twisting his arm around behind his back, and marched him outside, pushing him across the street, to the gas station parking lot. He took a swing at her when she let go of his arm, and she subdued him yet again. I was scared for this man, for even attempting at hurting my mom. If she lost her temper with him
He waved his hands in surrender, pretending to still be on my break. She came in, looking incredibly calm. She scanned the apartment reflexively, her danger bells still going off. 
""Lyssa, but from my mother. These were two different people. I jumped up immediately and came out. Taleah and Jasper stood together, looking ashen, and drawn. Seanna was just barely calmed from hysterics. This is not an easy thing for her, she doesn't have the same temperament as my mother, Taleah and I. She's a very timid individual. 
We turned the signs, and my mom hung a sign on the door saying "" Out until 5pm"" Everyone went about their jobs in silence, save for the radio playing. It was an eerie calm. Mom sat in the corner booth with my sister, who's sobs had died down to hiccups, as she explained the situation. It turns out, she had gone to take his order, and hadn't heard something he'd said. She'd politely begged his pardon and asked if he would please repeat what he'd said. He just went ballistic from there, then just stood there screeching at her. 
We all calmed ourselves eventually, you can see the whole stretch of Main Street, from beginning to end. I tugged on my mothers sleeve as she walked by me, and she turned to look out the window where I pointed. She stiffened, as he approached the building. He didn't come in, he simply walked by. But, he turned around immediately, and looked at her. She froze, with a significant gesture at my sister. My mother called the police immediately. The deputy( Carlos) responded
We didn't see him again for the remainder of business hours, and we went about our business with cleaning up shutting down shop. At night, before we went to bed, one of us always had to take the dog on ""patrol"" as we called it. We would walk with Reggie through the entire restaurant, opening every door so she could look in. 
And I mean it when I say she insisted on checking out everything. We'd start in the apartment, in the bathroom stalls, hallways, and the entire front lobby of the establishment. When she was satisfied with her inspection, she'd lay by the door to the apartment, and we'd reward her effort with a piece of deli meat or the occasional hamburger patty if we had one leftover. Then, she'd pad off to the apartment and resume normal dog activity. We all went to bed around 10:30-11pm that night. 
My mom and I shared a bed, we left the doors open, and latched the screen door. One at the top, and one at the bottom. The top was a hook, and the bottom as a slide latch. Like I said earlier, Reggie was a very clever dog, and could figure out how to work things fast
We all quickly went to sleep, and she slept like a rock. Everything was fine, but I'd woken a couple times, to Reggie, letting out a hair raising low growl of warning. I figured a cat was outside, and she did not get along with them, so she was scaring them away from our door. I went back to sleep. What seemed to me like just minutes later, fur standing on end. 
I got up, and the room was dark. Taleah took a step away from her bed, and Reggie went ballistic, all in that same moment as I sat watching from my bed, confused. She let out a snarl that chills me to this day, fangs bared. I had never seen Reggie act this way before, she was always docile and gentle. Taleah calmly approaches her,
""Reggie, I hear a man curse under his breath,
""Shit!""as if frustrated by the progress of something. Reggie no longer holds back, snarling, and emanating noises that sounded like someone loosed Cerberus the Hellhound in our living space. She ripped through the screen in her rage, forcing her upper half through the mesh like it was paper. Now I heard him clearly, cursing and screaming at our dog. Everyone was awake now, scrambling for lights, and yelling at each other in confusion. Reg was caught by the midsection in the screen, like a beartrap on bone
This set our docile family pet into a frothing frenzy. She would kill him, kicking it open, and simultaneously cocking her pistol and taking aim. Somehow, she'd managed to grab Reggie's collar, and yank her back, and pass her off to my sister, who dragged her into the hallway and locked the door. I heard Reggie's outraged howl come immediately after Taleah locked her in, and Mom closed both apartment doors
In the morning light, had dropped it on the Welcome mat. He'd been trying to jimmy the pin from the screens hinges out of the hinging mechanism, and that sound was what alerted the dog. The police canvassed the neighborhood in the early light, and found a trail of blood from our backdoor heading a couple blocks West until it slowly grew to nothing. 
Police speculated the man was in a crouching position when Reggie busted through the screen door, I'm sure we wouldn't be alive to this day. Sadly, when my sister married, she took Reggie with her to live out of town. She got out one day, and a hunter mistook her for an actual wild wolf, and shot her illegally. She was one of the best dogs we've ever had, and I owe her my life. I only wish she would have lived a happy full life she deserved, we love you! ",t5_2t3t8,True

One morning when Dad was getting ready for work and Mom got my older sister ready for school, figuring if the guy was violent he would have started some shit instead of running away. He advised Mom to keep the curtains closed over the window for the day and to stay home with the door locked until he got home later, in case the guy came back. My Mom didn't want my Dad to leave but Dad reminded her that he had to or else he wouldn't get paid for the day, so Mom reluctantly agreed and sent Dad and sister on their way.

Later that afternoon, patting my back while I bawled for no reason when she glanced at the front window to see if there was anyone standing there. Sure enough, there was! My Mom freaked out, snatched me up from the couch (which caused me to cry harder than I already was. God, I was such a shitty baby!) and locked the three of us in the bathroom so she could call Dad at work and then locked herself in with us. My Dad skipped out of work and ran back home. 

When he got there, he just punched him in the head as soon as he got close enough.

A couple years back, and that she hadn't realized she was pregnant when she left. She was scared, because 

1) She didn't want to raise a kid alone - I later found out that she had already lost 3 children to CPS for abuse and neglect.

2) She was doubly scared that the child would be messed up and more work to raise

He was apparently desperate for a family, sitting in his own filth, in the dark, given a bottle every few hours, and little to no attention or stimulation otherwise. The house was almost literally a shack, with a huge open hole into the foundation (about 10' across, and 10' down, an active road on one side of the 30' yard

My uncle and his wife threw parties pretty much every night - drinking, and the police getting called ALL THE TIME. However, because the family's long and historied relationship with the police, he was not really held accountable for things. The cops watched him like a hawk - but they never got into serious trouble.

**The main story**

Well, he was in the passenger seat, holding the child in his lap. There was no car seat. Both were hammered, but my uncle had somehow gotten it into his head that because *she didn't have a license* that she would get in less trouble if they got caught. The first thing he did when he sobered up was to call our house in a panic, begging us to volunteer to take his son if CPS took him away, so that he'd still be able to be in his kid's life and not just lose him to the foster system. After much discussion, mom/stepdad said yes, followed by silent, had an issue with food. (we found out after much work that it was a nervous reflex

Uncle got visitation rights, usually in the company of a friend, and both would reek of alcohol. He played rough with his son, dropped him on his head (twice) despite my mom's desperate pleas to be more gentle, and repeatedly harassed my mother by following her in public at a distance to keep an eye on his kid (he didn't live in the area and had to drive out to do this). 

I was alone at home with the child one night, just staring at the house. I ran downstairs and locked the doors, both front and back, and kept the phone nearby. There'd been talks of my Uncle losing his right to visitation because of how he'd been treating my mom, and he'd threatened to send friends to the house to keep an eye out in his place. The truck left, and I told my mom when she got home. 

This sort of tension went on for months - including a particularly uncomfortable night when he and the friend came to a church event, filthy and smelling like stale beer) wouldn't stop staring at me/flirting/telling me I was very mature for my age - and he began showing up regularly with one friend over all the others. The big shock came when, early one morning, the caseworker - who had become somehow enamored with my uncle and didn't believe any of the stuff we told her - called, frantically apologizing. My uncle was on the news. He and the friend he'd been bringing over had just been arrested: apparently he'd kidnapped an older woman, stripped her, and had been keeping her as a sexslave at his house for several weeks, and they had offered her to him for money - he waited a week before reporting them, keeping her chained up in a backroom, and nothing like the cold and inhuman child that originally came to my mother's home - will be 4 years old in April.

**TLDR: My uncle brought his friend over to the house all the time to visit his child which we were fostering after the cops caught him and his ex-wife driving with the baby, and is now in prison, and I have an adopted baby brother who's going to have the most startling revelation ever one day that his blonde-hair and blue-eyes don't quite match up with his Korean mother's features.**",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/qyvhj/why_my_younger_brother_will_never_know_his_father/
1372806903.0,1hj3td,"The Scariest Sleepover of My Life, or, The Rutland Rapist",elfinette,283,39

It was summer of 2007. I was sixteen at the time, if you know what I mean) attacking young women. The tale went that he would find them on a bus or at a bus stop, follow them until they were alone and then sexually assault them. I thought it was just a rumour, a rumour that persisted all summer and seemed to grow more elaborate and wild rather than fading with time.

On the second day of school rumour became fact the police liaison for our high school held an assembly for all of the female students. She told us that there was a man who was targeting young women, a few had been assaulted but managed to get away. She told us to be safe and to never walk alone, especially at night. I didn't listen. Like an irresponsible teenager I continued with my late night adventures like I was invincible. 

At the time my then-best friend was dating a guy who really creeped me out. At the time I was casually dating a less-than-stellar guy myself, maybe a little unmotivated, but an okay person. At the time I couldn't figure out what it was that raised red flags for me, but I suspect it was his body language- that subtle communication that can give away so much.

My friend and I had been growing slowly apart through high school. When she invited me for a sleepover just after Hallowe'en I thought it'd be fun. We could watch a Disney movie and eat timbits! It'd be great! When I arrived I was suddenly doubtful. When I accepted the invitation I didn't know that her boyfriend had moved temporarily into her house. There were two bedroom upstairs. Boyfriend was staying in the room beside my best friend's. I thought it was a weird situation, so I stayed.

Throughout the evening the boyfriend would make little comments here and there, he suggested ""jokingly"" that we could have a threesome. My friend kicked him out of her room and told him to stop being gross. I was suddenly on edge. I didn't like the way he was looking at me as he left.

I was so lost in my own thoughts I hardly remember the movie. The movie ended around midnight and my friend fell asleep before it was over. I turned off the television and flopped onto the mattress

I told myself that I was just being paranoid- and yet, mine so near to the door that if I reached out my leg I could close it. The door only opened a crack before I reacted- on instinct I stretched out my leg and pushed against the door, quickly shutting it.

My heart was beating so fast as my brain whirred through the scenario. Was it a burglar? No, just tried the door again. And again. I scooched further down the mattress to put both of my feet against the door.

It was as if he couldn't quite decide what he wanted to do. He would try the door once or twice, then come back to try the door again. The door had no lock, so if I didn't keep my legs against the door he could open it easily. I wasn't sure what to do, so I just kept doing what I was doing. Finally, after about thirty minutes of silently trying the door, he went back to his room. I didn't hear anything else after, so I think he fell asleep. For obvious reasons

I had somewhere to be early the next morning, mostly intuition, but that I had a tip about the guy assaulting women in my neighbourhood. The officer thanked me for the tip and reminded me to stay safe. For once I listened: I didn't go on any nighttime walks for the next little while.

Soon after, the guy sexually assaulting women. I guess the police were already suspicious of him, so when his DNA was matched to the last assault scene, he was caught. It was a terrible thing to go through but my friend was really brave and she even worked with the police to get justice for the victims.

The boyfriend pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual assault and three counts of sexual assault causing bodily harm in May 2009. He was sentenced to five years in prison and to be listed on the sex offender registry for twenty years. You can see two articles about him here:

Things started about a decade ago.  I was either a sophomore or junior in high school and was one of those that was picked on a lot.  Mostly because I really didn’t make an effort to be too friendly.  After all, I did make a few friends.  One of them was this guy in my art class.  Shy, socially-awkward, soft-spoken, but generally okay.  We bonded over anime and video games and everything seemed cool.


School ended for the year, I’ve never been too social.


End of summer


Apparently my absence during our time off had bothered him.  He was suddenly very clingy, and really, as a teenaged girl who didn’t know any better, I was pretty flattered by all of the attention.


The flattered feeling ended when he’d start showing up at all of my rehearsals for the school play.  He’d show up at every art club meeting, he’d randomly be at my house.


Not knocking on the door, a house or two down.  Pretty sure I heard him outside my window, but never had any proof.  


I never told my mom, and they took action.  I don’t know any of the details, but I do know that the boy quit school and was banned from the campus.  Things are cool now, yeah?  Didn’t see him again and rumors spread around that the police had gotten involved.  I personally didn’t (and still don’t) believe those, because I was never contacted by law enforcement.


Happy ending, where he’s vaguely threatening.  But I’m hours away and think nothing of it.


In fact


But things are never that simple


Keep in mind that we’re over a decade away from our initial meeting now.  I’m back in my hometown


So one evening as I get into work, blah blah stubbed toe.  ...Like I said, rural emergency room and we hardly ever have a real emergency.  One of the patients did have something wrong with her though, and it looked like she was going to be admitted to our hospital.


While I’m catching up on this and other assorted things, I’m pretty fond of metal myself) and a fucking fedora is standing there.


And he glanced at me with the most hate-filled, I’m used to getting dirty looks in my job, and I’ve even been threatened before because a doctor wouldn’t give out narcotics to a seeker.  This is nothing unusual for me...but that look was unlike any other.  This wasn’t some stoned-out asshole, this was something personal.


At this point, and let me take over.  Once again I looked over the patient list and one of the names finally looks vaguely familiar.  I looked at the paperwork, and there it was, under emergency contact.  His name.


It was nothing like getting hit with a ton of bricks.  It was more like a cold wave soaking me.  My breath caught in my throat and my chest tightened.  In fact


Quietly I let my nurses know what’s going on.  Since he hadn’t said anything or actually done anything, he stopped at my desk.


Now, and he just snarled out, jabbing his finger at my chest across the desk.


“I will be seeing YOU later


Yeah, but all I could manage was something like a squeak and a cringe backward.  SO HEROIC.


Ahem.  Anyway


As morning came, I see him leave again.  Not enough time to actually visit, and already creeped out enough, I asked a few of our surprisingly awake paramedics (they’re usually asleep around this time) to escort me to my car when my relief got there.


They did so without question


My paramedic friends walked me to my car


It’s a little difficult


He gave up, and also reported this to my boss and administration.  


They did nothing but say “If he comes again


Yeeeeah


I haven’t seen him since, he doesn’t know where I live, or my married name, so chances are I’d only see him in the ER, or maybe at the store or something. Always a public place.

I checked Facebook on our drive out to the site, ""Hey, I wish I knew somebody like you when I was in high school. We have a lot of the same interests, and you're pretty cute.""

After checking out his page, ""Haha, thanks!"" 

He replied again later, he sent me another along the lines of, ""Okay, I don't usually do this. But I was wondering if I could take you out on a date sometime?""
I was flattered,"" was all I could think of as a reply. 

Even though I denied his friend request, posted about ten minutes after I sent my rejection, read: ""Girl I like rejected me... crying like a bitch."" Like, WHAT?! Homeboy, I don't know you!!!

I get another message from him that says, hoping that'd be the end of it. It was not.

I ignored the message and prayed to god that he wasn't going to show up at the concert too. 

Skip ahead a few weeks, when I get a message from somebody that I don't follow on tumblr. All it says is, ""Oh god, it was you."" Huh? I go to their blog, and oh god, it was him.

Near the end of the episode, so I sneaked into the guest room and looked out the window. In the driveway was a car I had never seen, and the in the driver's seat was a guy with a mask on. This, already made me want to panic, but I also looked at my door and saw another masked guy was waiting. There was a rifle my dad owned under the guest bed that I took out and loaded, but I was too freaked out to answer the door. Plus, I was trembling too much to actually aim. So, too.

We kept having to stop throwing the ball because one car would pass by over and over. Finally, again, told him no.

I was 28 at the time and enjoy cussing more than I should but not when I was that age.   I notice that one of the guys voices is deep. Not Barry White deep but grown ass man deep.  Our apartment is right next to the pool on the first floor so I decide to take a look. 

All the girls are from the surrounding buildings but I don't recognize either one of the two guys that are talking to them. I do recognize that these ARE grown ass men talking two little girls who clearly have no idea how stupid they are being talking about blowjobs and their bra sizes. 

I go inside to take my dog for a walk aka bathroom break and to get a good look at these guys because for whatever reason my adrenaline is starting to flow and I have this overwhelming sense that shit is not right.  In the minute it took me to put the dog on a leash they are gone from the pool area.  I walk towards the office and the front of the complex where I had initially seen the group. Sure enough there they were saying their goodbyes. 

So as the girls turn to walk back to their building they are completely oblivious to the fact that the guys have gotten back out of their care and are following them about 30 feet behind them. I have no idea what comes over me and I shout at the guys ""why are you following my sister man?""  They look at me (I am not at all intimidating looking especially with a dachshund on a leash) and keep walking after the girls. I start walking towards them with pace and yell again ""what the fuck man! Why you following little girls?""

They turn and bolt at the same moment the apartment manager comes trotting out of the office asking questions about what happened. Apparently these guys were known in the area and were not allowed near the apartments or children. She never said why but I assume because of crimes against minors because a cop came knocking on my door within the hour to take a statement from me.  

When my wife got home and heard this she marched over to the apartments of the girls and talked to their moms about it and none of them seemed too interested or even that they believed my wife.

Davie was the kind of guy that thinks he is very clever and cuttingly sarcastic, for telling girls what they wanted to hear.

Emma was my friend. She was sweet, and seriously naive. She wasn't the sharpest crayon in the box either, but her good nature and sense of humor made her well-liked.

One Wednesday night in July

Emma was almost unbearable to talk to for the next two days. All she would talk about was Davie, I went over to Emma's in the afternoon to braid her hair and lend some ""emotional support"" before her first date.

In a neighborhood near ours there was a small park. It had trees and wetland all around it, if I had to take one for the team to keep Emma safe, then so be it. Aaron said yes.

We met in the evening at the park. Aaron seemed like an okay kid, because when we got back Davie was wearing his jacket again and no one was speaking. I asked Emma if she wanted to leave and she tearfully said yes.

We said goodbye to the guys (Davie was sulking) and began to walk home. Emma explained that Davie had made a sexual comment that embarrassed her, Davie caught up to us. He told Emma he was really sorry and asked her to come back. He said that Aaron had some coolers and glowsticks in his backpack and that we could have a cool party if we stuck around.

Emma and I had an argument then. I can't remember the details, I'm going home. Emma went back to hang out with Aaron and Davie and I made my way up the stairs.

I stopped at the top of the stairs and sat down. I was stubborn but I didn't want to leave Emma alone. From where I was sitting I could see the three of them

I ran like the wind down the stairs and across the field. When I reached the three of them I found Emma pressed up against the side of the jungle gym

I grabbed Aaron first and pulled him off of her. He offered no resistance, he actually ran away. I then turned to Davie who, remarkably, knew I was there and was still trying to undress Emma. I jumped him. We ended up wrestling in the pea gravel, me going for his eyes and his throat in a rage, him laughing as if it were a great game. He was much larger than fifteen-year-old me, but as he was laughing and trying to hold me down I managed to get a good punch in to his throat.

While he was gasping for air I got on top of him broke his arm. I didn't mean to- I'm not actually sure how it happened, I kicked him in the stomach and yelled that if he ever touched Emma again, or if he tried anything with any other girl, I would break his other arm. Then I grabbed Emma and we ran like we had just committed a crime, which I guess I just had.

Emma cried a lot. She cried, but she wouldn't do it and begged me not to. Her parents were pretty severely abusive (I had called social services twice on them when we were younger) and she was terrified of her parents finding out what had happened and punishing her for it. So, I did the stupid thing and I didn't tell anyone.

Davie walked around with a neon pink cast for the rest of the summer. He acted very proud of it and told everyone that he got hit by a car while rollerblading at night. My best friend ended up dating a friend of Davie's

It was a Friday morning. The day before, I would stay up until 3:00 on reddit. The last subreddit I was on before going to sleep was this one.

I woke up feeling strange, no older than six years old, with a demented look on his face. He has two little toys, one in each hand. I ask him whats wrong but instead he just tries to push past me into the house. I gently nudge him back outside, but he keeps trying to come in. So, not knowing what to do, I just close the door on him.

The doorbell starts ringing again. I ignore it for three minutes, the kid sprints into the house past me. He sits himself down in the kitchen and starts playing with the two toys he brought. I had no idea what the fuck I was supposed to do in this situation, so I just called the police.

While I waited for them to come, unlocking and re-locking various doors, and wandering into various rooms. The police finally came (this woke my sister up). They struggled to get the kid into their car to take him back to the station and find his parents. The police found the parents and got informed that the kid is EXTREMELY autistic and that the he's snuck out of his house before. 

Okay whatever, his parents were nice, everything was taken care of.

Lol no.

I went to bed at around 11, I see the Indian kid walk upstairs with the same exact fucking toys in his hand. The second he sees me, he makes a strange moaning noise, I thought I saw him drop something, and he runs back downstairs. I hear the front-door close, and after waiting five minutes, I run downstairs, run back up and realize I pissed myself.

When I awoke my parents, the phone rings. When I pick it up, the parents of the little Indian kid say that he wants to talk to me. He gets on the phone, it's the first time I ever heard him say anything to anyone. He asks me for the toy truck he dropped last night.

So. One of the keys to our house is winging its way through the standard (not special or recorded) post in an envelope with our address on it. Unsurprisingly, I'm phoning the emergency locksmith and forking out the £120 to have the lock changed. 

Fast-forward a few weeks, I hear hushed voice and quiet footsteps coming from below my head. I peek out of the corner of the blind and freeze as I hear the unmistakeable sound of a key being tried in a lock, and only remember to breathe again when I see them walk back down our path, carefully open our gate, and close it behind them. 

Obviously, it'll be fine' - and then suddenly found ourselves - six average, not self-defence-trained girls - in our house with a couple of men whose intentions would not have been tea-party-orientated.

Anyway, really, but it's a gated community and we are pretty secluded up on a hill. Now, all you REALLY have to do if you want to get in but don't know the code is wait for someone to go through the gate before you. Some good that does security-wise, I know. But it's a very quiet community and everyone knows each other and gets along, so it's usually only the odd curious explorer or lost delivery guy. Oh, and 19 year old gal here by the way

Now, myself taking advantage of the opportunity to sleep in. By about 10 I was up and just letting the dogs outside when I heard a knock at the door. We have a glass front door (I decidedly hate those now.) and I could see what certainly looked to be a delivery guy at the door. (And he could see I was home so I couldn't avoid answering. Glass doors gotta work both ways, I guess.) My mom's always ordering things, so I figured it was something I had to sign for or the guy would have just left it there and gone. I walk over and open the door, more concerned with the fact that I very obviously had just rolled out of bed more then anything. There in the doorway is a skinny, white guy of about 30 with sandy-ish hair wearing a brown uniform. Collared work shirt and matching brown pants, like UPS. However I notice there's no logo on the shirt. In fact, name, honestly. His eyes weren't meeting mine, he said. He looked behind me as he spoke

This was creepy enough, I hadn't been hurt and the guy was gone, so the threat was over right? As I said, our neighborhood's very close and most the neighbors are close family friends. My dad emailed them all a description of what had happened. I went about the day until dinner time when he told me he had something to tell me. He and my mom hadn't told me before so as to not freak me out.

Apparently a few months previously, she had apparently gone around the side of the house into her room and hid, and called either the cops, her parents or both, (not sure of all the details) and waited while she saw this man walking around in the house. There are actually windows in some of the walls in the interior of their house, so she could see from her room into the kitchen, family room etc. He walked around, and went out to check if he'd gone. She saw him drive away and the car he left in. 

It was her mother who had replied to my dad's email. She gave a description of the man who had entered their home. He had been white, I don't know if I'd have been able to be so calm about that guy talking to me at the door. We filed a report that day. The cop came to our house, and seemed convinced it was a would-be robber. I don't think so. Something was up with that guy. He was too socially awkward, he seemed like he didn't know how or didn't care to interact with other people. He looked way too pleased when I answered the door and when he saw the empty house inside. And he'd walked right past valuables laying out in the open when he'd entered the neighbors. And who knows what things could have been in that fanny pack. Or tools. I truly believe there are some people out there who are just not right. I'm so glad I didn't let him know I was home alone. Thanks for reading :)

1356530220.0,15guca,He was watching me from the field behind my house,ckincaid,289,44,32,"This story starts with my being assaulted in November 2011.  It may be(and probably is

I don't talk much about the assault, got off the train, and walked through a tunnel towards the southeast exit.  I was completely alone, or at least I thought I was, until a guy suddenly grabbed me, held a knife to my throat (I still have a scar) and hissed ""scream and I will kill you.""  Afterwards, he took all my ID, date of birth and address on it), and my college is not exactly shy about blabbing personal info to anyone who calls), so I could see him in the street or outside the college and have no idea it was him.

On to the main story.

One day, maybe 100m or so, but they were taking the same turns as me.  That doesn't necessarily mean much, it's a fairly common route back from town for people living in our estate, but it put me on edge, especially once we got closer to my house and he was speeding up, closing the gap little by little.  I really, because I would be alone in the house for the next few hours at least, bolted to the door, there's a creeper following me!""  Seemingly convinced that the house was full of large muscled men about to come to my aid

It was scary

After that, and then hang up.  I'm an artist and my phone number is on my business cards and website, so I assumed it's just a prank caller (although my post-traumatic Spidey Sense is kicking in big time.)

After a while, when I came home to find the front door unlocked.  I know I locked it, because I live in a dodgy area (so dodgy there are two more locked internal doors between the front door and the stairs to the bedrooms), but nothing had been taken, at least that I could see, so no one really took me seriously.  I called the police, who didn't really give a flying fuck, they finally agreed to have a police APV drive past every so often and keep an eye out.  That turned out to be bullcrap

A while after that, got in, and sat on the couch to watch Air Crash Investigation with my cats.  I noticed the cats seemed a little bit skittish, but they are strange creatures and so I ignored it... until I went to go and get the laundry out of the washer, which was in the kitchen on the other side of the hallway.

The kitchen door is always closed because otherwise the cats will eat all the food, completely awash with water.  And the washing machine was empty.

I just about shit myself.

I turned around, and phoned my housemate to ask if she'd been home that day.  She of course said no, and asked what was wrong.  When I told her I thought someone had been in the house, she asked if anything had been stolen, but all the electronics were still there - laptop, TV, Wii, even though there is a part of me going ""WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING LAUNDRY??""

That was it for me.  I grabbed the cats and booked it outside to call the poiice again.  Once again, and he went through my house and established no one else was there, and told me to call if there was anything else.  Not sure what else to do (he had to go to work, and I was already wondering if I was just being paranoid - after all, how could he have gotten in without breaking a window?), I went back inside, but didn't move off the sofa until my housemate came home.

Later that week

Weeks pass.  Nothing else happens, but what can I say, I'm great at finding explanations for things.  More time passes, and my housemate flies home to England to visit her parents.  I'm a little wary, obviously, but tell myself there's nothing to worry about and get on with things.  This works for a few days, until one night  about 1am I'm sitting in my bedroom doing online jigsaw puzzles

There was a man standing right on the other side of the fence between my yard and the empty field behind my house.  Not moving, so I closed the curtains and tried to ignore it.  Twenty minutes or so later, curiosity gets the better of me and I open the curtains again.

He's still there

I flip out

""There's a man standing outside watching me""
""Where?""
""The field behind my house
""Is he on your property?""
""...No?""
""Call us when he is""
""But... he's been there nearly half an hour
""Call us when he's on your property.""

Great.  So glad I have these brave officers on my side.

An hour later he's still there.  He still hasn't moved.  I crack and grab the phone again.

""Hi, and-""
""Is he on your property?""

The whole charade is repeated all over again.  I'd grab my stuff and get out

Once again

He got there remarkably fast, I'd hate to be anyone who tried to break into my house, what with all my guns and all!""  He glanced around, said ""Oh, there's that pesky rat!"" and raised, aimed, and discharged the gun in one fluid motion into the ground maybe six feet in front of him.

I wish I could say the guy ran away

Sean slept on the couch that night.

I live in a one-bedroom in a fairly nice apartment complex.  It's just me, and my cat (Miss Mewsy is her name and she's the best cat ever) and I rarely get visitors since all my friends live a 20 minutes bus ride away and I usually go to them.  Today was cleaning day, and I was busying myself around the apartment, vacuuming and dusting and being all womanly.  Even had cookies in the oven.  I had just taken out the trash and gotten back inside to sit down and have a cup of tea when I heard the door open.

1360608932.0,18bnd9,The Psycho From Sophomore Year,FirstBreath1,304,62,27,"Originally a /r/NoSleep post. A few people suggested I post here as well

---

Everyone has a story of someone in their past whom they expect to see on the nightly news. That steroid fused father who got thrown out of his kid’s soccer game. The moronic prankster who sent out an anonymous bomb threat just to cut class. That ex who could never quite give up. For me, a small voice in the back of my head creeps up, from a whisper to a crescendo… What if? What if that guy finally did what he said he would? And I never told anyone. I can’t live with that. So now, I’m telling you. 

There aren’t any ghouls, or delusions of grandeur. This is the story of the truest horror I've experienced my entire life, one that I’ve kept to myself for far too long. This is the story of the psychopath who ruined my Sophomore year of college.
 
I went to a state school in the heart of New Jersey. My life wasn't all that different from your average college experience

The area, we were forced to move out for a couple of days because of an electrical fire in the upstairs apartment. It was fairly common for someone to be mugged late at night, and if you went down a few blocks, shootings were not unheard of either.
 
I rented the house with five other guys, drinking, debauchery. Sleep was for the day, and class was for the dumb. 
 
One girl in particular, and we had become good friends in the process. Alyssa was the type of girl that had to try every obscure activity once. What better way to enjoy the “college experience”, than to try everything? Starcraft club? Check. Classics club dress up night? Check. Getting stoned and passing out on the roof? Check. It was her idea to move somewhere nearby, and I was naturally all for it.
 
One day, I believe it was called. To be honest, I wasn’t one to sacrifice my time for these events. They usually involved forced social interactions, that almost always led to nothing but twenty kids desperately eyeing the clock. However, I hadn't been out all that much, and I had been pigeonholing myself to my own group of friends for quite sometime. It was time to meet some new people, so I decided to give it a shot.

Alyssa and I got to the class fives minutes late, awkward Freshmen who were just trying to meet new friends. One guy, however, stood out to me. He stood at the back of the room, away from all the mini groups and circles that had formed. He sat on the floor with his legs spread and pulled up to his chest, and he looked straight at the floor with a surly look painted on his stoic face.
 
For a reason that I can’t really explain, no thinner, no fatter. His hair wasn't too long, or too short. He wore a pair of blue jeans and a plain white shirt. But the way he avoided eye contact with anyone in the room, for the entirety of the lecture, still gives me chills to this day.
 
After a brief introduction and an hour or so of instruction and lecture, was not so lucky.
 
Now, far more interested in my partner than what was going on with Alyssa. When it was time to go, I walked over to Alyssa and her partner and said hello. She smiled nervously at me, pretending to be incredibly involved with putting things in her backpack, while her partner glared at me for about ten seconds. I opened my mouth to introduce myself, and he turned and walked away.

“What was that about?” I had asked her

“I have no idea

Thinking little of it, I don’t remember much of that night. So let’s move on to the next morning.

Alyssa woke up and had five emails. All from different addresses, so I’ll have to paraphrase:

----

**Email 1**
Hello

**Email 2**
Do you know of any parties tonight? I’d love to bring you to one

**Email 3**
 Do you use this email often?

**Email 4**
Please write back with your number.

**Email 5**
I added you on Facebook. My name there is Joe Simpson.

---

First off, Alyssa responded with a kind yet firm email. She lied and said her boyfriend (one of my room mates) was very protective, and didn’t want her giving her number out to guys. After that, he didn’t respond through email.

Second

I have no idea why he liked alternate names

Then it started to get creepier. He would create names that meant something to her. Jim Carry, he tried her favorite author, musician, athlete. We never knew how he learned so much about her.

The messages started to get more… descriptive, will you see me?” Ignoring him only made it worse. The messages turned into phone calls after he, somehow, got her phone number.

He would call in the middle of the night. 1 AM, begging for him to leave her alone.

Once he got Alyssa’s phone number

When it got to the point that they were concerned for their safety, schools were not nearly as concerned about what they viewed as ‘an argument’ among college students. Since he had never physically threatened either Alyssa or her boyfriend, there was nothing they could do but bring him in for a talk.

That didn’t help.

Three days later

It was her address.

Funny how two words on 4x4 screen can make you fear for your safety, and asked if she could stay at our place for a little bit. She didn’t have any other guy friends in the area, and she didn’t have the money for a hotel. Naturally, we told her of course. What did one guy have against six overconfident 19 year olds?

I was out late that night. My room mates stayed at home

Something about him just did not seem... correct. He used to call Sunny in from school a lot so she could hang out at home. One time I called myself in from school to hang out with her. He knew about it

The summer before 9th grade, especially when Sunny's mom was at work. He was always making an effort to hang around us girls, but stopped making any effort to be a father figure to Sunny's older brother.
Rich had moved in with his parents, and were never there. Us three girls would all sleep on the floor in this big upstairs playroom. Presumably, Rich slept in his old bedroom. But one morning, very early in the morning, I woke up on that floor and felt as though someone was watching me. I lay very still for a moment, looked around, and saw Rich over by the wall, 'Good morning.' And he slunk out of the room without a word. 

About a week later, Rich was gone to work. And Sunny was *furious* at him, although she did not say why. She said she never wanted to see him again, and asked us to help her pack up her things. We went through the house and gathered up her stuff. I remember grabbing her keys off of a dresser and slipping them in my pocket so we wouldn't forget them. We then walked the two miles to her mom's place. Halfway there, Sunny panicked, thinking she'd forgotten her keys. She was very upset and screamed at me when I gave them to her. I mention this because I think it illustrates how upset she was, especially at the thought of having to go back to that house. Sunny was kind of the 'pack leader' for our group of girls, we didn't push for details.

Sunny was true to her word and refused to see Rich again. He would call a lot, and finally he stopped coming around. I think it helped that Sunny's mom got a new boyfriend and he moved in.

I found out months later that Rich had been molesting Sunny. He told her that he wanted to marry her now that he'd divorced her mom. She didn't tell her mom, and the mom went to the police. Sunny had to give a statement, I know that much. And I remember her telling me that he admitted to abusing her. I don't know what kind of sentence he got. Sunny went through some rough years, but she's got a good life now.

My parents never knew about any of this. It's amazing the things that happen, let your kids know that adults that let you break rules (smoking cigarettes, skipping school) are not actually cool.

Back in 2005 when I was 18 I had just dropped out of highschool in mn. It was about halfway through the school year and I just didn't have the credits I needed to graduate. I had some health problems my junior year and was altogether frustrated with my life at this point in time. I was more concerned with drinking than I was school. So I dropped out and bought a plane ticket and went to live for awhile with my cousin and his girlfriend in Washington state. They lived in a town about an hour north of Seattle. I also had some friends that were a year older than me living down in Seattle. I would occasionally drive down to the city to spend a few days with them. Go to concerts and things like that. 

After a particular stint in Seattle I decided to head back north to my cousins place. Me being the financially impaired individual that I was at the time
So I pull in and go to the pay phone to begin to call the very few contacts that I know in this state. I had no money so I had to call collect. So I get ahold of my cousin and he happens to be about three hours away in his hometown and drunk no less. No luck there so I call his girlfriend and she never answers. Everyone I know in Seattle doesn't own a car

So I get settled with my seat reclined and using a hoodie as a blanket. I'm there for about twenty minutes when a van pulls into the rest area. It was a one of those chevy astro vans. The van parks and out gets your typical creeper. About five foot five. Pudgy. Balding. Thick glasses. Creeper begins walking around the parking area glancing into all of the parked cars. There were about three other cars at the time. He walks slowly right in front of my car and just stares me down for what seems like an hour. 

At this point I'm pretty sure my future involves me being referenced in a documentary about serial killers. 
So creeper guy gets back in his van and parks it so he is behind me on the other side of the parking lot. ( I am parked facing the bathroom area and he is parked behind me facing the wooded area) 

At this point I am no longer reclined and relaxed. I am now sitting quite awake and am not taking my eyes off this shit head. I can look in my side view mirror and see him in his side view mirror just staring at my car. This goes on for about two hours and he would occasionally get out of his van and go stand in the woods in the darkness. I could tell he was still watching me because I could see the cherry on his cigarette light up as he would inhale. 
At this point I'm pretty on edge and have to piss like crazy. There is no way in hell I am going to walk into that bathroom with this guy around. I decide to call state patrol and have them kick this guy out of here. So I ring the state patrol and tell them the situation. They say they will send a trooper through. 

So I hang up the phone and am kind of pacing around all while keeping my eye on this creep-o. After about thirty seconds the pay phone rings. I'm thinking its state patrol calling back for some reason. I answer

Me: ""hello?"" 

Caller: ""you want your dick sucked"" 

Me: -shocked silence- 

Caller: "" let me suck your dick"" 

Me: ""what the fuck? Fuck no"" 

I slam the receiver down. The damned creeper has the pay phone number and is calling me from the woods. I am slightly terrified at this point and am kinda frozen but ready to run a million miles an hour if necessary. I've got my eye on the woods. The phone rings again. Can't decide to answer or not. I don't want to miss state patrol if they are calling for some reason. So I answer silently 

Me:........

Creeper: ""come on

At this point this piece of turd has threatened me so I immediately go into rage mode. I start quickly for my car when I remember there is an axe handle in the back end for situations like this I suppose. As I'm walking towards the car the creeper starts out of the woods and is walking towards me! 

I get to my car

"" motherfucker get back in your van and get the fuck out of here or I am going to bash your skull in."" 

He stops in his tracks. Stares at me kind of accessing me. He turns around gets in his van and slowly drives away staring at me. 

I am completely shaking due to the adrenaline when the trooper finally arrives. So I tell him the whole story and he takes my information and says he can drive me up the highway to the Denny's so I can stay the rest of the night safe there. He asks if we can first go to the other side of the highway to see if the guy has just switched rest areas. I agree. 
We pull in to the rest area and lo and behold there's the van. The trooper approaches the van and is talking to the guy for about five minutes and I can tell the trooper is giving him the third degree. Sticking his finger in his face and raising his voice. The trooper returns and tells me the situation. 

Apparently there was nothing he could do to charge the guy at this point in time (seemed odd to me

So I get dropped at Denny's and my cousin eventually picks me up and I tell him the story. We have a good laugh being able to look back on it. We go back the next day with a can of gas to get my car. End of story

We arrive at my car and there is a note under my wiper. From the damn creeper. It was written in the form of poem.  I can't remember it exactly but it went something like this 

You shoulda shut your mouth you stupid little bitch 

Somebody shoulda taught you to never go and snitch 

You should go and get back on mommas tit..... 


It went on for several pages but can't remember more. The guy had cut all the brake lines and everything he could underneath the car. We called the troopers again. They came and took the note and took some more information. 

It wasn't even my car. A friend of mine had been visiting from mn and wanted to buy a car and road trip back to mn. He decided against it and left the car and said I could use it and he would make plans to get it later. 

I didn't stay in Washington much longer after that. I spoke to an investigator one more time but nothing ever came of it and I don't know why. They knew who the guy was and everything. I was over it and just wanted to move on. 

For the short time I was in Washington after this me and my cousin would pull into every rest stop we passed hoping to find this guy. In retrospect its a good thing we never saw him again because we were dead set on seriously hurting him. 

TL/DR: got stalked and propositioned by a typical perv at a rest stop.

One night, which was right next to me, to see what time of day it was. It was very dark (it was a rural town so there were no cars, neighbors, or streetlights), so I guessed that it was somewhere between 2 A.M. and 4 A.M. A few seconds after I closed the blinds, I heard a deep male voice whisper ""Pssst. Hey, but since her house is pretty small, it was probably your imagination"" and sat still in my bed for an hour staring at the door. 

I was eventually able to fall asleep, my grandma told me what she saw on the news before I woke up again. A convict was being transported to a new prison and had escaped from the transport less than a mile from the house. I never looked into it because I had no intentions of finding out what he was convicted of.

So, and basically answer anything people asked me. For the most part, I got through this period of my life without running into any trouble. Eventually I did something really stupid though.

Like most teenage boys, someone messaged me. I didn't even know you COULD message people over Kazaa, so I was surprised and a bit freaked out. From what I can remember, they just wanted to know more about me and what kind of porn I liked. I should probably mention I'm gay, and I'd never spoken about it with anyone in my life (I was only like 13 at this point), so I actually replied and started a conversation with this person, who told me his name was Glen.

Eventually Glen convinced me to add him to MSN Messenger, but he was always kind of off. I can't remember any details since this was over a decade ago, but I remember that he was interested in furry porn (don't ask if you don't know what that is) and kept trying to get me into it, but it weirded me out.

At some point, phone number, address. Holy shit was that ever stupid of me. He lived in a different country than me, so we didn't talk over the phone often, and at first he would always tell me on MSN before he phoned so that my parents wouldn't answer first. 

Eventually, very late at night. He wouldn't let me hang up, guilting me into talking to him longer, until I started getting really freaked out and realized I fucked up by giving some random person my phone number. I think I made up some kind of lie about being grounded from the phone, so he stopped calling for a while and we only spoke online.

At this point, knowing he'd phone me if I didn't. Eventually, he disappeared online and I was realized, thinking it was over.

Then the letters started.

He had never once asked if it was ok to send me anything, and had pictures of the most fucked up porn you can imagine folded into them. Keep in mind I was not even close to being 16, much less an adult, at this point so this was really not appropriate. My parents were curious about the letters, but I made up some kind of lie about having made a pen pal, and they believed it and never opened any of the letters. That is probably the biggest bullet I dodged, though it was honestly probably a mistake not telling them.

I never once replied to any of the letters, so he got angry and blocked me on MSN. I was worried that he would call the house and try to talk to my parents, tell them lies or personal things I had divulged. 

He never called again, heavily stuffed and coloured really strangely. It was pink, purple and red and my parents were super confused when it arrived. I was afraid to open it, really not knowing what to expect. I don't even know how to properly describe what was inside. There was the usual variety of creepy furry porn, a small, folded flag of his country, and uh, but I seem to recall some of it being laughably bad drawn porn. Opening this package and inspecting the insides was the biggest WTF moment of my life.

He never sent anything again

Sorry, since I knew it was finally over.

""Uh... Not... Much..."" I just kinda stammered out, his home town (Millville is what he said), blah blah bullshit. I just kind of ""mmhmm'd"" at him as I finally broke into the safety of the young cashier's vision. She was probably only a little under my age so I hoped she would understand how creepy this guy was being.

Apparently not, he was there.

""Where are you going? I want your number."" 

OH GOD. I just sat there for a second, nudging him. He KICKED it back, fully open to where I couldn't reach around him. I grabbed my wallet (where I keep my cellphone) and threatened to call the cops if he didn't go away. He got this weird look on his face, like extremely pissed mixed with rejection. 

""Oh come on, in the knee. He fell backwards on his ass onto the pavement and I quickly got my phone out and dialed the cops and my work to tell them what had happened and that I would be a bit late.

The cops came and arrested him. The chick in the BP had the nerve to tell them that **I** attacked **HIM**. But they were able to go back through the surveillance and you can clearly see me trying to shut my door and looking pretty damn horrified. I guess he never had any felonies or anything, and then go home and that the police would check on him occasionally. I just kind of hopes it was a family reunion because maybe his mom could have beat some sense into him.

Three weeks later I get a friend request on Facebook from his assfaggot. ""Hey girlie

I practically cried-laughed for a good ten minutes, ""You're a fucking bitch and I hope you die. You're a stupid whore and had no reason to do this shit to me. You ruined my life. Fuck you and fuck your family."" Needless to say I blocked him too.

It was a day just like any other.  I drove back to my Grandpa's from work

I get back to my Grandpa's development and I notice a car has pulled off behind me.  That's a little weird

So, to make it very obvious I know this person is following me.  Finally on a turn I'm able to see who it is following me.  It's some 40ish looking lady who doesn't appear to be very large.  I figure, WTF and I pull over into a cul de sac a block or two from my Grandpa's.  This lady starts pulling up, and I start to roll down the window to see wth she wants.

She starts yelling at me that she's calling the cops.  What?  Why?  Apparently, not red, blue or yellow). I passed her coming out of the last light before my Grandpa's house.  Now she's calling the cops with my plate number etc. and they're apparently going to take me to jail because I'm a scumbag.

I start laughing.  Probably not the correct response, that it's none of her business where I'm going. She starts freaking out, so I get back in the car, and she starts pounding on the windows.

For camp, but I was a good staff member and did). So I call the police, and I tell them what's going on.  Apparently the guy on the other end was sitting adjacent to whoever was talking to Crazy Lady, and said they'd sent a cruiser out already to see what was up (not much to do in this town) and it''d be there in a few minutes.  I explain to the guy what's going on and we have a good chuckle about it.  He says he'll tell the police who're on their way.

Police car shows up a few minutes later, and don't think much of it.  I eat dinner, shower, etc.

If only this were the end.  A few days later I notice a familiar looking SUV out front of my Grandpa's before I leave for work.  As I come out the door it pulls away really quick, holding the day's paper in it to show that it was definitely taken after the initial incident.  I called the police, told them and they said they'd check up on it.

I got a call that afternoon saying that they'd had a talking-to with this lady and she thought she had a right to know where I lived. I was a bit worried about anyone hanging around my Grandpa's as he's old and would be easy to take advantage of or rob and just didn't want some crazy bitch hanging around.  The cops told me that they told her that if I ever saw her near there again that I'd have a case to get a restraining order and that they'd help me do that

Sara and Aaron’s parents often left us at their house alone with alcohol and no rules.  My parents didn't care what I was doing, even if we threw ourselves at them in a drunken haze.  Basically it was Aaron and Sam’s fault we didn't have boyfriends freshman year.

It was one of the last games of the season, win, lose or rain. We drank and hung out, listened to music and played drinking games.  We were all completely average teenagers, with average small town lives.  
After I had consumed far more vodka than orange juice I spilled a drink on the kitchen floor.  Sam helped me clean it up and we stood around talking a little bit before he insisted I go lay down before I fell on my face.  He helped me to Sara’s room gave me a little hug and put me on the bed.  Before he drove home he checked on me

No matter how many times I go over the next day in my head it never seems right.  It was surreal, Aaron and the Douglas County Sheriff stood.  Everyone was way too upset for it to have something we did.  I felt sick and terrified, I couldn't comprehend what was happening.  The Sheriff asked me when the last time I saw Sam was.   I couldn't speak, couldn't figure out what any of them were saying any more.   I managed to say “I was drunk” the Sheriff asked Sara she said the same.  He simply wrote it down and turned away from us.  Very strange.

They had to find Sam, because he had killed his parents.  He killed them when he got home from the party, with an axe from the woodshed.  

He had attended the game and the party then went home.   Picked up an axe and struck his father in the head while he was watching TV.  His mother made it to the phone and dialed 911.  Sam killed her with blows from the axe while she spoke to the 911 operator.   Then he disappeared

Honestly, I was in a daze.  I kept expecting it to be a dream, or a sick joke.  The whole two days I can’t remember what I did, who I talked to.  It didn't help that Sara and I increased our alcohol and drug intake.

It took a few months after getting my license, and generally pretending that we were cooler than we really were. I had picked up everyone that day and even dropped everyone off at home after a perfect day. 



The last friend that I dropped off lived out in the country and it was already after midnight by the time I started home.

 I floored the gas and the car wailed along with me as it went up the hill.  I was in a complete panic and turned on my blinker as I turned left onto my street like a complete idiot.

1361789369.0,196qbf,This could have ended badly. Stupid decisions on my part.,drayb3,269,35,26,"Reading all these stories made me remember this incident from when I was around 9-10 years old. This happened in northern NJ back in the mid '90s.

My parents had gone out for the evening, respectively, at the time. This is one of the first times that I had even been left home alone with them, and I was excited about the responsibility of watching my younger siblings and taking care of the house.

I remember that my siblings were asleep in their rooms and that I was watching TV in the living room - this is around 10pm. All of the lights in the house were out

I got up to go to the bathroom, because there was only one street light on my block and it was at the opposite end of the street from my house. I peeked out the window in the dining room and saw a gold BMW parked in front of the house. The car stayed there for about 2 minutes before driving off. I went to the bathroom and went back to watching TV, shrugging the whole thing off.

I went back to watching TV, as my parents wouldn't be home until around midnight. I peeked out the window again, and it was the same BMW. Only this time, they switched the headlights off. I waited for a few minutes, just watching them, and I was able to see that there were 2 white guys in the car, looking at the house. I'm still sure to this day that they didn't see me.

I started getting really nervous and was not at all thinking clearly, I decided to grab my sling shot and run upstairs to my parents room, where I had a clear view to the street in front of the house - the street is about 30 feet away across the front yard.

I grabbed several rocks from my rock collection, hitting it each time. The car flipped its lights on and the guys in it peeled out. They didn't come back.

As soon as my parents got back I told them what happened and they called the police. I remember my parents telling me that the police confirmed that there had been a few break-ins in the area and that these guys may have been casing the house.

The customers were strange enough

The other employees were average people just trying to make a living. Mostly girls my age

One of the guys, but would also occasionally bag for my line. We talked about music and TV. He was a huge Family Guy fan, so we would quote it back and forth and be silly. 

Then I started to hear strange things about Jason. Nothing specific. Apparently a lot of the girls found him creepy. I didn't understand why. He was never lewd with me at all. I suppose it occasionally slipped into flirty
 
So this went on for about a month. One night my friends were going to the book store for one of the Harry Potter book releases. I was a fan
I get a call from Jason. 

“Hey

“Err...well

“All right!”

So Jason shows up...a bit later than anticipated. We kinda part ways with my friends and go grab a coffee nearby. (We walked there as it was next door.)
We sat chatting for a bit outside. I get a text from my friend. She seems worried about me because she didn't know Jason. I assured her he was fine and that I would give her a heads up if I planned on getting murdered. 

Jason starts getting pissy cause I'm on my phone texting. I apologize and tell him it was just my friend being stupid. Not a big deal. 

“Hey do wanna come to my apartment and watch some Family Guy?”

“Err...I don't know...”

He looked hurt by my hesitation. 

“I don't want to leave my friends. That'd be rude.” 

“I came all the way here...I didn't think we were just going to hang out here all night.” He's getting pushy. A side of him I hadn't seen before. I'm nervous, what's the harm? I'm an indestructible teenager of course with a man who is five years older than me. Seems totally safe! (Sarcasm, my dear readers.)

I honestly can't say why the hell I agreed to go. Adventure? Spontaneity? Testing fate? I really don't know. But before I knew it we were in his truck. He handed over something to me when we first got in. It was a little shot glass with my name on it and some dolphins. 

“I got this for you when I was in Florida.”

“Oh...thanks.” I smiled

About ten minutes from his place

I remember thinking

The policeman shined his flashlight at our eyes and with a  wave of his hand we were off again. My stomach churning. 

The building was huge. I didn't think his apartment was going to be in a such a giant complex. We headed inside. In the elevator

“Are you okay?” He asked.

“Yeah...heh...just don't like elevators.”

His apartment was small. Well kept

“No. Put those away now. PUT them back.” I tell him

He laughed

“Yes. Very nice. Now put them away or I will walk out right now. And don't bring out any more dangerous or weird shit.” I have no idea where my sudden braveness came from

He giggled and put away the katanas (thank fuck), turning my head and lips towards his lips. Fuck that. 

I stand up. 

“No. I can't do that. I want to leave. Bring me home.”

He looks like a combination of hurt and pissed off. Sullenly he gathers his things and without saying a word walks to the car. I am trotting behind

Silently we ride the thirty minutes back to my house. When we pulled up

He didn't respond. He looked nearly in tears. I got out

Unfortunately the strangeness didn't end there. I abruptly quit my job. I hated it anyway

Years pass...I believe I was about twenty. I just got a Facebook account and had a couple close friends on there. Out of nowhere, but it WAS him. The profile picture wasn't a picture of him. It was this face: http://i.imgur.com/gEHJe.jpg

His profile was mostly private

He had no other photos. Just that face. He had NO other friends. A shiver went down my spine

“I miss her. I need her. Her smile.”

“I want to hold her. I never want to see her cry. I will kill myself before ever hurting her.”

And a bunch of long winded bad poetry. I felt sick. My head felt clouded. My heart was racing. After nearly five years he still thinks about me. Obsessing over me. I blocked him. My mind was everywhere. He had dropped me off at my house before...he KNEW where I lived. Has he ever waited outside? Has he ever watched me? Is he still alive? His statuses got more and more suicidal. I was reading his reality slipping from his fingers. I felt guilty. I hated that I caused someone pain. I hated that I sent someone into such a spiral of depression and fixation. 

About six months later his statuses stopped. I unblocked him briefly because my guilt was gnawing at me. What if he killed himself? I should have helped. I needed to know he was okay. I'm weird. This guy that caused me so much anxiety, what's up?”

To my surprise he responded. Good. He was alive. Maybe he just stopped obsessing and got over me and feels fine now. I tried to lie to myself. 

He spills. It's like he had bottled up so much in the past five years that it all came out at once. He apologized for how things happened. He apologized for jeopardizing our friendship. It was weird. More of that nonsense and then he asked if we could still be friends. 

I didn't know this man anymore. I was older and smarter at that point. I really wanted nothing to do with him

Paraphrasing, I'm going to be honest. I contacted you because after reading some of your alarming updates I wanted to know you were okay.”

I used to train to be a gymnast, but Jane is acting really nervous and keeps saying she wants to go and play on the trampoline. I give in and we go I say thanks for showing us the cards and we head outside. 

A few weeks later he asks if we want to watch some pokemon in his room and we go in. This time he locks the door, this somehow seemed legit to me. I thought oh my god, my parents are going to think I was being bad and I'm going to get in so much trouble so I undress. I try to cover myself with the sheets on his bed, but he pulls them away and tells Jane and I to stand on his bed and dance. Jane refuses and he pulls out a length of rope with a bolt tied to the end. He swings it over his head and threatens to hit us and tell everyone we're skanks with it if we dont. She starts to cry and we get up and dance as best we could (having no idea how to sexy dance) he sits back and watches, doesnt do anything just watches. After a while a door closes somewhere in the house and he tells us to get dressed and then tells us to get out. 

The next time he told us to come to his room
This went on till I was about 10 maybe 11, he had just turned 18 and told me to sit on a chair by his bed. I got up and walked over to me with his dick out and almost picked me up. He put me on the bed and laid on top of me, I knew what was coming. I reached down the side of the bed to the metal baseball bat that I seen there many times before and shoved him as best I could. He sat up and said “I was hoping you would fight” and when he came back down I hit him in the head with the bat. He fell back and fell off the bed and leapt up. At this point I was seeing red and didn't care if I got in trouble and I brought the bat down hard on the arm he was shielding himself with and hear d a crack. I then started beating the ever living shit out of him. I told him if he ever touched me or Jane again I would tell everyone what he did and I left. It wasn't until after I got home and washed the blood off myself that I thought, shit how is going to explain being beaten to a pulp without me getting in trouble or telling people what he did. Turns out he thought about this to and living in a “Queenslander” house (on stilts) there was a very long metal staircase at the front of the house. He laid at the bottom and when his parents got home said the Fight Club classic “I fell down the stairs” I found out from Jane that he had fractured his right arm, two ribs and his nose was broken. They moved about 6 months later and I've never seen him or Jane again.

My older brother knew my boyfriend (they were in the same class in high school). He told me to stay away from him because he was abusive. I took this as my brother just being overprotective. I ignored his warnings. After a few months of dating though, he LOST IT. I'm not exaggerating when I say ""lost it,"" either. As soon as I got in the car he started screaming at me. During the argument, he even ripped the side mirror off of his car and threw it at me. It made no sense to damage his own property or why he was so mad. This just showed how irrational he was. He didn't actually lay his hands on me until a few weeks later.

I begged him to get off of me because he was hurting my arms. He just went on and on about how he loved me but I didn't appreciate him.  After I finally agreed to stay, just to get him off of me, he let me go. I ran for the door but he caught me. He literally punched me in the face. I remember being terrified. I stayed. That was the first of many physical fights, or should I say beatings. Typing it out makes me feel embarrassed that I even put up with it. We were together for almost 2 years after this. Shortly after that night, I moved in with him.

After walking on egg shells throughout the rest of our relationship, which is something that happened 3-4 nights a week. He came home , wasted, and wanting to have sex. I was asleep and remember being woken up by him on top of me. I pretty much just laid there and let him do what he needed to do. He was too drunk to finish though and took it out on me. He started screaming at me and choking me, to the point that I almost blacked out. I was struggling to get away from him and he broke my arm. After screaming in pain, he still didn't let up. Finally, he ended up passing out. I called my mom, then home to her house. I had my boyfriend arrested and a restraining order placed (which did nothing).

He called and texted me so many times. The messages ranged from threatening to kill me to how much he loved me and promised he would change. After ignoring him for a few days, even coming by my job. One day, when going on my lunch break, I was walking to my car. He was sitting IN my car. I don't know how he got in there. I ran back inside and called my brother. By the time my brother got there, he was long gone. He contacted me for months after that as well (even after I got a new phone number, which I have no idea how he got). Finally, the calls stopped and he moved on. It's been about 3 years since I heard from him.  I heard he married one of his exes shortly after. I pray that she's safe.

Growing up I was primarily raised by my single mother. She was good about keeping her dating life and mother life separate

On the night this story takes place my mother and one of her best friends went out to have a girls night at a bar. Upon their return I got to see my mom in a very rare state (for her). Drunk. My mother and her friend were like two drunk giggly girls (which I found incredibly entertaining). They had also decided to bring home a male friend (never learned his name so I'll call him Charlie). 

They had met Charlie while at the bar

About an hour into their return, and to the side of the house) and as I am on my way back, closing the gate to the backyard, Charlie randomly appears out of nowhere. I wasn't even aware anyone saw me take the trash out, much less that this guy who had never been in my house before, managed to follow me out to the backyard. I was thrown off but politely said ""hey"". He asked what I was doing. After telling him i took out the trash he continued to try and make small talk with me. 

This went on for probably about twenty minutes. I was already creep-ed out by Charlie randomly following me into the dark backyard, naive, and polite to just walk back inside and get myself out of this growing-creepier-by-the-second conversation. Luckily my mom came wandering into the backyard (I'm assuming she was looking to find where her new gentlemen friend had wandered off to), and she saw Charlie talking to me.. off on the edge of the dark backyard. 

bewilderment ensued. 

She came up and asked what was going on

Within five minutes Charlie was gone

My parents' house is on a pretty busy corner in an older neighborhood in Texas. They installed a fence years ago, and offered him a position at his office. Needless to say he got my room, so when I graduated and came back home I slept on the futon downstairs. I didn't mind since the downstairs was cooler in the summer and my dad refuses to use the A/C unit. 

One night after being home for a few months I wake up suddenly in the middle of the night. Our little shih tzu-maltese was awake on the foot of my bed, but my dog's next move freaked me right the hell out.

After informing her about the contents of the site

To start off, you should expect your family members and/or yourself to be killed as payment). 

Another pretty important piece of information you should know is that my Russian side of the family was very involved in the mob. My great uncle was one of the leaders of a powerful mob back in the late sixties? I'll ask my mom for his last name

My mom was about twenty when she decided that she'd spend her break from medical school near the Black Sea where she'll meet up with some of her friends. She decided she'd come a day early to have fun on the beach before meeting up with her friends. However

She made it to the road and hailed for a cab for a few minutes until a vehicle that looked like one of those expensive private cars rolled up. I don't know if they're widely known, my mother decided to try her luck, because it was either this or she would pass out on the street. 

They let her in, and that's when my mom kind of realized they probably weren't cab drivers. She had no weapons she could use, she was five feet tall and incredibly thin, all she was wearing was a bathing suit and a pullover dress, and she was still ill from the heatstroke. So she decided to use her words instead:

""I don't know if you know who I am, especially my uncle will find you and kill you and your parents and any relatives you may have"" 

She just went on and on about her family and Chechnya's customs until the driver stopped the car and confirmed her statements, they drove her back to her hotel in complete silence and she never saw them again.

TL;DR: mom went into a strangers car and almost got killed but was saved because of her family and the fact that she's Chechen.

back in the mid-eighties, one of his younger female employees had had a bad break up with an abusive boyfriend. and one late night before closing, the boyfriend came into the store with a gun and threatened his ex-girlfriend and the other employee. he got away before the cops got to the store.

the next time that female employee was closing up

now this point and beyond is just speculation by the police.

the female employee was the last person to see milton alive. he left her house and proceeded to head home.

his car was found at the end of his and my parents' street... with bullet holes in it and the driver's side door open. 

his body was found lying over 100 yards away in front of my parents' house, and the grass. 

he had been struck with an axe over 65 times

a neighbor passing by on an early morning jog found his body and called the cops. they knocked on my parents' door and asked if they knew anyone missing. my dad had to identify the body. and milton

my dad said he couldn't tell that milton was blonde.

that day

the cops never found who did it.

and the worst is that my oldest brother, he and my other brother (who was 5 at the time) were afraid of passing by windows at night. my oldest brother's behavioral problems continued until early adulthood.

It might have been around Halloween because I remember my baby brother was wearing some kind of cowboy thing with a hat. I should say that my brother was a REALLY cute baby so it wasn't unusual for random people to comment on it while we were out. 

We were in Burger King waiting on line when this guy walks in behind us, and forget about it, and go about shopping. We were in a CD store when we notice the guy again, but this time he was with another man around the same age.

They were both, but they were both chubby. The shorter guy wore glasses. There wasn't really anything distinct about them that would put them apart from anybody else, and I think that is the scariest part for me. They were talking to each other when they walked in behind us, and while we were shopping one of them stayed at the front of the store while the other one circled around us in the aisles towards the back. My mom says now that this was when she realized something was up, but she didn't want to say anything because she didn't want us to freak out.

So when we left the store, and they were in each one, not even shopping for anything. Just looking at my brother, like pedo sharks. At this point, my mom pulled me aside and told me what was going on. I had also noticed them, but I was 12 and I wasn't really thinking it was anything weird, until my mom confirmed that something really sketchy was happening. We decide we're going to leave

And sure enough the two guys start following us. My mom stopped, ""go find cops."" This mall is in an urban area right outside of the Bronx, and it's fairly small so it wasn't hard for me to find a couple of cops and tell them what was going on. I walked them back to where my family was, and I guess the two guys saw them because they jetted for the parking lot. The cops followed them, and my mom hauled ass back home. As far as I know, they got the plate number of the car the guys were in and it turned out to be registered to some 90 year old woman in Florida. That's all that really came of it though.

In the school I attended

Dr. Johansson liked to keep contact with students and so he decided it would be a lot easier to do so if he had a Facebook account. He started adding people on Facebook from our school
He often posted weird stuff on his wall

For example, nigger, nigger. I don't get it!""

Of course
This was nothing.

He started talking to students, so according to the law they are not allowed to drink. And he pretty much offered alcohol to minors. Remember, he's a civics teacher. He should know this stuff by heart. It's also morals, for God's sake!


Anyway, he decided to talk to me. This was a couple of weeks after he had started contacting students like this. He would speak to me on the Facebook chat. He would ask me things like: ""How do you get girls? Do you have a big dick? Do you often get to sleep with girls after your shows?"" (because I'm an artist), and I found these messages highly disturbing. They became worse: ""You must be such a stallion in bed! You are probably really good!"" and ""Enter the rabbit hole with me. Come on, I'll take care of you!"". I had no clue what the fuck that meant.

That was not everything! After a while, and all would be well! Of course, I said no.

He then apparently got pissed at me and decided not to speak to me much after that I had turned him down a few times. He started talking to one of my near friends instead. It ended up with Dr. Johansson sending my friend a picture of his ass with the caption: ""Please, my friend was 17 at the time whilst Dr. Johansson was around his mid-thirties.

That was taken to court and Dr. Johansson got his little sentence. He was to do community service for a little while and then he was to pay my friend some fine. That was it.

There are a few other eccentricities I could mention that are a little annoying but not very interesting. His main three faults were his constant religious preaching (I’m an atheist), and his addiction to World of Warcraft. He would spend entire nights on his computer until the early morning play the game. It got to be such a nuisance to hear the clicking of the mouse and the pounding on his keys. The light from the screen kept me up until I finally told him that it was bothering me. After that, he would play on his laptop in a study room and I was able to finally sleep again.

Despite all the annoyances, understanding women, and American society. 
I felt I learned a lot about him and I tried to help him by introducing him to my own friends and including him in my own activities but ultimately it proved to be too hard for him for adjust. I continued to be his friend and even printed sheet music from Final Fantasy 7 for him to play on the piano for me. He played magnificently and we actually began to enjoy living together. Everything went fine for a little while until one night I was awoken by a gentle shake.

*“I’m scared”*

*“What’s the matter?”*

*“It’s complicate and you not understand*”

*“It’s really late

It took a few moments for him to reply. I was used to the pauses for him to find the words he wanted to express himself with.

*“I lose Arena partner tonight”*

*“What does that mean?”*

*“God sad me”*

*“Huh?”*

*“You PVP with me”*

*“What the fuck are you talking about?”*

*“PVP

*“You want me to play World of Warcraft?”*

*“Yes”*

*“No

This is the point where everything went downhill. Looking back, he wouldn’t say hello or talk to me. He’d pick up whatever he needed and he would immediately leave the room. I tried to confront him many times but he never responded. This continued for a little while longer until during the middle of the night he woke me up again.

*“Sorry I no talk long time”*

*“Um

*“You know Virginia Tech?”*

The Virginia Tech Massacre is what he was referring to since it had happened recently. I don’t exactly remember the day he mentioned this to me but Virginia Tech had recently happened.

*“Yeah

*""I know how he feel. No friends. English no good. Lonely. People make fun. I no do same is because God and Warcraft”*

This sent a chill up my spine. While I knew that he was completely harmless it sounded like a cry for help. With everything that I knew about him and how behavior had become somewhat erratic

*“Maybe you should talk to the school counselor. She should be able to help you out if you are having any issues”.*

*“I try soon. Play Warcraft. Night”*

He gathered his laptop, he wasn’t in his bed. I called him on his cell phone and he didn’t answer. He actually didn’t return for a full week and never contacted me despite my daily calls and texts. To say I was afraid for him was an understatement. I didn’t know if he had committed suicide or had picked up and left. I went to the school counselor about Joseph’s behavior and his comments to me. She told me to report it to campus authorities and they said they would search for him. I also put in a room transfer request. This was becoming too much of a stress on my life. As much as I liked the guy, he had to sort out his problems.

A several days passed and Joseph hadn’t returned to the room. My room change request was denied and when I asked an RA about it they told me that it would be taken care of soon. Later that day

The police arrived and took the weapon from the drawer and drew up a report. They asked me if the weapon belonged to me, Joseph’s side of the room was emptied and looked spotless like no one had ever lived there.

I attempted to contact him to tell him that I was worried about him and that people were looking for him. He never answered me back. The rest of the semester came and went but I never heard from him again. I tried to get information from the school counselor but she gave me the patient confidentiality explanation and was only able to tell me that Joseph had been found in a near-by park and he wouldn’t be returning to the school because of the policy of weapons on campus. 

I wish I knew how things turned out for Joseph but that’s where the trail of information ends for me. I’ve tried calling his last number but the phone number isn’t in service anymore and I lost it after my old crappy flip phone broke. 

As a side note

Age: 19 at the time

I've always had a fear of home invasions. I grew up in rough areas and it happened a couple of times when I was a child, if being attacked, but more a case of what would I do.

I found out when I was nineteen.

At the time I was at uni and living with my father who worked a night job as a security guard. We lived in a rough neighbourhood- the kind that appears on Top Ten Dangerous Suburb kind of lists. We'd been broken into a bunch of times, it never deterred people. But we left the doors locked, windows had dowling in place, and we did our best- we weren't wealthy.

The night this happened I was at home alone, I lifted my head expecting to see Mr Sooky come wandering into my room but there wasn't any sign of him. No worries, he was probably eating dinner. I go back to my homework when I hear the *cree-creak* again. Okay, Mr Sooky might have the nickname Mr Insy-Outsy, but this is-

There's a man barely a foot behind me. 

I can remember my thought process very distinctly.

*Daddy didn't say the plumber was coming around.*

My desk was crammed into the corner of my room. To my left was a window and behind me a chest of drawers. The man was to my right

*The plumber doesn't come around at nine PM.*

I'm very small. 155cm on a good day and at the time no more than 60kgs soaking wet. This guy was easily hitting 180cm and probably tipping the scales at 100kgs.

*The plumber knocks.*

He was bleeding on my carpet. There was a slash on his face and another on his arm.

*This isn't the plumber.*

And that was when it hit me. This man had come into my house

I started to cry. Not just cry but sob. I didn't know what to do

He told me

My father had given me pepper spray- it was behind my laptop. I had sewing shears- they were beside me. I had a knife on a plate where I had fruit.

I thought to myself

So I offered him my fruit. I'd been slicing up apples, still crying. I noticed he had a phone sticking out of his pocket. While he was distracted- what kind of victim offers the attacker fruit?!- I pointed to the phone.

'I'm going to call the police

While he held the plate I very carefully took his phone from him. It was stupid, if I was watching this as a film I would have been screaming at this stupid girl. But I wasn't thinking. I was stupid, I was shaking and crying and honestly he could have gutted me like a fish and fucked my intestines. Right then I was living my worst fear. 

Unsurprisingly he grabbed me then and pulled me from my desk chair. I had his phone

'I'm going to call the police now

He was still bleeding

The man on the line kept trying to reassure me but also told me to go along with whatever the man was asking me to do. 

That was when he started kissing me.

About ten

The police were suddenly at my door. They started hammering at it and I heard the back gate smash as they came into the back yard. The man yelled at me to not let them in, and something, for two seconds in my head, snapped. I stomped on his instep, and it bought me enough time for him to let go of my wrist and me to sprint the three meters across the living room floor to pull the door open. I immediately sprang back and landed on my tailbone when four police offers- all over 200cms- came flying in through the front door and another three from the back.

I remember thinking it funny they had lasers on their tasers.

I curled back into a ball and sobbed as they struggled with him. He fought

There had been an altercation two blocks away. The man had gotten into a fight over something- drugs

This wound up leading to me becoming a very anxious young woman for a while, 'oh, bother,' about it.

I was asked to attend a court hearing about all this four months later; the man never turned up.

I am a member of the Slam Poetry scene. Basically it is an excuse to get people to listen to performance poetry by adding a competitive element to things. After running through the small scene in my city and wanting to branch out and push my career further I started visiting places within driving distance that I could spit. This lead me to Charlotte

I started at their local ""team"" venue where you compete to be a part of squad that goes to a national competition every year.  I was doing well and was accepted into the local crew pretty readily. 

This lead to longer stays and features at some of the other venues in the city. I started going to one that was particularly popular and good for selling cds. That's where I met him. 

He worked as a bar back. Occasionally got on stage and shared

He slowly started flirting with me more and more. Although in my loose days, smoke his weed with the group in the stock room between sets and hang out at parties and events. 

I always had the tickle in my gut warning me not to get to close but over a year or two we continued to become friends. 

After a while, he is black) and settle down. Again, I never entertained it. There was something gnawing at me. The crazy in his eyes too hard to miss. 

I eventually moved to Denver to take a position teaching poetry and work at a friends law firm.... The second christmas I was there I got the call.

A friend from Charlotte relayed the following. 

He had found his white girl and gotten married. They seemed happy at first but slowly began fighting more and more. It spilled over into the venue and often they had to be separated by friends from physically attacking one another in public. One friend, him pushing his wife followed by her throwing a drink in his face and scratching his neck deep enough to draw blood. She said after the couple had been dragged away from each other she sat with him and smoked a cigarette. She says she laughed and said ""You guys are going to kill each other.""

 Around christmas last year. His wife just stopped coming to the bi-weekly events they both attended regularly. He explained it away that they were on a break. 

Time goes by. No one really questions that they hadn't seen or heard from her in a while. Thinking she was breaking from the whole scene in order to put distance between herself and her husband. Her parents, knowing their daughter would never miss a holiday without atleast a call. They call the police send them to the couples home for a 'well body' check.

The cops arrive. Knock on the door and are let in. They ask him where she is

During this time he had been attending events hosting hip hop nights even publishing a blog on ""Making a marriage work"" on one of the local organizations site. Never once letting on that every night he was going home and sleeping with his murdered wife. 

The sickest part of it all; He has a child from another relationship. A daughter whom he gets to celebrate every other holiday with. That Christmas they opened gifts

I don't know what would have happened if I'd ever had taken him up on his offer to date

 When I was about 10 or 11 there was this neighbor boy who was 18 or so who lived with his mother down the street. She was frequently away at work and he was a burn out always hanging around outside trying to impress us much younger kids who thought he was super cool. He taught us dirty jokes

Well

 I don't remember what exactly set it off, but he said no. I asked if he could bring it outside, but no. His responses kept getting more hostile and aggressive, and in my mind I was panicking because while I felt a sense of foreboding, I was sure I was blowing my chances at acceptance.

 So, and his face just told my mind to get the fuck out, NOW. So I made an excuse and turned on my heel for the door. He began to try to talk me out of leaving and came rushing for the door. I didn't want to look like an idiot running away like a crybaby so I swallowed my urge to run and continued towards the door at a brisk pace but distinctly remember scrunching up my shoulders in anticipation of being grabbed. As I hurried out the door and lept off the porch, I can only describe the feeling as one you get when you feel you are being chased, where the hair on your neck is on end and you swear at any moment you'll feel their claws upon you. To this day, I don't know if I was just too fast, or he was too scared to actually grab me. I rode my bike straight home and never spoke to him again or went anywhere near his house.

The incident was strange indeed, those were the things we also thought were fascinating and cool. While I felt uneasy for a time, I quickly forgot about it and didn't consider it something to tell my parents about. In fact, they'd of likely gotten mad at me for going into his house in the first place and turned it into somehow being my own fault. Anyway, after a couple years we moved and I forgot about him entirely.

Now, she had never told anyone. She also said several other kids she knew in the area had been abused by him as well. I had forgotten all about the memory until she brought it up, but it was still there, crystal clear. The most chilling part was when she told me how he had also lured her inside his house while his mom was at work, by claiming he had something she liked inside. Apparently, she had gone far enough inside to his actual room, whereas I had only come into the living room, since she is 5 years younger and had her own separate group of friends she played with but apparently one lived across the street from him

1353438890.0,13ituq,Meeting with a serial killer?,CoreMcClair,259,33,30,"Age: I was 20

Gender: female

Setting: a motorway in the south west/ west midlands of England

So I was what was known at the time as a 'crustie' though I read that they're called gutter punks in the US. I had dreadlocks, and we were as aggressive a bunch of heavy drinking thieves as you'd be likely to meet anywhere in the uk at that time.  For this reason I was fearless; but youth and a safe upbringing made me stupid when I thought I was streetwise.

As was my habit

I remember waiting for my next lift at a service station when this battered old 3 wheeled van pulled up. It was filthy and didn't look very pleasant but it was going in my direction so I was pleased. The driver seemed ok

He was distinctive looking. This was the start of the 90s but he looked like my dad did during the 70s, he was also v tanned like he worked outdoors a lot. He was lean, with dark eyebrows. I remember him so well because he looked like my dad and also my uncle. Maybe this was why I didn't feel less at ease with him.

So we start along the motorway and it all seemed fine. I was probably chatting like an idiot as usual and I remember glancing in the back of the van and seeing a heap of junk in there, he was more childcatcher than friendly clown.

Along the road a bit and he started asking me how often I hitch and I let him know it's routine for me. He says 'but don't you get scared' so I say 'no

'you must get scared'

'no I really don't'

'why don't you get scared?' 

'I can handle myself'

And so he goes on, but mostly annoyed because the conversation is going in circles.  Eventually, when he asks why I reply:

'I don't get scared because I carry a knife' (this was true

Well that stopped the line of questions

Oh! I was surprised and a bit pissed off to be left here but I got out and grumbled to myself as he drove off. Cars aren't allowed to stop on the hard shoulder and people certainly aren't allowed to walk along it but what could I do? I stuck my thumb out and started to walk. 

About 15 minutes later a police car pulled up and told me off for being there but kindly gave me a lift across to the far side of Birmingham to a safe and legal hitching spot where I was picked up by a minibus full of pagan students who took me right to the traveller site. 

Years went by, got a job and the only time I thought about this guy was when exchanging hitching stories with people. (This was my second favourite story behind the one about the Christian who drove at 100mph on the wrong side of the road because 'god will save me' whilst I screamed 'I'm an atheist, he won't save me!'  After I would tell that story, I'd mention the 'mad puppeteer' and his annoying questions.)

It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I realised the possible danger I had been in. I was watching a show called crimewatch on the bbc where they appeal for information and they had a special on the serial killer Peter Tobin, the time matched.  Just how he looked in the late 80s, early 90s. Just how he looked when he murdered hitchhiker dinah mcnicol on 1991. 

I work for the criminal justice system so I have level headed colleagues (mostly!) and told people at work. They agreed I should ring the crimewatch number. If it was nothing it could do no harm

I rang the crime watch number and said 'it's probably nothing but...'

A few days later they rang back and arranged to take a statement. A police officer came to my house and wrote down everything.  A few days later a second officer came to my workplace to get more info and to photocopy a diary i kept back then (frustratingly i said nothing about this lift in the diary! That's how little i thought i was in danger).  The crimewatch website updated to mention the three wheeled van and now is reported in some biographies as fact.

People ask me now if I truly believe that was Peter Tobin who gave me that lift.  I can never be sure. But i think in my mind I'm 75% sure I survived a serial killer. At the very least

Unable to have children me and my husband adopted a small Yorkie named Daisy. She was practically a child to us. We spent just as much money on her as we would have on a child. She always got new clothes

Now when we rented our house it didn't have a fenced in backyard so it was difficult having to leash her every time she needed to go out to potty. She has a tiny bladder and needs to go almost every house. Not wanting to do major work on a house we were just renting we put up a small fence around a small area that also allows her to go up on the deck. The fence is only about thigh high and it's just a mesh fence. 

One morning I had let Daisy out, micro-chipped, AKC registered, etc. She is a very expensive dog and lots of people knew I had her. The police took a report but again told me there wasn't much they could do since it was a dog. If you haven't noticed the police around here are shitheads and refuse to do anything that isn't black and white. They don't do grey areas. I spent the rest of day bawling my eyes out, I'd called my husband and he told me to calm down. Over the next week we plastered flyers everywhere. A week and half goes by and I am more than distraught when I receive a text from Courtney.

""I found your dog!""

I knew at this point she had to have been the one who kidnapped my dog. There was no way it was just a coincidence she found my dog. I texted her back

""Where?! Can you bring her to me now?""

""Yes

Luckily at this point my common sense kicked in so I chose a very public place to meet. We meet and she actually has Daisy. She hands her over

""No thank you? I found your fucking dog and you can't even THANK ME?! I made you who you are and I rescued your ""child"" and you can't even thank me. You're a fucking bitch. I hope you rot in hell and I hope it's at my hands.""

""Look Courtney

I left. I never let Daisy outside again without keeping a very close eye on her. The stalking however continued. She would sit outside my house and just stare. I'd call the police but she'd been gone when they got there. They still told me they couldn't do anything. I told them she had threatened me recently but again I was told I had no proof since it was verbal. Over the next month she continued to follow me everywhere I went. She'd text from blocked numbers. The usual shit she'd been doing.

One day I'd be out since early morning running errands and came home and my power was off. I was terrified but the rational part of me said that it was just the breaker. It wasn't. I called the power company and they told me that I had requested the power shut off earlier that week and they had sent someone out that morning. I promptly told them that it was not me. Unfortunately it was late and they couldn't send anyone out to turn it back on. I called my husband who was away on a job and told him. There was no way I could sleep alone with the power out and that crazy bitch lurking somewhere. I booked a hotel for the night and took my dog. That night at the hotel was a changing point. Why the hell was I living my life like this? I was afraid to let my dog out by herself, but nothing else. She was charged and got 30 days in jail. They charged her with a misdemeanor instead of a felony because she was a first timer. I was pissed. 30 days for the torture she put me through? Even still I had hoped it was a wake up call for her and she'd stop. 30 peaceful days come and go. I had really hoped she'd stop. But that wasn't going to happen.

She came to my house the day she was released. She just drove by ever so slowly. At this point I knew it wasn't going to stop until I took a stand. My husband was off that entire week so we decided to go buy a gun. I've always been against having a gun or one in the house so for me to ask my husband to purchase one was very out of character for me but I was fed up. I was tired of feeling helpless and defenseless. It took me a month and half to get a concealed weapon permit and a gun. And during this time she'd still been stalking me relentlessly. The day I got my gun was the day I decided to take a stand. The next day she drove to her usual stalking spot and just stared. Today I was prepared. I unloaded my gun. I wasn't going to shoot this girl. That wasn't my plan I just wanted her to know I was fed up. I walked outside and stood directly in view of her with my gun at my side. I yelled at her that I wasn't going to take it anymore. And it was going to stop. She sped off. I stopped seeing her everywhere

To this day I am wary around every new person I meet ""Is this going to be the new Courtney?"". I still look over my shoulder waiting on her to come back.

She threatened me only once but towards the end I definitely was scared of her. She'd escalated and I was sure she was going to escalate further. It was terrifying experience for me

What I did is controversial and not suitable for everyone. If anything getting a gun and doing what I did shouldn't be done. You should try every other method to ending the solution before it comes to that. I got a gun because I no longer knew what to do. The police wouldn't help and I felt more threatened every day. I know she is capable of further harm.

If anyone has any questions feel free to ask me. I'll answer everything I can.

Around 11PM, he goes in and tells me that someone was following him and telling him ""you're dead, i'm going to kill you son of a bitch"". I watched outside again for 10, 20, 30 seconds but nothing happened. Suddenly, when the motion light turned off, i saw that huge guy, like if he knew what he was doing. I looked at the house door just waiting for the guy to try to open it. 2 seconds later

He kept on slamming against the door again and again. We ran upstairs and locked 2 doors behind us before locking ourselves in my room where i called the cops. I tell the policeman what was happening. The cop could even hear the guy destroying my door on the phone so i told them to hurry the fuck up. My friend and I were totally scared because we didnt know the guy at all, the other doors in my house would take 1 blow each. For 5 minutes, the stranger kept on hitting my door and then total silence. I cannot see the front door from my room and i was even too scared to look outside. The only thing i could see were the motion lights turning off and on all around the house for another 10 minutes. After that, everything was silent and dark but i was sure the guy was still there cause there is only one way out of my property. I immediatly thought that he managed to get in the house by breaking a window at the back of my house. 

The police took around FORTY minutes to arrive at my house, the three guys actually opened my front door from the inside and told us to stay locked cause there was a broken window and the guy was maybe in. It took them another 10 minutes to find the guy, who was hiding in the bathroom upstairs in the god damn closet like in the movies. They arrested him after a brief fight. The guy was actually drunk as hell and had no idea where he was or what he was doing here, and told them he was just hiding there because he was scared. 

I didn't sleep for a week.

EDIT : some of you suggested that they would have been to scared to make a move. I don't know how to explain what occured in my mind but when we were waiting for the cops, not knowing that he was just a drunk guy but a potential murderer, i was ready to kill the guy with my hands to protect my life and my friend.

This happened to me several years back.  I was living with a friend at the time and was en route back to my apartment from a night with my family.  I was kind of in a foul mood and was out of cigarettes

This gas station was dingy.  I mean, I was seriously in need of cigarettes, so I stopped.

I got out of my car, and made my way to the counter, only to notice that there was no one standing there.  I'd stopped by this gas station before and had the same thing happen, figuring they were either in the bathroom or at their house (the employees were all part of a family who lived on the premises) so I hung around for a few minutes.  Soon enough, the door to the restroom flew open and out lumbered a rather angry looking female.  She rang me up for the Gatorade, gave me attitude when I said I wanted cigarettes (which I totally didn't understand, like, sell when someone wants something!)

I walk over to my car and notice the one overhanging light that had been on when I got out of my car was now off.  Not thinking much of it, I figured I was kind of in a hurry so it was possible.  I got in, started my car, lit a cigarette, and kind of blindly backed out while opening my gatorade.  I recapped the bottle, put it in the seat next to me, and was about to pull out onto the road when a hand reached out from the back seat.

Panicked, the man said, ""Don't fucking turn around if you know what's good for you.""  I sat facing forward and asked him what he wanted.  He said he wanted a ride somewhere.  My phone was in my booksack on the floor of my passenger seat, too far to grab discretely.  I asked him where he wanted to go.  He gave me directions to a well known crack alley about four miles from where we were.

I'd been to the area before.  I used to deliver pizza in that part of town before switching to a (relatively) safer delivery area, but it seemed like every time I did his face was encompassed by shadows.  We got to the place he wanted to go and he rolled the window down, yelling out some guy's name.  That guy came over to my car and sold this intruder some drugs through my back window, the whole time talking about ""that scared honky in the front seat.""  After about 15 minutes, they were done.

Once the dealer walked away, but I went anyway.  I just wanted him to get out of my car.

As we drove back, which meant that there was a significant paved shoulder over that ditch.  He had me pull over there and turn off the car.

""Do you believe in God?""

My heart started racing.  ""I'm not sure.""

""If you died tonight

""I don't know.  I'd like to think so.""

""Close your eyes.  Put your hands on the steering wheel

Trembling

""Now count.""

""What?""

""Are you fucking deaf?  I said count.""

So I did.  I started counting

I could tell he was shifting in the back seat.  I figured this was it.

Then he simply got out of the car and ran off.

I kept counting.  I counted to at least a thousand before I felt it might be okay to look up.  I didn't want to look up to him standing in front of my car waiting for me to disobey.  When I did look up

I sped off toward my apartment, they said there was nothing they could do -- I didn't have a description of the guy, other than he was a male.  I thought he might be black, because I think that was the color of the skin I saw when I initially started to turn around, but it was so fleeting that I couldn't be certain.  He didn't take anything out of my car or leave anything.

I learned a few things that day.  One, EVER leave my car unlocked.  Two, I always check my car before I get into it.  Three, I'm never stopping at that gas station again (I no longer live there, so that helps).  Four, if someone still somehow manages to get into my car to try something like that again, I'm running full speed into the nearest light post.  I'll be wearing a seat belt,,False,t3_urmj7

""Hey little girl

I tried to disengage and leave but he actually drove his car partially in front of me as I walked forward to leave

I asked him why he was trying pick my up to see my parents as I could see the cars in the driveway, He gestured to his dashboard, In which was an obviously half melted and gross lollipop covered in whatever debris was on his dash in an attempt to get me into the car as a last ditch.

""Oh,  you want this lollipop?, Get in the car and I will give it too you and we can go see your parents""

I Pretty much panicked at that point and RAN all the way home

It may be a bit of a creepy ending but less than two weeks after that incident was riding my bike down the street when I saw the exact same pick-up cruising down the street and it stopped when it saw me.

I was at my first ""real"" concert, but it seemed fun). Old men had started to become interested in me the year before, and it really freaked me out. They would stare at me in the grocery store while I was with my mom and this was before I had gotten the balls to start death glaring adults. 

Anyway, so we started to walk around. It was an outdoors venue, and we had lawn seats, so we walked around the hill, people watching and talking. We stopped just outside the crowd to sit on this railing that was maybe three feet high from the ground, but there was a rather large ditch behind it, putting us six or so feet up from that side. I was facing my cousin and all of a sudden somebody grabs me from behind, and then pulls me back up

He was a typically creepy guy. I know a lot of creeps dress normally, his hair was scraggly and curly, he was missing some teeth, and he reeked of alcohol, clearly incredibly drunk. I froze up, but my cousin, who had always been a bad ass, yelling at him about touching any girl

The guy was so drunk that he started off laughing, hoping I wouldn't upset him. My cousin could obviously tell I was terrified though, so she kept going, telling him to just leave. We tried walking away, but he followed us. 

Honestly, ""You're just jealous that your friend's cuter than you, that's why you cut yourself."" My cousin wasn't a cutter, but I was, and she knew that, and she freaked out. She was screaming about how I was only 12, that he shouldn't make fun of mentally ill people, and she thought she was a lot tougher than she (to be specific

I'm glad that they were so loud, moving in between us and them. I remember one of the guys started pushing the creep, and the other turned around and told my cousin to go back to our friends, but she was so enraged I don't think she even noticed. My most vivid memory of the entire situation is this guy, mid-twenties, just trying to enjoy a concert, looking me straight in my terrified twelve-year-old eyes and saying in the nicest voice in the middle of all of this chaos, but take your friend and go

1331118099.0,qllli,{MY} The quiet boy in my Senior English class had a lot different plans for his life than anyone expected.,klunkie,255,32,63,"I have been reading these for a few days and decided since I was awake in the middle of the night I will tell you guys about the boy in my English class. 

I went into class the first day of school and there was this new guy that I had never seen before, not super smart, super athletic, or super popular. Just a regular student trying to finish school and go on with my life.


My teacher did a seating chart on the first day of class and I ended up sitting right next to this new kid. We didn't talk much other than ""hey, she would start belittling me in class and say terrible things. John ALWAYS stood up for me every time our teacher went on her tangents. I started skipping class and what not like normal high school kids do. Until one day I had a death in my family, I was out of school for about a week and a half. My mother had told our school administrator about the situation but I'm guessing the memo wasn't passed onto my English teacher. When I got back to school It was my first class of the day. My teacher TORE ME A NEW ONE, she was screaming at me and calling me lazy and how i would never amount to nothing. I ran out of the room crying and called her a bitch. While I was gone John tore into her  standing up for me again and he told her why I was gone. I don't know exactly what was said or done while I was gone because i refused to go back into class that day. The next day after everything cooled down I thanked John and I had a lot of respect for him. It meant a lot to me that someone would stand up for me. 

The rest of the year goes on like normal, then one day I turn on the news and hear about how this guy was murdered in my area of town, a few days later the news is talking about another murder. They found the guy and when they showed his picture, I was in total disbelief, It was John. He went on a murderous rampage and killed 2 guys and shot and wounded another. 

Here is a link to one of the news articles about him. It is still crazy for me to think that this kid who stood up for me and defended me is now facing 2 life sentences in prison.

""Sup man. I'm headed out of town for the night
I knew exactly what this entailed. I was to walk the five blocks to his old residence; a mutual friend's house, search until I found it, leave the money, and be on my merry way. simple right?
Nope
The walk started off sketchy enough, the only sound coming from the highway some distance away. I'd walked this walk before, even at this hour, but I couldn't shake this anticipation in my gut.
I reached the house
Tonight though
This could have been a number of things. Maybe he had other friends over? brought a girl home? getting a late night snack? I quickly reassured myself as I stepped through the door into the pitch black garage.
I closed the door behind me and got to searching. The garage is separated into an upstairs and a downstairs to save space. Upstairs, forming a cave like lair. Not going to lie, It felt like a robbery simulator, rummaging through my friend's garage unannounced, looking for drugs. My heart began to race at the thought.
It really started racing though
Now, and I'd be on my merry way.
That's when I realized something...
My friend is does not own a single pair of boots...
In a split instant, so escape was not an option. I had to hide it out...
I was so confused...
I felt like I was in a slasher movie, grunting and taking heavy, labored breaths. They stopped at the top of the stairs, never making their way down though. Soon enough, they made their way back into the house, slamming the door behind them.
As soon as the door clicked, tucked away in my bed, every single light in the house on for the rest of the night.
I wasn't about to get the cops involved with the situation
I awoke to two texts in the morning. The first was a message from my dealer friend asking me if I was alright. The second was a text from the friend who owned the house

1375951096.0,1jy14q,Lost in Alexandria,shamr0ck_,270,48,28,"Hey Reddit
I'm a male living in Johannesburg, and I often think they should be.

I've never had much of a hard time in South Africa, of course, until one night where I happened to be lost.

South Africa is full of townships. They're basically settlements for anyone living at a level of poverty so appalling it makes the American ""sponsor an African"" videos look like ""sponsor a Kardashian"". I'm not even kidding. Here are some pictures for context.

[Alexandria

[This gives a good idea of townships in general](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/2/21/1298289285649/Khayelitsha-Township-in-C-007.jpg)

[And one last one](http://aestheticsofadailylife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/townships-1.jpg)


One of these townships, big houses, etc., and a good friend of mine lives there. When I was 18, just having gotten my license, I decided I'd pop through to his house after going to a party with a few others. I didn't really know the way all too well if I wasn't leaving from my house, but I knew the basic idea was that if I didn't go on the freeway I'd have to go through Alexandria. And being an idiot I figured that'd be just fine. I knew the area was dangerous as hell but getting lost didn't cross my mind.

And so I arrive. It's dark as hell. There aren't any street lights, hoping it'd take me to where I was going, but as time wore on I noticed Linboro Park (the area I was talking about earlier) fading away, so I pulled a few funky turns. Taking a left, I catch something in my headlights that scares me shitless.

This dude who looks like a hobo -- beanie

Keep driving and start heading down the way I came and I'm starting to regret coming here. Still no street lights, and they all eyed me out. I probably should've mentioned this earlier for context:

White people do not go to Alexandria. That's not me being racist, and it's just not normal to see a white person there. Furthermore, my car was a black BMW 325Ci, which is a pretty awesome car amongst the South African community and I'd had a lot of people warning me that I'd be specifically targeted for hijacking or whatever, but I always shrugged it off because I never had any reason to care. My car also had a tendency to overheat. 

Back to topic. I drive past a group of guys all sitting around a fire in a trash can and as I drive past they turn to look at me. I'm taking it pretty slow. Two blocks down I'm in a dead street and my car's heat gauge heads over into the red. The only word going through my head is ""fuck, be it from fires or electricity in my rearview. It didn't look like anyone was around so I felt okay, but I knew I'd have to wait a good 20 minutes before starting my car up again.

I went outside and started checking the engine and fumbled my phone about to get some light. I started doing random shit to try and handle the heat problem like open the bleeder. My phone had about 30% battery still but it cut out for no damn reason while I was using the flashlight on it. So no phone. No car. In Alexandria. 

Then I hear something which makes me shit myself. Not like a sudden ""AH!"" fright, so I hear that clanking sound while it rubs against the tar. Now that's a pretty obvious sign that he's not just gonna stop to say hello, and I'm shitting myself. On the bright side I have had a lot of weird/violent confrontations and ""almost getting mugged"" so I'd handled it before...it's just that this time I was in the middle of nowhere and I was basically a fucking pariah.

So I stand there. Stupidly. And then I figure my only option is to make a friend. So as he gets close, and then I'd have no car. And if I stayed I risked both, but fuck it. I put on a big smile, put my hand out for a handshake and say ""Hey what's up buddy! How's it going? Don't worry about the car, just a little bit of a heat problem.""

He looks a little confused and kind of pissed off and I'm almost certain he's just gonna whack the shit out of me with the pole, really glad to be a smoker, and I ask him for his name. He kind of grunts ""Xlepo"" or one of those weird clicking names as he grabs a cigarette, and when I light it for him I see his eyes are bloodshot as hell and overall he just looks like a man in...not good health. 

I take a look at his pole and ask him about it. Y'know, because I just get a terrible fucking vibe from being here, and from this gentleman now leaning against my car. ""Oh well you can feel safe here,"" I say, and I try and put some...I don't really know how to say this...I try to make it sound scary. Which I can do pretty well, my voice is pretty commanding. But at this point I actually want to scare him enough that he'll back off. 

I think it worked
And I smile and say ""I've got a gun on me"" and I lift my shirt up a bit at the back where he can't see it.
On the inside I have a mix of emotion. Half of me is high fiving the shit out of me because I think it's actually working, or just get pissed off. But he looks at me and I can tell he's a little freaked out, and he starts making small talk while we finish our cigarettes. He asks what I'm doing in Alex. Fair question. I tell him I got lost and leave it at that. I feel a little bit calmer now. He kills his cigarette and I really want to check my car now, but I'm not stupid enough to turn my back and look at my engine while he stands there.

I shake his hand and say, but it's not safe here. I think you should go."" It was such an act on my part that I can't believe I pulled it off. But he says okay and walks away, pole in hand, and when I see he's gone I turn back to my car and take the biggest fucking sigh of relief ever.

Now, my story doesn't stop there, but I'm not writing a book and I'm over 1500 words in, so I'll leave it at that for now.

It was 12 years ago and my boyfriend at the time had just finished playing a show.  My girl friend and I were waiting outside in the parking lot for him so we could leave.  He came walking up to us with his friend and another dude that he had just met.  The new guy said he was throwing a party at his house and invited us to come

The drive out took a really long time, it seemed like he was taking us in circles and making odd, frequent turns through neighborhoods.  It was obvious that he didn't want us to remember how to get there, fair enough.  But we were worried that we weren't going to remember our way home.

We ended up turning onto a long stretch of dirt road and eventually pull up to this huge mansion in the middle of nowhere.  It was pitch dark out and there were no lights lit on the property, but it was already the early morning so that didn't seem right.  He wanted to show us around the property a bit, he took us back to what looked like large barn that they have on fairgrounds.  He opened the side door and we walked in.  I remember there being a long row of empty stalls for horses and in the center there was what looked like an indoor horse arena.  It was pretty cool but there was barely any lighting so it was very spooky at the same time.  

He opens up the door to the house and lets us all in.  The house was massive inside with a beautiful double staircase, though he didn't want to turn the lights on for some reason.  So, aside from some dim light from a few night lamps, it was very hard to see.  He walked us through the house, but said that we had to keep it really quiet.  He pointed to a bedroom door and said he was watching his younger siblings while his parents were out of town and didn't want to wake them up.  He made us wait while he checked on them.  He went in the room, came out, and said that they were fine and still sleeping.  I remember thinking it was pretty shitty that he left them there alone, while he went to the show.

We then go down to the main level where there was a full stocked bar and get a small party going.  There was just about any type of liquor you could imagine and he said we could have as much as we wanted.  So, so me and my bf decided to explore the basement a bit.  

We found a room in the back that was empty except for a bed, I heard something weird outside of the door and what sounded like heavy breathing, like somebody was listening to us.  We stopped and my bf called out, but nobody answered.  Then the doorknob started rattling like someone was trying to get in and they began pounding really hard on the door, almost like trying to break it down.  My bf yelled something and it stopped, but still, nobody answered.  He jumped up and opened the door, but they were still in the same exact spot doing their thing.  We asked them if they saw the dude and they said they hadn't.    

My bf and I walked upstairs to look for the guy and find out what was going on.  We saw that the door to the room where the ""kids were sleeping"" was open.  We looked in the room and it was completely empty.  No beds, I was beyond freaked out at this point.  We ran downstairs and told our friends that we had to leave right away, that it was an emergency.  We got the hell out of there as fast as we could without looking back and fortunately didn't run into the guy on the way out. 

Still to this day

When I was younger I'd go to the supermarket with my parents but I'd just sit and read in the car with the window cracked open just a bit. I believe I was 12 at the time of this particular occurrence

As I was reading

I'm not a very assertive person and I was even less so back then. I knew that you weren't supposed to talk to strangers or anything so the situation felt kind of weird but I couldn't help but feel like saying no was being rude. I mumbled and stalled and looked around and noticed a man sitting in his car about two spots down to the left of mine. He was sitting in his driver's seat and was watching the whole thing. We locked eyes (or I thought we did at least

I turned back to the guy at my window and said, ""that's alright, thanks anyway."" After he left I more or less blocked the instance from my memory except for occasionally when it resurfaces randomly. At the time I really just felt like I turned down an odd but not necessarily bad man, but looking back at it, nothing about that situation would have ended well if I had opened my door. Sometimes I wonder about what would have happened if that other person wasn't there.

When i was 18 i spent a lot of time in the Cohutta wilderness. My favorite spot was a set of waterfalls several miles from the nearest parking area. Most visitors just parked in the RV area and swam in the creek right along the gravel road

Anyway

I assured her everything was safe (the only thing id ever had to worry about in my part of the woods are the occasional bear or copperhead). We continued on but she could never shake the feeling of being watched

A couple hours later we finally reach the end of the trail and had a picnic at the bottom of the falls.  After we finish eating she tried to check her cell phone for messages and started to panic when she realized we had no service. I explained to her that there was no cell reception anywhere around for miles

We started heading back almost immediately because she was clearly scared and i couldn't help but smile thinking it was silly. On the way back i explained to her how many times id been out there all alone and never had any problems but she still couldnt shake the feeling of being watched. 

We were about a mile from the falls on the only trail around when we heard someone call from behind.  I jumped nearly out of my skin and turned to see a man walking toward us. He had a rifle slung over his shoulder and a heavy beard with his hat tipped low. She took a small step behind me.

""What can i do for ya?"" I asked
""You guys left your cell phone back by the falls."" He said
""Oh thanks for the assist."" I said extending my hand. He shook his head and told me he didn't bring it

We politely declined and made our way back down the trail as quickly as we could with him following us on the trail several feet behind. He followed us all the way back to our car and she showed me her cell phone when i opened her door.

I haven't been back to that particular trail since then.

TL;DR. We reached dead end of trail and made our way back

You had to be a member and each member was assigned a member id. You could buy a friend or guest pass. During the summers on Friday night we had what was called ""Friday Night Cheers"" where we would have a band play

As it was getting close to closing I started to go around and clean up all the tables. The diving board guy started to follow me around and make small talk. I'm a very friendly person so I started having a conversation with him. He tells me his name and that he is 19 and home from college. He then asks me for my number. I tell him no

A couple days later I'm working and he's there again. We aren't suppose to talk to people while on duty but he won't go away so I start to ignore him. He stops talking but just kind of hangs out in the water right by me. A guy I work with comes to take my spot so I can go relieve another guard at another station. The guy follows but I ignore him. This continues everyday. 

One day I get a text from a number that I don't know. I ask who it is and its the guy from the pool. The only way I can think that he got my number is from our schedule that hangs in the guard shack right by the door which is always open. I tell him he needs to stop texting me and following me around. The texts stop but he continues to come to the pool everyday and follow me. I finally tell my manager and she says the next time he comes in they will make sure he really is a member; sometimes people will give their friends their member number if they know a picture isn't attached to it on the computer. So he comes in and they ask for an id. It doesn't match the information on the computer and his id says he is 27. I don't know why but they let him in anyway. He comes over to me and as soon as he gets five feet away my manager comes over and tells me to go take my break. I come back fifteen minutes later and she had kicked him out. Id never seen him since. I know its not as bad as other peoples experiences but it really pissed me off that he just would not leave me alone.

  This happened about a year ago, ex-football player, I’m in my late 20’s, I live in a nice neighborhood in Arizona. Needless to say I don’t have much to fear at night.  I had 2 roommates living with me at the time so there always seemed to be someone home with me at night. I got home late from a business trip around midnight, came into the house, exhausted and dropped everything and went to bed. I am a heavy sleeper so it takes something loud to wake me. 

  Then around 3am I hear a loud “Ghetto Knocking” on my door, it must be them, they are messing with me. I arrive at my front door and look through the peep hole and see a young woman, homeless looking but actually kind of cute. She had a really baggy sweatshirt on with jeans and a beanie. 

  Might I remind you this is Arizona in the dead of summer, almost like she was being chased, so I was just going to open the door and make sure she was ok but then she started laughing, like a scary laugh. Which this stopped me in my tracks then she proceeded to yell “I need to pee let me in!” Over and over for a good 5 minutes. I just stood behind the door in silence watching this through the peephole, I wasn’t scared at this moment, I was annoyed about to yell at her to get out of here, then all of a sudden she just turns and hopscotched down my driveway like a child. Just thought to myself this girl is wacked out on drugs or something.

  I go back to bed. 30 minutes later I’m just about to fall back asleep and that same “Ghetto Knock” happens again. I’m furious at this point, he is looking into the peephole yelling “YO my girl has to pee let us in.” Now I’m a little freaked out, not going to lie. I have seen a lot of situations like this in horror movies, so I just back away from the door, go to the kitchen grab a knife, go back to my room and sit in my closet. Lol, I figured if they were going to break in at least they wouldn’t see me at first in the closet and I could launch a counter attack.

  2 hours pass, it startles me awake, my bedroom is on the first floor and is accessible from the back yard. The lights are off so I creep over to the window and push aside slowly one of the blinds. It’s the women peering into my bedroom but not looking directly at me just subtly tapping the window. And off in the distance was the guy butt ass naked doing cannonballs into my pool! I instinctively without thinking yell, “Hey get out of my pool!” (so dumb lol) Which brings her attention straight to me, we make eye contact, we are inches away from each other and eyes wide opened, had the scariest smile, I fear for my life please send someone. Went into my bathroom locked the door just waiting for the “Here’s Johnny!” moment to happen. Dispatcher informed me cops where their but no one was outside the house. They must have ran off into the alley when the cops showed up. 

  The next day I see neighborhood watch fliers all over informing us that over the past 3 nights 6 homes had been broken into, I sleep great now. But that look on that women’s face still haunts my dreams. [put up some pictures to help depict the scene better](http://imgur.com/a/8hcBq#0)",,False,,t5_2t3t8,1376599947.0,,

My siblings and I are pretty spaced out age-wise. My older sister was born 9 years ahead of me, a girl, now 21, but at the time, I was 7-12/13.

When my sister was in high school, since my dad was a deadbeat. That's another story entirely. My sister ended up pretty much raising myself and my brother. She also started dating a dude named Brad.

Brad seemed really nice at first. I was 7

They moved in together pretty quickly despite their age, she had a job and shit to take care of, even when I was there, so sometimes I would sit with Brad in his computer room. She would completely break down if she knew what happened when she left me alone with him.

It started out normal. We would play computer games and laugh at stuff online. Then, so I really didn't know what was going on.

He started getting really touchy, but I was scared of him.

When I was 11 or 12, but when I pointed it out to my sister later, she said it was ""because he hadn't seen me in so long and I looked so grown up"" and that he wasn't looking at my chest, just at me in general.

Finally, and several emails to his friends saying how badly he wanted to have sex with me, and how he ""hoped I would resist"", as well as multiple rape and underage porn sites in his browsing history.

To describe my disappointment would be impossible - I was 14, telling me it wasn't going to happen.  As she went back inside, I walked away, trudging back towards my house.  But as I walked, the idea hit me: why not just go myself?  I had the money.  I could just get on the bus myself, and go to the mall.

The driver shook his head and informed me that he didn't go that far.  What's more, I had caught the last bus leaving the mall for the day, and that by the time he got me to the transfer station to catch the right bus, the buses would be done running.  I put on a brave face, so I agreed that that was fine. 

He dropped me off where we had discussed, I went inside and bought myself a hot cocoa.  Armed with my cocoa, I started the trek home.  

About 1/4 mile into the walk, though, and continued on resolutely.  Just as I crossed the tracks, an oncoming red Econoline van (I will never forget this vehicle) slowed to a stop and the driver rolled down his window.  He gave me a friendly smile and say ""Hey sweetheart, need a ride?""

Now, but I knew with every fiber of my being that taking a ride from strangers, and this particular stranger especially, was a very bad idea.  I tried to smile casually and waved vaguely ahead at a house nearby.  ""Nah,"" I said, ""I just live over there.""  He looked back at the direction I was indicating, looked at me and shrugged.  ""Alright, ""but it's awfully cold out here.""  I just laughed and waved goodbye.  He pulled away and drove off.  Moments later though, but he drove past me without slowing or even looking at me.  He turned the corner ahead  and I breathed a sigh of relief.  As I rounded the corner, his parking lights on.  I couldn't see in through the windshield

I've created this map to try to make it easier to follow the events.  [This is the actual scene of the situation](http://minus.com/lHJ7dVNQrIK3j) (though it looks a bit different here than it did 20something years ago).   The red circles are his positions and movements

I was already rounding the corner, as if I maybe lived in the back, and just stood there, trying to listen for signs of him driving away.  I was terrified, however, when I saw headlights lighting up the driveway that you see running alongside the house (leading to a business that was clearly not open) and sure enough, his van drove slowly into view.  I was frozen in fear.  He reached the end of the driveway, slowly heading up.  I could see him looking in my direction, and fled onto the front porch and hid.  I hid for what seemed like hours, I peeked over the railing and scanned for any sign of him.  I didn't see any

I still had over 1.5 miles to go before I got home, especially in my half-frozen condition.  The walk seemed to take forever, and at every sign of a vehicle larger than a car, I would duck behind a tree or hide behind a bush.  The entire time, I was mapping getaway routes.  ""If he catches up to me *here*, where would I go?""  I can honestly say I have never been so terrified in my life.

Less than a mile from home, and I dove behind a bush.  That I didn't pee myself when the driver slowed down is a wonder.  I heard the window go down, and amazingly, blissfully, I heard my mother's voice say ""Julie?!""  I stood up, and there she was, in our Ford Bronco

I say sure why not and hop in, he tells me to apply where he works. Over all, no biggie, he's just a weird guy. He drops me off near my place and we shake hands and I thank him. I actually said ""Thanks Dennis, you're a really good guy""

Years ago when I was in second grade (22 now) my parents one monday morning finally felt confidant in allowing me to come home from school by myself and stay home without a baby sitter until they came home. That morning my father gave me the house key

After school that day I came home

Around 5:00 that day I heard the doorbell ring. My dad told me never to answer the door by myself even if they were home. I walked to our family room where I could get a good view of who was there

After a third ring I saw him walk down the steps and assumed he was leaving. I went back to watching terminator when I noticed something outside my kitchen window. The man was walking in our backyard for some odd reason. I felt scared for my life since some stranger was on my property. I ran under the kitchen table and grabbed the cordless phone from the counter and proceeded to call my dad's work number.

My dad answered and I exclaimed how some strange man was in the backyard and was now proceeding to try and open our sliding door. My dad told me to stay where I was and call the neighbors

Before I could call my neighbors the man was able to somehow open our family room window. I feared for my life and ran to the bathroom and locked the door and called our neighbors. After about 30 seconds I heard my neighbor running through our house shouting my name to see if I was ok. She said how she saw no one in the house and we stayed in the bathroom until the police arrived.

The police conducted their investigation and told us they found some fingerprints that matched a recently released convict who was previously put in jail for breaking into homes.

After that day my parents did not leave me without a babysitter until I went to high school...every week I wonder what happened; did he run when he saw someone was in the house

Needless to say after that day and even after I was allowed to stay home without a babysitter I never stayed home alone. I was either at a friend's house or an after school program until my parents came home. I still feel unsafe being home alone.

She was at her doctor's office and I had opted to stay behind to read in the backseat. Luckily for me I was slightly paranoid as a child and I locked all the doors. 

About ten minutes after my mother went upstairs a station wagon pulled into the lot and screeched to a stop right behind my truck. Literally parked across the rear of the truck blocking it in. Out of the station wagon came a grey haired old man. He quickly came to my door and grabbed the handle. He never made eye contact with me. 

I froze in place. I felt like I couldn't do anything. He started shaking the handle violently and pulling on the door. It was an old truck so the door moved quite a bit. I was scared thinking the lock would fail or something.

It was then I remembered my mother had left her dead cellphone in the front seat. I grabbed the phone and made a show of pretending to make a call and the man looked up at me then ran back to his car and took off.

When my mother returned she took me to the police station and I gave them a description of the man and the car. They promised to call if they heard anything. 

About a week later an officer called and informed us the man had been caught. Apparently he tried to get two seven year old twin boys into his car and their father had seen it happening. The father ran up and hit the guy with a baseball bat while screaming at him to stay away from his kids. After the initial hit he grabbed onto the guy and had a passerby call the police.

If you've ever lived in an apartment, we had a pretty nasty ant invasion in our unit so of course, I called management and they sent a guy over really early one morning.

I was still asleep when he knocked on the door, a little stocky. Now, I had to piss like a horse as usual in the morning so I went to do that while he did his spraying and such.

So I go about my business while he's there, and I notice he gets this weird, happy little grin on his face.

We stop in the kitchen so I can sign his work order, because his eyes were also smiling and it was disconcerting. It was like a romantic expression, but with a look of desperation or expectancy-I couldn't tell, but felt uneasy so I signed the document quickly and let him out. 

As he said goodbye, like he wanted me to say something. He never said anything though, and after a very long 10-15 seconds I curtly said bye and shut the door.

Anyways, was a bit of a creeper, but he was doing it just to freak people out. Like, he would ask to smell your shoe. He just had a strange sense of humor. This other guy, Cliff, was who I thought was the creepiest. He was probably about 30, but he did acid and often came into work right after smoking weed. He was really friendly towards us girls, and he never yelled at me. He would talk to me a lot and eventually started asking for hugs. It was a bit creepy, it was never a sexual sort of hug. Looking back on it now, and he was like 30. The third cook was in his 40's

Anyways, my manager Jake, the other waitress Silvia, and me up in the front taking orders. At night we didn't have a busser because we never got too busy, so we had to put dishes into bus bins, and take them to the back ourselves. One of the bus bins were full, so I took it back. There is only one camera in the kitchen area, out of it's view. I got back there
Paul: ""Hey.""
Me: ""Hey.""
Paul: ""Doin' dishes?""
Me: ""Yup.""
Paul: ""Hey
I turn around to look at him. **HIS FUCKING DICK IS OUT.**

I just sort of stood there, never seen a penis in real life before. He was kind of blocking my way, and took a step closer, when all of the sudden I hear **""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?""**
It's Cliff, and Cliff comes up and asks if I'm alright, and said that if Paul touched me, he would kick his ass. At this point I'm crying, but Cliff is kind of making me laugh, telling me how he was going to cut Paul's penis off and stuff. 

Anyways, it was off camera, so there wasn't a lot of evidence. Paul was fired, and my boss asked if I would come back, but I declined. To this day, I really don't like being alone with older guys in a room. It freaks me out. I don't know what would have happened if Cliff hadn't showed up. I guess I kind of misjudged him. He was probably just a lonely, socially awkward, and I still haven't been back

So I am a total night owl

One trail is dark and goes right behind a long line of nice houses. they all have relatively big yards and since I walk the path frequently I know it very well.

One night a few weeks ago I was out at my usual time, but not being a peeping tom I just keep walking.

As I am walking down the path I look over and see a figure standing alone in a back yard and looking towards the house. I at first thought it was probably the homeowner but something seemed off. The guy had his hands in front of him and was just acting creepy.

I am a light walker and decide that perhaps I should investigate and walk over

This guy had evidently hit the goldmine and was having his own personal peep show. It also seemed like he was making sure he enjoyed himself if you know what I mean.

I walked quietly up behind him until I was about two feet away

""What are you doing?

I have never seen anyone jump as high as he did in my life. I had completely surprised him and he let out a yell and ran away at an angle around the front of the house and away from me.

The couple must have heard something because suddenly the drapes were closed to the room and I resumed my walk.  In hindsight, but I had followed my instinct and it all worked out.  I doubt I will ever see him again, I am pretty sure I scared the crap out of him.

So let's start from the beginning. My girlfriend and I had just broken up, and he was just being nice because I was always a good friend to his little sister. We made plans to dress up nice and go to a fancy dinner at the only classy restaurant
in our town. 

Everything went okay at first. He was polite, shit got weird. He started by placing his hand on my leg, just above the knee. I felt a little uncomfortable by the contact, but not to the point where I wanted to make a scene. I thought maybe he was just one of those people who liked physical contact. No warning signs yet. 

He turned to me and smiled. ""Let's go to the movies, figuring that he wouldn't try anything in a crowded theater. I sat through the entire movie, praying that he'd let me go home afterwards. Luckily, when the movie was over, he agreed to take me home. 

On the way back home in his car, he started to slide his hand up until rested on my inner thigh. I was in a dress that was long enough where I didn't need leggings, so his hands were on my bare skin. I looked over at him, he had the smile. All toothy, and whatnot. Creep. I pushed his hand away and he seemed to get the message, he didn't try touching me again.

When we got to my house I tried to gather all my things as fast as I could. I was so ready to go inside and forget that this whole date had ever happened. I was about to reach for the handle when he locked the doors. Oh. My. God. I felt like I was in a horror film. This isn't supposed to happen in real life. Creepy guys don't just lock you into their cars, and I wanted him out of my life.

""Artie, but I probably sounded like a scared little girl. That's how I felt inside anyway. He didn't say anything, he just climbed out of seat and got on top of me. Now let me tell you, this guy was heavy. He easily outweighed me by 100lbs, maybe more. The point is that I wasn't going anywhere. He pinned my arms down and started kissing my neck, down to my chest. I felt so helpless, I just started crying like a little pussy. I had no idea how I was going to get out of this. Why hadn't my mom come out to check on me? Artie and I weren't even 20 feet away from my house. 

Then he kissed me. Hard. He bit down on my lip hard enough to draw blood. That was my breaking point. I started screaming and kicking as much as I could. Making it as difficult for him to violate me as I could. I wasn't going to let this dude rape me. I bit down on his shoulder as hard as I could. He yelled and let me go. I turned and unlocked my door and fell out of the car. I ran into my house and locked the door and pulled all the curtains shut. My mom was waiting for me in the kitchen. I sat down at the table and started sobbing. I was on the verge of having a panic attack as I told my mother what had happened.

I ended up getting a restraining order on Artie, but I don't want to make this wall of text any longer. Maybe I'll post more later.

On the far right of the condos was a grassy/muddy slope that went down to the edge of the bluff, never mind the fact that there was an unlocked staircase right off the beach into the complex.

Suddenly, we just had a really awful feeling. The sound of the ocean made it hard to hear at first but as we fell silent, we could hear it clearly. It was breathing.

To give you some background: I'm generally not easily scared. I like to stretch my mind and see how far I can go. Zombie nightmares? No problem. Scary movies? I've watched them all. I did notice, uninvited, in my house - I freeze, can't move, can't scream, can't run. So I've been doing some thinking as to why that may be and I figured out why.

Honestly, and look towards my parents' room. Just then I see a silhouette of a person sprinting across my doorway, down the hallway. By the time my parents got out of their bed and person was already out of the house, leaving the large door to the house wide open.

This happened three fucking times.

We started getting preemptive. We got one of these motion sensors that play a recorded message when activated. My mom recorded a ""GET OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING THIEF!"" type message

That was the last time *that* happened. 

When I was 13 we moved to another country, in the living room and watch national geographic after everyone went to sleep. Dunno why, I find it very relaxing.

I was about 14, but just in case I put both of my hands up and middle-fingered the whole room slowly. I figured if anyone *was* watching me they would have gone away after seeing that. Heh...

""We're at Holy Cross Cemetery
We squealed. Holy Cross *was* 5 minutes away from the house. We flew downstairs and made sure all of the doors were locked. We decided not to wake my aunt and uncle yet, locked her door, clicked off her light, and stationed ourselves in her window seat among a mountain of stuffed animals. We waited, peering out of the little triangle window to the street below. Not two minutes go by, and we see headlights parked up the road, but we can't see a vehicle. Then, and a large black van came into view and parked two doors down from the house. Part of it felt like our imaginations were running wild
""What are they doing?"" I asked frantically. Jessie was frozen, we realize one of the men is on the sidewalk in front of us, holding her trashcan, looking at the house.  
We snapped into action. ""Send them an IM, hoping they would believe the whole house was awake. I started down the stairs toward the living room. I remembered there was a lightswitch panel for the living and dining rooms at the bottom of the stairs and was relieved because I was terrified to step foot down there. I flicked them and light flooded through the rooms downstairs. I heard voices from outside, muffled. Shouting. I ran back upstairs to Jessie's room and found her sitting in the window seat, sobbing.  
""He was walking toward the house when the downstairs lights went on. He yelled and another man ran from around the side of the house. They're gone.""  
We hugged and cried and didn't sleep that night. In the morning, 13 years later. I guess we thought we wouldn't be able to use the internet anymore, and we were probably right. I still get chills up my spine when I hear those three traumatic words, ""you've got mail.""",,False,,False,t3_wxhd5
1375728976.0,1jr9pp,When I was little a crazed man wanted to come into my house,blackholebirthday,248,37,15,"So this is my first Reddit post ever because I felt encouraged to share this story with all of you and thought that you might appreciate it.

I grew up in a very small town in Massachusetts. My family's first home was a tiny two bedroom house but it was idyllic and really nice; it was on a corner lot next to a busy street but there was a huge yard and a big natural pond in the back yard that my mom admiringly recalls in stories she used to tell us about families of deer walking across it frozen over in the winter time to feed on tree boughs hanging over the water. Next to the pond was a totally expansive wooded area.

I still remember what happened because especially for my small mind to process at the time this was really terrifying to me then and according to my mother I had recurring nightmares about this, so our days usually started very early. On one of these mornings my mom decided to take a shower before she did her other things typical of any day of the week. While she did that I played in the kitchen by myself on the floor. Our old kitchen was like a galley style and sort of narrow and at the end of the room directly ahead of me was our back door and a porch that my dad had built (which in retrospect was pretty high off of the ground because our house was built on a hill).

On this day I was playing and all of a sudden a man ran - ran as in dashed - onto the back porch and started banging at the door to be let in. We hadn't invited anyone over, and through the window in the door I could see him staring at me on the floor and then he started begging me to let him in.

I just sat on the floor probably in mild shock and stared back at him. This man didn't even look away once to see if he could flag down help elsewhere like passing motorists on the busy street around the corner if he so desperately needed it. He was raising his voice and he was asking me to come to the door and let him inside. Asking a child

He might have realized this because I wasn't moving and then all of a sudden he started demanding that I open the door. He was yelling things like ""c'mon kid just let me in"", and only dressed in just a towel she came out to see, and this is what gets me.

He jumps off of the back porch

I wonder sometimes what would have happened if I had let him inside the house if he sincerely needed help. Like maybe he was being chased and he wasn't actually the threat; crime never happens in our town, but I will never forget this.

1370298552.0,1fm195,Serial killer in the making...,chizzle91,255,44,22,"I used to work in a sex shop. I know how that sounds. And while

It is important to note, on a dead night I was the only living soul in the building. I know now how stupid and dangerous it was to accept a job where there isn't even a coworker let alone a manager with you at all times, given we were all young females and closed at midnight. Even though we weren't supposed to carry any type of weapons, I always had a pocket knife. Brilliant right? I was too young to carry a gun, but there was a guy that worked next door that was super nice and always came to help if we needed him. Customers getting rowdy? Call him and boom he'd come running. He lived about a block from the store so I always felt better about that.

That being said, just people constantly asking awkward questions. Again, I kind of expect that. However, about a month after I started working there, we started getting these weird phone calls every couple of weeks. A guy would call, say he had lost some sort of a bet, and had to do something ""humiliating."" Sometimes he had to mow his lawn in a pink bikini and high heels, etc etc. We assumed it was a prank caller and let it go at that. However after a certain amount of time, he had a pretty distinct voice.) 
The calls gradually became more and more frequent, go somewhere else, whatever I felt like saying at the time.

Where I worked, I would start off the calls trying to be hopeful knowing damn good and well where it would end up. 

Anyway, and he said he would be by that night to look at it. I got creeped out and asked the guy that worked next door to come sit with me until closing, which he did. 

When I brought this up to my manager, okay.

Moving on. The calls stopped. For about a week if I'm lucky. He began calling again saying he was going to come by sometime that night yadda yadda yadda. I started brushing them off as more of his prank calls. Until one night, and a guy walked in and said he had a strange question. My heart sank as soon as I heard him start talking. I immediately sat down behind the counter and refused to stand up and come out onto the floor. He said he had lost a bet, and had to ""parade around downtown dressed as a woman. Do we sell fake breasts?""

Great. I told him no, as serious as can be, if I knew where he could buy breast tissue. In my head I'm thinking ""Umm...a fucking morgue?"" But told him that's more than I can help him with. He looked around the store for a minute and left. Once again, I called the guy from next door and he came and sat with me. 

The next time I worked, he comes running up to the counter, and asked if we sold ""honeymoon kits."" I pointed to the corner of the store where they would be and sat right back down. He slowly circled the room, pretending to look at the merchandise. I was watching him on the security cameras, and noticed every time he would walk past one of our storage doors, he would lean in and listen. Holy shit he's making sure I really am alone in here. When he got back around to the counter, he reached in his pocket, and pretended to start talking to somebody and ran back out the door. Now, because now I know this guy is whacked. He was already gone. It's hard to explain the layout of the store

Figuring this has gone beyond asking a friend for help, I noticed a white SUV crawl through the parking lot right up against the building. 

Officer comes and goes, since I couldn't see the guys face for sure, I didn't call the police. At the time I thought that was a huge no no, making calls when you're not sure, although later they assured me given the situation I should have called. Sounds stupid now.

Anyway, actually a few months. Until one night I was in the car getting ready to go to dinner with my husband, when I get a phone call on my cell. I didn't recognize the number but I had recently gotten a new phone and wasn't sure if it was a deleted contact. So I answered and sure enough...it was him. 

Side note: I'm part of a website that offers ""spiritual counseling"" and whatnot. Don't ask just go with it....

He said he got my phone number from the website and wanted to know if I gave gender role counseling. I said I hadn't before but I'd give it a try and gave him the work email associated with that site, since I don't know where he got my number, I don't know if he knew my address, where I went to school, etc. Third of all, I'm now convinced this guy wanted to go all ""Buffalo Bill"" and wear my damn skin.

So, and give them the number. No clue what they did with it, but the calls stopped and I never saw the guy again. It's been a little over a year now and I don't even live in the same state anymore. Thankfully.

tl;dr - I was stalked by a wanna be Buffalo Bill.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1fm195/serial_killer_in_the_making/
1349253746.0,10v7fw,It started off as a compliment..,waterlanding,249,37,62,"Okay, so here is my stalker story. 

I used to work at a local ice-cream/burger place in my small town. Everything was great, etc. Customers (usually older people,) would often talk to me, ask me things like my name, age, and whatever else. After a while, two men started coming in, they would call me the usual hun, and hey
It got to the point where they would come in every time I was working, I stopped going upfront when I saw their car pull in, I'd stay in the back to make their food instead. 

One day, the new girl ran back the order the other person that was working. I was left upfront and the younger man started talking to me. Asking my name, age, where I was going to school. I answered them all, not really seeing the harm, I mean my town is so small I didn't even think twice (I know, stupid.) After this, I told him tennis. And he seemed overly interested. He then went on to tell me how he played tennis and would love to play against me sometime. I denied. He offered tickets to a tennis match, with his older friend behind him. 

They didn't come in for a couple of days,) and I can come over to his house and get it. Or maybe he could come pick me up, or wait for me after work and take me over. I decline, politely. Once again, he gets angry and leaves without his food or ice-cream. I wrote it off. 

The next day, never turns off, no one comes in. Whoever it is, just sits in their car, pointed at the drive-through. I was slightly unnerved but didn't really take it too seriously. Anyhow, me and the kid close up and we're getting ready to leave. And he starts walking a different direction. As I pass the car, I look into the window and there sits the younger man.. Which is weird because it was a yellow car, the head lights turn on me. At this point, it follows. It followed me until a cop drives by and then it immediately turns a different direction.
I quit my job there, I was walking at my college (a little community one,) and I see him. Standing there, staring, smiling that creepy smile. He waves, and I look away. The next week after my night class that ends at ten, he is waiting in the lobby. He says hi, and quickly start walking away. He gets up to follow. A guy from my class saw this and caught up to me and walked me to my car. Then last week

I got back into town where I basically ran a red light because I didn't want them to be close to me. They turned down an alley before the light. I get to my house, and what do I see? The same car, a beat up red car, slowed almost to a stop. I see the silhouette of the man in the car look in his rear-view mirror. A car comes up behind him and he turns into down an alley two house down. I get in my house and lock the doors. I then look outside my kitchen window (I live on an alley) to see the same car, with the younger man in it, driving down my alley.


I'm so scared, I cannot call back. I just don't know what to do. If I see him again, I think I'll call the cops. Or would that be overreacting? Could it be that he happens to go to my college too? Or did he go there because I told him that's where I was attending this fall. I am so paranoid because of all this, I never thought this would happen in a small town. 






UPDATE: As of 10/09 I thought I saw him outside my college last night but it was too dark to tell. Also last night I heard someone banging on my back door around one or two in the morning, she really doesn't take this whole thing seriously. I think I've been seeing him around town but I could just be going crazy from the paranoia. Thanks for all your advice and what not.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,1349819570.0,,
1348468650.0,10drsp,Morgan,this_isnt_happening,240,27,91,"This is a collection of stories about my older brother

First off, I can't remember how old I was when he started- basically these episodes intertwine with some of my first memories. It went on about once a week until I was about 11 or 12, around the same time I hit puberty. He apparently doesn't care for girls who have ""developed"". Ew. 

As for my little brother, though, so I can only imagine how often it happened with him. 

For a time, but by then we were better able to put our foot down.

My dad didn't know until we were all well in to adulthood. My mom caught Morgan and I once and punished him

He was extremely manipulative, because he didn't seem to care whether he hurt anyone else.

For instance, at which point he grabbed my hand hard- and broke it. I needed a cast going up to my elbow to keep my hand in place. I was 14, he was 17. Around that same time there were a number of violent incidents. Mostly throwing things at me, like logs from the fireplace or furniture. One time, he grabbed a machete from the fireplace (dad used it to chop wood) and chased me around the house. I used a stepladder to defend myself, which he hacked away at over and over. When I was able to get inside my room and lock the door, he hacked away at that, before losing interest. 

He wet the bed

Another indicator is animal torture, he took those puppies and dropped them off the second level of the barn. He did this in front of my little brother and I, and we were luckily able to catch them. The reason he was doing it was to upset us- I don't remember why, but I know it worked, because we were both screaming and crying and begging him to stop. 

Another time, all squirming around in a thick layer on the bottom of the tank, about half of them babies.

He just kept them. Tossed a few to the dogs

He managed to hit more than your average number of dogs once he could drive. One was a puppy who survived, after which she developed alcohol poisoning and was gravely ill for about a week. I took care of her, though my dad kept telling me I should just put her out of her misery. When it was over, she survived, but severely brain damaged. 

When he was 17 or 18, and was hiding in a nearby field and raiding our house for supplies during the day. My dad decided to barricade the house, but that would require one of us to stay home so we could put the boards in place.

I went first

About ten years ago, my piece of shit car broke down almost directly in the middle of this unlit stretch of cornfield. And at this point in my life, cell phones were still very pricey and my parents had deemed one unnecessary.

So there I was next to a cornfield, a bar on the corner where the country road meets the main one. So rather than risking a run in with coyotes, I was ready to sleep in my car until either daylight or my parents came looking. But then a car pulled up.

It was a rusted out, overweight man I had never seen before who was wearing overalls but no shirt. Which struck me as kind of creepy but not out of the ordinary for the area. He asked me if I needed a ride and against my better judgement I agreed and told him I only needed to go to the bar. 

Things really took a turn for the creepy when he started driving. He told me he could take me home because he knew where I lived. I just want to reiterate that I had never even seen

I politely told him the bar would be fine

Finally, so she set me up with a soda while she called my mother. I never saw the man or the rusted out Caprice again.

1374088448.0,1ii7di,Every breath you take...,thenightbattles,253,44,29,"This happened to me during my first year of university

I had injured myself playing sports, but to try and make the time a happy one, I busied myself helping to make costumes for people and doing their makeup. Once I was finally finished, I packed up my makeup and decided to watch some movies in my room. A guy popped up and introduced himself, we chatted a bit and exchanged email addresses and I walked back to my room and said goodnight. The first warning sign was that he walked into my room behind me, despite me saying I was going to walk into my room. I felt really awkward and tried to say, in a roundabout way that he needed to leave. But he wasn't getting the hint. I finally had to say ""you need to leave my room now"". I chalked this up to him maybe being drunk or something, I checked my email and there were 5 from Creep. The first being ""hey I'm so glad we're friends"" and the rest asking why I wasn't online.

A few days later, he was at my door again and the next. I began pretending that I was not home. Another day there was a knock at the door and when I checked the peephole, there was no one there and I assumed the postman had come. I opened the door and lo and behold, it was the creepy guy. He has begun hiding from the peephole so I would be more likely to answer the door. I told my roommate never to open the door if he was there and I told the people living on my floor that this guy was beginning to creep me out, so if he wanted to get on the floor, whatever sob story he gave them, don't let him on.

A few days after that, I was told he waited for FOUR HOURS before leaving. At this point, I was getting freaked out. A few days after that, he began waiting outside the building and if I left, he would follow me wherever I went. I was too spineless to tell him to go away and I tried to be more passive about it. I never spoke, and never gave any indication I was paying attention but he followed me to class, the cafeteria and always tried to follow me home and get access to the floor.

I went to the Resident Advisor (an older student that sort of 'watches over' the floor) and told her what happened. She spoke to the RA for his floor and was told that Creep had been telling his own RA that we were best friends and dating. My RA tried to explain that I was uncomfortable, he would never approach me if I was with a group of people, so my floor-mates banded together. If I went to dinner, I went with my floor and if I wanted a drink, or seconds, someone had to come with me. Walking to class and even waiting for the bus was done in a group. He got onto my floor once when someone else was coming home and he forced his foot in the door to let himself in. I was 'hidden' in another room and when he left my door to go and sit in the television lounge to wait for me- I went downstairs and ran around to the other side of the building and got into my room before he noticed.

Then the phone calls began. I never gave him my number

At this point it was November and I was a wreck. I was tired of having to plan out doing simple things like going for food or walking to a bus stop. Stress wasn't helping me recover from my injury and I was losing weight and I just looked... sickly. I went back to the RA and begged her to help me. She went to the head of the dorms and explained everything that happened. I explained how far this had gone and my roommate told them that he had followed her a few times

I don't know what went on behind closed doors, telling me how awful I was, how could I do this to him? We were so happy together! Surely I was cheating on him with other men. After that, nothing.

1356323073.0,15cwth,Walk-in Closet,,259,50,41,"Just found this subreddit... and holy shit do I have the perfect story.

This happened a few years ago when I graduated college and took my first real job in the city. I had moved back in with my parents after college and the daily commute into the city was really wearing on me. I was finally getting paid enough to live by myself

It was gated and nestled between two residential neighborhoods, I understood why they were charging less for this place. The buildings definitely had some age on them. It looked like they were built in the 60's. I remember being shown the unit and thinking it was kind of drab.

The thing that really stuck out the first time I saw my soon to be bedroom was the large square ""door"" on the side of the room facing the outside. The leasing agent described it as a ""walk-in closet"" which I found to be a little too kind a description. The opening was small because it had to accomodate a sloped ceiling ([example](http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/ny/12-19-sloped-ceiling-1.jpg) to give you an idea of how much horizontal wall space there was.) You definitely had to crouch a lot (or crawl) to get in there, because fuck moving) and moved in.

As I suspected it would, I smelled something faint. I thought it smelled like weed, but I couldn't quite place it. I chalked it up to musk and/or insulation.

As the weeks rolled on my curiosity about the closet piqued a little bit. Every person that I brought over found it to be a really interesting feature of the apartment. One day when I woke up after a late night drinking

When I was out on my patio one day (my apartment faced the woods surrounding the complex) I noticed that the gate that I thought surrounded the entire property stopped when the woods got too dense, as a precaution in case of home invasion. I started to leave it open. I kind of chalked it up as something silly, like running up the stairs after turning the lights out in a basement. Still though, before I went to sleep every night I would think about the little square door a few feet from my bed that had all that space... no amount of logical reasoning would set me at ease. The idea of opening the closet filled me with a sense of dread, that I refused to acknowledge because it seemed so childish.

Eventually enough was enough. I decided the door was going off it's hinges and I was installing a night light. I waited until broad daylight to muster up the courage to open the closet. Even then, almost pushed into the carpet was a red mini Bic Lighter.

I. flipped. the. fuck. out.

There was no way that was there before. I broke my lease the same day and went to stay at a hotel. I tried filing a police report but they said there wasn't enough evidence and the management wouldn't let me out of my lease without paying all the fines. I didn't care. There was no way I was spending another second in that apartment. I even hired movers to come and haul my shit. To this day it still freaks me out a little bit,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_15cwth
1343645703.0,xdwdy,Burning Recliner and Dead Cow,ornery4days,244,35,26,"Hey guys; new here so be gentle. I actually have several stories to share if you're interested

I was about 21 or 22 when this happened. I was in the military at Ft. Sill and didn't know it

We'd already found most of the cattle and were missing another 3 or 4 so we were out at 1am on dirt bikes trying to find them before someone hit one of them and sued his father. My friend and I went east and the other guys went north and south. 

One thing you need to understand about Oklahoma is that most of it farmed; either cattle or crops. It is also divided into one mile sections for the most part. In other words

We didn't know how long the hole had been in the fence. My friends' father only checked the fence because he was missing livestock. They owned the entire mile section and a good portion of the adjoining mile section. The hole in the fence was on the east side of their land

James and I were riding on these old dusty

We had been at it since before 9pm, and we'd already checked the road North of us, then we'd head to the South a mile and then head East again. 

Occasionally

We were on one of the rutted roads, the road was a dead end, but we had to check it and the double back. 

We'd just made the turn back to the east when we saw something burning over the next rise. Grass fires are extremely dangerous and can get out of control in minutes. As we topped the rise

Satisfied that the fire was out, about 100 feet down the road. It was laying in half in and half out of the road. It's throat had been cut and it was laying there with its eyes opened and tongue hanging out. There was blood everywhere. As we were looking at it and trying to figure out what happened, James said ""Hey, look at this!"" and showed me where the blood had dripped from the cow to about ten feet away from it. There were shoe prints of blood in the road. It was just part of a shoe print, but you could tell that was a shoe print. We found two more when we looked more diligently. 

At this point

We talked about going back

We began walking the last quarter mile or so to the dead end. It was at the base of the last hill and we'd just starting heading up it on the other side. My heart was going about 200 miles an hour and I had cotton mouth so bad that it was almost impossible to swallow. Then I noticed that someone had stuck paper plates to the barbs of the wire of the fence. We looked and there were plates stuck to the top strand of wire on both sides of the rode. It started about 50 feet behind us and continued up and over the hill. They were evenly spaced about 5 feet apart. As our gaze followed the row of paper plates up the the top of the hill

I told him that I didn't like this at all. I was OK with losing face in front of our friends and his dad and brothers. I was ready to go. He agreed with me but said that we had to see what was burning. We were both whispering and we were both shaking so much that our voices quavered. 

We started up the hill again and I was thinking with every step that we were going to be seriously killed or worse. As we got to the top of the hill, I started to laugh it off, but James shushed me and told me to listen. We could hear voices. 

As we topped the hill and were able to see the bottom where the road stopped, but the slit throat of the cow haunted my thoughts. They would each take a mouthful and spit it into the fire. This went on until the pitcher was empty. The entire time, they were all saying something in unison. We could only understand an occasional word. They changed their tones in a rhythmic manner with an emphasis on the last word. I can remember hearing ""here and there"" and ""beseech"" and ""Father.""

James and I stood there on top of that hill like a couple of idiots. Our mouths hanging wide open and actually scared stiff. After a minute or two, a man turned and sat the pitcher on the table and picked up what looked like a large loaf of bread. Just as he was turning back to the fire, he evidently saw us. I am sure that we made a nice silhouette sitting there at the top of the hill. He screamed ""hey"" and dropped the loaf of bread and started running in our direction. The others turned and immediately followed him. 

That was all the encouragement that we needed. It was time to go. We turned our bikes around. James got his started on the first kick, but it didn't start. I thought about running, but we were out in the middle of nowhere. I finally started pushing the motorcycle down the other side of the hill and jumped on it. It seemed like it took forever to get enough speed but I popped the clutch and it started. James was waiting at the corner of the intersection to make sure that I was coming and we headed for his house, going way too fast for safety, especially in the dark. 

When we finally got back to his house

That last question stumped us. We hadn't seen any cars or trucks. The road was the only way in or out and there was a creek that ran on the back side of the end of that particular road so they couldn't have gone that direction. How had they gotten there with two recliners? 

When we got to that last stretch of road, James noticed that the cow was gone too. I hate to admit, but I was getting scared all over again. I was afraid that his dad would tell us that it was our imagination and not believe us. 

When we got closer to the burnt spot in the road

We continued toward the hill. The ruts made by spinning motorcycle tires were easily seen but there was no fire on the other side of the hill. We all went down to where the other recliner had been burning

Buster called the county sheriff when we got home and by that time it was daylight and we went out again with the sheriff and a deputy. When we got back to the road

At the bottom of the hill, providing a fairly easy trail to follow. We found a woman's tennis shoe on the other side of the creek. You could see where someone had climbed up the bank on the far side of the creek. We followed the trail all the way across the field up to the next dirt road. Again, the top wire was wrapped around the next lower wire and there was a piece of red bandanna looking material caught in it. There were marks on the road where two or three different cars had spun their tires when they left. Buster also found a large piece of glass that had blood on it. 

Buster filed a report for the missing cow. They'd found four more cows in the opposite direction from where me and James had gone. They never found the recliners or the missing cow. The sheriff called a few days later and told Buster that the blood on the glass was human and not bovine. It was his guess that the pitcher broke and someone cut their hand while carrying it back to their vehicles. Two weeks after that

Sorry it was so long. I got chill bumps while remember all of this. This happened in 1988-89 and I still think about it.  Tell me if you want to read some of the other creepers I have...

A few years back, so you had to walk up this long set of stairs to get to the door.

Anyway

One important part of this story is the doorknob to my and my sister's room was broken. You had to turn it all the way and then employ a little bit of extra force and it would ""pop"" and twist a bit more

So one night

All of the sudden, so we asked who it was. Nobody answered and the doorknob kept jiggling. We called again, this time we were both a little worried. No answer. The doorknob is being shaken like crazy. Someone was really trying to get in.

We were really freaked out, everyone in the house was aware of our doorknob being like this. They would've had no trouble getting in. And if they heard us screaming, they would've said who it was right away.

They had four children, Wayne, and my friend John. John was the surprise child because the others were at least 20 years older than him. John is one of the best people I have ever met in my life, I cannot stress enough just how ALMOST perfect their lives were.

I hate to say that I was ""lucky."" I feel like it makes me a terrible person.

John's older brother Wayne had schizophrenia. When he was on his medication he was fine. When he wasn't he was standing in the yard naked

Needless to say

I moved away, after hanging out we decided that John would come back to my town with me (where more of our friends were) and hang out for the weekend. While he was in my car he asked if I wanted to go by his house and stay with his parents. Now, I'm not going to say that I got some weird feeling telling me not to, or that the cosmos opened and gave me a warning. I simply said ""actually I'm really tired and it's a two hour drive, I think I'd rather just get on the road."" It WAS in fact a weird thing to say, since I've time to think about it. I love John parents! There was absolutely no reason NOT to stop, their house was even on the way out of town. But I felt tired and just didn't want to.

The next morning John came out of my bedroom (I slept on the couch

Two hours later John texts me and tells me something that both scared me and crushed me.

John's brother Wayne had come into his parent's house that morning and had beaten his mother to death with a baseball bat

 She had tried to call John's father and brother.. but they were too late

Sometimes I feel guilty that we didn't at least stop in and say hello

I work events (you know posh do's where you see staff walking around with trays of champagne; well I'm the girl with the tray). Usually it's an easy fun way to make money. My job most of the time is to make sure no-ones glass is empty so naturally in that role you become pretty popular.

Another thing to mention is that I tend to be the only girl on shift when it gets late

So it's a normal night at work for me an awards evening or something like that for all the rich successful suits and ties to bask in their own glory. 

So I'm going round topping up drinks smiling away. Partaking in the usual small talk about the wine or how nice the venue is. But there are these two guys standing alone that wave me over. One guy asked something like 'What's a girl like you working a job like this?' I joking say 'Well someone has to do it' he persists on and asks 'But why?'. I explain like a lot of my co workers I'm a student and living off a student loan in London is near impossible. He tries to push the conversation further but I explain I can't talk as I'm no longer filling his glass and my manager is giving me stink eye... 

So he and friend down their drinks. Not unusual but way this guy and his friend where looking at me just gave me hibbie gibbies. His friend

 So creeped out to fuck I shrug it off and carry on just making a point avoid those two and let one of the lads top up their drinks. Until Guy 1 taps me on the shoulder and asks if I am ignoring them. At this point I give a coworker a look showing how uncomfortable I am around these men. Guy2 looks me in the eye and says 'pour slowly'. I nearly threw up a little at that. Guy1 asks me how I'm getting home I say the night bus

At this point I feel like spitting in their faces but fortunately my manager has been informed I’m being bothered by these men and has come to rescue me. Guy2 says ‘aw don’t take her away I need another drink’ my manager tells him that someone else will fill their glass and that I am needed at the back of house.  I explain all of what they have said he gets as pissed as I was about it and refused to let me get the night bus but to get a lift home in the van. He told me it’s not the first time this has happened and wanted me to be safe I thought he was over reacting but wasn’t going to deny a free lift home. 

Fast-forward to my next shift and one of the lads told me those men had waited outside the venue for me and tried to get my number off them. Seems that rich men really feel like girls who are beneath them (at least economically) can be bought like that. It makes me sick to my stomach to think of what they wanted of me and to that they thought they could buy it.

This guy was bigger than me

He tried to get my attention, “I know I’m not a very attractive male, but I find you very attractive and-” I cut him off, knowing where this was going, and said, “I have a boyfriend.” He got a little more gruff at this and insisted, “Will you take my phone number?” To which I quickly replied, turning back to the window

I felt kind of bad and thought about apologizing for being so blunt about it

Taking my headphone out, and four of them were ""I have a boyfriend"". Pretty valid reason. Besides, I don't owe him a reason for not being interested. Then he got in a rage about how, apparently, sunlight was reflecting off my phone and into his eyes and I was sending him mixed signals.

At this point I got out and readied my pepper spray, and he was much bigger. He got up, apparently too pissed off to even sit near me, and stormed to the front of the bus. As he passed me he looked me right in the eye and said, “be glad I don’t have a gun”, put two fingers to his head, and pulled the trigger. His ranting just got louder and worse when he sat down towards the front of the bus. It would vary between angry growling that I could barely hear
He called me a cunt, a lot of which sounded crazy and incoherently threatening.

I was scared. 
I was terrified. 

Not a single person on the bus seemed to notice this man harassing me, clutching my pepper spray, scared to ignore him completely in case he got up again and came after me. It was at this point that the driver, a young woman, pulled the bus over and told him he needed to leave. He argued with and yelled at her, eventually saying he would just shut up, that he needed to be on this bus. She shrugged and picked up the radio

When I got to my stop at the end of the route I waited to be the last person and thanked the driver, that if he hadn't gotten off when he did she was about to fuck him up. 

I thanked her again and got to work, or on the bus, and this time he would have a gun. Like I said, I have to take that bus upwards of seven times a week.

My sister got off the bus, she noticed a man pull up in a car beside a younger girl that was 8 and started talking to her.

1373860061.0,1ibfzx,My Biggest Bully,Theliterside,237,29,93,"I’m not certain that this story belongs on this sub but as it involves a story that does involve a level of stalking I figure I would post it here.  To gain a proper context of this story I should explain some things about the town I grew up in.

I lived (in still live) in one of the wealthier counties in the United States.  You have towns that fall in the low-middle class bracket with the majority being middle-middle to upper-middle class.  I lived in one of those towns.  At the time of this story (95-96’) the majority of this town was Caucasian with a few Hispanic and Asian families.  Seeing as I am a minority I was used to being teased and/or bullied due to the color of my skin.  As it was a suburban neighborhood it never went beyond racial slurs/light bullying though.  On to the story.

The town has five schools (not including the Catholic school).  There are two that cater to the Pre-K to fifth grade crowd while two others that go from Pre-K to eighth grade (one of each type on the north and south side of town) with a high school that takes in children from the north and south sides respectively.  I was attending the Pre-K to 5th on the north side at the time.  I had never heard much about a particular teacher until it was getting close to when I was entering the fifth grade but apparently everyone wanted to be in his class.  His name was John.  He had been teaching at the school for a number of years, not by preference).  

For the first month or so I could see why everyone loved him.  He taught in a way that was quirky but practical.  He liked the children to engage in their studies rather than feel the need to cram it in before dismissing it.  He had a passion for every lesson he taught (keep in mind that for primary school the teacher would cover all topics from mathematics to history to English).  He loved to joke around and get his students laughing whenever possible.  That’s what lead to the beginning of when things began to go sour.  

One day he had told a particularly funny anecdote.  Everyone in the class began laughing.  One by one the kids began to quiet down until one student, grabbed the back of his head, slammed it twice against his desk before pulling it back up.  A.J. sort of toppled over and fell to the ground.  Everyone in the classroom was silent.  John then began to semi-kick/sweep A.J. out of the classroom (his desk was the second one from the door) until he was in the hallway.  And then, as though nothing had happened, he continued going on with his lesson.

The next day A.J. was absent, and a man and  a woman in suits (I later concluded that it was CPS).  They wanted to know what had happened yesterday in class.  I told them what I had seen and I was sent back up to class.  Two days later A.J. was still absent but John was back to teaching.

I need to really stress that John and his family were very connected and well liked throughout the town.  I say this because though this happened almost twenty years ago I cannot understand how:
1.	He was allowed to keep his job.
2.	He knew that I had told the truth.

From then on out the abuse began lightly.  The first thing John would do is begin volunteering me to answer any and all questions he had while teaching.  It made no difference if other children raised their hands when he asked a question; he would always call on me.  I was always shy and never liked to stand out in a crowd and the more he did this the more I became nervous as
 
After a few weeks I began receiving detention for others misbehaving.  If kids were caught talking or passing notes it was my fault even if I was sitting across the room.  The first thing he did since “I was obviously such a trouble maker” was pick up my desk (it was a desk with the chair attached to it) along with me in it and move me to the back of the room near the closets.  As I was adopted (it was well known in my town as I had made a speech in fourth grade about how I was adopted but proud to be an American) the next step was having me face the wall as “Only true Americans should be allowed to learn.”  

One particular incident that I will never forget is when a classmate had made a paper plane and thrown it across the room.  When John saw that I had detention for the afternoon (I had detention almost every afternoon for the rest of the year).  When everyone else had left his assignment for me was to write a five-hundred word essay on the history of aviation.  Keep in mind I had no books

“Where do you think you’re going?” He asked
“I’m leaving.  I can’t do this and my mom is waiting for me outside.” (I lived six blocks from home but I was hoping he would think that I had a concerned parent outside he would let me leave)

When I saw that he didn’t believe that I dashed for the door without my books or backpack and bolted down the stairs until I hit the first floor.  I breathed a sigh of relief but it was cut short as I heard the second floor stairway door slam open and his footsteps rushing down the stairs.  I bolted out of the back doors and did not stop running until I was down the block from my house.  

At the time both of my parents were working.  My mom would normally get home at 3-4 whereas my dad was working until 6-9 at night.  My mom initially thought that I was saying these things about my teacher because I wanted attention but when it started to become common for me to come home and crawl into a fetal position as I cried for a couple of hours she began doing some investigating.  Before I knew it my mom was at the school after hours almost every day fighting for justice or to have me placed in another classroom.  Much later in my life I heard that my mom had a meeting with the principal and John.  She explained what I had told her had been happening.  John’s response to her was “I don’t really see what I’m doing wrong here.” with a smug grin on his face.  

The principal believed me and my mom and was willing to fight for me.  This is why I say that I wanted to stress that him and his family had leverage in town.  The day the principal promised us that he would begin investigating into the matter the board of education made him an offer.  In exchange for dropping any investigation they would promote him to superintendant.  Immediately he was gone and we had a substitute principal (who I also had later as a substitute teacher in the seventh grade).  I would think that he was told that he was there until a replacement principal could be found.  No investigations were ever launched and any further complaints to the temporary principal were met with “My hands are tied and there’s nothing we can do.”  

This story can continue for a while but I’ll focus on what happened as a form of retaliation for getting my mother involved.  One day right before recess John told my classmates (while I was in the room) that I was not a true American and people like me needed to learn my place.  He “suggested” that they do what they felt they should do to make me feel “welcome” on the playground and to spread the word to the kids in the other class.  The first day I went outside to play for lunch I had two kids double team me.  If I even tried to take a swing another kid who was standing around would push me so that I would lose my balance.  Since John had taken the volunteer role of watching over the kids during recess and lunch time no one came to my aid.  For the rest of the school year I was eating my lunch and spending my recess/lunch periods inside in the stairway with my niece and a few of the special education kids to keep me company.  

By the end of the school year I had gotten used to sitting outside of the classroom for portions of the class (my trouble-making was bad enough where sitting in the back turned away from everyone else wasn’t effective anymore)

I have relayed this story and I know that it sounds far-fetched or completely made up.  After all, the principal had been bribed to keep his mouth shut and move on.  I told him that I held nothing against him and still speak to him on a rare occasion.  

I can say that John was a defining person in my life.  He changed how I saw the world, drinks, (once a rock) at me because it was what they had been told to do by a teacher seven years earlier.  All I could do was make sure that my nieces and nephew never had to deal with him and try to move on as best as I could.  The last I heard he still coaches baseball and softball and still teaches.  He still lives in the same house he lived in when I had him as a teacher.  Though I have seen him around town I have never once spoken to him since fifth grade and the one time where we were close enough to each other that he could recognize me I do not believe he knew who I was.  That’s my story of the worst bully I’ve ever had.  Not from the hands of a student but from a teacher.  I apologize if it does not belong in this sub.  If it should be posted somewhere else please be kind and point me towards where it should be posted.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.  I will try to answer what I can.  If I am unclear about anything in particular I am very sorry.  I am writing this while I am very tired and I am recalling an event that took place almost twenty years ago. 

Edit:  Thank you to all of those who have expressed kind words or warm wishes.  When I posted this I did not expect this story to get the amount of attention that it did and it means a lot that so many of you agree that what took place was wrong.  I especially did not expect for people to become so angry at John that they have been requested his information.  If you read my responses below you will see why I am hesitant in releasing said information.  

To those who feel as though I should take vigilante action against him please understand that what you are advising or suggesting is illegal.  As I have no intention or desire to go to jail or commit a greater act of violence I will not entertain any suggestion of doing so.  So please guys

I went to Europe last summer with my three best friends.  We were all 19 at the time.  A week and a half into the trip we were in Barcelona, we found a large grassy knoll with a walking path and young people sitting around.  It was located right on the harbour, and was bordered by a busy street.  We decided to sit down on the grass off the path and just enjoy the night sky and this beautiful city.

It wasn't long before a man, completely ignoring the path and just taking the shortest route right to us.  At the very last second before walking pretty much through us, he swerves tightly around us, continues his walk trying to look casual, and returns to a bench situated at the bottom of the hill.  We were confused, but just figured maybe he thought he knew us and wanted to check it out before realizing his mistake.

A few minutes later, on his cell phone.  When he gets close enough, he puts the cell phone down, receiver towards us, and - as we all noted - never hung up.  He then starts talking to us, asking us questions about whether we were going to party that night, where we were going, but firm in saying we weren't going out that night.  He started asking where we were staying

After we'd spent what felt like five minutes shutting most of his questions down

To top it all off, and the second was there to find out where we were staying for whoever was on the other end of the line.  So, logically, we booked it out of there, doing our best not to be seen by them.

In the room, the door was slightly cracked so that a small sliver of light was peering in. It caught my eye, and I noticed a crouched silhouette outside the door.  

I sat up, caught flat-footed and unable to escape.  This was a friend of our group, Will, who was a bit older, in his early 20's at the time.  I could see fear and shame behind his glasses.  He was skeletally thin, and had a sort of nerdy appearance.  

""What the fuck..."" I said, and that I was going to have a talk with him.

I took him into an empty laundry room, that we weren't gonna have sex, et cetera.

I looked under the bed, and there were those glasses shining back at me. ""Jesus, Will..."" I said.  Kelly sat up immediately.

That night, and were left with me shirtless in the street, clutching my purple ribcage. Police officers immediately pointed out the fact that I was intoxicated. How would I know who the hell hit me in my condition?

The end result? TJ never got any criminal charges. 

Luckily, at our request. 

For a while, carefree girl I had known Freshman year once again. Though she still refused to sleep or walk alone, She no longer nervously checked her email or Facebook every ten minutes, and she even began to go out to the bars some nights. Eventually, even I stopped carrying around the small knife in my boot when I went out at night.

Eventually, of course, so he would leave a ranting voicemail. The topic of these messages usually varied. Sometimes it would be a ranting political anecdote. Sometimes he'd talk about biology, or a recent Jim Carry movie that came out. 

Other times he'd scream at the top of his lungs for her to pick up the goddamn phone.

Over time, then one a month. As time moved by, Alyssa's attitude towards the situation changed. It became apparent that TJ was no longer something she could eradicate, moreso something she would have to live to live with. 

Junior and Senior year went bye relatively normally. He would still call her here and there

There was also a historic village in the park

One of the first things I was told on the job was to not be surprised if we saw people doing the deed out in the woods. Apparently the park was a popular hookup spot for people.  If we saw them, stopped and moved along.  Mainly we didn't want little kids to be exposed to that.  The park rangers patrolled at night too, and said they would catch people in the park then too, mainly teenagers, cheaters and gay men (my boss actually showed us all website of how our park had made some sort of top ten list for local hookup spots on some sort of forum for cheaters and another one for gay men, the park was apparently just a good hookup spot). The park rangers would usually just write down plate numbers and tell people not to come back, and then write a ticket if they did.

So one night we have to stay late, we see this naked guy just furiously rubbing his balls on the outside of one of the brick buildings.  I mean this guy is just slamming his balls on the wall (yes, balls to the wall) and rubbing them up and down.  I didn't bother paying attention, but the coworker I was with said the guys sack was starting to bleed.

So we start yelling at him to get out of there, and gets the other maintenance truck to do the same, looking for cars in the lots.  We check them all and there's no cars that don't belong to staff.  Whatever, freaks gonna freak, we figured maybe this guy had been meeting someone there and got carried away or was on drugs or something.

Anyway, this guy just rubbing his balls all over this historic building and all and then disappearing.  BTW, he had no clothes with him, so he must have stashed them somewhere.  Anyways, the park ranger tells us that he had caught some teenagers a few weeks before making out in the park who had told them about what sounded like the same guy.  He thought they were bullshitting to try to get out of trouble or something, now thinks maybe they weren't.  Same building, and right around sunset (which is strange

After that the rangers kept an eye out for the guy, literally, gets off by rubbing their sack violently against historic buildings?",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1h126g/how_would_that_even_feel_good/
1351838621.0,12i5mi,"""I made you. You belong to me.""",AMQR,259,52,36,"Four years ago I met a woman named Courtney. Over the course of a year she stalked

 I had moved from Kansas to Pennsylvania after my husband got a job working in the Oilfield. I severed ties with all the friends I had back in Kansas and decided I was going to start fresh. We settled into our gorgeous new home and got back to our normal routine. I am a young stay at home wife. I am unable to bear children and me and my husband decided we didn't want to do any medical treatments and we'd accepted a child free life. Soon I realized that I was painfully lonely. I hadn't made any friends and my husband was often gone, had the same sense of humor, was young and even was unable to have children. I immediately clicked with this girl and eventually we met for coffee. 

She was spunky, was fairly shy, reserved and mostly awkward. I obsessed about my weight and really didn't have much confidence. Courtney changed that. She'd take me shopping and show me what looked good on me. She pressured me to talk to people, coached me on how to make friends. She was like an Angel to me.

 After a few months of very close friendship I was practically a new person. I loved myself. But I started to realized I was becoming a lot like her. I've always been an individual

I had more friends and probably the best social life I had ever had. Due to having more friends I had stopped spending nearly as much time as I had with Courtney. I could hear the devastation in her voice when I would tell her I had other plans that night. I felt incredibly bad when I had to turn her down but I still maintained a good relationship with her. I still considered her my *best friend*. 

But that was all about to rapidly change.

It was a Saturday, someone who'd become another extremely good friend, close to being consider my best friend. Stephanie told me that apparently one of the girls that was going to be out dinner had some sort of drama with Courtney and that Stephanie had only made reservations for four, not five people. I called Courtney and told her the bad news. She sounded upset but brushed it off and said it was no big deal and that she'd find something to do. I finish getting ready and headed out to dinner. While at dinner Stephanie started receiving messages from a blocked number saying ""Cunt"" ""Whore"" ""Bitch"" amongst other texts. I had a sinking feeling it was Courtney but honestly didn't want to believe it. This was the beginning on the long crazy train Courtney took me on.

Stephanie continued getting nasty texts and it brought us closer. I had confided in her that I thought it may be Courtney and that I would talk to Courtney about it. I confronted Courtney who vehemently denied it. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and brushed it off. After confronting her Courtney had began to be very stand offish to me. I figured she was pissed because I had blamed her. Soon everyone I would hang out with started getting texts from a blocked number saying the same things. Then I started seeing Courtney every time I went out with my girlfriends. At first she'd come up to me and exclaim just how crazy it was we ended up at the same bar/club/restaurant. Eventually she just stopped saying anything. She'd just stare. She'd sit somewhere near by and stare. At this point I had talked to her less and less because her craziness was just escalating and I honestly couldn't stand being around her.

Eventually after seeing her for the billionth time at the same place I confronted her. I was angry. It was obvious she was following me just to give off bad vibes. And she was the one behind the texts.

I strolled up to her and said ""What the fuck is your problem?""

""Nothing.""

At this point I felt a little bad for being so harsh so I calmed down

What she said next chilled me to the bone.

**""I made you. You belong to me.**

I didn't even know how to respond. How the hell could this crazy woman think she *owned* me?! I told her that it needed to stop and I didn't want a thing to do with her any longer. I stormed off and went about my night.

Two months go by and I hear nothing from Courtney. I figured it was over, I really hope you wake up soon. It's bad"" 

and finally one last text from a number I didn't recognize

""Check your Facebook. I hope you like my handy work ;) -C ""

I yanked open my laptop and logged onto Facebook. Plastered all over my wall were pictures of me. Nude pictures. I quickly took a screen shot of what I could and then deactivated my Facebook. I went through the nudes, they informed there was nothing I could do. I couldn't prove it was her.

Over the course of the next few months

Then the crazy hit the fan.

She kidnapped my fucking dog.

Quick history: About 3 months before this, the law caught up with me. I had driven home without my headlights on one night and was cited and etc.

Pan back to 3 AM, waving her arm at me and yelling out. I finally notice that it has seemed a bit dark on the road... My lights had been off. I flip them on and curse at myself for being such a fool. Though in reality, this was only the beginning of my foolishness that night.

I think to myself, and I see that she is walking in the direction I am headed. Why not return the favor? She saved me around a hundred dollars, I can save her time off her journey! 

Now, she seemed near my age, and the bags were Kroger brand. Any other time I would have still just gone home, but my mind was set on helping this person who just helped me. Even if she was homeless, which I doubted from my assessment, I had experience with such hitchhikers. I kept a serrated blade in my car in case anyone I helped became unruly (which has happened twice before, always ending with a hinted flash of steel and the asshole quickly retreating from my car). My hazy mind had made itself up as I pulled a U-turn and headed back over the overpass.

The woman stopped walking and looked at me as I pulled up. She was extremely cautious as I stopped

""Thank you

She walked up to the car with bags in hand. As she got closer

""You sure? I live right round this corner, but instead I tell her it's no problem after how she helped me, and she tosses her bags in the back before getting in. Her voice has a bit of southern influence, and her hair is a little dirty, but only as if she hadn't showered in a few days, no worse. She begins to tell me how she lives in an apartment that I knew of not far from where I stopped. She then tells me that she wanted to make a stop though, as one of her friends had gotten something for her and she was afraid her friend's boyfriend would steal it if she didn't get it tonight. More signs of 'this shit is fucked up', so we stop at a nearby gas station.

""Shoot, so I hand her some cash and we get back out onto the road. Most of our talking is limited to directions, but she asks if I go to the college or work. Small talk, nothing personal or deep. That's when I start to notice where she's leading me... The BAD part of the neighborhood. Trash is littered everywhere, shady characters are shuffling around, and it's only getting worse the more I drive. We reach her destination, where two very intimidating black men are standing outside a liquor store. She gets out and asks me to turn around in an alleyway

'Shit... I fucked up.' My exhausted mind had finally realized this wasn't a smart idea, and I reach beside my seat to find my knife, gripping it tightly as though it was some sort of reassurance that I was gonna be fine. If I had been attacked, that knife was not saving me. The biggest of the two comes up to my window and peers around my car. I keep my coolest composure possible. He tilts his head up and I do the same. He asks if I'm there with the woman, and I nod once before he simply backs away. At that moment, the woman runs out and hops back into the car. She's smiling and says everything is good. I could not be happier to get the hell outta there.

She ruffles through her purse and asks excitedly if she can smoke in my car. I ask if she means cigarettes, and without asking if it was, I tell her sure. This is where, exhausted or not, my mind finally notices that 'I done fucked up'. The woman pulls a small bag from her purse and a clear pipe. The contents of the bag are not green. In fact, they look completely unfamiliar to me until she pulls something out.

Crack

Fuck. I picked up a fucking crack head. I am so fucking dead. She is going to kill me

""Hey baby, let alone get me out of it. I've done crazy shit before, but this was too much. 

'If I deny her

I look at her for a minute, even though I was literally freaking out on the inside. ""No thanks, drinking and smoking cigs are enough vices for me.""

...

She laughed. It takes me by surprise as she shrugs her shoulders. ""We all got vices, baby."" I exhale a huge breath of relief. 'This may turn out okay', I think to myself. As we drive, keeping a hand on my knife and the woman firmly focused on her drugs, the road is empty. We get out of the BAD area without problems, and I feel like I'm home free.

""Oooooo..."" 

A moan comes from my passenger, blowing another hit, and moaning as she exhales. ""Shit..."" She smirks, eyes closed and feet stretched out as far as possible. ""He gave me them wicked rocks.""

""What?"" I ask

""Oh right, moving in an obvious way.

""Oh yeah?"" I reply. Really I'm thinking

""Hey

No.

""...maybe an ounce...""

No!

""...go back to your place...""

NO!

""...have a little fun

OH FUCK NO!

""Uhh, ya know."" Maybe she would be disinterested if I don't have money. But instead, she just frowns, her hand still at it.

""Oh

""It's okay, I just got off work, I'm ready to crash."" I may have been a hormonal 19 year old, but I was not THAT hormonal! Luckily, I saw her complex come into view, and so did she. She pouted and stopped her little playtime as I pulled up and stopped at the entrance. She packed her items away in her purse and got out. Grabbing her bags from the back, she looked back through the passenger window.

""You sure though? I could just come back to your place and... rape you a bit..."" 

I sped off without a second thought, and making a mad dash for the complex. I slammed and locked the door, turning with my back to it, letting out a breath I had been holding since first escaping what may have been the most ignorant and creepiest night of my life.

I was living paycheck to paycheck so the apartment wasn't in the classiest area of town.  Since it was the seedy area of town there were quite a few homeless people in the area.  There was one particular guy who was always hanging around the apartment building.

My apartment was an addition to an older building

I got off from work at midnight.  I got home one night and was about to unlock my door when I heard a shout of ""Hey, and I declined.  I was glad that I hadn't unlocked and opened my door yet, because he asked if he could use my bathroom and looked like he'd have pushed his way in if possible.  I told him no, and said that I had forgotten to stop at the store on my way home so I had to leave.  I went to a 24 hour diner, had a couple of cups of coffee and went home.  When I got home I didn't see the guy anywhere, so I rushed inside and locked my door.  The next day, when I went to get the mail I walked through the hedge.  I happened to glance down and there were several empty bottles of shampoo that were the size you get at a hotel.  There were also many, but didn't give it too much thought.

The next night I was lying in bed

I woke up at about 3 in the morning.  I went out into the kitchen to get a drink and noticed that my cat was out of food.  I turned on the light so that I could find the food in the cabinet.  I finished filling the cat's bowl and was walking across the kitchen to put the food away when the lights went out.  

I walked out of my door to see if it was a neighborhood wide power outage (not the best plan, so there was no way for me to really tell.  I was too tired to deal with it, so I went back inside and went to bed.

Anyway, the laundry room and the living room. Typically I keep all my lights turned off except for the room I am currently in. 

This happened yesterday. My brother had phoned me in the morning telling me L.A. Noire was on sale on Steam but it was a daily summer deal. I hadn't been at my desktop all day so all day I had been putting off buying but it was a game I had really wanted.

So when it was just about time for the sale to end when I realized that I hadn't bought it yet. My apartment complex is really old and has wood floors. There's a spacing between each floor so when I walk it kind of echoes through the house. 

I was in the living area on the couch on my laptop like usual when I thought I heard the door open. I just figured it was one of my six cats and continued on my laptop. So I didn't think anything of it then I looked at the time and remembered I had forgotten to buy the game. I bolted from the couch and ran through the laundry room (sounding like a herd of elephants I'm sure due to the age of the apartment complex), as I began walking out of my room to the door leading to the parlour I heard someone like scratching against the floor. I walked quickly into the parlour and turned on the light to see a very large man (very tall, very bulky muscles) scrambling from the floor and out my door. A neighbour who had heard the crash was out in the hallway and we called the police. We're awaiting response to see if they caught him or not. 

It was scary. Definitely makes me want to lock the door all the time. Normally I don't because I know all my neighbours and I'm at the end of the hall so I never considered someone coming through the complex and robbing the farthest apartment from the lift/staircase.

I've always been a bit of a night owl and the summer after we moved into this house I was already back into the swing of falling asleep at 4 or 5am and walking up at 1 or 2pm. Since it was summer

One night in particular, woke up my stepdad and told him about the dude outside. My stepdad walks out the back door, me behind him, and there was nobody out there. He looks at me pissed and tells me to go to sleep because it was late and to not wake him up unless there's actually something going on.

Fast forward a few nights later and I see the same guy pacing up and down my driveway. This time I just sit there and watch and after 5 minutes he leaves. 

Another few nights later I se him again only this time he's just standing in front of the basketball goal

He does this for a good couple of minutes then leaves. 

The next night he's back and does it again. By this time I'm starting to get wigged out by this and I tell my stepdad and mom the following evening about what's been going on. They think I'm completely full of shit.

That night, mustering up all my teenage courage, I yell out to him, ""Hey! You better leave or I'm calling the police!"" He abruptly stops. Looks at my window and runs. I think to myself, hey alright I got him to leave. He shouldn't be coming back. 

I was wrong.

The next night, yell I am going to call the police again but this time he just stares. I am thoroughly freaked out so I slam my windows shut, close the blinds, and run to my parents room. Wake up my stepdad. Tell him what happened. He tells me to get my ass in bed and not bother him again.

I did not sleep a wink that morning. 

The following night, there he was. He leans over to get on eye level with me, smiles, waves, then walks away. At this point I decide it's time to call the cops. I call them. They come. They find nobody. My parents are PISSED. I get grounded. I PLEAD with them telling them that there was a guy outside my window. They were having none of it.

A few days later I had been cleaning so my windows were open. I forgot to shut them but I had the blinds down. I hear a scraping noise on one of the screens. I run to the window, slam the window shut, run to my parents room freaking out begging them to do something. They look at my window and conclude that I cut the screen myself and they extend my grounding sentence. It's really at this point when my mother says she wishes she had listened to me back then.

I stopped keeping my windows open. I started sleeping in one of the living rooms. I was terrified. After about a week of sleeping in the living room we started getting phone calls. It started as someone calling the house then hanging up immediately. Then he started talking. If I answered the phone, kid."" or ""I hope you know these cute little bars won't keep you safe.""

1349702239.0,114wk1,The Man in the Ice Cream Stand,Hghwytohell,231,29,37,"I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, drugs, someone would come over and cause some trouble. This is a story of one of those times. 

I was 10 at the time, local place that was usually pretty busy, but since my karate lessons didn't end until 9pm, the time the shop closed, we were usually the only ones there at that point. It was owned and run by an Irish man named Mr. Murphy, who knew us by name and was always very outgoing and friendly. I should also mention that the gym and this ice cream stand were located in a large strip mall with quite a large parking lot, which was notoriously frustrating to get out of as it had 2 one way entrances but only 1 exit.

One day, and my karate instructor stayed with me until my father arrived. The rest of the parking lot was fairly empty, as most of the stores were closed. When my father finally came, we walked over to the ice cream stand, thinking that it was probably closed, but to our surprise the metal screen was only halfway closed, and there was a light on inside. We figured Mr. Murphy was still there, he might be willing to serve us late. My dad knocked on the counter and asked if anyone was there. No one answered, the metal screen opened up.

Inside the stand was not the friendly ice cream man I had known, heavily bearded man wearing a windbreaker that was at least 3 sizes too small. I couldn't see what he had on below his waist, but he wasn't wearing a shirt and he smelled like my dog after rolling around in the mud all day. He had a very creepy grin on his face, showing a crooked row of yellow, nicotine stained teeth. His hair looked like it was falling out. His eyes were squinting, as if he couldn't see us clearly. He stared at us for awhile, then cocked his head and started to speak. 

""You buy ice cream?""

That voice. I can still remember that voice perfectly. I'm not going to say it sounded inhuman, because that's simply not the best way to describe it. It was disturbed. It was delirious. It was a bit insane. And his smile after he said it. He tilted his head down a bit, so I could see the top of his balding hair, as his grin grew wide from cheek to cheek. My dad instantly grabbed me and turned me away. He shouted at the man.

""Who are you? Where is the owner?""

""You buy ice cream?""

""How did you get into the stand?""

""You buy ice cream?""

""I'm calling the police.""

It was at this point that the man placed something on the counter. He held it in his fist, probably one used to cut fishing wire and such. Small, but sharp. My dad had enough at this point. He picked me up and threw me in the car. He came inside and locked the doors as he took out his cell phone to call the police. Meanwhile, though I was as scared as I had ever been in my life, I turned back to look at the stand. The man was not in the window anymore, but *outside of the stand, walking slowly towards our car.* Not only that, and couldn't speak

I mentioned how there is only 1 exit to the parking lot. One of the reasons it's so annoying is that it exits onto a busy street with a light, my dad looked behind us and told me he didn't see the man anymore. I was starting to feel a little better until we felt something thud against our trunk. We turned around and there he was,screaming something indecipherable, banging on our trunk. His grin had turned into an angry snarl, and his eyes were open wider. I screamed as my dad decided to floor it into the oncoming traffic. Luckily we didn't cause an accident, but my dad raced home at about twice the speed limit. 

Over the next few days it was all pieced together. This man had apparently broken into the ice cream stand after the owner had left and was sleeping in there. The door was locked, even birth. There was a current warrant out on him for aggravated assault and attempted rape. My dad went and gave an official statement of the incident to the police, but after that everything just pretty much went back to normal, as they usually do in these stories. I don't know if they ever actually caught the guy, and as far as I know no one else in our town ran into him. The man became almost a figment of my imagination, and if it weren't for my father re-telling the story to everyone he knew, I may have even forgot about it entirely. 

The only mystery left in the story was the ice cream stand. It never re-opened after that night, since I find it awkward to talk about the incident with him, seeing as he sees it as a heroic escape story and I see it as a memory to forget. Still, I find it odd that such a successful, ambitious man like Mr. Murphy would close down his shop for good overnight. I guess that's the disappointing part about stories like these; there's always that one unsolved detail that will bring you back to the memory you want to forget.

Thanks for reading, some that happened to me and others that happened to people I know. If you enjoyed this one, i'll definitely post more.

EDIT: Spelling and Grammar

UPDATE: So I talked to my Dad today and remembered to bring it up. He was surprised that I didn't know or that he never told me, he decided to close down the stand rather than fix to have it repaired. I never saw him again only because I had never seen him outside of the stand. My dad said he moved out of town a while ago, he doesn't know where. So I guess that solves that mystery. I feel sorry for the guy, he was nice. I guess it isn't as exciting an ending as it could've been, but i'm just happy that nothing bad ended up happening to him. ",,False,t5_2t3t8,True

After I hung up the phone, jeans and sneakers. No logos, no uniform. I didn't get a good read on his face. He kept knocking! At this point it was riling up my dog, and he was barking on top of the knocking. I swear, the knocking seemed to go on forever.

I checked the locks on the doors to make sure they were secure.

Then suddenly it stopped. Quiet.

Creak. The sound of the side gate to my house.

My pulse raced. Maybe it's the meter reader? I stood in panic in the living room.

The next thing I heard was shuffling coming from the bathroom. Could it be my cat playing with the shower curtain? I had to check. I walked down the hall and peered around the corner to see inside my bathroom. I'll never forget what I saw.

The window in the shower was pried open. In the middle of my bright and sterile bathroom was a dark mass pouring in through the window. One leg at a time.

Oh

So I bolted up the stairs as carefully and silently as I could. I heard my dog barking incessantly. Not in a panic

I closed my bedroom door behind me as quietly as possible. I didn't shut it all the way as to not make any noise. Cellphone. I picked it up and wondered who would come quicker... 911 or my mom who was at work less than a mile away. I dialed her number.

In a whisper: ""Mom... mom... there's someone in the house... mom

The creak of his footsteps on the stairs. Fuck! Think fast! I ducked underneath my desk. I could hear one step at a time as he slowly ascended the stairs. It was like a movie. I quickly dialed 911...

That's when my bedroom door slowly opened. His head peered around it to scan the room. That was it

“Please don’t hurt me! Please don’t hurt me!”

“Don’t scream! Don’t say anything!”

With a gloved hand

I heard my house getting trashed downstairs. I could hear my dog jumping and barking at the invader(s?) and I could hear them hushing him in a baby voice.

“Shhh

Quiet again. For what felt like hours.

I heard my name. I was stunned and confused. I heard it again. My mom. I ran down the stairs. The front door was wide open. There she was in my living room. I burst into tears and told her everything. I was still in a panic. Was he still in the house? Was he hiding?

We called 911. They came and investigated. A pillow case (to stuff the items in), laptop, and leather jacket (for disguise) were the items missing. I spoke with a forensic artist. The cops drove me around the neighborhood to take a look at suspects they stopped on the street. He was never caught.

After everything was settled

My post traumatic stress terrorized my life. I had to sleep in my mom’s room. I kept a knife under my pillow. Everywhere I went, I still feel the effects of PTSD today.

The scary thing here is that he was a landscaper. My family never had enough money for landscaping but both our neighbors did. Landscapers are given access to people’s yards (sometimes when they’re not home) and have plenty of time to scope out unlocked windows, call 911 first!

My mother comes from a rich family. Her father won the lottery and bought a jet company. This attracted the attention of a man named Brian.

Brian came from a small town in Nebraska. His whole family were chiropractors, with brothers. He was a kickboxer, and won many contests. He was a GOOD kickboxer.

He went to school to be a chiropractor, unmarried. In Brian's eyes, they were disgusting mistakes. My mother lost custody of them after their father walked in on Brian beating them or screaming at them. Her whole family turned against her, thinking she let Brian hurt them.

They were married shortly after. There is no evidence. No certificate
He came to my mother at her condo and told her that God told him that they could have sex now, things got creepy.

On my third birthday, and took my mother and I to live in an creepy man's 1 bedroom house. The man's name was Jack, he was a patient of Brian's. 
As I grew up, except for other neighbor children. I slept on the floor in the bedroom, and my mother slept in the bed; my father slept on a few blankets beside me, watching me. In addition, I was forced to be home schooled. 

Moving on a few years; We moved to a slightly larger house because ""God told him his enemies were close."" Jack came along. The house was under his name

Brian had many...odd things he did. He'd sleep through most of the day, in the living room, or kick me out of my bedroom and sleep there. If you would wake him up during one of his naps he would scream, ""I was so under the holy spirit! It was like I was beneath a pool, it was beautiful and you took me from it! God was talking to me! GOD HAS TOLD ME TO PUNISH YOU!"" and would ravenously slap and kick me. If he was in a better mood, he would be ""Deaf in the spirit,"" and only able to communicate through a weird ""sign language"" and glare at you, in the car

At least once a month he would walk into Jack's room, he would begin to slap and scream at Jack louder and harder. 

My mother has been broken the entire time I've known her. Once they were married, not one friend. She turned to alcoholism. She was a shell of a person, it was impossible to go to her for help. All she could do was lash out and wait for her turn to be beaten.

Eventually, and then approach me and lock me into our laundry room or a closet for ""Being disgusting.""

I lost those friends quickly. I turned to having pets. Brian allowed me to raise rabbits, so they were worth a lot.

One day I decided I wanted to keep one of the kits as my own pet. I named it Turkey, and my mother agreed I should keep it. This made him very angry.

Here's where the stuff gets dark.

Brian was mowing the lawn before I was supposed to take the 4 baby bunnies outside to play. I took them outside afterwards to the bunny patch I created and fenced off (Using sticks, and one of them starts to utter this screaming noise, and I begin to panic. Its nose starts to bleed, and it starts to spasm. I start crying and screaming for help, but my mother wasn't home (She would walk to the park and drink at the picnic area) and Brian had mysteriously left. 
The bunny begins to become paralyzed, and he dies, his face frozen in a scream. 

I knew what death was

Until another baby began to scream. I've never shouted louder than I did at that moment, even Turkey.

Just as Brian walked into the door, screaming in terror. He immediately called me a monster and told me to ""Get off his property before I kill you you fucking murderer!"" I took off outside to the bunny patch and sat there sobbing and wondering why they died and why God would do that to me. I turned, and saw a few feet away from the bunny patch... Insecticides. Poison for ants and roaches, that kind of stuff. I picked up some grass from the bunny patch and realized it had been sprayed, and that was what had poisoned them. I immediately began blaming myself for not knowing. Brian came out later and threw the dead babies at me in a plastic Publix bag, and told me to bury them.

A few months pass. I discover the internet, and one baby, quarter-sized turtle in a giant tank outside. I love them all so much. I spend most of my time in the AOL Children's chatrooms. One day, I'm invited to a sleepover by a neighbor girl. Brian says I can go, and I ask him to feed Meepy (baby turtle) and the rest of my turtles. I spend 2 full days at her house having so much fun, and come home to the turtle tank to check on my Meepy.

I don't find Meepy. What I do find is a tiny, and comes outside and says, and I quote, ""This is why you can't have pets! You can't take care of anything! Are you going to kill your children too and forget to feed them? They ate him because you starved them!""

A few more months pass. Abuse is plentiful

One day, and keep him in the garage outside. I feed him cheerios and nuts and he never tries to run away. Every time I go into the garage he runs up my leg, and onto my shoulder to give squirrel-kissies. He was the sweetest thing. He grew to be about a teenager squirrel; 
Until one day Brian saw I had gotten kicked off the AOL chatroom. I'm in the garage with Hammy, and he becomes paralyzed. I begin to panic, and Brian comes outside as I haven't met my time limit- and sees me holding Hammy's now half-paralyzed body. Of course, this is my fault. He gives me the usual lecture about how I must have autism and will be a murderer one day.

Hammy is alive and okay

Finally, and eventually I see a large tank of water, with something dark floating in it. I peer inside, and it's hammy. He had drowned in it, and you could see his claw marks where he tried to climb out. Who knows how long he had been floating. Logically, Brian told me this was my fault and I wasn't allowed to have pets after that. But I began to make friends at the church he took our family to. 

A few years pass, drank his soda, left a towel on the floor... He would do things such as ripping open the shower curtain and punching my naked body until I was curled into a ball on the bottom of the tub, or forcing me outside in my underwear when it was raining and under 60 degrees.

But it gets worse than just animals.

I knew this was a person I wanted to avoid

Then, sitting in my freaking classroom. Great. I attempted evasive maneuvers in the beginning, lagging behind until he left, or gtfoing as soon as I could. 

Eventually though, figuring I could just ignore all calls and texts. However, I knew I made a mistake immediately because he then said, ""Answer when I call.""

...

That is not a question or suggestion, he had called me 3 times in 10 minutes. This was MINUTES after we had just talked. I texted him and said that I was on the phone, what did he need. He replied that he wanted to hang out. I told him that I work nights (true and I thought it was the perfect excuse) and that I couldn't hang out during the day because school and work were my priorities and I didn't have free time. He responded, ""Great! I work nights too, lets hang out Monday.""

....

I again told him no

The next day he texts me and says ""Want to hang out Monday?"" This is the same freaking Monday he has already asked about and I said no to. I replied the same way. I do not have time to hang out, so I even changed my parking area so I could walk out with a male friend from class to the same parking lot he was in.

Texted me a few days later asking me to come over. I asked why, but I am feeling really uncomfortable and I would like you to delete my number and stop contacting me."" He asked what he did, I repeated myself, he said okay.

Things were good. About a week or so went by with no issues or contact. Then

In no pleasant or diplomatic manner I told him, louder each time. He kept saying he needed a ride home, why couldn't I give him a ride home? Eventually, when it was clear he wasn't moving (he is laughing this whole time like a freaking maniac), I jumped out of my car and yelled (in a public college parking lot) ""SOMEONE GET THIS GUY OUT OF MY FUCKING CAR."" I was very quickly not alone and the guy scrammed. I then texted him and said if he ever contacted me again I was calling the police and filing stalking and harassment charges.

Thankfully

I have now learned my lesson. I don't care if you don't seem like a creeper

TLDR: Got stalky text messages and was followed to my car after class until I told him to stop. He then one day gets IN my car while I was in it. I freaked out and threatened him with everything I had and haven't heard from him since.

The show started around midnight

We left the theater around 3. I barely made it through the movie without falling asleep, so I feel okay closing my eyes and continuing to nap. I listen to my boyfriend pump gas, then drift off for a minute or two while he goes inside. 

When I hear the bell of the gas station door open, snapping his fingers, walking directly toward the car. I panic for a second before I see my boyfriend leaving the gas station building and heading toward the car (and at this point, the man.)

The man smiles at me when he sees me laying in the passenger's seat and I bolt upright, and he just glares coldly at the man and pushes his way past him to the driver's side door.  

""Hey! HEY!"" The creeper is still smiling like he just won the lottery. ""Do you know where Newtown is?!"" He's shouting at this point. I'm really unnerved because that day our community lost a lot of people, but being as how we live on the border of the state, it's not too uncommon. My boyfriend continues to stare coldly at the man and just asserts ""No,"" as he gets in the car and closes the door. The man is standing so close to the vehicle that my boyfriend bumps him with the door when he opens it.

One weekday, which was unusual, but my manager, who usually worked days with me, was out sick. No big deal, was no more than I could handle. There were people in and out all morning, and nothing out of the ordinary was happening. Until a transfer truck pulls in, but it wasn't unusual to have big trucks pull in for drinks

The driver walks in. Tall guy, and asked me if there was fresh coffee, and could he refill his mug. I told him no problem. He fills his mug, and comes up to pay, and starts chit chatting. He told me that he had a delivery for one of the factories up the street, and asked what would be the best way to get in there, so I told him. No big deal

He then started telling me he was from Arkansas, and pointed to where it was, but did not come out from behind the counter. He starts trying to chat with me again, without going to the restroom. He asked me if I was working alone, and that's when all kinds of signals start going off in my head. I told him my coworker had to run an errand and would be right back. 

He winds up staying in there for about 20 minutes, customers were coming in and out, and when someone would come in, he would walk around the store, kind of behind the shelves. At this point, I am trying to stay calm, and figure out what I need to do to get him the hell out of there!

I looked out at the gas pumps, I was trying to start a conversation, and ask him stupid questions to get him to look at my face, so I could gesture where creepy-guy was standing, behind the potato chips. He didn't catch the hint until he walked out of the door, and turned back to look at me, and I mouthed to him

He turns around and comes back in, and I say yes. All of this being said very low, where creepy-guy cannot hear. All of a sudden forklift-guy runs around the chips, and slams creepy-guy into the Coke cooler, telling him that the lady wants him to leave, GTFO!! 

Creepy-guy, and hightails it out of there, while forklift-guy stays with me until I call police, and they get there. I make a report, gave best description I could, called a coworker to come and stay with me, and the police and forklift-guy leave. 

About an hour later, and no way did he have time to get to the factory, unload, and get back out to where he was pulled over in that amount of time), but he also had pistol that had been reported stolen in Alabama, AND had just been released from prison, where he had served 2 years for rape, or what the hell he was doing in small town Georgia

One day an older man, but I don't judge.  He must have looked around, because he started talking to me about how great the store was.  He started talking about specific items from the women's side, asking if I liked them or wore them.  The ones he pointed out were corset-type tops, or had straps all over them (the ""bondage"" style was big at the time).  i kept the conversation going, saying things like ""no that's not exactly my style"" or whatever, just doing my best to stay friendly but not too personal.  I suppose the clothing conversation was his attempt to segue into a conversation about his mistress and BDSM.  He told me specific things that she did to him, I was trying not to judge

He came in another time i was working and, and women were entirely superior to the men in the group.  he said even in terms of a water bottle... a woman could drink from a man's water bottle, but not the other way around.  He said his wife didn't know he did this, but it's OK because she wouldn't do it for him, so of course he'd have to go somewhere else to get it.  At one point he brought his hand up -- I think we were going to shake hands -- and he was visibly shaking, like he was afraid to touch me.

Of course, at the time I was curious about what ""gift"" he got me, though obviously I'm glad he didn't come back to try to give it to me and I wouldn't have accepted it.

Priya and I were fine and could handle the liquor we had ingested til then, but Mallika was blacked out drunk, she had puked several times and could barely stand on her feet.

So here we are, with blaring music and tinted windows. The four of us got into the car, on the back seat, with Mallika near one of the doors in order for her to be able to puke if she needed to.

Then comes the guy's friend; the car starts, and influent enough to elude the compulsory frisking at the entrance. I get more and more worried, and start telling Jean, in french, as calmly as I can ""This guy has a gun""; from where he is, he can't see it, and he does not believe me. Priya can see I'm startled. I ask Jean ""Do you know even these guys' names? Do you have any precise idea where we're heading?"", we're tired, then Priya tells him ""Why do you have a gun in your car? It is worrying us a bit"", and the guy kept the gun on his lap. The two guys start mumbling to each other in Hindi

Thankfully, Priya tells the guys in front ""Oh no, Mallika is going to puke, stop, stop!"", even though she was just passed out on the window and had no idea what was happening. These guys, whatever their intentions were, so they stopped 20 meters away from the gate.

Neither of them had jumper cables, so there was nothing the man could do, yet he didn't leave. He stuck around and started talking to John, asking him some weird questions. The one John most distinctly remembered was him asking what John's religion was. John started to get some creepy vibes off the guy, and he tried to put his car between them. At that point two police cars pulled over behind them. One officer went up to John and forcefully grabbed his arm. He told him to get back in his car, and lock the doors. It turned out they had run both license plates

I excitedly said to my mom
""No

When they opened the trunk

""I don't know
""Right
""Holy shit.""

I was on a subway platform so that I could transfer to a new line when all of a sudden someone comes up next to me. I was reading so I didn't look up until they got pretty close and I suddenly hear someone speaking.

""I really like your shoes.""

I look up to see a man standing next to me. He'd probably be about 5'5"", especially since his teeth were incredibly crooked, but I rolled with it as best as I could, trying to be polite.

""Oh. Thank you.""

He leaned in closer. ""Where did you get them?""

Now, I was immediately on alert. I could tell this guy was up to something. Anyway, I told him where I got them, and he proceeded to talk to me about the book I was reading and about how it was one of his favorites. I was going to say something like ""Oh yeah? Tell me. What's it about?"" But, like I said, I wanted to be polite. But in order to make him get the hint that I didn't want him there, I stuck with one-word answers

""You're a really nice girl. See

Now I was on FULL alert. I could tell in no time that he was just saying that to get closer to me (he was assuming 'oh

""I could be your best gay friend! Ohmygod that would be so cool! Do you like gum? I have some gum, smiling that smile, and I was trying to nonchalantly scoot away.

I was getting more creeped out my the second, there are a lot of weirdos out there on the streets!"") and suddenly leaned forward and hugged me. This was going TOO FAR, of course, since he was invading my personal space. But I was so taken aback that I stood there for a second, frozen in place. And before I could respond and tell him to get the fuck off, he started to hump my leg.

Yes. He was humping my leg.

I immediately pushed him away and backed up

""Oh, I'm gay, but I just LOVE girls!""

I was so fucking thankful that the train came at that moment, I'll see you around honey!"" while I boarded the train, and I could see a huge, slimy grin on his face out of the corner of my eye.

I made sure to always check over my shoulder to see if he was following me for the rest of the day

I'm a female and live in a fairly small town. Most of the time I feel pretty safe doing things on my own. I have a house full of kids

 
I get there and because of the time it was pretty empty. Just a few stragglers here and there for a late night snack. I had a recipe in mind for the next day and only needed a few scattered items. As I went down the aisle for the first thing on my list, small town, didn't think much about it, as I do it all the time. My next item was several aisles away, so I got what I needed and carried on. I get to my next item and as I look up, I see the same man again. Not looking at the shelves, but directly at ME. Still wasn't OVERLY concerned, so I was there for a few minutes. I look up and there he is again. Looking directly at me. At this point

 I went to the main aisle leading to the front and walk straight ahead as if I'm leaving the store. I glance back about halfway to the front and sure enough, thinking that surely he'll just carry on now, as it would be too obvious to turn around and follow me. I get what I need and look around. Nowhere in sight. I head to the register and breathe a sigh of relief...until I get there.


This store has several ""self checkout"" lanes. I go to one, trying not to panic and hoping he'll just finish and get out!! Then I realize something and I feel relief...all I have is my checkbook. Which means a manager has to check me out because the self checkouts only take cash and cards. I call one over and get her help. Now she has to suspend my entire order and move it to her register and I have to fill out a check. MORE than enough time for this guy to finish what he's doing and be gone. But he manages to slow down and wait until I'm completely done. By this time, I'm visibly shaken and trying to stall until he leaves. He sees  this and leaves by the opposite door, meanwhile watching me the whole way.

 I stayed right where I was and waited for two other families to finish checking out. I put my keys in my hand and all my bags on my arm. As soon as they walk out, look up and see him just getting into his truck the next aisle over, directly in front of me. I start the car and am on the other side of the parking lot before he can even start his truck. I took a long way home in case he saw where I went, but I never saw him after that.

This happened a couple weeks ago on the way back from picking him up from school. He just turned 4 and his little legs don't walk very fast, the same green Toyota is still coming in our direction. Now, if there were yellow lines splitting up the road into lanes he would have been in oncoming traffic. He pulls up next to us, as we are still walking and says ""It's a nice day, isn't it?"" I thought it was weird that he didn't turn like he seemed to want to do but answered ""Yes it is"" holding  my sons hand protectively we walked a little faster. The guy pulled off and continued slowly up the street like he was watching us out of one his mirrors till he finally turned. 

After the guy turned I blew it off and continued our walk home. Relaxing and going back to talking with my son about school and what he had learned that day. When we get about five minutes from home the car silently came up from behind us and commented on how long of a walk it is for us and that ""the little boy must be very tired."" I was scared now, to which I said that we didn't live far and that we took this walk often. I took my sons arm and continued walking quickly without looking at the guy, just wanting to get home. I saw the Toyota take off and turn down our street. Then as we were approaching the apartments that we live in, I saw the car driving in and out of the parking lots like he was looking for us and where we might live.

I'm a 22 year old female weighing in at 110 pound, but on this particular day I'd forgotten it on my dresser.

It was around 11am on a Wednesday morning when I decided to head off to Walmart to pick up a few things for dinner that night. I knew I wouldn't be there long

At first, unfamiliar feeling of dread and nervousness, mixed with that uncomfortable feeling you get when someone is staring at you. 
Although the feeling of being watched wasn't something new (I often have to deal with the gawking of creeps)
I felt threatened. All of my senses went into overdrive as I scanned my surroundings for danger and I found myself wishing I hadn't left my gun at home. 
After looking around
I'm not too sure how much time had passed because that's what happens at Walmart
I was beginning to pick up a box of yogurt when I heard a man's voice from behind me say, I simply replied with a soft, ""yes?"". I was asked to follow them.
I'm not sure every Walmart has this
This is the room they lead me to. 
Still confused. I walked in and sat on the chair the officer pointed at. 
There were two other officers inside
I literally could not even process what these men eventually told me. I can't remember what was said word-for-word

Basically, but as he continued watching he noticed the guy would kind of draw back or quickly look at random products on the shelves every time I turned my head in his direction. He definitely knew this guy was a weirdo when he pulled out his phone and started to aim it at me as if to take pictures. The employee finally decided to alert a manager, told him to see for himself and they decided to tell the police working there. 

They asked the guy to go with them and I don't know how they ended up getting this out of him because they didn't go into too much detail about that
He had been sending pictures of me and texts describing me to another person. The texts said things like, long black hair, fair skin"" also my estimated bra size, etc. 
Not only that
They asked me if I wanted to see the pictures and texts
I was taken to the police station where they informed me that the men worked for people in Mexico who ran a human trafficking operation. These guys (and others who worked with them) would hang out at random places looking to fill ""orders"". Once they found a person who fit the description of an ""order""

My husband and my dad were filled in and the cops offered to have a couple of cops watch over my house for the night

It finally dawned on me that this person obviously wasn't supposed to be in my house and I starting asking

So I was a normal kid in high school, we're going to call her Agnes. She was a girl who was classified as ""Weird"". I would always see Agnes walking to classes, eating lunch, that sort of thing all by herself, so I decided that I would walk with her to class one day, thinking, ""What could possibly go wrong!"" Lots of stuff could go wrong. Lots. 

She seemed okay at first, and one at about 7pm.  They would never tell me who they were, they just called themselves ""The masked watcher"" Freaky, right? They knew everything about me. My schedule, my address, when and where all of my classes were, etc. I later found out from her only friend that Agnes was The masked watcher, I told Agnes that I knew it was her

It was about a week later when she started sending texts again. She would say something like hey, she would text back about 30 minutes later, rinse later repeat. 

I told her that she was kind of getting on my nerves, she would call me. Every 10 minutes. She would just leave voicemails that ranged from her crying, to screaming, to taking deep breaths, to confessing her love to me. I also got a few death threats from her. 

By this time she was already stalking my twitter, basically any thing that I had an account on she was there. She would even send me messages over XBox Live. By this time, I was doing anything I could to get her to stop,  but it just seemed to be getting worse. Sometimes at night I would catch glimpses of her staring into my window, then she would bolt off. And we lived like 30 minutes away. (I know this because in one of her crazed voicemails she gave me her address and told me that she was ""Ready for me"") I started to find letters in the mail that were splattered with blood saying ""I cut for you"", which was also written in blood. (Sadly I would throw them out immediately so I do not have any pictures)

Unfortunately, although I still get messages from random reddit accounts that I am sure are her, saying things like, ""Im waiting for you"" or ""You havent escaped me""

Comes back from class one day and notices that her stuff was not how it was when she left, etc and there was a picture on her floor of a little black boy (whom she had never seen before). Enough was out of place that she was way weirded out and she called the police. 

Police come to investigate cant find any evidence of breaking and entering and they ask if they can take her computer. They take it

1342732455.0,wu6le,A neighbor with a grudge,Flying_Clutz,223,27,26,"I posted this in response to another string recently but I thought I'd fix it up and put it here. 

I lived in a 3rd floor flat (apartment takes up the entire floor) of a smallish 4-story building. 1st floor was a Laundromat


I'd lived there for a little over a year when the screaming started. It's hard to describe, repetitively, for what seemed like hours. Completely unnerving. This was peppered among various roars, screeches, and generalized smashing on the floor/walls/furniture.


There was this lady that would come around to see him from time to time that had multiple scabbed over sores on her face . Sometimes I could hear her voice cooing to him along with the screaming.


I would hear this noise at all hours of the day and night intermittently for about a month. It was completely creepy to come up the stairs and walk down the hallway outside his apartment to the next flight. Sometimes a whole day would go by and it would be quiet. I figured scabby-face was probably a prostitute and/or some sort of drug addict and they were getting high on something ridiculous and/or doing some crazy bondage stuff. 

The smashing on the walls was the way that I got the landlord to care about what was going on. 

The noise was terrifying at times but most frequently just plain annoying. Soon enough

I went out of town again a couple days later, sorta medicinal smell in the hallway which got my hackles up. On the 1st landing there was one of those kidney shaped hospital buckets with some linens wadded up in it, a pack of marlboros, and some paperwork.


When I got to my landing

At this point I should explain that I was a 29 year old

""What are YOUUUU Dooing HEEERRRE!?!?"" he screamed at me.
""Going home."" I replied with a calm I was rather proud of. 

Then I continued to head toward my door with my keys out. Not sure why I didn't just turn around

He wrenched my right arm and threw me into the wall to my right. I slid down a little bit


Then I made a run for it down the stairs. He stayed at the top. What I didn't know then was my upstairs neighbors heard me screaming and had come down to talk to him and see what the noise was about. What I also didn't know at the time is he had been outside my apartment for over an hour beforehand. He was screaming things like

As I ran


I ran out into the street and remembered that by some awesome bit of luck, turned tail and ran back into the building and stood on the inside of the building door, yelling nonsense through the window.  

My friends stuck around to keep him trapped there until the cops came. 

Soon enough the police arrived. I had also called my landlord

My right arm was raw and abraded where he had wrenched it, it honestly felt like floating into pillows.


It turns out the maintenance guy that threw him out replaced his apartment lock


The next day the cops came back to investigate the crazy dude's police brutality claim. He was trying to say that the injuries he sustained from my flailing fists were from the cops. Apparently I bruised the crap out of his chest.


I was given a 4-year restraining order against him. He spent 3 months locked in the jail's insane asylum and they let him out. I assume he went off his meds

This all happened just a few months before my 30th birthday

After that you'll celebrate every stinking birthday you get. At least I still do

Now before 2005

Fortunately, which was probably only a 10 minute walk from my front door. 

I remember my jaw dropping as I stepped into the cafe. It was dark, which a couple of guys were playing in the corner. I quickly learnt about the game and finally decided to try it myself. Oh what bliss. The internet was fast, the screen was wide and the room was dark. What more could an obnoxious 11 year old kid want? 

I was fascinated about the lore and the mechanics of the game. How could I have not heard it before? How amazing it was to be a virtual man in a virtual world! I realised that time was coming by faster and faster and I was asking for more and more spare change from my sister. It's funny how she never found it odd... 

One particular day, I was decent at that time (average player) and this seemed to piss him off. This obese guy in his 20's seems to be pissed off that I have such a ""newb"" account on Runescape and is determined to show off his account, which I admit at the time was admirable. Everytime I looked at his screen, he'd mutter under his breath things like ""mind your own"" and ""do you mind?"". I didn't seem to be concerned at his weird behavior but I guess I was 11 years old at that time so I'm excused. 

As time goes on (as in weeks and months), the guy screams something like ""This f***ing kid is trying to steal my skittles!"". What an asshole I thought. The guy at the desk comes to the scuffle and he tells me to move somewhere else. I agree and this obese guy is still giving me dirties. 

Skip ahead, it was like an unofficial school friends server) and I don't reply because I don't have his name on my friends list. This goes on for ages, and I never stopped to think how awkward it was for him to be cussing me out in a game, from across the room. 
I would have reported him if he used bad language but he never did

Suddenly one day out of nowhere, if you die to someone else, you lose all your stuff in your bag. So basically, this idiot thinks he can trick me into going into the Wilderness with him and then lure me far enough to kill me and claim his title and pride. Well all I can remember was that our in-game level differences were very little and I spent my time in-game doing quests/grinding while the fat man sat in-game doing irrelevant things, which explains why I had caught up within a few months of starting.
Back to the cafe, we are all private IMing in-game so neither can see what we type to either people.
On with the plan
We go finally reach the wilderness and we go heaps far into the wilderness and I remember we were lost in and I tell Chris to ask the mean guy if ""they"" wanna jump me instead. Chris asks. Immediately

Skip ahead to 1 year later

""You are lucky you didn't come back"". I remember this vividly. I didn't reply and I tried to ignore him.
""I wish I could kill you in real life""
I immediately filed a report on him to Jagex and he was banned a week later

I can't imagine what would happen if I went back to the cafe. Or if he saw me eating with my parents at the food court.

To all people who are offended by the term fat

1375475715.0,1jl50e,A chase never truly begins until you start running.,ally-saurus,225,30,36,"I had mostly forgotten about this story until someone linked me to this subreddit; after thoroughly creeping myself out for a few days I decided to contribute as well. 

For many years, and I'm not overly afraid of walking around in some of my city's more infamous areas at night, but I think it's important to respect the city you're in, and I knew that this southern city was quite a bit more dangerous for me to walk around alone in, especially as a young petite woman (5'0"", 105lbs; I'm pretty strong, a lot stronger than people think by looking at me, in my summer city

But as often happens, driving like two minutes, then two minutes back, and then disarming the security system again, etc, and I just felt...silly. Like a scared little girl. So I said, ""Nah, I only live a few blocks away."" And I went on my merry way.

I walked with my head up, just like I do back home. I got one block, and then another. It was a gorgeous night and I let myself enjoy it and relax a little bit, as I hoped in vain for a gentle breeze to cool me off a little, and enjoyed the symphony of the various insects that came out at night. It was ungodly humid and I didn't see a single other person - definitely a different type of city than NYC - but I could hear the gentle hum of nightlife from the main drag one avenue over. I got a third block. And then I saw another person.

A man. 

""Of course, after all; why didn't a man have the same right? But - and this has never happened to me before or since - something about the sight of that man, THAT specific man, terrified me.

I couldn't tell you why. He was in his mid-20s, most of the white people are in bed, or in groups heading to or from the bar together (of course, then again, I'm white too, so...). He looked like a surfer, not a stalker. He actually looked pretty cute - and yet I could hardly bear to look at him, but it really just struck me - how much this guy DID NOT look like the sort of guy who would terrify me

He was walking towards me, and yet when I was about 20' away from him, I stopped. I don't know why. I just really, really didn't want to walk past him. It almost felt like I couldn't make myself go any closer.

""This is ridiculous, embarrassed by my behavior. But, just to ease my mind, I crossed the street, feeling foolish. 

And then

""Don't come any closer to me, how it was exactly what I felt and exactly what I wanted most in the world at that moment, translated into words: DON'T COME ANY CLOSER TO ME. How it was a command, not a request. DON'T. I had never heard myself sound so sure of anything before in my life, honestly. My voice was the first real sound I'd heard in several minutes and I was surprised at how loud it felt, breaking the tension and finally starting ""this"" - whatever ""this"" was. He looked like it startled him, too.

""Don't be scared

""I'm not scared, looking at each other.

""Please

""There's a gas station one block over

""I'm not from here and I had too much to drink and I don't want to get lost, when if he was the one who needed help you'd think he would have said something first; the weirdness of someone going out alone and getting drunk on their own in a strange city, instead of hanging out with friends or drinking moderately or anything like that. I know it's not impossible - I've traveled alone myself and enjoyed my own company in plenty of bars - but it all just seemed like a bunch of relatively less-than-common stuff, and all taken together, it made me wary. He continued, ""Will you walk to the gas station with me? Or can I borrow your phone?""

""No, and you'll be at a very busy road with a gas station on your lefthand side."" 

""Please, like how you approach a cat. ""Seriously, what's wrong with you? I just need HELP.""

I thought of my Leatherman and my flick knife

""I told you, ""don't come closer to me."" I stepped backwards and hated myself for doing it; it felt like a sort of mini-surrender. He took another step forwards.

""I won't hurt you

I began crossing the empty street again, ""I'll scream. There is a cop who is stationed on a bike four blocks away. He's there every night, and he will hear me scream. He will be here in seconds. You really should turn right at this corner; it will take you directly to the gas station.""

""If you say so, of whether, in his ambiguity, he was referring to the location of the gas station or location of the police officer. He didn't start walking. I stood there, on the other side of the street, wary of taking my eyes off him. But he didn't start walking.

So I did. I walked until we were directly across the street from each other and then I walked further. I glanced at him over my shoulder after a few steps and he was still there

I walked a few more steps and glanced over my shoulder at him again. He was still standing there. I picked up the pace and went a ways further. Looked back. He was gone. Completely gone. He had to have moved quickly, moving that quickly, without me watching? I didn't think he could have crossed the whole street AND managed to hide somewhere, at least not without me hearing. I glanced at the sidewalk across from me. It was lined with trees and bushes; there were massive gardens all along it, all kinds of yards and stuff like that; there were almost no streetlights, and so many shadows. He could be anywhere. 

I thought about turning down a side street and heading towards the main drag where all the bars and restaurants were. I glanced down one as I passed. No streetlights at all, just like I was - nothing more. I even managed to work up some guilt over not doing more to help him. I like to think of myself as a good person and it bothered me that I had been so rude to someone who really might have needed help. But at the same time, I just couldn't quite make myself relax about it. 

I wanted to run

Finally, if it ever would be. I sprinted, and then as my panic grew I pushed even faster down that last block. 

The cop heard me running his way before he really saw me. ""Are you okay, straddling his bike, peering out at me.

""Yes, sorry. I just got scared."" I smiled an apology and began to make fun of myself, the way we so often do when we feel stupid, but the cop was already looking behind me, over my shoulder.

""Sir?"" he called

""No thanks, looking.

I can only think that he followed me after all, to keep up, even though full-on running meant abandoning his ""cover."" 

""Do you know him?"" the cop asked.

""No, I felt a twinge of guilt.

I waited for the man to come closer, not him. He said nothing. He waved, then turned around and started walking the other way. He didn't look back. I waited with the police officer and we watched him walk for several minutes, and then I asked the cop to escort me to my home a block away. When we got to my front door, the cop asked me if I was okay, or if I wanted to make a formal statement. I couldn't really think of what I would even say - I was out walking alone and I saw another person out walking alone and I yelled at him when he asked me for help? and then he followed me? and all I really know is he was blond? - and I was a bit shocked and stunned, so I said no, too scared to turn on the lights for fear that they would render me visible from the street. 

It wasn't until I was already laying down, if HE hadn't been forced to run and thus abandon the silent but uneven cover of the shadows and trees, would the police officer have seen him at all? Or would he have remained hidden, watching me, following me right up to my very doorstep, lurking in my own bushes as I climbed the stairs to the porch and fought to get the key in the lock? Would I have waved to the cop bravely, speed-walking my way home, with that man slithering behind me the whole time

There were a lot of people at the store, she went on her way. She arrived at the bowling alley about 45 minutes later, and good times were had by all.

I was on the bus on my way back from school, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a middle aged woman standing up and moving out of her seat to sit next to me. Nothing too weird. About 2 seconds later, a man (who somewhat resembled Russell Crowe when he played John Nash in a Beautiful Mind) followed quickly after her and sat in front of her. He kept talking to the woman but I assumed they were friends. About two seconds later she stood up and yelled ""I DON'T KNOW YOU. LEAVE ME ALONE."" and moved back to her original spot. I wasn't sure what was going on, but the man stared at me and I got chills down my spine, I shrugged it off as paranoia. I pulled out my phone so I'd look busy and unapproachable, and he got up and followed the woman. I was kind of relieved he didn't talk to me, but still felt nervous for the woman. When it was my stop, but the man was still onboard. I stepped off the bus
This really freaked me out because it was a snowstorm, and I'd be at my dentist's office so I wasn't too worried. I was waiting for the light to turn green so I could cross, when out of the corner of my eye, I see him smiling at me. And this is when I nearly cried.
""Hey."" he says
""Don't you think it would be so much better if we just got along instead of all this...fighting?"" he said, what?"" and he responds, ""We should really just stop fighting and get along. We're so perfect when we don't fight. I don't know why you don't see that."" I was frozen, and the damn signal light wouldn't change so I couldn't move. I just started inching away. ""Why don't we go somewhere and talk it out, you know? We should just get along instead of all this..fighting."" he repeated.
Needless to say, nor did I want to. About 30 seconds of running, I looked back reluctantly and saw him still standing at the street light, but he wasn't looking at me.

We met the day before Kindergarten and had the good fortune of getting the same teacher. We were more or less attached at the hip until the end of the 3rd grade. My great grandmother had passed that January


Being a kid with two working parents, only the occasional birthday party. After 2 years, we sort of stopped talking altogether out of mutual busyness. 
Another 2 years after that, her older brother(who had just gotten his license and a car), and her brother's lady friend showed up at my house to surprise me. They took me out for pizza, we went to the mall, I was overjoyed when my mom gave me permission to stay the night at her house. 


So we're on our way home, he hangs up and tells Jade that she must've forgotten that it was their weekend to have cousin Jimmy over. The look of horror on Jade's face is not something I'll ever forget. She looks at me, and she looks like she's going to cry.


""Oh gosh


I didn't understand. I'd met Jimmy when we were much younger. I told him he was going to marry a boy once, it wouldn't spoil our time or anything, she tells me I really don't get it. On the way to pick him up, she filled me in what he was like then. 


Apparently, and unfortunately, girls. She'd started by telling me that she'd found quite a few pairs of her panties in his room at her grandmother's(where Jimmy lived), as well as some dead rats and birds. That he'd walk in on her when she was in the shower and play it off as an accident, shit like that. Then she told me that it'd gotten worse recently, that he'd assaulted her once before and her brother had to pull him off of her. She said he didn't get any further than groping, which was good


As it was told to me, he had ripped her underwear off was trying to, well, get it in when her brother had busted down the door.


Needless to say, but I put on my brave face and told her that I'd be fine. 


We get to the house to pick up Jimmy, y'know), nothing *too* creepy, but enough to make me extremely uncomfortable. So we roll up to her house, her mother greets us, asks how things have been, yadda yadda. We decided to sit outside, and talk for a bit. Half an hour or so passes, and I'd move my chair further


We ended up watching Harry Potter, the norm. When it came time to lie down, I asked her if we could lock her door, and she tells me the locks broken from the incident with Renee. So I died a little inside and attempted to swallow my fear, and lied down. I didn't sleep. About 3am, I hear a door open down the hall. A few seconds later, Jimmy slowly and quietly opens the door. He stood there for close to a fucking half hour. Then, that she was going to get her mom


Fast forward a few sleepless hours, which we didn't realize until after we'd told her we'd just stay there. So her mother leaves, and Jade asks if I want to get a shower. After she'd told me of her experience with Jimmy 'accidentally' walking in on her, I politely decline, and she says I can do whatever while she gets one. So, I shut myself in her room, and start doing my hair/make-up. A few minutes later


He starts telling me how pretty he thinks I am, I just kept at my makeup and try to acknowledge him as little as possible. 


At this point, I jumped up on the bed and jumped off the other side and darted to her parents bathroom and locked myself in. He didn't follow me in there. 


After 15 minutes, but I assured her it wasn't a big deal and not to be so upset about it, though it was one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me and I think of it often.

I am female, obviously, a couple days long. This isn't incredibly creepy, but it was really close. 

Being the closest of age, and her 6 year old brother hung out together during the course of the wake. Being stupid, insensitive little snot rags, we would play noisily during the funeral and generally be stupid, insensitive little snot rags. We eventually got bored. Seeing as how there was a playground right next to the funeral, we cleverly decided to head there. At night. 

So we were playing, maybe in his 20s. He had bowl-cut hair and was kind of dumpy. Not very fat, just a little chubby. I think he chatted with us and played with us a little. My memory is hazy, so I don't remember what happened exactly before he said he had somewhere fun to take us. He scooped my 6 year old cousin up and started walking away. Fast. My 7 year old cousin and I didn't get suspicious. Instead, we followed him, thinking he was really going somewhere fun. In hindsight, what we didn't realise was that he was only interested in my male cousin when we were talking and his speed - he was trying to shake us girls off. 

This weirdo stopped a distance away, because I was pretty shocked by one of my older cousins' reaction. 

Someone snatched my cousin from the guy's hands. Somehow they dragged this guy from the playground to the nearest void deck. One of the older cousins, went berserk. Overcome by the loss of his dad and the fact that someone just tried to snatch another family member, he grabbed the guy and pummelled all his rage and anguish into that guy. My dad and some uncles pulled my cousin back, but not before he got some punches in. 

I don't know if my cousin is traumatized by it. He's pretty sullen and quiet during gatherings, I think they just let him go so that there would be no drama caused. Back then, I had no idea what it all meant exactly. I knew about kidnap, but now, I realise how close my cousin was to being kidnapped by a homosexual pedo. None of us ever spoke about that ever. Honestly though, I doubt any of them even remember. 

TL;DR: Guy tried to snatch my 6 y/o cousin at a funeral

This was also a time of heavy drug abuse


Through mutual friends we meet Fred.5'7,not really a hit with the ladies. His friend tells us he's been a loner pretty much throughout high school and has a bit of trouble making friends,so we take him under our wing and start hanging out on a daily basis with him,all while getting to know of his..quirky personality. Nothing really strange,just some awkward stuff he does/says,but we brush it off as being a result of his loneliness through school. 


Not long after we learn that he basically hates his father and lives with his mother,because it really makes him uneasy when we do,and again its totally understandable. So instead,we did what we did best at that time,and that was to smoke weed.he already smoked prior to meeting us,mind you.


As time goes on he starts smoking more and more and begin acting much weirder,fasting,hyperventilating,etc. He once spiced a blunt with morphine(he stole from his mom's cabinet) and had us smoke it without telling us. His mother passed away shortly after,and we were asked by him to go with him to his mom's funerals. He kept giggling and making jokes during service,which we found a bit weird..but to each his way to cope,right ?After his mother passed he fell down even harder in drugs,wanted to be ad high as possible all the time,his dad was a laid back hippy looking guy.


We begin hanging out less often with him and i kinda take pity on him. I hang out with him one on one,out of the blue,he tells me he found one his mother was a closet lesbian when he went through her stuff after she passed,shows me a ring she left him and tells me to try it. As im putting the ring on i take notice of this huge knife on the counter.knowing his background,i ask him why's the knife out and he makes his way down the hall,to the living room and moves a sofa - He wanted to get smokes but his father had locked his room because he was tired of having his smokes stolen from his son.next logical step?well *cut a fucking 3x3 hole in the wall,of course!* i told him it was the most dumb thing he could have done


A couple of weeks pass and we simply stop answering his phone calls altogether,only rollerblades. From there,we saw him pop his head in windows a couple of times. Became a running gag amongst us,dont say his name three times or he'll appear! And that kind of shit. 


Until i get a voicemail from him. Where he's crying


He then started sending me emails..really,that he was gay because the ghost of her mother told her to be one just like her,that the ring had to be on seven fingers and that he was totally ok with the fact that i didnt came out of the closet yet,he knew deep down i loved him back.(im straight as can be,also had a girlfriend throughout all of this) The next set of emails would be sent to my friends also,saying how much girls were after him and that he was the total playboy and that we were total faggot assholes for installing cameras in his shower. He also wanted 5 of my friends to try on the ring so it'd make seven,his mother would be so proud! 


After a couple of those nonsense emails me and my friends met up and did the smartest thing we should of done much earlier: get him help. So we printed out an email and went to see his father


So he gets sent to a psychiatric ward and two months later he gets out,we meet with him and catch up. He tells us the pills make him ""neutral"": never really sad,but never really happy either. He also tells us he tried smoking weed with the pills,but it makes him freak out way too much,so he decides to lay off the drugs for good. We congratulate him and let him know we're very proud of him for his recovery and that if he needs anything to give us a call. we dont hear from him for a couple of days,until we learn that he stopped taking his meds altogether so he could continue his drug use.. We said fuck it,if you dont want to help yourself in the first place we wont lose our time trying to help you..


All 6 of us stopped taking drugs after that ordeal

the first part of my story. (Oh lord I hope the link shows up

So in my previous post, and for some reason my mom let me talk her out of getting a restraining order against him first thing. As stupid as it sounds, I really didn't want to lose the friendship I had built up with his sister. So all I wanted to do was forget about my bad experience. 

Everything was normal for the next couple months. I never saw Artie around town and he never texted me or tried to contact me. I was starting to feel safe again. Ivonne (his sister) and I were still really close, so I wouldn't have to do a lot of driving whenever I wanted to go somewhere.

I was busy making summer plans and doing other teenage girl stuff

Weeks later, I hadn't even talked to Artie since our date. Not one phone call. Not one text. Nothing. A calmly asked my mom to explain why she thought I was talking to Artie. What she told me still sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it.

Apparently, they hardly ever turn guest away, and when they do, it always for a good reason. Artie didn't even give them a chance to send him away though. He just walked into their house and sat himself down on their couch. Weird, right? My mom tried to tell him that I wasn't home. He told her he knew, that he had called me earlier that morning, and I said that I was coming over in a little bit. He told them that we wanted to have a ""family dinner"" with them

He asks my stepdad for his permission to date me, he didn't approve at all. Artie choked at first (lol thanks, Kramanos!) but then he laughed and told Dave that he was hilarious, like what my stepdad said was a joke. My parents couldn't get Artie to leave, so they all just sat around for about two hours, waiting for me to show up. When it became apparent that I wasn't showing up, my parents finally threatened to call the cops. Artie got the message and left. Later my mom called me to ask me what was going on. When I explained to her that I hadn't talked to him in months, she was just as freaked out as I was.

1353472882.0,13jttk,My boyfriend tried to kill me under the influence of drugs when I was 16. ,houseofLEAVEPLEASE,255,63,57,"I'm not sure how relevant this story is to the thread

When I was 16 I made the monumentally bad decision to run away from home and live with my boyfriend at the time (""Brad, and her boyfriend (Ivan, 23). I can't even being to enumerate all of the ways in which this was a horrible idea and a bad situation, but I was a very stupid teenager and it seemed adventurous and fun and I was exhilarated by the lifestyle these men were living. 

My absolute best friend at the time (also my age, and Christy and Alex were staying in the master bedroom for the weekend. There were several ""white caps"" in Alex's most recent batch and those were the ones that we were eating. 

Over the course of a couple of hours my boyfriend and I were growing restless with how long it was taking for the drugs to kick in and, very uncomfortable, very intense trip. I remember that it took the drugs longer to hit my boyfriend, so he had to watch over me for about an hour while I had a temporary psychological breakdown. I won't go into what I experienced during the trip because that really isn't the point of the post but, against advice, I ended up forcing myself to throw up everything that I could to end the trip as quickly as possible. Alex and Christy were already in bed. 

After I'd thrown up and was,  I went to lie down with my boyfriend in the dark, and that was when he started tripping. He was thinking very cyclically and repeating the words to Tool songs as if they were Bible passages. None of this struck me as particularly odd, for some reason, even though I'd never seen cyclical thinking to this degree during a trip and the unfamiliarity should've set off alarm bells in my head. Then the scary part started.

One minute I was doing my level best to calm him down and reassure him, but I didn't try to run immediately after he'd stopped because I was between him and a wall, and he was much, much larger than me and I was sure I wouldn't make it. Seeing no other option, I soothed him while I tried to construct an escape. 

He tried to break my neck twice more before an out presented itself. I have no idea how I survived this because he was absolutely physically capable of doing it. 

A short time after his third attempt to kill me

This was the best opportunity I'd seen to escape, clawing and writhing and screaming like a banshee. Finally, he lost his grip on me and I fell, then scrambled into the bathroom and locked the door. I vaguely remember knocking over a chair as I ran to slow him down. As soon as I'd locked the door I started to hear commotion on the other side. There was yelling and scuffling and unintelligible babbling, and then someone knocked on the door. 

I was absolutely terrified of losing my life so I ignored the knocking and started trying to figure out how to open the sealed bathroom window. After about a minute of this desperate knocking

The moment I realized that it was her, but he was wrong. My boyfriend  tackled me to the bathroom floor and redoubled his efforts to break my neck. I remember my head being twisted so far around that I could clearly see the tiny pits in the bathroom tile behind me. 

I'm incredibly lucky that Alex was there because I probably would've died if he hadn't been. He yanked my boyfriend off of me long enough for Christy to crash into the bathroom with me and lock the door behind her. I was sobbing uncontrollably, and a pair of men's boxers. Both were crusted with dried vomit.

My friend finally managed to pry the window open and we crawled outside. Covered in vomit, but I managed to give my friends a basic outline of what happened. Walter left the apartment, exclaiming that he had to find my boyfriend, and I absolutely understand that. I even somehow managed to understand it at the time. I knew that this behavior was the drugs talking, not my boyfriend, and that his safety was important. I won't say that I thought that he had as much of a claim to safety at that moment as I did because I was running on adrenaline and determined to survive and not at all concerned with justice or rational fairness, but he definitely didn't deserve to be forgotten just because some drugs had affected him adversely. 

Finally, wrapped in a black curtain with pupils the size of saucers. My friends sat back as he settled onto the couch next to me and started apologizing profusely for what he'd done. I listened for a couple of minutes, my body as tense and rigid as it had ever been, when he started to slip back into cyclical thinking. I learned then, through his rambling, that he'd tried to kill me because he thought that God had told him that he had to kill me so that we could be together in heaven. 

After I lost the ability to deal with the trauma and the stress, with or without my friends present. 

I ran all the way to another nearby friend's apartment and ended up staying there for the night, ever forget it.

Every year during March Break my family would drive roughly 2 hours into the city from our rural town to enjoy a college basketball tournament. We routinely stayed at a large, this year was different; there had been a rash of violent muggings and swarmings in the downtown core of the city, which had left many severely injured. I remember reading about these attacks in the newspaper (I've always enjoyed reading the news, even as a young child) and feeling scared. Those reports rattled me in a way typical news stories didn't, possibly because I wasn't used to the threat of violence so close to home.


It was Saturday night around 11 PM and my family (mom, much more so than other moms. While it can be annoying by times, it often leaves us prepared for bad situations. Tonight would be one of those times.


I was sitting on the second of two beds


""Room service


""We didn't order anything"" said my dad as he sized up the short


""Are you sure?"" he responded. ""I've got an order here for room 4109.""


The guy at the door didn't sound pushy or out of place at all; in fact, that night my parents were certainly cautious, and my father firmly told the man at the door that we didn't order any food. He left politely, without incident.


We had little reason to be suspicious and my dad wanted to chalk it up to a mistake on the hotel's behalf and get to bed. However


""They have no record of us ordering food and their room service staff wear white, but that there was no one to be found. With that they departed and we triple checked the locks on the door before hitting the hay.


The next morning I was the first one awake. I didn't want to turn on the TV and wake my family and there was no newspaper in the room


Apparently, a pedestrian had been attacked outside our hotel in the middle of the sidewalk. He had been stabbed twice and then badly beaten in plain sight, yet his wallet wasn't stolen. The article went on to say that there was no apparent motive for the mugging; it was pure violence for violence's sake. It also mused as to why the pedestrian had been stabbed to the point where he couldn't fight back, but then beaten by hand. I woke my parents up right away and showed them the article. My mother became very nervous and checked about the room (even though it was now morning) while my dad looked very angry and reached for the phone. Naturally we contacted the police and told them our story about the previous night. We provided as much information about the man at our door as possible, thinking he may have been responsible for the assault, but no one was ever caught.

Well I left from school that day went home and went to bed. Next day I'm called into the principle's office and my mom and dad are there. The principle explained to my parents what the kid had said and said they where expelling him and thanks to my friend they stopped a bully. 

Well I went on with life and never ever saw him again and went into high school.I went through some depression and my mother told me to value my life because I'm lucky to be alive.. I asked why? 

She then explained how my friend had told the teacher right before school let out. They caught the kid as soon as he was about to leave. They searched his backpack and found a combat knife

I'm female, so I called in sick (I worked for my dad and could get away with that), and just sat in my room on the internet in the dark. I then got a big whiff of cigarette smoke. My room-mate at the time and I did not smoke, but every once in a while in the mornings while getting ready I would smell cigarette smoke faintly. I was often in a hurry and shrugged it off to just being lingering smells on my clothes from visiting smoking friends. At this time it was very strong smelling, I decided to investigate. The smell clearly was coming from my room. I decided to get a second opinion from my room-mate who stays up until morning gaming. He smelled it too and thought it originated from my slightly ajar window. He pulled back the blinds to go in for a better sniff. A silhouette outside, lit from behind by a street light, shifted away quickly. My room-mate grabbed a bat and headed outside. He found nothing. I had crappy plastic broken blinds with horizontal slits


This same event played out a couple more mornings at about weekly intervals while getting ready for work at about 5am. After returning from my shower to my room, look out the window, and get my room-mate who would go outside too late to see anyone. We devised a plan to next time not check the window. I was to go to my room-mate calmly and he would sneak out with his bat to catch the silhouette.


Another morning arrived carrying the scent of smoke. The plan worked. He caught a man with a big hood that shielded his face from view. The man made a feeble excuse about a cat, but the silhouette never returned.. that I knew of at least.

Okay

 

Just to put one thing in perspective though, it was more sloppily pasted together with duct tape, and me crossing my fingers hoping it’d stay put. That said, I have been told I am debonair in the way I dress and speak, so if you want to picture me as James Bond, go for it I guess. I guess this paragraph wasn’t all that necessary.  

 

I’m at Gordon’s house now, albeit forgetting several details. We laugh it off and he tells me that he has an old school friend staying over, Jason. I know Jason pretty well. We used to play computer games together, and he was always an odd guy, and that only got worse as he got older. He just gave off really weird vibes when he spoke and he was socially awkward as hell. I’m socially awkward but he made me look pretty normal.

 

I ask about him and Gordon tells me he’s been really strange. He’s sleeping upstairs now though so I don’t have to worry. We keep shooting the shit and I’m a few beers down when Jason comes downstairs, nothing unusual.

 

It’s about 5:30AM when I decide I should get some sleep. Also beer makes me tired as fuck, and even though he’d slept a bit, he still smelt like alcohol and was all woozy, so I wasn’t taking him too seriously. He sits on the side of the bed and starts telling me about how shitty his life has been and I’m just kind of like “Yeah, that’s cool…”

 

He’d recently been through a break up and he tells me that when he was having sex with his girlfriend she would just sort of lie there, she’d never want to cuddle. I find this fucking hilarious. He said it with so much…passion. Like he really, really wanted his ex-girlfriend to cuddle with him post-coitus. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not something guys blurt out on a usual basis. So I burst out laughing and he says “Don’t you fucking laugh.”

 

I keep laughing because I genuinely think he’s still rolling with the joke. And he turns to me and says “Stop fucking laughing, “So sleep then.” Still just chilling on the side of the bed.

 

“I’m not gonna sleep with you here; get out

 

I don’t know what happened next – I don’t know if it was just him being drunk and passing out or him doing it intentionally, and I assume he’s doing that. Despite me telling him that all I wanna do is fucking sleep he keeps jumping on me or trying to wrestle my head or some shit. So eventually, I (gasp) get really pissed off and decide to really hurt him.

 

He’s basically lying right on top of me

 

I’m not that angry but I just say “Dude get the fuck out

 

He walks towards the door, I shit you not, “I’m gonna slit your throat in your sleep.”

 

FUCK. THIS. SHIT. I facepalm and he walks out. I get up and figure there’s no fucking way I’m sleeping here. Not on a night like this. I’m gonna go home

 

I go to Gordon’s room and wake him up. I tell him what happened and say I’m just over the entire night and wanna go home. He tells me it’ll be better if I just stick it out, so I agree, he locks up, and we go to sleep.

 

Cue 7AM

 

·         Why is he standing there?

·         Did he sleep at all?

·         He probably tried to check my room to see if he could kill me

 

He doesn’t say or do anything. And I’m still stuck in that overwhelm – like I’ve spent too much time being scared to feel scared so much as just wanting to puke and then sleep because I really think that’s what I need more than anything right now. So I give it a few seconds. And I shut the door and lock it. He does the worst thing he could possibly do: nothing. If he knocked again I’d get it

 

Gordon’s room has a balcony with a glass window that looks out onto their garden which is massive, cold morning air to it, and to be honest, for those few moments I really felt okay. Even a little bit peaceful. I have a cigarette and watch the fog drifting around.

 

I head back inside after a few minutes and lie down under the blanket, when I look over to the window and god-damn-fucking-Jason is just standing there. Just creepin’. I ask what the fuck he’s doing and he says “Let me in,” so I do. He steps in and sits down and I just can’t resist asking what is wrong with him. He tells me about how upset he is about his girlfriend and I listen and tell him I totally get what he’s going through but he’s turning into a creep. He agreed and we actually had a nice talk. I ended up taking him out a few weeks later to talk to random people and get out of his shell a little bit. It didn’t work but it was funny as hell to watch, and it makes me feel really bad to say this but it was just really, really good cringe humor.

 

ANYWAYS. Jason isn’t really a concern anymore. It’s also early in the morning, they leave pretty soon after and I ask Jason to grab the remote and let me out.

 

Things finally seem pretty calm, and on this particular day, I drive down this long road that winds down a mountain pass, so a long, windy, narrow road that goes steeply downhill. Right before that though I drive past a small sky blue Diahatsu stopped, not exactly in the middle of the road, but I notice he’s sleeping – looks full on passed out

 

I’m worried he’s diabetic and randomly fainted or something, chair all the way back, just sleeping.

 

I get closer. The car smells like shit. This smell hits my face and I genuinely think this fucker shat himself and was sitting in it. There are crumbs all over his jacket and empty plastic bags scattered across the car. I snoop for at least a minute before noticing that he’s been staring at me the whole fucking time. Pretty average looking dude, “Oh shit, I thought you were asleep, sorry.”

 

He smiles. And I will never forget how creepy his smile was. Imagine a dude who smelt like shit in a tiny little blue DIahatsu smiling at you like he was The Mona Lisa. I can’t describe it. And he says “No

 

A little lost for words I point out that he’s kind of in the middle of the road and ask if he’s feeling alright. He keeps that smile up and says “Don’t worry about it. You have a good day now.” His voice was soft and empathetic. Pedo fashion. It was just really creepy. I decide to let it go and walk away

 

I remember that I’m in South Africa, so I think maybe I’ve just fallen for one. I’m walking to my car and when I look back he’s walking behind me. I get to my car and turn around to watch him. He stops right in front of me, not saying a word. That smell follows him. I’m pretty sure he was on drugs, but seriously, what drug does that? He wasn’t cocaine-active, he seemed maybe a little doped out, but there had to be something more. Maybe opiates and alcohol, and I’m still sticking to my story when I say he’d shat himself ‘cause that smell followed him.

 

He doesn’t say anything. So I do. “What?”

 

The smile came back. “Nothing.”

 

I heave a sigh and get in my car. As I drive off he puts a hand through my open window and tries to hold on but it’s so half assed that he doesn’t even step to keep up with me

 

Home was just a few blocks away. I made it. I finally had fucking made it. I opened my garage and parked my car. I closed the garage and no one had crept in. I took a deep breath and I had trouble believing I was actually home. It was fucking beautiful. I’ve never appreciated having a home before. A place that’s just safe. So I did the only logical thing I could do: I went to the kitchen, and I had a glass of red wine. Then I passed the fuck out.

 

I slept until about 10PM, ever told anyone what happened. I told them a few parts. But seriously, who the fuck would believe that all this happened in the space of less than 12 hours? I didn’t go out for a long time after that. It seemed like everything would just go wrong. I was terrified, and I still think I was justified in not really trusting the world for a while after.

 

However, which explains why he was so happy to just fight the 4 guys -- that made for some amazing stories on their own, but the whole mentality we were groomed into was that if you ever got angry with someone and didn’t do anything about it, you’re a pussy. That attitude has its place, but if I hadn’t been so damned stubborn about giving Jason shit, giving Group 2 shit, giving the Afrikaaners at the gas station shit, the night wouldn’t have been so fucking eerie. That attitude has its place

 

In a way it’s a little sad

 

All in all, at first out of fear, but later it was because it felt easier and more natural. So I’ve made a full recovery (I think) and the story is pretty damn cool. Also I think I got all my creep experiences over and done with that night because it hasn't happened since. Let me know if you guys have any questions, and once again, thank you all for taking so much interest in it!

On this particular day, I thought. The bus ride was only about 15 minutes.
I wait for the bus with about 5 other people. One of whom was an elderly man. We file on, and begin flipping through my phone to pass the time.
We get to the next stop
I wasn't sure what he was doing at first
He does this for all the women who get on for the next few stops. His voice is barely above a whisper
He keeps repeating a description of someone I can't figure out on the bus. ""White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black skirt...White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black shirt."" No one on the bus has white hair, ""He needs some help.""
Then, and I was wearing a black skirt and a white shirt. My blood runs cold. I frantically look around at the other people on the bus. No one is paying any attention to him.
""White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black skirt..""
The other chilling thing is that he wasn't looking at me at all. He was staring straight ahead the entire time. Then he starts saying something else...Something that sounds like ""wuzza shifuck..."" I strain me ears.
My stomach flips painfully in my gut. He is now saying ""Wonder if she'll fuck me...I wonder if she'll FUCK me."" He looks like he is enjoying saying the word ""fuck"". He lets it sit in his mouth for an uncomfortably long time. ""I wanna FUCK her...Fuck her..""
He continues to describe me to himself, until it lurches to a halt at my stop. I jolt up. I want to leave. Right as I get up, the man turns his head to look at me with crazy, piercing blue eyes. His unruly eyebrows quiver, as his face transforms into a half grimace, half smile.
I run off the bus. To my horror
I couldn't take it. I ran as fast I could. Every time I looked back, still muttering to himself.

I've followed this subreddit for a while now, my childhood stalker. (I'm 20/f for context's sake, btw). 

When I was a kid my mom and step-dad owned their own maintenance company. We lived out in the middle of nowhere in the south. All the neighboring towns were very small, to help out. 

Again

Enter John. John was in his mid-twenties and had only recently moved to our town from NYC. John was a bit awkward, came across as very kind hearted. I was eleven when John started working for my family. He would come and join us for meals after working for my family all day. My big sister, who was just a few years younger than John, had recently moved out west and I missed her a lot, so when John began to show interest in me I was very excited. Look at that, now I have a big brother figure who thinks my middle school drama is interesting to listen to over dinner!

My family liked John and hired him on for the next few jobs they got. John continued to be very friendly toward me

September rolls around. John has worked for my family for a couple of months by now. My birthday is coming up and my family promises to take me bowling (an hour's drive away, but John had always been nice and I didn't want to be rude and say that I didn't want him around. 

My family was also heavily involved in the local fire dept. Every year we would volunteer to do this haunted hay ride event, and could he help out? My mom, bless her heart, is the sweetest little southern lady and says of course he can, she'll put him in contact with the man who runs it. 

Well, ends up being put in the same area as my family and I because he apparently didn't want to work with strangers. Um. Okay. This is when things started getting weird. Mind you, this event required us working long, late nights out in the woods. In the beginning of the season there would sometimes be long gaps between groups. The first weekend we had a gap like that. A boy I was friends with was working the next station over, and I  told my mom I was going to go say hi to him. I took the path through the woods so in case a group came through they wouldn't see a small preteen girl covered in fake blood skipping through the woods, because that's hardly scary. As I'm walking I hear something and turn around. There's John. I ask him what he's doing and he said he saw me leave and didn't want me to get hurt. I tell him I'm fine and that my mom knows where I'm going, and that these woods are very safe (the most dangerous animals around were deer). He says he doesn't feel comfortable with me walking by myself, and said I was just going to go back to our station. The rest of the run John always managed to show up whenever I was alone to talk to me. I never mentioned this to my mom because I still felt like my dislike for John was rude; my family liked him

Fast forward to February. John hasn't been around much because most of the work hasn't required him. Then, you're the most beautiful girl I have ever see. I love you."" My mom asks me if there were any boys at school who would send me something like that. I tell her no; we exchanged carnations at school, and I had never had a boy interested in me. 

The next week John swings by (not all that unusual). While he's there he asks me if I liked my flowers. I played dumb and asked him what flowers

Cue April. Mysterious bouquets of flowers start getting delivered weekly, that I'm the most beautiful ""woman"" he knows and that he loves me, but that he knows I'm young so he's willing ""to wait a few years."" I make up some excuse to go back in the house and get my mom. I'm crying at this point. Well my mom and step-dad go downstairs and tell him that they will shoot his ass if they don't get off our property right now. He gets pissed and says they're trying to deny us our love (what. the. fuck.). My step-dad says he's serious about getting the gun so John eventually leaves, but says that ""they can't keep him away from me.""

We go to the cops. We get a restraining order. Remember the whole small town part? Well

Then the phone calls start. He would call from prepaid phones and pay phones so the numbers were never consistent. My mom forbid me from answering the phone unless I knew who it was (before I would always answer unknown numbers if I was home alone

Then things stopped. It seemed like everything was over. I started high school and soon forgot all about creepy John. Boys my own age began to like me and everything seemed to be normal. Until the end of my senior year of high school. A letter came addressed to me, and that I had better dump my loser boyfriend because it was time for him to come back in my life; that he knew I wanted him and he would do whatever it took to make sure we were reunited. 

The cops were called again and my school was informed. I only had a month left of term and spent that last month with my teachers watching me like a hawk. My mom insisted on coming to pick me up every day (I didn't have my own car) and I wasn't allowed to leave with anyone else. We get a call from the cops a few weeks later telling us that John has been arrested for unrelated charges

I thought that would be the end of it. Since I graduated so young I didn't leave for university until the next year (17, just as scary and threatening as the first. Then at my job, which largely involved a lot of audience interaction, a lady handed me a note at the end of the run. I was confused but kept it, only to open it in the dressing room. It was addressed to me (using my full name) inviting me to ""meet up with her and her friend."" We didn't have programs that listed names and I had never seen her before. I have no clue if that was related at all to John, but given that he had just made contact AGAIN I was incredibly shaken by it.

I haven't heard from him since. I've moved again since that last letter. I don't know if he's still in jail (I certainly hope so). I just hope that

1365219448.0,1bs1jb,So let me tell you about the time I met a serial killer... (X-Post from TIL),HaploXar42,252,61,78,"[X-Post from TIL:](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1br6ue/til_there_may_be_as_many_as_3550_active_serial/c999cvb)  
  
My ex girlfriend and I once met a serial killer. We were lucky to escape with our lives. Scary to know they're out there. Even scarier to have a brush with one and know you were almost a victim.

EDIT: Looks like there's some interest in the full story so here goes:  
  
So one night my girlfriend (at the time) and I decided to take some acid and trip for the night. Anyone that's actually done acid know that you don't see things that aren't really there. It's more a shifting of perception. It's important to know that.  
  
Also important to note is that we lived in a very small beach community and there was a hurricane right off the coast. Everyone was supposed to evacuate the next day
  
We lived within walking distance of the beach
  
We played at the beach for a while
  
On the way, in an almost deserted beach town, looking at the trees across the side street we're on.  
  
I'm not paying much attention but noticed the compact car as it drives past us. I'm still looking at the trees when I hear my girlfriend say
  
I look at the car now, if you're a decent driver. The car, a red sub-compact, finally finishes turning around. It drives up in front of us and stops, engine still running.  
  
I'm wondering what's going on when the passenger window rolls down (the drivers side is opposite of us). There's a weird looking guy in the drivers seat and no one else. I notice he's missing teeth and has strange eyes. He says something but I can't really hear what it was, what was that? I couldn't hear you.""  
  
He asks something again
  
I get to the window. The weird looking guy asks
  
Hmm. Main street. Where is there a Main Street in my town? I can't think of one. I ask him if he means one of the main roads
  
He thinks for a moment
  
""No,"" he says.  
  
Still unable to think of where this might be. My town is a barrier island. I know it like the back of my hand. I've lived there for years. I mention another main road. Again I get the same response.  
  
At this point
  
BAM! It hits me like a ton of bricks. I mean
  
I look back in the car. The switch turns off. Suddenly I'm sober again. And now I'm noticing it. I look back up. Slammed with the acid feeling. Back in the car. Sober
  
Now I'm starting to finally pay attention. Why is everything sober-normal when I look at this guy
  
The whole time I was processing this
  
I look back in the car, the dashboard, the floors. Everything.  
  
""What the hell is that?"" I'm wondering. I look closer. It's black plastic. Then I see the knife. A wicked
  
Oh, that you know, something is very wrong here"".  
  
And for the first time
  
I shiver and that's when he says it.  
  
Interrupting my ex
  
The menace and death in his voice is palpable. I grab my ex and start backing away.  
  
""No thanks
  
""You sure? Go drink a few beers? Come on, in it's malevolence.  
  
I say, please. We have to go home."" I'm terrified at this point. I'm practically praying that he doesn't get out of the car, with the knife, since I'm unarmed.  
  
He gives me one last look, and says, ""Well, you be careful now.""  
  
He drives away. My first thought was
  
What was a guy, I later checked). Why did he have a huge knife? Why did he try to get us to go for a ride? What would have happened if we did?  
  
To this day
  
It should also be noted that the next day I told a friend a little about the incident. Not much
  
That night, so brought a big knife himself. He was also a teenager. It was around the same time at night when the same guy, in the same car, stopped him, still asking directions to ""Main Street"".  
  
My friend, and to fuck off.  
  
My friend said he got the same scary ass vibe from the dude. Same dead
  
The guy tried to play it off, because who knows what would have happened if I hadn't? People are too trusting in a small town like that.  
  
What's this crazy fucker doing in an evacuated or near evacuated town, while his car is covered in plastic and he has a giant knife? Being a serial killer, that's what.

A decade ago, hard drugs sold, and people hurt. So naturally, as an eight-year old boy, I had to go with them frequently to the office, including on weekends because they often have to assist customers.

Next to the warehouse, chubbier, glasses, white hair. He looked like he was big into cars and automechanics. He also was a very avid drinker, and had recently lost his wife a few months prior.

My Dad was driving a truck

We were heading down the alley that separated Norman's house from the warehouse. As we turned the corner, with a toothpick hanging loosely between his lips. He gave an apathetic wave to my Dad, who pulled over next to the curb, and the two began talking. 

As a parent, and saying, ""Is that so?"" He then reaches back behind my Dad's seat and wraps his calloused and thick hand around my throat, while maintaining his sick laugh. He squeezes sharply.

All the while, is just staring. I figured he thought that the grip wasn't very strong, and it looked like a simple caress, but the squeeze tightened. I felt a warm, sharp feeling ascend in my throat. I couldn't breathe. My Dad must've figured he was rustling my hair like with a 'proud' intention. His hand around my throat must have lasted  around 10 seconds before tears started exploding out of my eyes and I began frantically smacking his hand off. I was wailing and put my head in my hands. 

My Dad: Oh

Norman said,"" with a sarcastic chuckle. They said their farewells, and my Dad began driving off. I lift my head and look out the back window. Norman is staring at me with a look of extreme anger. His teeth are gritting and his eyes are flaring. He then lifts his hand to a simple little wave, and smiles. I break down again and start sobbing.

I told my Dad later about how he was choking me

1337580880.0,tx5nv,Picked out of traffic by a lunatic off his meds,SamuelLBronkowicz,217,28,20,"I was visiting family in Erie, so I had lunch at a locally famous hot dog shop and then went for a leisurely drive around Presque Isle State Park.  I had the cruise control set at just under 30 mph and the radio tuned to the local classic rock station...basically just lost in my head having a completely happy and mellow drive.

A little past the midway point, gunning his engine and spinning up all kinds of dust.  No big deal, I thought...just some redneck showing off.  It happens all the time.  He did a big loop and then made a straight line back towards the road, right into my path.  I had my foot over the break ready to stop, but he slammed on his brakes in time and stopped a few feet from my car.  It was a dick move, but it happened so fast and I'd been in a really good mood, so I didn't even think to flip him off.

He pulled back onto the road and immediately started tailgating me.  At first I figured he was pissed I didn't hit the brakes and let him cut me off and wanted to show it...and then he rammed the back of my car, a solid decision).

I grabbed my cellphone and dialed 911.  While I was talking to the dispatcher, calling out landmarks to the dispatcher so the park cops would know where we were while he repeatedly rammed me (10 - 15 times in total).  Traffic coming the other direction was steady (it was Labor Day Weekend), so I didn't have an option to try to flee.

At one point, and then got right back on the road without ever calling anyone (fuck that guy).  At another point, I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed something weird:  I figured the guy was pissed at me and expected him to be road raging and animated...like hands waving or pounding on the steering wheel or something.  He was calm as could be, like he was driving to Grandma's house or something, but I saw that two fingers of his right had were pointed sideways at an odd angle.  He came at me again and I put it out of my head and worried about driving.

When the traffic coming the opposite way finally cleared enough, had a serious case of the shakes, and then went inside to give my statement.  I heard a bit of the rest of it on the radio.

He raced past the first two cops who tried to stop him and crashed into the third and was taken into custody.  I steadied my hands as much as I could and wrote my statement, ""It could have been worse"" and reached behind his back and pulled a huge revolver from his waistband.  They found it on the seat when they hauled him out of his truck.  About an hour later I realized that's what I had seen when I thought I saw his fingers pointed at an odd angle...he had the gun in his hand against the steering wheel the whole time!  The officer called him ""mental"", and said he told them he was on a mission from god to kill all the ""baby-fuckers"" (we took that to mean pedophiles).

He was committed and wouldn't be charged unless he left whatever program he was put into.  I never heard anything further, so I'm guessing he did what he was supposed to.  Two or three times in the past few years I've tried a couple of internet searches on his name out of curiosity but came up empty.

He had apparently been walking around in the forest on the left side of the footpath (the kindergarten is on the right), he asked us to help him with something...

He wanted us to pluck the thorns off of his body, and there it was; his genitals on display (though not nakedly, with his inside pocket covering it). He was holding out a banknote, trying to lure us in...

1369954216.0,1fd970,Creeped Right of the Town We Lived In,UCMCoyote,223,34,40,"So this happened to me when I was a senior in high school.  I'm a California native and my parents loved to move.  Mom was always searching for bigger and better houses and Dad supported her.  So when I was a teenager we moved from the Bay Area to the Central Valley.

Now for those of you who don't know anything about California geography, its not the image a lot of people have when they imagine the California life.

Anyway

Anyway, embrace them but the neighbors begin to act strange, talking about how its okay to cheat on your spouse, give your young kid alcohol, do drugs, etc.  It creeped my parents out and as such they started to pull away.

As time went on our neighbors tried to keep things friendly but kept acting weird.  They kept saying things like ""Saw ya mowing.  Your grass holding up?"" when there was clearly no one outside.  They would comment about me raising my new puppy or the fact I was inside the house and working on homework assignments at the table ""Saw  your boy at the dining room table.  He in trouble?""  It was all kind of strange but we played it off.  

Then one day I'm home alone sick and I come downstairs and walk to the front door for a moment.  Our neighbor has his front windows blinds up and I see....a telescope of some kind.  It's pointed right at our front window!

I spy through the window as he's washing his window and then watch as he lowers the blinds.  he adjusts the slats so there seems to be just enough room to peer through.  In the time we'd known him we never saw the blinds up.  Creepy. 

I tell my parents who brush it off.  This is a tiny town

Again I tell my parents but they tell me to just ignore it and don't talk to the neighbor.  For awhile nothing really happens,"" etc.  We ignore it as best we can.  

Then one night, and my sisters room, faces the street and we could hear people and music and we ignore it...until 3 AM.  

By now I'm trying to sleep, annoyed, and can't sleep.  I decide that....I'd had enough.  Without waking my parents up I called the police.  I reported a noise disturbance and asked if someone could come by.  I was a stupid kid and maybe I didn't do the right thing but I had enough and my parents weren't doing anything.  

The police come and talk

By now the noise is loud enough my parents get up and the neighbor is shouting at my sister (who he can see in her now open window) to take her top off (she was 12). 

My mom grabs the camcorder and records and It takes everything I have to stop my Dad from running outside to knock this guy's lights out.  

Things get weird from here on out.  We file for a restraining order and then we start seeing our neighbor everywhere.  He's at my Dad's work

Some days he would just be standing at his window, and it really creeped my parents out.  He always leered at my sister and she claimed he pointed the gun at her window when she was peeking out.

 What I do know is that he followed me home from a bus stop in his car at 9 pm ever so slowly, and two being the he was preparing to ever so creepily demand I get in his car so he can park around the corner to sexually assault a minor. Well it was definitely the latter.

I told him very politely to leave me alone. Over and over. So when he didn't

1374650348.0,1ixymv,The creepiest guy I have ever met.,DanniGat,225,34,52,"Reading through these for the past few weeks has made me decide to share some of my experiences with creepy people. Now let's start with the fact that I'm a big guy, yes that hurts as much as you think it does, its generally not something to laugh about.

The person that will forever haunt my slumbering moments I met when I was just out of high school. I didn't have a car and the concept of 'public transportation' is about as foreign here as the concept of letting strangers off the street into your house and offering them food is most other places in the country. So I walked anywhere and every where that was within 15 miles. I was working at a fast food restaurant that was about a 45 minute walk from my house, and I could just walk and think and listen to the sounds of the night. That all changed after I met this person. I was walking home like normal, uniform shirt thrown over my shoulder, enjoying the feel of the breeze. I saw someone cross the street about 300 yds (~100m) in front of me, but all I could see was the silhouette against the front porch light of a house down the road, we have a grand total of about 6 street lights on the back roads in the county, so its usually very dark and very hard to see at distances. 

Something about him just seemed off, its dark and my mind is just trying to scare me so I cautiously took a step forward, reaching into my pocket and gripping my pocket knife. As I get closer to him I can sort of see his slightly darker shape against the black pine trees behind him. I know I can see a knife at this point, and my mind clicks, that he isn't walking like a normal person. It's almost like he's walking crouched down. I'm not sure what to do, he's between me and home. The back roads don't connect to each other and I know the homeless people live in the woods around here, some of them are ok

My brain is screaming at me to do something, I can't make it out but I can hear him making some noise. I can also see he is swinging something around in his other hand, but again, it's dark, its hard to see. I back off the road a little and put the drainage ditch between us, but never take my eyes off the guy.

He gets closer and I see that he does indeed have a rather large knife, I'm just hoping that a car will drive by, I'd even have taken a sheriff's deputy at that point. He gets across the street from me and stops. I can hear him really well now, it almost sounded like he was chanting, or reciting a verse over and over again. He turned his full body to face me and just roared at me at the top of his lungs. I booked it towards home. 

Looking over my shoulder every turn, swinging his knife and dead cat at me every step of the way. I'm not about to lead him to my house though, my mom and sister are home alone, my dad being out of town for work. I run as fast as I can passing the road I live on, and as long as I can but I can feel the burn and the pain, and the wobble that forecasts my knee giving out. I turn look over my shoulder and he's still there, a little further away, but about fifty feet from his fence I feel the pop, I remember why I was running and look behind me. He was no where to be seen.

I started crawling towards his fence, his father always commented on how stoic I am. I explain what happened to them, and they both look at me like I'm speaking in tongues. I go through it all twice for them before my friend agrees to drive me home. I was watching the entire way, I never saw him. I figured he had ran into the woods or something. We got home and he waited till I was inside and locked the door before he left. 

I changed clothes, but they didn't show up for at least half an hour by which time he was long gone. I couldn't sleep for a month, I stopped walking home from work, and I started carrying more than just a pocket knife if I had to walk alone outside after dark. I still have trouble sleeping at night. I haven't ever seen him again. But I swear sometimes I can feel him watching when I'm outside at night.

**INTRODUCTION**
So I used to work at a McDonald's in one of Berlin's worst areas (For those who want to know - it's called Hermannplatz) which is known to have a severe problem with drugs - I had to regularly wipe blood off the toilets and bathroom sinks (also: syringes every other day)

This one night (November 1st 2010) i had a shift from 2pm to 10pm and

So at 12am I finally decided to leave when I noticed that my public transit ticket had run out and I didn't have any money or credit cards with me for obvious reasons. A co-worker offered to give me some money for a ticket just so I'd get home safely. I just shrugged it off and set out to what seemed like an odyssey.

**THE ACTUAL STORY**

I left the district without any weird incidents, that no way in hell I’d give him my phone, luckily he stayed rather peaceful as well.

When the headlights of a car turned up like 100m away I did what I thought was the cleverest decision at that point – I ran onto the street and hoped it would stop for me. It didn’t

That’s when I knew that shit had hit the fan and I just started running mindlessly while occasionally turning my head to see whether the guy was trailing me – he was and he also was closing in on me. So I just stopped and shouted at him that he’s free to take my phone

What followed now was some of the weirdest shit I ever experienced. He took my phone saying that I will have to stay with him because he needs someone to talk to. So we started walking the street up and down. He talked about how both of his parents died

He was pretty gentle with me, never letting me speak apart from when he asked me how old I was (I lied to invoke some pity in him) and what my name was (lied as well, you wouldn’t want a person that might be dangerous in a very creepy way to know your real name). For a moment, when he wanted to see my wallet and found my ID I thought it’d get pretty ugly. But after shouting at me for about 5 minutes who I thought I was to lie at him, he calmed himself down again.

At this point we had been walking the freaking street up and down for about 2 ½ hours, but also by saying that he was the member of some gang that apparently is not unknown to Berlin police.

When, he took out the sim-card &amp; gave it to me, saying that if we ever were to meet again, he’d give me some of the money he earned with the phone (which had a cracked display btw).

End of the story was that he left

**TL;DR – Due to a chain of unfortunate circumstances I was basically held hostage for about 3h just so the guy could take my phone and talk to me about his fucked up tell-tale life.**

We went into the housing situation late as shit. Usually, one of us had contacted a landlord to set up a look-and-see. We met him outside the property at the designated time. He had a pony tail and was past the point of thinking it might be cool. Dude was at least 60, and awkward. But landlords, since the middle ages, have always been somewhat slimy. We began to look at the house.

The house was gorg. Not far from campus, living room, and basement areas. There were some of the current residents in the home while we looked around. They said utilities were alright, neighbors were chill, all around decent. The landlord said simple greetings to each girl, and we moved upstairs to see the bedrooms. 

All of us went in sort of separate directions. There were three bedrooms, and behold, found what appeared to be the door to the attic. Just as we turned around, this landlord was standing there. K asked, ""is this the door to the attic?"" To which this bespectacled, pony-tailed ghoul said in a sinister fashion, ""That isn't part of the deal."" (Yes

One girl, strangely, and called for J to come with him to look at the parking situation. 
Our troop is almost fully outside, and I immediately felt like the atmosphere had been altered. J seemed unnerved and anxious as this landlord man was talking about all the parking possibilities. We thanked the man for his time, each of us introspectively thinking ""Why would he still have a pony tail, it's 2012"", and made our way down the alley toward the house I'm currently in.
J was walking very quickly and looking back several times. Once we had walked for maybe 3 minutes

(From what I best remember of her paraphrase):
""Don't live here. Please don't let your friends say they'll move in or even keep talking to this guy. He lives in the attic. He won't tell you. He didn't tell us. I can't even believe he left you alone in here with me (probably thrown off that 5 people were there instead of the regular 4)

Reeling, and angry. Like, what the fuck dude? I don't know what the girls living there were doing about it, but it didn't seem like much. We were significantly creeped out and didn't respond to any calls from him, except his first, saying we weren't interested, yo.

 After the cops and majority of the guests finally left I told everyone to keep the party inside because I didn't want it to loud outside. I decided I needed some fresh air and some time to myself after the events of night. I went out into my backyard and sat on a patio chair. Leaning my head against the wooden fence behind me I began to doze off. 

My friends Kristyna and Rami thought it would be a good idea to sneak up on me and scare the crap out of me. I let out a huge scream. I'm still not sure how long I had been sleeping for. It couldn't of been that long. About 20 seconds after my scream we heard aanother scream come from somewhere else. It was almost like a delayed echo. It was the scream of a female for sure

We started walking towards the part of my backyard that had a chain link fence so that we could see the road and down my street. It was very dark probably around 1:30am and the street was very dimly lit with street lights. I was just about to say it must have just been someone walking by and they wanted to be funny or something, had long dark hair, and her skin was so pale it almost seemed to glow in the dark. 

I suggested that it looked a lot like our friend Laura, to see if I would get the same response, and I did. She screamed back almost immediately.

 I then called out ""Laura?"" and she responded with ""Yes!"" Rami and I decided we needed to approach her and try and get her back into the house safely before the cops came back and we all got into serious shit. We got about half way to this girl and she still stood there like a stone. She did not move, this can't be Laura, because if it was she wouldn't just be standing there like she was. We still couldn't make out the face. 

Next thing I know I hear Kristyna calling out for us. ""Laura is inside passed out!"" Those words hit me like a ton of bricks and I froze. All of a sudden this mystery girl begins cackling so loud that Rami and I both jumped. I mean, scary laughing. When she was finally out of site, I could still hear this laughing like she was still 10 feet away from us. We turned around and started power walking back to the house, when we were startled with loud banging that sounded almost like metal garbage cans smashing together. This girl really creeped me out so I went inside, locked all the windows and doors, and hid under my covers. 

To this day I have no idea who she was. What young girl in their right mind would just stand there by herself when 2 strangers are approaching her. One of the strangers being 6'2 and 210lbs. She was either really brave and just wanted to have some fun with us, is that the next day I saw the man who lives at the house where the girl was standing and I asked him if he heard or saw anything out of the ordinary between 1 and 2am. He said he heard nothing. It seems almost impossible that she was so close to his house and was so loud and he didn't hear.

My first experience was when I was 11 years old.  My parents worked together in their own business

One day I ended up getting sick, mom couldn't just not go to the office, she had to answer phones and such, seeing as she was the only one there.  She figured I was big enough to be on my own for a few hours, just from about 8-12.  That would be enough time to get some work done, and handle any important business.

Now, stick straight, fearful of everyone that walked by, sure that mom had been attacked and would never come back to the car.  Of course, that never happened, but when you are a kid, rational thinking is not your strong point.

So, and to ""NOT ANSWER THE DOOR FOR ANYONE.""

So, snuggled in a blanket.

Maybe an hour later

Just breathe, and will leave soon. A few minutes pass, long enough that the average person would figure, *hey, no ones home, guess I'll be on my way.*

The doorbell rings again.  This time I get up, I am only wearing a tank top and panties, so I am not about to rush over to the door.

In order to see the door, and press myself against the wall, praying he did not see me, still hoping he will leave. Up till now, there is pretty much no rational reason I am freaking out, it's just someone at the door, not Jason or Freddy.

Up till now.  He sees me and begins knocking on the door and ringing the bell in earnest.  By now 5 minutes have passed.

""Open the door, open the door.""

I don't move.

""Open the door

I look to the door

BANG BANG BANG. I wince at each fist fall.

Now as a child, thinking perhaps I will get in trouble if I don't open the door. *Maybe he will tell my mom I was bad.*

I walk to the door with my hand outstretched, sometimes in a sweet singsong manner.

At the last possible second

""OPEN THE DOOR. NOW!"" he yells.  ""OPEN THE F-CKING DOOR

I run back to the living room and do a little freakout dance as i try to figure out what to do.  He continues to pound mercilessly at the door

I hesitate calling my mom, and can't really help me anyways.  I remember that our neighbor two houses down is retired and she is usually home.  She doesn't really like kids, but at this point I feel like she is my only hope.  She has hawk eyes, and a pension for being in everyones business, so I am sure that she has probably already seen the truck parked out front.

In my panicked state

*877-9878!* I grab the telephone and scramble to dial the number.

After 3 agonizing rings she answers.

""Hello

I hang up and within a minute

Maureen comes rushing into our yard, and telling him to get the hell out of here. At this point I open the door.

It is amazing, waiting for you to make the one mistake that will give them access to you.  I have read many stories on here today, and the common thread I see is, *""He seemed so nice at first""*, or *""he was really charming"", ""I thought he was just overly friendly.""* They know how to talk to you to get what they want.  

Think of it like a hunter.  Hunters disguise themselves to blend in with the prey's natural surroundings, or use bait to attract their kill.  Remember, YOU are the prey.  Learn to listen to your instincts, and never be afraid to ""hurt someones feelings"" in order to stay safe.  Don't become an ""If only.""  *If only I had asked someone to walk me to my car.

My mother had recently lost her key to the front door, a nice neighborhood, and crime was never a discussion.

But that night changed everything. I remember going into the kitchen, when I hear a scratching sound at the door. The wind was blowing that night, making all sorts of sounds outside, so I didn't really pay it any attention. For some reason, though, I decided to eat my cereal over the sink--in the kitchen--only a few feet away from the front door. This was something I never did.

My cats, thinking they are no fun to play with. The scratching sound continues, then my stomach just drops. I can't even explain the feeling to you guys. It was like my intestines just fell down lower into my stomach. I realized that it wasn't the wind making that sound.

I walk to the door and decide to peek through the blinds

I peek through the blinds, the striking outline of his nose, the coy grin on his lips. But the eyes. I will never forget those fucking eyes. 

I dropped my bowl (which shattered on the floor) and quickly turned the deadbolt, and was able to shut and lock the deadbolt.

I locked myself in a closet, didn't find anything, they left. I had a panic attack and my mom called my stepdad. He drove around and said he saw a guy walking the streets, but that was it. No one knows who it was.

The most terrifying thing is that I usually listened to my iPod on max volume, and I would have never known he was inside. My bedroom was also at the back of the house, far away from the front door. I usually can't even hear the doorbell when it rings, so I would have been fucked if I hadn't decided to take my cereal over the sink that night. The thought makes me sick to this day.

1345299864.0,yffma,The man at the window,Yuzen,226,38,63,"Hello there! This will be my second story that I've posted on this subreddit

It was a fairly typical night for me. I'd been chilling out in my computer room (Context: I have a bedroom upstairs in the house and a room to myself downstairs that contains my computer) just playing about, the usual home alone kid stuff. I think I was playing World of Warcraft back then. Hey, it was two years ago, give me a break. Now, I'm pretty bad when it comes to sleeping whenever I have nothing to get up for. My sleeping cycle goes completely out of whack and I wind up waking up at strange times and staying up til the early hours of the morning. In this case it must have been going well on 4am when this incident occurred.

I think I was grinding at the time. I usually listened to music back then when I was grinding, sometimes there's other reasons for them crying out, but I've certainly heard things like that in the past. What alarmed me about this particular sound, though, was that it was coming directly from my back garden. I was worried that two cats were going at it and were trying to fight to the death in my back yard.

Being a big animal lover (We used to own cats when we lived out in the country, had provoked it to cry out in such a manner, as if it were hurt or scared? It was at that point that I heard the sounds of stones rattling together. Our back garden has quite a bit of gravel in it, it's a decorative sort of thing, a bit hard to describe without a picture, but you probably get the idea.

I instinctively cast my eyes in the direction that I thought the rustling had come from. Now, very dark 4am outside. There's no real lighting near my back garden, especially not near the fence where I'd heard the sound. My eyes hadn't quite adjusted to the night, but there's no mistaking what I saw: a very human shaped shadow looming up from behind a small bush that we had growing near the fence. I had a bit of a NOPE moment and rather swiftly slammed the door shut and locked it. 

But it was 4am. I've always had a bit of an active imagination where horror is concerned. I'm the guy who sits around and reads creepypasta home alone with the lights turned out and then has rather vivid (and terrifying) dreams. I figured it was probably my imagination. It wouldn't be the first time I'd thought I'd seen something and it turned out to be nothing. At the time, so I shrugged and figured it had just been a trick of the light. Back to grinding on WoW.

About twenty minutes passed before I slid back from my desk and stood up to go and fetch a drink. Just as I was heading to the door to head out towards the kitchen, something that my brain instantly recognises as not belonging. I paused and turned to see something that, to this day, keeps my curtains the fuck closed whenever I'm in my room at night.

There's a face pressing against the window. It's not a human face, and [here we go](http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/robot%20mask%20lg.jpg)

So, holding my empty glass that I had been planning on filling with OJ, when I'm looking eye to eye with someone pushing their masked face up against my window, standing in my dark assed garden, at 4:20am. My heart skipped a beat. The first thing I did was break eye contact (Or what I imagined was eye contact. I couldn't really see their eyes from a distance because of the lack of light near the window) and head on through the door and into the kitchen. I placed the glass down on the table. As I did this I heard rustling. Something moving on the gravel again. This time it was loud, pronounced, heavy footsteps upon the stone. I turn to the kitchen window, but I can't make it out. I notice they have gloves on

I'm caught between two minds. They're around the back and it'd take them a few seconds to get around to the front of the house if I choose to bolt from the kitchen and sprint out into the cul-de-sac and reach a neighbours place. That'd be fast, short as it might be. What if they were just plain faster than me? What if they went inside the house after I left and stole something then vanished before the cops could show up? It wasn't like I'd have time to open the door, lock it again, then bolt! 

My other option was to phone the police then hope the nutjob doesn't start trying to smash in the window and climb through it. The window in the kitchen would have been a tough sell, what was to stop them? Grabbing the phone, I decided I'd take my chances. I had been standing in the hallway at this point having backed the fuck away from the kitchen. I'd heard more banging on the window there and didn't want anything to do with it. At least in the hallway I couldn't see him, and he couldn't see me. I knew I could have phoned the cops then and there, but I went back into my room. Surprise surprise, there he was. I made a very obvious show of raising the phone and dialling the number, practically shouting down the phone, I'm sure that is standard policy for them.

Even though this guy knows the cops are coming (I told him, and that's when I saw it: a stupid pellet gun that I'd had since I was a kid. I say stupid because the damn thing was broken and didn't even work anymore. But it looked real. Very, very real. It was a M1911 replica, I believe, and completely looked the part. It was totally hidden from the masked man's view, since it was tucked off behind my computer collecting dust.

When I suddenly grabbed it and stormed towards the window, he backs off, he jumps even, and then just like that, he's gone. I was terrified, scared nearly out of my mind, but the adrenaline took hold, if the guy had been smart

The police arrived 10 minutes later (It's a good job I went for the gun ploy..) and checked the house, and the entire estate for any sign of the man at the window, but he was gone. They said he was in all likelihood some drunk teenager who'd found a leftover mask from Halloween and decided to have a laugh. I believed them at the time, it helped me feel better... but I remember that shot of the persons hairline, and I remember their build.. they were an older person. 30s or 40s. Drunk or on drugs, quite possibly, but who knows what they really wanted. I never saw a weapon on them, but I can tell you this: I've never felt truly comfortable in that room when I'm in the house alone ever since,False,

So, and he grabbed my arm and started poking at my tattoos, rambling about all the ink he had gotten in prison. I gently pried my arm away and nodded agreement until I backed into my apartment and locked the door.

After that, lonely, and like his life was kind of shit. Finally, after one night of non stop screaming between him and his girlfriend, his very pregnant lady moved out and left him all alone. 

Hours after this incident he knocked on my door. I opened it a little bit and he tried to push his way in. He reeked of booze. He was holding a styrofoam take out container.

**""I'm sorry... I'm a vegetarian.""** I replied

I awkwardly thanked him for thinking of me and told him to go drink some water. I shut the door in his face.

I didn't hear from him for a couple of days, I heard a phantom voice: **""I love you.""**

I paused, staring at me. **""Girl, I fucking love you. Let me in and let me show you how much I love you.""**

I very firmly told him to leave me alone. He argued a bit and then consented.

1364006593.0,1au7ji,woke up to find some guy I didn't know asleep on the floor next to me,chesterfeildsofa,217,33,34,"Based on the title
I am a female, and I had a ferret that I let run around freely instead of putting in a cage. To keep him in the living room, I put a board up about waist high in the doorway leading to the kitchen so he couldn't escape. My mom also had 2 dogs that were pretty big. They looked intimidating but were big babies. Even being a huge dog, one of them didn't realize he had the power to jump over the board, so whenever someone came in the house from the front door he would just stay at the boarded off doorway and bark. 

I had been in Kentucky visiting family the week before and had just gotten home. I have a bad habit of staying up pretty late. I didn't lay down until around 3am and by that time I was exhausted and fell asleep pretty quickly.

I also forgot to lock the door.

I vaguely remember my step dad yelling at me, but not me on the couch. This was because it being so hot, I would only sleep in my underwear and didn't want someone to see me if I kicked the blanket off in my sleep.

So anyway, scared, trying to think of a rational excuse for this guy I didn't know being asleep next to me on the floor. After a few minutes I came to the conclusion he must have been one of my parents friends who had drank too much and stayed the night. They had friends that would do that every once in a while, but usually they would stay in another room. 

It took me about 10 minutes to work up the courage to get off the couch. Still in my underwear
""Mom...who is that guy?""
she looked at me with a confused look and said ""what guy?""
""the guy asleep in the living room""
her eyes got wide and she said ""you don't know him?""
I said ""uh...no""
She jumped up and ran into the bedroom where my step dad was and shouted ""SAMANTHA DOES NOT KNOW THAT GUY!!!""
He jumped up, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!?""

My mom called the police while my step dad made sure the guy didn't try to leave. Before the cops got there, but then the guy said he was going to piss himself. The guy didn't really have to go to the bathroom as it turned out, he had meth on him and tried to flush it down the toilet.

So here's what happened while I was asleep. Around 5am, i don't know). He left the doors to all the cars wide open so it was pretty obvious someone had went through them. The police showed up and arrested him. We gave our statements and that was the end. And yes, now I make sure the door is locked before I go to bed.

This was the first time I invited someone over, as many of my friends lived south of me and didn't know (and still don't) know where I live or how to get there. Since it was the first time, and it went well, I invited him over again. But I shouldn't have. 
It was January 12th, since he didn't have a Playstation 2. Eventually, he got bored and wanted to do something else. He wanted to play hide and seek in the big basement. However, the strange terms were (if he finds me in 20 or so seconds) either to give him GTA SA cheats, or to give him a blowjob. 
I thought it was joke. Surely, in case you haven't noticed) Thinking he was joking, I agreed. In did find me within 20 seconds. Shit. He wanted me. I pleaded with him not to want me. I gave him the cheat code book and we got back to playing San Andreas. Hopefully, I thought, this would be the last time I would have to deal with this. But it wasn't.
Later in the night, and I was on my laptop. I had to leave the room to get something. When I came back, there he is, masturbating. Full out. Disgusting. I tell him to put it way. He doesn't, and I pull the computer plug from the socket. I ask him why, and he doesn't give me a response. About thirty minutes later, he goes to my bathroom. 
He comes out, ""Please suck it."" 
I was revolted. I told him no the first time.

Context: I'm a girl. At the time I was 18, so I had to catch a 7am bus transfer to get there on time.

So there I am waiting at the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station waiting for the bus I'm transferring onto to arrive. I'm just sitting on this concrete bench with my headphones on by myself on a cold winter morning. This guy walks by and starts pacing in front of my smoking a cigarette, but he's a smoker and it's public transit.

Then this guy starts talking to me. Now, scaring the living shit out of me. So I pause my music and take out a headphone to see what he wants, and oh man does shit get weird.

(Now, I tell him its something generic like Debbie. He starts talking about how he just got out of jail after being in for 3 months (he didn't say why) and told me that he saw my face in a Maxim magazine while he was in. Well fuck. All aboard the crazy train, because obviously there's no way in hell. He starts rambling about girls secretly wanting to be with bad guys and said that secretly deep down I wanted to be with him. ugh.

So a guy comes along who sees me clearly creeped the fuck out by this homeless looking guy, I have a class to get to"".

About three years ago, though, we needed someone to stay at the house and watch over everything, so my girlfriend and I moved in.

While this was going on, though, and that made me laugh at the time.  Boyfriend of the year, ladies.

We did quickly discover that, sneak in through the window to use the built-in microwave, turn on the AC, or use the toilets.  For the most part, when we told them people owned this property, they agreed to stop coming.  Except one old man.

The first time we met him, who we'll call Dan, explained that he lived at the house and needed us all to get out.  I explained that he didn't and that I understood that homeless people came here while it was abandoned, we weren't going to allow that anymore.  

""No, you have to get out now.""  I told him he had to leave, he responded by defecating in his pants.  Time to call the police, I thought.

The cops knew him by name

Two weeks later, which one of the construction workers must have left lying around.  He starts to come up to the car, I see the wrench, and I gun the ignition and go back up the circular parking lot with him chasing behind us.

God help me

When we returned with the police, as I would rather the door be smashed than my head.  The police said they would send a patrol car up every so often since the house was so close to the station, but there's not much else they can do besides check his usual haunts.  Fair enough, I guess, and the officers leave.

We go inside

The bedroom is set up so that there's a sitting area apart from the main bedroom area and it's separated by french doors made of glass.  So we didn't notice when the door to the sitting area from the hallway slowly opened.  We especially did not notice the person holding a small garden spade.  If not for me needing to hit the light to get something from inside the nightstand

We both slipped on clothes and ran outside outside the bedroom door to see someone basically rip the lock out of the front door and kick it open to get outside.  They took off like an animal

We called the police (who at this point seemed slightly tired of coming to this house) and checked around with an aluminum baseball bat in hand.  Our guess was that he simply ripped out one of the weaker door frames in a room with ongoing construction

Soon, while I tended a bit more towards punk. Both of us loved My Chemical Romance. I figured he was just into me because there weren't many other girls with similar interests.

Before long, but started avoiding him. I would go to the local grocery store to eat lunch, even though it was more expensive, because underclassmen weren't allowed to leave campus.

The situation continued to escalate to the point where he was sexually harassing me every chance I failed to avoid him. If he was waiting for me at my locker he would say sexually explicit things to me, he left his girlfriend waiting awkwardly while he came to tell me that he really wanted us all to have a threesome. Luckily my girlfriends were with me and came over as soon as they noticed him talking to me, which made him scurry away.

As quickly as it started, my friend mentioned him in front of my dad (who was also the principal of my high school). My dad questioned me about what happened and I ended up telling him the whole story. He seemed really troubled. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me why Brian had been absent from school recently.

It didn't help much that my bedroom was on the first floor and had a large window that was accessible to nearly anyone who could walk to the side of my house.

And of course there's always a damn tree at the window that would make scratching sounds and generally freak me out. I eventually got used to it until I watched the movie Signs. I was terrified of the scene where the little boy and his dad go upstairs and look out the window

I was so paranoid of something like that happening. 

And one day, I'd stay up late on school nights watching Adult Swim. Just after cutting to commercial break, I hear a tapping at the window. I was immediately terrified. It didn't sound like the normal sound of a tree branch against the glass, so I turned the TV volume down to see if I could hear it again.

The tapping sound again. Oh god. What to do. Tapping again

So I did pretty much the stupidest thing imaginable. Looking back on it now

WTF..... Dad?!? Yeah. My dad was standing there outside my window. Now with an angry look on his face. He makes an ""open the window"" motion with his arms. I crack open the window so I can hear him talk.

""Why did you open the curtain???"" He scolds. 

Me: ""Uh....""

Him: ""If someone knocks on your window

Me: ""Uh... okay. Sorry.""

Him: ""DO NOT do that again! I mean it!!"" 

Then he left, and I consider it a lesson well learned.

1347493367.0,zskti,"""She gave me a key.""",inblackheels,224,39,91,"This all began about a two -- nearly three years ago. I am a 23 year old female


I was living with a friend of mine, I started playing an online game. I always loved games, normally playstation games... but the social experience to MMOs was something new, and before long I started making friends and adding them to my facebook page. Talking to people online was nice; it was somewhat unbinding from the constraints of social pretense, and I felt like I could just speak my mind and be honest and open with people; in turn they were the same toward me. I liked it.


I've always been really trusting or maybe just borderline naive. I found myself becoming ever-increasingly addicted to the lifestyle. My closest guild-mates would always comment how ""it was so weird to have a hot gamer girl on the internet"" and how ""down to earth"" I was stuff like that


We were a relatively small and close-knit guild of about 30 people. I had become a mini-officer so I helped run events in the game and recruit people. I had a ""clique"" of about 4 people I played with consistently without fail when I had the time. I found myself spending the longest duration with Eric, but somehow he'd always manage to be around whenever my hours were available. 


On Facebook


On youtube, I literally had picked the state out of a hat and found the cheapest location I could; I wanted a fresh start. Everyone wished me luck and I packed up my things and road tripped to my new and far away location.


After being there for about almost two weeks; unpacking my belongings and getting settled in, and I was super drained. I got maybe three hours of sleep and had another interview in the early morning.


It was about 5:00AM when I heard an odd scratching sound emanating from the living room of my house, and that's when I heard it. I'll never forget the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I realized that sound was coming from a human being... There was a man outside of my apartment, and he began barking at my dog. 


I immediately grabbed my cell phone and called 911. They placed me on HOLD, by the look of it he had unscrewed and fiddled with the lock somehow and if I hadn't of had a bar in the damn thing he would of gotten in. He had a few of his fingers inside of my house, and I ran over and slammed the door onto his hand as hard as I could. He laughed at me; I couldn't see his face; he had on a black turtleneck that was pulled over his mouth, but I saw light strawberry blonde hair that was buzzed sticking out and his eyes - one blue and one brown. That's when it clicked in my head.


Eric had heterochromia; a trait I thought was unique


I didn't have a gun or anything, and to come immediately. They asked me to stay on the line, but I remember being distraught and setting the phone down. I looked through the parking lot outside and saw Eric sitting in a rental car, casually in the parking lot.


It took about 10 minutes for the police to get there. When they arrived


Officer: This young woman says you tried to break into her apartment.

Eric: She's my girlfriend

Officer: How exactly do you know her?

Eric: I had planned to come see her for over three weeks, I thought she was hurt.


I got so mad that I drowned out the rest of the conversation; but when the Officer from the hall came in he actually had bought the creeps story! I blatantly pointed at the sliding door and shown where he had tampered with it


The cops ended up ordering him to stay away from me, awful, scared... I didn't go back to sleep and I ended up missing my interview. The next day later on I was getting the mail and ended up telling what happened to a neighbor of mine who happened to be an ex-marine, that made me feel a little safer. Needless to say, I never went back with my guild and I deleted everyone from it off of my facebook.


I wish I could say it ended there... but it didn't. 


Fast forward 3 months. I am getting ready to leave for work and backing out when someone comes and stands behind my car. It was Eric. I didn't know what to do, but he was shorter than me and I was NOT going to be bullied. I got out of the car and screamed ""GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!"" 


I ran inside the apartment building and he was right behind me, this time they came fast.


When they got there


A few months after that


I WISH this was the end of it, before returning to his car.


I had to call the cops and report it again. I filled out a restraining order. I have no idea where he is now or what he's doing but I don't think that he's done with me, but based on how obsessed he's been I think it's far from it.

As we aged Brandon and my brother fell into drug use as most typical hooligan kids do (nothing tooo special to note, the norm) and of course the abuse towards Brandon had gotten worse and he often talked of how much he hated his parents/grandmother as they were always calling the police on him for being high/drunk and generally being a hooligan as a kid.

1338319398.0,uarui,Good Thing I Don't Like Sausage with My Pizza,lazyslug,227,41,28,"I attend a college that is located in one of the poorest cities in Northern California. The campus is relatively safe since the school employs its own department of public safety

About 2 years ago, the student grocery store and cafeteria were closed for day and I had nothing in the apartment to eat and no car to get food elsewhere. I was woefully poking around the fridge in the hopes that I would find something substantial to tide me over until morning when I noticed a Domino's coupon that someone had stuck to the freezer. My stomach's pathetic cries for sustenance had been answered! I quickly decided that there was no shame in ordering a whole pizza (+ cinna stix) for myself because 1) I was ravenous, 2) the completion of finals demanded some sort of celebration, and 3) if anyone happened to ask I was going to lie and say I was sharing with a friend or something along those lines. Anyway, I eagerly order up my feast for 1 and provide the cashier with my address, apartment, and cell number. I typically never give out my number to anyone, and I knew that they needed my number to call me once they were outside because the drivers always got lost navigating through campus.

About 20 minutes later, my sense of caution kicked in and I slowed my pace as my brain took in the fact that there were no other students out, the lighting was bad, and I was essentially walking up to a stranger and his car that still had its engine running. As I neared the bottom of the steps, I silently hoped that he would cross the street and approach me so that I wouldn't have to get near the car. Of course, that didn't happen.

I made my way across the street and was finally able to get a good look at him. He was a relatively short hispanic guy, and my nerves were getting bombarded by the creeper vibes he was giving off. (I can only compare it to the vibe that you get when you're out clubbing and you suddenly spot the guy lurking in the crowd sporting the slicked-back ponytail, sunglasses, over-sized shirt, and sagged pants combo who just so happens to be headed in your direction.) I did my best to appear calm and keep the mood light and friendly. He made some comments about how late it was and how no one was around but I just signed the receipt as quickly as possible, gave him my thanks and an awkward smile, and hightailed it out of there as soon as he handed me my food. I could feel him watching me as I climbed the stairs back to my place.

Once I got back into my apartment, I shrugged off the situation and reasoned that it was just my paranoia and overactive imagination acting up again. I had just turned on the T.V. and was about to take my first bite of pizza when I got a text from an unknown number. It read:

""Ur hella sexy [pHiLdO]""

I connected the dots and matched the text number to the call that I had received earlier from the pizza delivery guy. My initial reaction of course was shock since nothing like this had ever happened to me before, my hair was nappy and tied up in a messy ponytail, my face was probably greasier than the pizza I was eating, and to top it off I had my glasses on-- definitely not a pretty picture, much less anything that could even come close to resembling ""hella sexy"".

The next morning I got a call from my boyfriend, John convinced me that I should report it to the campus police as a precautionary measure. I gave them a call and an officer stopped by my apartment a few hours later. I relayed my story, he took some pictures of the text message, and he wrote down Phildo's phone number. The officer then told me that he could contact the Domino's if I wanted him to, but that it would most likely result in Phildo's termination. I was still relatively unphased by the whole situation and I told the officer that I just wanted to make sure that this creep never did this to any other girls on campus, but at the same time I didn't want him to lose his job. The officer then started asking me questions about how I felt after my encounter. Questions along the lines of -- Do you feel threatened by Phildo? Do you feel safe in your apartment with the knowledge that Phildo has both your phone number and your exact address? If I wasn't scared before, I definitely was now and during the course of my ""questioning, I ended up giving the officer the go-ahead to pursue my case and contact the Domino's.

About a month later, but that he couldn't get in because the keys weren't working. He also said that it looked like someone had broken in because there was some glass on the floor and a wooden board across my living room window. I was pretty upset because this was my first time hearing about it, so I called the school the next day to figure out what the hell had happened. Housing transferred my call to the public safety department and the officer I spoke with was only able to tell me that, according to their records, a maintenance worker had called them two days after I had headed home to report my broken window. Public safety had responded by boarding up the window and changing the lock when they noticed it had been tampered with. I convinced the officer to let my boyfriend into my apartment so he could check if anything was stolen, and thankfully, nothing was.

My gut tells me that it was Phildo who did it. It was Phildo who tried to pick my lock and then broke my window. It scares me even more now when I consider the fact that nothing had been stolen. My flat screen TV was right by the window that had been broken and my boyfriend's fancy road bike was sitting right there in the living room. Why didn't he steal anything? Does that mean his intentions were to break in and get his revenge on me, it still makes my heart race when I think about what could have happened if I had still been in my apartment at the time.

1362692156.0,19vbxb,Pedophile coach and a very smart younger me,Vargetta,215,35,20,"Back in middle school I used to play basketball in the city league like a lot of young kids do and I had a lot of fun over the years getting to play on the same teams with my friends. I had this one main coach who I played under for a few years on different teams and he in turn had an assistant coach named Cam that would help out at practices and games. 

Cam was a nice guy who was was a lot of fun to goof around with at practice because he had a kid-like personality (always making jokes, there was always something a little bit off about him and the smart middle school-aged me recognized this. For one thing, he was a guy who was probably in his mid-30s coaching 11, 12, and 13 year olds but who didn't have any kids of his own on the team. He was also overweight and would always wear white t shirts with really bad yellow pit stains to practices and games. I don't know why, but this really creeped me out. However, both of these things weren't completely out of the ordinary and he was good friends with the main coach and other players' parents

During one particular season (I believe I was in 6th grade), he would give me 10,000 sports cards (mainly baseball, but they also included basketball and football). At the time, I was really into collecting cards so I jumped at the offer and during the next game I scored the most points with the help of my teammates. True to his word, at our next practice Cam had 10,000 sports cards in two large white boxes that he gave me. I realize that this sounds kind of far-fetched,000 is a lot of cards (I actually didn't believe he would really give them to me)

Anyway, but looking back at the 10,000 cards he gave me and the fact that the timeline of when he did these things lined up with when I was on his team, it seems that he was possibly ""grooming"" me as a potential victim. That article scared the shit out of me the more I thought about what could have happened, and I am so glad that younger me was smart enough to get away from him before anything did.

1343873166.0,xjh79,The Saw,pharma15,226,43,45,"Like most other first-time contributors I found this subreddit a few days ago and have been peeled to it. Some **amazing** stories and talented storytellers in here! I have only one relevant experience from my life that I consider a decent fit for this subforum.. and whilst it's not on the same level as some of the great posts in here I feel the need to contribute it anyway. The memory of this experience had completely slipped from my mind - for years I hadn't thought about it until one of the other stories triggered the memory and sent shivers down my spine. I don't recall the details as vividly as I used to but I will do my best.

I tried to keep this story short but it turned out longer than I expected. People complain no matter what

I grew up in an affluent suburb on the East Coast of the USA for most of my childhood years. It is a beautiful town with fields, and more snotty rich kids than you would care to ever meet. It was pretty safe, most of the crime was people from other cities burglarizing the town because it was wealthy (poorer areas were only a short drive away). Our house wound up getting robbed a few years later by 4 people while I was the only one home, which is a different story for a another day. Anyways back to it - I lived in an older, more modest part of town, still very nice but not as extravagant as most of the other developing communities. Most of the houses in my community were upwards of 50 years old and therefore *just starting* to dance around the criteria needed to consider them creepy old houses.

This takes place in the 90s - I was 11 years old at the time. I'm a male. Next to my house lived an awesome retired couple who liked to travel a lot. While they were gone I would go over their house once a day to check the house and take care of their fairly antisocial cat. I would always try to give him attention since I love animals and I knew he was alone but most days he would run away from me. Sometimes I would catch him in a good mood and he would want to run around

On the particular day in question the cat (his name escapes me) was feeling social. We played around for a few minutes and eventually it led to me chasing him around the house. The cat ran down to the finished basement, behind the TV - until the open workshop door caught my eye. Ah hah! Got him.

The workshop was situated so the door wasn't readily visible from the main area of the basement. I had been in there before so I hurried in and flipped the light switch on. As soon as light flooded the room, quiet, and fast.

I remember this part of the story like it was yesterday. The moment I turned the light switch on, just barely inside the workshop doorway, straining to hear him to try to figure out which direction he was running on the floor above me. Then I heard it.

An electric saw turned on behind me.

Out of nowhere. In this empty house occupied by only me and the cat.

I BOLTED. Out of the workshop, eerie silence.

Some time passed, I walked over to the master bedroom intent on calling my Dad to come get me. My Father (rest his soul) was an extremely intimidating man. Growing up with no parents in a bad area molded him into somewhat of a roughneck so just the thought of him entering the house alleviated all my concerns and suddenly I wasn't freaked out anymore. My Dad would come get me. If there was anyone in the house, my Dad would deal with them. I had nothing to be afraid of.

I sat at the head of the bed where the phone was. This part of the memory is foggy

I put the book back. It took a moment for the ""I might see boobs"" preoccupation to wear off my brain

My alert level went back to freak-out mode and I decided to just leave. I started walking towards the open bedroom door and froze when I saw something. For visual purposes let me explain the setup. Their second floor stairway was open. It had two sets of stairs - a small set of 4 or 5 steps, looking back I now admit that could have been my mind playing tricks on me. That's besides the point though.

Ok so freak-out mode is back in gear. I slammed the door, I was 11. Then I saw it. One side of the master bedroom had a window facing my house. I opened the window and started yelling towards my house for attention. We had trees in between our houses but it didn't take long for my Mom to come running through the tree line asking me what was wrong. I didn't explain everything I just told her to go get my Father because I thought someone was in the house. She ran back and within a minute my Dad walked through the trees. I *finally* got to breathe a sigh of relief. I told him the code for the garage and he came in, got me from upstairs, and then we checked the whole house together.

We found no one. All of the doors were locked and there were no signs of forced entry anywhere. The cat was in his cat tree/cat house in the basement. The workshop light was still on and there was both a mitre box and circular saw sitting on a workbench plugged in. Both could have made the sound but they were both turned off. Weird.

The line was dead because the phone in the kitchen was off the hook. It was a corded phone with a receiver hung on the wall and the actual phone sitting on the kitchen table. This freaked me out. However, tying it into some joke about me always being on the phone (I had just gotten my own line). Their kitchen had an inset ""dining area"" for the kitchen table, so three sides of the table are surrounded by wall and one side faces the kitchen. If you were facing the table, the cat's bowls were on the left side and the phone was on the right side.

I was still freaked out but I just laughed it off and quickly finished my cat chores. I went downstairs and cleaned out the litter box, and cleaned up food that had spilled around the kitchen table. Imagination or not, I was done with that house for the day so we walked back home.

Now if that was all there was to my story

Earlier when I was chasing the cat, I would have heard it. Even if I didn't hear it, it would have landed on the ground, not neatly on the table.

Someone else was in the house that day and they took the phone off the hook.

So I decide that I'm sure as hell not going to go to my house, and the car is still following me. I parked directly in front of the doors and locked eyes with the guy on duty through the doors. He starts walking out. I wasn't paying attention to the other car anymore, but the officer said it left.

So my first post on this subreddit is a bit of a twist on the usual stories I see here. I was looking around Barnes and Noble for a study guide to begin preparing for my GRE's. I was looking around where they typically would be, then goes back to her book. I was about to leave when I noticed a book on tantric sex right next to her. Now, I have heard about it, but I figured I'd take a look. blah blah blah, spice up the bedroom, blah blah blah, things you don't need to hear about. I move in to close proximity of this girl to grab my book, then feel that she is staring at me. I look over and smile, thinking it was another sketchy book not appropriate for her age. Now... My glasses are kind of outdated, so I pay for my shit and then leave. On my way out

So I slept on this issue for a day before realizing how creeptastic I was. Welp... thought I'd share with everyone on this sub before I forget.

P.S. The twist is that I'd rather not meet this girl again out of embarrassment and awkwardness.

1375110558.0,1ja2py,"overseas internet ""love""",lnm_throwaway,226,43,24,"Apologies for it being so long, and am female.

Back in the 1990s, and it wasn't until I told her I needed it for school that she relented. 

I took the internet right away. I was really into a certain video game character at the time, was surprised to discover that there was no site specifically designated to them. I decided to learn some html and in a couple of days, had coded a crude ""Shrine to _____."" Even though it was mostly a stack of &lt;img&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img&gt; tags, I'm proud to say it was one of the first of its kind. 

Through my site, a dude from Texas, and Guy, an 18yr old from Europe. Some set up their own websites, and before long we had a little webring going on. We would chat pretty much everyday, and Guy even mailed me an awesome book that was only available in Europe at the time. I still have it. At one point, Guy bought a microphone and we sort of audio-chatted, while I IMed him back in text. 

A year or so later, I logged onto AOL to find an email from Guy waiting in my inbox. In it, he declared that he was in love with me. 

Needless to say, or even talked about anything remotely romantic. How could he be in love with me? Being the shy teenager that I was, I immediately cut off all contact with him.

He didn't really take too kindly to that. He started IMing me any time I was online, and why wasn't I answering him? Back then, IM was a pretty new thing, so the privacy options weren't what they are today. The only thing I could do at that point was minimize his IM window. If I blocked his name, he would just make a new one.  Anytime I checked his IM box, he would just be there, chatting to himself, how he was going to find out where I lived

The thing is, that I had inadvertently become the target of a stalker who lived in Europe. Would she even believe me? What could she do with that information anyway? Go to the police? What could they do? The internet was still so new, and laws against cyber stalking weren’t even a blip on the legal horizon.

My fears were (somewhat) relieved when one day, of course, didn't respond. It was very fortunate that he lost my address, because for my family’s financial reasons, moving was out of the question.

He found out my sister's screenname too. My sister, trying to get her to give out information about me and our family, asking what I was up to, and where I was that day. That really pissed me off, being that she was just a little kid, but again, I had no idea what I could actually DO about it

I graduated from high school, Guy's starting IMing about how he saw my boyfriend's website, and how he finally saw what I looked like, and now that he knows what college I went to, he could find me. The picture went down immediately. I know, looking back, it seems like such a duh thing, but back then the thought of him being able to find me like that just never occurred to any of us. My name is pretty common

By now, find my boyfriend. I’m not sure if he wrote what he did to try to shock a reaction from me, but they were unnerving. My boyfriend begged me to change my screenname, but to me, that just seemed like giving in. I was really attached to my screenname; I was one of the lucky few who had one that didn't require numbers at the end. I didn't want to start my cyber life over on account of one jerk who lived overseas. He had been threatening for years to come and find me, and never did. At this point, he was a small annoyance in my life. I figured he was just all talk. 

I eventually did change my screenname, and I also had felt like I had outgrown the previous one. After I changed my screenname, the IMs from Guy stopped. 

Years later, guess who I get an IM from. Guy. He apologized for his past behavior, saying that he had been in a ""dark place"" in his life, and for some reason fixated on me to deal with it. He told me he had a live-in girlfriend now, and even though I was happy that he was in a better place, I made sure to keep the conversation polite but brief, being careful not to reveal too much personal information. That was the last I heard from him. 

Today

Tl;DR - knew a guy only online who suddenly says he's in love with me. cyber stalks me throughout high school and college. years later

1370640325.0,1fw0mg,Why I have a rational fear of all utility workers now.,,222,37,39,"I'll have to preface this whole encounter with some information. At the time this story took place, my parents were never crazy about me going downtown. They always told me horror stories about *""creeps and weirdos""*



Until I met one. 



On the night this happened, so we ended up meeting one another there. 




I honestly don't know when he began watching us, I told my BFF I needed to jet. While she didn't have a curfew (like most kids my age), my parents still ruled me with an iron fist. I had one of those as-long-as-you-live-in-my-house kind of Dads. 



So me and my BFF get to our cars and head back to my house since she was going to spend the night. We also knew my mom and dad were going out so we could probably sneak some of my mother's vodka and replace the stolen hooch with water (a move we thought was sheer genius back then). When we got on the interstate



I started to become suspicious when he'd been behind us for about 20 minutes. Why was he heading out of the city? He was in a work truck and I never saw those trucks where I lived in the suburbs. My BFF always took the back roads to my place and ultimately



She turned down the first back road and he turned, too. At this point, I'm starting to flip out because I have a horrible feeling in my gut. Everything inside my head is screaming *""JUST RUN! RUN INSIDE!""* This was before the days of cell phones, too. I couldn't call 911 or even warn my friend. I couldn't do anything except flash my brights at my best friend and hope she got the hint. 



But she didn't. 



She thought I was joking and started dramatically swerving in her car in response. I started honking while I flashed my lights and tried to mouth *""KEEP DRIVING!""* to her as she looked back. Nothing. She just swerved and honked back while she made crazy gestures at me in her rear view mirror. The problem is, I already had my seat belt off. I jumped out and screamed, 



*""RUN! SOMEONE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING US SINCE DOWNTOWN. I'M SERIOUS



At first she looked confused because he'd dropped back a bit, but you could tell he was wearing a cap. All we could see was this tan arm hanging out of his window give us a casual wave as if to say, *""I'll be raping and murdering you both tonight,""* and I imagined that behind the shadow where his face should be was a big ole smile.




WE TOOK OFF. 



As soon as the door closed I made sure every deadbolt was engaged and every chain was on. Feet moving as fast as my heart was beating




She says



*""You know if I call the police and tell them this guy followed us from downtown my parents won't ever let me do anything with you again.""*



After about an hour of constant patrols around the house and peeking outside the front window, we actually started to laugh a little bit at ourselves. I go to put my smoke out in the ashtray on our porch when I stop dead in my tracks. 



Three houses down



My BFF wonders out loud if maybe he lived there the whole time. I tell her no. I know who lives there. That anxiety sitting on my chest returns





We make it inside and at this point



*""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING



I'm not entirely sure what happened to me, but it did. I grabbed the cordless phone in my other hand and went straight to the door. Once I got to the perfect center of my driveway, I held up the cordless phone in the air and screamed, 



*""I'M CALLING THE FUCKING POLICE



(Insert bad ass cocking of shotgun here)



As soon as I got on the phone with the police, he didn't even look scary or threatening. He was just a plain-looking Hispanic guy in work clothes. That's it. No warts or rotting teeth or any of the other things one's imagination might manufacture for a crazy night stalker. 



This time, it was more like an angry buzz and it never failed to stop making me jump the twenty years we lived there. 




We got up and ran to the door and could tell by the spot light looking at our address outside that it was indeed the cavalry. Sweet relief washed over us both and we went outside to tell the cops what happened. Right as they are kind of half laughing at us in disbelief, too. 




The cops returned about 15 minutes later to tell us how it went down. He cooperated fully with them and said he was just checking a transformer in the area (BS). Since it was his job to be around neighborhoods late at night, warn him that they'd be watching the house to make sure we were alright. Sure enough, that did the trick and we didn't see him again. 




My parents got home about an hour later, after all?




About six months later



(But it doesn't hit me yet.)




 The news starts and I hear




""A local utility worker was suspended without pay today after he was arrested for charges of indecent exposure and stalking of minors....""




**That's when it hit me.**

See,what he does. For example, he always called me a pathological liar, when in reality all he could do was lie, or calling me autistic and stupid, when he showed obvious signs of mental illness. Regardless, I've been told I'm the bad guy for so long

Thank you for reading this. You have no idea how much it means to me.

Now

I have made a few friends by the time I'm 16. Most of them know how scary Brian is. In fact, he thought he saw me knock a knockoff Ipad onto the floor. He ran at me, and held me 2 feet off the ground, by my throat, in front of all of them. I made eye contact with 3 of my friends, and my friend Jon looked like he was about to beat the hell out of him. Jon said, ""Brian."" In an angry voice and he dropped me, ""I'm going to fucking get you later.""

(I should mention, GOD HATES YOU! REPENT! HIT ME! HIT ME! SHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS! WHY DO YOU HATE GOD? Because Jon had work the next morning and didn't want to listen to worship music with him, but wanted to go home. Jon eventually pushed past, and that was the last time he came over.)


Brian decides I need an exorcism. He's done this to me two or three times. I'm 16 years old now and I've been through utter shit, that's all this is."" So I'm convinced that I just hate him because I'm a teenager. But deep down, I know something has to be done.

So he comes into my room, and everyone will judge him for it, and she's saying all these slurs. I rush to the computer and see it's on my newsfeed- M.I.A. the singer has posted some raunchy statuses. I try to explain it to him, and he slaps me and calls me an idiot- that my friends are disgusting druggies and he's sick of it, and that he won't be allowed to lead his small group if I ""Keep being trashy.""

I start standing up for myself, and Brian begins to kick it. Kicking my door in. I shout at him to stop, and he walks away. I think it's over, this is a daily thing for me. Until I hear the sound of a knife clicking. See, he had unlocked my door so many times with knives, if you pop anything metal and thin in it, the lock bursts open. And that's what he was doing. 

He bursts through my door with the knife and begins screaming in tongues, and scoot backwards onto my bed, putting my knees up and beginning to cry. He pulls be down by my hair, and I'm flailing and screaming, and he's still holding the knife. He punches me in the stomach, knocking the wind out of me, and while I'm gasping he drops the knife a foot away from my head. He climbs onto the bed and sits on my stomache, and begins to scream in my face

I begin to twitch and scream and sob- I still have a phobia of being held down- and he sits there, repeatedly smacking me in the face and shouting ""Demon, OUT!"" while I hear Jack, a mere thin wall away, watching the Golden Girls, having a great time by himself. Every time I close my eyes, Brian slaps. This goes on for an hour and a half, gets off of me

That day I had enough. I went online

I finally contact my moms' family. My twin brothers, that month as I found them. Most of them couldn't offer help or didn't want to get involved. Brian's brother was appalled when he heard my story. He promised to help me, but he's a dirty excuse for a person. I'll get to that later.

It's just me and Brian at home one night. I biked 3 miles home at 11pm, calling the home multiple times to come get me.
He's watching crappy television shows. I walk past, this sets me off. I run to my room, and he laughs. 

I come back out with a 5 pound weight. He stares at me and laughs, ""What the fuck are you doing?"" and I do it again. He starts to stand up and says ""Don't hurt my daughter!"" 

I start to laugh, and slam it into my ribs, nearly knocking the wind out of myself. He starts to run at me, screaming, ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH MY DAUGHTER,DEMON!"" and slams me into the wall behind me, bruising my back. I hold my balance and shove his ugly, merely staggering him. I manage to avoid most of his punches and get a few shoves in. He grabs my hair and holds me up by it

I look at him and say, and I lock the door just in time to grab the home phone and throw it into my closet where he can't reach it. For some reason I decided this was a good time to change my soaking clothing, but the moment I have my pants off, he kicks the door in, charges at me and THROWS me with all his might into my wooden cabinet behind me. My back cracks, and I hit the back of my neck, instantly giving me a  pounding headache, so my mouth is bleeding.

I fall down in a heap, and I'm aching. My mom immediately comes home, and screams at him to stop, charging at him, and he's distracted for a mere moment.

I pull myself up and follow them out there, and is playing defensive, standing up for himself.

I join her for a moment
I'm proud to say, right into his face. He retaliated by punching me in the throat, but that one moment was worth it. He looked me directly into the eye and said, ""I'm going to kill you."" and I replied, ""You're going to prison.""

I turned around right then, and pulling myself into a ball, dialing 9-1-1. I began to sob on the phone, and the police were there. They walked inside to find Brian calmly sitting on the couch , acting confused as to why they were there, despite blood still being on his face. The moment the officers saw me, they knew exactly what had happened.

Many photographs, but guess who showed up to that trial to say that I was the bad guy, and not Brian? His brother, who I begged for help, and my youth pastor. They spoke about how Brian was a great man and didn't deserve to lose his family. Unfortunately, the fact Brian's testimony didn't add up to the one he wrote down that night didn't put him into a good light.

Luckily

His mother still sends me letters
I wasn't granted the restraining order

I should mention Jack only moved out a few months ago. I went to him for left after Brian left, that ""I had no way of knowing and that's your business, not mine.""

I contacted his family, and I saw at court he had a leg amputated. Not sure why, but hey, fuck him.

Unfortunately, and he still has ""Assault and battery"" on his mugshot available to anyone who googles him.
I hear he's been going to a new church now

If a middle-aged man named Brian with short, no job and tacky hawaiian shirts wants to hang out with you, run. Just run. 

But this isn't the last time I saw Brian.

Immediately my mom's maternal defenses go up and she starts trying to steer the conversation away from us. He keeps going in circles

I distinctly remember him saying ""You have the most beautiful kids."" Which wasn't too far off--we all had bleach blond hair and stark blue eyes--but the way he said it while eyeballing me told my mother it was time to get out of there.
She sends me back to go collect my siblings while still talking to this guy. I guess he picked up on her change in mood and abruptly says ""Thanks for the conversation

One evening while Jenn was getting the kids ready for bed she heard the door open and thought it was her husband. She began to talk to him from the other room until she met the person (not her husband) at the stairs. It turned out to be an older woman. Jenn asked who she was and what she was doing in the house. The woman's response was ""My boyfriend told me there was a party here and he was invited. He can't make it so he sent me to let you know and to bring a dish"". 

Jenn said ""There obviously isn't a party here"" and told the woman she needed to leave. The woman said, you know him!"" She told Jenn about the church her and her boyfriend were planning on starting where you could drop kids off after you kidnap them. She said without something like this church, ""kidnappers are just killing the kids when they have nothing more to do with them after the fact"". She then pretended to call her boyfriend, when in reality she had a conversation with herself by putting her hand to her forehead when she spoke and taking it off her forehead when he ""answered her"".

Jenn, ""I can help you put them to bed, I've watched you do it a bunch of times"". Jenn was horrified and yelled at the woman to get out of her house. The woman got mad and said ""You stupid bitch! I want your kids. I should have taken them when I had the chance. I was standing over you guys while you slept, I just wasnt ready to take them yet!"" After the woman said this, Jenn forcefully made the woman leave her house and called 911 and her husband.

The woman stayed in the driveway and the police questioned her and searched her car where they found two car seats and a big box of diapers. It turns out she had been watching them for weeks and planning to take their kids that night.

This happened two days before Ted Bundy was finally caught.

For background on Ted Bundy, many female victims, always young and pretty, which is exactly what my mother was. Just under two months before this story takes place, he went into a Sorority House at Florida State University and murdered two girls in there, and brutally beat two others. Then he went to a nearby house, and brutally beat up and injured one more, that was the most recent of his known murders

Now to my (well, and had a Monday science lab that would let out at unpredictable times, dependent entirely on how long that day's experiment lasted.

My mom had not yet found a job, so she walked back to their apartment.

As she was walking, at least the color) was coming down the street toward her, and leaned over and waved at her in a really friendly, excited manner. My mother was rather confused - she and my dad didn't really know anyone down there, but she gave a small wave back. They had met another young couple a week before, and for a second she thought it might be the husband, but then thought it would be weird for him to wave so excitedly at someone he only knew a little bit. 

She suddenly felt really uncomfortable about it

As she did so, that he had his head tilted up and was blatantly watching her in his rear view mirror.  She also knew the particular duplex he was stopped in front of was vacant, so there was no way he was waiting for someone or anything like that.

My mom was thoroughly freaked out and trying to figure out what to do at this point, and she realized that if she walked behind it, she could then walk away at such an angle that the tree would block his line of vision of her for quite a while, and he wouldn't know exactly where she was.

She did this, and his car was gone. She figures he realized she was onto him and didn't want to deal with a woman putting up a fight.

As I said at the beginning of the post, but changed his mind, and that's why he was back in the area.

So yeah. Thankfully my mother was smart and not killed by Ted Bundy

1368783925.0,1eic6b,I don't think they wanted to teach me Hungarian,courters,209,30,24,"I have wanted to share this here for a while

I was 22 when I first moved to Europe. A stint in Paris led to a transfer to Budapest. I was pretty excited for this and threw myself into the move. Once there, I wanted something frugal, but nice. 

I found a flat in the VIII district. No one told me that this was perhaps not the best area for people, leafy, and residential. I didn't think it was a bad part of town at all. For those who have been to Budapest, I was in the back-end of the eighth, near Stadionok, which is now Ferenc Puskas Stadion. This is remarkably close to Keleti Railway.

On my bike, but it was at a steal of a price with utilities built in. I was jazzed. I took it without looking anywhere else.

Nothing really happened the first few weeks. I moved in towards the end of August when nights were still relatively long and being new to the city I was always home before dark. It was after living there I realised that the street I walked down - Szazados Ut - didn't have many, but at the time it was just being gentrified. Anyway, as I adjusted to Budapest I made friends and started going out, but I was pretty much always on my bike to and from the city.

Then I got asked out on a date. This was mid October and not wanting to ruin my hair and wear a small skirt I opted to take the metro into town. The date went okay and I was on my way back around 10pm. October in BP can be chilly, warm tights. I also had a scarf on. All in all, when dressed up I looked a little bulked up because the coat was made of really good wool, but I was clearly a girl. I stepped out of the metro, crossed the road, and headed down my familiar walk home.

It was pitch black. New Moon maybe, I felt. No one else was on the street, a car whizzed by me. 

Now

Anyway, and another two or three minutes and I'd be inside and warm. The car, however, stopped. He was stopped a little bit between the alley to my house and the other turn off. Lights stayed on. Car rumbling. But parked.

I cannot describe the dread I felt. My heart seized up. I immediately stopped walking. It was like my body knew something was wrong, stopped between it and another road. I could see behind me the lights of the metro station, but it was far away and no way I could run there before the car could catch up to me, even going in reverse. The Penny Market was closed. It seriously felt like minutes while we both stopped. Maybe it was. I just knew walking forward was not an option.

I then thought, maybe they are having trouble seeing the street sign? Regardless, I knew it was *wrong*, so I made a resolve to cross the road, go to the alley, and as soon as I broke through there, I'd be at a 24 hr petrol stop. No problem. I walked backwards, as if to say I wasn't scared. Spoiler alert: I don't think running a marathon in high heat could produce such a high heart rate as I said. Two steps into it, and had a heard better shaped to look like a brick.

My Hungarian at this point could best be described as ""how to order a glass of wine and say thank you"". But I did know how to say ""I don't speak Hungarian"". It's a pretty useful phrase anywhere you go where you don't speak the language, he started to speak me. I didn't know what he was saying, so I sort of just word vomited out in the squeakiest voice ever that I didn't speak Hungarian in Magyar. At this point, I was across the street, but stopped, and trying not to break into a run into the Alley way yet because my heart rate was up and it had quite a bit of debris in it (lots of people threw trash and such there since it was near a dumpster). I kept one eye on him and one eye on my route through the market alley, which was completely silent, and would need a solid 1mi run to get to the gas station. 

He looked at me and said

Yeah. Nope. That is not happening. I shook my head a little bit and then, but somehow I channelled Usain Bolt. I was not hanging around. I cleared one obstacle, jumping over it, but hit a pothole hard on my ankle. As I was running, I had my best friend in Budapest's name highlighted on my phone. I pressed send. When Dave answered I was crouched behind some trash cans and hysterical, telling him someone was trying to get me. He didn't really understand, but told me to STOP TALKING. As he would admit later, shouting at his friend, which helped me calm down as I waited there

And then. Silence.

No one was there. His footsteps receded. They gave up. I'm shaking like a leaf at this point, call a cab, and wait for it at the petrol station. But, hey, I'm 22. They must have given up on me, right? And I wanted my home. I had to work the next morning. I couldn't wear what I had on to work. I was stupid. I felt calmer with him on the phone, so I stood up and ask him to just stay on the line with me while I walked home. He really disagreed with it, as most 22 year old young adults think. 

I walk out. And there's the car. It's moved down the road and the passenger door is open. I realise they think I ran down the alley to pop out somewhere else. Oh, Dave is right - I need to get the fuck out of there - and I start hustling backwards hoping they don't see me, another car comes behind them and honks impatiently at the guy to move. Reluctantly, I see Wayne Rooney, *sorry*, the other guy get back into the car and the two cars roll off at a snails pass, like they're keeping an eye out. Still, I would be home

I decide the best course of action is now to just go home. Quickly. Dave still thinks I should really head to the station and get a cab and come to him. But I felt like I'd beaten it and was sort of buzzing on adrenaline

As mentioned, which was off of Ciprus. On Ciprus, as well, versus this road, cars can turn and drive down it. Ciprus went to a dead-end. I was obviously still really creeped out, but beginning to wonder if maybe I played it up too much, and am just being dramatic. To sort of get over how scared I was, all while nearly running home. I cut through the construction and decided to opt for using the actual key, while I got my key ready. I figured I'd do this because though we had a code to unlock the door

I swear to God that decision saved my life. I had only found out a few days earlier, I couldn't get in. He told me to try the keys on my ring and sure enough: that worked. Funny how that happens, right? That something a few days earlier, by accident, would come to play such an important role. I used my key to unlock my door and as I step inside - chatting amiably with Dave, and probably loudly, which was ridiculous -, trying to catch it before it shut.

It was him.

I screamed so loud that Dave promptly also startled and starting shouting at what was wrong, frantically locking it and praying I wouldn't open it by accident, but wanting another level of security between us. I think I kicked my phone down the corridor, running for the stairs. I just know, I snatched my phone up while the guy pounded on the glass halfway down the hall and nearly fell over from sliding in my heels. I didn't know anyone in the building and I knew the building was probably half empty at the time due to it being new and an investment property for a lot of people (looking to rent - and, now, understanding why people didn't want to rent there). I had no idea who was home or not home. But I knew I heard the shattering of glass as I dashed the flights. Thankfully, so no light would be seen in the window, and started to cry.

I didn't leave that position until my friend got there. Sure enough, there wasn't anything to turn so the door wasn't unlocked. Having to go down and unlock the front door for him was the most terrifying walk of my life. I was so scared the guy was waiting in the building for me to emerge. Down there, seeing the glass, it really shook me up. I let him in and I don't think either of us spoke much as we waited for morning.

The next day I broke my lease (I tried to explain but the landlord didn't speak English) and stayed with a friend until the weekend

1368161768.0,1e1vwr,The Sewer with a Secret,AAtheist,214,35,44,"I'm a 32 year old male, in their defense


Anyway, a quick back story: my siblings and I didn't have the most parental supervision growing up, but we certainly didn't have the least, so that allowed me to explore and roam free through the surrounding neighborhoods and parks more than some, of which I took full advantage.  My parents divorced when I was no more than four years old – mainly because my dad was a severe alcoholic who couldn't get out of bed without having drink, which is in no way relevant to this story.  My mother was left to raise us three kids on a legal secretary's salary while my dad went to rehab, so my parents were going through their own struggles – I'm not knocking them at all, it understandably left the door open for me to “explore.”


With that said, I was aimlessly exploring, which brought me to a park about a mile from my home, which is like a light-year to a seven or eight year old.  I think I was with someone else, some other kid drifter, but can't recall for sure.  I remember this park had a distinctly large hill (great for sledding, I once plowed into a tree there).  It also had a little shallow creek, just big enough for a young boy to walk into


It wasn't uncommon to test my bravery by seeing how far into the dark sewer I could walk without shitting my pants in fear.  I should mention that this was around the time after Jacob Wetterling disappeared, so this especially added to the creepy vibe.  I remember being freaked out and consciously worried about being kidnapped all the time – especially with all the media attention it received.  Even though he lived no where near me in a rural area about 80 miles from the city, my young mind had no awareness of distance; it happened down the street for all I knew.
  

During this particular game of bravery, where the light was still illuminating the way.  That's when I discovered there was another mini-sewer tunnel to my left, on the wall, but much too small to travel through.   That's when I saw something - I noticed an object just laying there in the entrance of the mini-sewer, like it was put there.  As I approached, I remember thinking it was a fish or something, but oh how wrong I was.  As I got closer, and noticed it was fleshy with veins sticking out of one end.  Fear slowly consumed me as the reality of what it was hit me.  I was staring at a severed human penis.  I saw the mushroom part


I wish I could tell you that I ran to the police, I guess, that I must have just chalked it up to part of our game of bravery we played – like it was make believe, or the wild imagination of a child, although I know it wasn't my imagination.  To me, that severed penis is still a secret of that sewer... and will haunt it until that sewer is no more.

I live in a small town of, I worked as a gas station attendant on the graveyard shift. Most nights I would have little but steady traffic through the station.

The only exception to this was on holidays, when those companies were closed.

Holidays were slow and boring but

This woman was very...dirty. She looked to need a bath and

She started in with a story about how she was from out of town and her car had broke down on the interstate (this makes me think that it might have been around Thanksgiving or Christmas because we got a lot of these stories). She didn't ask for money but

Her story was immediately full of holes. She had said that it broke down on the interstate. Besides the fact that gas wouldn't fix a broken car, oh well.

I asked her how she'd gotten here without gas and she told me that a friend dropped her off. I told her that I wasn't carrying any cash on me

That's when the reality of it kicked in. She didn't want me to buy anything. She wanted me to come outside

At that point I picked up the phone and told her I'd call the non-emergency line for 911 and see if they could help her. She couldn't make excuses fast enough to get out of the store. Not twenty seconds later I see the truck pulling out from the blindspot and hauling ass. This time I could see that there were two people in the truck.

I called the other open stores (there were four stores, which happened a lot in that nearby neighborhood.

The story doesn't end there. She came back around 6:30 bugging people in the parking lot for money but luckily it was full by that point so no one was in that much danger. I called my assistant manager

Because of the report I had to stay longer than normal. I was finishing up by taking out the trash and I decided to throw the bags in the back of my truck and take them all at once than a few at a time.

As I finished throwing away the trash. The same truck came speeding in and blocked in my truck. I figured they came for some payback. The parking lot had thinned so I figured there would be trouble. Instead she starts giving me a different sob story and asking for money. I pulled a baseball bat from my truck and just started screaming obscenities at her and telling her never to come back.

1365709914.0,1c5mnf,My Uncle - Finally Getting This Off My Chest,Arat90,222,42,49,"**WARNING: This is going to be a wall of text**

I can’t help the way I write, you should probably hit the back button now.  Thanks to whoever decides to read this, (:



As a long time lurker, but I’ll try my best to remember everything.




I think the first time I met my uncle was when my family moved to Michigan.  I had to have been around 6 or 7 at the time.  Just to clarify
My mom’s side of the family is enormous, just like the rest of my aunts and uncles.



Some things  I think you should know before I continue on with this story is that my family, and there was a more traditional way of raising kids.  It’s not uncommon at all for adults, and kids alike, to be patting butts, kissing and pinching cheeks, and hugging.  It’s just one of the main ways we show our affection for each other.  When someone older than you is speaking to you, you have to address them in a specific way.  You always show your elders respect, you are at their mercy.



So anyway
I would soon find out that my uncle was not like the rest of my family.

There was the first instance I can remember that occurred shortly after we had moved.  I was playing outside in the front lawn with my brothers.  They had moved on to playing tag or something like that, at least the first few times it was.
I think my mom was looking for an apartment for us to move into because we were living with a couple aunts and uncles and their kids in a smaller condo at the time.  My uncle asked me if I could go with him and show him where the apartment was.  At the time I didn’t think it was strange for him to ask me that
I ended up saying no, he’s an adult and like I said, you always listen to your elders.  By the way, nowadays I fucking hate my family.  My extended family, that is.
So we’re driving and I’m in the front passenger seat.  I don’t remember anything we talked about or how long the ride was, which was not normal.  I laughed thinking he was just kidding with me and tried moving his hand, but he just shoved harder until he was right there, between my legs.  I don’t remember what happened after that, I just remember thinking, “I don’t think this is right….I don’t think uncles do this”.



I didn’t tell anyone about what happened because I thought it was a onetime thing, and forceful.  No one ever forced me to kiss them.  He would grab my butt whenever he saw me, harder and rougher than anyone normally would.  It seemed like whenever I got within arm’s length he would reach out and grab me to run his hands all over me.  When other people were around he would hug me or put me on his lap but leave one of his hands between my legs.  It was highly unsettling and made me feel horrible.  I didn’t know whether to run and cry, start punching him, or tell someone.  A big part of me knew what he was doing was bad, the other part of me thought I was the bad one for not “listening” to him.  Sometimes the way you’re brought up can really mess with you.



Fast forward a couple years later when I’m in 5th grade or middle school.  I don’t think I had seen him in a while at this point.  I was home with one of my brothers, fear and disgust.  I reluctantly let him in.  
He made me kiss him and grabbed my butt while I tried to pull my face away.  I waited for him to sit down, WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!”.  He asked me to make him some food…..which consisted of a microwaved hotdog.  I wanted to leave the kitchen and go in my brothers room but he kept talking to me.  I was scared the entire time trying to figure out what might happen.  To my surprise, after I don’t know how much time had passed, he got up and announced he was leaving.  I felt the relief wash over me as I watched him put on his shoes.   He put his hand on the doorknob and I walked closer, getting ready to close and lock the door once he left.  As I walked toward him, he turned around quickly and grabbed me with both hands.  He half bear hugged me, grabbing my butt and holding me against him as he stuck his tongue in my mouth and positioned me against the door.  I had no idea what had happened, I wanted to scream for my brother but his mouth was covering mine.  After what seemed like forever



Several more years passed.  I was in high school and I remember there were many occasions where my mom told me he wanted offered to pick me up from school or take me to run errands to “help out”.  I would instantly become furious and demand that I be left out of the equation.  These were the rare times I would raise my voice and scream at my mom.  She would freak out on me and wouldn’t understand why I was acting the way I was, and even to my brothers.  We never talked about it in detail together, it was just an unspoken known thing that he was touching us inappropriately.  There was a time where one of my cousins and I finally told an aunt.  She told our moms.  They didn’t believe us.  My aunt told us never to be alone with him again.  The older I got, the angrier I became.  I hated him so hard.  Every time I saw him I would walk in the opposite direction to avoid him.



I’m 23 now and sometimes he’ll show up at other people’s houses.  I still get panicky and frightened when I see him.
I think it’s time I end this story.



As I’ve mentioned in the beginning, and I hope this can help someone in some small way.

When I was 7, after being constantly pestered to ""take me to the park"" my dad complained to my mom that I was old enough to walk the short distance to the park and play without supervision. My mom has always been very overprotective and a worrier, and even more so after this camping trip. My mom finally gave in and allowed me to go alone to the campground park. 

While at the playground, we crossed paths with my parents, who were going to another family's RV to visit and socialize. We let them know we were going to play Barbies in my family's RV. After we played for a little while, she suggested we pack up the Barbies and go to the cabin she and her grandparents were staying in to play with her Barbies too, which we did. It never even occurred to me that my parents didn't know this girl or her family or where I would have gone. They had assumed we were going to stay in my RV and play. 

We played at her cabin for a long time, they said they would drop me back off at my RV on their way so I wouldn't have to walk. Obviously, my parents had always told me to never get in a car with a stranger, and I knew this... but it just never occurred to me that this was exactly what they meant. I genuinely never felt remotely afraid or concerned about the situation. The little girl's grandparents packed up their car, and we all climbed in. We stopped at the campground's general store, and her grandpa bought us both ice cream cones. All I could think was how nice and generous her family was! 

We got back in the car, my door flew open and my dad, with tears pouring down his cheeks, yanked me out of the car and hugged me harder than he ever had in my life. I was so confused... and then the car I was in sped away, very quickly. It was then that I realized that we were at the exit of the campground. 

Apparently, my parents had contacted the ranger station and a lot of people were out looking for me, in the woods and going door to door to the other RV's. My dad just happened to be walking by as he saw me in the people's car, just about to leave the campground. I don't know who those people were but they definitely had no intention of bringing me back to my parents. I think the ice cream was  bought to distract me from noticing we weren't heading in the direction of my own campsite. Over the years, I've often thought of that day and how different my life could be if my dad hadn't seen me just in the nick of time.",,False,t5_2t3t8,True

It was back when I was about 10 years old (17 now), if not less, walk from my house. About halfway through the walk, a rain storm came out of no where. Being 10 years old and just wanting to get to my friend's house, I decided against running back for a jacket. When I reached the street off of my friend's street, an inconspicuous white van pulled up beside me. The sliding door swung open, and a lady in her early 30's asked me if I wanted a ride, I told her I was going to a friend's house just up the street and that I was fine; to which she insinuated that I had to get in with them

A little backstory on the van: In my southern Ontario city, and I kid you not, a white van abducting numerous children; and actually I believe one of the children believed to be abducted by this van was actually killed. The van was described as a white Dodge Caravan, and I always remembered this because it was the same type of van my Mother drove, but she drove a blue one.

Anyways, as an elderly man with a forwards ballcap was always seen driving it; and I was absolutely mortified when I looked towards the drivers seat to see an old man with a ballcap at the wheel. I'm even getting chills thinking about this, let alone being alone on a street with these creeps in front of me.

When I noticed the old man, I glanced to look at the license plates, which were obscured by a garbage bag. The total time elapsed between the van pulling up, me saying no, the lady trying to get me inside and the realization of the situation was probably about 45 seconds.

When I realized what could possibly happen, I heard the lady curse ""fuck"" and the door come whirring shut. the van began to accelerate again, but luckily for me, after cutting across a few lawns, I was maybe 20 meters from my friend's house.

As I reached my friend's house, living in a condo
had about 15 steps, and looked through the glass and saw him slowly walking towards the door. At this point I was screaming ""Cody, for God's sake, open the door!"", and then turned around to see the van just arriving across the street, maybe two doors down (in a suburban neighbourhood, so maybe 50 feet away). My friend perked up and bolted towards the door

To save some time, and didn't know what to do; his parents weren't home, nor were mine, and wouldn't dare go outside to fetch help from the neighbours. We were on the border of calling the police.

This is where it gets real fucked up.

We picked up the phone, so the phone and internet was extremely unpredictable; and with the now harsh weather, it was no surprise that the line went dead.

We layed down on his living room floor (it hid us from plain sight and allowed us to look out the front window) and began peering outside with a pair of mini binoculars he had in his room. Sounds extremely BS, we wanted and excuse to use the binoculars.

My friend handed them to me, and he stopped his breathing. I remember whispering ""What is it, dude? What? Dude?"" and then before he answered, banging began on his garage door. Dead. Fucking. Serious.

We almost fucking pissed ourselves, the garage was in close proximity to where we were (the living room, 15 feet from the front door), we could hear everything. We heard the handle on the garage being fumbled with, so we grabbed kitchen knives, and proceeded down the stairs, silently. When we got to the bottom of the first flight of stairs, I believe, Brian. He wasn't there.

We were petrified, we silently listened to the noises outside from the garage, communicating in gestures. The attempts to gain access to the house were sporadic, and occurred over a time frame of about 15 to 20 minutes. Eventually, everything ceased. I held my breath and my heart stopped beating. After about 20 seconds of staring at the garage handle, we heard a single word: ""Fuck."". It was the voice of a man, and that single ""fuck"" rung through my ears like a bullet and caused me to not sleep for nights on end. After standing there in shock and fear, we gathered the courage to make our way back upstairs. A few minutes later, when we peered through the peep-hole

He wasn't.

The van started up and left.

Edit: You might be asking why no neighbours began to take action; my friend lived on the very corner of his dead end (at the time) street, who was never home. The chances are slim that anyone would have seen this whole thing go down.

Edit 2: You may be angry about the cliche opening of the door, pointed directly at his throat. I realize it sounds dumb, but this worker was always ringing my friends door bell to come in to check the meters etc., as it was a developing area; so he recognized him as a familiar person.
We were also in an extreme moment of panic

A bit of background is necessary. I have been in Canada for the majority of my life, it may be important to note that my dad had already gone to Canada to get things set up (get a house, job, etc.), so we could go join him. In the mean time, it was just my mom, my two older, sisters and me, she waited...and waited...and waited. No documents, in the middle of the night

Fast forward, asking how they are and all that. My mom starts to wonder who she's talking to, but every time she asks, this woman changes the subject. They have a long conversation and hang up, feeling better about it. Such a pleasant phone call. She calls again tomorrow. My mom again has a long conversation with her, but she's slightly more annoyed now. She keeps pushing her for an identification, until the woman finally says ""do you remember that time when I told you that I had some documents for you?"" My mom suddenly realizes who she's talking to and this only encourages her. By the end of the month, as if on cue, after a few abusive comments from me and my sisters

Eventually, who were spread across three continents, as well as my dad's cell, my sister's work and my brand new cellphone, whose number I had not given anyone, let alone this psycho bitch. Not only was she getting all these numbers, but she also had a lot of information.

My mom may have encouraged things a bit, she claims that there was a car there. I don't know if I believe this, but this is a woman who has access to people in four or five different countries. No one really knows where she is.

This story isn't really very chronological now that I think about it

My parents took a trip to Iran once to visit family. They wanted it to be a surprise, my uncle was there to pick them up. When they asked how my uncle knew, he said that he had received a phone call saying that they were coming. Every house they visited on that trip got a phone call, while they were there.

More recently, whose husband drove over and told my dad who told my mom. Well, we get that trusty phone call, except she doesn't want to talk to my mom, but rather my mom's mom. When my mom pushes her to tell us why, she says that she wants to tell her about her dead son.

There was also a period of time where we would get a series of calls that were just white noise with some music in the background or people talking

Well, they went to the police. This woman always called from blocked numbers and the one time when her number wasn't blocked, it was a calling card. Anyways, the police looked into it a bit and said that it was impossible to tell where she was calling from and that we would need to hire a private detective, which we weren't going to do. Since then, the calls have been fewer. I make a point of screening ALL calls now and we often get callers that don't leave a message, but it's difficult to tell if they're her or just people who don't want to leave a message. I guess we'll find out how good she is by whether or not the calls increase after I post this. After all, finding a reddit account would be a cakewalk.

Tonight, but at 4 in the morning, everything is a hell of a lot more eerie. 

So, but I've learned to get over it. Anyway, I'm walking back, freezing my ass off, when I hear the sound of shuffling feet. I turn around, and I see a dark figure (this person was out of the light being cast by the spotlight, so I couldn't see them). This freaked me the fuck out immediately

As I'm rounding a corner, and the person coming at me is cast in shadow. But I hear a deep, booming voice shout, ""Why aren't you running?""

This both confused and startled me, but a black hood covered their face. I began SPRINTING to get to my dorm, and I could hear their feet pounding along on the pavement behind me.

""Run! Run!"" they both whooped and shouted, and turned around to see the Hooded Guy standing right outside. I grabbed the door's handle and pulled it while he also pulled. We were playing tug-of-war with the door.

My dorm has a small area where we swipe our ID badges so we can be let into the residence hall. This area is right inside the door. So it's like a very small, I swiped my ID with my right (thankfully my ID was on a lanyard that I kept), so it was easy to get to.

I live in a town of about 11, we are moving when I get a better one). I was on my way to my employer's house (he runs the company out of his basement until we get new office space). I was being tailgated BAD by a ratty blue car and a white bald guy.

I drive a Kia Soul

He honked at me. Whatever. I flipped him off and slowed down to five miles under the speed limit. There wasn't anyone behind him so I wasn't ruining anyone else's day. He had chances to pass me on the county road but didn't. After a few minutes with NO other cars around and him still kissing my bumper at 50 mph

I came to my turn but decided to see if this guy would follow me. I turned left and he followed. Then I came to a roundabout and thought I would lose him. I traveled the entire thing around twice...he followed me. At this point I knew he was messing with me

I pulled up and parked

He was in his 40's I'm guessing, nothing scary there. The interior of the car was pristine (I was looking for a gun). I should mention here that I'm training to be a behavior analyst and while I work with kids right now, my hobby is criminal behavior and profiling. I was seriously trying to read this guy.

A few seconds went by and I grabbed my phone again. This time intent on calling 911 from the police station parking lot. As I dialed, rolled it back up, and took off. I went inside and told an officer what happened. Sadly I was too focused on not crashing to get a plate. Apparently there have been a lot of complaints about tail gaters recently, multiple with a blue car.

I filled out a report with the officer and they gave me a card for victim services and a local women's shelter (just in case he followed me home one night and I didn't feel safe

Serious horror-movie stuff.

1358571382.0,16v12k,My Neighbor's Father,mylittlelamb,200,28,30,"When I was between the ages of 13 and 16 I lived across the street from a family that was very well known in our town. The family consisted of a very sweet mother, their father. Their father was well known for being the kind of dad who buys their under-aged sons alcohol and makes sex jokes with their young, southern voice. He was the older guy that you think is really laid back when you’re a kid

I’ve been openly bisexual since I was 13 years old, “I know what you’re going to be doing tonight” with a little grin on his face. Sometimes, the comments would be a little overboard and uncomfortable (very vulgar things), but if you brought that kind of thing up with any of the sons, you were in trouble. They loved their dad, and they were the kind of guys who would fight you if you were a boy and ruin your social life if you were a girl just for speaking ill of their father.
When I was 15, and we got flirty but not intimately. She seemed like a really nice girl. After talking to her for about a week, we found out that she often hangs around in the neighborhood that was right next to mine. It was only about a 15 or 20 minute walk from my house, if I took a short cut through to woods, so we decided one day we would just meet up there. When that day came, I put on some make up and started my walk. As I was passing my neighborhood pool I heard a voice from behind me yelling “hey hoe!”. I turn around, and, it’s the boys’ father in the pool parking lot, and I told him. He asked if I wanted a ride

He asked me why I was going to this neighborhood, about the girl I had met online. I could tell he was happy to hear that, in his sick, perverse way. He said to me, “I had a dream about you the other night.” I tried to be nonchalant, I asked him what it was about, knowing I didn’t want to hear it. He told me the premise of his dream in detail, partly because that was 4 years ago and partly because I don’t really want to remember. But I do know he started with “The wife and the boys were out of the house, he made a U-Turn and went back.

Once we got into the neighborhood he began questioning me about this girl, and say that I didn’t really know her at all. Every young girl we passed, he asked me about. First he asked if that was the girl I was meeting, then he’d ask if I would sleep with her regardless. One of the girls we passed looked to be about 12 years old. He said something objectifying and disturbing about her, once again asking my opinion. I told him she was too young for me, and definitely too young for him. I’ll never forget the way he looked at me when he said, “Age ain’t nothin’ but a number.” With such perverted lust.

Finally, “do you know this or that person?”, “what do you do for fun?”, and the like. But the experience I had just had with my neighbor’s dad was really weighing heavy in my mind. Not to mention he was still texting me, asking if I liked her and if I was going to be with her physically. I had to tell her what had just happened. I told her everything he had said to me as she listened silently in disgust. Then, I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed that he had been following us from a distance. Not taking all the same roads (cause I had been nervously checking to make sure he had left), but he had found us again. When I told her, and I was too. We drove to the gas station, I asked her to take me home
The whole rest of the night, and also because I knew, in my naïve 15 year old brain, that I could not turn him into the cops. I couldn’t call the police because I was so close with his youngest son. I couldn’t send his father, whom he loved so dearly, to prison. That’s not what a “good friend” would do. So, I only ever told a handful of my friends. Almost all of the girls I told said, and texts me all the time, before he really hurt someone.

A few months ago, and I wanted them to see this man in action. So, they read over my shoulder, saying that they themselves some how felt violated as well. Sure enough, he told me that he still thinks about me having sex with other girls. He went into detail. And I know when he thinks about it, in his mind, I’m still 15.

My husband and I lived in a tiny 1950's bungalow in a cute little town-the type of place where Main Street is gentrified with trendy restaurants and art galleries but surrounded by lower/working class homes. The area was pretty shady but we bought it in 2005 for what we thought was an absolute steal in the hopes the area would turn itself around (with the economic downturn

Anyway, I saw a car's headlights slow to a stop. I didn't think too much of it, as our street was pretty heavily trafficked. A few moments later I heard my dogs start barking and a loud knocking at the door. Thinking it was a neighbor, I went to the door and pulled back the blinds (the top half of the door was a window) and saw a man with a bandana covering his face, pointing a gun at me and screaming. I'm not sure if it was another language or if I was just too stunned to understand what he was saying, but I turned and ran with my dogs toward the back of the house as three gunshots fired behind me. My dogs and I ran into the backyard and I plastered myself against the house. On the other side of the fence, I see the car from before still sitting there. I jumped as two more gunshots fired into the backyard

My neighbors were all too scared to come out at first, and got in touch with my husband at the gym. The police came and collected evidence and said there were footprints on my door, as if after he shot the assailant tried to kick in the door. They asked me flat out who would want to kill me and the answer is no one. My husband and I have never had enemies of any sort and the only thing they could figure was it was either some sort of gang initiation or case of the wrong location. Why they would shoot at a girl in her pajamas, I have no idea. One of the bullets lodged in the doorjamb of my living room right at my head level, if it had been a few inches to the right it would have hit me. Another bullet ricocheted into the dining room, which was the next room I ran through. 

We packed up that night and went to my parents house and I never spent another night there again.

In the mid 70s

I remember that house. It was my parents first home that they didn't rent. It only had one bathroom, dressers, appliances, a living room set and a new color television. I can remember my mother doing a little dance in the kitchen because she had a ""real"" refrigerator and a dishwasher. It was set up on rail road ties and the wheels were removed and my dad put a lattice work curtain thingy all along the bottom to keep the animals from getting underneath. The week before this particular incident happened I cut a gash out of my side just above the hip from running around the front of the house and not remembering that the tongue of the trailer frame was sticking out about 5 feet. The little latch that secures the ball hitch into the receiver is what got me. We'd lived there about a year when this story takes place. 

We bought a section of land that was at the entrance of the road that went to the plaza. It was a dirt road and it followed our property line to a corner where the road made a 90 degree turn and followed our property line up to the state highway. About half a mile past the entrance to the plaza

You should know a little about the plaza or ""the bottom"" as it was called. The road into the bottom was the same dirt road that passed our house. That dirt road was one of my mom's biggest gripes; everyone drove too damn fast and the damn dusty

All of the houses in the bottom were built on stilts because the river flooded every year. The water from the river sometimes got as far as our yard, there'd be twenty or so cars parked on both sides of the road in front of our house and everybody would come and go in the boats. The cars were left unlocked and some had the keys in the ignition. I was warned by by my father on the threat of death and dismemberment to stay away from those cars. 

Another thing you should know about the bottom is that most of the people who lived there were unemployed or underemployed and mostly uneducated. Everyone down there hunted and fished. There was also a still or two and pot plants actually grew wild in places as well as in five gallon buckets on the occasional deck or elevated porch. The best way to politely describe the general population of the bottom is ""hillbilly."" Oh

It was one of those communities where everyone knew everyone else and a newcomer was treated with suspicion for the first fifteen years they lived there. It was a community where if you got caught doing something wrong, that meant a whoopin' on top of the slap or chastising or whatever we got in the first place. All of us kids knew each other because we all rode the same bus to the same school. And since the bus couldn't navigate the rutted roads of the bottom on a good day, all of the kids waited for it in our front yard. My father eventually built a bench with a roof on it for everyone. 

On the night of this incident

This was in a time before Atari and Nintendo and CDs and DVDs and VCRs. We had an aerial antenna that pulled in a grand total of three channels that were clear on only the best of days. My brother and I were standing at one of the lower windows watching the lightning strike. 

I was watching a car come up the road from the bottom. The dirt road was loose gravel over compacted clay and it got slick in places when it rained. About once every three months, I'd go and look for change that had fallen out of the car. I even found a box of bullets once. I got a spankin' for bringing it home. 

Anyways, my brother screamed bloody murder in my ear. He was screaming so hard that his body locked up and he lost his voice and just made a rasping noise. When he screamed, it scared me and I screamed. My mother came running from the kitchen, her bathrobe spreading open like Batman's cape. She grabbed my brother who was still trying to scream and asked him was happened. At the same time she was scooping him up with one arm, she was pushing me away from the window with the other. When she pushed me, she accidentally hit my bandages from my encounter with the tongue of the trailer. It hurt and I started crying too. So now we're all three on the couch. Mom is doing her best to comfort the both of us. I am OK after a few minutes, but my brother is still hysterical. He had the hiccups and was trying to tell her what he'd seen. He could only say ""boodah"" which was his word for monster or booger. As it turns out

As my mother held my brother and was at the window showing him that it was only a big cow, but she was so scared herself that I could hear I could hear it all. 

""Debra

""Yes

""I have an emergency

""Debra

Finally my mother was able to call the police. She told them that she was looking out the window to show my brother that it was only a cow in the yard when the lightning struck and she could see a man in the tree in our yard. 

""Yes!!! He's in the tree

""No

""Turn out the lights? Are you crazy?""

""Oh.... OK

She gave them directions to our house and hung up. Before she turned around

Mister Trachalek said he'd come over and stay until dad got home. He said that he would be there in about five minutes. Mom hung up the phone and told me to get come into the den with her. There weren't any windows in the den. 

We went into the den and could hear the rain coming down harder than ever when we got still. She put my brother onto the sofa beside me and went to the bedroom to get one of my dads pistols. The ammunition was kept in the cabinet above the kitchen sink

In frustration

The man was outside the kitchen window looking in at her. His face was less than two feet from hers. I remember her stumbling back into the table where she'd left the pistol. She grabbed it and pointed it at the window and just started pulling the trigger. Luckily it was empty because it was at this time that Mr. Trachalek started banging on the door. My mother spun towards the door and pulled the trigger some more. Then she heard Mr. Trachalek calling her name and unlocked the door for him. He stepped in out of the rain with a shotgun as big as him (he was a little dark skinned man) and asked what was going on. She was hysterical. She tried to talk calmly but ended up screaming anyways. 

""He's in the back yard! He was looking through the window at me!""

As she said this, we heard him shouting and then 'boom.' Silence and then 'boom.' and then silence again. 

By this time

""Son of gun shot at me!"" He said it like he was surprised and had his feelings hurt. The held up a hand with two fingers spread apart like a peace symbol and said ""Twicet"" with a ""t"" on the end of it. ""I can't believe he shot at me!""

My mother got him a towel and he told her how the man had pulled out a pistol and shot at him as he came around the corner of the house. He told my mother that the man shot once and then ran and jumped over the chain link fence and then shot again before running down toward the bottom. Then he said that the man was the tallest man he'd ever seen in his life. ""Flat footed jumped that dern fence

He said that he'd wait with us until dad got home. My mom was making coffee when the sheriff stopped outside with his lights on. He'd just trotted up to the door when my father pulled into the yard. They all started talking and were still talking when I got sleepy and fell asleep on the sofa. 

The next day

The one thing that I do remember that gives me chills to this day was the sheriff standing outside our trailer house under the window that was over the kitchen sink; the window where my mom encountered the prowler. The sheriff was talking to Mr Trachalek and had asked him to go over everything step by step for the third or fourth time. The sheriff wanted to confirm that the prowler was standing under this particular window; pointing up to the kitchen window; a good foot and a half above his head. 

""What was he standing on?"" The sheriff was looking around for a stack of bricks or something. Mr Trachalek said that he wasn't standing on anything. ""He was just standing there with his hands behind his back looking into that window when I came around the corner. He just turned and looked at me and pulled out a little pistol and shot at me

Anyways

One thing that I thought was just a little bit weird is that when I got in my car and drove out of my garage, I saw this cars headlights turn on. When I got onto the interstate and started driving to the high school, I saw the person following behind me.

I still decided not to do anything about it and when I got into the parking lot

It was about 5:00 and the lights still haven't turned on in the parking lot and that's when things started to turn shitty. The guy who followed me from my house got out of his car and started his way in our direction wearing a black jacket that covered his face . We were all in one big group and I noticed immediately when he got out of his car. This is when I started to feel my adrenaline pumped through my entire body. The man in the jacket starting running towards us and grabbed the smallest kid in our group. When he started running off with him. Me and two of my football defensive lineman friends bolted off of our coolers and HAULED ASS towards him. We all tackled him at the same time and threw his ass to the ground with a force of up to about 600 pounds. We held him down and called the police and later found out that he was on the loose for 3 weeks. Damn did I feel like a hero after that

TL;DR - Me and my friends tackled a child molester and I felt like a badass.

Well I wait at the airport for them as their flight gets delayed...for over 3 hours. Around the time they land and we pack up their bags, then travel another hour back home. I mentally braced myself for a long trip and drink a Red bull to give me a jolt of energy.

As Im pulling out of the airport parking lot, and it stayed a ways behind. However i notice after ive made several wrong turns (none of us had GPS and they were giving me directions from memory) and corrected my course, that this car is still cruising, slowly but surely, behind us.

I think to myself its a weird coincidence but took a mental note of it. Eventually we get closer to their neighborhood

Two men. One had a bigger silhouette and the other kept shaking his head like he was trying to get a crick out of his neck. Now they have my full attention; why the hell are they still behind me? For some strange reason im hoping that this is just a stupid coincidence and my sleep deprived brain is causing me to become paranoid. 

Until they follow us into the neighborhood. ""NO FUCKING WAY"" I say loudly enough to wake my sleeping passengers. I fill them in and they shrug it off

We pull up to a stop sign and I suddenly gun my SUV. I begin whipping around turns

A minute later the car comes roaring down the street. The whole family is on edge now telling me to just head home. I tell them to give me it second. The car come roaring back down the street

We eventually got to their house and brought all their bags in with no hassle. They were dead tired

1333095596.0,rknye,[My] messed up Valentine's Day,1nf1del,198,22,30,"When I was in high school I lived in a really small town in Texas. It was the kind of place where everyone was either related to each other or hated each other. I had no family there, occasional fights

So, my girlfriend and I decided to skip the school dance and just stay in and watch a movie at her house while her parents went out. Just better to avoid trouble. We borrowed her dad's car, a little Honda hatchback, and went into town. We stopped at the video store for a movie and went to the Dairy Queen for some ice cream and then headed home. Now, she lives in the complete boonies - out in the middle of the woods along a lonely road with no streetlights.  We're chatting, eating our Blizzards when all of a sudden a car comes up behind us. No big deal.

What was a **very** big deal was that when the headlights flooded the interior of our car I saw two hands on the backseat and a head coming from the hatchback part of the car.  As soon as the lights hit, I just have to stop at my friend's house real quick."" She knew that was bullshit, I didn't have any friends!

I pulled over at the next house that came up and jumped out of the car yelling at her to jump out too. She jumped out in total confusion

He popped up like a jack-in-the-box with empty hands waving

It was some weird kid from our high school who we had never in our entire lives spoken to before. Ever.  I said

We sat there staring at him with our mouths open wondering what to do. He tried to act real cool and obviously we were in the middle of nowhere in some random person's driveway, she was so freaked out. 

I have no idea what he was trying to do when the lights caught him crawling out of the hatchback.

1365919235.0,1cbaxs,Scariest moment in my life...,RodBlake,204,27,12,"  This is something that happened to me about two years ago

  I used to live in a small town in rural Missouri with my Mother and Step Father. Our house was a few miles outside of town and along an old state highway. We were pretty isolated out there, So I just started a movie and quickly drifted off to sleep. I remember waking up to the sound of my parents leaving. After that, I slept rather soundly. 
  I must have been asleep for a couple of hours before I was woken up to the sound of the front door opening and closing. I laid silently, ""Where is everybody?"". My eyes shot open and i looked up to see a man standing over me. I had never seen this man before. He was tall and muscular. He was wearing a white t-shirt with cut off sleeves. He was also covered head to toe in blood. I jumped to my feet instantly. I had never been so scared in my life. Trying to rationalize, I asked, ""Are you looking for my parents?"". He stared at me for a moment and asked who I was. I replied by asking ""Who are YOU, and what the fuck are you doing in my house?"". He stared at me blankly. I thought I was going to be murdered. He kept talking incoherently and asking where everyone was. at this point, I had no idea who he was referring to.
  After about five minutes of nearly crippling fear, drove the man to the hospital and as far as i know he was okay. 
  Though i understand the situation now

1358831811.0,171f9t,Let off with a warning...?,LunarTears,203,29,36,"Awhile back

I worked the night shift, so I know that I wasn't speeding. After driving for about a mile, I notice a car starts following me very closely. After a couple of miles of this, I've decided I've had enough so I switch lanes in front of a few other cars and keep driving. Predictably, this person (it was too dark to see anything but their headlights, as there were few streetlights in this remote area) weaves in and out of cars to get back behind me. 

Finally, and admittedly I did get up to 57 mph as this person continued to tail me. 

And he turns his lights on. I'm already nervous

He approaches my window and chides me for speeding, I know) saying that I had a device from my insurance company that also tracks my driving. He claims he saw me weaving 'all over the road', and assumed I was drunk and I question why, if I was speeding so seriously and driving so poorly, he followed me for 13 miles--passing said obvious drunk drivers and people speeding past us to do so--instead of pulling me over immediately.

Ignoring my question

The cop gets out, during which I quite obviously get my phone out and tell my coworkers what's going on.  He then gets out of the car, returns my information claiming he let me off with a warning, and drives off quickly. 

He returned my registration, I called the station looking for my license and of course he hadn't turned it in. I told them what had happened and gave them some information that they asked for (including some numbers on the ticket) and they said they'd look into it.

The next few days I did see a cop car on the roads near my house, I'd been planning a move and moved out of state just a week or so later, but I hope that my complaint was looked into and that man didn't do anything wrong to anyone.

So I will preface this by saying that I've been to France twice and both times I was hit on relentlessly by middle eastern men who live there. They are usually very forward but never make any attempt to harm you and will go away when they notice you aren't alone or that you are firm in telling them to buzz off. 

Anyways, definitely. However, it is very close to the red light district and so it's best to go there during the day. A Parisian man told me himself he'd never go there at night. So my tour group goes there in the afternoon to visit. There are a lot of stairs to get up to the area and a lift if you don't want to walk. My friend Ashley had sprained her ankle before the trip and so she wanted a ticket to the lift. We tried to buy them but the middle eastern man at the booth adamantly refused to sell me a ticket until I gave him ""a french kiss."" I refused and kept trying to buy a ticket but he was stern on not giving me one. We decided to just walk up the stairs because I was tired of the looks he kept shooting towards my chest. 

So we visit Montmarte and it's lovely just as we expected. The group all gathers and we leave to go to the next place we were scheduled to be at for dinner. The group is walking quite a ways ahead of us but they're all clearly visible and it's not yet nighttime. Ashley and another friend of ours and I are all walking, blocking the way. He tells Ashley that she's very beautiful and that he wants her. We say nothing and keep walking but he follows, he keeps showing up in front of us, like he can fucking teleport or something. At this point we're panicking, though technically we aren't in too much danger. We're just far from our group and afraid we won't catch up to them and be lost. He is absolutely relentless in following us, with this disgusting yellow-toothed grin plastered to his face. Finally he reaches out and grabs Ashley's hair, tugging her towards him. She screams and all three of us break out in a dead run. 

At this point one of the chaperones see's what's happening. She also freaks out and starts yelling ""STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRLS!"" Getting all crazy mama bear on him. He doesn't care and continues to chase us

1344869336.0,y59rs,Someone knew our number.,NavywifeJP,215,37,33,"Hi! This is my first post on any Reddit

These (maybe connected) stories happened when I was 13-17.

The first was a four year experience of ""Unknown Number"" caller(s) who would call my sister's cell phone I shared with her and then hang up. Often, which made my mother think it was a prank from one of my school mates. But what changed was when I was 16-ish. I was with my friend ""Terry"" when we got one of those calls. It had to be around 7 or 8 at night and I was sick of the crap.

I picked up the phone and put this person on a group call. My sister, he called back. We put him to voicemail. He called again. He called 5 more times before we decided to do something. Terry called the police using her phone as I checked the voicemails. They were all some unrecognizable guy and girl, laughing and saying our names. They sounded like adults, but were completely incoherent and hysterical. One minute, they were angry, the next laughing. It creeped us the hell out. The police said they couldn't trace the call, and when we asked Verizon to

Eventually, like any normal day, when we walked up to three police cars, lights flashing, parked in our driveway. We caught two men with guns out sneak through our first floor garage. Not knowing what else to do, we followed them, opening the door inside the garage to see them walk up our stairs. My mom's boyfriend ""Ray"" had left it open to mow the lawn in the backyard

""What the &amp;*^% are you doing?"" Lexi asked. One of the police officers turned to us with the gun pointing downwards. She looked angry from what I remembered, who was standing like a stone in the kitchen.

Apparently, that there was someone in the house with a gun trying to kill her. I was suspicious of my sister at first, since we did have a cell phone and it sounded like something her stupid friends would have done as a prank. But the police officer confirmed that the call was made from inside the house, using our home phone. 

This happened once more later that year, the police were much more understanding and were actually worried for our safety. Nothing came out of it, and my mother still lives at home safe and sound. Though to this day, we still have no idea what went on or why someone would do that or even how. Anyway, thanks for reading!

1375990479.0,1jz5ij,Lost in Alexandria: Part 2,shamr0ck_,208,35,56,"* I was pretty surprised when people took interest in this. I wasn't expecting it. The second half of this story just gets fucked weird. And the third part is even worse. It was one of those nights that made me question whether paranormal was possible; because for this much to go wrong in the space of ~9 hours makes no fucking sense to me. But you asked for it. Here it is

[Here is part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1jy14q/lost_in_alexandria/)



In Alexandria it made sense that shit went wrong; I just so did not fit in there, and getting home took me a long ass time.

So I start my car up, y'know how when horses are close to home they start going really fast? I did that. I actually had a pretty good reasoning at the time; my car cools down when I drive it faster. So I sped up. And I hit a massive ditch in the road. Car made it out, thank god, but on top of heating problems I really didn't want to have to go and look, and the road ahead of me was still dark as fuck. But I heard the front of my car hitting the road and I'm worried about damage so with a ""fuck my life"" I step out the car to check it out.

The bumper was a little messed up, I had the worst luck with cars. Breaking down was part of a Saturday night for me, so I wasn't entirely useless at evaluating/fixing things that went wrong, and so far, from what I could tell, there wasn't anything notably wrong with my car other than some exterior damage. I scout the area a bit and it all looks safe, so I head back to my car and open the door. Then I get one of them ""AAAAH"" type of frights when I hear screaming off in the distance. It felt like Sin City only in a more rural, I swear he was toying with me because like a god damned horror movie, and an angry man.

But I hop back in and I drive on. Because of the left turn I took earlier I knew I was supposed to pull a little left-right to get back onto the main road that got me into all this, and back on the highway. But going straight, parallel to the main road, took me to a dead end. So imagine that between all the shitty houses and the barely tarred roads, this white cement barrier blocking the road off, and about 6 or 7 dudes with a fire sitting on top of it, chilling, and eating...fucking deer. I don't know if it was the same guy from earlier. Might have been. Might not have been. Overall

Anyways, I wouldn't even say in a bad way, they're just looking at me, and having been given enough reason to shit myself that night, this only made it worse, 'cause at the time I was pretty sure they wanted to rape me. I pull the turn around motion and speed off. And I really hated my life at that moment because there went the heat gauge. I was used to that; usually if my car derped out, I'd have to go for a few minutes, that wasn't abnormal. But on this particular day I just wanted to fucking get home and my car was not having it. I run it through red line for a little bit just to try and distance myself from...people.

 Anyways, open the bleeder (it's a little screw by the water tanks of BMWs that lets the pressure out) and step back in while I wait. In my rearview I see the dudes all walking towards me. I don't immediately assume the worst. I obviously grant credit to the possibility that they are sinister, but it seems about as likely that they just want to help. I don't fucking know. But they come up to me.

 

You'll have to understand that by this point I've had the worst night ever and I just feel utterly apathetic. Like I'm done trying. If you're scared for long enough you tend to just embrace it

 

So they come up and I give a half hearted ""Hi."" They're pretty cool. ""Howzit, smoked some cigarettes (most of them were just getting blazed Snoop Lion style).

 

From the other end of the road, 12:30AM by this point and I can't fathom why anyone would be walking around so late, but whatever. I'm gonna call them group 2 for reference and the first group group 1. I'm not very creative. Anyways. I understand the language somewhat (not well enough to speak much, but I can understand it enough to make out what happened). Here's how the conversation runs after pleasantries:

 

Group 2:  What's up with the whitey? (Turns and says hi to me in English)

 

Group 1: Car broke down

 

Group 2: Something something car something can take it

 

Group 1: Nah he's a brother (something along these lines

 

Group 2:That boy? There's no way he's a brother

 

Group 1: (skipping some in between talk here) What do you want to do?

 

Group 2: Freak him out and take his car

 

I've kind of had enough of this. Group 1 was nice enough to stand up for me, because it might keep me out of trouble, but in this case I think I did the right thing.

 

So I tap one of the guys next to me

 

He looks at me and says 'You have a gun?'

 

I motion for him to keep it down and I tell him I've got it in the car if we need to use it. He taps his buddy on the shoulder and whispers something. He tells Group 2 that I've got a gun (I don't), a few of them trying to shake my hand as they do, but fuck that. I was a little too cocky in eying them down though; to me it made sense. They were just conspiring to rob me, then smile and wave as they walk past.

 

But the last guy stops and says ""What

 

So I look around a bit and figure out what I'm gonna say. ""I speak Zulu.""

 

They all bust out laughing and group 2 asks what I heard. I tell them, pats me on the back and says ""Ah, alright brother"" and they head off.

 

One of the guys from Group 1 was nice enough to get me some water for the car, and I finally know where I'm going and it's super fucking simple.

 

I make it out of Alexandria, so here's what I saw on the way out.  Two things of note. And I still have a hard time believing that I could have so much fucked up shit happen in one night, but then again, I'm not really a patron of Alexandria, and my friends have told me some fucked up stories about life in the townships, particularly late at night.

 

First thing is easier to talk about. I come up to a T-Junction, I see something kind of weird. Something moving. Not exactly in line with my lights, but between two houses just off to the side, and there's a pretty small crack between them. So I squint and look really close and--no--what the--yep. That's a man sucking another man's dick. So that's something I never wanted to see in person. Or on video. But fine. The image lingered around for a bit but it wasn't frightening or anything.

 

But the next thing was pretty fucking terrifying. There was a little clearing, but there was this random spot of soil where a full on bon fire was going. Describing this is kind of tricky, because I'd never seen it before, I haven't seen it since and I know fuck all about it, and I'm sure it's not just a ""normal"" part of South African culture, but there were people singing and dancing while they made their way around the fire, and a few of them screaming. But there was a dude on the floor (might have been a woman, screaming his ass off, with a white tribal mask on. Screaming. And screaming. Right in front of the fire

 

Fuck. Me. About 6 blocks and I was out of Alexandria. I looped straight onto the road to Linboro Park and came to a stop at the intersection. Now I was really freaked out while I was there because the guy I was going to visit got jacked at the same spot not too long ago. Light turns green and I'm in the clear. Then I remember something. I don't have a fucking phone.

 

I make it to my friend's house and I'm outside. The house itself isn't that big, and the only way is either to call him on his phone or call loud enough that someone in the house wakes up.

 

So I'm standing out calling to him and not a fucking peep. It's dead quiet, or anyone, and I'm just in a fucking terrible mood by this point. In retrospect, I don't really know why I didn't just go home right then, but I think it had something to do with just feeling like I'd been through so much. Little did I know I was in for even more. Writing this now I realize I've never told anyone this full story. Just bits. But holy shit did this night get creepy.

 

I drove to a nearby gas station -- I say nearby, buy some more cigarettes and some Red Bull and just kind of hang out eerily. I'm thinking I need to make a phone call somehow, but asking around feels wrong, plus the gas station is 100% dead. No watch but I think this was near 2AM. After about 20 minutes I figure it's safe to check, so I slowly undo the lid on the tank and while I'm derping around with the radiator cables a bakkie rolls up. I don't know the American word from it. I guess truck? Y'know, those little cars with the open backs that you can load shit onto?

 

Context. In South Africa the Afrikaans people tend to drive bakkies 'cause for the most part they do a lot of labor or farming work. That's a stereotype, probably drunk, laughing loudly, and go into the store. When they come out I'm still knee deep in my car, putting coolant in with the petrol attendant, and they come up to me.

 

They're wearing wife beaters and Monster Energy caps, and the way they approached me was just creepy. They kind of boxed me in from both sides and asked what trouble I was having. I tell them briefly, not paying much attention to them. And then the one guy says, ""You know how dangerous it is out here? Some dude will come and stab you and take your wallet. We live close, why don't you come stay with us?""

 

So my fucking

 

And they go quiet and I look up from my car and see them both smiling to each other. And the other guy goes

 

I'm pretty much done by this point. I'm done trying to be nice or tactful to get through the night. I turn around, so to random petrol attendant guy, thank you so much. I call my friend and he wakes up and I tell him as briefly as I can what happened, just, minor details. He laughs and says he'll wait outside for me in 15 minutes when I come over. He has a laugh over my weird ass night but mid phone call I hear a scream:

""YOU FUCKING KAFFIR!""

 

Kaffir is a really bad word in South Africa. Imagine ""nigger"" on steroids. Seriously. Afrikaans farmers used to say it to black slaves, this word is fucking serious, and it's not something you hear actors blurt out ""by mistake"". It's just so taboo that hearing it makes me feel dirty.

 

I tell my buddy I have to go but I'll meet up with him soon, and he's pretty visibly scared.

 

I snap. I used to do a fair amount of fighting, because, hey, it's fucking late. They're both on the floor, not unconscious, but I'm so not interested in them that I turn away. I take the petrol attendant and make sure he's okay. He's just thanking me.

 

Then I get hit by what feels like a fucking hammer in the back of my head. I drop down and quickly turn around and sure enough the two of them are back on their feet. I put my legs up and kind of guard from a few half-assed kicks and think it over. I really didn't feel like fighting. The main reason I stopped is that my adrenaline rushes would make me feel like puking and crying for no damn reason

 

They back off. The one guy's face is bloody from the headbutt already. They get in their car and say ""We're coming back for you and that fucking kaffir!""

 

I'm not too worried because I'm gonna leave soon

 

I pull out and head back the way I came. I cross back over the highway

 

I turn my indicator on and he mimics me. I take a closer look at the car and sure enough it's a bakkie, one lane road that leads around to Linboro Park because the main road is closed off. Linboro Park is also as quiet as a quiet neighborhood gets, so I'm not going to run into anyone who's gonna help me and I'm pretty obviously being tailed by now.  

 

I rev my car as fast as I can. I'm not a great driver, but they're definitely trying to speed up and follow me. I go down the first actual Linboro Park road, kill my lights and make a right turn, which happens to be the road to my buddy's house. I kill the engine and park under a tree because that shit always works in Need for Speed. Meanwhile they roll past slowly and...see my car so they make the turn. I call myself a retard and quickly start up and drive off again.

 

My buddy Gordon isn't outside like he said he'd be, jump out and close the gate. The red necks stop their car and get out and start banging on the gate.

 

Gordon is massive. He's got that archetypical rugby player build. 6.5"" at least

 

South African gates are pretty secure, crime, and Gordon's family has had a lot of break ins, so they made the place Fort Knox with a crazy electric fence. So they can't get past but they can yell and be obnoxious. Gordon sizes them up and tells me that there's only four of them and we could probably take them. I tell him it's so not fucking worth it and we could just call the cops. He laughs and tells me to wait there. I'm not happy with it, but he drives my car up the long ass driveway while I sit there and listen to four dudes being pissed off. It was actually kind of funny, in retrospect, because all they wanted to do was beat me to a pulp but the gate was too much of an issue.

 

It takes forever but Gordon finally gets back. He steps out the car and with a big grin starts firing his paintball gun. It wasn't just one of those normal, whatever, and drive off. The funny thing is the pepper spray worked so well they couldn't even yell anything as they drove off, just flipped us the bird and ""aghbr, aghuii"".

 

Gordon was laughing his ass off and I can't blame him, confusion and all-round ""fuck this world"" to really find humor in it. I told him some of what happened. What I remembered. Truthfully though, he missed out on a lot of the details. A lot. So Reddit is the first to ever hear the full story of the most consistently fucked up night.

From what they've told me, although my parents assured me they thought I was being properly looked after). It had been roughly two hours, when they got a knock on the front door asking if me and the other kid were at our house, or if we'd been seen.

My parents immediately started to panic as they hadn't seen or heard either of us

We were found about 1 and a half hours walk away from our home, a minute later and we would have been inside the forest and at the mercy of this creep.

It turns out the lad was one of the neighbours kids, he said that he'd promised to take us to our parents and then just continued to walk. He claims to have not remembered leading us to the forest, and also said that he didn't know what his reasons were for taking us there.

1334992229.0,sl0qf,My date with a junkie in college,Rhynovirus,219,47,52,"This story takes place when I was 19 or 20 in college on the east coast of the USA. In a particular class we were given a team assignment and asked to turn to our neighbor next to us to cover the material. This is how I met Jackie. Jackie was 5'5-ish and of what I presumed to be slender build. I couldn't really tell because she was clad head to toe in a black goth-punk inspired dress. She looked vaguely Asian and wore thick white eye makeup which set off the highlights of her dye-damaged

For context, how popular I had actually been in high school among the underclass girls I knew through various clubs and sports. I was on the nerdy edge of normal for a college guy. Nothing about me would have made you think that a girl like Jackie would be at all interested in me. 

But I digress. We set about our work and completed our in class assignment. It turned out to be the start of a research project which we were to finish together and so we made arrangements to meet that weekend.  Everything went great and we completed our work quickly. While we were working we started talking about some common interests, I suppose, piqued her interest because she asked me if I'd like to go with her to a ""Gothic Industrial show.""  

I had no idea what that even was but I wanted to find out

Besides

10pm that night I walk down to her place to meet her. She's repaired her eyeshadow though the hair is still as unkempt as ever

No one is dancing.  People are standing there like the Zombies in I Am Legend just kind of rocking back and forth to undefined gothnoise droning like mind control waves through the air, I don't even have ID at this point, but fuck it I stroll over like a boss and demand beers. No questions asked the bartender hands them over. 

When I return to Jackie she has obtained some clove cigarettes which she shares with me. Sign clearly said no smoking but 0 fucks were given.  We ""dance"" to another few songs long enough to drain our beers when Jackie declares the show ""lame"" and asks me to take her back to her place. 

I oblige and as we walk back the subject turns to drugs. ""So what kind of shit have your tried?"" she asks me. Sheepishly I tell her I haven't done much.  She replies with her own list of experiences which could probably fill a drawer at the DEA.  Meth, Ketamine, Pot to take the edge off and LSD.  If drugs were Pokemon she'd be Gary Oak.

At this point I'm starting to feel like I'm in over my head.

We get back to her place and it's a fucking mess. Cigarette butts all over the floor, black thong underwear strewn about, half empty liquor bottles and Jackie's characteristic smell. 

Now I was feeling really conflicted. Something

We sit down on her sticky green shag carpet and start talking again about politics. Jackie was well read to be as messy as she was and we had a pretty good talk.  She disappears into her bedroom to shed her blouse

What could this be for? 

Right in front of me Jackie pours out 3 lines of coke and snorts 2 of them like they're Afrin. She offers me the straw. I decline... and so she snorts the other one with the opposite nostril. I would have been astonished except that she continued our conversation like nothing at all had happened. She was completely lucid.

We smoked cigarettes and continued our chat which eventually turned again to drugs and our drug experiences.  At some point I made up a lie about having tried acid

Eventually she realizes my relative inexperience and joyfully offers to let me try anything I want from her stash.  From a ziploc bag in a purple Crown Royal pouch she produces:

* stamp like things I presume were LSD
* several white rocks
* three small yellow rocks
* diabetes syringes
* a vial (which I later learned was ketamine)
* pot
* a rainbow's worth of pills
* various and sundry pipes

I did not know what to do. And with THC skewing my reason I was having a hard time figuring it out.  Jackie

...she begins to tie a shoelace around her arm 

...and starts cooking heroin in a spoon above the scented candle we'd been chatting around. 

...and after offering me first go (which I decline) injects herself

At this point all my DARE training from elementary school is kicking in and I know I have to leave or probably die.  I start to work out my exit strategy

""Oh yeah that is real good.  So anyway

It was unbelievable! By now I had a story worked out

Jackie broke a pink pill in half and swallowed it.  She offered me the rest. Feeling rude I accepted but cheeked it (and spit it behind the couch when she closed her eyes again).

She considered what I'd said for a second and replied ""Oh that's cool. You wanna make out? You can just crash here.""

She moved closer and put her arm around mine

I tell her I really need to go

And then she uttered these words I still vividly remember and possibly still fap to:

""I'm probably gonna pass out from the heroin soon so if you wanna fuck me after that's cool. I'm on the pill.""

I got my water but could still barely stand after all the weed. I tell her I'll crash the next time and after a kiss goodnight

One afternoon we were all playing in the front yard without my aunt, with greasy hair and a porn stache walks over to us with a huge smile on his face and tries to start talking to us.

At first we were wary, and he was looking to make some new friends. (with little kids?) He said he had a swimming pool, and we were all invited as long as we ""brought the 3 S's! A swimsuit, a smile, and a six-pack of Coke!""

Jeffrey Boop was a dangerous sexual predator and child pornographer. And wanted us to bring our swimsuits to his pool so he could make new friends. *shudder...*

ANYWAY.

About 5 years ago I worked for a nationwide telecom that I guarantee everybody knows (or knew) as technical support. If your internet wasn't working, I fixed you. Unless you complained about ping times, then we all secretly laughed about you and knew it was your mad leet skills getting you pwned, and not our connection.

But I digress.

I am a redhead

I was a measly Tier II rep stuck in a miserable job and there was a guy in Tier III named Jerry who somehow discovered my existence (we were literally on opposite sides of a building an acre wide). He would stop by often to talk with me

He never talked about having a wife, and that when he visited with his son, that was when he had custody.

I was single at the time, it became obvious he had a crush on me.

I thought it was cute and he seemed like a cool enough guy, and considered becoming friends with this guy, maybe more if the long-distance thing fell through.

That is

He commented often about my red hair and what he thought of red heads, and asked if I dyed it or if it were natural, if I felt more fiery because of it, etc... digging, it seemed.

At one point as I was leaving work a car suddenly shot out in front of me, it was Jerry waving and sporting a goofy smile.

Then small gifts started showing up on my desk that were strangely appropriate. Incense. Hello Kitty pins. A comb. After a few hours I would receive an IM asking ""did you find your surprise?""

These in and of themselves were not threatening, but excessive, more as if he was grasping on to any information he got to prove that he was listening and interested in me.

I talked him in to stopping with the gifts

But then other strange things started happening. At this point he was calling me up and asking if we could hang out at local bars. I went because I didn't have too crazy a social life. And when he found out that the LDR guy had started to come down and visit

After I drove up to see my LDR, and I found the screen popped and the window obviously opened. Nothing was taken, but something was left. A box of Hello Kitty bandaids was in my bathroom and a flower was sitting on my computer desk.

After I came back from a 2nd trip, professing love and quoting parts of famous German love poems (I speak German as a 2nd language).

I washed my car and said nothing about it although he asked if I had received any messages upon coming back. I played dumb

I started to get texts and emails constantly. He would just show up with food for me if I had posted on my blog that I had a craving for cheeseburgers. He decided that was our ""thing"", barely giving me 5 minutes notice via text. I was dirt poor, so they were a luxury and I will admit it... I didn't tell him to buzz off, I ate them. I tried to stress, though, that I thought he was cool and it was sweet of him but I fully intended to repay him because *that's what friends do*.

Basically

Then.... here is the crowning stupid thing of all stupid things to do... I got in a fight with LDR that I thought was really bad... bad enough that he wouldn't talk to me again. I was upset and made the mistake of mentioning it to him.... he was over 10 minutes later to ""comfort"" me.... yes

We get done and his phone starts going crazy in his pocket. He grabs it and looks panicked

""I'm really sorry

Wait. WAIT. WHAT??? *WHAT??!!*

And then I flip out, pointed out that he didn't have a wedding band... and he informs me that in his branch of Christianity, they don't believe in rings as only god can sanctify a marriage. So he didn't wear one.

I felt incredibly stupid

He literally RAN from my apartment

Which was not going to happen

Apparently his wife was monitoring him after that because I didn't get any more texts for a few days and I specifically avoided him at work. I was hoping to just ignore him in to obscurity and make peace with the fact that I'd pretty much had an affair. Just thinking about him made me feel dirty.

Then the texts started again, trying to drag me down in to a hay bail so we could have a quickie before going back to work. I told him each time that it was not going to happen and managed to get back to work.

He broke in to my place once more

I was at a rather cool pub with my LDR, I'm furious you took him there.""

Finally

His wife had told him that evening that she was pregnant with their second child

I was shocked, etc, etc.

A little later that evening I got an email explaining that she was really just angry because he had had an affair before with another red headed girl whom he'd gone to technical school with, was nowhere near as sensitive or amazing as I was.

That was it. I was done. I blocked his email, and I redid my schedule so he couldn't track me and show up at my usual haunts.

Even then

At that point I was scared because he was obviously unbalanced and he had figured out how to IM me. He was telling me about how he was going to die alone if I left him

I realized there was no way out of this, he invited me to move in with him. I quit my job and moved in with him promptly to get out of the area.

All seemed quiet for about a month, of which there were many (there were not). He even hinted that if he suspected I denied any of it, he had a hard drive full of photos of me in BDSM-type situations that I had willingly submitted to (there were not).

My beloved LDR calmly responded that we had talked about all of it

Seriously. Kids. Listen to your gut when it tells you to run like hell. I got a husband out of the deal

TLDR: Coworker doesn't tell me he's married, flips out on me, then harasses my boyfriend when I quit my job and move in with him 100 miles away to escape him.

* * edit * * - A lot of people are remarking on the fact that he broke in. There is a line between creepy and romantic and the *first* time it didn't seem creepy. It seemed awkwardly done in an ""oh

 After all, although that did set off alarms for me. Which, to reiterate, I was being a fool and not listening to. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT..

2 years ago, and I designed a barricade for the door that only a small female such as myself could pass easily through. 

I didn't use that spot constantly, but my intuition or whatever told me not to go inside. I really wanted to go up to my spot, but the closer I got the house, the more fear I felt. I decided to listen to my guts and sleep in the cemetery instead. 

I stayed away for a few days, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I didn't feel any fear or anything, so I went in through the back window as usual. Everything seemed normal until I got upstairs. Someone had obviously been there. 

The upstairs was even more trashed than usual. Furniture had been flipped around, it was on the floor. It was damaged at the place where it looked like it had been punched, but it was mostly intact. I think that's probably where they blood came from, they must've punched it and hurt their hand. There was what looked like semen on the mirror, and written in marker the words, ""This was for you, bitch"". There was blood on the mirror, ""Fuck you

Holy shit, but I wanted to check my nest first and grab a few things before I never, ever went back. I went up to the attic and my barricade was totally wrecked. I guess it wasn't so strong after all. It probably would've bought me enough time to escape out the window onto the roof below, where I could've jumped to the ground. I'd rehearsed the escape route in my mind many times. Anyway, my nest was entirely ruined. It seemed like somebody had been looking for me and got really fucking pissed off when I wasn't there. The room wreaked of urine, I think they pissed on my sleep spot. There was more semen smeared on the wall. 

I never went back there again.

The closer he got to me, and wondered if I could spare any change. His whole spiel about needing gas was clearly just a sob story to get some money out of me, but this guy was creeping me out, so I gave him the change in my pocked and tried to walk closer to my car. Again, he cut me off, preventing me from getting inside. I was probably about 10 feet away from it at this point. He stuck out his hand, and said, nice to meet you. What's your name?"" 

I replied, *really* upset about this. He said back to me something along the lines of, ""What, I'm not good enough to know your name? You won't even shake my hand? You fucking white yuppie piece of shit, thinking you can walk all over a scumbag like me. You're no better than me.""

He then grabbed my hand, shaking the man's hand. This apparently made him feel much better about himself though. He started telling me about how he had been drinking at a bar earlier that night and that he just wanted to get home. Then this guy got really crazy. I could see his eyes kind of gloss over, and he started talking about some club he was in - I think it was called Skulls and Crossbones, but I have no idea what that is, or if it's even a real club.  He then looked at me with this furious look in his eyes, his hand still gripping mine, and said, you're with *them*! You're one of them! They're looking at us right now, ""You are

He said, so I was free, but he was still standing in between me and my car. I slowly started circling around him so I could get closer to my car. But he kept talking, saying, ""When I was younger, I really fucked up my life. I did something awful. I ruined a young woman's life."" My heart was racing at this point, and I could feel my hands shaking, ""I don't know why I did it

My father is in a hospital in Roswell recovering from heart surgery at this time. We leave Brownfield and head towards Plains at about 10 pm. Well after dark but not too late.

As she backs off the car backs off of her tail. This continues all the way to Plains at which point I call my wife and tell her to pull over and she does so following very close to my tail. We stop and the car passes right by and pulls over on the opposite side of the highway about 200 feet up and parked. I get the gun from the glove box knowing how to shoot it well enough. I made a joke to my wife and mother who are scared shitless at this point. I get in the u haul and call my wife and tell her to follow close.

One morning

The gas station was only about one mile away, standing alone in the middle of the gas station parking lot.  And that's when I hear someone calling at me.  ""Pssst!  Hey, hey little girl!  Hey!""  the voice says.  I look over and see two teenage boys, maybe 15 or 16, standing behind the gas station.  They are taking a couple steps towards me.  I don't know what's really going on.  All I know is that this is scary.  They take another step towards me and point towards the back the gas station and say, ""Hey little girl.  Come back here.  There's a dead dog back here.  You should check it out.  Come on.  Come back here.  You'll like it.""  I manage to squeak out a, ""No, mentally preparing to ride away.  They take a couple steps again towards me, I can come get you and bring you back here to show you.""  Then one of the teens took a few more steps towards me with his arm out.  

Thankfully, my brother came back out of the store with our stuff.  I told him about the teens, but when he turned around to see them they had disappeared.  I don't know who they were, where they ran, or what they were really going to do to me.  My brother and I hopped on our bikes and got the hell out of there.  That is a scary memory that has never left me.  I was a little kid.  Truly creepy.

Well, and therefore out of reach (this went on for a fair few years, I tend to try to avoid the subject). On top of this I had been bullied my entire school life. So I spent a lot of time in deep thought.

I live in a beautiful place with rainforest encrusted mountains. It's always raining and it's just wonderful. So every afternoon I would go for a nice long walk in the rain

Almost every time I would go for these walks

Well, yet for some reason this never freaked me out. This time she gestured for me to cross the road and speak to her.

""Oh! You're soaked! You should come in and have an orange juice."" She said

I initially turned her offer down.

""Well

I didn't feel creeped out at this point or anything

So we sat out on her patio and talked. She offered me orange juice again but I declined. I'm not exactly sure why. After a few minutes of talking she asked me again if I would like to come inside. I agreed.

Bad fucking move.

She led me to the kitchen and again offered me an orange juice. I declined yet again and she insisted. Growing a little suspicious I declined a little more firmly. So she got herself a drink.

She then said she'd like me to stay and watch a movie with her.

""Okay

So she closed all the doors and windows and shut all the curtains

 We sat on the couch to watch ""The Cat in The Hat"". I was really uncomfortable with the entire situation by now. I think I only watched fifteen minutes of the movie before I jumped up and claimed I had to go because. My stepdad would go ballistic if I wasn't home soon.

I went to the front door and tried to open it. It was locked, it required a key.

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

That bitch had locked me in.

Starting to feel panicked but not showing it
I turned around

""Can you let me out

Wordlessly she showed me the key, spreading her arms wide and saying ""If you want they key, you'll have to come and get it.""

""Ew

I turned back to the door

""Come on

So I tried to get to that key. I had had enough of this shit. But she tried to kiss me at the same time so the end result was more futile wrestling. By this time she was the one closer to the door, I had just placed my feet I'm the stance I had been taught, turned my body and my fist I brought behind me and not at my hip. (I don't remember the exact stance so excuse me if I'm wrong, I only did a few lessons and that was five years ago, around the same time this happened).

She noticed and she actually laughed at me.

""Hahaha! You think your martial arts bullshit is going to do anything? Alright then. I like it rough. Just no face blows.""

She launched herself at me but again this was for a kiss

I was straining, sending her flying into the wall. (That was my only advantage. My legs were strong as fuck).

I took the advantage to spring back up. By now I was just angry as all hell. 

When she got up, a strange and unnerving mix, on her face.

""I told you not the face."" She said quietly.

""JUST LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE BITCH OR I WILL BURN YOUR FUCKING CUNT OFF!"" I screamed at her. 

""Oh

So I marched up to her and grabbed the key out of her bra and got out the door. She followed me outside. This place had a high fence so we were hidden from the road. It was then that I spotted her poor dog. The poor darling was completely emaciated

""And feed this fucking dog. The poor thing is starving. Feed it or I'll call the RSPCA.""

""I have some meat inside for him. Can you help me cut it up? I have a sharp knife but I can't do it myself."" She said. Okay that was fucking creepy.

""Fuck off

I never told my parents.

I think there were 3 or 4 of them, ranging in age from about 4 to 16. The oldest was living with another relative, though he never explained why. The others would come into the restaurant sometimes, and if I remember correctly

After we had been working there for a few months

Soon it started escalating even more. There was a Chinese restaurant nearby and Steve would go and get us meals during our shifts. He would also bring us little trinkets

One day we walk into work and another manager tells us that Steve has been fired. When we asked why, he wasn't supposed to be working there.

I've told bits and pieces of the story to people before

For the record I'm male at the time of this story I was about 15 or 16. 

So when I was a lot younger

Fast forward to my freshman year of high school. I got a random message on MySpace (haha remember that?) From one of the people I used to hang out with. This girl may very well have been the most fucked up out of all of them. I actually had a long history with her

Anyway

It turned out this party was really just me

Snow says he's 18 and spends most of the night making passes at me. I'm polite but clearly not interested. Everything in general is getting weird at Deathcake's house

Now, But a few times I noticed whenever he pulled her aside sometimes he would look directly at me while he spoke with her. Okay, BarfQueen, stop being so paranoid.

Deathcake brings out what she calls ""herbal"" tea. God damn

Next day I wake up in my living room. I figured we must of had some drinks or something like old times. Got carried away. They drop me off and I let myself in

The day after that I started getting messages on AIM from someone I never remembered talking to. He was very nice and kept referring to himself as my secret admirer. Mind you at this point I still really didn't remember anything from that night.

So this guy keeps messaging me saying really nice things to me. I was actually kind of flattered. Three or four days after that night at Deathcake's house

There

Now before anyone judges me for not immediately going to the authorities

Instead

And just when you thought this is going to be a simple date rape story it gets that much crazier.

Snow leave me alone for another few days. Then I get a text message from a number I've never seen before. 

""I love you""

Now who the fuck would send me that? I figured just leave it alone don't reply.

""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""What we have is special""

All I can think at this point is ""nope!"" Still I'm hoping he will eventually wear himself out and forget about me. 

Now I have blocked his instant message account

Then a picture of a rope.

Another rope.

I'm sure you can imagine the bricks that I shat when I realized he was quoting my pant size. Then all of a sudden something cracked in my head and I went full out berserk via instant message. I told him to leave me alone and that we'd never be together, which I just ignored until he stopped. Once he stopped, he never contacted me again. 

I heard three days later from one of the people who was there that night that he had killed himself. 

A few months later the same person told me that he attempted to kill himself but survived the attempt and was now in an inpatient facility. 

This same source also told me that once he got out he was coming for me. 

This is the part that I had mentioned earlier, and Had a history of terrorizing people in our high school. Who honestly knows what actually happened to Snow? I certainly don't. I haven't heard from him or about him from anyone since. 

These days I'm a lot less terrified. I'm almost 22 now

In the summer of 1998, so I was basically raised listening to bizarre and salacious stories of human sexuality and deviancy. At 11,  I was just beginning to contextualize all these words, like ""horny"" and ""bukkake"" (haha, no, the latter came later. No pun intended!). I wasn't sheltered, but I wasn't overexposed either

That day, safe spot for us tender young girls to stay while the moms went to Bloomingdale's. Not today.

So, oblivious to anyone else in the shop. We met in the middle, by this huge display of candy, looking at all the fancy pens. Suddenly, we both became aware of a large, chubby, HAIRY middle -aged man in the store with us. It didn't-HE didn't seem right. He didn't look like a dad. He didn't look like he was shopping for someone at all. He looked like he was on the prowl. 

He was wearing grotesquely tight bike shorts, and we were standing at the front of the middle aisle. He sauntered about halfway up the aisle, and then abruptly squatted as though he were looking at something on a low shelf. Suddenly, his monstrous-looking cock sprang out of his shorts. It was thick and purple- almost angry looking- and so fully exposed that his wrinkled scrotum almost touched the pink carpet.

This was the first full grown cock I'd ever seen. And it was terrifying. The man was leering at us menacingly and he spread his knees wide, and ran!

We found our moms and told them what had happened with that creep

Well

So, I normally calm down from these things by going outside to my driveway, sitting in the boat we have parked out there and looking at the stars. I can do this for hours: if you've ever seen a Texas night sky in the country, you'll understand why.

Anyways, no lights on, with the garage open at my back. It had rained earlier in the morning that day, but that had cleared up in the evening, so now the air was thick with humidity, and sweet, and exactly how I like it. 

Anyways, finally having calmed down and rationalized after the fight. And then a noise comes out of the darkness, right behind me.

You know that noise that barefeet make on concrete? That weird slapping noise that you can just identify from memories of 17 summers running across concrete with no shoes? Right. I heard that noise, but the houses aren't too close together, and there are no streetlights.

Anyways. 
My heart stopped , someone was behind me, with barefeet in my driveway. And the only thing behind me was my garage, so whoever it was, they'd been in my garage. 

Then it hit me. I'd been out here for hours. I hadn't heard a damned thing, watching me, waiting....for what?

I couldn't breathe. I remember the stars above me blurring into weird pinpricks of light because of the tears I was fighting back. I couldn't move because I didn't want them to know I heard them. At this point, I  had heard a cat, something, anything...Or maybe it was just my sisters? That's it, it's my sisters, they are trying to fuck with me! That must be it!

I began to really believe that, because something in my body knew that idea wasn't right. 

And then it happened again, this made me snap.

I jerked myself around, instead of an 18 or 15 year old girl, a man was standing there. Or rather, the silhouette. And this man was tall, easily over 6'4. (I hung out with basketball guys and got to judge height pretty well) 

At first, something dark and menacing and my heart just stopped again. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't do anything but stare into his shadowed face and somewhere deep inside me I felt some part of me shrivel up and choke. 

He moved suddenly, running down the side of my house, and I'm just sitting in this stupid boat in the middle of my driveway in the dark screaming my stupid little head off.

My sisters came out after a few minutes and laughed at me

I'll never forget the look of horror on my sister's faces as they shined the flashlight into the mud on the side of the house and found large footprints

To this day I still don't know why this guy was in my garage, or what made him run away. 

Needless to say

We started dating, attempting to get his undergrad degree at 28 in music while supporting himself. I felt sorry for him in a lot of ways; he'd been raised by a single mom who never gave him the love and stability he needed. He had pretty severe ADHD and had dropped out of school after repeating the 9th grade twice. He'd had a really rough start, and was fairly emotionally immature for a 28 year old. I had never spent so much time with someone and given them so much of myself, sexually, emotionally, and mentally. He was basically a wreck in a lot of ways and I tried to help him as much as I could, being an 18 year old at the time

We dated for about 8 months, possessive, and protective he became. He needed constant reminders that I was interested in him, and questioned every interaction I had with other men. For example, I had a close friend that lived in his neighborhood and I walked to his house from my ex's one day. Thinking that I had been gone too long and was most likely having sex with this other guy, my ex literally runs down the street and bursts in the door of my friend's house, out of breath and demanding to know what's going on. For some reason, at least for a little while. We had great sex

It wasn't until he flunked out of college and was faced with having to move back in with his grandmother that I finally threw in the towel. I felt it was getting too intense and didn't want to keep dating him anymore. My parents hated him and he had creeped out most of my friends at this point. But of course it was hard for me to let go, the sex was great and hard to leave. He seemed so pitiful after I broke it off, showing up at mutual friends' houses while I was there, texting me sad things, etc. It was hard to distance myself. We had sex a few times, and then I finally cut it off. 

This is when the creepiness begin to really set in. I had moved back in with my parents, bouquets of flowers, cards, weed (we were stoners), etc, left as gifts. He texted me constantly, drove past my house at night to check if I was there. If I wasn't he would call incessantly until I answered; if I didn't he would leave nasty voicemails.

I started casually seeing another guy, how could I break his heart, etc. My friend's roommate went outside and subdued him and he eventually went away.

A few nights later, etc. My managers escorted him out and told me he was banned from coming in there again. When I clocked off I had someone walk out with me, but when I got to my car he had keyed the shit out of it. There were lines up and down the sides of the car and he had scratched the word ""slut"" into the windshields and rearview mirrors. It was extremely upsetting and embarrassing. Of course I went home and told my parents about it. My dad is a criminal defense lawyer and called up some cop aquaintance of his and asked him to go talk to my ex. For some reason it was like there was nothing the cops could do about it except ask him to stay away from me. However, the abusive texts and hateful voicemails didn't stop; they got worse. The phone company couldn't block him from sending me messages, apparently. He hacked my Facebook. It was getting unbearable.

Being 19 and still stupid, but it became it an argument quickly. He told me he had cheated on me with a mutual aquaintance while we were together and had contracted herpes, and given it to me. I slapped him, and he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the ground and proceeded to try and choke me out. I just remember pulling his hair as hard as I could, screaming and biting, and finally squirming away and running out the door. He ran after me and I got in my car and locked the door. It was so scary seeing him pull on my car door, crying and screaming at me

I whipped around but by the time I got to her, I scream for my mom and take off in her direction, running as fast as I can, barefoot in the cold wet grass. I finally see her, and he's dragging her backwards and her feet are dangling behind her. 

I've never ran so fast. I run, and yank her away from him, and see his car parked down the road- engine still running. Rachel breaks free from us both, and I scream something along the lines of ""CALL THE POLICE, JESUS CHRIST SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE"" 

At that exact moment I made eye contact with Brian. The last words we exchanged crossed my mind... ""You're going to prison."" and ""I'm going to fucking kill you."" I felt pure terror... but a wave of determination. In that moment he sprinted after Rachel, but it was so much bigger than that.

I reached Rachel first, trying to grab my hair- which I had cut, nice try- as I desperately evaded his grabs at me and Rachel, running backwards towards the house. Rachel was mumbling to herself and bawling- ""I want to go I want to go"" and not quite understanding what was happening. In her mind, her daddy was just visiting her and we were having an argument. But I had this sinking feeling if I let her go, I wouldn't see her again.

I tripped, shouting at him to leave her alone. He looked hurt, but he wasn't stopping. Rachel took off running to the house, and I quickly squirmed to try and trip Brian to give her a few precious seconds. She got away, inside, and slammed the door on him. I ran around to the front door, where my mom was on the phone calling the police. 

Within the 5 minutes it took for them to get there, ""I just wanted to see my daughter before she left. Now they're lying and saying that I tried to kidnap her."" The policemen believed him, but told him to stay away as we had a large trip to go on in the morning, but allowed him to walk inside to say goodnight to Rachel. 

In addition,"" stared right at me, and left. He will never change. 

He's still out there, too. I don't know how he found out. But this needs to end.

EDIT: Now a message from Brian himself

""Judge ordered:
no contact to chelsea ****** only
cannot reside at residence
I have been away from home for three weeks and two days. Chelsea is homeschooled and I am her legal teacher, cooking, take them to church and activities. It has been a burden on all of us. I have been counseling for months with many pastors, elders, counselors, and outside professionals as to this situation and the stress it has caused. I have sought advise repeatedly with Maria *** the head of Dept of Child and Family investigation division Head of **** County for many months as to handle all situations legally.
My daughter Chelsea had a speech impediment therefore we homeschooled her for years,then as her best fried died from an eating disorder she recovered but remained disturbed. Her activities at church helped including singing at the church. Her band leader 22 year old male was giving her rides to and from church, then it became times other than church and was accused by the pastors as having an inappropriate relationship with her and demanded that he not text, talk or give her rides. She became very upset with this and threatened Brian her father she would lie and get him kicked off the youth leadership at church and put him in jail for controlling her or telling her what to do.  

**((NOTE: In Florida
She became repeatedly violent and verbally abusive to the whole family causing much stress to everyone.
When she was out of the house everything was peaceful but upon returning home she was spiteful and physically violent with all family members
In Counseling with her Youth Pastor and close personal friend of Brian
to meet with the Pastor. Because she stated there had been in the past issues he was forced by law to 
call child services. Agent Carmen ***** interviewed the family once in April. She said and said she would contact in thirty days. After that the Pastors asked Chelsea to step down and started the counseling with Brian and Chelsea separately. 
May 15, who had gone into the room, for his laptop because he had been working there earlier due to the fact that they share it as an office and a bedroom for Chelsea. She was not responding so he opened the locked door with a table knife and set it down then proceeded to enter and pick up the computer. 

He picked up the computer and bent over to unplug it and contact was made from Chelsea with yelling. As he turned and headed for the door there was contact but only to get out of the room. He says there was no intent to harm, but if he shoved her it was illegal. Brian said he was just trying to leave the room , protect his friends laptop and get work done. After leaving the bedroom directly he was sitting in the living room with the younger daughter on his lap, Chelsea proceeded to come into the living room and throw candy at Brians face and accuse him of eating some. **He then stood up and Chelsea punched him in the face then spit in his face.** She then stormed off to her room and called the police.
Carmen **** from protective services recommended counseling from everyone involved. Brian has been in continued counseling thru the church but Chelly and Chelsea are reportedly seeking alternate counseling at this time. ""

1356899592.0,15oqh6,"""Meggan""",Me_without_You,221,55,90,"I met this girl through an old friend I grew up with, and easy to get along with. A few short weeks after meeting her

To shorten the story a tad, I was dating Cam. Shortly after we met, both of us couples broke up. Since I had grown up with the boys I was obviously still friends with them. She , on the other hand, wanted nothing to do with them. I thought. 

Fast forward about 2 months, Allysa, online and through text a few times before. She seemed pretty nice but I wondered why we hadn't met in person. She is the one that told me to ask Meggan out since she knew I liked her. Oddly, she didn't actually have a phone and the texting she did was through Yahoo IM. 

I introduced Meggan to my other friends at the time and they all seemed to like her well enough. I also found out more about her as time passed, and apparently her dad was a ""molester"" and her mom was a crackhead. I met her mom and honestly she didn't seem like she was a crackhead at all. She was average build, had a decent home, and was a teacher for an alternative school. I wasn't one to question though. None of my business. 

As our relationship grew...so did drama. First, and was at the hospital alone. She said it was Mikey's baby. Oddly, she didn't call me to come help her even though we both lived a couple blocks from the hospital. I didn't even hear about it until late that night after trying to get ahold of either her or Allysa. Finally, Allysa ""texts"" me and tells me what happened and to just let Meggan be until the next day. So, I did what any good girlfriend would do, and I went to check on her and see if she needed anything. I just wanted her to know I cared. Allysa lived out of town and since Meggan's mom was a crackhead...I figured she needed someone. Nope. She wouldn't talk to me or even open the door. 

The next couple of days, nothing. So, I finally start getting more worried/upset. She starts talking to me and things start to smooth out. I forgot to mention that Meggan was obsessed with her computer. Just about everytime she and I were hanging out we had our computers right there with us. 

About a week goes by

I tried to take care of her the best I could but she wouldn't tell me what was going on so I tried to give her space. I was also a little upset with her too

Things smooth out again. We are at my best friend's house and all of a sudden she doesn't feel good. Said she needed sugar tablets or something. I rush myself and my buddy to the store to get her some.  I spent my last $20 on tablets

One day Meggan tells me she went to the doctor and they told her that if she doesn't get a bone marrow transplant that she probably doesn't have that much longer. The next day is her birthday and her mom lets us come over and drink. Meggan had asked me before not to bring up the bone marrow thing in front of her mom cause it made her really depressed. Well

A couple weeks go by and Meggan is being more and more stand offish. I thought I did something wrong. So

A few days later

Another random day, I asked her not to talk to him anymore. 

About a month later

A week passes and I am at work when Meggan calls telling me she wants me to meet her at the air port to say goodbye. My boss

She leaves and Chris and I walk out to the parking lot. I had problems with him since he had tried to touch my girlfriend but she forgave him so I let it go. As we sit down and light up a cigarette he asks how long Meggan and I had been friends. I looked at him confused and said ""We've been dating for about 6-7 months now"". He had no idea. I asked him if he had ever seen me before because I thought I knew him. We finally realize that he is the guy we used to call ""Jesus"" at my friends house. He supplied their weed. We get to talking and he tells me about when he helped her with her car. Apparently

I go home and tell my mom. I start thinking about it all and how odd everything is. Nothing ever fit into place but I never asked questions. Now I wanted answers. I waited a couple days and she finally texts me from Arizona. Says she is having another miscarriage. It was from when she was ""raped"". All I ask is what hospital she is in. She says she is in a walk in clinic. 

Now

I tell her this and she gets pissed and argues with me. Then she won't talk to me anymore. I start getting more and more mean, I have enough and I drive to her house. Thankfully, her mom was there. She answers the door with a sad look on her face. I ask if we can talk a minute. She lets me in and we have a seat. I think her name was Brenda or something. 

Brenda: ""What's on your mind? Is it Meggan?""
I hesitate...""It's okay..What has she done now?""

Me: ""Well

Brenda: ""Wow, she doesn't. What else is there?""

Me: ""She's not hypoglocemic is she?"" (Nope) ""You're not really a crackhead are you?"" 

Brenda: ""That one really hurts but I have heard it before. No

Me: ""Have you ever met Allysa or Skylar? They seem to be a little crazy""

Brenda: ""Well

(HOLY SHIT)

Me: ""Umm..what? So she has been sending me all these mean texts
 (Duh)

Well

There is a lot more to the story. I don't know if anyone cares to hear it but I really don't have anymore time for it today. Just one thing

One night we went for a walk. Well

Just as we entered the lot, but the lights on the front of the school meant I could see the car pretty clearly. It was navy blue and it's back windows were tinted dark. There were no decals or anything on it, nothing that said ""security"" or ""neighborhood watch"".

The driver was a Caucasian man, no uniform. He rolled down his window and spoke to me:
""Hey! You're not allowed to be here. You're trespassing.""

I was confused. I stopped walking and took a small step towards the car to hear him better. ""Pardon me?""

""I'm going to have to take you downtown. Get in the car."" 

Now, firm voice said I said ""No."" The driver looked confused at that. I glanced  toward the end of the parking lot- Eric and Collin had seen the car and were skating back quickly.

He tried again. ""You're in a lot of trouble. *Get in the car!*""

""No!"" At that moment Collin and Eric reached me. I think one of them asked the driver who he was. The guy didn't say anything else

1341805967.0,w9535,Always Lock The Door,roby6907,201,32,44,"Hey guys

This story is from when I was about 9 or 10 years old, but my brother was away at a sleepaway camp, leaving just my parents and I at home.

One night, but my dad saw through her act and brought her to the hospital at around 7 at night. It ended up being appendicitis, so it turned out to be a pretty good move by him. Obviously, they left pretty quickly, so I was stuck home by myself for the night until my dad returned. My parents had always been strict about the amount of time I spent playing video games and watching TV, so I naturally went straight to our basement to the gamecube and started playing Super Smash Bros Melee.

Quickly, there was only about 15 feet of space before the fence and behind there was an even steeper hill.

As a kid, I kept glancing towards the window and thinking I saw some movement. Of course, I lived in a suburban area so there were many different animals that would run around outside, but not usually during the night. And since I was paranoid, it only took a bit of movement to get my attention, whether it was an animal or not. I was much too scared to actually go to the window or go outside to see what it was, so I decided to just go upstairs to the living room and watch TV.

I climbed the stairs still a bit shaken up from what I thought I had seen. I figured I would feel better in our living room though since the window in that room was also in the back of the house

It was about 9 at this point and I was getting hungry since I hadn't actually eaten dinner yet. At a commercial break, quickly locked the door, and continued to the kitchen. I grabbed some food and went back to the living room to watch TV again.

Just as I sat down on the couch and put my food down on the table

Someone was trying to open the door.

I froze for a minute, it stopped moving. Whoever was trying to open it had given up. Then, for some reason, I decided to run to the kitchen window and look outside to try to catch a glimpse of the person who had been trying to enter my home. I didn't get a good look, but I did see a man dressed in all black run away from the front steps to my house and down the street towards the woods. Something else caught my eye though; something the man was holding reflected the light from the streetlamp.

It was a knife.

Just always remember to lock the door at night.

I was eight years old when I moved from N. California to S. California. My recently divorced mother and I started our journey by staying with my mom's sister and her husband as well as their toddler child. My mom and I stayed in a room together in their home.Things were going pretty well at first


I remember waking up in the middle of the night next to my mom and my aunt's husband was in the room. I didn't know what to think of it as a kid and simply dismissed it. He sat me down one time

It became apparent that my aunt's husband was in love with my mother. My mother refused him completely

Eventually, he physically assaulted her by grabbing her wrist and slapping her in the face. A coworker of hers heard some hub-bub and diffused the situation and he left.

My mom told me to stay away from him. One day at school (4th grade, but I went along with him anyways. Then I noticed we weren't even going remotely towards my house. We were parking in a Target parking lot and he called my mom on his cell. He told her that he had me and that he wouldn't let me go until she came down to talk to him. I sat there, ashamed of being played. She came and my uncle shoved me out of the car and she made me march to hers while they talked and argued. At this point, my mom came back to the car and broke down asking why this was happening.

My aunt finally got into the picture and it was time for him, he followed behind her and put a gun to her head. She begged and pleaded, saying ""I have a daughter, please don't do this"". He backed off and that was the end of that horrible night.

There were a couple nights where we had to stay at motels to keep away from him banging on our doors. The moment I mostly remember.. My mom pulled me out of school early, locked every single door and ran upstairs. From the window in her room, we can see the pathway leading towards our house. We watched him get out of his car and start walking towards our door, a large kitchen knife in hand. I was crying so hard while my mom was embracing me, crying as well. She was on the phone with the cops, yelling out the window that she had done so and after 10 minutes he ran off. Later on we heard that they had gone to his house and arrested him.

So after all this bullshit ended, she's still with the bastard. Most likely for financial purposes, but still.. really?They're still together, my mom and I are fine (of course with a restraining order) and haven't seen him since then (and they live 30 minutes away..)

So it was a friends 21st birthday and I had agreed to meet him for a couple drinks.  I was, cause I was, when the oppisite emerges from the shadows of the club.  This guy was a large black man. Probably a few years my senior, did not seem unpleasant and I wasn't one to jump to conclusions over race.  She introduced us and mentioned they had just met that night.  We decided to get some beer and find a place to drink.  A little strange that neither one of themm recommended we go to a house or somewhere more public but I go along with it.  We split on a case and head to a secluded park.  At this point everthing was still fine but I made sure to choose the location because I knew the area and they did not.  If shit went down I had the upper-hand.  Behind this park ran some railroad tracks and it was a typical area for ""kids"" to drink/smoke etc.  Everything started out fine, though by this point my attention turned away from entertaining her and to the fact that this situation was just odd.  Why would they agree to come with me to such a secluded area?  This is not where sorrority girls kick it but she didn't seem to mind.  Rather she seemed to be having fun and he became a little focused on me.  I won't lie, at some point I thought maybe I was *his* sexual target.  Either way, things just felt off.  He excused himself to back to her car, asking ""What's wrong"", she says  ""I know that's why you brought me here, still sobbing

1370458737.0,1fqlrv,*I* Was the Creeper: Another perspective,tameimpalea,203,38,33,"I have never considered sharing my own story on account of this thread being predominantly about experiences *of*


Last August I had begun classes at a new university and had leased an apartment with 3 other girls, but I was ecstatic that life was finally going smoothly for me.  Sure, I was abusing my prescribed adderall and smoking weed a little too much, but people liked me!  My teachers liked me!  I was making good grades!  I was losing weight(thanks to the adderall)!  Finally, stability!  The stability didn't last long, however, and November was when the first incident began.

It was a Friday, and there was excessive banging upstairs.  However, with the banging I began to hear muffled voices.  There were two: a male and a female.  The male voice was menacing and condescending, making the female voice cry and beg him to be quiet.  It only escalated after that, disturbing me greatly.  I tried to play music to cancel out the sound, but I couldn't shake what I had heard.  ""Someone is being abused up there"", I thought.

After some internal debate I decided to go upstairs and knock on the door, that I heard banging and upset voices from my room.   They were accommodating and pleasant to my concern, and assured me that there was nothing going on.  I was skeptical of course, but acquiesced to their assurance and went back to my apartment, but not until I checked the third floor above me, just for good measure.  It was late at night now, and I still heard the voices.  I was confused, and worried about what I was hearing, saying that domestic violence was heavily underreported.  He told me he had checked numerous apartments above me and there was no clues of potential abuse

I guess I took his request to call if I heard anything else a little too seriously, and called 911 again.  The same policeman came back and knocked on my door again, and again assured me there was noting amiss, and gave me his personal cellphone number if I heard anything else.  At the time I saw it as an act of kindness and genuine concern, but now I see it as not so much that as it was an attempt to get me to stop calling 911.  The abusive voices never stopped that night, and I couldn't sleep in fear and despair.

I want to make it clear that I have no history with domestic abuse or sexual abuse of any kind.  Yet this fact did not stop what I was hearing.  I tried to ignore it for a few nights, and again went to the apartment upstairs, practically begging them this time to please be quiet, I had a test I needed to study.  They weren't as accommodating as before, and understandably were exasperated with this random girl that claimed to hear abusive voices in their apartment.  ""Have you watched any movies lately?"" They asked, and I left in a huff, starting to think that they were purposely keeping something from me.  

The voices became louder; I could hear them from outside the apartment now, looking into any windows I could, and even went into an apartment that had a partially opened door to look around and see if the voices got any louder from the inside of it.  I was at this point manic.  ""Help me!""  I heard the female voice wail over and over again, and the male voice repeating, ""Do you love me?  Do you love me?  Do you love me?  Do you love me?""

I called the police again, claiming that the neighbors above me had gotten a doll with blood smeared on it at their doorstep.  Now this I did not do.  They of course did not believe a word that I said at this point, and looked around the apartment(from the front hallway) for ""crafting supplies"" and even asked my roommates if they saw me as a crafty person.  They finally left after now initial evidence, but not before giving me a card to a mental health ward and encouraging me to come with them for a mental evaluation.  I was insulted, not so much with their suggestion but their insistence, and closed the door swiftly behind them.

The next day I went to the front desk to ask if there were any people in the building with the names of ""Jacob"" or ""Kelly""

I learned to ignore what I heard, smoking more and popping more adderall.  I later found out that it was a friend of the neighbors who did the doll as a joke, oblivious to what they were dealing with at the same time.

I truly wish the story ended there, very likely scared one of my roommates out of the apartment and lost any remaining respect I had with my other roommates.  I don't want to make this single post a novella, but will gladly write a part two if there is interest for it.

Across from us was the very old lady. We didn't pay much attention at first because we were preoccupied with our frosties and the movie (Cloud Atlas, amazing, maybe my favorite movie ever).

 She was quite plump, took out my knife and gave it to my girlfriend, just incase anything happens (I was much stronger than this woman, Im 6'6"" and 240lbs, but my girlfriend was not, so I'd rather her have the weapon).

1344437990.0,xvt4x,I thought he'd finally gone...,haaappy,197,28,34,"Hey everyone! I’m a sucker for scary stories and have been watching this place for months. Absolutely love it! I think it’s about time I contribute a story that still gives me the heebie jeebies to this day. I’m from England but this story took place a couple summers ago when I was working abroad in Ayia Napa

This one particular night, but I (used to) really enjoy walking around after dark. Now, if you’re a girl, as I am, you’ll know that walking around places like this, you get hassled A LOT by random men. It’s no biggie, they’re pretty much always harmless and over my time in Ayia Napa I built up quite a tolerance to it. The man who creeped on me this night, wasn’t the usual innocent sleaze. I was a bit drunk when this happened but I’m not sure being sober would have changed anything- creepers gonna creep!

So, even if someone's a blatant creep, I like to give people the benefit doubt and be trusting. There's no crime in saying hi to a stranger, in fact it's quite nice. On this occassion though, I just ignored it and hoped he'd notice the headphones because I was shattered, enjoying my beats and just really couldn't be bothered with it. I kept walking and heard the guy chuckle and say something like, “I’m only saying hello.” I thought to myself, don’t be rude and so I turned my head to say hi as I kept walking. Big mistake.

The problem is you can’t tell which ones will walk on after a hello and which ones will take even just a smile as an invitation to chat more. This guy did the latter. He trotted over and walked beside me asking me my name, although I didn’t tell him the exact name.

We’d been walking down the empty streets for about a minute and I started to worry that he would walk me the whole way home and find out where I stayed. I asked him where he lived and he told me the name of a hotel really near where I stayed. This was obviously a lie since he was definitely a local judging by his appearance

Fortunately, walking closer and closer to me and eventually putting his arm around me. I pushed it off, asking him not to do that and tried to put some distance between us. He chuckled and kept coming closer to me as we walked. I kept looking around for other people but the streets were dead. He tried again to put his arm round me and ran his hand down my back as I shrugged him off. I was getting angry and really scared by this point and jogged to the other side of the road telling him to stay away. He kept his distance but continued grinning and asking questions which I no longer responded to.

By this point we were about 40 feet from the turn-off for “his hotel” and about 80 from mine

I knew running would be futile because he was, ignoring the, “Hey baby, come on!” from behind me as he kept pace just a few steps behind. I reached my apartment but still didn’t want him to see exactly where I lived and definitely didn’t want him to follow me into the dark car park. I turned around and told him in the most aggressive voice I could manage to, “Go the fuck away!” but he just stood there 10 yards away looking kind of hurt/ angry. This guy was one persistent creep.

Looking back, scuffing his feet. Finally he got the picture, I thought, and I kept walking and hoped that if I just went round the block, he’d be gone by the time I got back. I took the first right after my apartment and silently sprinted the next three sides of the block. I peeked round the next corner at my apartment. I couldn’t see him and so walked into the car park... and he was fucking there in between two cars smirking at me. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever got such a fright in my life!! I don’t know how he knew that was where I lived- perhaps because it was a popular place for UK workers to stay… I don’t know. I screamed and ran for my door which I pounded with my fist. My friend answered the door as I was scrambling for my keys and I barged through slamming the door behind me. Her boyfriend was there which was a huge comfort and after seeing the look on my face he ran outside as I hurriedly told him what happened but the guy was gone.

I never saw him again but I made sure I never walked home alone after that. Perhaps he didn't intend to actually do anything to me but I don't understand why any guy in his right mind would do that when he must have known how much he freaked me out...?! Not cool.

This story has to do with a squatter originally from Wisconsin and I sat next to her on a greyhound bus to Huntington West Virginia.
To begin, both of these seats are taken. She didn't get the hint. I could literally smell her from where she was standing and there was no way in hell I was going to sit next to that for the next ten hours ... or so I thought. She decided to make a bee line straight towards me and plopped down, odor and all. She didn't even have enough courtesy to ask if it was taken or if she was bothering me. I was so pissed off; she could have taken the seat right across from me but I figured she wanted someone to talk to on the way down. I'm usually the nicest girl you'd ever meet but I don't fair well with people who have no manners, such as the new arrival. She began to introduce herself and I could see the dirt encrusted under her fingernails and what seemed like dried up blood around her lips. I was mortified!
I couldn't bring myself to shake her hand but I did say hello. I believe her name was Anna something, used meth, coke and became pregnant and that's why she was ""on the run"". The whole thing sounded weird. Why was she on the run? That's the only question running through my head when I start feeling the stabbing pains in my stomach from not eating breakfast before leaving. Honestly, I forgot about her long enough to reach into my bag and pull out a little bag of chips, in which I saw her gawking at. I felt horrible and decided to share them with her, even though the events of my trip were going to take a drastic turn. She polished off my whole bag and fell asleep, I, noticed a very peculiar gash in her neck. Why the hell was there a cut that size circling half her neck and why didn't I notice when she sat down. That's when I saw the handle of something in her bag. I didn't know what it was and my imagination ran wild. About thirty minutes later we arrived in Zanesville
Here I am sitting next to a homeless pregnant woman and she has a knife and gashes on her body. She didn't seem to right in the head as was; I started thinking about where she could have possibly gotten the money to ride the bus at all and everything clicked. Needless to say, I was paranoid but for good reason; I then hear the woman mumbling in her sleep and what I heard next I'll never forget. ""She'll die!"" I had just about enough and knew the homeless addict wasn't pregnant. She was insane! I got off the bus in Columbus and made my way towards my next destination and could see that the woman was running to the exit when security had stopped her. I, being nosey, got close enough to hear the conversation. Someone had called the police over her doing something before she left Pittsburgh. Via stabbing a man and taking his wallet. It was probably the person she had stabbed and once again, everything clicked. The gash around her neck was him fighting back and the blade was the weapon she used to take that mans wallet to pay for a ticket out of there. I knew something wasn't right the minute she told me her story. Police showed up and carted her away while I watched. My only thoughts at the time were that I could have been next. When I reached my destination I flipped on the tv at my mothers house to see if anything showed up on the news about it. Nothing. During my whole vacation, not once was it mentioned. I even went on the web to see if Pittsburgh news had reported about it, all efforts were useless.

**Women! If you go out at night, at LEAST make sure you check in with her, and offer to come out/give her a ride, if she feels she needs it.** 

A couple of years ago (as of June 28th, except for the back side of the plaza. During the day, it's just a post office and a crap-ton of dumpsters. At night, it is a secluded, dark, creepy place that begs for something bad to happen.

In the are I live, who have grown up in the area.) The city I live in, and the one this story take place, are the center of everything. The upper-middle class white families take stage here. Nothing to do for the teens besides go to school, walk to Del Taco, and go to the movies. In the cities surrounding, you have the 55+ in country clubs sharing space with the ghetto, you have a typical Southern California community.

On this particular night, strapless summer dress (this detail will be important.)  We did our usual movie, and a few laps around the plaza. The other two are picked up, and I am left to wait alone. I walk around, not feeling any danger, (I've been there a thousand times, alone

As I walk around, not an unusual sight in the area) but don't give it much thought. As I finish another lap and come near the end of the plaza, where the post-office starts up, I see the druggy standing against the wall. As I get closer, he stands straight to do, what I assumed, was to ask for a light (at the time, who didn't do drugs or anything, until he dug his nails into my arm. I was ready to kick him in the nads and scream

I am frozen in fear. Unsure of what to do. I tries to make a sound, but to no avail. We walk about 50 feet around a corner, almost past the post office, until he turns me down an alley. This is the area with all the dumpsters that is almost pitch black, with the exception of a dim glow from the street lights next to the post office. I am horrified and fear this is where I will die. But no. What happens next makes me wish it were.

I see him reach for the gun and pull it all the way out, more of a pushing the gun I'm to my collar bone.)

I feel one shakey, until he presses the gun harder into my stomach. I put my hands over my face and begin to sob, as I ease my legs enough for him to do what he wanted. I don't look at him for the rest of this encounter, but I feel everything. He moves the gun away, I assume he set it down next to him. I then feel him pry my legs apart... Line up and penetrate me. I didn't know then if he did or did not wear a condom (today I know he did, because I've had other sexual encounters) and was in a great deal of pain. I was a virgin then, and though he didn't ""pop my cherry"" he still caused me an immense amount of pain. 

I know it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes from the point of him grabbing me

I assume he finished, pull up his pants, grab the gun and scuttle off. I lay in shock and tears there until I hear my cell phone ring. It's my dad. He's infront of the theatre waiting for me... I don't remember it, but I had gotten myself up and walked all the way to the car. I didn't say a word to my father, and I feel he assumed I just had a fight with a friend, or was tired. Or just being a teen girl and not talking. But when we got home, I couldn't even get myself to shower. I just went to bed and sobbed into my pillow. I stayed in my room for almost a week. I didn't speak to anyone

To this day, he had done enough by hurting me.

It might be kind of lame and way too long but it scared me through most of my teen years and contributed heavily to my gun phobia

So there was a guy named Ricky who went to the same school as me for as long as I can remember. I didn't know him

One day in seventh grade we had an assembly in the cafeteria, I didn't know him, but I had an empty seat by me and waved him over to let him know. He sat down and said ""Thanks, (my name)"" with sad and grateful eyes. I said, ""No problem,"" and turned back to my friends, kind of wondering when I told him my name.

After that he tried to talk to me a lot, because they knew he was going to come sit with us. They complained to me about it, because he really was annoying and the kind of awkward that is just hard to hold a conversation with... I didn't enjoy being around him either, because he just made things uncomfortable. I started cutting our interactions short and trying to keep an air of mere acquaintanceship, hoping he would get the hint and go find other people to hang around. It worked, mildly.

He stopped sitting with us but he still would stare at me or try to interact with me alone, can I talk to you for a minute?"" Sarah gave me a look and left. I said, ""Okay, but class is about to start."" Then he says, with a very serious face, ""I love you. Will you marry me?"" I got pissed that someone I barely even knew would put me in that kind of situation and demanded, ""What? What the fuck?"" He responded, after that point I was no longer tolerant of him and was as cold as possible. He didn't like that.

Some time later, ""Ugh, somebody just kill me,"" and put her face down on her desk. Later in the day, Ricky showed her a comic he had drawn depicting Sarah exclaiming, and in the following panels, Ricky pulling a gun and shooting her in the head. She came to me later with an appropriately ""what the fuck"" reaction (I mean, but I think it's even more so when the receiver knowingly suffers from depression as Sarah did.) We agreed that we should get the drawing and show it to a teacher. However

We ignored him completely after that. For weeks if he tried to speak to us, laughing to give ourselves something to do besides counting down the days until summer vacation.

Ricky walked into the room as we were laughing and, ""You won't be laughing when I have a gun in your face."" I was startled but had the curse of ""fake badass 'til you make badass"" and spat back without thinking, ""Yes I will, see you in hell, asshole."" He continued on his way and Sarah and I looked at each other, wide-eyed. We knew we should have reported him, but for some reason we were afraid and never did.

Fast forward to ninth grade, but felt it was too late. So every day I went to gym class, I felt more and more afraid for my life. He had anger issues and years of being bullied, and I was scared that as his ""only friend who betrayed and abandoned him,"" he would hate me the most out of all of his aggressors. I started to have trouble sleeping and nightmares about dying, and went to school every morning wondering if this was the day I would die. One day I broke down in the car and told my mom everything, and how afraid I was to be around him. The next day I was called to the principal's office to make a statement. Soon he was moved out of all of our mutual classes

People who knew what happened eventually mentioned that he did the same thing to several other girls throughout high school who were nice enough to extend basic friendliness to him

One night however, and comes to the counter asking for his usual smokes. As I'm ringing him up, he suddenly starts talking. ""You know, I do the same shit everyday?

Greyhound Bus Story #1- The Stripper's Happy Family


This one isn't terribly scary, which I am.  She welcomes herself to sit with me and begins rambling on about her life and what she's doing there. 


At first I was kind of playing polite but not paying that much attention...until I started to notice how interesting her story actually was.  Apparently she was a stripper in Los Angeles and she got fired because the bouncer and her fell in love and refused to break up to keep their jobs.  She, glaring, black man standing next to her luggage across the way.  I'm like....'um...okay.'  Not really sure what I'm supposed to even say, just nodding and trying to be polite.


Then things got fun.  She asks me if I have any change, although he kept one eye on their luggage the entire time.  She also seems to have procured a large family photo album.


As we all start to eat she begins flipping through it and telling me about the photos.  This is not a normal family photo album.  The first picture is a picture of her and the bouncer boyfriend, but rolling around on the dance floor together, making out.  The next one was more graphic and included the bouncer.  She's telling me how this girl was like her sister, and how much she loved her.  Also, can I tell she's 5 months pregnant in this other picture?  The whole time I'm keeping a neutral face but on the inside I'm just tripping out over this couple.


The rest of the night wasn't terribly eventful, we left.  When I got off at my stop however, the woman yelled out to me from her seat, ""May all your dreams come true, sweetheart!!""  and I couldn't help shouting, ""You too!"" on my way out.


Overall review:  Nice couple


Greyhound Bus Story #2-Touchy McToucherson


  The usual, but I managed to get a seat to myself....at least, until the bus pulled into a small stop along the way and five more people got on.  Unlike most creeper stories, this guy didn't single me out in an empty bus...there really were no other seats but mine, so while I'm not super happy I'm not really alert either.  I took my usual ""I don't want to interact"" stance, leaned against the window, with my walkman in hand.  The guy didn't really say or do anything...he was wearing a large, and his face didn't have anything about it that was particularly memorable.  Long story short


I think I only slept for 15 minutes or so,shoved the guys arm back and glared.  I have no idea why I didn't yell or alert others, but I didn't.  The guy seemed to have been spooked by my sudden hostility, and put his head back down.  


Then he started slowly scooting over.  He did it very slow, which terrified me even more.  I started scanning the crowd around me, trying to see if anybody nearby sees what is happening or could help me...everyone is facing forward, oblivious, except for one girl.  She was sitting one seat back, and across from me and she was watching everything.  We made eye contact and I tried my best at making the teenager, wide-eyed 'heeeeelp meeeee' face.


Just then the bus pulled in to another stop and a few people got out, like he knew I was thinking of getting up and bolting.  Just then the girl from behind me pops up right behind the guy and says loudly, ""OH MY GOD!!!  Finally I can sit with my friend!!  What kind of a crappy bus system is this, we haven't been able to sit together since we first left!  Come on, girl!!"" as she grabs my arms and actually jerks me pretty hard past the guy and into the empty seat with her.


I thanked her, for which I was eternally grateful.  Ick.

After he found out I was unemployed he jumped at the chance to offer me a job

him: Just come with me to the front desk so I can book the suite?

I couldn't find the address he wanted me to find so he told me to meet him at a nearby shopping centre where he got me to jump in his car and took me to the display home.

him: I bet you really wanted that 3some aye? Come look at this porno site! You look so sexy right now getting my dick so hard!

Me: THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE! I have a bf! I want to go home

He looked angry and started trying to CONVINCE me to touch him and started chasing me around the dinner table laughing (not happy laughter). My bf called and so I ran outside

I told my boyfriend what happened and he sent an email to the head of the guys company asking if my 'interview' was actually legit and telling him what happened

I went home, and how I could feel my bones everywhere I touched when I moved and shuffled to try and get out of his reach.

I was always cold. Skinny doesn't matter when you have to pile on clothing layers. This was summer

In September, and I had no energy to fight back when he would hold me down and spit on me and do the weekly- antagonizing.  I'm ashamed to say none of my friends saw how deathly I was becoming. There was very little fat on my body. 
Cyndi... was worse. She began to grow tufts of hair on her skin to keep her warm, with a whole week before that. Her body was shutting down. 

I remember her bragging about how she had less than 5% bodyfat

Self harm was fluent with both of us... whether it be laxative abuse (My record was 90 blue laxatives in one night, usually)
or simply slicing parts of our bodies.

My worst memory is my dad banging on my door, for some reason I didn't want to die.) slicing it until it looked like a barcode, where I still have scars, and just sobbing, thinking of all of my friends from the library and more who didn't know this was happening, who went home and ate dinner and went to bed and thought about boys.

Brian had let me go out to eat with friends on a Wednesday night, ""You can do it, hold strong. Just binge it out."" I remember her texting me, ""I'm starving. I might binge again."" and then my phone dying.

I go home that night, over 10 texts.. I go through them while my phone charges. ""Chelsea, where are you?"" ""Dude I feel really sick. I ate a lot, it's going to take at least a month to put off this weight."" ""Holy shit I feel really sick."" and then the calls began- 

""Chelsea

And finally
""Chelsea

Cyndi died that night

I knew, panicking. After 4 hours with no reply, (I woke up around 4pm) her mom called me.

The moment she said the words I was fearing, and just screamed. I screamed for ten whole minutes, eyes sobbing- I'm crying right now typing this- that it was my fault. I wasn't there. My mom and Brian rushed to me, and the moment I wailed out ""Cyndi IS DEAD"" Brian took my phone and spoke to Cyndi's mother, then dragged me into the car, and drove me to the beach for some reason, while I hysterically sobbed.

The whole 2 hour ride there, ""Chelsea's friend just died. Yeaaah. I'm taking her to the beach overnight so she can relax. Yeah it's horrible. She was a sick girl though, it was a matter of time..."" Right in front of me. 

He even insulted her. ""She was an older girl. I was worried she was a bad influence on Chelsea. I heard she dropped out of school.""

And then finally, crying into it, I heard him from the beach. ""Cyndi was a bad kid. I expected this. She was really sick and I'm just happy it was her and not MY daughter.""

Fast forward. A year passes, have sleepovers every weekend, lots of friends. Never told them about Brian.

Brian does a lot of creepy things that year. He begins hitting on a 14 year old girl from my church

He also began to scare my friend Sam, that she deserves a more mature man.

Of course,or in just underwear, I should mention, under all of my sheets) I still made the best of my life, even though I was still forcibly homeschooled.

Eventually, plus excruciating detail on Brian's assaults. The pastor of course immediately said he'd contact child services to do an investigation, and that he was so sorry.

But someone tipped Brian off. Brian began to stop punching me, and looked at me I looked healthy. I told her the honest truth; he was a monster. She came back twice more, and told me as long as I had no bruises, there was no evidence, and that she was sorry.

Brian decided it was time for revenge. He had me kicked off of the church band on my 16th birthday- I was at a youth retreat

Brian did it. He had no job, he began the heavy beatings again. He had a tongue like a salesman. For someone as mentally ill as him, he could think of the most clever lies and excuses.

One night it was the worst. I was in my room,000 for my birthday, but he only gave me $20 of it and a used, clunky dell laptop) I beg for him to let me keep it, and he hears the lyric, ""White light, alcohol alcohol!"" come out of the laptop. He runs at me, and grabs me by my hair, with a chunk of hair being torn from my head, but his foot comes down on my chest

He begins to hoist me up by my hair and slaps me, you're autistic!"" before shoving me into a wall, further bruising my back. He picks me up and throws me back down so many times, my knees and elbows are bruised to purple, and there's blood streaming out of my leg where there's a gash. His favorite thing to do was punch my boobs; it hurt like agony, but it was his favorite move.
I tried fighting back,as he's now bored, curling on my bed and going to sleep.

I go to church the next night. I have a black eye, desperate for someone to see the bruises and cuts. 

I discovered nobody could stop him but me. I need a happy ending

It was a normal day, to school. I said bye to him, told him to have a good day and proceeded to turn back.
Taking my usual short-cut through an alley, quite short and had greasy, slicked back hair and was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and an equally as vile t-shirt. Whenever I'd slow down my pace, or speed it up, he would do the same. Quite creeped out, and being a paranoid person anyway, I got home and locked the doors behind me. Looking out of my window, staring at my house and not moving. I shrugged it off and continued with my day.

Fast-forward to later that night.

It was 11pm and I'd been speaking to my boyfriend, on the other side of the street, the man was still there, stood under a street light. He had something in his hand. I told Dean about this guy and how he's been standing outside for most of the day and he told me he'd come right over. When he parked up, he came in to check that I was fine and then went outside to confront this weird-ass guy. 

From my window, kick and stab Dean with what I can only assume was a knife. Dean, however, is 6''1, intimidating and is a brown belt in karate. He managed to pin down this guy, get the weapon off of him and restrain him long enough to call the police.

1362607314.0,19sw6f,And this is why I stopped wearing dresses.,Red1332,218,57,41,"Back in my late teens and early twenties I was going to college in Seattle and having the time of my life. Having grown up in a relatively conservative area

At the time of this story I was living with a boyfriend who kept weird hours as the desktop and server support guy for a small IT startup (it was the 90's and those were a dime a dozen in the Puget Sound.)

I found myself waiting for him to actually show up again on a strip of road known as The Ave near the University of Washington. Basically it was where the college kids filtered down to for cigarettes

Now, it was actually a gorgeous sunny day so I broke out the youthful uniform of the time, Doc Martens and a babydoll dress. I felt incredibly cute, and probably walked like it, too.

I was on the Ave for half an hour

He was fat, SPECTACLES, wire rims and everything, oooold old style glasses- and wearing a tie, white shirt, khaki pants... like he'd just stumbled out of an office building and landed in the sunshine.

I tried to ignore him because I really hate it when people stare at me and at the time I was somewhat meek about confrontation. But as we sat there, we made eye contact because of that, and he took a step towards me.

This freaked me out so I pushed down further

I crossed the street and noted with panic that the guy crossed the street as well. I couldn't figure out what the hell he could possibly want

Noting the bf was not, which had a very prominent sign stating NO LOITERING.

I was also a bit of a good-girl in those days

I immediately went to the back of the store and hid, then disappeared to the other side of the store.

as I couldn't see him at that point and was scared he would come up behind me from the back

At that point I decided I had enough weirdness to call the cops

And the guy looks at me like I'm an idiot and says ""Which guy?""

So I try to point him out as quietly as possible. The guy turns around, he pockets his wallet and disappears outside.

""Look, natural-born Seattlites just don't give a damn about your drama, even if it's legit.)

""Can I just stay in here until he gets on the bus

""He's just waiting for the bus

Then he turns and sees the guy trying to stare at me through the reflective glass and it occurs to him maybe he's wrong.

""You know what? Never fucking mind

For the next 45 minutes I circled down one side of the Ave and walked up the other

when I realized my bf might be stuck on a project all evening and unable to call me -this is pre-ubiquitous cell phones for people- and that this guy might be circling with me all afternoon

I took my position back up at my bus stop corner, then returned to staring at me.
I couldn't think of anything else at that point so I just turned around and started staring him down

He looked away, he pushed away from the wall and walked up to me with this thin little smile on his face.
""Beautiful day out

What the f***?? I thought.

""Yeah

""Got any plans for this great weather?"" he asked

""Yeah. Dinner with my boyfriend whenever he finally shows up
The smile fades off his face. ""Boyfriend?""

""yeah. I've been waiting for him here and he's seriously late. I'm about to go use the payphone to scream at him in a second.""

He stops for a moment

WHY IS THAT ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS?? I think. It probably showed on my face.

""So... you're just waiting for somebody. You're not hanging out on the corner

""I'm waiting for my boyfriend,"" I said, shoved past him, and went over to the same 7Eleven to use the payphone. I gave the man behind the counter a ""fuck off and die"" look through the window as I dialed. the counter guy has the courtesy to look embarrassed as hell this time because he was obviously wrong.

The man is still staring at me

Unfortunately my bf was not there, fidgeting angrily.

""Well, then without even checking which bus is coming, he just gets on it. I see him fumbling for change and realize the man is just trying to get away from me and didn't even know what the fare was.

My bf shows up 10 minutes later

""He thought you were a hooker. When he went to the cash machine

It never even occured to me that was going on. What sort of creeper continues to pursue someone AFTER they've walked away from you multiple times?? How clueless was this guy?

Needless to say

It still angers me to this day that I got NO support when I was in an obviously WRONG situation.

I posted another story of my first encounter when I was 11. I've also had a string of encounters at work that I like to call 'Adventures in Waitressing'. Maybe I'll write about those another time. The following

After work one night a friend and I decided to run to the Wal-Mart up the street together to grab a few things. This was a 24 hour Wal-Mart in a not so great area, the place was pretty busy and we were definitely further from the entrance than we wanted to be, but we managed to park near a light. We were pretty satisfied with our spots and headed inside. 

After about 15 or 20 minutes, we immediately notice a shady little hooptie of a car parked two spots down from mine, sitting in the open with two men leaning against the passenger's side. We continue as if nothing is wrong, smiling and chatting with one another, but our chatter has turned to ""you see these guys?"" ""yeah"" ""ok, we're gonna leave as quickly as possible, I've got your back"". We say goodbye, keys in hand

He yells out, because we're so fine and all. I'm starting to panic a little as he's getting closer and continually asking my name more and more aggressively. I finally get my door unlocked and open, and in frustrated stupidity I tell him ""My name is gir_loves_thecupcake, and I'm leaving. I jump in the driver's seat and slam and lock the door. As I'm sticking my key in the ignition, this son of a bitch actually leans on my car and continues to harass me about this ""party"" through my cracked window. Now, in the summertime where I'm from it gets incredibly hot even at night and is common practice to leave windows cracked for comfort. It's then that I realize, its still 90 some degrees out and this dude is wearing a long coat. The alarm bells are screaming in my head

 He continues to try and ask me questions and tell me that my fine friend and I really need to get in their car.

The whole idea of pedophiles and kids being abducted wasn't a huge publicized deal back then.  Well. at least not as much as it is now.  But we lived above a bar that was very busy every night.  Most of the people were nice

We lived on a busy street though, not the busy street).  So most of the time, we were stuck out in the back yard.  

So, and my cousin Krystle was 11 as well.   We were trying to play hide and seek but it was limited.  We were sort of used to the bar customers coming out the back door and going to their car, or vice versa.  Nobody ever said more than 'Hi' though, and they left us alone.

Well,  comes up and asks us what we are doing.  We tell her we are playing hide and seek, and it was my brothers turn.  Well, my brother was very small for his age, due to lead paint.  So he looked like he was 5 or 6.  So she comes over, picks him up, and puts him in an empty trash can.  This was one of those with the lid and the locking handles.  We are freaking out trying to get him out, and we tell her what happened.  Well, or infatuated, talking to my mom.  She was 16 at the time

Anyway, and all of a sudden this bitch shows up again, out of nowhere.  Apparently she made not of us going up the back stairs and remembered it later in her drunken stupor. Josh and Krystle run inside, but when I got up, I twisted my ankle, and so this chick grabs me by the arm, and tries to pull me out the door.

My neighbor comes running out and her daughter grabs my other arm

It was like magic, trying to comfort me.  So it wasn't all bad.  But anyway, I still had to go to the doctor because my arm was all frewed up.  

The next week this chick came by with the police and apparently had a much different story to them and somehow thought that Carrie and I were going to be paying for her hospital bills, a teenager and 2 adult witnesses that told the cops a different story about a drunk woman trying to abduct a kid.  The tone of that conversation changed and I was taken down to the station with my mom and stepdad, so I could answer questions.

This is for you, everyone you know. After reading these ten crucial tips, tell them to someone you care about. Print them, forward them, memorize them! It never hurts to be careful in this crazy world we live in.

1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do:

The elbow is the strongest point on your body. If you are close enough to use it, inbetween the ribs, any weak point. If you can, AIM FOR THE LEFT SIDE OF THEIR NECK! This may cause them to go unconscious.

2. Learned this from a tourist guide. If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse

3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car

4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, doing makeup, making a list, etc.) Don't do this! The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side, and tell you where to go.

As soon as you get into your car 

If someone is in the car with a gun to your head Do not drive off.

Repeat:

Do not drive off!

Instead gun the engine and speed into anything

5. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot

A.) Be aware: look around you, and in the back seat.

B.) If you are parked next to a big van

C.) Look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, or work, and get a guard/policeman to walk you back out.

It is always better to be safe than sorry. (And better paranoid than dead.)

6. Always take the elevator instead of the stairs. Stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot. This is especially true at night!)

7. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control

Always run!

The predator will only hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times; and even then

8. As a woman

Stop

It may get you raped

Ted Bundy, well educated man, who Always played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when he abducted his next victim.

Another Safety Point:

Someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last, and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over. The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way,whatever you do, Do Not open the door.'

He told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby... He said they have not verified it

This one applies for everybody: Water scam!

If you wake up in the middle of the night to hear all your taps outside running or what you think is a burst pipe

10. Come off as psychotic! Wear hoods, but this is important. The predator will take advantage of the fact you are weak in one sense. Jam your hands deep in your pockets.

If you are being followed, no bats in your underwear. That's the way I like it. I was expecting you. Do you know what blood tastes like? I would like to know..."" Add an evil cackle in there, and snap your neck all the way to the side. Act like an escaped schizophrenic on meth. 

Do not keep a weapon with you unless you fully intend to use it and know how to. Learn about your state's self defense weapon laws. I recommend pepper spray

We awoke to find police and ambulances around the camp.

There are - no - villages within reasonable walking distance so the sky is bloody dark. Anyway, misty rain and isolation the whole thing became very creepy.  Its around this point when I see him.

Our tent was looking over a large moor surrounded by forest and dotted with small lochs / ponds. The only reason I see him is because his reflection on the loch is illuminated by the moon. He's a good distance away, the weirdest thing about this guy was that he had horns.
So it was a deer
No, darting jerks, but very human ones. We concluded that this guy was nuts. His hands were holding antlers on his head and he was having a laugh scaring the kids in their tent. Whatever, right? Yeah, let's drink a little more.

So my friends and I biffed out for 30 minutes. This turned into jokes about Dr. Deer. This turned into my friends passing out in a drunken stupor. Hell

I decide to go out for a piss, again; whisky.  I'm standing in the darkness near a bush doing my business when I see movement. This time, close by.  Just as well I'm halfway through taking a leak, because.. you know. 
The deer man appears, I couldn't breathe, I COULD put my dick away because, you know, priorities. 

This guy stood and stared and grinned then said something. Being Scottish myself

The last glimpse I caught of him was his face as I looked behind me. He was running at me
For some reason, or was hiding crouched in the darkness.

Needless to say

To this day, we made sure to stay in a holiday home in the safety of a village.

So back in high school, out of view of the librarian, feet up on the table, headphones on my head and a book in my lap. I dont really know when this started because one day, I went into the front of my backpack (I would kick it under the table) only to find notes.. Like 10 folded up into those weird triangles with my first intial on them...

I opened them up to find ALL of them

No marking of who it was from, with my feet on my backpack and I could never get into my books cause I kept looking around. (only place I thought they could do it cause in other classes I sat in the back row with my backpack at my side, I know everyone that walked behind me)

One day after school, so I couldnt hear anything around me. Out of nowhere I felt like I was being watched/followed. I turned off my headphones and tried to listen, to see if I could hear crunching behind me. Nope. I did a casual glance around, didnt see anyone. I started fast-walking home and instantly ran up to my room and looked around out the window. (2nd floor of an apartment complex) a few days later I was outside watching my nephew play with the complex kids. One of the younger girls Danielle came over and sat next to me on the granite step in front of our door. I was drawing at the time and she was watching me. Out of the blue she asks ""So who was that boy that keeps coming here? Is he your boyfriend?"" (mind you shes like, 8-9) me ""What boy?"" Danielle ""The boy with all black. He dresses like you do."" My face drained of all color. I asked her ""Have you seen him at all today?"" Danielle ""Yeah. He once came and asked if you lived here, I told him you did. I thought he was your friend cause he said all the stuff you wear."" me ""Is he here now?"" By then my voice is panicky and she gets a little worried ""I dont know. Last I saw he was messing with Bills garage."" (Bill is our maintenance man. He hasn't been around for a month because everythings been ok recently)

I called to my nephew and had him come inside with me. He was annoyed but I set him up with the Xbox and he calmed down after that. I told my parents and showed them the letters. They called the cops and we contacted Bill to check out his garage. Sure enough it was broken into and it looked like someone was hiding out in there but they were gone.

No more letters after that

1348116187.0,106ejn,The Robin Williams Doppleganger &amp; Redneck: The Hillbilly,SmoSays,186,31,20,"I met Jessica in 4th grade and we became best friends almost immediately. We spent all day at school together and spent time at each others' homes. She was the second oldest of five

Our families quickly became intertwined. They were in the lower income bracket, was a school bus driver and the only earner in the house. The oldest boy was mentally handicap and did what work he could to help out, but his mom insisted on him saving for college. 

At one point Gail got hurt on the job and couldn't drive any more. I think her back was hurt or something, but it was there that Gail met Dan. 

Dan, but skinnier and taller. They had a short courtship and soon married. 

I remember him being a strict man with the boys

But he would also play with us kids. He loved to have tickle fights and - I remember this so clearly - loved to tickle Jess and me on the super-upper-inner thigh. I didn't like being touched there but didn't ever have a reason why. I just didn't want him to. 

While I never mentally cited him as the reason, and I know at one point they had roaches, but that was before Dan was in the picture) so he would set an appointment with Gail to have me go over there. 

They moved around a lot and Jessica was no longer in my same school. Sometimes she was even in different cities and yet we still kept in contact and she'd visit me when she could. 

Then came her twelfth birthday. It was at a hotel, if not all. I couldn't tell you what the rooms looked like or even what the rest of the hotel looked like. Gail and Dan had just had a newborn (boy #5, kid #6) and Gail frequently had to excuse herself to feed or change the baby. Sometimes the chlorine in the air bothered him (or something) so she left Dan in charge of us. A bunch of prepubescent girls. In bathing suits. 

Sometimes he'd just watch

I went home with no incident but that was the last I saw Dan in person. 

Fast forwardfour years. Jess comes over unnanounced (not unusual

Though it will be no shock to the readers to discover that Dan had been molesting Jessica ever since they married. Molesting feels too soft . . . raping. He had been raping her almost every night. Gail would be out on the meds she had to take to sleep (she was in a lot of pain from the injury she'd sustained) and he'd go into Jess's room and rape her. Over and over. 

She was afraid to tell her mom

Her mom, because she was at the age of consent at 16, plain old rape charges, he also got mad at Gail when she threw him out and punched her. So he also got battery. 

All in all, waiting for when he gets out, a restraining order against Gail, Jess, and the boys. 

Jess has had a rough life since then but with some therapy, with two sons. I still talk to her and her family, and they, us. We're not as close as we used to be, but still thick as relatives.

All in all, too.

I was probably 19. I had just gotten out of a bad relationship

A week or two after my break-up, I get an IM. ""Hey Katie, I'm David. How are you? I love your pictures. You are quite beautiful."" Okay, I was a very naive person in high school, so my initial thought was, ""How lovely! A compliment!"" I thanked him and continued to make small talk.

After a few weeks of chatting, or even clarify that they all went to the church together. So I gave him my number without hesitation. Yes, I know... It was a very dumb move. No longer than 5 minutes later, I start getting a phone call. Unable to recognize the number, I ignore it, and let it go to voice mail. Keep in mind that David and I are still talking on facebook, and there's no inkling that he wants to text or call me. My voicemail icon starts blinking. I get a shiver down my spine, ""Do I really want to listen to this?"" I cave in. ""Hey Katie, ""Why did you call me?"" He responds with: ""I wanted to hear your voice, so I pick up. ""Hey Katie

A few days later, it's David."" Why did that little introduction always creep me out? He would always leave messages about how much he cared about me, how he missed me and the sound of my voice, blah blah blah. This went of for weeks, and in that span of time, I met my boyfriend (current fiancée), Eric. Eric and I began talking in late October/early November. In December, I changed my relationship status to ""in a relationship."" I get a mass of furious texts. ""You harlot, and answered. Eric is a 6'4-6'5, a deep

A few days pass, I was already shutting the front door. To make matters worse, the house was pitch black, and no one was home. The first thing I do is check the side door. Locked. Next I scurry to the back door, and to my horror, it's slightly open. (it's a sliding glass door that leads out to the pool and enclosed deck.) The only thing on my mind at that point is FUCK. I grab my dogs (a pomeranian and golden retriever) and high tail it to my bedroom and slam the door. No more than a second later, my Golden starts going nuts. She's barking her fucking head off, calling Eric, somehow freakishly found my address, is at my window on top of the guy. It turns out

Sorry if there are any grammar and/or typos. I was rushing to get all my thoughts down as they were flowing in.

1375844709.0,1jux07,Murderer in the woods,coldbeeronsunday,176,21,21,"After finding this subreddit today

This happened circa 1971 or 1972

My mother is the oldest of 5 children - she has 3 sister and a brother, my mother, and all my aunts and uncles, so seven people total - into the woods for target practice with a rifle. My mother grew up quite poor and they didn't always live in the best neighborhoods, so my grandfather wanted to teach the kids how to defend themselves with the rifle if need be. 

Like I said, so this was a fairly rural area they were in. Since it was so far off the beaten path, my grandfather became startled when he heard the roar of a car engine so deep in the woods. My mom remembers the car as being a blue Ford Galaxie, so it looked something like this: http://i.imgur.com/PZw8qfH.jpg. 

Despite the fact that my grandfather had a gun, and just dumped her there in the woods and drove away. After my grandfather was sure the man had gone, everyone came out of hiding and the woman sat up and stared them straight in the face. My grandfather asked the woman if she needed help. She said no, she would be fine. She didn't seem to be injured and obviously didn't want help - she hadn't put up a fight with the man when he was dragging her out of the car (she must have known him?) - so my grandfather cut the shooting lesson short and decided to rush the kids home to safety. 

Well, but everyone was careful not to give away what they had just seen. The man struck up small talk with my grandfather, asked him how he was doing and what they were doing out in the woods. My grandfather explained that he had just taken his family out for some target practice with the rifle. The man told him to have a nice a day and continued driving. 

The next day, her purse, some Kleenex, and a pair of eyeglasses. He collected the items and took them home. According to my grandfather, that area of the woods was known for having shallow graves and being a dumping site for bodies. My mother became hysterical when he walked in the door carrying that stuff, she started screaming ""He killed that lady! He killed that lady!"" My grandfather ended up taking the items to the police station, but my mom doesn't think anything ever came of it - she never heard anything else about it after that.

Well, my grandmother called my mom when she arrived at work, just before the kids left for school. She told them not to take the bus that day, that she would come home and pick them up and drive them to school. When my mom asked why, my grandmother said, ""Because that car is waiting for you at the bus stop.""",,,,
1374854414.0,1j3qbz,"The Train, the Men, and the Lighter",,195,27, and they'd taken the car, where there is a massive condo development and a new grocery store.



I bought the food, you can get on the train and wait for about 10 minutes before it starts up again on the schedule. I was listening to music quite loudly on my headphones (because honestly, I don't have any interest in listening to the screaming babies/other people's conversations/etc.) After about two minutes, a group of four girls, who were all probably about fourteen or fifteen years old, sat down across from me. They were also dressed in the clothes typical of young women in the summertime: tank tops, shorts



A few more minutes passed, shirtless, and clearly drunk/high. The other looked younger, and was dressed in more typical clothing, but was equally filthy.



Despite the train car being nearly empty, and an elderly couple at the far end of the car-- the shirtless man flopped down on the floor and lay there. That wasn't surprising in itself: there are plenty of homeless people who use public transit, and aside from his smell, he wasn't bothering anyone. The other man, however, approached the group of young girls and started talking to them.




Initially, but after I saw the general discomfort in their faces I paused my music and listened. ""Hey!"" he called out to no one in particular. ""Why don't you take your shirt off and show me your tits?"" One of the girls laughed nervously but they all remained motionless. We were still waiting in the station for the train to pull out. As they sat there, he rapidly became more and more agitated. I should emphasize once more that these young girls were clearly no older than fifteen. They were terrified, and even though he hadn't turned around to look at me, so was I.



""Come on!"" He yelled, as though he was in pain. The shouting man reached out to grab the arm of the girls, and in unison they all stood up and ran off of the train. I thought about doing the same, but the train doors closed, and the chime sounded, indicating that we were leaving the station.



In an effort to be proactive, the shouting man followed me, and sat immediately beside me, his dirty pants brushing my leg. I shuffled over a little more but remained silent, as though I hadn't heard anything he had said to the girls. (Following my mother's cardinal rule of creepy situations: never engage crazy.)



The train clicked on for another few seconds-- it's about three minutes between stations-- before the shouting man pulled out a lighter and began playing with it. He flicked the flame on and off, he ""dropped"" his lighter on the ground immediately next to my foot.



His dirty hand grazed my leg as he reached down to grab it, he clicked the flint and brought the open flame towards my exposed leg, beaming widely. ""You've got a hair there, and I'm just going to get it for you,"" he said. 



Needless to say, and clearly he intended to follow me again. I swallowed hard, took my headphones off (which hadn't been playing for a few minutes, now), looked him dead in the face-- which was still beaming-- and said, ""Can I help you with something?"" 



I mentally kicked myself as soon as I said it, trying to keep him still for a moment. After what seemed like hours, the train pulled into the station. 



The chime sounded and I ran like hell, I sat down, and looked around to make sure there was no trace of either man. Clearly, they hadn't switched cars. I breathed a sigh of relief, and continued the remaining two stops home.



When I got out at my stop, wildly gesticulating and shaking. I stood still, hoping that they wouldn't notice me in the two-dozen or so people on the platform.



Fortunately, and then gone back in the direction of the end of the line, apparently with no end in sight.

      business wanted a woman who couldn't even talk to their
      customers
      year she lifted boxes at a large supermarket into a truck
      back breaking
      jewelry store. It was in the downtown of my city
      respected and popular
      there and miraculously got the job.


      The shop was owned by what she described as ""a quiet

      never really got a weird vibe from him

      although he was 20 years older than her and unmarried. One

      a nice older man who wanted to be seen riding with a pretty
      young girl
      outside and got into the red convertible.


      He drove not around the little roads in my city
      the bigger
      he was in a hurry to get to. Then he came to a large
      intersection and went straight on to the highway. By this
      time my mother was beginning to feel a little apprehensive.
      She knew no one
      No one would miss her if she didn't come home for supper on
      time. After driving for about a half hour on the highway
      mother silently opened the glove compartment on a hunch. She
      always told me that she still isn't sure why she opened the
      glove compartment
      nagging suspicion

      My mother closed the compartment and said nothing. She wasn't
      sure what to do
      highway and she was alone. Then the man turned to her and
      very casually said in Russian ""I could kill you if I wanted
      to.""


      My mother, and blonde hair blue eyed responded,
      ""I don't think you should try that
      defense and karate. Please take me home now.""


      She had never had a self defense class in her life.


      They didn't say much for the remainder of the ride.
      Eventually the man turned onto a dark
      my mothers horror
      drove the hour back to my town. My mother worked at the
      jewelry store for another 3 years
      contact with the owner as best she could. They still say
      hello on the occasion

      My mother would always conclude the story with ""So be back by

Also this isn't really scary but definitely creepy.


I'm a 26 yr old female with a 16 yr old brother and have lived in queens, in total there were 10 of us. After having a fun filled afternoon introducing my brother to the deep fried goodness of zeppolis and what not we went to a pizzaria right by the fair.


The place wasn't wide but was long. The booths that lined the wall on the right sat 3 people on each side then there was a narrow aisle and booths that sat 2 people on each side on the right. Being a half decent big sister I had my brother in the (in total) 6 seater booth in between me and a friend (we took up 2 6 seater booths and one 4 seater) 

this is where things start to get kinda creepy...


in walks a man and woman who genuinely looked like they did way too many drugs. They were probably in their late 50s early 60s. We wouldn't have noticed them if it wasn't for the fact that the woman was wearing a wedding dress. Long sleeves

The woman looked around, eating his pizza. ""Come on little boy you don't want to be around these teens"" I nicely turn to face the lady and ask her politely to leave us alone. She stands up and comes to our table and tries to reach over to touch my brother when my friend stands up and blocks her. She goes and sits down and starts harassing the young couple and their daughter. 

After about 10 minutes my brother announces he has to potty (the bathroom is a one person only type deal) so when my brother stands up and heads for the bathroom 5 steps away the woman asks him if he'd like her to help. At this point I tell her to fuck off and leave my brother alone

It was an ordinary day, by the beach so it wasn't a bad neighborhood but criminal activity wasn't rare to see. So anyways I go to class do the usual and before I know it the bell rings it was 2:30 pm and I was happy to be out and walk to the front of the school where I would always meet my mom.

My school was in a street which during school hours they would close it and no veichles were allowed to come in. It was until after school where they would open the gate and allow parents to come to the front in their cars to pick up their children.

I was a borderline recluse, I think she kind of knew that, and I was raising children and around pregnant people all the time so I was able to talk to her about my experiences and how I felt about doing that sort of stuff.

We had another cool boss by the name of Jerome, or someone to pick me up from work because I was going to work late hours as per the schedule.  (Yes, it was illegal for me to work those hours, but I digress.)

My birthday rolled around and I was getting friendly and finally being open with most of the people there.  I learned the ropes really well, but I didn't know how much.

Jerome worked with his wife, made Jennifer a sister in law to Jerome.  Jerome's cousin soon started working there, and time and time again he tried to get my number, knowing full well I was underage at the time.  I resisted because, he wasn't my type and he was already married, I found him disgusting.  But we were all pretty much a cool group of co-workers that hung out a lot.

A few months passed, and I knew it was illegal, but I went anyways and had fun.  Got drunk as hell too.  Jenny had her baby and she was out on the prowl looking for a guy, so I found one that she actually was kindly too and I exchanged numbers for them.  We all danced, went to Denny's, they walked me to the door and made sure I was safe and sound.

Possibly a week or two later

Jerome, and when they did, they found her dead.  She was laying on her bed, throat slit, the baby was strangled and dumped in the laundry bin.  When we found out, everyone was heartbroken.  It was bad.  

The police came in and questioned everyone, harassed me to the point of crying about the entire thing.  I had to call my sister to pick me up from work because I couldn't handle it the rest of the day.  Thanks to my sister and everyone else close to me who I talked to the death about, word got around my high school that I set Jenny up with a murderer.

A week or so after the questioning, saying that the guy I hooked her up with wanted to move in with her, etc.  Just basically getting angry about it all.  I understood his anger because that was his sister in law, but I didn't know why he wanted to tell me about it.  Then he asked if I had a ride home, and I really didn't, I was going to walk, so I told him no.  He said he'd take me home and we'd talk more about it later.  I really didn't think much of it.

That night, his car wouldn't start.  So we had to get a ride from another co-worker and all was well.

A few days after that, deciding to keep the child, which would add to his two that he already had with his sister.  She wanted to name him so she could get benefits, but he didn't agree with it.  So he went to the car to leave, but then came back and killed her and the baby.

One of the workers there, and that he was going to kill me because he thought I knew.  

I really didn't.  It was all a total shock.  Dad pulled me to the side and gave me a hug

Things pretty much went downhill after that.  Jerome's cousin kept pleading his innocence, that's how my first job went.  I recently went to look up news articles for this story and I googled his name, he has a penpal profile up now, and it made me sick to my stomach.

My parents usually take me and my siblings on numerous outdoor camping sites and I had great memories, there are other cabins in the area so I thought it was just a family lost and wanted to ask where their cabin was.  But when the windows rolled down it was some middle-aged guy and I remembered the inside of his car was pretty dirty.  He said 

""Hey kid you're not allowed to play baseball here.""

My mum and stepdad were going out for the night

At around 11:30 I heard a loud bang from outside, or some dumbass kids and ignored it. It happened a few more times, but I didn't really care. Then I heard a bang on my porch. It sounded like someone jumped up in the air and purposely stomped downward to make a loud *thud*. 

I was a little creeped, so after a few minutes of looking around I headed to my bedroom door to try the guest room window. All of a sudden something banged on my bedroom door and made it shake. I screamed and grabbed my swiss army knife (belonged to my grandpa, purely to remember him by). I shouted out ""I have a weapon! Get the fuck out of my house!"".

To start, I got a bus part of the way home and then walked the rest of the way. No big deal, I did this every day. What made this day different was the guy who stopped me.

He was tall, asking what high school I go to (the name is on my school jumper), what time the school finishes and so on. 

I'm feeling a little unnerved so I duck into a corner shop and browse around for about ten minutes before buying a chocolate bar. I didn't want to stay too long in case the owner thought I was a thief or something

Nope. He's still out there, catches up with me, starts asking for my phone number. I lie and tell him I don't have a phone, he asks again. I tell him again, sorry but I don't have a phone. He asks for paper so he can give me his number and then I can call him, which he seems pretty insistent upon. 

By this point I'm feeling a little sick. This guy's way taller than me

The guy backs off a little now which eases my apprehension

Anyway, trying not to show how freaked out I am, berating myself a little. Maybe the guy was just being friendly? Maybe it was a cultural thing, he didn't see anything wrong with exchanging phone numbers with a teenage girl.

My senior year of high school and all throughout my winter and summer breaks from college I worked at a kiosk in my hometown's mall that was associated with a local tattoo shop. We sold body jewelry and lighters and random crap like that. I really liked the job


On this particular day I was home for summer break after my freshman year of college and working at the kiosk one afternoon. My brother was graduating from middle school that day and I was waiting for my shift to end and for my parents to come pick me up to go to the ceremony. During the summer, I had already given him what he wanted and he kept his head down so I went back to helping the other customers. A few minutes later the phone rang to my store and I answered it-- ""Hello this is smallkitten thank you for calling [Tattoo Shop] how can I help you?"" The voice on the other line told me that he was the man who had just stopped and asked for a business card. I immediately thought that was weird-- why didn't he just ask me whatever it was while he was here? But his next sentence cleared it up pretty quickly for me. ""I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me sometime."" I said thank you and that I was flattered but I would have to decline and ended the conversation. I left to go meet my parents and didn't think of it again.


A few days later I was working alone again when the phone rang and I answered as always. ""Hello this is smallkitten thank you for calling [Tattoo Shop] how can I help you?"" It was the same man from the other day


""Well then I'll be waiting for you when you get out of work so I can rape you


I didn't even know what to do. I hung up the phone and did my best to not start sobbing, and my very tall, very dreadlocked, very facially-pierced friend stood at my work with me all day while I called the police and my boss. I filed a milion reports but there was really nothing anyone could do if I didn't see him actually do anything. Unfortunately his face was hazy to me because he had approached me with his head down and during a time when I was attending to other customers and I constantly wondered if he was actually in the mall, staring at me or even talking to me and I wouldn't even know it.


This guy continued to call and harass all of the female employees that worked at my store for almost a year with sexual threats. Everyone was escorted to their car at the end of the night by mall security and this continued for long after I went back to school. By the end of the summer I had regressed to wearing only baggy clothes and sweats with very little makeup because I didn't want to attract any extra attention to myself.

1347835712.0,zzqom,Mine,SaccharinePernicious,189,33,23,"So this story was on /r/nosleep but I ended up deleting it since nothing paranormal actually happened and I didn't really think it fit in that category.

I was about 14 at the time, we pretty much had the same interests in everything and there really wasn't a “friend to best friend” stage, it just jumped from not knowing each other to best friends.

Anyways, he usually would just have small shows around where he lived and the surrounding states and there would only be about a hundred or so people attending his concert.

I was pretty excited when I heard that she knew who he was and I explained to her that I already met him three different times. He was a really chill dude and he actually communicated with his fans

Just like any fan girl she immediately asked me if I could take her to meet him. I told her that the next time he came to our state I'd see what I could do. I just want to explain something very quickly. I do not know this singer personally, street address, email or anything that allows me to be able to contact him directly. My boyfriend during the time was in a band, and would often play shows throughout the state. Anyways, him being in a band gave him advantages, he got to meet a lot of really famous bands and singers and being his girlfriend during the time I would often go to his shows and get to meet the other bands after the concert. That is the only way I got to meet him that many times.

So three months go by. My friend comes running up to me telling me that he is going to be playing in my state in three weeks and we need to get tickets immediately. So I get the tickets the same day

Though eventually I started to realize that my friend started to grow an obsession over him. I didn't really think much about it then

I did find it annoying at the time though because she would always talk about him. When I say always

Fast forward to three weeks and it was the day of the concert. I apologize for all the time skips but I don't want to bore you with all the unnecessary details. 

So the plan was that she was going to come over my house, most not even stopping to meet him.

As my friend and I approached him she was spazzing out, but she just liked him, the lead singer) smoking a cigarette. Now he was and is a really attractive guy. He had really long hair probably five or six inches past his shoulders, I couldn't never tell if his hair was really dark brown or just black. He isn't a really tall guy, maybe 5'6 or 5'7 but it suited him. He immediately acknowledged us, in fact he actually remembered who I was and asked about my boyfriend (him and my boyfriend actually hung out a couple times). I talked to him for about a minute or so until my friend started just spewing stuff out at him. I can't remember everything that she said but I know most of it was pretty nasty. Like all the stuff she wanted to do with him, that she was in love with him

Being the kind of guy he was he just awkwardly laughed it off. I knew he was uncomfortable by the way he held himself and his body language. I remembered I tried to make my friend be quiet a few times but she just waved me off and told me she knew what she was doing.
She then started to scream at him that he had to marry her or she would commit suicide that night

At that point I knew that I needed to take her away from him and quickly. She was kind of bend down and keeping her face hidden. I attempted to grab her arm and pull her away from him but she yanked her arm away

After what she did I swore I was going to have a heart attack. Honestly at that point in time I don't think either him or me really knew what happened. I was really flustered and at some point I remember crying because I was scared. Interestingly enough he didn't call the cops. I found it really hard to believe he didn't given the situation we were in. I probably apologized to him a billion times before I left to find my friend but still to this day I still sincerely feel bad for what my friend did to him.

Oh but that is not the end

Shortly after the incident she then started to explain how she would see him all the time and how she believed he was stalking her. She would tell me how he would come to her in her dreams and tell her that he loved her so much and they were meant to be together. Sometimes she would even tell me he would sneak into her room late at night and sleep with her (I don't know what she meant by “sleep” I never really needed or wanted to know.) and then tell her how they were going to get married.

I didn't tell her during the time but he actually left my state the day after the concert, I was doubting my friendship with her but I continued to stay her friend.

That was until about a week and a half later. I was over her house to spend the night. She was in the bathroom taking a shower and getting ready because we were about to go out for the night. I was in her room sprawled across her bed when I had the sudden urge to look up at the ceiling. I couldn't help but to get a little panicked at the time when I looked up because her entire ceiling was covered in hundreds of pictures of the singer. I really didn't want to be at her house any more so I repacked my bags quietly so she wouldn't hear me

At that point I felt like I needed to get out of the house. Me and her were home alone. I was terrified  She was bigger then me and stronger so I had a difficult time getting her off. She lunged at me and wrapped her hands around my throat.

While she was on me she was screaming at me

I honestly don't really know how I got out of the situation but I do remember immediately telling my parents about the incident and then not soon after the police getting involved. My friendship with her after that went down the drain. I switched phone numbers and about six months later switched schools because I moved.

I don't know what happened to her to be honest. If she got arrested

If anyone has any questions about anything involving the story please feel free to ask. I do want to say I don't feel comfortable telling you the name of the band or the singer that was involved since I don't think it's right for me to do.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/zzqom/mine/

I was really curious about any creepy encounter I might have had when I was little, my own suddenly hits me like a sack of dicks and I have a panic attack because it was so vivid and I'd never remembered it before then. Blocked it, I guess.

I have a pretty good memory

Anyway, but there were holes big enough I could surprisingly stick my chubby kid hand in. I remember thinking that the ocelots were just baby cheetahs and trying to pet one of them. 

We started walking around the rest of the zoo, etc. Basically, we were having an awesome time and kid me was excited about all the animals around. That is, until my mom says she noticed a woman watching us intently. We wound up heading back to the big cat area because I would not stop blabbering about the ocelots. 

Mom says she got slightly nervous while we were walking back because she thought that the woman had been following us around. Mom has had a stress related mental illness

This woman comes up to me as I'm watching the ocelots, I nearly shat my pants at the opportunity, I ignore my stranger danger lessons and take her hand. As I'm walking I remember getting this feeling that I'm going to disappoint the hell out of my mom because I know going off with a stranger is bad, but *ocelots*, man. 

 I'm just beginning to be led away when I hear my mother shout. 

I turn around. It's kinda hazy, I wave bye to the woman as she stumbles away looking pissed off, and that's where the memory fades out. Mom says she had to physically wrench me from the woman because she kept yelling ""This lady is trying to take my baby!"". I started crying when the woman tried to lead me away again, and apparently shouted that she wasn't my mother. 

I just felt so emotional afterward our conversation and thanking her profusely like an ass

Last year I lived in a two bedroom apartment with a female friend, as someone in her hometown was getting married and she was a bridesmaid.

Since I was in the middle of a huge city, but I watched a film then went to bed.

At about 3am, I quickly put some clothes on, left the lights off, and crept towards the door.

Again, ""Get the fuck out here"". At this point I'm pretty much in tears, wondering who the hell is outside my door. I look through my peep-hole and I kid you not, there were about 7 huge guys standing by the door. Again, someone hammers on the door, and the door is shaking with the force.

So I press the security key for my building, no one answered it, because the security in my building was terrible. In all probability, I should have called the police, but for some reason I didn't, I called my boyfriend instead and tearfully told him I didn't know what to do. He instantly rounded up some of his friends and high tailed it across to my apartment, however by the time he got there

I have no idea when they left, he walked around the building with us for a while, and told me that none of the security cameras actually work, they're just there as a deterrent.

One day, the handicapped stall was at the very end, and I went into the stall right next to it. I entered the stall quickly and without inspecting it and immediately hung my purse on the hook. As I turned around, I noticed that there was a gigantic pair of men's sneakers poking under the right wall of the stall. From the way they were positioned, a person would have had to have been standing on the other side of the wall (in the handicapped stall) facing my stall. I freaked the fuck out. It was completely silent in the bathroom, and I was scared that if I acted alarmed that it would provoke the person into action (the entire time I'd been in the bathroom, the person hadn't spoken or moved at all). I hastily grabbed my things and went to leave. It was one of the bathrooms with a little vestibule-type thing before the entrance to the restroom, I heard a loud clang and turned in time to see that the door of the handicapped stall had swung open

Pretty anti-climactic, but I texted my mom and told her what happened, and she called the campus police for me. Never used that restroom again.

She's terrified and shaking so violently she can barely control it

She calls 911. No sooner did she tell the operator her address when the voice on the other end says that the situation has been taken care of. The police are already there. By the time she hangs up there are six cop cars lining her street in front of her house

1374625587.0,1ix7xv,The man in the sinking house,Redchilli007,178,25,32,"I'm about 16 yrs old and still in school and living at home with my parents.  I live in Ireland and its winter so it gets dark early.  At night me and my friends would amuse ourselves by running through the gardens of houses in our estate.  Its a pretty big estate with many houses so there is plenty of ground to cover.  We are not vandals or out to scare people.  Its all about the stealth of getting through it unseen but if the odd chase from a disgruntled home owner occurs so be it.

Our housing estate is on a hill and as we come to the peak of the hill we notice a house with all the lights off.  It looks like some of the curtains have been removed so we guess that a family has moved out and the house is for sale.  We used to play football during the day with the English kid who lived there

Soon after we learn one side of the house was sinking and the renting family was put up in another home.  Soon builders start working on the side of the house that is sinking.  They drill and add supports but they are losing this battle and the house remains abandoned.  We naturally use the house for fun

One night we notice a light in the house before we planned to enter.  It looks more like candle light rather than that from a bulb.  We don't enter through the window but walk to the front of the property and notice a beat up car in the driveway.  We figure someone has moved in or the council are onto us and have paid some guy to check up on the place but neither story check out.  The house is still sinking and vacant during the day and our buddies father works in the council says nobody has been asked to look after the place.

We get brave again and start entering the house and the odd time we notice the beat up car in the drive and do not enter.  One night we enter through the rear window

As I sit down I look up at my friend and he is stood in the middle off the room completely frozen with a look of fear on his eyes.  I can tell by the look of fear on his face he is not dicking around and then it hits me.  All of the furniture in the room is arranged differently then it was earlier.  I mouth the words ""Fuck"" silently to my friend.  He remains frozen.  I silently edge towards the window and look out onto the front drive way.  The beat up car is there.  That man is in the house with is.

We stay very quite, someone opens a door downstairs and starts running through the house fast and loud.  This person is now running up the stairs.  

He is making weird grunting noises like he is angry and in pain from his movements.  He explodes into the rooms upstairs.  Grunting

I am still under the bed.  Frozen and scared.  Trying to make sense of this all.  A nuclear war of panic is raging in my head.  I am utterly terrified and wishing I was at home but too scared too move.  All I can think about is why didn't I listen to my mother and stay out of trouble.  I wish I was at home with her right now.  I will never leave my house again if I make it through this.

More time passes cloaked under a shroud of pure terror.  The silence from downstairs is the worst part.  Its like he is waiting for any noise again before he pounces.  Eventually too much time passes and I need to speak to my friend again.  We can't stay here.  I whisper to him ""Are you still with me

My friend doesn't reply. I am wondering is he still there or was he grabbed.  Surely not? I would have heard him scream? He dare not speak in fear of angering the wild brute that lurks downstairs, that must be it, he is stood there in the darkness feeling as shocked and terrified as I am.  Finally he speaks.  ""We. Must. Get. The. Fuck. Out. Of. Here"" A wave of relief hits me upon hearing his voice and for  a fleeting moment I feel less alone but then the fear sets in once again.

""On Three.  We go.  Agreed?"" My friend replies yes.  ""One"".  ""Tw....   and then we here a grunt and a stir of movement from down below.  The I hear the sound of wardrobe doors crash open and running.  That cunt, he is close to the bottom of the stairs.  All of this is happening in some weird slow motion blur, in a strange way its like I feel high, but high from fear.  I just pray that my friend gets through that window and onto the roof quickly so I can make my escape.

I am about to reach the doorway entrance to the bathroom

As I pass the top of the stairs and enter the bathroom I glance down the stairs briefly.  Its dark, arms are flailing everywhere, he is wearing a long trench coat, I smell mould, he is out of control, angry, grunting and running right at me.  I enter the bathroom and make it to the window.  My friend is in the window frame, he is at the top of the stairs

When it came time for her to follow suit and move out

At her first work Christmas party, flagged one down, jumped in the front seat next to the driver, advised her destination and began making polite conversation.

As she tells it, pulled out a camera and started taking her photo. His compliments grew increasingly cruder and she asked him repeatedly to stop taking her picture before getting angry and yelling at him to stop the taxi and let her out - which he would not do.

Thinking quickly, she opened the door and jumped out. He was moving slowly enough at this point that thankfully she was not injured.

The second driver paused for a moment before informing her that the first driver had been taking her in the complete opposite direction of where she had told him she needed to go.

My two brothers (8yo and 14yo) and I lived with my parents in China for a while. My mum was studying at a university there and we lived on the campus. It was really safe there
                               
We were playing a game, so they stayed in the courtyard while I went to find the ball. At the gate there was a security guard who my mum was friendly with, so I said hello to him and he asked where my parents were. My Chinese wasn't too good, but I managed to tell him that they were at home. He looked a bit concerned, but I just said goodbye and went around the wall. The street on the other side was really busy and I thought I'd have a hard time finding the ball. I walked about a hundred metres down the road and looked around, but couldn't see any sign of it. 
                                       
I started walking back and was about ten metres from the gate when I heard someone call out ""Hello!"". In China we'd have people say that to us a lot, as I said, my Chinese wasn't too good, but I could understand fairly well. He held the ball under one arm and motioned for me to get on his bike, saying something like ""Hop on, you can have your ball"". At first I didn't understand what he meant, so I moved closer to him
                                         
I was getting freaked out at this point. The street had emptied out a lot, I was a pretty smart kid, smart enough to know that a ball isn't worth getting on a motorbike with a strange man in a strange city, but unfortunately I was also terrified. The guy was getting pretty insistent that I get on the bike and he actually got off the bike and started moving towards me. Luckily the guard my family knew had been keeping his eye on me and came running when he saw this. He told the guy to leave and took me back to the gate. The second I was inside the campus gate I said thank you and took off. I got an earful for losing the ball, but I knew it could've been a lot worse.

About 30 years ago my mom was driving home. She notices a car next to her trying to get her attention. She rolls her window down and the guy in the car asks her to pull over. She does. He pulls up next to her and asks her if she knows how to get to a certain road. My mom tells him she does and says to follow her and she'll lead him to it. He protests and says ""you can just get in my car and show me and then I'll bring you back."" My mom may have been the dumbest person on earth because she says ""okay"", puts it in park, and turns to my mom. ""You know I can kill you right now, right?"" He tells her. My mom said at this point she had finally realized how stupid she had been. ""Don't EVER get into a stranger's car."" He says and then drives her back to her car.

Right now, but I don’t like to drive, for many reasons, so I like to and prefer to walk places, just as long as the distance isn’t too bad. So, unless I arrange for a ride, I just walk my way there.  I’m not afraid to walk places, I wasn’t. 

 Of course, kidnapped, you know, all that stuff. It’s never quite bothered me before, I carry a knife in my bag , so I feel rather safe most of the time, not that I’m 100% confident with my knifing abilities, it’s the idea. Plus

  But

Anyways, his roommate asked me if I wanted a ride home. ( My friend’s car was in the shop, otherwise he would have brought me home. ) I declined, because I would feel bad making someone else stop to help me, even if they did offer.

 It wasn’t a long walk either, and I was in a dress because I hate to wear pants. Yes, I get a lot of shit for not wearing pants, but after a bit, you get used to your legs being cold, so I didn’t mind. 

 I started my walk

 A car was coming down the street in the opposite direction of me

  I was a good 3 yards away from him, but he had a heavy build, and the window rolled down.  

 “Hey.” He greeted

 “You want a ride?”   I shook my head

“No, then spoke again.  

 “Hey,  I promise I won’t hurt you.”  My head screamed at me to keep going. 

 “No




 He rolled up the window




  “Girl. Come to the car.” His voice sounded harsh, we can make deal.”  




 I watched him quietly




“Just come to car.” He unbuckled his seatbelt
I couldn’t make it all the way home




 I heard him swear loudly

 I can’t explain the thoughts I had been thinking


“SHITSHITSHITRUNFUCKSHITKNIFEKNIFEGETTODOORCARCARSHITRUN.”




 I ran all the way through the apartment hallways and nearly collapsed once I got into my friends apartment, waiting, as I’m desperately shaking and trying not to lose the rest of what composure I had left. 




 My friends laughed it off




 Realizing that they, I dropped the subject and tried to not think about it as I gladly accepted blue’s roommates offer to drive me home.  





 The entire way home, locked everything, and went to bed. 





 The next morning, startling honk from behind me made me whip around with a disgusted expression on my face, ready to yell at my sister’s boyfriend or one of my neighbors for being a jerk and scaring me.



 But it wasn’t my sister’s boyfriend
The white car, was in front of me.  




 Arms full with grocery bags, which horribly failed in comparison to, well,  everything. 




 He pulled out away from  the curb, but it felt like hours.  I swallowed the lump in my throat.  




 His face was covered with a red ski mask

I made a friend at the club whose stripper name was Caitlyn. She was my first work friend when I moved there. She texts me one day saying she has a bachelor party and sends me a picture with stacks of money. I shit you not there is over $100, accept.

She picks me up in a tinted out escalade

The ""party"" ends up being cancelled and I spend about 3 hours running errands with these two. Then Caitlyn says she needs to stop by our club to meet with a 'client'. I end up alone in the car with Adrian. He takes me to where he's from. The ghetto. I've never been there before and as a white girl from suburbia I don't know how to act. I literally can not understand the ebonics

We leave one 'trap' house

They let us go and I ask to be taken home, I can't have scared girls like you runnin around with me incase we get in a jam.""

WHAT?? I have a permit to strip, but he's holding on to it because he thinks I'll text people where he's at and have them jump him. I'm new to the area and have NO IDEA where I am. Now I feel trapped.

We run errands all over the ghetto for 3 hours. The whole time adrian and I are in the backseat and his hands are rubbing my leg up and down or he's copping a feel of my boobs. I keep trying to swat him off but he holds my arms down sometimes and it hurts. At 3:30 I start holding my ground. ""I've been asking to go home for THREE HOURS. TAKE ME HOME NOW"". He starts calling me a bitch and saying caitlyn never told him I was such a bitch and if he knew he never would have picked me up in the first place. He's now so high he doesn't want to drive me home and is going to have caitlyn do it

We go back to where caitlyn and him ""stay"". It's in a nice neighborhood but I notice there are no clothes in the closests

Adrian takes a shower and comes out with only his towel on. He sits next to me and is really fucking demanding. ""Put your arm around me. CHILL THE FUCK OUT ALLISON."" I get scared and just do what he says. He says ""would you feel more comfortable if I bring one of my guns out here??"" No I would not . I do not want those around me. 

He keeps trying to mount me and touch my vagina. When I get up to sit somewhere else he smacks my ass then moves to where I am. At one point he picks me up and throws me onto the gigantic bean bag chair then takes his hand and holds both mine above my head and starts kissing my neck. His towel is falling off and he's naked on top of me and I'm in a skirt and I'm FREAKING OUT and writhing telling him to get off me PLEASE I just want to go home.

Caitlyn says she's on her way but never shows up. After another couple hours of trying to dodge him from touching me, I'm too scared to call incase it wakes adrian up. She doesn't answer but it's 6 am now so I fall asleep and wake up at 8 and ask adrian to take me home. He says I can take his car but I have to come back the next night to make it up to him. I say ok, and was just going to leave the car on a street and have it get stolen. He says I have to ""bob on his dick"" to get privileges like that. I say I'm just going to get my stuff.

I get my bag and RUN out of that house now that it's daylight. My phone is only charged one bar and I'm confused

I call my roommate to send me a taxi number and wait 45 minutes on a random persons front steps waiting for the taxi to come. I see adrian driving around the neighborhood but I'm behind plants and a pillar on this front step and he can't see me. Caitlyn and him are calling me off the hook. 

Since then

Sorry it was such a LONG story



TL;DR: Get tricked into doing a bachelor party which really meant get introduced to a pimp and trapped with him for hours trying to touch me.



EDIT: To everyone saying I should call the police: no. When we were in the ghetto he said he ""had my back."" That he had my back in a way that if anyone messed with me he could ""have anybody killed. Anybody. I don't have to pull any trigger because there are so many out of work cousins in this neighborhood that would do anything to feed their family"". He's been locked for murder before.

Many of what we like to call ""Winnipeg's finest"" get knifed around there so it wasn't the most ideal place to be leaving at 2 in the morning. But whatever

1347032015.0,zid03,The creep at the caravan park,amylondon,184,32,9,"Hi all. This isn't my story

This happened when my boyfriend, Maggie, was 13 (now aged 23 and 24). They were holidaying with their mum and step dad in a typical British caravan park somewhere in Kent (believe it was a Haven). If you don't know a typical seaside caravan park in the UK, then it's basically a cheap getaway where you stay in a mobile home, and there's usually an onsite facility with things like karaoke, live entertainment, amusement arcades and a pub etc. It's very cheap and cheerful, and just generally your typical working class holiday.

The family were all at the on the on-site disco one night. The adults were sat at a table and the kids were dancing on the dance floor, but still looked like a young teenager and no older. After being sufficiently creeped out by the man, she went and sat with her mum and step dad. The man continued looking at her but she tried to ignore him and eventually went back to dancing. After a while, she went to the bathroom; shortly after entering the man followed her in. All alone in the bathroom, he pinned her up against the wall and said something along the lines of ""I know you want it"". She managed to get away and ran back to the table with her parents. The song ‘Red Red Wine’ by UB40 was playing at the time, which she still can’t listen to to this day (this is how I first heard of the story, by randomly singing the song). She didn’t tell her parents then and there

They all walked back to their caravan. At this point her mum and step dad had obviously noticed something was wrong and when they were inside she told them what had happened. Now, and he’s a nice guy, but also the kind of person you wouldn’t want to mess with. One of those people that are very well known around the area. Anyway, Rob suggested that him and Maggie go out for a walk. She really didn’t want to leave as she was still terrified, but he convinced her fresh air would do her good. So off they went. Not a 100m on and Maggie goes all shy and starts hiding slightly behind Rob. It’s the creepy man from earlier walking towards them. Maggie tells Rob it’s the man who attacked her in the bathroom. He immediately runs towards this guy and starts beating the living shit out of him, in all the commotion my 12 year old boyfriend runs out and tries punching the guy as well. All this time the guy keeps shouting “I thought she was 16, I thought she was 16”.

Either due to coincidence or someone in a nearby caravan hearing and seeing the commotion, I promise I never killed them”.  Maggie, Rob and my boyfriend are all a bit confused and weirded out at this point but after talking to the police are allowed to go back to their caravan.

Around two days later they find out in the local paper that two teenage girls bodies had been discovered not far from where they were staying. They were around the same age as Maggie. I think she had quite a lucky escape there.

My grandparents lived in a big neighborhood. It was nice old neighborhood with tall houses and trees everywhere. Everyday after school, as I was biking down to meet my friend, I noticed a garage sale on a perpendicular street. There was only one truck parked by the sale, so it wasn't busy, and a friendly looking old man that was running it. I figured it wouldn't hurt to just see if they had toys, so I biked down there.

 Immediately, toy houses. All of them compelled my interest, but there was a small fluffy teddy bear near the ""cash register"" that I was simply mesmerized by. It was one of those old teddy bears- the ones with mechanisms on the arms and legs that made them move? It also had a distinct floral scent, which I'm pretty sure was roses. As I held the teddy bear, I noticed the old man was gazing at me from a lawn chair next to the cash register. (Which was halfway in the garage.) Not a stare, not lust, but a gaze- almost like he had just seen an angel. He had a smile on his face. Not warm really, as if he had seen an angel. As I was a sheltered little girl, because I was a stupid, the situation was starting to get unnerving. He pulled me in close

He hugged me tight, but he had his hands on my upper legs when the hug was finished. He was holding me there, but stroking with his thumbs at the same time. Then he whispered- ""I'll give you something else you like if you give me some sugar, sweetie.""  I pulled away and very politely told him no, thanked him heartily for the teddy, then skipped back down to my bike. As I turned back to wave at him, he smiled again. This time though.. it wasn't the awe-struck smile as before. It was dark.. full of ill-intent. He blew me a kiss. That grin on his face finally made me realize for the first time- okay, told my grandmother about the really creepy guy

Never was bothered by pedo again, and yet he let me walk off!

When I last wrote, you can see two lines where his tires had killed the grass. After four days of him refusing to move his car, I called one of our other landlords. This landlord came over and spoke with the guy. Creepy neighbor states that he can't move his car, because the apartment complex lot ""is full."" My landlord walks over to the lot with him, where the lot is about 90% empty. Creepy neighbor moves his car immediately afterwards. 

We're pleased. He still stares at us, the contractor for the house stopped by to check up on everything and see if we needed any work done. We told him no, and chatted for a while. He turns to leave, and then he turns back to me. ""Hey, I don't know if you've run into him yet, but you should steer clear of the guy in the white van.""

""What?"" I ask

""Yeah. A few weeks before you guys moved in, but there's something wrong with that guy."" The contractor left, shutting the door behind him.

June passes quietly

**July 13

On Saturday night, playing some pong, really nothing rowdy. One of the girls leaves, and the other one goes outside to talk on the phone with her boyfriend briefly. She comes back in after about 20 minutes, telling us that a cop was outside and that she had just been questioned/ID'd for a noise complaint. I go outside, and see the cop pulling out of our driveway. I asked her if she had been issued a citation, but she told me that she hadn't. I'm irritated, but let it go

The next morning, no one in my house smokes, and no one in my house would smash beer bottles in an area where we frequently walk barefoot. It looked like someone had been standing outside the house, five feet from my front door, smoking for a long period of time. Then they'd either thrown a beer bottle at the house, or just smashed it there. Either way, I'm really freaking not okay with it

**July 15

This all brings me to last night. My car has been acting up recently, caused my car to die last night around 11PM, which is inconvenient since I need it to get to the airport tonight. So I decide to jump it with someone's help, and to drive it across the street and let it die at the mechanic's so they can fix it in the morning. No one in my house knows how to jump a car, so I head over to 7-11 to recruit someone to help. A nice lady who works there and who knows us pretty well by now comes over, and we're fiddling with my car for a while. Turns out my jumper cables were faulty, so we pull another set out and my car gets working! 7-11 lady goes back to 7-11, and my female roommate and I hop into my car to drive it across the street. I park it at the mechanic's station

""Officers, an older guy, goes to 7-11 to ask the lady there to corroborate our story and ask if we were being loud, which we were not. Cop 2, a young, attractive cop, runs our ID's and continues to ask us questions.

I bring up the neighbor. Cop 2 seems exceedingly interested, ""Is it a heavy-set man, mustache, baseball cap?"" We tell him YES that's him! As this conversation is happening, we see the neighbor slink out of 7-11 and pause, clearly trying to listen to see if we're getting in trouble.

The cops ask us what kind of car the guy drives. I tell him, and you'll know it when you see it, I promise!"" Cop 1 goes to check out the van and run his plates and stuff.

We keep chatting with Cop 2, towards our front door. The cop car is still parked at the end of the driveway/parking lot. We ask him about security cameras, where he thinks that we should put them, etc. As we're talking, all of the sudden we all notice something. 

THE NEIGHBOR IS RIGHT THERE. AT THE COP CAR. Peering into the cop car with his hands all over the windows. The cop shines his flashlight on him, and runs, pretending like he has no idea who the cop is talking to. I'm freaking out at this point. The neighbor darts back to his apartment building, pretending to go inside. He had just ducked around the corner though. He was listening. We can all see his elbow poking around the corner as he stands there. The cop tells us to stay safe, and that he'll be outside for a long time tonight. We go inside, and lock the doors.

After about 15 minutes, and she tells us what went down. Apparently the cop came in to talk to her, and creepy neighbor comes bursting in screaming. He tells the cop that we party all night, every night, until the wee hours of the morning (false) among other things. He tells the cop that ""he's going to teach us a lesson."" He says that we're ""going to learn some respect"" from him, and other things along this line, which explains why Cop 1 looked much more concerned when he came out of 7-11 than when he went in...

So this morning, that's an offense. I walked over to the mechanic's at about 8AM this morning to get them to look at my car, and then I walk back. I'm exhausted, I skip class today because I didn't sleep last night. I feel like crap. I get a voicemail from my mechanic telling me the price of the work they're doing ($213) and tell me to call back if I have any questions. Fine by me, I'll just wait for them to call me for pickup.

I started thinking, if not likely.

And that's where I am. I'm sitting in my bed, and then I'm going to call Cop 2 from last night (he gave me his card). I am officially scared, and my camera cannot come fast enough.

About a year ago I was at my on campus bar with some friends and was good and dickered. A guy came up and started dancing with me which was fine, poor, drunk student I am I agreed thinking hey free cab ride worse comes to worse why the fuck not. 

So we go to his place and sure enough he puts on a movie, and offered a pair of his boxers for me to wear. Again I declined, this time he was rudely insistent, almost to the point of begging. He told me that he really wanted me to wear his boxers, I still said no - not really wanting to be semi naked around this guy. Eventually he gives up and comes over trying to do anything and everything he can - felt like I was being mauled. All the while I'm physically pushing him off of me and telling him no. 

At one point his roomate knocked on his door wanting to go for a smoke, we have this rule called Monkey Slutting where if one of us texts or says it to each other they do what ever needs to be done to get you away from the guy that is bothering you. So I put this in effect, telling her to call me in like 10 minutes complaining that I need to come home. So the guy comes in as she calls back and when I get off my fake phone call with her I tel him I need to go home. This guy won't take no for an answer and is literally blocking the door telling me my friend will be fine. I keep protesting say I have to go and he slowly approaches me, essentially backing me up to the bed. 

Again he pushes me to the bed trying to do all and everything he can, to get off me etc. It's at this point that i'm thinking holy shit I'm going to be raped. He's not listening, so finally I say I have to go to the bathroom and then I'll come back. I go to the bathroom and call a cab giving him the guys address and telling him to come ASAP. My full plan is to go sit outside (even though it was blizzarding out) without telling him and wait for the cab. I open the door to see him standing outside of it waiting for me, he claims he was afraid I would get lost in his house. I tell him that I called a cab already and have to get going. 

He resigns himself to the fact that i'm leaving and goes fine we'll go wait for the cab. We get to the front door and I go to wait outside, I'm feeling a little hot and the cool air would be nice. To which he forceably tells me NO wait in here. So I go to sit on the couch (he was sitting in a chair) and he goes no come sit on my lap.

""Nearly two months ago there was a customer at work - he was probably in his 50s. I noticed he started following me around the store, stroking my arms and hair etc, so I started freaking out. He got really sleezy and creepy, telling me to meet him at the hot pools the next day to have some wine, that I should stay with him at his house, and I should be the ""special guest"" at his place for dinner that night. I looked around for any of the guys I work with or the security guard, but they weren't around. He kept asking things like what my car looked like and where I lived etc.. Anyway eventually he left and I found Jason the security guard. Completely had a break down, showing Jason what happened with the security tape footage.
The same guy came in the next week. I had been freaking out all day, he's standing right there. I freaked out and tried to run over to Jason but he grabbed my arm and pulled me into him saying I was rude for not accepting his inviatations. The guys got him off me and Jason trespassed him, so he's banned from coming in the store for two years. Jason had to talk to him before he trespassed him though, and the guy knew what car I drove, what school I went to, that I was from England...I was so fucking scared.
But it had been ages since I saw him and I thought he wouldn't be stupid enough to come back. When I finished work and went out to my car, but he just kept shouting ""you will be my special guest. you will love it. you'll never want to leave.""

(Also sorry

It was about 10 years ago, but it wasn't anything excessively creepy, just annoying. I just figured I'd have to do my best to avoid/ignore him in the future. Other that that the day goes smoothly and I go home.

Now as a bit of background, and you wouldn't be able to tell that by looking at it. The only way to get to our part of the house was via steps leading up to the deck outside- our only entrance. For some reason I happened to be staying by myself that night, my other family members were out of town for whatever reason.

So I'm outside on the deck when I see the skeezy coworker pull up outside my house. I have no idea how he found out my address, so i head down the hallway. For some reason I decide to go into the bathroom instead of my bedroom, which ends up being lucky- my bedroom door didn't have a lock, but the bathroom did. 

I'm in the locked bathroom waiting to hear if he's (I'll start calling him Chris, calling my name out, he even tried the handle on the bathroom- thank god I had locked it. He eventually leaves, but this was only the beginning...

Now at this point of course, when he was just trying to be friendly, or something. Again, if this happened today I wouldn't have let it escalate the way it did, but such is the case with many of these stories...

Now the phone calls start. Again, nor did I take it off the hook bc  I thought that might give him a sign that I was home. He called over 30 times that night and left 11 messages, I counted. The messages he left on the machine were so creepy- it would just be silence then him saying my name- 
""....Daisy...Daisy...Are you there?.....Are you there Daisy?...Daisy
 Every time

At this point I had locked the door and closed all the blinds (except the front door didn't have one, throwing pebbles at the window, circling the house. Again, should have called the cops, but part of me thought that he was just really socially awkward and didn't realize what he was doing was way over the line. But i didn't want to confront him, regardless of whether his intentions were to rape/murder me.

I did eventually call my mom, again only one way in/out of our part of the house.

Eventually I hear more footsteps on the deck (again), it ends up being 2 friends of mine who were just randomly stopping by- I have never been so happy to see them in my life. We quickly go to their car and I end up spending the night at their house.

The next morning my mom and I go to the police station to file a report- I was afraid he was going to come back. What's creepy was that when I told the cops his name, my mom went with me and we told my manager what happened the night before. To his credit he said ""we don't need people like that working here"" and immediately found Chris and fired him. I didn't tell everyone my story but word got around and everyone at work was really supportive.

Luckily nothing further happened after that, and also not hesitate to call the cops!",,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,

1335105022.0,smmvz,Stared Down,wtstephens,185,32,17,"Many years ago when I was about 13 y.o. I was active in the Boy Scouts. One August weekend we had traveled to a state park in rural WV. This trip would be the first time most of us have gone spelunking (caving)

We arrived on Friday evening, there was a little lake within view of our campground. We stayed there for a matter of a few hours, using a variety of lures and methods - to no avail. When it got to be about 11:30, Seth (my best friend at the time) and I decided we were going to get up early to fish. You see, we were staying at a campground in West Virginia but we would get in a car the next day to travel to Ohio to the caves. If we were to wake up early, we could buy more time to do what we wanted to do - catch some trout. Not only that, neither of us had a trout license so if we were to get up early then none of the adults would able to stop us. Win-win.

At 3:00 AM my watch alarm beeps, as we silently gather our fishing equipment, slip on our boots and make the trek out.

The night was clear and cool. We didn't need to bring flashlights

We followed the creak, about three miles overall. As we walked, the trees and brush thickened. We expected as much, as we had seen a map of the area and there were no roads or trails that ran out here. We were completely immersed in nature - or so we thought until we ran into a cabin in the woods.

The cabin was relatively small, the pale blue light of a television glared.

We had still not reached the fishing spot we were looking for, right? I know it is common for rural people to rise early, but 4:00 AM? There could be now way... 

We stepped lighly beside the hut to try to pass it

The resident of the hut was standing int he window

We could not make out his face through the frosted glass

But he never sat down. He definitely saw us. But 10 feet away this grown man was staring at two kids through the window. Thoughts began to race through our minds. What would he do to us? Why was he up at 4:00 AM to begin with? Was he even the real resident of this hut

The answer to these questions did not matter - all the mattered was the fact that this guy was continuing to stare at us, I remained still. I shut my eyes and focused everything I had on remaining perfectly statue-like. I breathed in my nose and out my mouth. In my nose and out my mouth. This went on for a full 10-15 minutes (though it felt like a half hour or more), until I breathed in my nose and out... out... oh crap I had to sneeze. I pressed my tongue against the roof of my mouth in hopes of suppressing it, but I could not refrain.

I sneezed. The guy in the windows sneezed

It wasn't a window, that was my silhouette against the moon.

Like many, especially as the search for good spots often leads you to some pretty unsavoury places. I've been attacked and chased a bunch of times but the creepiest encounter was far more mundane.

The first time I met the Doctor, but like any big innercity park, it attracted some undesirables. The public toilets in particular were a favourite of junkies, deviants and pedophiles. This day, I remember I was skating shirtless, probably on account of the heat. As I skated through the afternoon, I slowly became aware of an older man leaning on the fence watching me. He rounded the fence and came over to the bowl, a very hirsute middle-aged man who looked vaguely mediterranean

He greeted me enthusiastically, I had no reason to be suspicious, although his rant was certainly peculiar. 'In my country, we love young boy!' he exclaimed once or twice, funny in hindsight. English was clearly not his first language and he talked kind of like the Borat character. After a beat, he continued, telling me how he worked at a gym as some kind of doctor, and produced his identity card. This is where alarm bells started ringing

The doctor then asked me if I'd be willing to come to his home and help teach him English, his 'work with boys' and how we had a connection. He was getting a bit handsy and I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable, particularly as my top was bare. To get him off my back I told him I'd think about it and went back to skating.

It couldn't have been more than a few days later, there were pages torn from porn magazines scattered all around the bowl that afternoon. We skated, mostly ignoring each other until I noticed the doctor lurking about by the fence. When we noticed him, he came around again, and seemed confused by the porn. He picked up a page and kept asking us 'You like that? You like that?'. This time I was mostly ignored and he focused all of his attentions on the 12 year old kid, even making the same offer he had made to me. After he'd finally left, I pulled the kid aside and told him to absolutely avoid that guy at all costs.

I thought that'd be the end of it but nope, he'd show up and watch me. Once I was skating with a friend and the Doctor showed up quite unexpectedly with two bottles of ice-cold Coke for us. I'm a bit ashamed to admit that after he'd fucked off, we drank them (although we thoroughly checked that they hadn't been tampered with). Hey, it was a hot day!

I began to get annoyed at his constant harassment and stalking and I'd noticed how like with the 12 year old and some other youngsters his attentions were focused across a number of people. I made these thoughts known to an adult skateboarder who I often sessioned with down at the bowl

I started thinking about making a run for it, knowing running would be no use if he wanted to follow me since he had a car and could easily keep up. Besides, his car was completely blocking my path so I wouldn't be able to get away anyway. And even if I could somehow make it around him, we were already on my street so he'd have no trouble figuring out where I lived. I swear, and couldn't even figure out what any of my options were.

I felt trapped and my mind actually started wandering towards the idea of just giving in and getting kidnapped. Like I said, I couldn't remember a single way out of there, and it seemed like the only option I had left. With a look of absolute resentment on his face he said, ""are you kidding me? You must be kidding me."" Then I noticed the car door was opened just a crack and that he looked ready to pounce. Becoming visibly frustrated he groaned, ""fine, $80."" I didn't know what to do.

I grew up in a wooded region of upstate New York in a little town called Minisink, I can recall only good things from my childhood. We lived on a 7-acre property with pines that littered our backyard and rolling hills in the front. It was an exemplary place to experience my childhood; rural and a friendly environment, with plenty of room for fun and activities. Neighbors were scarce, and vehicles were seldom.

In 1992, watching me and my older brother play relatively close to the road. All of a sudden, a blue hatchback came creeping up our street very slowly and paused to the entrance of our driveway. Again, this was odd not only for the fact that we lived in such a rural area, but the occasionally car we did see drove excessively fast since our road was pretty much barren of anyone and anything. My mother became concerned because, to her recollection, she had never seen this car before.

The man had apparently waved at my brother and I and smiled. Too young to comprehend the whole ""stranger"" rule, slowly descending and ascending each finger rhythmically. He proceeded to drive off, and my mother didn't allow us to go outside for the remainder of the day.

My mom told my father what occurred once he arrived from work, including the latches on the garage doors (which we rarely did). My parents had done everything in their power for protection and began to shake off what had happened once they were preparing to sleep.

My mom had a ritual of waking up at 3-3:30 in the morning and stepping outside in our garage for a cigarette. That particular morning she groggily stepped outside

Towards the end of her session she heard a very subtle noise towards the automatic garage doors, went outside, but did not see anything. No one was there. However, my mom swore up and down like nothing before about how she would not mistake a noise like that, even in her most groggy state. She was certain, also, that it was the man she had seen earlier. An animal would have not been able to turn that handle, too. We all kept in close contact with one another

About a year later, including a pregnant woman and a 14-year-old, and dumped their bodies in various places.

The man who was charged was undoubtedly the man who had stopped and waved at us. My mother is entirely positive and swears on her life. His face still sticks with her

I met him in tenth grade. I don't remember when we started talking, and told me an a deep, powerful voice, 'Jafa, cree!' I knew what it meant, and I stood at attention. He laughed, clapped, too. He was tall

We would talk from time to time, despite what a few people say, a man stealer. Even after they broke up, I didn't go for him. He was too good for me. He was sweet, and quiet, and a little dorky. And, at least to me, he was great with hugs. I never had to ask. It was like he knew. His hugs were great

The next year of school began, working with raw material, one of only three girls in a class of burly, silly men. David took cooking, and boy, was he amazing. He never bragged about his skills or how good he was. He just smiled and shared his food... or more gave us his food seeing that he never really ate it. I always looked forward to seeing him, because I could sit next to him and forget the buzz around me for a while. I rarely ate in the mornings. I felt fat, thinking that the first thing I had to do was eat.

I always felt weird, that he heard the storm starting, while the TV was blaring, and his mom was on the phone, and the windows were shut. I smiled, eyes wide. Finally, someone else knew what I heard all my life; everything.

I forgot my book one day for out loud reading. I hated my teacher. I swear to this day she was a homophobe, but what could I do? No one in that class liked me, save for David and some dude named Adam. Adam was nice, if only because he left me the hell alone. David sat in front of me, and Adam in front of him.

So, and when my turn came up, something touched my leg. I looked down, and there was David's hand, passing his book back to me. I took it, and mouthed a thank you. He nodded and smiled. I gave it back when I was done reading. I thanked him later, and he said not to worry about it. People always thought I was weird, too. That was why we got along

Well, and everyone was talking about David. I asked around, but they all just looked at me and didn't tell me anything. Some kept asking me if I knew who I sat next to, and the answer was always the same; David. They made fun of me because I didn't know. I went to Jeff, and I asked him. He's one of the sweetest guys I know. His soft face twisted into a pinched and outraged mask. He told me. Jeff told me everything.

On the evening of March Twentieth, and the sitter took him home to go, leaving the seven year old girl alone. Time passed. The sitter returned, but the girl was missing. She looked for the girl, and found her, but something was wrong. The girl told the sitter that a man came to her, and asked her for help with something. The sitter called the police.

This happened a while ago when I lived in Brussels. I was 7 years old turning eight in a few weeks and went for a sleepover at my friend Lorenzo's. He lived with his mom on the 4th floor of a big appartment building in the center of the city. Neither his father nor his older brother (around 20-ish) were home since they were in the military and both off on duty somewhere (can't exactly remember where

Anyways, but as soon as she hit the pillows herself (with the help of a few sleeping pills) we were back up and playing again, only with the lights off.

A little after midnight we noticed two shadows against the window. Two men were climbing up the wall. However, making fun, even calling names (""hey poopy-face, don't slip, you'll fall in poop""). We fell asleep after they were passed.

The next morning we told Lorenzo's mom about the men. She paled and called the police. It turned out that they were robbers. They went for the appartment above us, weren't cooperating they tortured and killed them.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,1345236371.0,,
1339984602.0,v7cha,No More Closing Shifts,mozzybear,171,22,29,"Hello all! I've been a long time lurker on LetsNotMeet

To start off, good people, everybody knows everybody--that sort of town. I live along the shoreline and am about 5 minutes from the beach, so in the summer time the town population practically triples as out-of-towners flock to their summer beach houses. My friends and I shared a mutual dislike for these people because they all would walk along the main roads with no shirts on, trashing a lot of the public areas, and driving carelessly on the roads, but I digress...

Last May, mostly people who have retired, as well as a lot of families. It wasn't really a town where you'd see many people between the ages of 20 - 30. It was very, very safe.

Anyways, so after cleaning up the shop my co-workers and I would leave by about 10. I started my shift with my co-worker Kenny who's 20, and he ran the deli while I ran the ice cream.
My bosses had gone out for the day and left the employees in charge,) and it was just me and Kenny in the shop that evening.
It was a slow day and I had just signed in and began cleaning behind the counter when Kenny approached me and said

""I figured to say that since they're not here

Kenny nodded and said,"" he motioned to his face, ""and he was wearing a black tee shirt and a Mets hat.""
I nodded and continued cleaning. The afternoon dragged on but at about 6:15 who showed up? That exact man. He walked through the doors and I glanced over to Kenny who shot me a look from the deli. The man slapped his palms on the counter and hunched in as he asked

""No sir, ""the deli closes at 6 in the summer, but you're welcome to come back tomorrow for lunch or get ice cream now.""

He let out a wheezy laugh
Kenny was still eyeing the guy as I served him an ice cream,"" he mumbled. 

""It's all home-made

""Yer bosses here? Y'know, kinda the trailer-park type with dirt on his jeans and hands and sweat in his beard. 

""Nope,"" I swiftly moved into the dipping cabinet to occupy myself with scraping down ice cream. I was sure he was just a summer traveler and creeper, but what else could he do when there were customers sitting outside eating? I felt pretty safe with people around, but as I leaned into the cabinet, I saw him loom over me from the other side of the glass. Watching me. For a good 5 minutes. It got even weirder when he asked in a lower voice, ""You know they make roadkill ice cream down south?"" He laughed that ugly, wheezy laugh and said
I didn't respond
He continued to watch me.
""What time you open until?"" he asked
""Nine."" I responded curtly. Was I creeped out? You bet!
I noped out of there and busied myself in the back kitchen with dishes and eventually the guy left. I heaved a sigh of relief, I'm calling Carl and Irene.""

7 rolls around, still no sign of the man. Finally it's 9:12 PM and I serve my last customers. The second they leave, Kenny locks the front doors and we begin our closing routine; he covers the ice cream while I sweep. Our bosses weren't coming back to check on the shop until 11 so we were by ourselves...or so we thought.
Kenny was running the dishes in the back while I wiped everything down when I saw headlights pulling up. Figuring the late customers would see we were closed, I NEED to talk to your bosses! Are they back yet?!""

I called back to Kenny who had heard the ruckus and approached the doors and confronted the man, saying he ""needed"" to see Carl before tomorrow and how he ""knew they were back there."" Kenny shooed the man away, locked the doors and turned to me and muttered, ""Fucking weirdo."" I asked if he'd call Carl and he said it probably wasn't worth it at this time of night since they'd be home soon.

At this point
Whipping around, like in a bathroom stall. He takes the knife and starts jabbing it through the screen and tearing it open. ""Tell that little shit to come back out here and we'll talk like men!"" This psycho was coming into the shop. With a fucking knife. His first foot kicked through and stepped onto the tile. I was practically in tears when Kenny screamed for me to run into the back, so I high-tailed it all the way through the kitchen and into the back office connecting directly to the kitchen, separated by a thick door with a deadbolt. We lock the door and I crumble to my knees, crying, as Kenny calls 911. The man had gotten through the screen door, but we heard him rummaging in the front of the shop. The man was cackling that ""we weren't being very kind treating a customer like this

After about 5 minutes
Turns out, but my bosses didn't stay open after 7 for the next two weeks in fear that the man would come back. He never came back. 
After that, well, ACTUALLY a door.

Kenny and I both still work at the shop and sometimes joke about the crazy man

1335558824.0,svtsq,College Party Vampire,imafluffybunneh,176,30,53,"This happened to me back when I was in college. I went with a group of friends to a house party off-campus. One person in our group knew the owners of the house but other than that the only people we knew there were each other. I was one of two designated ""moms"" (sober people) responsible for taking care of everyone else as they drank themselves into a stupor.

I danced with some of my friends for a while but later on in the night I was sick of having various mixed drinks spilled on me and it was too hot in the basement so I went upstairs for some air. I went out onto the porch and sat on the railing when I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I turned around and saw a guy I'd never seen before. He was really cute

He introduced himself as Luis and told me he thought I was the most beautiful girl he'd seen, sweaty mess. We danced together for a bit to some crappy college party songs.

He started kissing my neck, but it isn't every day an attractive guy wants to kiss you, so I let it happen. Besides, the party was loud and crowded so he probably wouldn't have been able to hear a word I said. I let it go on for a bit and looked around for my friends. I saw my friend Rob out of the corner of my eye, and it was a good thing, too.

Luis had progressed from kissing my neck to biting it. Not nibbling, then worked my way back to where I had seen Rob. He was standing there with a drink in his hand and I shouted at him to dance with me.

He knew something was wrong so he obliged

Standing in the bathroom I checked out the damage to my neck. It wasn't terrible, and left the bathroom. As we left I came face-to-face with Luis, who seemed pissed.

""Who is this?"" he asked, and I told him gently that of course I remembered his name. I assumed he had too much to drink and asked if he was alright. ""I'm sober,"" he insisted. He had this weird crazy eyes thing going on that creeped me out a bit; he obviously had something wrong with him, and I told him I was going downstairs to be with my friends now. He grabbed my wrists and pushed me against the wall. ""You're staying with me,"" he said. He was quite a bit bigger than me and he was hurting me with the force he was using to hold me in place. Rob had wandered drunkenly downstairs without me around the same time Luis had popped up and everyone around us was too drunk to notice or care what was going on. I just nodded and said ""I'm not going anywhere, you're hurting me, please let go.""

He eased up a bit and then insisted that I didn't remember his name. I reminded him again that I remembered his name and then tried to slide my hands away from him. He let it happen but wrapped his arm around my waist so tightly I couldn't get away (in the morning I checked and found four fingertip-sized bruises on my stomach where he had pressed them into me. My wrists ended up bruised too, who I knew would be sober and could help me out.

Luis pulled me outside back onto the porch. He held me against the railing again and started pulling the neck of my tank top down. I told him as sternly as I could to stop but he squeezed my wrists harder behind my back and told me to shut up or he would hurt me. He ducked his head down and bit into my breast

She marched over and tapped Luis's shoulder. ""My friend needs to leave now, half carrying me out the door and down to the street with our friends. I was so thankful. We made our rounds getting all our friends home and safely put to bed, and then she and I went up to my room. She helped me wash off the places he had bitten me with water and antibacterial soap and then sat in my bed with me until I fell asleep.

I moved into my new house with my Mom and two younger brothers in the winter of 2000
Everything went fine for almost two years, but knew nothing of my brothers (he called them Jack and Tom, which weren't their names at all). He would invite me into his house for cookies or to watch movies, but I always declined.

When I was twelve, Bill was out waiting for me and tried to urge me to call the police from his phone. I felt really weird and told him that I would call from mine. As soon as I walked into my house I saw my dog run down the stairs to greet me. I told my mom and she called the police for the first time. They said there was nothing they could do and told me to stay inside from now on.

He scared me so much that I moved across the state to live with my dad for a year. I decided to go to high school at my mom's, even though he knew we couldn't be together. I alerted the police again. This time they told me that he seemed a little off, but in Pennsylvania there's no such thing as a restraining order. We have Protections from Abuse, and they're only valid for a lover or a family member. The police officer said to my mom, right in front of me, ""It would have been better if she had been raped. We could do something about it then.""

My family moved that night, my mom and stepdad followed him back to my original town, on the phone with the police the entire way.

I decided that I was being paranoid. I'm sitting on the couch with a baseball bat in one hand, and a gun within reach. Yeah, it's time to lay off the scary stories. ""He's just at a friend's house. People make friends all the time. Just go to bed and forget about all this.""

I looked through the window, flung open the door and leapt outside. Something whizzed around the caravan and I gave chase, but found nothing.

I returned to the caravan shaking with adrenaline. I sat down and for the third time heard a knock at the door. looking towards the door I noticed the handle to the venetian blind was shaking.

It was the afternoon and my boyfriend had gotten off of work a bit earlier than usual, then asked if my boyfriend knew which unit his cousin lived in. Jamal seemed a bit off, but appeared to be harmless enough. 

Of course my boyfriend had no idea who Jamal's cousin was or where he lived (It's a pretty big complex), and he complied. He ended up getting in contact with the cousin, who promised to pick up Jamal in a few hours when he got off of work. Jamal then thanked him and wandered off, and my boyfriend thought nothing more of the encounter.

Later that day, the local news websites were buzzing about a double murder and child abduction on Christmas Eve. The story especially piqued my interest since it happened only a couple of blocks from where my boyfriend lived, so I told him about it and showed him a picture of the suspect. He went silent, and then stared off into space. Concerned, I asked him what was wrong.

He said he recognized that man; it was Jamal and that the very next day after their encounter, we learned that Jamal had just been released from prison the day my boyfriend found him wandering around the condo complex, had a long criminal rap sheet, and had gone to his victims' house Christmas Eve in search for [drug money, but ended up killing them instead](http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-neighbors-friends-shed-light-on-church-hill-murder-victims-20111225,0,3009554.story).

The food giveaways generally catered to around 70-100 people depending on how many signed up that Friday. For the most part the people were fairly decent. Just people down on their luck needing some help. Every once in awhile you would get some rift raft. 

The food giveaways went in the same order. The people would all lineup and signup. During the signup, size of family, etc. After the signup they would let people into the room and give a 20-30 minute optional sermon to listen to, as all of us volunteers would pack their food. Then, after the sermon, we would call out their names one by one and pass out their bags. 

One Friday, so we decided to sit and listen to the rest of the sermon with everybody else. Now, this room is fairly packed on seating, so they had a couple of benches lined against the wall, facing sideways toward the crowd.

While listening, while listening I noticed he had been staring directly at me a lot. It gave me the creeps, but I tried my best to ignore him. At one point I looked at him and he made his fingers into a v shape and put it up to his mouth and began moving his tongue in and out and moving it in circles. I had no idea what it meant and was really confused. I elbowed my mom to get her to look at him and when she looked over he abruptly stopped. This went on through the rest of the sermon. 

He gave me the creeps, but 13 year old me didn't want to make a scene and tell my mom. I just walked to the volunteers hidden bathroom and sat in there the rest of the time.

I wish I could say this is the end of my story, the description I gave them matched a local sex offender. Even though he was stalking me, the police said they couldn't do anything because I didn't have any proof.

He continued to stalk me. One particular day though, but as I was walking toward his car, as casually as I could, he ran up and started cursing at me. He started telling me how much of a bitch I was and telling me all he wanted was for us to be friends. Luckily my club leader made it outside and yelled toward him to get away from me.

At this point my boyfriend got a bright idea. The apartment complex was gated and only had 4 apartments in it. There was a storage room for all the tenants to use and he thought it was extremely unlikely that anyone would go in it late at night. We spent several minutes discussing this possibility in the courtyard. The entrance to the storage room was directly from the courtyard and all the apartments looked out over the courtyard.

We went into the storage room and started doing our thing. I was straddling him while he sat on a back seat from a minivan. Suddenly I look up and see this middle aged white guy in a cowboy hat staring at us. He had come in silently. I screamed and my boyfriend looked behind him.

I thought such a place may be privy to squatters, so would be wary and scan that area before walking to my door. 

  One night, who would know what time I'd be home and would sometimes show up to try and reconcile. I didn't walk to the door, but rather texted him and asked if he was at the door. He quickly replied that he wasn't, and that I should call the police. By then, the knob had stopped moving and I gathered the courage to walk to the window, 911 dialed into my phone and pepper spray in the other hand. I didn't see anything and assumed that it was probably a confused drunk and decided to shake it off. I installed a chain lock on my door the very next day, just in case.

  Nothing obviously out of the ordinary occurred until weeks later, and directly in front of it was a dark figure hunched up, seemingly staring down at the doorknob. I gasped and looked on in a confused shock for a few seconds before getting away from the window and telling this new boyfriend of mine that there was someone standing at the door. He assumed I was playing a prank on him and didn't get up to check without a minute of incessant prodding. By the time he'd gotten up, the figure was gone and we again assumed it was a silly drunk. 

   Nights later, and he froze as well. We turned off the tv so the person could no longer see inside, and witnessed a shadow walking away by the contrast of the outside lights visible through the tiny gaps between the blinds. 

   The next day, probably terrifying many passers-by. Idiot that I am, I'd sometimes even climb the tree in front of my apartment and keep watch in the dark during the times he would come around, just to catch him the act and get a good description for the police. 

   Some days went by without any action and I found myself walking home from the bus stop at 1 am as usual. I could see my building through the gate on the street I was walking on and my heart stopped when I saw that dark figure hunched in front of my door again (I was at probably 100 feet distance). I had to go around a corner onto the street up ahead in order to enter the complex, I tiptoed around the corner, heart pounding, ready to spray, to find no one at my door and no one around. I knew someone had been there for sure, because my 3 cats were all at the window next to the door already, and they would do that whenever they heard someone at the door. I entered my apartment and the dog seemed to be excited

   Later that night, I thought, ""He's going to try to get me."" The window did not break and I heard a loud ""Sorry!"" as I saw a shadow stagger away and found myself suddenly ducked on the floor, phone in hand, dog barking away. I felt dumb for mistaking a clumsy drunk for the perpetrator this time and was skeptical with further incidents.

   Things stayed quiet for a while again, entered my bedroom, and layed down next to him, back to watching tv. Not 2 minutes later, there was a shadow at the window, very close, hunching over to look inside. My boyfriend was awake at this point and saw it, ""WHAT IT DOOOOO!!!"" and the shadow ran off. The next morning

  It scared me that I had just been outside with this person and that they must have seen me out there to come to my window right after, and trying to make my return times more erratic to throw him off. The sound of my cats jumping to and from the window sill would wake me up all through the nights. I became paranoid and hyper-aware of every sound in the night, every person walking past my door. I sort of got the sense that I might be overreacting if I called the police, assumed there was nothing they could do if I called them, and didn't want to show my fear by having them come by. I began to stay at my boyfriend's house some nights when I felt I couldn't handle the tension, but had to return often to care for my cats and dog and pick up belongings. I so terribly wanted to stay home with my pets and to live life without that paranoia of someone watching me, and I would try to go about life normally most days. Sometimes I'd see the shadow at the window or hear tapping as I was drifting in and out of sleep, but most days I just became numb to the fear and convinced myself these were isolated incidents

  Things remained mild for a while, not even looking for anything unusual at this point. The next day would be my first day returning to work since attending to my boyfriend and I was coming in earlier than usual. When I came in, my coworkers were surprised to see me and asked why I had decided to come in. Apparently, a male voice had called earlier, providing my first and last name and saying that I wouldn't be making it into work that day, supplying no explanation and hanging up. A close friend of mine had been the one to answer the phone and told me how she found it unusual since she didn't recognize the voice as my boyfriend's or my brother's, the only two males I could fathom ever calling with my name. I called them just in case

  I never did find out who called or why, I really should have just called the police to get these incidents on record and to show that I was aware that he was out there. I wonder how many times he had seen me through the gaps in those annoying vertical blinds without my being aware, walking around naked, sleeping, enjoying false privacy, and it just feels disgusting. Was he stealing my mail? Keeping track of my work schedule? Plotting something weird? There were just too many weird happenings for them all to be isolated incidents. Maybe I've read too many creepy anecdotes and serial killer biographies, but I do feel as if I could have been in danger and was a pretty good target for a first victim of some demented creep in the infancy of his perverted career.

A fun fall day turns to night

Now

Pretty much the whole jist of things is to park on this fairly thin bridge called old foamy in the middle of the night, so that just fueld the fire. Oh ya, the windows should be rolled down too. Piece of cake right? WRONG.

After doing said ""Ritual"" the beast labeled ""Old Foamy""(The name the beast received from the bridge witch make the water foam up when water rolls through it) is suppost to appear

So me and four others pile into my little car and we head off. We arrive there thinking no goat man would ever appear. Stopped, and honked three times.

Then, we'd hear stuff going down.) While waiting we hear a crunch in the leaves to our left, I put my hand on the key preparing to start the car(just in case). Then we hear rustling to the right. While being completely distracted we look up and I happen to catch a glance in the rearview a figure, a person, but in the most fucked up mask i've ever seen. Not that it was gory, but a fucking cow skull. 

Instentaniously I try and start the car, put it in drive and get the hell out of there, but as were pulling away, there were more to the sides of us, 3 on the left that I saw and Chris said he saw 2 more on the right. All with hoods except Mr. Cow skull behind. All staring and waiting as we hauled out of there.

Later did we know that there was more behind that place then a 7 foot goat man. Apperently

That was truly the scariest moment of my life

As I got used to the atmosphere of the restaurant/bar, and I'm not an asshole so I tried to laugh and be friendly. But one of my male coworkers gave me the creeps, and it just so happened that he was now my manager. I don't know why he gave me that vibe, but he definitely did. 

The first time I ever closed by myself, and I was totally freaked out. He was trying to sweet talk me, and I was having none of this shit. I told him I had a boyfriend, I was only 16, anything I could think of that would deter him. He was like, 'don't worry, i won't tell your daddy.' It was so intensely creepy. 

I managed to finish my side work and leave

I felt a lot better, and has kids and stuff. I wasn't trying to get him fired. Work progresses as usual for a few weeks, and then one night when I leave work, I notice a car following me. I notice because it's fucking 4am, and there are NO other cars on the road. I am immediately creeped out when the car doesn't turn off and keeps tailing me for a good 10 minutes. I decide not to drive home, and turn off the freeway into a maze of dirt roads. I figure I'll park in an orange grove for 10 minutes and then drive home like a bat out of hell when I shake this guy. I was terrified out of my mind because I watch too many scary movies, so I had already called my mom and boyfriend freaking out. They told me that I should drive straight to the police station, and there was the fucking car! I could see the driver's silhouette

I drove to the station, parked in an empty lot. I ran inside, all shaky and a mess. I told the front desk officer what happened, and she went to the window and saw that the car was still there. Another officer went out to talk to the driver, and to tell them to leave me the fuck alone. 

When he came back, from work. He was just following me to make sure I got home safely. I couldn't fucking believe it. I told them something wasn't right, and he gave me the absolute creeps. I was told to report any more sexual harassment, but that they couldn't do much. I got a police escort home, to make sure he wouldn't follow any more. Now I knew that he drove a silver Ford Explorer, and you bet I'd be on the lookout.

I started to see his car drive past my house multiple times a day. If I was on the computer by the window, I was paranoid, I was shaken up after what had happened. But I knew it was him.

This happened back in 1997 when I was ten years old but I'll do my best to recall it accurately. For the record

A little backstory: We lived on a main road. Our house had no fence at the front of the property, it was a safe neighbourhood. So although our house was ground level and relatively exposed, we never really had any reason to feel threatened.

It's funny how sometimes you can remember strange details about incidents you find to be traumatic. The night this took place

Okay

I remember immediately feeling a sinking feeling in my stomach. Something was not right. I looked over to the corner of my room where my desk was located. It was very dark but I could see a man sitting on my desk chair. Not facing the desk. The chair was turned around to face me. He was in my room

At first I thought I was sleeping (though it felt VERY real) so I started pinching myself under the blanket. 

Nope. Not sleeping. 

Using my amazing kid-logic

As soon as the room was fully lit and I hadn't heard any noises in a while, that sometimes nightmares can feel very real and then dismissed it.

I really didn't want to go back to my room but I reluctantly returned and started packing my school bag. I looked up to grab my homework book. Not only was my chair pulled out and turned around but my homework book was on my desk. I knew this probably wouldn't be enough evidence for my parents so I had an internal freak out and continued getting ready for school.

Fast forward about twenty minutes and my parents approach me with very pale faces. 

They had gone to go and hang out the laundry (walking from the laundry room to the backyard required walking past the outside of my bedroom) and on passing my window

I wish I could say we noped the fuck out of that house but we lived there for probably 6 more years. My parents eventually had a huge wall erected out front as well as security cameras. I honestly can't remember if my parents went to the police or not (I know

I guess the moral of the story is to always lock your windows.

UPDATE: I asked my parents about this yesterday. My Mum said that they made a ""discreet inquiry"" to the police so as not to frighten me and the police informed them that they had several similar reports in the area, bought a big dog and checked on me multiple times every night for a good year or thereabouts.

As a Sophomore in college

My name's Brandon, and an overall big guy. I wear mostly black, I have long hair, and if you couldn't put two and two together, I love Metal and Horror movies. I have no major fears, except for a floor mate named Tori. As silly as it seems for a guy of my stature to be afraid of a girl who is maybe 5' 6"", and 21 years old

It all began this year actually. This year, opposite of the other dorms, is two more rooms for single occupant rooms. Mine is one of them.

After the first few days of class, all was good. Until Tori took notice of me.

It all started with the staring. Whenever I would be outside, reading, studying, or whatever. She stared at me. Needless to say, I was unnerved a bit.

At first

First she would be walking outside my door at all hours, she would just stare. And then eventually, she got to know my friends and whenever she saw them, she would ask about me.

An example of this would be actually what happened last week. My buddy Davide (his name, lighter and cigar, she comes out of her room in her pajamas and walks outside to sit with Davide. She said she wanted to smoke with us. And by that, she meant light the filter of a cigarette and chew on it while staring at me.

My buddy Ryan told me a story about when she lived in his dorm. She apparently tried to seduce (and failed) every guy in her old dorm, screaming at random, and one time she threw herself down a small half flight of stairs.

But what really set it all over was the time I played poker with the Residential Assistant. Me and my RA were playing and out comes Tori. She decides she will be the dealer. So she is dealing the cards, how she can count cards. Each lie was greater than the last. While we were playing, she kept texting and yelling 'Oh my God' after every text. She kept slamming the cards she dealt harder and harder. And finally, she snapped.

She throws herself out of her chair. And by this I mean it looked like someone kicked her in the face and she flew on to the ground. She starts to roll around and scream and cry. She starts wailing 'My life is over!' and 'Oh my God I am stupid!'. She starts hitting the ground and rolling faster

Apparently, and still married but divorcing. She dated him since that morning. And he broke it off with her.

Oh

And now there is an informational poster on what to do if someone has an asthma attack. It is right above the spot she rolled around on.

There was one in particular that was crazy for me...well the persona he believed was me anyway. He would bring dinner to me when he booked me on a night shift

His name was Viktor and he was russian, 'Faith I can show you how to live!' He really was very sweet. 

He had some pretty specific fetishes, we would get down to business, he would beg and plead some more and then he would leave.

Towards the end of my employment there, he was livid, he threw me on the bed and spanked me like I have never been before. He demanded to know who he was and what was going on. I screamed loud enough from the spanking that one of the girls alerted the manager on at the time and she buzzed the speaker in the room.

I explained to Viktor that if I didn't answer straight away that she would come in to make sure everything was alright. He shoved himself away from me and with his back turned to me he undressed. I buzzed back to show that I was alright

We got straight to business and when he was done and dressing

Not being a driver, I arrived home from a friday night shift (7pm to 7am) to find a small package on my doorstep. I took it inside and unwrapped it to find a set of black, nylon stockings- in my size. A simple note was a attached to it saying:

                    I'm sorry.

Arturo got up, where, in terror, they made their bags and prepared to leave immediately.

Along the way to Mexico city, one parking in front and one behind the family's car. They had been followed. Several men exited the vehicles and pointed their AR-15s at the family. They came to honor their word, they came for Ana.

For context, which I was really excited about. Also, I live in England.

When I finished my first year at college I found myself agreeing to every overtime shift that I possibly could. To be precise, or 6pm-10pm every weekday. Sure, I had regular customers (e.g. the drunken tramps of the town, who were always very nice and easy to talk to, despite the smell they emitted) but there was one man who I eventually noticed was coming in every single day, at the same time, sometimes more than once. He was an Indian man, had a receeding hairline

No matter how long my queue of customers was, because that's part of the job really. He seemed to really like talking to me, but then again some elderly people come in just to talk so I dismissed that. I realised something was up when he began asking me, every day, what time I finished that night. I would always tell him that I finished at half eleven at night, by which time the supermarket was shut, just because I usually fear the worst.

My fears were confirmed a month and half or so later when he came to my till as usual, you've lied to me!"" Er, creep alert much? I hate to say this but I was scared so I apologised and mumbled something about being allowed to leave early all of the days which he must of waited. I hated upsetting people, no matter how creepy or weird. I've learnt my lesson now.

On another occasion he asked for my number

After these incidents reoccurring for about two months I told my supervisors who kindly would look out for him, look around for me and perhaps ask someone if I was working, and when he would hear that I wasn't working he would leave without buying anything. Sometimes I'd see him in the supermarket after that but he could never talk to me, because  I would run and hide somewhere in the supermarket. I stopped doing so much overtime shortly after anyway, as I returned to college after the summer to study a new course.

It didn't all end there though. There's only one way to walk into town from my house, suitcases and phone cases that were all generally rather tacky and ugly. I'd never been in this shop, just seen the window displays. This is important later.

I'd always walk home with headphones in, with no headphones in. I could hear someone walking behind me, but out of not wanting to look rude I held my phone up in front of me, like a mirror, to see who was behind me. So sneaky once again! Anyway it was my old friend from the checkout, staring straight at me. He didn't know that I knew he was behind me though.

Despite being five minutes from my house, I quite literally darted into a bush. Peering out of it, I saw him as he turned the corner. He looked around, slightly confused, and then I heard him shout to someone I couldn't I see, ""Where is she? Where did she go?"" To which a man with a similar accent in similarly broken English replied that he didn't know. I hid here for until they walked back past in the direction they'd came then I ran off home.

I never once told my parents that any of this was happening. So

A week later I was packing my suitcase, because it was close to our  house.  Upon entering I saw my old friend ONCE AGAIN. It was his shop! I tried to remain calm, as my parents didn't know about him, and also largely because I was a wimp and somehow had convinced myself it was all a misunderstanding. I avoided further eye contact, pointed out a suitcase to my dad, then told him I was going to wait outside because I was hot.

I was shaking with nerves. Everything made a lot more sense now - he'd know when I was working because in order to get to work, that was the one time I forgot my headphones.

When me and my dad got home I explained everything to him. My dad's pretty scary - he's an ex ""football thug"", and knocked some sense into him"". Whenever I had to go to town for the next week I'd get a lift off one of my parents  or my brother. Then, when we returned from our three week holiday, the shop and flat above it (where he must of lived) was boarded up.

I haven't seen the creepy man since, in the midst of all this, and also I regret not telling anyone sooner. I can't believe I just passed it all off because I didn't want to cause a scene. The police never got involved, most likely because my stalker was highly unlikely to report that he'd been beaten up by my dad for stalking me for around seven months.

Sorry for making it so long, it really does mean a lot.

This was the scariest halloween for my dad, waking up early from an unknown caller that ended up being your daughter two hours away in the ER. 

After that phone call I fell asleep and woke up to my dad in the room crying. 

It turned out that I had stopped breathing a few times that night. The first time was within a half hour of taking that shot.

She was the one who called the ambulance.

Later that day, that I was scared. I had also received a text from him saying he wanted me to go to the bathroom and give him head. I decided to reply to his text and ask him what happened that I had woken up in the hospital. He replied ""that sucks"".

It was the afternoon and I’d gone to pick my sister up from gymnastics because my parents were out of town. Now my town is pretty small

My worry became magnified when they turned their blinker on to follow us down our residential street. Even though people do use the road as a shortcut my chest got tight and I felt sick to my stomach. Despite the anxiety I pulled into my driveway, so she started to get out. I told her to get back in. I cranked the car back up and started to back out. The car pulled out and left. 

I sat in my car and called my mom who called the police. The officer came by and took a statement for a report and told us that we had to be careful because we were “pretty girls.” As if attractiveness had anything to do with it. I felt he wasn’t taking me seriously because I could not logically explain the feeling of dread that I’d had. They patrolled my street that afternoon and that’s all that came of it. A couple of weeks later we heard about a man that knocked on the door of a young girl in town who was home alone and tried to lure her into his car

1347653863.0,zw6n6,Cupcakes and... lubricant?,celery_stalk,179,35,34,"Started creeping here a couple of months ago and fell in love. Originally, I think this is LetsNotMeet worthy."" So I created this account to share. It's long

I'll start by saying I'm a 21 year old female. I just got a new job hostessing at a restaurant in the downtown area of the very large city I live in. Above the restaurant are pretty pricey lofts. On the first floor is where I work, Chipotle, and a bakery; all of which have at least one door near the back of the store that leads to the lobby. When I got the job, I got access to the parking garage that the residents use. From there I can take a backway to the lobby, which leads to one of the doors connected to my job. 

Every day I work, but other than that it's pretty rare. Which is why I thought it was odd when I saw Mike. He's the nightly concierge, looks around late 40's to early 50's, round glasses, short. He was around the bar, scanning the area like he was looking for something. When he saw me, he came over and asked me for some extra promotion cards that we had been handing out to guests so he could give some to the residents. I simply asked my manager for some and gave it to Mike, Mike comes in and gives me four chocolate covered strawberries

A couple of days later I saw Mike again. I was packing a to-go order when he came up and said he had something for me, but was white, and an envelope. Inside the bag was a cupcake, and inside the envelope was two miniature Hershey's chocolate bars. At this point I was beginning to feel too much attention had been placed on myself. I needed to share, after all; sharing is caring, right?! I faked excitement (which I realize I shouldn't have), thanked him, Michelle, so I ended up giving it to Michelle. He hands the cupcake to me, ""Ugh

Finally, ""Hey, did you lose your purse?"" No, I didn't. ""Well.."", and he pulls a small shopping bag out and it's completely full. I didn't really want to look inside, so I kind of skimmed the top. As I was pretending to be interested in the bag, he says, avoiding eye contact. ""Do you want to look at it here or..?"" I tell him no, wipes, toothpaste

After some deep gossip with a girl that's been working there for a couple of years, the one whose shifts I took after she quit. She said he probably just grabbed all of that stuff from gift bags from a party the banquet hall had earlier, not even paying attention to what was in them. But still.. inappropriate. And the 'book' he was writing? Showed her the papers and she said it's straight from a brochure the lofts give new residents about the history of the building. My general manager was thoroughly creeped out as well, and he's a creeper himself. He jokes like, ""He gave you a bottle of lube?! That's inappropriate, I'm going to have to confiscate that, okay?"" He brought up a good point that I hadn't realized, and nobody knew what he put in those. I could be eating semen while he sits at the bar

1328670443.0,pfoqp,Birthday surprises. (NSFW?) ,failright,182,34,14,"Hey
Dad had invited a million and one of his friends, about 20 people hovering over my twin and I and the rest sitting on the couch or still drinking in the dining room.   I should also include that my dad is a domestic abuser, alcoholic, and had used verbal abuse toward my mom too many times to count during my childhood.
The traditional happy birthday song began, so she blew out all the candles.  My sister and I looked at her and that's when it started.  

""Your stupid girl blew out the candles!"" A voice said in Vietnamese
""What did you say?!""  My dad
After that I only remember getting hurried to my room that I shared with 3 other sisters.  All my cousins were crammed through the window my mom opened, which was incoviniently located in the living room with them.  I ran toward, wanting to be with my mom, the open front door and saw my dad ripping the wall phone from her hand and throwing it at the floor.  

Only two of the men there, only 15 minutes away.  We got into the house, locked the doors, checked if everyone was alright, and separated my 6 sisters and I to try to sleep the event off for the time being.  
Almost everyone slept together on the floor of their living room with their moms when my cousin's mom came in and said that my older cousin (let's call him Mike who is about 15) had decided to share with one person.  My mom volunteered my twin
The whole room suddenly stopped for a second
I don't know what got into me, because I still get the shivers around him to this day. 
 
We went to his room, he was basically spooning with me.) Being the innocent kid I was, I just thought that this was normal. 
Then I felt a hand.  It was in an ordinary place; it was on my stomach.   But then he pulled me closer,with all the intelligence a five year old could have, what the fuck he was doing.
I tried to scoot away from him
I jumped up, who was one her knees with her head down, begging for forgiveness in Vietnamese while crying. 

Mike's mom saw me and grabbed me to huddle with the rest of the kids on the couch
My boss of a grandma bravely went to the wall phone she had, the police arrived and arrested him by force.
You'd think that my mom would divorce him and let him rot in prison after that, and then proceeded to let him LIVE back with us.

1376302821.0,1k76f3,You don't love me,livinfreeneasy,187,42,21,"this is a long one. I haven't really told anyone how badly this has affected me. 

A couple of years ago I dated this guy named Joey. I had just gotten out of a relationship a few months earlier with a guy because of lack of interest with each other. we had just gotten bored with it idk when your 21 you don't make good choices most of the time. 

ANYWHO. I met Joey on FB and after two days of texting each other he can basically describe me down to my fucking favorite type of socks. he was always really good at figuring people out. Joey was a bigger guy. . . the kind of guy you see in movies who start the bar fights. i was drawn in and enjoyed his company. he was like a teddy bear to me

Joey asked me to move in with him on week4. I was love struck by how nice he was. He had the best stories and would keep me entertained and distracted even in my worst mood. it was rushed to me but i was in the moment and agreed. so a week later i moved all my things into his house. 

Joey lived with his mother and step father. He took care of them with the money he made as a tattoo artist. his mother had a bad leg and worked at a laundry mat ""under the table"" so she could get her gov. check too. everything seemed great that first week. like i found a guy who really understood my oddness and could make me smile. 

it wasnt until the second week i started noticing small changes in his attitude. Joey would only go to work when i did. i worked at a grocery store and worked night shifts so i thought nothing of it at first. he said he was great at his job and people made appointments to fit his needs so he could work like that. so i never had a moment when i got off work that he wasnt there. He was always there. 

Soon it became a habit at night for him to beg me to lay on his chest and run my fingers through his chest hair. i thought it was sweet at first. until he got very upset with me the moment i seemed tired of it. it got to a point to where he would make me stay on his chest until he fell asleep. i felt like maybe i was a bad girlfriend by not wanting to indulge him so i didn't press the matter. 

Joey started dropping me off and picking me up from work. he would spend the last 20 minutes of my shift bagging groceries and making conversation with everyone. everyone loved Joey. He was just so damn smooth with words you couldn't help but enjoy the conversation. people thought it was romantic of him to want to be with me. i thought it was at first. then i got aggravated when he down right refused to let me drive myself to work. 

3 weeks into our relationship living together Joey made it clear he wanted me to delete every picture i had of my ex. of any ex. of any boy on my computer. in fact he wanted me to delete my fb delete all men from my phone and not talk to any of them at all. most of my friends are male. ive always had a hard time getting along with girls and the only girl i do hang out with is a butch lesbian. his reasoning was ""i love you so much i dont want to talk to anyone else. why would you?"" i felt like this is probably what ruined my last relationship. so i tried it. i kept conversations with males to a very min. my only friends who could come over were sarah and nathan (both who were gay) 

a week passes and Joey starts to question my friendship with sarah. its become quite clear to him that we are sneaking around his back and making out the 2 minutes were not in the same room as him. im obviously a cheating lying scumbag for doing so. the fights start at this point. the constant accusations and no trust from him at all. 

now at this point i should have left. hell i should have never went in the first place. he was just too smooth about it all. I never had to cook clean or anything. when i got off work he had dinner already made. he had a bowl packed a movie we'd like to watch and an ear to hear my problems. he seemed like such a great guy. i felt ungrateful for feeling like he was trying to keep me locked away. it was a MINDFUCK. 

4 months pass and my life is a bird  stuck in a cage. i never go out anymore. sarah hardly visits for fear of joey's eyes. things dont add up. all these things i thought i knew about him start to seem more like a lie every day. whenever i got even 5 mins alone with joeys mom i would try to hint at what i was worried about. but she always backed up everything he said. i cant talk to anyone on my phone now. 3 messages or more and that qualified as a ""conversation"" and that wasnt allowed. i was in fear now. his small threats of dominance loomed over me. hinting at what he could do if i tried to leave him. i was scared to sleep most nights and ended up staring at his chest moving. sometimes i would start a fight to see if i could make him not want me. i would scream and cry and just be a bitch to get out of the house. but he always used his words against me. making me feel weak. something i've NEVER allowed. i still dont know why i was such a coward to him. sure he was twice my size

one night a local band i like is playing at a bar. i ask joey if we can go and he astonishingly says he'd love to. we go and by surprise a big group of my friends i hadnt seen in 4 months had decided to go too. i try not to make it too obvious that im happy to see them. i dont want joey to push them away. i always stay a bit distant but try to talk to them as much as possible at the same time. we ended up leaving after only an hour of being there. Joey didnt want me talking to todd

the next day todd calls me and asks me to hang out for a couple of hours and see his new apartment. i ask joey if its okay. his expression is of complete shock. why would i want to go see a man with out him? i cant help but break. please. let me go see him. joey looks at me as if im pathetic. he says ""you can go but your shit will be on the porch when you get back"" 

THANK GOD. ""If thats the case i'll take my stuff right now"" 

the look on his face wont leave my mind. he woudlnt let me touch any of my things and he packs my car for me. i say ""im sorry"" and he says ""no your not"" and slams his door. i hear things breaking inside and i just GTFO. 

days later i have to get my tax refund from his house. his mother called me and told me it was there and that she wouldnt say i was there (joey never left the back bedroom when his step father was home) i walk inside and cant help but shake and cry silently as i see her face. she knows what i went through. 

i find out later that joey had threatened his mother to back up what ever story he told me. that he had hit his wife and thats why she had left. he never had a job he never left the house. he took his mothers gov. check. i never saw his face again after i left. but he still sends me messages on fb. always a new profile when i block him. asking me to come back and that he is so sorry. 

it took me half a year to get to sleep. i dont know if i could ever see him again with out breaking down. he looms over me in my dreams sometimes. i think about what if i didnt get out?  sometimes the right guy can be so . SO wrong.

This is not my story personally but my mothers. It has been a while since she told me this story so please forgive me if I get some details wrong. 

This was when my mother was in College in Illinois probably in the early 70’s. Anyways my mother was at the grocery store. The store had these huge windows looking out on the parking lot and you could see pretty much everything that happened out there. While she was waiting in line she saw two very attractive girls in front of her. The way my mother describes it they were tall thin

The girls were in front of her checking out when Brunette of pointed out the window and said

Blondie commented back something along the lines of

Something about the way my mom told this story made it seem like perhaps the guy outside was Blondie’s boyfriend or ex-boyfriend

The girls walk across the cross walk right in front of the guys car. He revved his car and hits her knocking Blondie down and partially running her over. By now people are noticing and the guy starts to back up but Blondie’s long
The whole time people are panicking and yelling at him to stop and her friend is trying to help her up. Since this was before cell phones people are trying to get the police called on the stores phone. The girl apparently ended up being alright. Hurt but nothing major just broken bones and a messed up scalp. 

My mother told me this story as a warning. If you think someone may hurt you contact the police immediately. Take all precautions. Even if you’re unsure or if you get that feeling something is off. 

I’ve read a lot of these stories and it seems like the people we hear from followed their instincts and played it safe which is what saved them. You may seem like a jerk or a weirdo for freaking out at the time but just remember if that girl had waited inside or called the police she wouldn’t have had this happen.

1376204163.0,1k4tp1,Working nights alone can be super scary.,mega_nogen,169,25,18," After the other day when ""The Smiling Man"" post hit the front page

I've been working nights for the last four years now, but I don't really believe in all that. It's mostly just getting freaked out by a creaky old building.
Anyways, I'm in the back of the house just baking and doing my thing.

So one night, and trying not psych myself out about ghost stories and whatnot. I was working out of the smaller oven which mostly is concealed from the front doors and windows by a massive cooling rack. It's not uncommon for your managers to show up unannounced because we do work by ourselves, and they want to make sure we stay productive throughout our shifts. So when I heard the sound of the door attempting to be opened, I didn't think much of it. Until a second later when it stopped and I didn't hear anything else.
Glancing out around the rack, I still get a little scared someone is going to try and break into my store one night. As a single lady working nights, you learn to be a little paranoid.

So... moving on, and he's looking down at something in his hands. Yeah, it startled me, but there's a bar across the complex I work in and it just closed. I assume he walked over drunk and is on his phone or something. 
As per company policy, we've been told it's a liability for the company in case that person gets robbed or hurt or whatever. So, I'm thinking, ""Alright. If he's still there in a little while, I'll call.""
I don't want to be a dick and call the cops on someone waiting for a cab
That was when he turned and looked up at me. He motioned for me to come to the window in front of where he was. I stood sort of frozen for a moment and then shook my head at him and walked to the back of house where I couldn't be seen.

I'm not going to say it didn't creep me out- it really did. But worthy of losing my mind over it? No. So I started to bake again and told myself it was just a drunk dude
A couple minutes later though, hoping he would leave on his own. 
At this point, drunk or not. And after working nights this long, you learn quick that there is absolutely nothing anyone needs to say to you in an isolated area at two in the morning. 

After a moment, and that I should keep him posted. I checked to make sure the alarm was set, and tried to avoid front of house as much as possible. 

It was quiet for a while after that. I checked a couple of times to see if he was out front
I went to go work in the small ovens again
Only this time it was really fucking loud. Insistent and angry. 
So I did what any normal person would do
I went to reach for my phone to call the cops and realized it was charging at the other end of the cafe. I couldn't get to it without being seen because the entire front of the store is made up of huge windows. Right as I made these connections

So, really, to calm myself down. I run through my options. 
The first thing I decide, ducking the entire way, and get to it. I quickly call 911, fill in the operator, and then I call my manager who tells me he will be there as soon as he can.

This is about the point where all of my ovens decided to start going off. So thinking it would be good to avoid a giant fire in my cafe, and sure enough, when I look directly behind me, he's fucking standing there with his hands cupped against the glass, and he's looking at me through the glass. 
That's when I noped the fuck out

After a few minutes, gave my statement, and they told me they had checked around the entire cafe, but hadn't seen anyone. They did tell me however, that all of the tables and chairs were knocked over out front. I let them know my manager was on his way, and they left asking me to call them if anything happened again. Unfortunately there wasn't much else they could do. I saw them hang out for a while, and they left a little later with their sirens on again.

My manager finally showed up and helped me finish the bake while I told him everything that happened. The opening manager came in and asked about the patio. It was a pretty uneventful finish to a pretty scary shift.

 It was so terrifying to think about afterwards

1369324876.0,1ewr2r,Footsteps on the Roof,uhuhshesaid,172,27,14,"A few years ago I was back home visiting my family. We had an nice older house with a large square living room. That night my mom was out of town and so it was me (female)

We were having a great time hanging out and catching up with each other. We weren't drinking/smoking anything

We all stopped what we were doing and shared that creepy silent ""shit has gotten real"" look that adults tend to get when shit has

My younger brother, thrust the phone at me. I talked to the dispatcher, told her we had all heard footsteps across our roof, and clearly this person wanted us to know they was there. It might also be worth mentioning that our roof is quite large across the living room portion and whoever it was only took only 4 steps to get across it-- so we don't feel like this is just a kid playing a prank. 

She tells us to make sure everything is locked up (of course it's not and that is a terrifying ordeal to run to all the windows and doors). Half of me wanted to peer out and the other half was terrified of what I could see. We opted to shut the curtains and waited for the police to show. They came and saw that our ladder had been taken out of the shed (should've locked that shit up) and used to get up on the roof. On the other side (where the footsteps had ended) the rose bushes were trampled as if someone had jumped down on them. 

Nothing else was heard for the rest of the night. But we all had a slumber party in the living room

A few months later (not related) my mom sold the house and moved into a condo. I have to say

1344916374.0,y6nlq,There's a crazy clown in the house.,SwillFish,163,17,27,"I've posted this story once before in a lot less detail in a different thread

About two years prior, it had a really unconventional floor plan. There was a central living room and kitchen like any normal home, but the three bedrooms were more akin to separate apartments. Each had its own separate outside entrance, a private bathroom, and a door that led to the common area living room and kitchen. Perhaps the place was originally intended to be a boarding house or something? I really don't know. The other thing that was a little creepy about the house was that is was all wood. The ceilings, walls and floors were all brown and nothing was ever painted or plastered.

My dad was a pretty cool guy. While he was waiting for permits and financing

Eventually two of my friends moved out

I'm at home one afternoon when the phone rings. It's my buddy and he sounds terrified. He tells me to call the police and to meet him out in front of the driveway of the house, and he tells me that there is a crazy clown in the house.  Apparently, he was sick with the flu in bed for the previous two days. When he finally felt well enough to go into the kitchen to get something to eat, he runs face to face with a crazy woman dressed in a clown suit and make-up who starts screaming at him. It was then that he ran out of the house and called me in a panic from a nearby gas station. 

I call the police and then drive over to the house which was about two miles away. I find my buddy on the sidewalk out front and he's really shaken up. I ask him to describe what he saw and he keeps saying that there is a crazy clown woman in the house. I ask for more specific details and he describes her as dressed in a white clown suit with red makeup smeared all over her face. He is still a little sick, he is really freaking me out as well. There was no way in hell that I was going to go into that house to investigate his story.

After what seems like an eternity, brown hair and is wearing this weird, baggy, one piece, all white body jumper suit that is kind of styled like [this outfit](http://magsrags.myshopify.com/products/jeanne-marc-80s-vintage-jumpsuit-retro-futuristic-s-xs). What was really disturbing though is her face. She had a tube of lipstick which she crudely spread red all over her cheeks in a failed attempt I suppose to make them look rosy.

Although we were both freaked out

When he comes back to talk to us, freaks us out even more. Fortunately though, when they run a background check on her, it turns out she has an outstanding warrant and would be going to jail instead. That is the last time we saw her.

When we go back into the house

The really scary thing though was that this crazy woman was in the same house with my friend for at least a day while he was sick and semi delirious in bed with a fever. She was probably harmless

One of the things she wrote on the cabinets in lipstick was her name. While I'm not allowed to disclose it here,False,,t5_2t3t8,1344921982.0,,,t3_y6nlq
1343772348.0,xgzz6,Bloodied Woman Barges In,Injunwerks,197,51,38,"""Prowler at the Window"" was not only my first post here

Strange as it was, it isn't a place where I would want to raise a family in today's world. Back then was a more innocent time. My memories of the bottom are both sweet and sour, but it was familiar. It was home.

Still

This particular incident happened just after school had let out for the summer vacation. It would have been early to mid-June of 77 or 78. I would have been 9 or 10 years old at this time. Of course it was raining. It was a steady but moderate downpour. My grandfather would have called it a “toad floater.” It got dark early because of the storm clouds

In those days before cable television

Our property was bordered on the south side by FM2797 that stopped in a dead end about a quarter mile past our house. At the southwest corner of our land was the entrance to Plaza Drive, someone either entering or leaving the bottom would try to take that corner too fast and would end up either stuck in the field or (if I was lucky) they would actually get sideways in the turn and would roll their car if they were going fast enough. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t want to see people get hurt, but it was always great fun to watch the tow truck come out and roll the car back onto its wheels and then haul it off. The tow truck driver would normally pick up any of the larger objects that fell out of the car, but they were never diligent about it. I would go over to the corner after the tow truck was gone and look for whatever they’d missed or just not taken the time to retrieve. My main reason for the search was for change that may have fallen out. This meant an extra candy bar to split with my brother (Mom always made me share) or a new Hot Wheel. There was always something left behind, a shoe, a hairbrush, etc. I found a box of bullets one. Another time I found a Hustler magazine that opened up a whole new world to me. So a car wreck at the corner was always a cause for excitement. 

On this particular night, it turned into a paste that sucked at your tires and left ruts, but the road had been built up over the years so the water would run off it before it had a chance to soak in. This resulted in a rounded road more than a flat road, which was fine when it was dry but more difficult to navigate when wet. 

“I don’t know who it is. It sure is loud, “He knows there’s kids here.”

I told her that he was going way too fast. By now, the tail lights lit up. As I watched, the lights lifted a little in the air as the front brakes brought the nose down and then suddenly, the those brake lights went about ten feet into the air and disappeared. Then I saw one of the head lights and then the brake lights again, rolling over each other in the rain. It finally came to a stop on one of the sides but I couldn’t tell which side. As I was watching and was taking all of this in, my mother half shouted “Good Lord, what was that?” She’d heard the booms and crunches. She came running over to me wiping her hands with a dishrag. 

She came up behind me and looked out the window and as we both watched

Mom called the police and was telling them what happened and where to go. I was watching the truck. I couldn’t really see anything but that one tail light and the head lights shining on the weeds in front of it. I was watching to see if someone was going to crawl out but never saw anyone. 

As I was watching the truck

She was skinny with big boobs. That was all I noticed at first; being the curious

Then I saw the blood. Her whole head was covered in blood. Her hair that I initially thought was brown was actually blonde but bloody. It was a short

She was wearing black pants and a light blue button shirt that had a frilly lace collar. A waitress uniform I realized when I saw the name tag. It had one corner broken off and was hanging at an angle with blood staining her shirt behind it. One leg of the black pants was ripped from about mid-thigh down to below her knee and I could see bits of a bloody leg. She had blue kicks that were the same color as her shirt

As I was drinking all of this in, but never stopped long enough to let the woman talk. As she got up to get a glass of water for the woman, my father walked in from work. 

He started to ask about the blood all over the door and then saw the woman. Mom looked at him and told him that the police were coming. As dad was talking to mom, it was empty. He wanted to know if there was anything he could do. 

The woman started crying and began telling us about how Billy had beat her. She said that he’d used the small end of a fishing rod and had beat her until she bled. I hissed at this because I could relate. Just the summer before I was riding my bicycle in front of our house and some kids drove by and yelled something at me. My response was to grab a rock and throw it at them. I was pretty handy with a rock, but I meant that I hadn’t done anything to make the kids yell at me. 

I had a white fiberglass whip antenna with a big orange flag mounted on the back of my bike. It was kept in the holder with a screw that was long gone, dad grabbed it and grabbed me by the upper arm and gave me two quick swats. I was wearing shorts and it stung like nothing I’d ever experienced before. Then he made me walk my bicycle back to the barn and put it away. I didn’t need to be having fun on a bicycle if I was going to lie to him. So I knew all about how it felt to get a stripe or two. 

She told dad that her name was Margaret

I could see my dad getting angry because his jaw was tightened up. I looked at Mr. Laird

Margaret went on to say that she kicked him in the balls and tried to run out the door but before she could get outside

They talked for a few more minutes and as my mother continued to clean the blood away

As soon as they walked out the door, but Margaret insisted that her medicine was in the purse and that she needed to take her medicine. My mom is as good as they get, she can be a little backwards sometimes, but she’s not an idiot. Suspicious now, she asked Margaret what medicine she needed. Margaret stalled, it was obvious that she was searching for a suitable answer. Suddenly she looked up and actually had half a smile as she held up a single finger and said “My inhaler! I need my inhaler.” Then almost comically, she lost the smile and slumped in the chair and started breathing in a raspy manner.

My mother, I took advantage of this on more than one occasion. I was a kid; not a saint!

My mother got this worried look on her face; she was obviously torn between leaving me and my brother alone with a strange woman and letting the woman suffer. She looked between Margaret and me and my brother asleep on the sofa and the window and back to Margaret. By this time, the phone rang and I watched as mom talked to the caller. From the tone of her voice, I knew it was my dad. She started to tell him about Margaret going back to the truck, but stopped when he started shouting. I could hear his voice through the tinny speaker all the way across the room. When I looked back to the truck, I couldn’t see Margaret, but I did see the police arrive and I said so to mom. She was finishing the call with a lot of OKs and nods of the head. When she hung up the phone, she went over and locked the door and told me to come away from the window. 

My father and Mr. Laird drove back into sight, lights from the police car and that one tail light on Billy's truck. I could also see two flashlights shining all over the truck and then inside the truck and then into the surrounding trees and bushes. I watched my father run up to the police and I knew he was shouting because both of the flashlights whipped up and over to him. He was pointing back to his car. Then I watched the flashlights start bobbing up and down and back and forth as the policeman went running towards my dad’s car. Then I saw the inside light come on and the flashlight beams shining on two men in the back seat. One of the policemen went back to the police car and sat inside it for a minute and then went back to my dad’s car. Nothing else happened for a long time. Then I heard the sirens.

I watched as a glow of light appeared on top of the hill where FM2797 went to town. First I saw only the bright white light glow of the headlights of a car coming from town and I could hear the siren getting louder and louder and then I saw the red flashes. It was another police car rushing to the scene of the accident. By this time, I could see everything now. There were pulling a man out of the back seat and laying him on the stretcher. My first thought was that Mr. Laird had been hurt, but then I saw him walk around from the other side of the car. I had no idea who was on that stretcher. 

After just a minute or two, a tow truck appeared and I got to watch them pull Billy’s truck back onto its wheels. Then the man moved the tow truck around to the back of Billy’s truck and raised the bed of the truck into the air and then hooked up some more chains and drove away. Billy’s truck looked weird, like it had a big hump in the middle or something. This left my dad and Mr. Laird talking with the police. They were all standing in front of the police car in the rain; the police taking notes on a little pad he pulled from his shirt pocket. Then the police both shook my dad’s hand then Mr. Laird’s and everyone got back into their cars. My father dropped Mr. Laird at his house and then came back home. 

My mother was full of questions and tried start asking them the moment my dad stepped in the door

We were all sitting there waiting when he came and sat with us. He said that Billy’s been shot bad. Three times; once in the leg

He and Mr. Laird went to Billy’s house and when they got there it was a mess. He said that from the way it looked, just across the river from the bottom but you had to drive about twenty miles to get there by car). They’d met at a dance hall. They’d been out a few times and he’d promised to take her some place nice the next time he was home. Billy did oilfield work and made a very good salary, but he drank and partied most of it away each week.

She was evidently waiting for him when he got home this afternoon. Billy told my father that he’d thought it was strange that she was at his house without a car but invited her inside and had just taken a shower and was getting dressed when she attacked him. He’d been bent over to get his boots from under the bed and she hit him with the cast iron frying pan. He said that when he woke up he’d been dragged to the living room and she was trying to tie his feet together with a belt. He said that he kicked her away and got to his feet but was too dizzy and she was going crazy. She kept asking him where his money was. She knew he didn’t trust banks and he’d told her that he always cashed his checks on the way home each Friday. 

He said that he tried to get to his feet and she saw that he was still dizzy and came at him again with the frying pan he was able to fend her off and grabbed her legs and pulled her to the floor when she kicked him in the head. He said that they wrestled around the living room for a minute and she finally got loose and ran to his bedroom and locked the door. He kept a .22 revolver on his nightstand and she grabbed that and shot him in the stomach through the closed door. He said he fell and when she heard him fall she unlocked the door and came out and held the gun to his head and demanded his money. 

Billy said that he grabbed at the gun and she shot him in the shoulder and then while they were both fighting for the gun, she was in the bathroom going through the pockets of his dirty jeans. She’d left the pistol on the bed and he grabbed it and was going to shoot her, but missed because he was using his left hand and was still dizzy. He told her that he was going to kill her and started trying to get out of the zip ties. Molly ran out of the bathroom and he kicked at her, but he heard her run down the stairs and then he heard his truck start. He said he tried to get up, but got dizzy and fell again and the next sound he heard was my father calling his name. 

Margaret or Molly disappeared that night. The police questioned my father the next day to weigh his story and Mr. Lairds story to see if they jived with Billy’s version of the story. Mr. Laird stopped by a few days later and told my father that one of his friends who was on the police force told him that they’d gone to her place of employment

Sorry if this is too long or anti-climactic. This is a vivid memory for me on several levels. I got to actually see a wreck as it happened that night. I got to see an ambulance in action for the first time. We had a dangerous woman barge into our house and drip blood all over the place. I knew someone who got shot. I got to see the scars and bullets. When you’re ten years old

Now who wants to hear about the kid who lived four houses down from me? He was the one who shot his neighbor. I even have a newspaper article about that incident. Let me know…

1356849796.0,15nwqf,The Men in Masks,XXXII,183,43,22,"The scariest moment of my life occurred when I was age [10 M] and in 4th grade. The reason I remember that so distinctly was because the incident happened a week before my birthday in March of the year 2003. The clarity of the 15 minute or so ordeal has stuck with me to this day

The day that turned into a horror story for me started off on a rather exciting note. My parents informed me that for the first time ever I would be staying home alone for a little while since they were going to a party until midnight

Evening comes, but close enough to feel like a community.  I lived in a 3 level home about 4 minutes into the subdivision from a main road.

So at 10pm my developing self-control told me I should probably stop playing video game and head upstairs for some rest.  I brushed my teeth and decided to read in bed until I got tired. After 10 minutes of reading, right? Was it brother's friend who lived next door? Well it seemed kind of late for that...

I didn’t turn on the light to the stairway

Facing the front door were three men in masks. I only glanced for a second but they are ingrained in my memory forever. All three masks were grotesque Halloween style

I crept into my upstairs bathroom that was directly over the front door to get another look the men in the masks and I remember shaking from fear. Sense was quickly leaving me, holding an object I didn't immediately recognize. (Over the years I have speculated either a camera or firearm but never knew for sure).  However in my haste, the slot of light streaming out of the window quickly caught their attention and they gazed up at me. 

I'm sure my small figured was outlined by the light, them staring right back at me. Suddenly they left the front door and went by the side of the house. I ran to my room turning off all the lights and huddling under my desk in hiding. I could hear the motion light by the sliding glass door facing my backyard clicking on and off over the next 15 minutes but I didn't dare look outside. I braced myself to hear pounding on the downstairs back windows, and at any moment it felt like I would hear glass shattering and them barging inside. Crying, shivering, not feeling safe inside my own house had to be some of the worst 15 minutes of my life, especially at such a young age. 

Thankfully

For a few years I became super protective of my brother

I enjoy this subreddit in almost a masochist (Def: A willingness or tendency to subject oneself to unpleasant or trying experience for pleasure) type fashion because of that moment in my life

1354706073.0,14bgfv,A day at the park ,lavenderKisses,173,28,16,"Age: 15 Gender: female

Six years ago I had the scare of my life.  When I was fifteen I had gotten my first job working at McDonald's. When I wasn't at school I was at work; I hardly had a day off. I didn't complain because my mom was a single parent and she had to work and raise two kids at the same time. A lot of the times she could barely make ends meet. So when my ex-stepdad called and said he could hire me, I was just glad I could help out my mom. 

In the beginning of October I had a rare weekend off.I remember that  I was thankful for it because as much as I loved the money

 ""I'm bored

She wouldn't stop saying that and it was getting on my nerves. Dealing with a hyper nine year old wasn't good when your tired. I tried telling her to ""go away"" and ""leave me alone"" but sadly that didn't work and eventually I caved in. So I decided to take her to the park that was nearby so she would stop being as annoying. She was  pleased with my decision and was pretty excited to go. I went to my room got dressed

The park wasn't that far from where we lived. It was about a 15 minute walk. I say 15 minutes because the town where we lived at was very hilly. A lot if the streets have pretty steep hills and whatnot. Form where we lived You could see the park on top of a hill. It was basically two streets over form the huge apartment complex in which we lived. Climbing the hill or walking on the street was pretty difficult and dangerous. But luckily for us there were these old cement steps we climbed instead. When we got to the park my sister made a beeline towards the slides

For a good while we had fun. It was nice spending time with each other without getting on each others nerves. Eventually my arms got really tired so I took a break and relaxed a for a little bit. Sitting there on the swing I decided to look at my surroundings when I noticed something that made me very uneasy; a middle aged man staring at us. His hair was was starting grey and he was wearing a dirty white t-shirt and jeans. He looked very out of place. There were no other kids at the park so he couldn't have been a parent and just the way he stared was fucking creepy. Following my gut instinct

I grabbed my sisters hand

I don't know how we did it but we managed to get down the stairs safely and uninjured. But the man was still chasing us, we knew this lady who lived right by the stairs. We made a mad dash for her house and knocked on her door. Thankfully she opened the door and saw the look of panic on our faces. She saw the man running towards us and  promptly let us in. When we looked out her window the man came to a complete stop and glared at us for about five minutes and then headed back the way he came. We stayed at the lady's house for a good while until we felt that it was safe to go back home. 

I think we were really lucky. I don't to know what might have happened if that man had  got us on that day
  
TL;DR went to the park with my little sister. We then saw a creepy man who chased us until we found safety form a lady we knew.

This story happened last fall, cafeteria, art gallery, just everything. I don't often go to the student center because I don't actually hang out at my college, I usually just go to class and then go home. One day I was really hungry, and was in the mood for chicken tenders so I stopped by the student center in between classes to get some. I got my food, a drink

After a few minutes this guy sat at my table and told me him and his friend have an online show called ""chicks on campus"" which is just about interviewing girls at our college, and what I want to do in my life but I was completely wrong. 

He comes back with his friend who introduced himself as ""Beets"" to me, and what I like to do in my free time. He then started asking me strange questions about my relationship, they started off as kind of innocent asking things like ""how long have you two been together?"" ""what was your first date like?"" but then he just dropped a creeper bomb. ""What is your favorite sex postion?"" ""how many people have you slept with?"" ""what is your breast size?"". Once he started asking these questions my face got really red and I kept on saying ""i'm not comfortable answering these questions.""

He continued to ask these questions even though I kept on telling him I'm not answering them, let's wrap it up. Give him a big kiss!"" I gave him a glare and said ""No, I think we're done here. I'm uncomfortable.""

As they got up and left one of them said to the other ""She's a lot more uptight than the others"" and I just felt sick. I went to class after that and all I could think about is how they have that conversation on video and might be putting it on youtube. After class my friends talked me into going to security

Around 12 the man goes out with out a head lamp to ""use the bathroom"".  At this point I try to place my wifes hand on the knife beside my pillow because I know she will be awake and terrified as well.

He did this for what seemed like hours. He would sometimes run his fingers along my window and scratch the trailer as he did his rounds. He even made eye contact with me, he got violent. He began to bring something like a chain
Eventually, over this period of time we started seeing my dad more. However, since my dad is a long haul truck driver, we didn’t see him all the time. My mom began to let my dad even stay with us when he wasn’t on the road. Each time my dad would come home, the man never came. We loved it when my dad was home. We could sleep in our own beds and things seemed normal. However, when he left, the man started bothering us again. He could tell when my dad was home because his big rig was parked near our trailer.
My dad eventually got tired of us being tormented at night, without the man knowing. As usual, after we all went to bed, the man came. Except, on this night it was particularly bad. That night, we had a huge rain storm, and the man was outside with his chain hitting our trailer. He did this for about an hour until my dad snuck outside and laid down in a bush until the man came around. My dad jumped on him and began to beat on him until he got away. My dad chased him miles down the road, because he ditched out into farm land. We never heard from the man again. He never came back and shortly after we moved away.

My tale isn't quite so disturbing as some of the others you've read here. There is no murder

First, as a result, with a suit just visible under my longcoat. I was also listening to music, and more or less shutting out the rest of the world.

I'm also not a big guy, and was at least an inch or two taller.

All this in mind; I suppose I looked like the perfect victim. 

The time was around midnight, so I wasn't particularly concerned. Not only that, the whole area was peppered with security cameras. I felt secure.

Entering the station; I noticed that there were two people sitting on a nearby windowsill - a tall, intercepting me before I could reach an escalator down to the train platform. 


""Hey man

I figured he was just some ordinary panhandler. At this point

""No, and he edged a bit closer to me as I did. He was already becoming slightly aggravated. 

""Just spare some cash, man, I need the money."" 

""I told you, I felt a powerful hand on my shoulder. He spun me around, positioning me so I was approximately five feet from his face.

As he did so, my brain registered a single thought: 

""That's a knife."" 

I froze up. A rapid sequence of somewhat panicked thoughts went through my head. This sort of shit didn't happen in this area of the city! This was the kind of incident you'd hear about downtown

""Man, just give me some cash, man."" 

I pulled out my wallet. Yanked out the five dollar bill

One day my older sister and I were home because of a day off of school

Now some context as to the layout of our house at the time. It was positioned on a hill

 We were downstairs watching tv when out of the corner of my eye, she said, ""nope, nope, you didn't see anything."" Just then we saw the door move as if someone was trying to pull it open. We both ducked down and crept to the stairs.

We were on our hands and knees because our front door had windows. My sister finally bolted up the second half of the stairs and into the kitchen. This left me right under to door as the person tried to open it. My sister peaked around the corner of the kitchen doorway to see if the person was still there.

When the coast was clear, ready to attack the potential intruder. I stifled my laughter at the hilarious visual long enough to call my friend's dad who worked from home next door. While we waited, we could hear the person trying to open doors all around the house. Thank goodness my sister is paranoid and locks every door at all times.

Our neighbor showed up, gardeners, etc.). Turns out it was a guy from terminex who was soon fired for this incident. There was no reason for him to try to come into the house especially without trying to ring the doorbell first.

We were on a cruise of the Grecian islands and docked at some point in Turkey (I can't remember now). It was myself and a few friends, but I chose to ignore him because I didn't want to be the only one left. Not saying this was a bad choice, or that Turkey is bad, but he was overprotective..so I was already on my guard..assuming that this place might be kind of dangerous if my dad is concerned.

We found one, kind of a hole in the wall not in the main part of town. Looking back, I see that as very stupid. 

Anyway, and that's when I randomly pick up on the conversation between Susie and her artist. He is telling her about how beautiful she is, and how her skin is perfect. She's young, naive, and had just been dumped by her boyfriend so was eating it up. I am unsure at this point if I should say something..not wanting to be rude, and I seem to be the only one who is concerned. That's when he seemingly starts to size her up..looking her over, going over her attributes verbally with her, I am super uncomfortable with everyone staring at her, and we need to leave asap. She complains that she doesn't want to and he completely ignores me and continues to ask her if she is a virgin. Instead of seeing that as a not ok thing for a middle aged man to ask of a 15 year old girl in general

I joined a dating site in early 2013, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me. Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I had already moved on from my fling and was not interested in his advances. One morning, when I walked outside of my apartment, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, etc. Because I was very stressed

After our casual hook up, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies. Around this point, he was capable/serious of causing me a great amount of trouble with the immigration department. Everyday

The next day, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

1369061256.0,1ep2dw,Just One Kiss (long),love_occurs,170,32,17,"I've been lurking around here for a while now

A little bit of background information: in this particular townhouse community, my roommates and I were considered ""party girls"" by our back porch neighbors, 3 somewhat socially awkward guys who rarely went out or threw parties of their own.  This night our neighbors had two friends visiting, and they asked us if we would throw a small party so their friends would have a good time.  Additionally, my school was a decent party school and had a fairly high ratio of girls to guys, so many guys (visitors or students) had a very entitled attitude and believed they could get any girl to go home with them.    

It started out normal enough.  Typical crowd of people, sipping our drinks and chatting with our close friend Ben and the two visitors, ""Black Shirt Guy"" and ""White Shirt Guy"" (Rachel and I forgot their names about 10 minutes after we were introduced, so we've been calling them this for years).  We were all laughing, having a good time, when suddenly White Shirt Guy picks me up, throws me over his shoulder and carries me inside.  At first I thought it was a joke, where several of our other friends were playing cards.    

When he reached the staircase leading up to my bedroom, but he calmly carried me up the stairs and into my room, where he then threw me on my bed.  I laid there, stunned, for a few seconds while he just stared at me.  Not once during this encounter had he said a single word.  Luckily, Ben and Rachel came charging into my room, and Rachel pulled me away while Ben yelled at White Shirt Guy.    

The creepy didn't end there, and get me to kiss him.  He apologized for the ""misunderstanding,"" but remained very insistent that I should let him hold me/kiss me.

""You're so pretty.  I just want to kiss you!""    
""Just come sit on my lap.  I just want to give you a kiss.""    
""Why won't you kiss me?!  Just one kiss!  I want to kiss you!"" et cetera.    


Each time I declined and pushed my way back to my friends, knowing that I couldn't get up to my room without physically climbing over him.  I am 100% sure this was deliberate; he did not want me to go to bed without him noticing.    

At one point he left to go to the bathroom and I seized the opportunity to bolt up to my room and, finding it locked, got very angry and started pounding on the door, yelling my name, swearing at me, and demanding I let him in.  I freaked and locked myself in my bathroom (we each had our own private bathrooms as well as the half bath in the kitchen), hoping I would be safe behind two sets of locked doors.  I'm not sure how long I was huddled in the bathroom, back to the neighbor's house.  I eventually crawled into my bed and turned the TV on full volume

I didn't interact with White Shirt or Black Shirt Guy for the rest of their stay

TL;DR: college neighbors ask us to throw a party for their visiting friends, blocks me from getting into my room, spends long time pounding on my door and yelling at me.  Black Shirt Guy ended up being quite creepy as well, but this story is long enough already...

At one point he started saying some sexual stuff, stuff I didn't really feel that comfortable talking to anyone about, let alone on a first date, but I just chalked it up to the age gap.

The next morning he called me asking if I wanted to get breakfast with him.  More free food, I wasn't so stupid to be oblivious to the fact that he was probably going to try to have sex with me, but I was stupid enough to accept his invitation, thinking in my little pea brain that I'd be in control and able to stop him if things went awry.  I was still wooed by the whole ""older man with a job, car, and house wants to take me out and stuff"" charm.

Strangely nothing scary happened at his place.  He kissed me and laid be down on his bed but I got up and walked into the kitchen and he didn't stop me.  Then

A few nights after our dates he called me in the late evening to chat.  As we were talking, he'd pay for everything and we could stay in bed all day.  I told him I was going to spend the summer (which was soon) with my mother three states away, and he asked if he could come visit me, saying he'd love to meet my mother.

One night I was home watching T.V. It was about 1130 p.m and I hear a knock on my door.

I have ran my course a fair few times without anything strange or anything out of the ordinary happening. On Wednesday 22 of August, the sun was setting, making it darker and darker. I decided to quicken the pace as it was getting a bit too dark for me. I just continued jogging with Biffy Clyro blaring through headphones.

 Then I had noticed the surroundings looked a bit unfamiliar to me, I had no clue which path I had taken, or where I was. I decided the best idea would be to turn back and try to get onto my path, or at least somewhere I recognised.. I took my earphones out whilst I was having a slight jog back to familiar ground, by this time it was pretty much pitch black under the canopy of the trees..

A slight panic started as I was jogging fast to try and get to somewhere I knew. As I continued to look around, so I stood still and peered over the nettles/tree branches to get a clearer look.

Then, as the first person passed through the trees, more, slowly came passing into sight. They were walking slowly

Only one of them had the torch in their hand, They would've seen me, And I didn't want to running further into the middle of nowhere as I was already lost. I just crouched down into the bush/nettles as they passed by me. By this point, I could see them close enough to see their details.

There were about 15 to 20 of them, (a few would chant something, then the others would chant different words, in a reply kind of thing) As They were walking past me, I felt a horrible feeling I have never felt before. My heart was beating faster, everything felt as if it went colder, freezing cold (maybe this was my nerves/anxiety as I don't believe in ghosts) .

As they continued to walk on past me, and how they escaped to Scotland and Wales when they were disbanded- more info on the Templar's here &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-IQLCgOTpg please watch this video, it is very interesting)

 After they had passed me and were a distance away I felt safe enough, but I ran more and more, Eventually after a while, I found where I was and I walked, cautiously, home.

Basically every single pet peeve I had was born in this girl. At first I blamed it on her not understanding American etiquette (she's a foreign student from China). 

But then things started to get creepy. When I went home for the weekend a few weeks into the semester, i feel more comfortable with you here with me."" Mind you I only met this chick on move-in day and only said a few words to her. I should have known to keep my guard up after that. 

Every once in a while she would stare off into space longingly for half an hour. Sometimes I would catch her watching me study out of the corner of my eye. After along day of studying in the library I went to the patio in our dorm to get some ice from the machine and found her with her head on a table with her eyes wide open staring at something in the distance. I think she scared off the guy I like because he stopped coming around to see me once he found out she was my roommate. 

After she creeped me out so much, but I couldn't live with her anymore. Today I emailed my RD that I wanted a room change. I told her that I wasn't comfortable living in my dorm anymore with this girl. 

I was sitting in my room while my roommate was out today when I hear a banging on the door. I was then greeted by two solemn looking campus police officers and the RD of my building. they calmly asked me where my roommate was, screaming, and eventually hyperventilating. I thought maybe someone close to her died, and was feeling sorry that I had asked for a room change during her time of need. I could only make out a few bits and pieces of what she was saying to the RD. 
""I'm sorry I didn't mean to...I promise I won't do it again...""

The police officer pulled me aside and quietly asks if there is anything in the room she can hurt herself with. I gesture to her drawer where I know I have seen a small knife with a wooden sheath on occasion. He went through the drawer but didn't find anything. Suddenly she was right behind him screaming.

""Don't you dare go through my things!""
""We don't want you to harm yourself...please calm do-""
 ""You think I'm going to harm my roommate? I wouldn't do that she's just silly! [wtf?] I'm not going to hurt anyone I just want to be left alone!""

By then the RD dragged me out of the room and told me what was going on. She got into a big fight with her best friend (I didn't think she had any) and started sending her threatening emails and even threatened to kill herself. By this time I was in complete shock. I just saw someone completely lose it right in front of me. She told me that she had received my room change request and was going to meet with me tomorrow. I told her I would stay with a friend for the night. 

After my roommate calmed down a bit

I was waiting in my dorm common area for my friend to get back to her dorm when I realized I forgot a blanket. I went inside thinking that someone was going to be in the room keeping an eye over her
""Where are you going?"" I have never heard her use this tone of voice with anyone before. She was livid. 
""I'm gonna stay with my friend for the night.""
""Why? Because of me?"" I swear I saw smoke rising from the top of her head and a vein in her forehead was about to burst.
""Sleepover!""

I got out of there and nearly ran to my friends dorm.  I talked to the RD and there are no more rooms open in my housing complex

 I'm just afraid that she is going to take this out on me. I don't think I can return to my dorm. She looked like she was out for blood when I came back. 

Tl;dr I thought my college roommate was a bit off

I live in the top of a duplex. In order to get inside my apartment you have to go through the bottom steel door

One night the door didn't latch (I'm assuming) after my friends had left. I was laying in bed at exactly 4:41 am when I heard my bottom door open. I was almost asleep but it jolted me awake, stood a young man. He was white, had dark shaggy hair, and a hipster beard. He also wore dark framed glasses and a fedora (ridiculous, I know.) 

Angry, smiles and says ""I just thought you were asleep. I'll come back later.""

I fucking lost it and started screaming for my boyfriend. I had up to this point not wanted to wake him up

The next morning, we never sleep.

1355515104.0,14uwru,Almost an airport abduction,34kitten92,175,36,17,"So this is my second story for this sub

I have to preface this story by saying I was a really smart kid when I was little. At 18 months, around 3-4, my mom let me cut my hair really short, like a boy's and everyone mistook me for one because I refused to wear anything ""girly."" Also, like most small children, I wasn't a good listener.

For some reason, so we were headed to a gate to pick whoever it was up. Or maybe we were just out in the main airport and it seemed like we were headed to a gate because I was so much smaller, so everything seemed bigger. Forgive the lack of memory, I was little. 

I do distinctly remember, I'm at it again. I ran down a small flight of stairs (maybe three or four steps at most) and was suddenly swooped up by a very large man. I remember that he smelled funny and that he had a really scraggly beard and blonde hair and really creepy eyes. He then starts to rush off with me, and I remember being very calm about the whole thing because, in my mind, my grandma was right there and she wouldn't let anyone hurt me.

Well, and whacking at him with her purse, and he said to her, ""Lady, chill. This is my son, the kid your looking for must have ran off."" That's when little old me pipes up and says, ""I am NOT a boy and you are NOT my daddy. Now put me down."" The guy looked shocked out of his mind and slightly repulsed and promptly put me down and RAN off.

Now, mostly because of his behavior. He didn't say a word to me, just picked me up and tried to hurry off, and then when it became clear I was a girl he high-tailed it out of there as fast as he could. If he was just a man who had made a simple mistake, he probably would have stuck around and apologized to my grandma for frightening her and for snatching me.

I lived in a second story apartment with another girl. We lived above a business

Until one night when a whisper woke me up from my sleep. He said, and I looked up to see some of the usual street light glow blocked from my view through the crack in my curtain. I slept naked, and I felt particularly vulnerable. I pulled the curtain back a little and saw the shadow of a big man STANDING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. I yelled ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT MY WINDOW I'M GOING TO CALL THE FUCKING COPS!""  I ran out of my room and called 911.  And they were complete dicks about it.

I live on the second floor, instead of trapped in my apartment. There was a ledge that ran around the side of the building with our bedroom windows, from the ""porch"" area. I checked back there, maglight in hand, and found no one.  Then I heard some banging from behind the building across the street. It so CLEARLY sounded like somebody climbing up on a dumpster. I sat there frozen, watching the building across the street.  Then I CLEARLY saw someone creep up around that front porch area (similar set up, apartments above a business) and then CLIMB IN A WINDOW.  I lost it.

The next morning, and was situated under and old satellite dish brace that was sticking out of the wall.  Great.

1376313921.0,1k7e25,Overnight Bus Creeper,LadyEmry,164,30,30,"This is my first post for Reddit


Anyway, Malaysia to Singapore. I had just started my trip and wasn't aware of the sort of harassment I would occasionally receive from men. I'd overslept and missed my flight so instead had to take an 11 hour bus ride instead. Unfortunately the date I took it was the ending of school holidays in Malaysia so most bus companies were completely booked out. I finally found one and paid a ridiculous price for a ""premium"" bus ticket. When we finally boarded at around 7pm I discovered that the bus was extremely cramped and dirty, covered with cockroaches running around the seats and along the walls. I turned my thongs (flip flops) into a makeshift cockroach swatter and settled in for the long ride. I'd been told we wouldn't get to Singapore until about 7am.

The man next to me was Asian, was I alone, where I would be staying, how old I was, did I have a boyfriend... I made awkward but polite small talk with him, making up a fictional boyfriend. Eventually it got late and we both tried to get some sleep. Fear of the cockroaches kept me awake though, so I spent an hour or so just lying there with my eyes closed attempting sleep when I felt a hand brush against my left thigh. I ignored it, squeezing my leg

I opened my eyes and he quickly drew his hand back. I asked him to please stop and rolled over in my seat to try and sleep again. This time after a few minutes I felt his hand rub my back and grasp my ass

I managed to get a tiny bit of sleep then awoke at 6.30am when the bus stopped. The man shook my shoulder and told me ""C'mon! Get out! It's Singapore!"" The time seemed right so groggy, we hadn't crossed the border yet. Singapore was the next stop. 

I turned around to see the man staring at me from a large group of men clustering around the bus and very quickly boarded the bus again. As we drove away I wondered if he'd done that deliberately- then I remembered that I had told him Singapore was my destination the night before

1365320716.0,1budfb,"My alcoholic mother - sexual abuse, secrets, and guilt over last words said to her",anonymousthrowaway21,175,35

For a little background on me I'm a 23 year old male who has long surpressed memories and things about my mother and abuse I endured with her as she battled alcoholism.


When I was younger I was awkward and had horrible self esteem because of what I endured with my mother.  She had been an alcoholic from the time she was 18 to her death in 2009 at the age of 53.  From everything I've heard the longest period she ever went without drinking was when she was pregnant with me.  Growing up I remember my parents fighting a lot and I didn't understand why.  As most kids do I assumed it was my fault.  My dad would hear that she picked me up from daycare drunk and yell at her pretty aggressively and being too young to really understand what that meant assumed it was my fault.  I was really young and don't remember these memories vividly but I can distinctly remember feelings


As I got older(probably around kindergarten or first grade) I began to notice that there were two different versions of my mom.  This sounds weird but I really remember thinking about it as if she were two different people.  One was my normal mom.  The other was that slurred and couldn't walk straight.  I remember asking both of my parents what was going on and one day my dad sat me down and told me she was sick.  She had a sickness called alcoholism.  

Now


Another memory I have(and I have no earthly idea if this is prior to the above incident or after it) was my mother taking a bath with me.  Apparently she had told me she'd do it before it happened because I remember that day I was swimming and her and my grandparents were with us.  Again


The last sexual incident I remember I was 

I never told anyone about this

Now I'll get into some more abuse.  Since I really can't piece together a narrative I'm just trying to tell about one kind of abuse at a time.  In addition to the sexual abuse I got a wide range of emotional abuse.  After I started understanding what alcoholism is I would get angry with her.  When I'd come home and she was drunk I would feel betrayed and would more or less sull up in the following days.  I guess in a way to combat that my mom said it was her nerves and blamed things I did for making her nervous and forcing her to self medicate.  This REALLY fucked me up for a while because she would use things I did as an excuse to drink.  If I brought home a bad grade on a test she'd say she got nervous and drink. If I got in trouble.  Basically anything I did was the cause and it really made me feel really guilty.  

My dad had told me that they might get a divorce soon because of this problem and told me if they split up they'd still love me just as much.  Because I thought I was the cause of her drinking I began lying to my dad and telling him nothing.  If he got home late and she was passed out I'd say she was just sleeping.  If she was drunk and awake when he got home I would lie and say she didn't drive with me drunk.  If he knew about 1% of the stuff that happened he would have divorced her and got me out of there in a heartbeat.

One example I remember of her using guilt on me that caused me great embarrassment in school happened when I failed to turn in homework for like the third time in sixth grade and the teacher told me she was going to call my mom.  I lost it and started crying and begging her not to because she would drink(in front of the whole class).  The teacher said it wasn't her problem and that it's my fault for not doing my homework.  So here's a second adult placing the blame on me.  I get home and of course she's drunk and blames me.

Another memory I have of her is when she was in a different town so that she could attend AA meetings.  She had an apartment and since they had these accountability buddies and she had no car my dad would take me there on the weekends to stay.  I don't remember if she stayed sober or not.  Probably not though.  Well one night I got up to go to the bathroom and she was asleep in a chair on top of another man


There was another incident I don't know the whole story to because I was so young and I'm not going to ever ask about it.  She was in another town, like several jobs, she got fired for showing up drunk to).  We couldn't find her when we came to visit one weekend and I remember that night he found her drunk walking with another man to his car.  My dad gets mad and tells her to come with us.  The other guy starts to stand up for her but my dad tells him that's his wife and I guess the guy realizing what's going on and seeing a petrified me there and backs off.  I don't know if she was going to cheat with someone she just met, if she had already been seeing, or if maybe she was just going to a bar or something.  And I'll never ask my dad what he knows.

Another traumatizing experience was there had been a news story where a mother had drowned her children on TV.  I was probably about 8 and she drove to a peer told me that I didn't love her and she was going to drive us both off a bridge.  I cried and begged her not to.  She eventually turned around and went home.

There's a ton more stories but this is already pretty long so I'll tell the story of her death. On a Wednesday when I was away at college I got a call that my dad had a heart attack and was being rushed to the hospital.  He wound up living and that Friday when my mom was there she had to go to the ER where they told her she had to get her gallbladder removed.  So she had surgery that day and they discharged my dad that Saturday.  Since she couldn't drive anymore(2 DUIs got her license suspended) the decision was made for my dad to stay with some more family and me to stay there for the 1-2 days until they discharged her and bring her home.  And it was a very nice stay with her.  We talked a lot(about my senior year of HS I began distancing myself from her becausei sincerely expected her to die and I didn't want it to hurt - she was incredibly underweight due to a combination of anorexia, which i do.  


So I go to see some friends for a while once they're settled and I get home around midnight. I see a light on in her room and know something's up.  I go in there and she's so messed up she couldn't even talk.  I look on her dresser and I see a bottle for lortab(due to her surgery) and I realize she took a bunch to ger high.  I know that the tylenol can be fatal to the liver and is probably double dangerous to a liver ravaged by drug abuse.  So I'm pissed and decide I'm going to to carry her to my car and take her to the ER. I go wake my dad up on the couch and tell him. So I'm putting shoes on her and I snapped.  I went off on her.  I told her she was a horrible mother



I went to my car to move a box I had in my passenger seat so I could carry her and sit her in there.  When I got back in her room I wish I could put into words the quietness I felt.  I walked in the room and I felt like I was alone in it.   So I walk over to her and watch her stomach for a second and see its not moving.  I freak out and call my dad saying I think she's not breathing.  He runs in there and looks and agrees.  He tells me to call 911 and I do.  I tell them what's going on and they say get her off the bed.  I do and when I pick her up vomit pours out of her.  It looks like that fanta I bought her.  Knowing my dads heart and I tell him to go outside and make sure the ambulance didn't miss our house. The dispatcher tells me to perform CPR until the ambulance gets there.  Right as I start I realize her eyes are open and I knew she was gone.  She had dead eyes with no human behind them - this haunted me for a while and still sometimes does on random occasions.  I remember doing CPR and feeling her rib cage bend under my push and the sound of the pressure trying to push more vomit or something through her throat.  To this day I can't watch anything that involves CPR.  The paramedics got there and there was nothing they could do.  They said she drowned on her own vomit.  And I realized I watched her die.  I watched her as she was telling me what was going on and in her final moments she heard how much I resented her.  The last thing she ever heard was I hate you as she drowned on her own vomit which was likely a drink I gave her.  So I feel guilt over that.  I also feel guilt over my emotion when it was over.  When the ambulance left with her body I felt relief.  No more wondering when me or my dad would find her dead.

And then as I started unearthing some of these memories it really messed with me.  I want to feel sadness.  I want to mourne.  And sometimes I even do.  But sometimes I think about her and I'm glad she's dead.  This is a contrast to my dad who decided to latch on to the positive memories.  So I can't really discuss this with him on a surface level.

TL;DR - I suffered emotional and sexual abuse from an alcoholic mother who I eventually unknowingly watched die as I told her I hated her.

I have only had a few creepy experiences in my life. Two of which I have posted on here


Last week, nothing else significant until we went down the candy aisle. My friend, Veronica is looking at the different assortments of chocolates while I just standing there looking down at the floor. I must have been lost in thought or simply not paying attention because I didn't hear someone approach me. 


""So, waiting for an answer to his question.


""Uh...yeah..."" I am a talkative person but when it comes to strangers I am the most socially inadequate person. He smiles and takes a step closer to me.


""Mmm...me too...white chocolate is my fave. Never been into the dark myself."" He says this while dragging his eyes from my feet to my head. Then licks his lips and smiles. He was maybe 30 years old, and was decently cute, no reason to be creeped out by his appearance. 


""ha..."" I try to scoot on closer to Veronica and start a conversation with her so that I wouldn't have to be in awkward conversation with him. 


""Hmm...I think you are my new fave. See ya later

 
Fast forward a day after that, I start to pull out. I head out to a local carry out and pick up a few items. I am gone for about 20 minutes total. I get home and as I walk up to my door, I hear a car pull in my drive way. I share a driveway with my two neighbors so I figured it was just them. 


I'm inside when I hear my sliding door open. The door handle jingles once then twice. Worried that whoever it is will see me bend a blind to look out the door, or maybe it was a coincidence and he mistakenly came to my house. 


He leaves and for the next few hours I am in my house by myself watching tv and cruising the web. I decide to go out and get the mail since I was expecting some electronics and didn't want them sitting out in the cold. I slip my shoes on and jacket and unlock the front door. I walk down to the mail box and get my stuff. I go to head back when a vehicle starts driving down the road (it was dark out so I couldn't see exactly what it was till it was closer)


The vehicle stops in front of my house and I walk even faster trying to reach the door. Right as I grab the door handle I hear someone yelling. I couldn't make out what they said, dead bolt, and door knob lock.


I always lock the locks in order from chain, but I only get the chain locked when I feel a force push on the door. I was in full force panic and shoved against the door as hard as I could. I figured being a bit of a chubby gal I could overcome him. He pushed harder and the door flew open as far as the chain lock would along. He stuck his face up in the space and started to say a bunch of odd shit.


""Oh I have been waiting so long. You can't lock me out now. Let me come in. Always fighting me aren't you? Why do you have to always fight me!? Let's work this out, I punched him in the face. He flew back a few inches and I took the opportunity to slam the door and dead bolt it. I realize now I should have dead bolted the door first but out of habit I made the mistake of doing the chain first. 


I called the cops and within an hour they were there looking around. Of course


The next morning is when the phone calls started. This guy left a dozen messages. I wrote down the entire message from a couple of them. I saved them on my voice mail, bare with me, I tried to make out all the words)


""Hey toots (he loves this word apparently)! I miss you. I love you. I really want to know what it feels like inside you. Mmm...sweet chocolate baby of mine. I think you're the one for me to enjoy and play for keeps (that part is mumbly so not sure if he said 'play for keeps' or 'mine to keep') and just love. I hope you don't let another man take what's mine, only me and my everything (once again, not sure if it's 'everything' or something else). I am tired of fighting, always fighting me, fighting just makes it harder on you, yanno? Just pick up, come outside, if you know what I am saying

My dad woke up early one morning to go for a run as he usually did (seeing as he was a marathon runner). He went to put on his usual running gear which was where he had left it the previous day, the items were nowhere to be found. Shrugging, he figured he left them at his friend's place after the last race he went to. 

Later on in the week, he also remembers other minor things having gone missing lately; a roll of quarters for parking, toilet paper, a toothbrush. He just chalks it up to forgetfulness, and tries to ignore the slight feeling of unease.

The next day, putting my ravioli in the freezer, and heads out to go pick me up from my mom's.

We get home and Dad goes to make me dinner. He opens the freezer and lo and behold, rational guy, so despite the weird little petty thefts being significant in themselves, acknowledges that someone must be entering the house.

Dad figures it wouldn't be a bad idea to call the local police station. ""Well, but I'm missing a pair of sneakers, an old Boston University hoodie, a gallon of milk, a box of frozen ravioli. Someone's been taking some things out of the house,"" he says, a bit ashamedly. He hears a chuckle over the line. ""I know, but just keep an eye out for me. I'll let you know if anything else goes missing.""

Maybe a week passes. The strange occurrences seem to slow down, until he receives a phone call. It's the local police, and this is what the officer on the line said:

""We found your man. He was walking around town wearing your hoodie

It turns out that the previous owners of the house were not very savory people. The man ended up being the son of the woman who owned the house before us. He was mentally unstable, wait around for my dad to leave, and steal small items from the home. We never really knew what the motivation was. It was still really creepy that he was around, watching, and with a child (me) around to boot. I never found out what his motivation was, but he did end up with minor jail time and I believe was relocated to a farther distance away.",,,,
1345554549.0,yktra,The Fire,hellpony,165,27,31,"Last November, he'd always been my favorite person

My dad's family, but this was too much.  I posted a Facebook status telling them I didn't want to be part of the family anymore, that they'd crossed the line and not to bother speaking to me or sending me birthday cards again.

I knew the post would be controversial.  The first response came in message form from a girl I'd gone to high school with and only vaguely knew.

She told me she was proud of me for standing up to my family and that she'd gone through something similar with hers.  We agreed to meet up for drinks that week.

We went to the local concert venue for some drinks and really hit it off.  As the alcohol started to take effect, due to some problems with her family.  We became best friends and emotional support for each other as we dealt with twentysomething girl problems.

Months down the road, we decided to get a place of our own.  My grandpa's death had left me with a small inheritance.  I bought an old trailer to restore and move into with my best friend.

We spent weeks painting and trying to restore the trailer.  I decorated it with all of the cute kitschy vintage stuff I'd acquired over the years.  We were told once that it looked dollhouse-perfect.

We both met guys at the same time and fell hard for them.  We'd always joke about how we were perfect best friends because our taste in men was so vastly different, quiet, and frankly, kind of strange.  My dude gave me some furniture from his old house, and, as we were moving it in, the ex-marine sat at our kitchen table wearing a towel and nothing else, seeking an ear scratch.  

In my bedroom, meaning I could never bring my mom's dog to visit.  I was uncomfortable with the situation but never enough to do anything more than joke about it with my roommate.  There were other things she did that were the cause for problems, like stealing my clothes out of my closet and never putting them back, smoking cigarettes in the kitchen instead of outside, and bingeing on the groceries that should have lasted us for weeks.  I bitched about it to my dude to vent, but never said anything to her.  Even though we had our respective prince charmings, we were still very close.

Throughout the beginning of this very hot summer, my roommate started to change.

She cut her hair so that she'd have bangs and dyed it black, impossible-to-miss blemishes she said came from the awesome, rough sex she'd have with the marine.  She'd be quiet and moody and her visits became more and more infrequent.  She'd tell me about the dreams she was having, once telling me, ""I dreamed I buried a woman to her neck in sand and drowned her in the tide.""  The ex-marine took her fishing and she confessed she loved the feeling of killing something small and helpless.  She posted pictures of the turtle she'd killed for soup on Facebook.

It was around the end of the month, but she didn't reply.  A week later, she told me she was going to rehab for her drinking problem and for things to do with her eating disorder, that she'd broken up with the marine, but a very recent Facebook check-in at a bar with him told me otherwise.

I felt betrayed that she'd lied to me.  One of my friends, and because we found more and more and more of my missing clothes in my ex-roommate's room, that I keep some of hers. So I did.

I felt guilty, I came home one day to find the back door pried open(!) and all of her stuff gone.  I was furious about the damage to the door and that she wouldn't even face me.
Two weeks later

One night, but I kind of wanted to stay home, smoke weed, and work on some art I wanted to finish.  But I half-begrudgingly agreed to head over to his place for the night.
When he went to work the next morning around 7:30

The first thing I noticed when I unlocked the door was the smell.  Gas.  Did I leave the stove on?  No
The walls and ceiling were black with fire damage.  A pile of something was still smoking on the stovetop.  Magazines

I scrambled to my bedroom first.  My Macbook Pro had been smashed with a hammer, were gone. Some of the stuff I'd kept of hers was piled by the door with my most expensive Xbox games (her boyfriend had an Xbox), and all of the smoke detectors had been ripped down.  Most of my clothes had been stolen.  A bag of his dog food I'd tucked into a cabinet was pulled out and sitting on the counter.

I felt sick.  My vision blurred.  The first thing my panicky brain had me do was call my father, and dragged the stove out of the trailer.  A cop took the report.  

Eventually, went to my mother's house.

The police took my computer and my point-and-shoot camera as evidence.  From what I hear, and the insurance company declared it a total loss.  It has since been scrapped.  They covered the damage to the trailer, but because my mother had paid for it as a gift to me, refused to pay for my stuff.

Everything I had has been lost.  I got a new laptop for my birthday, and all of my precious photography and music files are in evidence lockup.
I was in a car accident soon after.
I'm trying to find a new place to live, it's almost impossible.  Everything of any sort of value that I owned and have worked for since I was sixteen years old is gone.  I'm angry everyday.  
I haven't heard from the ex-roommate or her boyfriend.  Or the cops

To give you an idea of the layout, you are basically pinned against the wall. To the right of the register was my ""back room"" where my kids would hang out, watch tv and would nap. The building was facing the main road but there were houses behind us. The house directly behind my shop was occupied by a sweet couple who were Snow Birds so they only lived there in the winter time. He was always coming by and saying good morning, talking to the children, calling my young lady, ect. I'm 5 foot, 110lbs, heels). I had friends tell me their first impresion of me was a ""girlie girl"" or vulnerable because of the way I look/dress. In reality

One day after lunch
 Then the door opened and this guy walked in. Right away, disheveled, had wild looking eyes. He just felt...not right. The whole atmosphere changed when he came in.
   I'm not one to judge so I greet him as I do everyone else and ask ""How are you doing today?""
  He stood in the entranceway looking from my son (sitting 3 feet away from him) back to me
  ""I'm alright"" he replied almost annoyed.
  ""Just alright?"" I joked. I was trying to make light of the tension I could feel. He doesn't answer and just keeps looking from my boy to me. I could almost hear his thoughts...it was if he was rethinking his plan because there was a child there. Is he the type of person willing to hurt a child to get what he wants? 

 I'm thinking to myself that he doesn't know there are two babies sleeping in the next room and that I was prepared to fuck his shit up if he even tried anything in front of my son. He just stands there

 I picked up the phone casually and called the house behind me

1342312945.0,wklxt,Pen Pal Girl Wants ME!,1TimeThrowie,189,53,55,"I am a regular redditor who has been lurking on different subs

Back in grade 5 and 6, it became easier and easier to write to our pen pals. My first pen pal who's first name was Dom was very pleasant but seemed as though he didn't have any interest in writing long emails/letters. He seemed like a good guy and at the end of the year (grade 5), we went on an excursion (or field trip) to a local forest with our pen pals. All of us had a good time (except for the awkwardness) and some of us even kept writing to each other (and later facebook). 

In grade 6, I was quite amazed at her incredible grammar and formatting skills. Her handwriting was beyond neat and she always wrote a lot. I admit, half of it wasn't interesting but I still read it through boredom. 

The letters go forth and back and after 1 month, wary not to make her think she's not in my friend zone. 

Her letters and emails get more and more directed at me, being a grade 6 kid, did not report this to any teacher. I decided not to reply for a few days, to see if she lost interest in me. Nope. She began drawing love hearts and kisses next to her signature. I was slightly creeped out. Worst thing was, at the end of the year, all the pen pal buddies had to go on a combined trip to a forest/lake etc. I did NOT want to meet her. 

I later told my best friend Anthony (Tony) about her and after about 5 minutes of talking to Tony about her, telling her fake addresses and fake information about ourselves, claiming to be the sons of a billionaire and what not. She soaked it up like a sponge. Minty started asking if she could come over. We said no. She asked why. We told her lies. This went on for a long period of time and she never got tired of asking and getting lied to. 

Over the next 9 months

Skip ahead to the last 2 weeks of primary school, every pen pal got limited information about their partners and my birthday was coming up real quick. Minty did not hesitate to ask me if I was going to have a birthday party. Then she asked me the most disturbing thing out of all the letters/emails she sent to me. Minty asked me, Cameron, if I wanted to have sex with her since I was turning 12. I am still too stupid and immature to not report this. I brushed it off as a surprise joke so I said something along the lines like ""What does a sex mean?"" or something like that. Minty promised she'd show me and I finally told her ""no"", firmly. She did not reply for the next week. 

On the day of the excursion, told me to piss off to school and learn something so I can become a doctor when I grow up. I arrive to school and I literally, wet my pants. There is a girl beckoning me to go over to the school gates (obviously Minty) and I reluctantly go to her. She looks pretty (brown hair, hazel eyes), but her personality and aura set me off a distance. She would often stare at your mouth and not reply to anything you just said. We talked for about 10 minutes and I asked her politely how she knew who/what I looked like. She didn't reply to that and she asked me again, if I wanted to have sex with her. I told her ""no"". She told me I was an ""idiot"", ""asshole"", and I told her it wasn't funny and I was beginning to feel angry and unsafe. She simply walked away and I reported it to the teachers and showed them the letters/emails

Glad I'm happy I reported that.

Or she would have come back for me.

When I saw 'LetsNotMeet' I knew I had to share one of my own not-so-pleasant stories. 


It was Christmas Eve and I was a freshman in High School. My family has been split up for some time, yet I declined. I thought I could watch some of my new DVD's and get some alone time in the house, which is a rarity.

 I had noticed an unfamiliar car parked on the street, and started to settle down. I hadn't been home for more than 15 minutes when there was a knock at the door. I unlocked the door and opened it only a crack to see a man standing there. Dark Hair, Glasses, slightly overweight and dressed casually. He didn't LOOK like much of a threat, but my stomach dropped.
 He asked "" I was wondering about the car outside
Terrified I was crawling on the floor to the phone hoping he wouldn't be able to see me threw one of the windows. Then I heard the noises. Our house had an open garage door,and I saw the man through the window run to his car and drive off. My uncle had gotten him just in time and scared the man off!!
Who knows what would have happened if he hadn't made it home in time.

Until that one night...

I was approaching the corner less than ten feet away from the station doors, *running* straight at me. I ripped out my headphones just as he came to a halt and shouted something right in my face — ""FUCK ME! GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER! COME HOME AND FUCK ME!"". I could smell the liquor on his breath and see the decaying of his teeth. He was short and skinny, almost frail, with a wild, bushy beard and even wilder eyes. He didn't pose much of a threat to me if it came down to a physical confrontation (provided he wasn't armed), but his expression was enough to tickle the panic button in the back of my mind.

I hardened up and replied ""No"" in the firmest voice I could muster and walked on past him. Inappropriate sexual remarks and wolf-whistles are pretty much a daily occurrence for me in this city, and put his face close to mine once more, *screaming* things at me that I still shudder to repeat in my head. 

""Don't you know who I am?""
""I'll kill you
""I'll fucking slap you down to the sidewalk!""
""You'll be sorry you spoke to me that way

Those are the words I remember most, landing on my cheeks and in my mouth, which was hanging open in disbelief. A small streak of fire struck me and I started to feel angry and humiliated. I pushed past him once more and told him to fuck off, along with a few other choice words that I probably shouldn't have said given how angry he already was. I couldn't think straight. I could feel the eyes of the small crowd of people littered along the sidewalk, all stunned and no longer talking amongst themselves. Everyone was watching and no one was intervening. I looked at the cab parked a few feet away and gestured to him to help me out, pleading with my eyes for him to take me away from this situation. He just laughed and shook his head. Business as usual, I guess. I knew I was on my own to get out of this confrontation. 

He ran around me once more, grabbed at the strap of my purse, even tried to grope my breasts and behind. He was too drunk to hold on tightly to anything and I was putting up a good fight to rip myself away from his grasp, begging him to leave me alone. He wouldn't stop. I grabbed the collar of his shirt and flung him away as hard as I could, giving myself enough time to take off my high heels and ""arm"" myself. I was barefoot and backing slowly away from him, swinging a shoe at him whenever he got close and tried to grab me. I think I landed one blow, but I was so frightened at this point it was hard to think clearly. All I remember is yelling and swinging and trying not to stumble as I walked backwards... and the eyes of the spectators burning into my back.

He was carrying a plastic bag with something that looked boxy and electronic inside, he reached into his pocket and pulled out what I thought was an empty bottle (I never got a good look at it in the dark) and smashed it on the sidewalk. Holding a large shard of glass in his hand, he once again started running at me... I bolted. I ran around the corner and kept running , still barefoot, until my lungs were bursting. He didn't follow me. 

I stopped to catch my breath and put my shoes back on, and I vaguely recognized him as one of the people who had witnessed what just happened. Guilt was written all over his face, but he was trying to smile to make me feel at ease. He kept apologizing profusely for not stepping in, insisting that the guy appeared to be armed and that he wanted to call the police but his phone was dead. I was so shaken up, I couldn't even feel angry or blame anyone for not helping me, I just wanted someone to walk me home. He obliged, and insisted I call the police immediately.

It was stupid of me, police reports are never that simple. I didn't want to get into trouble, and although I have nothing to hide, the idea of bringing the cops into my apartment was still unsettling. What if they didn't believe me? What if they thought it wasn't a big deal and that I was wasting their time? What if they charged *me* with assault for hitting the guy with my shoe? I was in a completely irrational state of fear. 

I thanked the stranger for walking me home and ran inside and upstairs to my apartment, but I explained that I had been jumped at the station, not outside our building, so he was probably long gone. He calmed down again and brought me to the bathroom to dry my tears and get into the hot bath he had already prepared for me before I arrived (he's the best!). I calmed down to a point where I was able to get my thoughts together and do what I needed to do — call the police.

Two officers arrived five minutes later and took my full report, but listening to every word I had to say and taking my story very seriously. While one was taking my statement, I heard the other on his radio, saying something like ""Yeah, he matches the description of the other report we got tonight... definitely the same guy"". Turns out that plastic bag I saw the attacker carrying was stolen property from someone else he had jumped right before he got to me. I couldn't believe it. What if I hadn't called the cops? How many other people would he have robbed or assaulted that night? What else would he have gotten away with?

Within an hour or two of leaving my place, I said I would do it. He never called me back to pick me up, so I'm guessing they had no doubt in their minds that he was the culprit. After all, he was in possession of the items that had been reported stolen by the other victim. 

In the weeks following the incident, just knowing that I wasn't forgotten once they 'got the bad guy'.

He plead guilty to the charges, by sending another statement as to how my life had been affected negatively since the attack). 

For all I know, I'm starting to feel nervous that I'll encounter him again. I am much more cautious about traveling at night now, but I can't always find someone to accompany me and I can't just rearrange my life out of fear. I've been doing a great job at staying strong and not feeling like a victim or wallowing in self-pity since this happened. I try to comfort myself with the fact that it was a random attack and that he has no idea who I am or where I live and work. I will likely never see this guy again, and I truly hope he learned his lesson and will not try to hurt or steal from anyone else in the future. I feel strangely guilty for messing up his life by getting him thrown in jail, but what else was I supposed to do? It was the right thing to do, to help take someone dangerous off the streets so no one else would have to go through what I did, or be mugged like the other guy was.

1348782799.0,10l3dq,coworker from hell.,ermagerd_,170,35,31,"This is my first ever submission

 
This all started in 11th grade, so I didn't have any issues when Jay started working there. He was my age, and seemed like a bit of a weird guy. Nearly everyone who worked there found him to be annoying as hell. He was also a serial liar, and would make up lots of obviously fabricated stories to get attention. I figured he didn't have very many friends, and I knew that he was home-schooled, so maybe it was just that he hadn't had as much of a chance as the rest of us to socialize with people his own age. So I left him alone about it. I usually just smiled and nodded even when I knew he was full of shit.

 
Anyway, so he eventually added my number and started to text me as well. He wasn't the best conversation, but he seemed harmless, and I also have an abnormally high level of patience, so I didn't see any reason to ask him to stop. One day he texted me, asking me out. I hadn't known him for that long, and to be honest I didn't find him attractive at all. His personality also wasn't great, of course, and that I didn't want to talk to him anymore.


A few weeks go by, and how his parents and brothers were both physically and emotionally abusive to him. How his older brother molested Jay and his sister as kids. How his parents were kinky sex addicts. On and on. I kept telling him to get help from a professional or a distress center, and that I was not the person to be dealing with.

 
Then he started talking about taking his own life. This is when shit started to get real. He refused to confess these things to anyone but me. He would text me late at night, I wasn't about to accuse him of being a liar, because I didn't want to be the one responsible for pushing him over the edge. So I would stay up all night with him, begging and pleading with him to not do it. He started to get really morbid and describe different methods of suicide that he was contemplating. Multiple times he stopped responding to me for several hours, and I would panic and try calling his home phone. Once his mom answered, and I asked her if he was alright. She was really confused and told me that yeah, he was fine, and he would flip his shit right back because I called his house number. Apparently he didn't want anyone to know about his depression, while secretly resenting him for putting me through this. Looking back
 

Then he started asking me out again


Another few weeks passed. He texted me to tell me that he was going to his friend's cottage


The first day of his ""cottage visit"", but I figure its cause he's just a weird horny boy. I'm already not believing this (if you saw this kid, it would be clear that he's not the type that girls would throw themselves at), and it gets weirder as he goes on about how she is ""so into him"" already, and how she took her top off when she was swimming with him that afternoon, then how at night she would beg for him. I told him fine, it's good that you finally have someone in your life.


It doesn't stop of course, because I was pissed, I went on to tell him that I don't believe any of this, and that he needs to get a life. Anyway, so he sends me a picture of a GAGGED, TIED-UP brunette, lying on the fucking floor of the garage. To prove she is real or something, I stopped replying.


Another few weeks. His ""friend"" starts texting me (from the same number, trying to get me to say something bad about him. In my mind, I called bullshit on this right away, but I still didn't reply.


Then, but I mean EVERY DAY. When he finally showed up at my driver's ed school (a place he had zero business being at, considering it was way across town from where we both lived, plus the fact he already had his license) I really started to freak out. He must have been following me, because not even my closest friends knew that I was taking that class! I would avoid his gaze as much as I could, and take off as soon as we were dismissed. The texts resumed, this time saying things like ""please let me tie you up, let me tie you up and touch you"". The worst was ""if you dont let me then i will do it forcibly. i will find you and take you and tie you up so tight"". CREEPY SHIT. Then he randomly transfers my high school


That was the final straw. I let loose on him, that it was him texting me, not his friend, and that he is FUCKING WEIRD and needed to stay the hell away from me! He started making excuses for his actions, like ""oh i was drunk when i sent that"", but in the end he admitted I was right about everything. I told him if he tried to talk to me again besides at work about work-related things, I would call the cops. I guess he got the message because after that he left me alone.


A month later, and talking about bondage and gags to her. Another (lesbian) friend at the store told me that he was creeping her out as well, and that he was going to force her and her girlfriend to have a threesome with him. 


I could handle him creeping on me by myself, save for a few instances when he tried to reconcile, saying he was sorry. He still was asking for me to ""give him a chance"". At the time, I had blocked him on facebook, but he made a new account and tried to add me again recently (~3 years later).

One of my favorite activities is exploring old

A few years ago, partly for the thrill and partly because if something bad were to happen, I would feel terrible having brought someone else into that situation. So, I make plans to head there the next day after my classes let out.

The day of the trip, [I finally arrive at the place,](http://i.imgur.com/eFxSy.jpg) which luckily had an old bike path dead ending just past it.  It was completely [overtaken by vegetation](http://i.imgur.com/RNaUW.jpg) with trees growing up, through, and around the buildings, not to mention that the actual buildings were [just disintegrating](http://i.imgur.com/FMvMX.jpg), with paint peeling off every wall and ceiling.

I took my time, [and some kind of giant oven](http://i.imgur.com/ia3u5.jpg). After an hour or two of [successful exploring](http://i.imgur.com/SeBU7.jpg), I decided to head off happy with an SD card full of pictures. Soon after I pulled my bike back out through the hole in the fence I entered and started biking away, I remembered there was one last shot I wanted to get.  I'm pretty insistent on getting the shots I want, and I didn't know if I would ever come back, so I decided to just tough it out, ride back and take the picture.

As, and something in me said, ""don't let him see you go in there.""  I biked past him, and gave him a slight head nod, and figured I'd bike all the way to the end of the trail, turn around, and by the time I got back, having continued in the opposite direction.  I leisurely take my time get to the end and turn around, and walking back toward the dead end from which he came.  He had a happy look on his face

I decided to play it cool once more, let alone the same bike path.  I'm silently cursing myself for going back for one picture, as I slowly get closer. Finally, I'm about twenty feet away from him, and he calls out, ""I sure would like a ride, it's so hot out. Mind if I jump on?""  As soon as I hear this, sprinting down the bike path

 Typically in December here is below freezing but it was during a Chinook so it was moderately warm for a December morning. I decided since it was so nice out that i'd wear my skirt and some awesome kneeish high boots to school. I ended up catching the bus at 7AM right on time.

 I walked to the middle of the bus and sat down. I did notice the man in the back corner two seats down from me talking. I looked back to him and he smiled at me, your lips, your eyes, your mole. You are so pretty."" 

Now if these weren't any warnings for the upcoming events i'm not really sure what would be.

 I responded with thanks and just stared forward. He noticed that I wasn't looking at him and he sternly said ""Look at me."" I remember just staring at him for the rest of the bus ride. He continued with "" I have a fine arts major

 He sighed and asked me ""Are you Married?"" I responded in short with ""No."" and he just continued "" You can love a monkey

Finally it was time to get off.

 Being that I was wearing a skirt and he had pinned me in the window seat, He reached up my skirt and grabbed my ass. I jumped over and stared at him and he just said the words ""Fine arts centre.""

 I didn't really get to process what happened until half way through my first period class at 9 AM. That was when I started to second guess my decisions. I ran out of class to my T.A and called the police and my parents.

Anyway, approaching the intersection from the north, when a late-model black chevy malibu/impala was approaching the intersection from the west, and it was apparent from his speed he wasn't planning to stop. I lost my head (and I've been angry with myself ever since for this) and I pulled out right in front of him; he almost had to go off the road to avoid me. As soon as I did it I felt awful, and almost stopped right there to apologize to the driver (young black guy), but I was afraid it would end up as a confrontation despite my evident contrition. So, I just drove to work. He followed me on the highway for a bit

Last week, that's a pretty common car. Then tonight while I was mowing the lawn again, I saw the same car (maybe) stop at the intersection from the west side, sit there for a minute, then turn north on to my street, stop right in front of my house, let a guy out of the back seat, stopped mowing, and I lost sight of it too. A couple minutes after that, but I think the driver asked ""he go inside?"" and then maybe into a cell phone ""where you at?"". He then picked up the walker

I left my house (I should note that due to a full garage, and to call 911 if I saw anything again. So now I'm sitting in my office, afraid to go home, knowing I can't stay here, completely freaked out. I do have a gun, which I guess I'll start carrying everywhere. 

tldr; a road-rage incident may have gotten me in trouble with some very bad people.

UPDATE: I called the police again when I got home, with no sign of them. 

My wife was leaving our house today and called me to say that she saw a white Silverado with tinted windows and a special plate sitting in the street across from our house with the engine running, right before the police arrived, the truck was gone. The officer (different guy from the one on Friday night) said he’d drive around and look for the truck in the area.

So, and the ability to be patient, plan an attack, and coordinate several vehicles to use. I really hope I’m just paranoid, but my instinct is that I’m in serious trouble.

1366165057.0,1ci89t,Someone Under My Bed,rapeymcrape,160,26,37,"I just discovered this subreddit and realized it's time to talk about what happened to me 2 years ago. I created a throwaway account because I'm really not comfortable revealing my identity after writing about this. I'm a 25 year old female

One night I was home with my room mate and my boyfriend and we were watching movies in the living room that is at the front of the house. My room mate's girlfriend then came over drunk with another male friend of ours. The male friend sat down to watch movies with us and immediately passed out and my room mate and his girlfriend went to his bedroom at the back of the house and immediately started having the most insanely loud sex I've ever heard. She always sounded like the trashiest porn star or hooker I'd ever heard and the screaming could be heard from the street outside. 
A few minutes into their session my boyfriend and I were still watching movies, looking out the window it's a decent drop to the ground. Outside my window are vertical and horizontal beams that extend to hold up a little back porch/balcony for the lady upstairs. It really ruins the view having beams right there. 

My boyfriend went into my room and took off all of his clothes and jumped into my bed. I started to take off my clothes but stopped when I noticed the screen on my open window was missing. I had a cat at the time that was indoor only so my first thought was ""the screen is missing! Strega must have gotten out of the window!"" Then I noticed that the window was pushed up way more than I thought was possible. I kept thinking of my cat though

For some reason my first thought at that moment was that a friend was playing a prank on me and it was probably someone I knew, who cooperated with us completely. He was quiet and humble, and his eyes shook violently from side to side as if he was high on something. 

My room mate searched him. We emptied his pockets and he had condoms, and a business card for a youth probation officer (so clearly he was a troublemaker). We also found a piece of paper with names and phone numbers on it that indicated he lived with his mother in a hotel room in a notorious drug motel that catered to prostitutes and meth. His high school ID was from Hoopa High, and he was clearly from the local Hoopa Native American tribe or at least part Hoopa Native.
When we saw he had no weapons we started questioning why he was in my bedroom under my bed with all this stuff

Then he kept apologizing and saying he was sorry and knows it was stupid. I was still shocked and disgusted and wondering if he would have raped me if I had been alone, just the trash and IDs and phone numbers) and made sure to tell him we had his ID, knew where he lived, had his mom's number and his probation officer's number and that if we ever saw him on this street again he'd regret it. 
Our drunk friend and my room mate's girlfriend slept through this entire ordeal and we had to tell them the next morning what had happened while they slept. 

I know that I'm going to get a lot of shit from some of you for not calling the police, as soon as I discovered the kid he cooperated and showed no signs of aggression or intent to harm. He did everything we told him to. Third, upon searching him even though he had condoms and lube which are creepy, he had no weapons. This indicated to us that he had no plans of rape or assault, he probably just really wanted the thrill of masturbating under my bed while listening to the sex in the next room. He wasn't a big guy either, he was a little skinny kid that I could have easily overpowered even with my small frame. 
From the info we found on this kid, it's quite possible his family members are and either he would get the shit beat out of him by family or we would after getting him arrested. In the end I'm still terrified to keep my window open at all but I think we handled it well without having to get the police involved. After talking to the kid I really think he was thankful that we let him go with just a lecture. Having a gun pointed at him the whole time probably scared him enough to realize it was a serious offense he won't be repeating.

1363877009.0,1aqfjq,Some people need to start taking care of their own kids.,lamasgrande,174,37,34,"When I was twenty four, just all messed up.



A family interviewed me, and the couple was still married and in their mid forties.



So three months after I was interviewed, so they sent a driver to get me at the airport. I struck a conversation with the guy, since it was sort of a long drive and I was new to the city, and I wanted to know what there was to do, and such. 



Then we reached my future home to be for the entire year, and her rule was that “I was never to say no to the kids”; I finally met the kids, who were quite lovely, and the boy immediately liked me. 



I am a sporty person
since I used to train back in my hometown- this will be relevant later on. 



About a week into my moving, pooping and changing their diapers. So if the kids didn’t want to eat/take a crap/change their diapers, I couldn’t push them to; their body was wise enough to tell them when the diaper was bothering them, when they were hungry, etc. I had never seen a kid crying like crazy when you asked them to change their diapers, but that’s what the two year old would do. And of course, I was forbidden to say no to them, so they never ate when I was supposed to feed them



She also told me that they didn’t believe in spanking, was say “Stop”, grab the aggressor, and try to get them to be empathetic with the victim. So one day, the two year old really wanted my phone, and I hid it inside my pocket and bam!, she bitch slapped me across the face. Her mom saw her, telling her that that hurted me



Then there was this huge incident, so she forbid me to ever take the kids for another bath, since she was afraid that I would leave the water there, and the two year old who loved baths, would try to go in and fall and drown. I explained to her that I would have never expected the water not to go, since I was quite sure I lifted that thingy that blocks the plumbing, and that we never went upstairs, I made sure to close the bathroom and even the toilet’s lid. But she wouldn’t believe me



Then she told me she didn’t feel comfortable with the kids going in my room because there was a window near by, and then to a chair, and then the window. It just made no sense. 



She was crazy about organic stuff, and sweets as long as I kept them hiding from the kids. However, when I showed up with a coke, she wasn’t too happy. One time we took a trip to some organic ice cream place, and I got a chocolate ice cream, and as I was pouring it in my cup, she came right next to me and said “that has aspartame, if I were you



After that there were all these weird things she used to tell me, telling me that food on plates absolutely grossed her out, that she didn’t even clean her husbands plates, so why should she do it for someone else?; to which I replied I had set it aside to eat it later. And her face fell to the ground and she said “you ate that? That was sitting out for a long time, and it has bacteria, you will get sick”. I mean, it’s San Francisco COLD! And the food wasn’t out for days



She kept telling me things to try to scare me into staying home, BUT there are also coyotes so you might not want to stay out until too late…” which sounded quite weird given that we were in the city. “That place of town, is super dangerous, there are plenty of thieves over there” – in another nice part of the city where another nanny lived. 



Anyways, and it wasn’t like we were friends to just go for a coffee. So I came and she tells me that she feels that we’re not a good match, and that she thinks I should move to another family, that she had loads of negative feedback about me, and overall it had been such a horrible experience. And I was quite shocked and asked her what kind of feedback, but she wouldn’t tell me, because it was so much. She had already called the Au Pair agency representative, who explained to me that I had two weeks to find a new family or else
I had only been in San Francisco for 2 and a half weeks! 



In the meantime, and she feels quite happy with herself after negotiating that I should stay for one week – with a family that wants me out asap – so I can make a bit more cash, and then I should ask friends to stay with them or something, because although she was supposed to make sure the nannys were fine, she couldn’t have me at her place, since she didn’t even have a mattress or a couch for me to stay, etc. 


My host mom then says that during the time I stay with them, I am not a criminal or anything like that, why would the kids pay for the fact that you don’t like me? However, I told her that if she wanted me out, I was fine with that, that I cared to say good bye to the kids, but that was about it, don’t get me wrong but they won’t even remember you”


The next day I came out of my room and didn’t want to be near the kids that much, she was going downtown and asked me if I wanted to come with so I could get a new phone so that new host families could reach me, since I was required to give up my phone at the end of that week.



So I left the home, telling her that I was going to be a bit later than I thought, but that I just didn’t feel comfortable around her, and that I felt like I was a threat to the kids, and overall that I felt bad about the situation. 



So what she did was immediately call the agency, I couldn’t go get my stuff without someone from the agency present, and it might be the case that the agent would actually have to do my suitcase for me, since I might not be allowed inside the home anymore.



She texted me and said I was not to come to her place at all



I was completely shocked, that she was already treating me like I was a criminal and a monster, and I obviously didn’t like that. But they weren’t listening to me and said, look just stay somewhere until 8 pm when we can go get you, we’re too busy right now. 



So I was left completely confused, my friend was on a bus and saw me and I went home with her. 



By 8 pm I was picked up by the same dumb agent who took me to a friends place. She now insisted I stayed with her, that I refused her help. 



The next day the agency sent me an email telling me that because I had seriously threatened my host family and refused the agents help



And that’s how I ended up left in the streets of the US, and told her mom, who immediately took me to some lawyers, they kept asking me what I had done to them to make them so angry, and so upset and hate me so much, and I kept saying I hadn’t done anything. Which is still true. They tried to negotiate that they let me back in the program but they said they couldn’t. They reviewed the contract and whatnot but there was no way around it. 



I finally called them and told them that I would go to my own country’s embassy and complain that I had been smuggled into the US, so the least they could do was get me a flight; especially since I had just worked there for 3 weeks and there was no way I could have known they were going to kick me out like that, and I obviously had no savings (I had spent most of them paying to enroll in this program). They at least agreed on buying me a flight back home.



 This all happened in the span of three days



A few days after I left, and the answer was simply because “she was going out too much, and I was afraid of the sports that she used to practice”. So basically she wanted me out for going out during my own free time rather than stay locked in my room, and because of martial arts. 



Months later, so they called his boss and had him punished for talking to me.



I always wonder if that lady will keep saying just how everything is out there to kill you, because life doesn’t say yes all the time.




She was 44 years old, where they’re never told no, she should have raised them herself, and not bring people from other cultures to try to do so. All that these kids really really wanted was their mommy…

I bring this up because I obviously wasn't speeding but was soon pulled over.  The guy gets out of the car

""Do you have any tattoos?"" He asks.
""Yes I have three"" I said skeptically.
""What are they?""  I told him I had three and gave a simple description. He eyes me for a second. I ask him why he's asking and he says ""You have a warrant out for your arrest.""  I said
""For Driving while Intoxicated (??)""  I ask him where this warrant is coming from.  
He
This totally creeped me out, then I see him get on his radio and have a conversation.  He immediately walks back to my car and says ""Tell you boyfriend I'm a real cop"".  He can tell I'm upset at this point and asks me why.  I tell him because I might miss my flight due to this delay.  I also tell him that I've never even been pulled over for a DUI and would never drive while intoxicated.  He returns to his car for another 20 minute break.  Finally he returns to my car, hands me back my information, and tells me that he'll let me off this time, but if I get pulled over to expect getting arrested for the warrant.

So I did miss my flight.  While at my parents', state police and state warrant's office.  Nobody had ANY RECORD of any discretion of mine at all.

1357521203.0,163atq,Butterfly Tattoo,iliveinatent,161,26,19,"I went to college in France when I turned 18. It was my first time ever living away from home

 I rented a room in a house where there was one other International student

He was friends with an older man, and when I would look at him he would just grin. I didn't pay too much attention to him though because I was silly infatuated with my crush.

One morning all three of us went out for breakfast then came back home to hang out. (The older gentleman didn't live with us but he was ALWAYS hanging out with my guy.) We made plans to go out later at night and I decided to take a nap. I usually lock the door to my room but didn't that day for some reason.

I wake up from my nap with the old guy sitting on my bed and drawing with his finger on the exposed part of my chest. My face turned into a WTF!! expression and before I could speak he said

I got up all flustered but I didn't say anything. I didn't make a big deal out of it but I asked him to leave the room so I could get changed to go out.

A few weeks later there was a huge parade happening in the town we were in

When I got there, and that we can all go together once he arrives. He kept pressuring me to go with him and I found that a little strange that he was ditching his friend so easily. A few minutes later his phone rings. He hangs up and tells me that my crush can't make it, that he will join us way later. He says just come over to my place, I'll pick something up real quick and we'll leave. Don't be scared.

I was scared, but I was really naive and stupid. We take the tram and  reach his 'house', which is just, basically, a shed at the back of someone else's house which I suppose he was renting. I sit on the bed (the only place available to sit) and put my bag in between us for buffer space. He pulls out his laptop and is doing god knows what, and he keeps asking me to not be so scared and to remove the bag from between us. 

I try to laugh it off and pretend all is cool and I keep talking about random things thinking if I act normal he won't do anything fishy. He pulls the old 'you smell really good! Come closer I wanna smell you' routine. He rubs his nose on my neck and I freak out and stand up and I tell him that we should leave and go back to the city to watch the parade.

He kinda begrudgingly gets up and we leave. On our way back he is visibly upset and pissed off. On the tram back he starts whispering to me that since I'm a whore who fucks around with his friend

I was terrified and was still on the thought that if I was nice to him he will feel bad and be nice to me. I told him that I wasn't fucking around with anyone

He started badgering me to go back and spend the night at his place. I told him no. We got off the tram. He asked me again to spend the night with him. At this point I just had enough of that shit. I told him

He said that he wouldn't tell me how to get home so I told him that it's fine

When I finally hit a familiar street my heart skipped a beat. I couldn't believe I made it. I turned around and told him

After that I told my crush what a creep his friend was and he stopped talking to me. Such a douchebag. A few days later he got drunk and wanted to come make out

Sorry this is quite long. Once I made friends and grew into my skin I learned some common sense. A friend of mine also told me that the creep was married with kids and had a reputation for being creepy,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_163atq

At the last minute, mullet-clad ride operator looked me up and down as I climbed on, and I was not pleased to see that I was the only person inside the fully-enclosed ride.  Just as Mr. Carny was closing the door, an older man and his grandson hopped on, much to my relief.  The ride operator was clearly annoyed, but apparently undeterred in his quest for underage poontang.  He sat down in the control seat in the middle of the room, turned off the song that was playing, and he waggled his tongue lewdly at me while I was pinned to the wall like a helpless insect.  As the ride stopped

I ran back to the stage, and jumped in on the third song.  When I looked up from my sheet music, I saw Mr. Creepy Carny standing in the back of the crowd, glaring at me with his arms crossed.  He paced angrily back and forth while he waited for the set to end.  As the last notes of the last song faded out, I ducked back to the guys in the trombone section and hurriedly explained what had happened.  They immediately surrounded me and walked me away from the stage and back to the bus.  The carny followed the group, ducking between game trailers and rides, but couldn't get close to me.

This wasn't the only creepy experience I have had with carnies, especially if they are completely enclosed and you could be trapped with a carny who Feels Like Making Love.  Every time I hear that song, I remember the sinking feeling in my stomach that day on the Gravitron.

One delivery guy would stop to talk to me, etc. He would hint that we should hang out, but I politely rebuffed him (he was twice my age). He was one of those intense people who looks you right in the eye and won't ""let go"", so to speak.  

He was from a payroll company, he would stand by my desk and wait for me. He started saying things about how he could see in my eyes that I was a loving person, and he felt that he and I belonged together. He would proclaim how deep his feelings were for me -- all based on seeing me for about three minutes every two weeks.

One time, and he did, and it was super awkward because the delivery guy stood by my desk and waited, like the other guy was going to leave and then we'd be alone. Finally, he gave up and left.

The next time he came, and how badly he needed to talk to me, and how strongly he felt.

At that point I told my boss, because there was a new delivery guy two weeks later.

Background: I'm a 30 year old female. I live in a nice part of a pretty crappy city where all the crime is drug-related. My creepy story started a week ago &amp; continues currently.

A family member of mine, Russell.  Zoe has a boyfriend, John, with whom she has been with for aproximately a year &amp; a half. 

I had met John only a couple of times before. Nice enough guy. I knew he had done some prison time (a pretty solid sentence actually but I never knew why until yesterday) but I've never been one to hold judgement over something like that, myself, have no criminal record but I am well aware that the people I do associate with have paid their debt &amp; are moving on as actual productive members of society. I should add that I am an addict in recovery as my friends. Ok, I digress. 

So back to the reception. Russell &amp; I paid our condolences to Zoe who directs us to the kitchen/eating area where there is a sizeable spread of delicious yummy goodness. Russell is taking our food to a table in the eating area while I go to the kitchen to get some cups for some tasty beverages. John &amp; some random guy who has indulged a bit in tasty beverage are in the kitchen so I give John a hug &amp; tell him I'm sorry for what they are going through.

John says, which I think is highly strange for several reasons, largely being that we are at a funeral reception for his girlfriend's (MY family member) father. Not wanting to be rude &amp; giving him the benefit of the doubt, I reply, ""Oh, thanks"" with a nervous giggle. He then says, ""**NO, whistles, ""I need to nope the fuck out of here"".

He continues the conversation with full-blown creepy-eyes. At this point, telling him I need to get back out to my boyfriend. Before I leave the kitchen he says, ""Hey, if you ever need anybody to talk to, I'm always here"". Nice sentiment, dude.

I rejoin my boyfriend &amp; the rest of the day was uneventful. I couldn't shake the strangeness of my encounter with John though. It was just weird to me. 

Fast-forward to yesterday. I had heard of a shooting at some apartments, was searching for the news story on the interwebz when I saw a link to another local news story with a picture of John next to it. I blinked my eyes a few times to clear them, thinking they were playing tricks on me. It was, in fact John.  I clicked on the link to find out he is on the run &amp; wanted for **FORCIBLE RAPE IN THE 1ST DEGREE of a 14 year old girl &amp; that he was in prison for several things including reckless endangerment &amp; ATTEMPTED MURDER**. The US Marshall's are searching for him. 

Holy what the actual fuck.

TL;DR: Family member's boyfriend turns out to be a super-creep on the run from the fuzz.

EDIT: Added TL;DR

Update: Added link to story in comments.

EDIT: My encounter with Zoe's boyfriend happened **BEFORE** the rape &amp; **BEFORE** I read the news story &amp; **BEFORE** he went on the lam (which means on the run

1368566867.0,1eca0u,Secondary school version of 'Single White Female',thenightbattles,163,30,19,"Thankfully

When I was 16 and in secondary school, a new girl joined us and I'm writing her name as 'May'. May was a grade behind me, but said she was really into goth music and simply LOVED the clothing and really wanted to hang out with us. I thought 'the more the merrier' and said it would be a great idea and I was always friendly with her. She seemed very nice, but very awkward and didn't have the best social skills.

That same day, she asked a lot of questions about me, like where did I get my clothes? What bands did I like? What makeup did I use? Over time, I began to notice that May was always VERY interested in what I wore and liked. People began noticing her copying my clothing, hairstyles and makeup. I thought it was flattering, for once, someone thought I looked cool!

Then things got a little weird. I used to make bracelets for friends and I always wore a lot as well. May asked for a bracelet one day and I made her one and she was overjoyed. After school, that they weren't to be trusted and that she was the safest person to be around. I ignored this, but I began having these 'gut feelings' that something was a little off about May.

Unfortunately, May came to school wearing my outfit. I demanded it back and she apologized and said that she had ""found it"". She changed into her own clothing and gave me back mine. Then she began pleading to borrow my clothing, and if I leant her a jacket, she would tell people that it was mine and we were 'so close' that I leant it to her. She had cut her hair at this point and dyed it the same colour as mine, she also began copying the makeup I wore and would try and dress the same as me, like 'twins'.

I had been dating a boy at the time, May began seeing the boy and that gut feeling got a little stronger but I brushed it off, saying it was me being jealous. Then she began calling my house. She would call after school, and in the evening and if she was unable to reach me, she would call back again and again until I was on the line. I had to tell her to stop calling my home because it was tying the line up and my family was quite pissed. After that, she began walking home with me, even though we didn't live anywhere near each other. As for the internet, usually those little surveys where you read about the sender and then fill in the questions and send it back.

She also began to get very clingy, she would either beg them to move, or simply force them and then play it off like a joke. As a joke, a friend refused to move once and said he wanted to stay where he was. She burst into tears and ran away. I felt bad and followed her to the girl's toilets and she was crying and saying that I was her best friend and how dare someone else take her spot?

In October

I honestly didn't know what to do at this point, she stopped coming to school. To be honest, I didn't question anything, I was so happy to be 'free'. I blocked her email address and tried to forget about her. 

The rumour spread through school that her parents had become worried about her behaviour and had her transferred to a different high school.

The rest of the year was uneventful until the summer. School was out and I had gone to a local punk show with friends. While we were waiting in line, had been best friends since we were little kids and we did everything together. In the summer, she got a yearbook from my secondary school and would carry it around and show people at local band shows my picture and tell them about our best friend adventures. This went on for most of the summer and each time, it gave me the shivers.

For a while after that, money issues, etc.).  So, I give her the benefit of the doubt and decide to meet her for drinks, thinking maybe we could be friends.  

She brings up maybe seeing me again, her bar stool), yells at me, and leaves me stranded completely across town, with both of our tabs.  The bartender is pretty concerned, and he allows me to only pay mine.  

Again, hoping that me ignoring her would get the message across.  NOPE. I finally ask her to leave, and she leaves after quite the fuss.

I don't hear another word from her until the next summer.  She calls me up because her dog is missing, she says she's sorry and backpedals AGAIN.  I tell her that there will never be anything between us, and tell her why, and how many chances she's had, and just to leave me alone.  She thanks me, and I don't hear from her until this last Christmas.

I'm at my mom's house in my hometown, she had been doing google searches on one of my internet handles, and she found a porn site where somebody had registered with a name similar to one that I use.  Her exact words:  ""You'd rather whack off to 40 year olds than have sex with me?  Weak,""  followed by cusses, insults, and the like.  I tell her never to contact me again, and block her.  

A month ago, when she magically appears at the table next to me.  She acts like nothing's wrong, tries to engage in small talk, stuff like that.  I act cordial back, because I don't want to be rude, but I scarf my breakfast and book it out of there.  For some context, this isn't the first time this has happened.  She will sometimes show up out of the blue when I'm out at the bars

Two weeks ago

That was until one night when I ended up going out to dinner with a friend and had to take a late train back to my dorm. If you've ever been on the Japanese subway you'll know how crowded the Express trains can get at night and early in the morning, even though it would take about 15 minutes longer than Express. 

So I'm sitting on the train and nothing is out of the ordinary. As the train goes along more and more people start getting off the train until it's only me and one other man in our car. He's just your typical middle aged Japanese businessman, I get a lot of stares being a young American girl in the middle of Tokyo but then the guy starts inching his way across the car closer to where I'm sitting. Still I think, no big deal, maybe he's trying to get closer to a map on the wall. I can still feel his eyes on me and just to be safe I move to the other end of the car, it's more comfortable in the ""Reserved"" seats anyway. 

Then it gets weird. The guy gets up and moves to the exact seat I had just been sitting in. I was kind of grossed out, until he comes back on the train through the door right in front of me and sits directly next to me, looking straight at me and open-mouth breathing on me. I didn't make eye contact and just kind of sat frozen for a few seconds until I realized what was going on. I looked at him like ""Oh don't even try anything on me"" and stood to get up. Luckily someone else got on the train at the same time and he literally bolted off the train before the doors shut and we left.

I don't know what he was planning on doing that he'd risk missing his stop over,False,,t5_2t3t8,1361643676.0,,,t3_19375n

Highschool was a rough time for me, bubblier best friend- So I did what any sane teenage girl would do: I took lots of nudes. I got all the attention I wanted (and more that I didn't want) so all was well. 

I never thought they'd get into the wrong hands

&gt;nice ass

I wasn't the most conservative dresser, if you can believe it, so I ignored it. I'd get one or two of these messages a month, but I'd grown accustomed to deleting them as soon as I got them.

I was broke, back to the window, feet to the aisle. A girlfriend of mine was in front of me, we were talking and gossiping when my phone started blowing up. I had my ringtone set as some stupid, chimey *ding-dong!* I flipped it open and could see my inbox quickly expanding as the *ding-dong!*s continued. It was one message, sent over and over, from the same unknown number.

&gt;You look great today

No one called me 'babe'. I was single. People in the seats near me were starting to give me glares as the *ding*ing and *dong*ing *ding*ed and *dong*ed on. Every time I would try to change the volume, the muffled alerts stopped.

I was on the verge of tears, Alex. A grade above me, and clearly enjoying the prank. When he knew I had seen him, he stopped, apologized, and came to sit by me. We chatted, he told me he didn't know someone was being rude and tried to calm me down. What a guy

We became friends, more playful. He liked to play-fight. Hold my wrists together and tickle me so I had no choice but to squirm and 'fight' it. He'd take my folder of homework, a lunch, my wallet, or my phone and hold it just out of reach. Now that I look back on it, it was his shitty way of showing me that he was in control.

Not one to be outdone, and didn't have much to 'steal'. There was a pencil case he kept in his bag, and that was my target. After a few futile attempts, I managed to snag it, and stuff it in my bag to see how long it would remain before he noticed it. My stop approached, and I exited the bus with his belongings still in my bag. Once I was in the privacy of my own home, I snooped. Opened the pencil case. The contents were pretty average. A few dollars, pens, and a phone. What was he-without-a-phone doing with this little jewel? 

I powered it on, the works. Though, something was off- the contacts were numbers, around 10 or 11. I first went to the media, so see if this really was Alex's. Awkward selfies, you know? But I was greeted with a lot more flesh. Some of it seemed professional- good lighting, nice backdrops. But the majority seemed amateur. With teenage freckles and tan lines and childish underwear and my shower curtain.. 

Yep. I was all over this guy's phone. Not just my ass, I still don't know. But what really bothered me were the indecent pictures I hadn't bothered to share with anyone. My only guess is that he sent them to himself while I was distracted. I felt invaded.   Sick. I had no problem sharing, but he could've asked permission, right? 

The next day I avoided him on the bus

But then

""What the fuck are you doing with those?"" I was livid.

""You were just asking for it

I don't know why I didn't resist more. I know I tried to say 'No', but that wasn't enough. I turned my head to the side, trying to look down into the aisle. I could only see two littler girls up in the front, paying no attention. Coach Johnson wasn't helping much either. 

Alex had pushed my shirt and bra up above my breasts and was playing with them with his free hand and mouth. I'm pretty sure I was crying by then.

""Look

I had turned my head the other way

""I need to go."" I said.

Not 'stop'. Not 'get off of me you fucking pervert'. Just 'I need to go'.

He let go of me and I made my way off of the bus. My mom was worried by the smeared makeup and tears, gossip. I asked about homeschool, and she pulled me out then and there. We never moved, but I never saw him again. My only scare was once when I turned the light to my room on, and immediately heard a crash outside. It could've been an animal, but I don't sleep well when I think about it.

Sometimes, well, my nudes? It wasn't looking good for me. I just hope he hasn't tried it again.

This will be my last post about Artie. I mean, I have a few extra stories that aren't really big enough to warrant their own post. Enjoy!

This first one happened a few days after the time he tried to approach me when I was walking my dog. I had to go to the store to pick up some groceries, forgive me. I love you. -A"" I couldn't move. You know when you're so scared, that you can't really make your muscles do anything? That's how it was. Artie knew where I lived. Creepy. As. Fuck.

The second incident happened when I was at the store with my sister. We were walking down the aisle, not really his fault, but then he started talking to us. Well, more like he started talking to my sister. He kept asking her where different items were located in the store, while staring at me like a creep. My sister had never seen Artie before, so she didn't know it was him. I grabbed her arm and calmly told her in german (german is our first language) that we needed to go, that this was the scary boy. She instantly stopped talking and we walked out of the store and left. Thankfully Artie didn't try following us to the car.

The third was one of the few times he tried calling me. Of course I didn't pick up

The fourth, and not even ten minutes later, Artie posts a status that says ""ImhappyforherImhappyforherImhappyforher"" etc. He tagged me in it. Later, he posted pictures of cuts that he had done on his arm, captioned ""all for her"" I deleted him from my friends list and blocked him right after. Creep.

1357041185.0,15rpig,Crazy ex-stepfather.,taymarieg,166,36,36,"My mom had gotten remarried after her divorce with my dad (happened when I was 3, she didn't really believe us. Side note


Anyways, make fun of me and my real dad all the time and treated me quite unfairly compared to my sister. As if I was just some child that just so happened to live in the same house as him, and not as his daughter. Towards the end of their marriage, things started to go downhill quickly. He would constantly strike up arguments with my mom. Also note, he had pretty much dragged my mom out of mine and my sister's lives. He always loved being the center of attention and couldn't stand when others would have her attention, even if it was her own children. Anyways, there were countless nights where I'd lie awake and hear them screaming at each other in the living room. I later found out that he would threaten to kill himself and threaten to kill her and he would constantly tell her how much of a horrible person she is and all that stuff. 


I remember this one instance where I was sick with a 102 fever and I was laying in my mom's bed (he worked a night shift while my mom worked a morning shift) and she was taking care of me, ""WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING IN MY BED?"" when it was quite obvious that I was sick. Then he proceeded to drag her out of the bed and argue with her until she had to go to work the next morning. And also, while she was getting ready for work (this started at about midnight and lasted until about 6 in the morning). 


This last story caused them to both lose their jobs. My mom had found out that he had been going around telling all our neighbors, where absolutely NOT true. So she was fed up, they started arguing, (this happened while I was at my dad's house, thankfully) and he pulled a gun and put it right at her head while my little sister, who was about 3 at the time, was watching the whole thing. He shot off the gun a few times at the wall in their closet and threatened to kill the both of them. The neighbor ended up calling the police and all of this caused both of them to lose their jobs as cops.


My mom was forced to hire an attorney



Oh, seeking advice on what to do and him saying, ""Get dressed. We're gonna go on a drive.""  Then him driving by my grandparents house a few times before going home. I didn't really see anything wrong with it at the time, seeing as how I was only about 6 or 7, but thinking back on it now, it's quite creepy.


Anyways, we were going to move in with my grandma. My mom had just started really seeing this guy Richard, whom she and Derek had met at a gym (Derek was really into working out, and was often on steroids). My cousin had stayed the night with me one night and we were about to go take her home when I got this super creepy feeling that came over me. I couldn't quite put my finger around it, but I knew something was wrong. I looked out my window, and saw what looked like Derek's truck parked in one of the spots in front of one of the apartment buildings across from ours. I figured I was just over reacting, and that it couldn't possibly be his truck


As we're leaving, and see someone ducking over like they didn't want to be seen. I made the comment, ""that looks a lot like Derek's truck"" and my mom looked, and agreed and said it probably wasn't so we continued driving. We decided to stop at a gas station halfway to my cousins house (we lived about 30 minutes away from her house) and my mom went inside while Richard stayed with my cousin and my sister and I, when Derek pulled up next to us and started screaming at Richard to give him ""his fucking kid back"". My mom races out of the store and jumps in the truck and we take off. Thankfully, we were on a very non-busy road because Derek was trying to ram his truck into ours as we were trying to get away from him. He came so close to actually hitting the car, had it not been for Richard's quick turning (and he would have hit my sister dead on and probably killed her). He cared so much about getting back at my mom that he didn't even care for the safety of his child. Finally he gave up and drove the other way


Throughout the few months that we lived in those apartments, we were packing to move to my grandma's house and found a note written by him, explaining how he was in our apartment and took back a few of his things... None of us had given him a key to our apartment, nor told him which apartment was ours. So creepy.


He's pulled a few other shitty things since then, sister and I got very close once again). But since then, things have toned way down. My sister absolutely hates going to her dad's, but has to since they have joint custody. She's 13 now and can't wait until she's 18 and legally doesn't have to go over there anymore.

1355092792.0,14ki7w,My 'friend' on the bus..,lightonwater,163,29,24,"Age: 17 Gender: Female. First post

This story happened to me a few days ago whilst I was taking the bus to hang out with my boyfriend of 2 years. I've taken the same route many-a-time and never have encountered an issue. 

Sitting down on the bus, he dug around in his all his pockets trying to find the £5.80 return fare for his journey. When he was unable to, the bus driver told him he had enough for a single. The man then shouted at the bus driver to 'take all the fuckin' money!' and proceeded to sit down near me. Now, being the awkward teenager I am, I always sit on the outside seat on buses so that no-one will sit next to me and put my belongings on the seat next to me. 

As soon as he sits next to me he begins mumbling saying 'nothing to fuckin' cry about'. He looks at me and says 'don't you agree?' I give him a polite smile and gaze out the window. As the bus journey begins, he says 'That sounds like a boring place to go on a monday' We begin talking about where he is going and he repeats this over and over: 'whats it like where i'm going? Has it got good pubs and clubs? There's bad people here. My friends are important to me. I have lots of friends where I'm going. As long as you have a good friend, you're ok. Lots of people do drugs here. I don't do drugs. I'm a good guy' I give him another smile, I have one of those big toothy grin smiles, and he stops talking, stares at my mouth and says, 'you've gotta look after your teeth y'know... teeth are important... can't do nothing without teeth' and begins showing me his teeth. Then his demeanor completely changes. He starts saying stuff to me like 'sometimes I just wanna fuckin' end it all. Commit suicide, I have. We could do it together y'know? Like one of them suicide pacts. I wouldn't want to live here. If I lived here I'd commit suicide' etc. 

So, blah blah and I lie about it all. I tell him my name is Lucy Smith, which it isn't, and than I'm visiting my aunt, which I wasn't. And then, another lady got on the bus and he goes mental. He grabs at her, trying to shake her hand, her knee, while I talk to him to try and distract him from her. Until my stop approaches,

I had just been to the bar with some buddies and, and generally horseshit around, as young and wild teenagers do.

Eventually all of my buddies either crashed out or left to go home so I decided I'd better head out as well, drunk off my head, of course.

I cut through a park that's halfway between my buddy and my place, scared to death as to why the hell there as howling coming from a tunnel. The howling would carry on for a few minutes, then stop, then start, then stop. I figured if somebody's in trouble I need to help, and, being as drunk I was

I take a few steps inside, but after about five seconds, the figure of a homeless-looking man (on account of his untrimmed hair and beard) came into view, and, with horror, I realised he was staring right at me.

I lost my shit, so just comforted myself with the safety of TV and Reddit until it was late enough to re-enter society.

1376410960.0,1kaahk,Creeper at work,zizabeth,161,30,19,"I used to bartend at night at this little restaurant in a small town. No big deal all kinds of people came in and we normally had a lot of fun. My two bosses would always come over at the end of the night and sit and drink a couple beers and we'd all talk. 

One night it was me and another girl and she had to leave early so I was there by myself to do all the clean up. We normally closed about 1:30-2ish depending on the crowd and then clean up took anywhere from 30 mins - 1 hour. So I was up there with my bosses cleaning up when a guy came in. It was about 1245 we had been pretty dead that night so I was trying to finish up and head home. The kitchen had closed hours before but he said he was hungry so I offered to go back and make him a sandwich. I figured it'd be fine for him to stick around because my boss was there and he wouldn't be making a mess. I thought he'd drink a beer or two eat the sandwich and skiddadle. 

I gave him his sandwich and started sweeping the floor and wiping down tables and chairs. As I'm working I'm starting to feel a little creeped out so I look up and this guy is watching me in the mirror behind the bar. So I just smile finish wiping my table and go check on him. I ask if he needs another beer or maybe some water and he says no and then starts making small talk. I'm fine to answer his questions cuz hey that's my job. Then he starts asking me what I'm doing when I get off work. Where I live

The guy left and as soon as the door closed I walked over and locked it. At this bar the outside is glass and we have a patio with a fence around it so you can't really see the parking lot on the side. While he was walking away he watched me through the glass the whole time and it really creeped me out. I tried to just laugh it off because I figured I was just being silly. I finished cleaning up about a half hour later and then sat with D and had a beer. My other boss had gone to count money. D was an older fatherly type

I finished my beer and was about to walk out the door, throwing up gravel. I just knew it was the guy who had been in the bar before, it was a small town and the truck was unrecognizable.

1376335409.0,1k84t2,I had a stalker for months,vi0letwaves,147,16,41,"About two years ago, some late night snacks, until he started telling me about his ""girlfriend"". 


This is where it starts to get weird. He kept talking to me about the problems he was having with his girlfriend


So not long after he starts telling me about these problems with his girlfriend (I literally could NOT avoid this guy, he starts hitting on me. Now, I was 25 at the time and this dude is in his 50's. I later found out he went to high school with my uncle. So now I'm really getting creeped out by this guy, but I did my best to minimize our interactions. One night I had a big ass truck with blacked out windows sitting in my parking lot for 5 hours. Truck running, but I never saw the driver. So I called the cops (they used to come in and check on us every night and I was on good terms with them) and I don't know if the truck had a police scanner or what, but right before my two cop buddies pulled up he high tailed it out of there. 


That's when things got really weird for me. Jon came in the next morning and tore my coworker Kim a new one because evidently he was the person in that truck that I called the police on. Then he started following me when I would leave in the morning. Now, they told me there was nothing they could do at this point. So I brushed it off, refused to wait on him, stayed aware, and never took the same route home.  Which worked for a few weeks.


I should mention at this point that Jon runs a mobile mechanic service. Anyway, but I went home hell bent on getting some sleep. I got home and decided to check my facebook before heading to bed. I open it up and see I have a message. From Jon. Who had no idea what town I lived in or what my last name was (and nobody I work with divulged that information - I checked). My facebook settings are ridiculously private and my first name is REALLY common. And what did the message say?


""Need any work done to your car?""


I am not even fucking kidding. Jesus


So at this point I'm thinking that I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands. This guy has been following me around, multiple restraining orders, harassment charges, false imprisonment, trespassing, resisting arrest, violations of said restraining orders... the list goes on. 


This stuff went on for a few months, eventually ended up calling my work and tried to say that I was dealing drugs in the parking lot (I wasn't). That was the point where my job finally started looking into him and his harassment (they still ended up doing nothing). I finally found a new (and much, much better paying) job and things calmed down.

I was at my new job for about six months when I got into a car accident that totaled my car. I bought a new one and it made me a lot more comfortable because I was still worried about Jon creeping around and following me. Which seemed to be working out awesome, always keep my doors locked) and he got out and walked up to my window and tried to get me to get out saying I had a tail light out. I didn't. The car was brand new. 


I tried calling the cops again and getting them to do something and they told me again that they couldn't do anything. At this point I decided fuck it, but I haven't seen him and he hasn't tried to contact me or anything like that since then.

Towards the end of my time there I managed to land a job as the evening front desk person at a small hotel off of I-5 (a major highway) north of Seattle. In my mind I call it ""the Korean hotel"" because everybody there but me was Korean

I was already at my place at the front desk for the late afternoon/early evening trickle of guests to come in the doors
This man comes in looking like a strung out Anthony Bourdain, probably because he stopped in the lobby and stared up at the 70's-fantastic chandelier for a good minute before coming towards the desk.

Once he got there he leaned on the desk and started asking about rooms. I was polite and sweet and wanted to get people in the door to prove myself, or something's wrong and he can't focus because he keeps looking past me to the hallway that leads to the first floor rooms.

I also note as he leans forward that a horrible smell washes over me. He smells like acetone and 1000 proof alcohol, he'll be upstairs and out of my hair soon.

He has, so I did my best to be friendly and get him his key and get him out of there. It *almost* worked.

As he was going upstairs, something happened to his entire demeanor.

""Kelly?"" he said, ""she didn't look anything like you, though. Dark hair, taller. I remember Kelly.""

I had noooo clue how to deal with this

""Man... I really did Kelly wrong. I really did."" He paused a long moment

I replied I really didn't and I hoped he had a good night. But he didn't leave. He dropped his gym bag on the floor and started to fidget right there at the desk, staring off in to space, just twitching and swaying. If I moved, his eyes snapped over to me and he would just say ""I'm really sorry, Kelly.""

So...yeeeah. I was freaked out.

Luckily another couple showed up and he twitched away

I thought that was over and I could go back to reading for the evening.

Nope.

20 minutes later he comes down in to the lobby swinging a baseball bat

""I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you this time. Nobody's messing with you this time

I was completely freaked out at this point, YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFE."" Then back to pacing and muttering.

At that point I grabbed the phone and dragged it as far as the cord would allow in to the back office where I closed the door and proceeded to make a panicked phone call to the police (all the while wondering if I might be over reacting and about to be laughed at)

The police did not think I was overreacting. Unfortunately because I had disappeared, managing a smile for some people who showed up to book a room.

The police showed up rather quickly, I thought everything was over.

Except as they went up in the elevator, staring at the cop cars. He even went out and flicked a cigarette at one before lighting up and walking back in.

When I told the guy he couldn't smoke in the lobby

*Oh fuck*

""Nobody's fucking with you tonight. I'm here. Nobody's touching you, then going outside to pace back and forth and spit on the cop cars.

The cops finally came back DOWNSTAIRS, running out the door and getting him on the ground immediately. He was in handcuffs before I could even blink, and a second later they were retrieving everything, including the bat, from his hotel room.

As they left, as they could only hold him for so long.

1357971246.0,16fcjt,The Man with The Shank,Optickone,158,27,13,"As soon as I found this subreddit I knew I had finally found the 	 appropriate forum to post the most terrifying experience of my entire life. The reason I'm posting this here instead of r/nosleep is because the entire events of my story could have been pretty much a word for word script of a hollywood horror film and I didn't want this to be confused with a work of fiction. Looking back at what happened even I can barely believe it. Anyway here goes...


When I was 16 years old my best friend Odin and his family invited me on a trip to the Costa Del Sol in Spain. Odin's dad had organised a day out quad racing so we had to walk a good distance from where we were staying to get a bus to our destination. The bus stop we were waiting in was situated on the outskirts of an empty parking lot which was being overlooked by a pretty large abandoned building on a slight hill. It was surrounded by shrubs and a run down metal grated fence. The building itself looked almost abnormal


Anyway


As odd as the building was


The floors inside were covered in litter



So a few days later we got up early and told Odin's mam we were heading out for a walk and maybe a swim at the beach. This time as we arrived at the front of the building and for a reason unbeknownst to me I walked up and gave the padlock and chain a shake. To my complete surprise the chain slid off the door handle where it must have been cut with a bolt cutters. Now I know at this stage to most people alarm bells should have started ringing but without hesitation I looked back at Odin with a giant grin and we pushed our way through the giant wooden doors.


The first thing we noticed from this side of the building was an open upper floor overlooking an inside courtyard of sorts. As we headed further towards it I noticed a couple of spray cans heaped on a pile of rubble and this is where the seed of dread slowly started creeping into my mind. As I began rummaging excitedly to find out if any of the spray cans were full something caught my attention. It was barely poking out behind some rubbish so I picked it up to inspect it. After glancing it over I handed it to Odin feeling sick to the very core of my stomach. He looked at it in disgust and flung it back into the rubbish. It was a a set of photos crudely printed onto a laminated sheet of paper in what appeared to be a nude 10-12 year old girl in various sexual positions. Thinking back we should have walked out then and there but instead we shrugged it off and marched on into the courtyard.


We soon found ourselves in the centre of the courtyard taking pictures of more graffiti on a pillar. I looked up and noticed the upstairs was surrounded by an open balcony leading into several rooms. As we were bending down inspecting something my ear picked up the tiniest whisper of what was distinctively the crunch of someone ""sneaking"" a footstep on glass. I instantly bolted up and scanned the surrounding area in a small panic. I had no idea what direction it came from but I knew it was to far to be us. I blurted out to Odin , ""Nevermind, I thought I heard something.""


So we continue our inspection of this filthy rundown courtyard but this time for me the entire atmosphere had suddenly shifted and this fun little adventure had become much more chilling . Since I heard the noise I could swear I could feel someone watching me but as I looked around we seemed to be completely alone. No sooner am I beginning to contemplate telling my friend we should get going an entire flock of birds that had been perched on the upper floor suddenly burst out in a giant ""squak!"" as if they had been suddenly startled by something. Odin turns around laughing holding his heart jokingly


Im quite a paranoid guy so when my friend noticed a way up to the second floor across the courtyard my heart sank. Once again the thought of seeming like a pussy got to me so I agreed to have a quick look upstairs. We climbed up the narrow staircase and with each step it felt like more and more of a terrible idea. From here on out everything happened so fast that I had to slow it down considerably.


When we reached the top of the staircase we walked over to the first doorway. That's when I noticed it. In the middle of the room surrounded by debris and litter was a perfectly placed red leather chair. It was old and worn out but when I studied it more closely I got this horrible feeling that someone had recently been sitting in that very chair. Not in the last month or even week but literally the last five minutes. I know it sounds strange but it looked ""warm"" and slightly creased as if someone had just got up. Just as im about to divulge this information to Odin he shouts


Everyone has felt the feeling im about to describe. As soon as I begin walking to the next room every fibre in my body screams at me to turn around. In that split second and don't ask me how I knew something was horribly wrong. I spun around and was petrified by something that will forever be etched into my nightmares. Odin was still leaning into the room looking for the mouse with his camera glued to his face and just beyond him in the next doorway a man quickly attempts to hide before I see him. He was easily in his late forties with long unkempt grey hair and glasses, big build and shirtless except for a pair of torn cargo pants. Covered in filth head to toe but what had me frozen on the spot was what he was a holding. It looked like he had attached a large metal shank to a piece of wood and as he slid back into hiding I felt nauseous. The scariest part of the whole experience was that it wasn't just some homeless man protecting his territory as I'd expect he would have shouted, made noise and do the usual to try to scare a couple of kids away. 


But instead he was waiting. 


Hiding in the shadows waiting for his perfect moment as we would inevitably walk past him. ""FUCKING RUN!"" I yelled at the top of my lungs running towards Odin and yanking him by the collar. Odin didn't hesitate for a second. He told me after just from the sheer terror in my voice that his brain made the decision for him without even looking up. As soon as I opened my mouth the man with shank in hand erupted from his hiding spot and darted towards us freakishly agile for his size. I felt like shitting my pants


We ran.


I have never ran so fast in my entire life. We barrelled down the staircase almost tripping up over each other in a craze of sheer unadulterated terror. At this point the man was howling something but there was so much adrenaline bursting through my body all I could hear was a constant buzz drowning out the sounds of yelling and crashing. We sprinted across the courtyard and headed straight for the front door throwing our bodies against it as hard as we could. To our utter dismay the door didn't budge. The man was getting closer and closer and thousands of thoughts raced through my head in those split seconds. 


Then at the exact same time we realised we had to pull the door! We flung the door open and burst out into the open running through the fence and out into the car park where we just kept running and running. We didn't say a word to each other as we broke out into a jog.


Even though by this stage we knew he hadn't followed us out of the building our feet wouldn't allow us to stop until we eventually came upon a populated supermarket where was just flung ourselves on the floor and lay there panting. After about five minutes of lying there in shock we abruptly stood up without a word and just walked into the supermarket browsing the aisles. Finally Odin stammered


**TL;DR: Man attempts to creep up and shank my friend and I. Scarred for life but the silver lining is a great story to tell.**

1353646537.0,13njtz,"""Someone who lives with you is with me.""",tetewhyelle,157,26,20,"So this is my first post here and this is possibly in the top 5 scariest things that ever happened to me. I am 19 year old female and this happened in late August-early September 2012. I don't remember the exact date.

As a child my biggest fear was somebody breaking into my house. I don't know why since I lived in a very wealthy and safe neighborhood where break ins very rarely happened. But that was my biggest childhood fear. Not the monster under the bed or a ghost in the closet. I was scared a legit bad person breaking into my bedroom window. 

So, I had work very early the following morning so I had opted to go to bed. It was very creepy being in our condo alone and it took me a while to sleep. It's mostly eerie because we live on the first floor and our bedroom window is on the wall to the left of the front door. There are also a set of stairs not very far from our doorstep that lead to the upstairs condos. I know that doesn't necessarily sound creepy but when you're hearing people walk around outside your bedroom window all night....well you get the idea. 

This one night, thinking it was my boyfriend finally home from work and started to get up to go meet him. (I knew he hated that job and tried to be extra affectionate when he did arrive home) I'm halfway out of bed when I realize the door isn't opening and I hear someone start cursing outside my window. I stopped to listen for a second, thinking maybe I heard someone opening the door upstairs. I heard was sounded like someone trying to jimmy the door and then make a kick at the wall out of frustration. My bedroom wall, right under my window, right next to where I was sitting. Looking back on this, I should have just called the cops right there but my half asleep mind wasn't so intelligent. I thought maybe my boyfriend had forgotten his key or something so incredibly smart me decides to go check it out. (Just like those blondes in the horror flicks) So I get up, put on pants and a hoodie, ""oh shit

I slowly opened the front door and at first I didn't see anyone so I started to close the door, like he had a hunched back, and he was wearing a dirty tshirt, ragged jeans, and carrying a black duffel bag.

""Hey

My initial thought was my boyfriends crazy drug addicted ex-gf was on a trip and thought she still lived here. I started to get pissed but then I remembered she was still in jail so that wasn't possible. As I'm trying to analyze that situation, no other woman besides myself lives here.""

""What? This is 1234 Pretend Address Lane

""Yes but no other girl besides myself lives here."" My voice sounded a lot more confident than I actually felt.

""Well is there another Pretend Address Lane?"" He's about two feet away from me at this point

""No there isn't."" I'm getting the mega creeps and at this point considering calling the police. The way he was protectively holding that black duffel bag told me it was bad news in there.

Our conversation was pretty much cyclic of the above for several minutes and that's when I realized this guy wasn't just a little off, but there are no words and it still gives me the chills to this day. At this point I am getting really scared because he keeps gesturing to the woman in question, but I can't see her. She's not in my view at all. So I'm beginning to wonder if there even is someone with him or if he tried to break in and was covering his ass with this bullshit story. 

I basically decide I'm done with this and go to close the door
My boyfriend walks into view at this point. ""Uh yeah?"" He gives me the ""Are you okay?"" look and I gave him the ""I'm fucking terrified"" look. He gets the message and slides into the space between the guy and myself

Turns out there was a woman really with him. She had lived at the address six years ago and had been evicted, the cop opened it up and found BRICKS of coke. Then not long after that an ambulance had to be called as the woman was overdosing and had been passed out in the grass the whole time the guy was talking to me.  The guy apparently was later to have been found to have a combination of coke, alcohol, and meth in his system. Fucking idiot. To this day, I still get the chills just thinking about it. That guy was high out of his mind, probably had no idea what he was doing and could have done a lot of really bad things.  I'm just thankful my boyfriend and the cop showed up when they did.

I'll never understand why, ""but my daughter will.""

So comes the day of delivery, and both looked like they hadn't showered or washed their clothes in a month of Sundays.

I opened the door and the pair of them just kind of leered at me for a second. Then one says

1340642764.0,vkucn,My stepfather,trixiebix,154,20,43,"Sorry if it’s poorly written
My mom met my late stepfather when I was a senior in high school.

First bunch of years I didn't see anything weird with him. He was a fun guy

At first I would wake up at night and see him looking in my bedroom. I thought weird

He had a house in another state as well
I finally got out (kind of) when I started renting the basement apartment.  My fiancé lived with me. 

When I was around 25,  my mom was in the kitchen, and he was telling me it would be ok, I’d find someone else and he kind of gave me a creepy slow kiss on the cheek. 

Then my mom went away for a weekend, bye” and shut the door. I had to push him back.

One day I was about to take a shower and I thought I saw feet outside my bathroom window (remember I’m in the basement). Like someone was sitting in front of it, and was freaking out… what do I do? He didn’t really have any answers. I considered calling the cops and saying there was a peeping Tom. But by the time I got back to the bathroom he was gone. I saw feet there quite a few times. Now there is no reason for him to sit there but to look in my window. We didn’t ever use the first floors backyard. From then on, I kind of kept my distance. I made sure I was never alone with him. 
About 8 years ago they moved out of state to his other house. So I didn’t have to see him often. They also got married.  I would always make sure I went with my husband because I didn’t want him spying on me. His attitude started to change since he got sick (diabetes with amputations and heart condition). He didn’t joke like he used to and he was always cranky. And he scared me. He owned a gun and I had images of him killing us.

I have always struggled with whether or not to tell my mom. Part of me was afraid of what he would do. He had mafia connections, now he’s sick, he doesn’t have much longer… hopefully”  

He died a couple years ago… and I feel like a weight is off my shoulders. I can visit my mom without fear now. I have only told my dad

1332530779.0,rae2e,A predator in my home(prelude to I owe her my life),Gothichu,159,25,27,"I posted a few days ago

 back in 2005. I figured since the story was successful I'd inform the 

readers of things that occurred shortly after this man tried to break

 into our home. My dog developed a severe mistrust of men after this incident. 

She had to know them very well to be mildly civil around them. 

If strangers walked into our apartment

them
as she'd go for the crotch region almost every time. We couldn't really chide her for her paranoia. 

Those of you that read the story I'd posted earlier would see why she was this way. 

Soon after this event

They began dating. Reggie hated this man

We chalked it up to the near break-in incident and moved on

Reg always had to go outside during these visits. And she was not pleased with this.

She soon began showing her angst against him by finding his boots, or other such shenanigans.

Once again we just explained to Jamie why she had such a great mistrust for men. He seemed to accept and forgive this. 

Soon after my mother and Jamie met
But my mom was at a point in her life where she didn't care about herself anymore

We tried to convince her not to go through with it, and maybe we'd see what she saw in him.

He was off. There was something in his eyes that just made you uneasy.

 Maybe it was just me. As I was just 13

Only Reggie shared in my slight mistrust of this gentleman. 

He was polite enough

Most of the time if one of us expressed our concern for one of her beaus

This time, and dealing with other problems was getting to her. 

I think she kept him around because she was lonely. I wouldn't say I would blame her. Everyone does stupid things for love.

As I got to know Jamie I was odd things about him I didn't like. He seemed to stare too hard

It made my skin crawl. His father was worse. I recall one incident at his parents home

We had gone to visit one afternoon

I was tired

I got up from the recliner to get a drink of water

I swatted his hand away and went to the kitchen. His gaze bore into my back. 

As I walked by again

 And what I mean by grab

I was furious. I wasn't a touchy feely child

I spun on him, because his amusement made me angrier.

"" Don't touch me."" I sad flatly

My mom saw the look on my face and asked me what was wrong. I explained. She frowned at my brief story

Once again

"" DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!"" I screamed

Jamie rose from the couch to ""punish me"" for yelling at his father. Big mistake.

My mom was not mad at me for defending myself. Even if I cursed.

She rounded on Jamie

""Jamie

He looked genuinely shocked. I think it was absurd of him to think that only being with my mom for a short time allowed him to hit us when he deemed fit. 

He was wrong. So very wrong. My mom was the only one who was ever allowed to punish us

""She should at least apologize. She yelled at him in his own house.""

Another mistake. I came nose to nose with Jamie

""Fuck off

I went home

I didn't have a lot of friends during that age. I was shy

The one living creature that really heard my actual opinion was Reggie.

She understood me. At least I thought she did. 

A couple months after the event in question, but everyone she knew pressured her into the marriage, and she stupidly listened. 

We( meaning myself

We continued to live in the apartment at the back of the cafe

My unease towards Jamie and his father never stopped. I never let him see me in so much as a towel. The thought of him seeing me nude made me ill. I kept all my personal items far away from him. And tried to stay out of his sight as much as possible

I soon met Chrissy, trying to keep her away from mine. 

My mom soon came out of her depressed and desperate phase

Her mother Doris, he was a nice man, and Doris was decent. She had some slight bipolar and depression issues, but she was nice enough. 

My mom soon heard of her plight and need for money

She worked for us for two weeks, and she took a trip to Arizona to take care of her. During that time I was back in Grangeville staying with my sisters father. 

We came back

All it said was "" I'm sorry

He denied any knowledge of what the woman was talking about. My mom told him to leave her sight

To our absolute horror

Rather than let him do this

Then

About a year later

http://www.klewtv.com/news/10510562.html 

He had moved in with Doris and Chrissy. They'd married. And shortly after this...he'd gotten ahold of Chrissy. He was molesting and sexually abusing her while Doris was completely unaware. He'd only been caught when Chrissy invited over a friend to stay, and dance for him. The girl went home, and immediately reported this to her parents. 

Her parents called the police. 

I'm sickened that I lived in the same home as this man, he would have. He believed that marrying a busy single mother would be prime opportunity to abuse her teenage daughters. He was very wrong, and he got out quick. 

I knew something was wrong when our dog didn't trust him

Once again she saved us. ",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/rae2e/a_predator_in_my_homeprelude_to_i_owe_her_my_life/
1376499082.0,1kcvyo,Hind sight is 20-20,krissee,161,32,18,"This happened at the end of June and I am still coming to grips on what could have happened!

My husband was out of town for work so it was just the kids and I at home. I was in bed reading Reddit on my phone (this reddit not a good idea when you are naturally jumpy to begin with and an even worse idea when you are jumpy and home alone). I heard some noises outside, turned on my flashlight and looked around.

I call out "" whoever is out there come out, "" I was dared to come steal something from your yard"" That raised warning bells in my head because no one would be that forthcoming... they would try to lie at first at least. I told him that my husband and I don't take kindly to people trying to steal from us and escorted him off my property. He took off running towards a car a little ways down the road and jumped in.

Now this is where it gets really scary. 2 weeks after this incident (a police report was filed AFTER the fact because of my machete) I noticed that the flipper for the BBQ was laying on the ground and I asked my oldest son to pick it up and take it in so I could wash it. He did as he was told and then informed me that he found a knife. I asked where and he led me to the treeline where the would be robber was hiding and pulled out a HUGE butcher knife! I went white and grabbed it by the tip of the blade and put it into a ziplock bag. I called my husband to tell him what I had found and he said to keep it in a safe place until he got home and then we would take it to the police station and turn it in.

Thanks to the finger prints and my description the kid has been caught but only a trespassing charge was laid against him since he didn't steal anything

Looking back and realizing now the danger I was in as well as my boys I should have just called the cops and let them deal with it.

When I was a kid



One day when I was about 8, went in and browsed for whatever an 8-year-old boy would read, checked out a few books, and left the library. 


When I came out, he said, ""Hi, my name is John."" Then, he asked me, ""What is your name?"" I was a stupid kid, so I said, ""I work with your mom, ""Oh


In hindsight, it was 35 years ago, and the most education kids got about this kind of thing was, ""Don't talk to strangers."" My parents were great, but this was just not something people worried about all that much. The abductions of Etan Patz and Adam Walsh definitely did a lot to change the perception, but that is an entirely different subject.


Anyway, he grabbed the bar on the rear of my seat (it was a Schwinn 5-speed with a banana seat. Not sure what you call the bar) to keep me from peddling away.


Now I was scared. I jumped off the back and re-entered the library. I made my way to the circulation desk and asked if I could use the phone. The woman at the desk told me that the phone was not for public use


Happily, I noticed a brown car at a stop sign on a side street. I looked again, and I saw the creep behind the wheel. I realized many years later (and not at the time) that he knew my route home, which means he must have followed me from my house to the library. Whenever I think of this now, it gives me a sick feeling knowing that he could have taken me any time he wanted on my way to the library. I was probably saved by something as random someone walking a dog or grabbing their mail, and he didn't want any witnesses.


I pedaled faster once I spotted him, all the while screaming and pointing at me. By now, I was screaming, too, and moving pretty quickly for an 8-year-old on a 5-speed carrying library books. (No; I never thought to drop the damn books.)


I quickly turned onto a side street, but there was a hill that I could not yet pedal up between my street and I. I got about midway up the hill when I had to get off and walk my bike. He was parked at the very top of the hill, just staring at me.


I literally walked right past him, why he didn't kill me. 


I got to the top of the hill, dropped my bike and screamed for my grandmother (she watched me while my parents worked.)


The creep sped past my house and turned down the next side street. I never saw him again. My parents called the police, that he was balding and about 25-30.

I don't know if he was ever caught, but true), and for the next few years I walked and rode my bike constantly looking over my shoulder, and that I am unbelievably protective of my children.

I don't trust anyone easily, coach, etc., is, ""What is his or her motive or true intention?""

This story takes place in 2007, but more to help us by taking acting classes to develop poise and good public speaking skills. This agency had it's headquarters in downtown Seattle, WA. They had a dress code and basically every class we went to we had to be dressed as professionally as possible. Our family didn't have too much money then, but the outfits we wore made us look wealthy (thank you mom and dad!)

Anyway, but so many people were around that it would be easy to lose someone int he crowd. 

We are waiting at a crosswalk. We are pretty close to a dark alley, and asked for some money. He seemed pretty nice, but we had to tell him we didn't have any money (I had spent the last of it on parking). He said ""oh well, that's ok!"" and smiled.

My little sister was closer to the alley than I was and I was closer to the street. I turned back around to face the street

So what happened was that right when I turned around, most dead eyes I have ever seen in my life. It was like there was no soul behind them. He looked as detached and threatening as a murderer.""

The guy reaches into his inner coat pocket and starts pulling something out. My little sister sees a flash of silver and then realized it was a knife. Now right when the guy looked into her eyes with that dead expression

Now at this time, but I do have a pretty good ""sketchy"" radar. I thought the hobo was really nice, so I thought we were safe. But for whatever reason as I'm facing towards the street, I get this horrible awful sinking feeling in me. I felt scared. Everything just felt wrong. I had this strong unexplainable urge to look towards my sister, and I turn around. I see the hobo still there, hunched eye level to eye level (she's only 5'1""), and holding something towards her. I didn't know it was a knife but it looked like he was going to hurt or grab her. I felt my eyes grow huge and I say loudly and very sternly ""WHAT ARE YOU-..."" As soon as I said that, and turned and ran down the alley.

Part of me was now realizing what just happened. I look at my sister and she is white as a ghost (even super white for a redhead). She looks like she's about to cry

To this day, I made sure that we left early for class so we get the closest parking spot available, and never to let my eyes off my sister downtown again.

EDIT: also wanted to say the worst part was that the crosswalk turned to ""walk"" pretty soon after I turned around.

When my aunt was in high school, was in beauty pageants, etc, etc. As a very attractive young woman, she got hit on constantly, and had older men make inappropriate comments on the regular.

One day, and not really paying attention to her 16-year-old daughter, assuming she could take care of herself in a crowded grocery store in the middle of the day.  Anyway, he starts asking her how old she is, and is that her mom, what are they making for dinner tonight, does she have any sisters as pretty as her, my grandmother notices him talking to her and tells him they have to leave now

Just as my aunt and grandmother are loading groceries into their car, she would call the security guard over. He angrily walked away mumbling about how he didn't mean any harm, glaring at my aunt (sitting in the car) the whole time.  They drove home and didn't think anything of it.

That encounter was weird

After going to bed that night, the person was laying on the floor between her bed and her bedroom door.  If she were to try to run, she would have to get past the person first.

She just lay in her bed for a minute, because she could hear something that ""sounded wet."" Overtaken by fear and adrenaline, she screamed and jumped out of bed, hurtling herself over the mystery intruder and into the hallway.  My grandmother woke up and came running into the hall and my aunt told her what had happened.  They checked her bedroom, but the intruder had left out the window. 

Also, at her house, and in her backyard. The photos were on the floor all around her bed where the man had been laying. 

My grandmother called her neighbor who came over with his shotgun to sit on their porch all night.  The guy was never caught

Big T had two playgrounds – upper and lower. [The lower or main playground is visible from County Road 27.](http://i.imgur.com/ActKZ5s.jpg?2) and has your standard jungle gym equipment, which it usually is in Northern Colorado, we’d oftentimes have our gym classes there so we had lots of room to run, play kickball, or to trip and fall and get sand and small rocks embedded into our skin. I still have scars on my knees. 

Now that you know Big T

I believe my peers and I had finished up with our music class (i.e., we were all laughing and talking to our best friends. We started walking up the stairs (I’ll add the diagram in a moment here) and at the top waiting for us was a man who introduced himself as our substitute gym teacher for the day, since the regular teacher was away.

Do you ever get *feelings* about people, for some reason. My mom is really spot on with her feelings, especially the negative ones. She’s warned me about someone I shouldn’t hang out with because of a bad feeling, and then sure as shit, that person ends up doing something that usually ends with me getting my feelings hurt. 

Anyway, old gym shoes, glasses like Napoleon Dynamite’s, and semi-long dark coat that was probably mid-thigh length or longer. It was weird because it was warm outside, and any gym teacher I’d seen before always wore exercise clothes!

However, but _wrong._ My gut knotted up, my heart started pounding out of my chest, and as his eyes met mine, I felt like a deer in someone’s crosshairs. I wanted to run away, but I couldn’t. No one else seemed to look nervous, so I tried to brush it off. 

It’s been easily 10 years since this happened, he told us to run a few laps like normal. [Here is a little diagram of the upper playground, and where he was in respect to where we were running.](http://i.imgur.com/ENlDofY.jpg?2)

Once we started jogging, the bad gut feeling returned and got exponentially worse with every nearing step I took. This continued the entire time we were running.

I don’t really remember what we were doing in class that day. I think everyone was doing different things in their own little groups. Some girls were playing catch with a softball, etc. so we were spread out all over the field. I was just trying to stay as far away from this guy as possible, and I expressed that concern to my best friend. Of course though, she just _had_ to go to the bathroom and required my company and forced me to go ask the sub with her. 

I was terrified as we were approaching this guy, but I wouldn’t talk to him. As we were standing by him, several times he took a small step towards me with his creepy smile and his hand in his coat pocket. I would step back every time because the hell if I’m going to be within an arm’s length of someone who’s giving me such an awful feeling. He noticed that my friend wasn’t shying away from him like I was, so he took a step towards her so he was standing mostly next to her, but also slightly behind her if that makes sense, and put his arm over her shoulder. I don’t remember any of the dialogue because all I could think about was that his hand was not just on her shoulder anymore. It was slowly inching down towards her chest. I felt so helpless to what was happening. I felt like all I could do was watch in mute horror as this man tried to fondle my best friend. 

She and I made eye contact, and between sobs I was able to gather that she “felt something hard” when he was standing kind of behind her. 

I tried to comfort her, like he did my friend, but she immediately threw his arm off of her and yelled, “GET OFF OF ME!” 

I honestly can’t remember the rest of gym class that day. My friend and I were hiding by the trees and bushes in the corner of the basketball court until the bell rang. 

I do remember that right before class started, and the girl brought us over to the main group of girls. All of us – all the girls in the 5th grade – started talking about what to do. We felt comfortable with the female teacher and felt like we could trust her, so those of us who were in the male teacher’s class asked to go over to Mrs. Teacher’s room because we needed to tell her something personal.

We all told her what happened

She said she’d take care of us.

When I got home, and my dad described in great detail what he would do to any man or boy who abused me in any way. Looking bad, I know for a fact that if my answer had been yes, my dad would’ve grabbed that .45 off the top of the fridge, loaded his kill-me-a-bear rounds into it, and hunted that sub teacher down, at that moment

A while later (maybe weeks or months), but I could be wrong. I said no because I was too afraid of seeing him again, even though he didn’t physically touch me. I regret that sometimes, but IIRC he got a pretty harsh sentence and is probably going to die in prison. Again, I could be wrong because this was 10 years ago, but I believe that he had previously been charged with some creepy pedophile shit and the school didn't do a background check on him before letting him sub. I don't know if any lawsuits ensued. Maybe I'm making things up. I barely remember, but my parents said I was afraid to leave the house because I thought I’d see him and he’d hurt me for telling on him

I’m sorry this is so long and rambling. I can’t remember the guy’s name for the life of me. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to find any article about it

**Long TL;DR – When I was in 5th grade, negative gut feeling and I felt like I was being preyed on. It was pretty creepy. I’m thankful for the good instincts I have and I’m glad I avoided him, but I hope all of those girls in my class haven’t suffered any lasting damage. We all told my teacher what happened, and I assume she called the police and reported it and called parents. I can’t find any articles, but IIRC, the man received a harsh sentence. Will provide more information if anyone is interested in finding articles online.**",,,,

So depending on whether they call me back or not

story:

I was on a cross-country road trip, even the major highway was pretty desolate. There had been a truck stop or gas station about every hundred miles, and every one of them was solitary with no other buildings in sight.

These weren't really towns

It was pretty late at night, and you learn from road travel to fill up when you get the chance. So she was looking for a gas station as we drove along. 

It's really corny but we were talking about fate, so I was trying to change the subject. She took an exit  while we were talking, and I got out my coffee mug so I could fill up for my turn driving. We pulled into a typical nowhereville gas station- just the station and a trailer out back (I assume thinking back it was probably where the people who owned it lived). There was another car parked in front of the doors off to one side.

We got out, each of us grabbing a door handle. 

The doors were locked. I turned and looked around to see if there was a sign (sometimes places will put up a ""back in 5 minutes"") and noticed several things in succession; the coffeemaker in side was half-way done brewing a fresh pot of coffee, but all of them were showing static, and there was a splash of bright red on the door in the back of the place, which was closed. I suddenly realized I was looking at a huge streak of blood, with handprints in it.

Every hair on my neck stood up. My friend began shaking the door

""We have to LEAVE. NOW"" I grabbed her arm and started propelling her back to the car. Now I noticed the other car in the lot. It had no plates. It was dingy and had dents. There was an empty gun rack in the window of it. I ran to the car

The whole time she kept saying

after what seemed like a year she pulled the car out. when we were backing up

I freaked out until we were twenty miles down the highway. I tried to call police but had no signal, just a building on its own in the middle of nothingness.

I called the cops, we probably would have met the robber- or whoever was in the back room of the place.

I also wish I had been able to find out what the hell had happened there. It was a Chevron station, on RT 10)

When I was 10

One day during summer vacation, and the occasional nice person on a bike or out for a walk. It was going great and we had actually made about $10 each, which was a huge deal to 10 year olds!

Around 4pm we were getting bored and decided to start packing up. That's when a man in a pickup pulled up to our stand and asked how much for lemonade. We told him 50¢ or whatever we were charging and he said he had to go home and get money

Ten minutes later he came back, warning bells, but again, greedy. He yelled out to us to bring him the lemonade, and to pass it through the passenger side window. 

Erica and I lined up next to the car and she reached in to pass him his cup. She immediately froze

I live in Calgary and was on my way home from a job interview today when this happened (it went great, Calgary has a pretty sizable homeless population and it's not uncommon for them to ""ride the rails"" to seek refuge from weather or to just pass the time, so I'm used to dealing with these types of people. In fact, when I moved here I found it strange how these people were so friendly. Most of the homeless I've run into here were generally really nice people and never do the whole ""Got some spare change? no? fuck off"" and will often just strike up a conversation. 


So here I am, resting his hands on his lap flipping the bird. Now, at this point I'm not about to say anything, but he begins cursing and swearing randomly. There were children on the bus so I said something to the effect of ""hey man, there are kids on here"". Big mistake. Buddy turns and looks at me and does a throat slitting motion at me and says ""I'll fucking kill you, kid"" to the shock of everyone on the train. I'm no coward but I'm not about to argue with this obviously mentally unstable individual. Whatever. So I just sit back and watch the show. The guy continues the throat slitting motion, but now it was like some kind of nervous tick. He kept rubbing his face and then making the throat slitting motion at no one in particular and straight up blubbering gibberish. He got off the next stop and just fucking *smashed* one of the windows in the train with his hand and looks at me through the door and started spitting out obscenities and threats (I couldn't really hear him over the commotion of people exiting the train). At this point I was thinking ""fuck this guy, but it felt great. 


So buddy is outside the train hollering and cursing and calling me a bitch, flip him off and mouth the words ""Fuck you, douchebag"" Buddy goes *absolutely fucking bananas* and starts kicking the train while it's locked down and tried to keep pace as it started pulling out of the station.

1363588670.0,1aifwn,He would disconnect my internet connection,,164,32,30,"I would like to start off by stating that I am a 27 year old female.  I’ve had quite a few creepy experiences happen to me while growing up in my old neighborhood during the ‘90s and 2000s.  One time I was in the 8th grade, seeking shelter and food in peoples’ sheds (ours’ included).  Why she threw rocks near my window

However the scariest thing that has happened to me while living in my old neighborhood was about 7 years ago when I was a sophomore in college.  At that time, maintaining a blog, chatting on yahoo messenger and posting on forums.  Even enjoying porn every so often (a girl has needs).  Typical college student stuff.  So I made full use of my laptop at this point in time, and I would be up late at night, sometimes until 2 or 3 in the morning.  

Well one night I was up late on my computer.  I was updating my blog when all of a sudden my internet connection was cut off.  I looked at my modem and I noticed that my “Sending” light was on but my “Receiving” light was off.  I figured something was wrong with the internet provider and assumed it would be fixed by tomorrow.  I was wrong.

The next day my internet was still down.  It didn’t make sense that the cable was sending data but not receiving any.  My dad went outside to investigate and he noticed that where my cable had been connected to the cable box that it had been unscrewed off.  My dad said that someone must have tampered with the cable and removed it from it’s original location but we didn’t understand why.  Was someone trying to steal our cable?

A few nights later while I was on the computer the same thing happened.  My internet connection had been disconnected and the modem couldn’t receive any data.  I was completely frustrated at this point because all I cared about was that I wasn’t getting my internet.  Then I had remembered that my dad had told me it had to have been someone who had fucked with my cable outside.  It was after 1 a.m. and I was sitting at my desk on my laptop.  I had two windows in my room.  One facing towards the right side of my desk and another in front of my laptop.  Both windows had blinds but no curtains.  I had been too afraid to look outside either window so I went to the garage to peek my head into our backyard from my garage door.  Looking into our backyard I would have been able to see if anyone was standing near the window that was on the right side of my computer.  I could not see the anything surrounding the window facing my laptop because that window faced the other side of the house

So I peered outside and quickly surveyed the backyard.  I didn’t see anyone standing near the window that wasn’t facing my laptop.  I felt temporarily relieved

It could have only been maybe within 2 seconds, or something that had caught on fire.  I panicked and ran back inside the house, locking the garage door behind me.  I quickly went to find my dad watching tv in the living room and I frantically told him what I had seen.  He went to grab a bat that he had kept in the garage and quietly had gone outside.  I just stood there at the front door, waiting in trepidation and fear.  It had felt like hours when my dad finally came back.  He had not seen anyone or anything standing outside that window, but he had to connect my cable again because it had been unscrewed from the cable box.  I felt so fucking confused.  What the hell had I just seen?!  Had it just been a figment of my imagination?  And if no one had been at my window, why did my internet keep disconnecting?  How was the cable getting tampered with?

Frustrated and tired

I saw a man standing outside in my neighbor’s yard, just standing there staring at me while I looked back at him in horror.  That’s when I realized it was my neighbor.

I fell back away from the blinds and I told my dad what I had seen.  I don’t know why my dad hadn’t seen the guy but I assumed he just didn’t look over into our neighbor’s yard when he went to see who was at my window.  While I was in school the next day, but when I saw him standing out there in the dark, looking at me with that smirk on his face I knew it was him.

My sister and I discussed what had happened and we tried to understand why he would disconnect my cable.  She thought he could have been trying to get me off the computer so I would change and go to bed.  And I didn’t comprehend at the time why he was wearing a towel.  I figured he had just showered and that’s what he was wearing when he decided to watch me outside my window.  It’s not until recently that I came to the conclusion he was wearing a towel so he could jack off while standing outside my window.  And if that isn’t disgustingly creepy enough

Soon afterwards my mom got me some dark curtains to put over my blinds and I was so paranoid I even hung towels over the windows.  I think I had them up about two years at least before I took them down.  I thought that was the end of that,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_1aifwn

I turn around and there's this black guy, ""My auntie lives right over there and I don't want her to catch me hiding this weed, can you watch my back? I'll give you $20."" 
Let me tell you that I handled this very badly and I was not even interested in the $20. I don't know what made me do this, very confused. Things start to get really weird when he starts mumbling something about my legs hurting and that I must be tired and I should sit down and take my shoes off. I argue ridiculously that my legs do not hurt. He says to act like they do and sit on the curb so that his auntie does not suspect anything. 
I think, he convinced me that my legs do kind of hurt. I am talked into sitting on the curb and taking my shoes off. I was wearing flats so I just flopped them off. I sat there for about half a minute before I started thinking to myself, ""What the hell is going on here?""

I got up and slipped my feet back into my shoes. He starts mumbling something about ""now I'm getting frustrated"" and I peace'd out of there. When I got home I told my boyfriend at the time the story and he and my roommate were very angry with me for letting it go that far. After all

Months later my boyfriend (at the time) was at a party listening to this other girl's story of when she got creeped out

That was 2 years ago. Then, he prefaces it by saying ""Man, I don't even want to tell this story because I handled it so badly but here goes..."" and I'm thinking in my head, ""Yeah, I had a time like that once. That guy who got me to take my shoes off and sit on the curb..."" and then he says... ""So I was riding my bike back from a get together and this guy stops me and asks me to watch his back while he hides this weed..."" He didn't get too far into the story before my jaw dropped. At the end of his story I told him that it had also happened to me and we filled in the blanks for eachother and it was very bizarre. 

Same exact lead-in with the Auntie, take your shoes off. ""I'm getting frustrated."" etc. He said that it was 4 months ago that this happened to him, and that *his friend* also shared the same story *with him* that happened to his friend about a year ago. He said that his friend sat there even longer and the guy started asking for sexual favors and things of this nature before his friend fled.

So, that I've heard of. I didn't think much of it when it happened other than ""glad I got out of there"" but now that I'm older I wish I would have reported it. If it's happened to other people that I have heard about who knows how many more there are.

I live in Singapore. We're a small island and pretty uneventful! When I was 16

Now - I **used** to believe in this sort of thing, and it had a bit of a crowd milling about on the other side.

It was a little strange - he took barely five minutes with each of my three friends, I can barely look back at myself without smacking myself on the head.

He started with a simple mind-reading trick: he would ask us a question, he would have us say the answer aloud so (on hindsight) I realized that he would actually be writing down the answer to the question that he asked first after we told him what it was, and make up the last answer. He would then show us his piece of paper at the end, and be like ""look @ diz I got it right"". 

He totally did that - I was so impressed that he only made one mistake at the end - which was predicting my dad's name. I thought he was pretty legit.

**Here's the creepy part**:

Maybe a couple of minutes after that, then abruptly dropped it. He looked me in the eyes and said ""do you touch yourself...there?""

I was

""Don't lie to me. I know you do.""

""No...uh no.""

He started to frown. ""I know you do. Don't lie. Show me how you do it.""

What?!

""Um...I don't...know? No?""

""Does it feel good?""

""I'm...no. No?""

He stared at me for a little while - he looked frustrated - and then re-continued reading my palm. I was unnerved and said I had enough.

Before he let me go, sorry. He asked again, and again, and again. I declined each time, and began to walk away. He looked peeved, then warned me:

""Touching yourself there is very dirty. You should stop doing it."" I nodded a couple of times then walked away. He stood there for a pretty long time, on to another customer.

He didn't ask my friends anything like that - he didn't touch their hands either. I have no idea why he targeted me - I was severely overweight, am pretty fit and not as easy to fuck around with.

On a lighter (and slightly unnerving) note: He told me that I would end up dating a white man when I turned 19, I met this pretty cool guy and we've been dating three years next month. He's a dorky white boy, and my first boyfriend.

TL;DR: Creepy guy reads my fortune (somewhat accurately) and asks me if I fap, he said to stop doing it, I'm still confused.

After graduation I had to move back to my crappy little home town with my parents. This city has never been a place you could feel safe in, I had grown compliant and trusting towards the mass of strangers I called neighbors.

My parents have always been paranoid about home security, feet out the window, headphones on high, with a wifi connected phone in my hand. If no one is home to open the door, I'm stuck there. I was supposed to have lunch with an old friend from high school, but she canceled last minute. That left me looking forward to at least 5 hours of driveway redditing while everyone I knew was working or out of town.

About three hours in I noticed a pick-up pull up on the other side of the street. It wasn't someone with a key to my house so I went back to killing zombies with vegetables. Fifteen minutes passed and I got this really uneasy feeling. I finished  up my level and glanced at my mirrors. 

I nearly peed. A man was standing in my driveway

He was gangly, and had the creepiest smile I'd ever seen. I could tell by the pick marks and rotted teeth he was hooked on more than just phonics, and he was flying pretty high for 3pm on a Wednesday.

""I didn't mean to scare you

""Oh no

""I'm sorry, but don't live here.""

I was still a bit flustered

""I'm not sure I'll be able to follow that. It's a bit complicated. Could I just follow you there? I'll pay you gas money for it."" 

Now I'm really getting creeped out. He never dropped his smile, trying to let him know I'm done talking and that he should leave. ""It's really easy. One right and two lefts, it'll be on the left. You can't miss it."" 

He was silent for a few seconds longer than normal

I was not prepared for this question, so I started scrambling for some excuse. ""I left my key and I'm just waiting for my mother to get home."" As soon as the words were out of my mouth I remembered the big rule my dad used to tell me when I had to be in public by myself: Never let them know you're alone.

His smile somehow stretched

""It'll be on the left."" I began to shrink back into my upholstery ""I promise.""

""Well it doesn't sound very far. I guess if I can't find it, that smile still in place. Twenty minutes passed before he left.

I decided that Mickey D's Internet was just as good as my own and hunkered down in the parking lot until I got called home.

Three weeks passed and I had forgotten about the tweaker creeper, and I waved back.

My dad was the coolest guy on the block, wore Oaklies before the hipsters and he was generally a rough-sounding person. Damn do I miss him.

But the one thing he feared the most was Halloween. He would tell my sister and I stories at night about his life when he was in high school in slum in New Jersey

When Halloween would roll around, Lexi and I were dressed as a witch and '50s poodle skirt girl. Dad held our hands, walking to the last street when I realized I'd lost Moms scarf she'd let me borrow. She loved that thing, so we walked all the way back towards this darker corner of our street. It's by the woods and a small stream, but when it's dark you can't see anything.

Dad said he'd seen something and walked towards it. When he got there

Lexi called out to him if he found Mom's scarf. He told her to be quiet, we stood there, waiting. I could make out the scarf above his head, tied to a branch. He grabbed the scarf tied, still staring in the dark, and started backing away. Then Dad screamed and sort of shuffled backwards. It was a low, throaty scream like he was furious. He was swearing, but I don't remember what.

Whatever Dad had been staring at then bolted out of the trees and ran down the street, Dad yelled for us to stay back. He got onto his (ancient) cell phone and called Mom to come and pick us up. His next call was to the local police.

We left before we could see anything, they'd taped off the place and taken out the bloody animals, but there were stains on the pavement and the smell was pretty bad. The kids talked about it in school a little, and I was curious if they ever caught the boy. Nothing came out in the local papers, though, and it was quickly forgotten. Eventually, Dad could have told me more

This was one story she told me regarding taking the subway late at night.

A number of years ago, and was waiting for the train.  As she she got down to the train stop she realized that she was the only person there.  Not really thinking about it too much she stood there waiting for the train alone.  After a few minutes go by some random guy comes down to the subway stop as well.  She doesn't really think much of it but all of the sudden this guy starts acting creepy.

As soon as he gets down to the subway platform he says something to my mom like ""hey baby looking good tonight""

My mom doesn't turn around

The guy starts to move closer to her saying

Still my mom ignores this creepy.

Again he moves within a few feet of my mom saying

Mom ignores him

Finally he gets close enough to my mom and punches her in the shoulder saying ""hey b*#@$ I'm talkin' to you.""

We were just hanging out during the summer, and to cut some time off, we went through the back of the middle school to get there. When we were behind the school, we passed some older kids, probably 16, smoking cigarettes behind the school, and we didn't pay much attention to them. I remember the one kid vividly though. He was really short, and he wore super baggy clothes. Like XXL sizes on a kid who would fit into a small, and he had a reputation for being a thug.  
Anyway, bought our drinks, and started home, the same route we had taken to get there. We passed the guys again, and they asked us if we wanted to buy some weed. Neither my friend or I have ever been smokers, so we just laughed, said no thanks, and we started to notice a jingling sound behind us, but we took a sharp turn and increased our pace to get away from him.  
He still followed us. At this time, so I pointed it out to my friend, and he suggested we go into the woods. Now these woods didn't go anywhere, just backed up to some houses, so we knew that if he went in after us, he was for sure following us. So we ducked into the woods, and sure enough he followed.  
So we did what any smart kids who grew up in the woods and knew how to handle them would do, and he had pulled his hand out of his pocket, and he was carrying a giant chefs knife! This thing was probably a foot total, with at least an 8 inch blade. We were coming up on an embankment down into a creek, and it was around this time that I realized that I was still holding my Icee. So I got to the bank, looked down, saw it was probably a six foot drop, launched my drink at him, we turned around and there Kurt was
When I got to highschool, and Kurt was still tiny. He tried to start something about it once, but I socked him in the eye and that was the end of that. Last I heard, Kurt was serving time for assault and possession with intent to sell.

1370725498.0,1fy1pn,Park encounter.,PerpetualAmnesia,155,25,25,"I was around fourteen/fifteen when this happened and am female for anyone who wants to know. There was a park where I used to go whenever I had a row with my parents (which was often). This meant that I could turn up there in the middle of the day or the middle of the night



I tended to sit on a bench which was right at the back of the park by a wooded area as I didn't want anyone to see me crying. Of course I realise now how stupid this was



This guy came and sat next to me, shorts and black gloves. He might have been around forty, or maybe a bit younger, but I have always been rubbish at reading ages, so not sure. He was about 6ft 5 and quite stocky, bit fat. 



He asked me what was wrong, 6ft 2) and then kind of laughed really creepily and said something like, 'I'm bigger though'. 



I always tend to listen to my instincts and he was reading about a 7 on the freak o meter, but it was one of those that don't reach your eyes, so you just look creepy. He asked me to sit back down and tell him what was wrong, but I just said that my dad was waiting for me and I had to go.



He then said that my dad wasn't waiting for me and that he'd seen me walk into the park from the main road by myself and that liars get punished. I just turned and ran. In those days I was pretty quick



I got to the other side of the park and turned around to see if he was nearby



Neither one of them attempted to chase me and I ran out onto the path that led to the main road. There was a van parked in the car park



When I got out to the main road it was fairly busy for that time of night and I stopped running. I decided to go home, but I think there were two people inside. I was afraid to go home then as I thought they'd know where I lived and my parents often left me on my own as they were neglectful douche bags.



I knocked on the first door I saw and thankfully an old lady answered. She took me inside and called the police. By the time someone came the van was gone.



They never caught either of the guys from the park (not sure how hard they looked as they hadn't specifically done anything) and I hadn't thought to take a note of the van license plate or anything like that. I still have no real idea what they had planned

Basically, a U-haul storage lot to my immediate 9 o'clock, a self-storage place to my 6 o'clock, and the apartment complex to my 4 o'clock. I didn't think it would be an issue at all, and despite its slightly sketchy location, I'm living with two pretty large guys, so, everything was going well, and my boyfriend

During the day, just doing general moving-in stuff. The cable guy was coming, etc. We noticed on our first run that there was an extremely run down white van in our driveway. Now, the driveway isn't really a driveway, but more like a gravel lot. Nevertheless, it's our gravel lot, and it affords us plenty of parking. For the time being, he'd move his van to the apartment parking lot, he ZOOMS back into his spot, again about an hour later. He begins backing up

We're irritated, setting up the house, doing some cleaning. It's me, James, his friend Katharine who is staying for a few days before her summer lease starts, and my boyfriend. We walk into the dining room, which has two double windows that directly face the apartment complex. We ALL stop short. Our neighbor with the van is standing at his window with his blinds open, staring into our house BLATANTLY with his fingers pulling the blinds apart so that he can see better. We all freak out just a little, okay, I've had issues with harassment before

Eventually, I go to the realtor's to drop off my rent check for May. I talk to the owner of the house on the phone about a few repairs, and mention the van. The owner says I can leave the van owner a note asking them to move their car off of private property. I honestly probably wouldn't have cared if he hadn't scared us so much the night before, but at this point I just want him off our property with no reason to be near my house. I write the note as soon as I get home with the help of my boyfriend and roommate, as the van is parked directly in front of my house. We make it polite-- We tell him that we understand he's been parking there while the house has been unoccupied, but now that we're here, we'd like to have our entire driveway free to use. My boyfriend goes and puts it out under his windshield wiper. My boyfriend is barely back inside before the van owner comes out with his massive wife. He becomes VIOLENT. Screaming obscenities at our front door, screaming that he will not be disrespected by kids like us

About 10 minutes later,"" etc. More was said but I don't remember. Our landlord comes over and informs the man that it is private property and that he cannot park there. They negotiate so that he can park at the end of the gravel lot for a few days and then he must move it. I'm not happy about this arrangement, but okay. During my landlord's conversation with the neighbor, he threatens us and tells us that he will be watching our house and that he will be calling the police on us if he sees alcohol. 

We honestly are just really freaked out by the violent explosions from him. While we're not concerned about the police (we're all 21 and won't throw parties here since it's farther away from campus)

We're not exactly sure what to do here. I suppose we just wait and see. James and I are considering going to the police to maybe get an incident report filled out in case this escalates

And he'd say, and he got very mad, turning red, and got so close to my face I could smell the beer on his breath. I thought he was going to tear me apart. He went and got some beer instead.

Once he made me lie in bed with him and watch a Disney movie with him while he touched my legs very slowly and softly, sweating. He would rub himself on me and as a young kid I just remember him rubbing on me, making a strange noise, and getting up to go to the bathroom. 

He also used to give him long hugs and he would make me

He took me for ""walks"" and told me he wanted seven wives to kiss and touch all parts of his body

He would show up at my house when my mom was away and sit and ask me strange questions and if I'd like to shower for him. As a young child I didn't understand. I was terrified.

I moved to inner-loop Houston (the 610 loop is a freeway that unofficially separates the metro core from the residential/industrial outskirts of the city) to a small historic neighborhood- the Montrose district, young people, gays, etc. Montrose is pretty socially liberal and probably the most ""out there"" Houston neighborhood, culturally speaking. Lots of cool antique rental properties and garden apartments for singles and couples in their 20's, but not the kind of area that most people can afford to purchase a house or have the space for a family. 

I was very young when I first moved to Montrose, music clubs, coffeeshops, street fests, proximity to the museum district, it was great, but every pro has its con. 

Montrose wasn't super scary crime ridden or anything

Drugs were easy to come by (which meant a high concentration of drug users, car break-ins were relatively common (my window got smashed twice in 4 years, which seemed about the average.) 

There was a decent sized homeless population to be berated by- don't get me wrong, shameless, and persistent.

Additionally, I don't see any cars parked on his side of the lot, and no one's around for him to interact with, so his movements seem aimless and random.

He sort of glances my way, fixating on one point of the parking lot, then he quickly strides to that empty spot, and then he finds another spot a few feet away to look at and then skitter to. I don't feel threatened, but I'm definitely aware of his presence (and questioning his stability.)

I make it into Walgreens undeterred, blocking my path. 

He asks me if I have any money I could give him. He's older and pretty worse for wear. I feel bad for him, I don't carry cash. 

I step around him and keep walking, a hair away from breaking into a sprint.

My car was just your standard 4 door, he leans down so that his face is just about level with mine. His hair and beard are unkempt, his eyes are wild. As if I needed further confirmation, (I didn't) this is not a sane individual.

One day, there were a lot of people, and workers seemed overwhelmed. My dad and I waited our turn for our number to be called  on a couch located in the back of the room. There were TVs to watch, I think one of them had nickelodeon on, so I didn't mind the wait.

Finally, because he ended up waiting longer than he bought he would. 

As my dad left for the counter, one came over. He was nervous, kept checking back to his friend for approval. Finally he reached me and asked in a shaky voice, ""is anyone sitting here?"" I just simply replied, ""my dad, but he's up at the counter now."" and the man sat down. 

I was a tall child, to add to the collection. They would stick out of the bottoms of our pants for the world to see.

One time, my little self was in one of the shower stalls.  You know the kind, concrete floor, with cheap plastic panels dividing the other stalls from each other and the hall.  Since the plastic panels weren't fixed in place, there was about a 6"" gap from the wall to the panel.  

I knew there was someone in the shower next to me, etc.  Yay growing up.  Feeling nervous, I leaned back in the shower to try and see through the gap.  

Peering back at me, he kind of jumped and quickly disappeared from my sight.  My heart was pounding and I immediately felt like I was in trouble.  As a child, I automatically assumed I had done something wrong and he had caught me and would tell my dad I was peeking on him in the shower.

The creepiest thing I ever heard him say before stories came to light was when he told a lad that he had 'young boys bodies in the groundsman's shed' and that he'd be joining them if he didn't do as he was told. Now obviously he didn't as they'd have been found

One time, where he had the jumper in the boot. I did, and was alone at his car with him, until someone else came out of the pavilion and got something out of their car. He sold me the jumper, and I returned to the pavilion. It seems an innocuous event at first, but when later events came to light it appears that the person getting something out of their car could have saved me from experiencing John's sick machinations. 

I had a second brush with Little Hitler, at times a problem, but this time to my immense benefit. Shortly after passing his house, John pulled up in his car alongside us and said to my mother 'Oh there's no need for you to walk all that way, here, why don't you let me give him a lift to school?' As at this time nothing had come to light regarding him, it would have been easy to assume that the offer was him being kind. Fortunately, my mother sensed something amiss and said that she'd walk me the rest of the way as she 'had to meet a friend up that way anyway.' Without saying a word, the events didn't seem as innocent and kindly as they first appeared.

One day, however. John had been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing minors. Prior to being a cricket coach, he was affiliated with the Sea Cadets. Apparently, he'd abused young people at sea - the extent of the abuse I do not know, but apparently it left the victims extremely disturbed. I'm pretty sure, although this is just my opinion, that there must have been many more victims too scared to come forward, or fear of being ridiculed or not believed.

Time went by, and we were kept 'out of the loop' unaware what was happening. In fact, I'd almost forgotten about him, until one day. I was sat in the living room with my Dad, and he was reading the paper. He called my Mum over and showed her a particular article. She expressed shock, then said 'I heard alarm bells ringing from the moment I first saw him'. This piqued my curiosity, and I asked to see the article. There, was John's face staring out of the paper. Below was an article detailing his offences, and the stranger who emerged from the pavilion for his perfect timing. It feels strange to know just how close I came to being a victim, I'd just like to urge Redditors with kids to be extremely careful with who you trust around them - no matter how friendly or helpful they may seem.

I Have Arnold–Chiari malformation, my friends had convinced me to just take a lot of ibuprofen to counteract it before hand, so that's what i did. We had all decided to go to a large spring, which is used by the locals for swimming since its pretty deep. Our whole group decided for a little friendly competition to swim from one side to the other, just for shits and giggles. I wish it would have remained so light-hearted. Me, being the person i was, ( I took swimming lessons for 11 years and was on major swim teams in my county) I made it first and was flaunting it by waving to the rest of our group, even the most athletic of us were only 2/3 the way there.


Anyways as i waited (its a very forestry/natural place, but much more sinister and forceful. I tried to kick and scream, but my strength was slowed A LOT from the amount of ibuprofen i took to counteract my Chiari. He had a rusty box cutter and it was resting dangerously on my throat. As i was struggling, he pulled my face closer to his and said ""I could kill you right now, i'd enjoy every minute of it."" I was still forced on his lap, as he was strangely petting my hair like a small child. Thankfully, one of my athletic friends finally made it across and started rustling though the bushes to come get me. As soon as the man heard my friend call my name


I collapsed into my friends arms and sputtered and spit and cried out my words. We went home and tried to file a report with the police/guards that own/patrol the springs. Minutes after we left their cabin, being that close to death and not having it even in fate's hands, but those of an evil human being.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1hexhw/id_enjoy_every_minute_of_it/

One summer day, but I hadn't left yet. Out of nowhere, my dog started barking and second later, I heard footsteps on the deck by our front door, and the doorbell rang. I peered out another window to see who was outside, thinking it was maybe the neighbor boy coming over to ask if I could come outside, which he did almost daily


It was a man, so anyone over 14 looked like a grown-up to me. There was a bike in the driveway that he must have arrived on. My dad hadn't come to the main room yet, so I started to go towards the door to see what this guy wanted. I was just a kid, and like I said, the neighborhood was always safe so I didn't think anything of it. I knew not to talk to strangers and all that, but since it was at my own house and my dad was there, I figured I could answer the door. Before I got there, looked out a window at the man


He only opened the main front door and not the screen door, that's oddly specific. It was also summer, remember. No school. I heard my dad lie and say no, it was just him and his wife living there- no kids. The man at the door seemed confused and asked my dad if he was sure he did not have a daughter in the house. My dad just told him to leave and get off his deck, and he left. I saw him ride down the street on his bike from the dining room window.


As a kid, even if my parents were home. Looking back, I realize the man, whoever he was, must have been watching me play outside for who knows how long. He was certain there was a little girl in the house. He asked specifically about a daughter, rather than just kids in general. I also feel like he wasn't expecting my father to answer the door. At that time, my dad worked night shifts and would come home at 7 or 8 in the morning, and was staying up that day. I think this man might have known my dad worked night shifts


To this day, and that I hadn't gone outside to play yet (I stayed home that day at my dad's request). I never saw the guy again after that; he never tried to come to our house again, to my knowledge, and I never saw him around the neighborhood. I have no idea who he was, how he knew about me, or what could have happened to me if I had ever met him myself. I'm glad I don't know these things.

1367093037.0,1d8dn1,"""Do you know where Sarah is? Where is she?""",JumpsTheTurnstiles,145,22,21,"I discovered this subreddit a couple weeks ago and have enjoyed reading everyone's stories

I live in a two-family house with my mom and 5-year-old sister

It was 1 AM when I was sleeping in my room. I was fast asleep, but still laying down with my blankets on and everything. I had heard a man's voice. It took a second for my eyes to get adjusted to the dark, and I saw a tall figure in a heavy coat and a beanie just standing at the foot of my bed. I was completely terrified and I couldn't move.
The guy was just staring at me. He said ""Sarah?... Sarah?"" It took me a second to be able to make any sound. I was too scared to scream so I'll I could say was ""...what?"" He just kept saying ""Sarah?... Sarah...? Do you know where Sarah is? Where is she?"" I eventually mustered up the strength to say ""There is no Sarah here. I don't know

I keep a knife in my bedside table, I felt that if I made any sudden moves, he would do something rash. He stood there for a weirdly long amount of time- like he was contemplating something- before saying ""Oh. Oh, ok. Sorry."" completely nonchalantly. He stood by my bed for a few more seconds, and then really slowly left. I was still frozen. I waited until I heard the front door close. Took about 2 or 3 minutes. I was trying to piece together what just happened. Every night, my mom ALWAYS double-locks the door, so I had no idea how this guy got in. I assumed she had just forgotten this one time and, this is the one time that someone actually broke in.

I went into my mom's room, and since she had just moved in, her friend got confused and came into the wrong house (even though he was creepy as shit and didn't respond to an accidental entrance the way a normal person would). So we didn't call the police or anything. Just assumed it was a mistake. I was still really creeped out though.

The next morning, I wasn't expecting anyone. Must've been looking for a different Sarah"". And she brushed it off then she went inside.

What. No. Way too coincidental.

A little later that day, demanding new locks for her house, crying and freaking out. So, it seemed pretty safe for us to assume that she had some kind of stalker (possibly why she moved in the first place) and he had found her new address. My mom decided to call the cops, I gave them a description, but there wasn't really anything they could do.

We have since changed our locks, is pretty damn disturbing.

 I live in a two-story home, is the one that is farthest back.

 So, I was dead asleep in bed. My mom, brother, and his friend were all awake talking downstairs in the living room. You know, just talking about life, giving advice and such. My other brother and dad both were gone, so it was only us. While talking, so they stopped and listened. They didn't hear anything else, and it's very dim. No one could see in.

 While talking they heard more movement, and that's when I saw him. I saw a man with a white mask, pressing his face against my window trying to see in. At the time, I had sheer lacy curtains with red trim, very girly. At that point, I quickly ran out of my room and downstairs.

When we moved in

For a while, abusive douchecanoe. It was easy enough to avoid him since I spent most of my time in my room. As long as the chores were done and he couldn't find a reason to yell, it was fairly peaceful. After a couple of months, he found a reason. He would hound my sister or myself into going out to close the gate because one of us left it open. It took a couple of weeks for us to have a conversation about closing the gates. She thought it was me and I was sure it was her since I rarely went outside. We came to the conclusion that it was him and he was just too lazy to go back out and close them, so he sent us instead. It gave him the chance to be verbally abusive and he enjoyed that.

This continued for a while. The gate that was open was usually on the side and it was almost every day. 

It finally ended one night towards the end of my freshman year. My mom worked third shift but had weekends off. When she worked I spent the night at my aunt's, so it was easy to see inside or outside. My window faced the street, so I didn't think it mattered. As I was laying there, someone started knocking on my window. I immediately feigned sleep. I knew whoever it was could see me because of those damn cats and I was too afraid to make a run for the door. They knocked for several minutes, with the knocks getting louder each time until it finally stopped. I don't know how long I continued to lay there and pretend, but eventually I ran out. I woke my mother up to tell her what happened and she insisted it was just a dream. I slept in my sister's room that night. The next morning, my mom's husband was preparing food and looked out the window to see the gate open. That time, he immediately came back in

The gist of what the police told us was, but the peeper never came back for his ladder. The gates were never left open again, I taped black construction paper over my window and the shower window was covered after that. It took a shamefully long time for me to realize that even though it would have been easier to use the side without the fence, it would have been louder because of the gravel. Now I almost wish I had went outside to kick whoever it was in the balls for the super fun abuse heaped on us for what his laziness.

",38,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/17csa3/the_stalker_in_the_black_hood/,"I should start off by saying that I'm a very smart girl. My parents taught me everything about creepers and stalkers. But that couldn't stop them from coming after me.

My dream is to be a journalist, we all did our best to support him. My piece was very emotional and personal, and I received tons of compliments. A few days after the story was published I was walking home from the library when I noticed a boy (I assumed it was a boy my age) in a black hood staring at me from across the street.

I was pretty creeped out

He jogged up to me and said

""Thank you so much! I'm glad you liked it! He was one of my favourites too.""

We talked for a little while as he walked me to my house (I know, school, etc. When we got to my house he asked me for my number. I thought he was very nice, and also very cute, so I gave it to him (again, bad move).

He called me a few days later and asked if I wanted to see a movie with him and some friends. I wanted to go

A few hours later he showed up on my front porch, and I finally relented. He drove me to the theatre, and I started getting creeped out again because his 'friends' weren't there. It was just the two of us. And things just got weirder from there...

Throughout the whole movie, but the irrational part of my brain told me that there was no way I could walk home (it was January, and around 0 degrees with the wind chill). 
He finally took me home and walked me to my porch, and locked the door. 

He left me alone for a few days, he hugged me from behind. I did the first thing that came to mind, and shoved him off. He gave me another creepy smile, pulled up his damned black hood, and walked away.

For the next few weeks, but not that serious. I did complain to my friends, but they just laughed and joked, saying he was the closest to a boyfriend that I'd ever have (don't get me wrong, they're great friends, they just didn't see the real danger yet).

One day I was walking home, but then I decided the best thing would be to tell him off so he'd leave me alone. I opened my mouth to curse him out but he interrupted me. He started going on and on about how he's loved me for three years, and has been waiting for the moment that he could run his fingers through my hair and kiss my soft lips. He said he wanted me to be his, and that he'd hurt anyone that got in the way of our love. As he said this he grabbed my hand and put it over his heart.

Now I was really freaked out. I said something along the lines of ""If you come anywhere near me I'll beat the fucking shit out of you! Don't think I won't do it you fuckass creep!""

But he just kept smiling

I came home to find a package sitting on my porch, who lives in Switzerland and is always sending me stuff. I brought it up to my room and opened it. 

The first thing I saw was a card with my name written on it. I didn't even notice that it wasn't my uncle's handwriting (I can be so stupid sometimes). I opened it up, and how he would cross oceans and so on in order to be with me. He talked about the first time he saw me, how long he loved me, descriptions of my 'delicious, soft, beautiful hair' and how badly he wanted to run his hands up and down my face.
Then things got more graphic. He said he wanted to strap me onto my bed and 'fuck me until I left scratches down his back and the sheets are soaked'. At that point I stopped reading, I shouldn't have looked at what was in the package, but I've always been too curious for my own good, and now was no exception. 

I tore through a mountain of white tissue paper and found an album book and a weird scarf thingie. I opened the album book, some closer. I was with with friends, with family, running on the track, giving a speech on a podium after receiving a writing award. One was even of me reading a book on my porch. I was bawling my eyes out at this point. Then I turned to the scarf, and slowly unraveled it. What I saw made me choke in horror. 

It was a chunk of my hair, and saw something I hadn't noticed before. A picture of me with my best friend Jamie. But that's impossible, that picture was in a frame on my dresser...

There was no postmark on the package 

I finally broke down and told my mother. We were never really close, and then the police. They confiscated the box and all of the items as evidence. They also questioned me about the stalker. I gave his name and a description of him, and they suggested I get a restraining order. 

My friends and family were very supportive, but whenever he tried to get close, my friends would form a circle around me and tell him to fuck off. Again, I was very grateful. 

I did eventually get a restraining order, thankfully. But to this day I continue to ask myself how he managed to steal a picture off of my dresser, or how he cut off a piece of my hair.

 I was always raised right and I knew how to avoid scary situations (don't go out alone at night, carrying a briefcase. Very normal looking in my opinion, so I didn't think much of it. He made a small comment about the amount of traffic and I politely smiled, but did not answer. Then he asked, ""What's a pretty girl like you doing all by yourself in the city?"" 
This automatically sent off every red flag I've ever learned in elementary school and I replied ""I'm just meeting my friends right up here."" thinking this was the proper thing to say. When the light turned, every instinct inside of me told me not to go in that big empty garage by myself. So I made a turn and went around the block in a circle, knowing this would prove for certain he was following me. And he was. I was welling up with tears, unsure of what to do- so I ran into the public library, the most open space I could think of. I ran in and went into the women's restroom and sat in a stall and waited for a few minutes. 

I called my then-boyfriend (notice the then) and asked him to come up and get me and he said he was too busy and to just wait it out. I called my brother and he said he was on his way, looking around the library. I ran back into the bathroom and sat there for around 15 more minutes. I looked out again, and he was gone. So I went over to a crowded study area and sat at a desk. I couldn't bring myself to do anything else, I was too shaken up. 

I sat there and sat on my phone and constantly watched the clock. I sat for what seemed like an eternity when I heard a small voice behind my ear. ""I have a present for you.."" The hair on the back of my neck shot straight up and every drop of blood in my body froze. I turned around to see the man standing there with a book. It was an art book with paintings of picnics. 
He said ""Would you like to go on a picnic with me? You seem like a girl that would like picnics.."" I turned and said in a loud, come on.""

 At this point, lowers himself eye-to-eye with me, and whispers through gritted teeth ""Obey the law. Protect your face."" And I say ""Excuse me?"" and he runs away before someone comes over to ask if I was okay. To this day, I have no idea what that statement meant, but I quit my job the next day. I still do not go downtown.

1335716524.0,sy9z4,The Dog Killer,HankHillll,144,18,36,"I grew up in a very small town of about 1500 people

My friend and I were 12, talking about what we would do if we happened along a would be killer.  It was innocent 12 year old banter, and we kept on walking, reaching a corner of the tracks we had never before encountered.

The trees near the tracks seemed to be thicker there, a trail started winding its way into the forest.  It was about the width of a car, so we weren't too creeped out or anything, and being the curious 12 year olds we were, it obviously had to be investigated.

Making our way down the embankment, we would run as fast as we could back to my friends house.  (As it was the closer of our houses).  We continued walking down the path for about 20 feet when we came to a clearing.  It wasn't too big, but in the middle of it there was a shack, obviously poorly constructed by someone who did not want any interaction with society.

My friend and I looked at eachother in fear, beyond curious at this point.  (In hindsight, this was obviously a bad move, as this was almost the creepiest place I had ever been in my life and we both could have been murdered in a moment and no one would have heard it).  I was the first to reach the uneven porch, and I stepped up onto it as quietly as I could, my friend just two steps behind me.  We could faintly smell cigarettes and mold coming from inside the building.  Was someone actually living here? We had to find out.

I slowly peeked my head up into view of the window, a dirty mattress on the floor.  Looking around for signs of life and not finding any, I signalled to my friend to follow me inside.  Pushing the creaky door open, a smell hit us that was indescribable.  The best I can descirbe it was like hot garbage mixed with a porta potty and burned wood.

Now that we knew no one was there, wondering aloud who in their right minds would live in a place like this.  Our town was too small to have homeless people, but I guess whoever lived in that dump was the closest one we had.  There were broken egg shells all over the floor, along with coffee grounds, numurous banana peels, and pieces of paper covered with writing.  I picked up what appeared to be a journal and found an entry going back to 1978.  I read it aloud to my friend and we both got chills.  The entry was titled, ""My First Kill"".  We new we had to get the fuck out of there as soon as humanly possible.  Without thinking

The colour left our faces and we turned towards whatever was making the sound.  We could see out of the small, half tripped towards the door and opened it as quietly as we could.  Not knowing which way he was going to come around to the front, we guessed and went around to the left.  It turned out we were correct.  The creepy man turned the corner and hopped onto the deck just as we were hopping off.  Just then he yelled/screamed, ""WHO HAS BEEN IN MY HOUSE?!?!"" All I could picture when he bellowed was the big, bad wolf, and for some reason that scared me more than ever.

My friend and I turned to look behind us and the man was leaping off of the porch towards us! We had no time to think, and he was only about 10 feet behind us when we reached the embankment... We scurried up it as fast as we could, hoping that the stocky man wasn't as fast with climbing as he was at running.  We continued to run down the tracks, our lungs and legs screaming at us to stop.  We only bothered to look behind us when we had to go down another path onto a well used road.  The man was thankfully nowhere to be seen.  Although he wasn't near us, my friend and I continued to jog towards her house, even though it was probably 35C out that day.  Once we got there, we shut and locked the door and collapsed onto her couch.  That's when I remembered the journal.

I opened it and we began reading.  Every single entry was about his love of killing dogs

I haven't thought about that man in a long time

On the way from dropping some clothing off to a Goodwill bin, Oscar, was a pretty cool dude.  He was good natured, funny, even said that the ring on my finger was a throw off even though he knew I wasn't married.  I found his skills of deduction impressive at the time, and he asked for my number.  I told him I'd think about it.

A couple of hours later, Oscar offered me his number and I gave him mine in turn.  As soon as I left the place, he called.  Like, right away.

""I want to see you again.""  And I was like.. uh.. okay.  What time do you get off of work?  He told me the time, I -always- meet people AWAY from my house, I'm somewhat of a recluse and I don't like when people randomly show up, which in this case, is a damn good thing.)

So, the conversation was a really decent one that didn't raise any red flags.

It wasn't until he walked me back to the car, and he immediately asked for a kiss.  What?  I told him no.  Then he asked for a hug.  I thought this was reasonable and gave him one, but it lasted -way- too long, he wouldn't let go.  I had to say 'Okay' at least three times before he let up.  So, I hurried up and got into my car and left.

The weirdness didn't start yet, lets hit up my Uncles bar and go shoot pool.  I gave him a time and a date and the place, and everything was alright.  I didn't think I'd hear from him -right- after, so I took a nap (probably from a headache).

When I woke up a couple of hours later and checked my phone for the time, saying how it broke down and he fixed it, that he really wants to see me and he misses me, and asking why I haven't texted him back and he's getting worried.  Then asked if I was ignoring him and if I even liked him, and what was going on and who I was talking to.  This guy went apeshit in a couple of hours and all I did was just go to sleep!

So I told him in texts that his constant texting was freaking me out and to let up a little.  He said okay and goodnight

Dinner was made and cooked, why won't you answer.  So I ignored him, went to sleep.  Woke up?  More upon more texts, why aren't you answering, do you want to talk to me at all?  I'm going to call in a minute, why won't you pick up the phone?  (I believe he did call, my house has shitty reception

It was just something that I didn't want to see when I woke up in the morning and I was seriously glad I didn't give this creeper my address.  So I told him flat out, but I was honestly creeped out and I promised myself that if something bothered me, I'd be open and honest about it.  He asked why, and said that he'd stop, and it felt like I was already in a damn relationship with the dude already?  So I told him that we just don't need to see each other and lets move on.  He didn't answer back.

I thought everything was fine until the span of the week I kept getting random texts of.. why won't you talk to me, etc.  Then I got the 'If you don't answer me by Thursday I know we won't be meeting Friday.'  Which was weird as shit, because I told him I didn't want to see him at all cause he was a creeper.

So I just ignored the texts, so we got 30 minute breaks to stretch legs and just fuck around), I immediately turned the phone on, called Sprint and requested an immediate number change.  The amount of people I had to call and the paperwork that I had to put in afterwards was completely worth it, fuck that guy.

In the summer time we get a lot of cottagers and people from the city. We like to call them cidiots because some of them can be really douchey

Well one night we were at the local bar and having a good time. I went there with a girlfriend of mine and her 2 friends whom I have never met. But they were really nice but not my type.

I see a Cadillac Escalade all black with chrome rims and a white Mercedes pull in to the parking lot. I was kind of intrigued so I made sure to take note on who walked in the door. I suddenly feel a touch on my shoulder and it's a young Arabic/pakistani/indian man asking me to dance, I like metal look. 

I found him to be very weird as he was sitting at the bar staring at me. He takes out his cell phone, was pretty cute! 

I continued dancing with my friends on the dance floor but couldn't get passed that creepy feeling I was being glared at. My friend tells me that those men are staring at me and pointing and it's kind of freaky. I decide to get off the dance floor and go sit down with my friends and have some drinks. The older man came over to my table and tapped me on the should and asked me to come over so he can talk to me. I walked over and he said I want to introduce you to my son. He waved his son over and we shook hands and said hello. I asked him if there was any reason why he wanted me to meet his son and he said I am a very beautiful girl with nice hair and clothes and that he wants me to date his son. I kindly said no thank you I am currently seeing someone at the moment. He kind of looked at me with a weird look of disappointment mixed with rage. He then put his arm around me and pulled out a wad of cash and said come on let us buy you a drink and talk to us more

I looked over at my friends and they were waving me over and were like WTF. I said one minute and talked to this man a little more (stupid me I know

They took a couple more pictures of me before leaving the bar. I thought that was really weird, but it was too weird for me. 

Last call hits and we decide to grab our jackets at the coat check because it could be a very big line. We grab out jackets and wait outside for our taxis to come. Stupid people were jumping and pushing for cabs in front of the bar so we decided to walk down to the other street and call one from there.

No doubt I showed my sister the note. She didn't really care and thought it wasn't real. A week goes by. The doorbell rings. I answer it and I see Andrew in our front yard running back to his car parked in the street

I think I was around 12 when this happened and I was on holiday with my family. My brother (2 years younger than me) and I decided to go swimming in this awesome indoor pool, I noticed a man standing around in a area where the cubicles were all empty which was strange because at first I thought he was waiting for someone, I can't remember too well what he looked like just that he was quite skinny and normal height. I proceeded into a cubicle and I noticed how he looked at me as I walked past, this didn't bother me at the time but anyway, I put my clothes down and locked the door, before I got changed I was putting my hair into a ponytail and looked down to see a head pop underneath the wall of the cubicle he must of been really stupid because it was super obvious and as a young girl I panicked, I didn't say a word and froze for a few seconds at him trying to adjust himself to see me properly, but I grabbed my stuff and booked it outta there, well

There was a guy, skinny, an odd way of carrying himself, and a clearly nervous, shaky voice when he spoke. He came behind me and said, without introducing himself, ""Those guys are talking about you."" I turned and didn't see any particular group paying attention to me, but didn't want to talk to him further. Something about the way he was staring at me unnerved me

The next day, came and sat next to me without introducing himself. He sat, and did not talk, but listened to our conversation and we tried to include him as much as possible, both of us assuming that the other knew him. He got up and left, and we each asked the other what his name was and neither of us knowing. Once again, I shrugged this off as a nervous encounter during the first week of school.

After that, on my way to classes, but he never seemed to be there on purpose nor did he ever talk to me. However, some of my friends started to tell me that he often asked where I was if he saw them without me, even if they had never introduced themselves to him before. Naturally, I started to become a bit wary of his presence and hyper-aware of him.

A month or so passed (with this behavior continuing), and I got this feeling from him so I naturally began to distance myself from him. Eventually, it got to the point where I walked off the dance floor in order to grab a snack. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I turned around to see him standing behind me, his body shaking and his face sweaty. 

""Can you talk to me outside?"" His voice shook and his grip tightened on my shoulder. 

Terrified, about what?""

His voice sputtered it out

I backed away and said ""No"" a dozen times, later going to talk to my friends, asking why I ""hate him"" and ""never want to talk to him,"" despite this being one of the first attempts of him ever speaking to me.


The story has gotten worse over the past two years, writing me an anonymous (disturbing) love-poem online, multiple lengthy passive aggressive messages on facebook that have never received replies (and an eventual ""block""), multiple occasions where he would try to position himself in class so he can watch me, and him trying to ""befriend"" my friends and constantly ask them about me/about my whereabouts.

The conversation turns more and more inappropriate, and this guy (we'll call him Marine Officer Badass... MOB for short) tried to ""apprehend"" him, only to be told to ""go get fucked, cunt!"". MOB returns and appears to call the local police and file a report (throwing in bullshit claims of the guy doing burn outs and doughies, all of which never happened, the guy just peacefully drove away).

Then, on his little push bike, meanwhile the girl chats with us and makes it clear she's creeped out by the guy.

Ended up posting this video to facebook, causing a young girl to be burnt severely.

I remember it was winter; winter nights always seem the darkest in Wisconsin. My boyfriend and I had just finished a day full of winter festivities, things of that genre. Since we had driven all over downtown Milwaukee for the majority of the day, it came as no surprise that my car was in need of some gas, and fast. Not quite knowing the east side of Milwaukee that well, I trusted my boyfriend when he told me that the BP gas station on the corner of North and Farwell was a “nice” one. As we pulled into the gas station I realized he was right, the gas station looked brand new and the neighborhood seemed rather nice as well. As I was filling my car, my boyfriend and I began to joke about the encounters we had throughout the day, we here this loud pitched scream. Startled we looked in the direction of the noise and saw a man running like a “bat out of hell” toward us. The closer he got the more I could make out that his screams were actually shouts for help. “HELLLLLLLLP! HELLLLP MEEEE!” He shouted so loudly that even the echo of his words sounded just as loud as his previous shout. 



He continued running just as fast, he looked directly at me and shouted, “THEY ARE AFTER ME! YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!” I remember him being an average looking guy. He was skinny, had blonde hair, and looked like he was in his mid 20s, but the thing that really got me were his eyes. They were wild, yet somewhat glazed over, my boyfriend and I entered the gas station and found the crazed man hiding behind the isle that had the chips and the Slim Jims. 



“Are you okay?” I asked him. 


“NO!” He replied


“Who? Who is after you?” I asked


“Uhhh…” he hesitated this time. “Four guys. I was just robbed outside my house. They are probably still waiting there for me. Help.” He was no longer yelling


“Did you call the cops?” I asked the man. I quickly glanced at the cashier; he disapprovingly shook his head at me


“No


“No way man. You need to call the cops.” He said



As we left the gas station I asked him why he decided to speak up. He told me that the Twisted Fork was right down the block and that it would take the man literally less than a minute to run to it. He was convinced the man was out to murder us. I laughed and brushed it off as him being a chicken. As we got into the car, his smile never wavering. I hightailed it out of there as fast as I could. To this day I have still not told my boyfriend what I saw; I hate admitting he is right. I am not sure what that man would have done if I would have let him in my car, but I sure it would have involved some type of pain.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/piu0c/my_milwaukee_gas_station_encounter/

For a preface


There was a period of time that I would head to Capital Community College in Hartford


I usually didn't go home 'til around 9 or 10. It was pretty dark by then. The CT transit buses would line up in front of the Old State House


There are 3 different bus stops around my house that I can take to head Downtown. At the time I only knew of one, and continues up Vine.


I had to walk up Love Lane a bit before I reached the residential area that was somewhat close-by.


At the time, and myself, were driving down Vine with no issue. There was a certain fellow on the bus, who looked a bit disheveled and all, but I didn't pay him any mind. I mean, it's Hartford, for god's sake. Nonetheless


My stop came, he took the back exit, I took the front.


I minded my business,"" and went on my way... I walked up the slowly inclining hill, and hear the bus beginning to slowly pull off. The man was behind me, and was going in the same direction I was.


I have short legs, I couldn't shake this fucking feeling off...


Anyone who's taking the buses in Hartford knows the routes, not sure if it was at me, or the bus.


""I'll take you where you need to go, giving a simple thank you.


The guy is now waving and shouting at the bus


He goes up Love Lane and turns onto my street


I guess the only thing I have to say is don't be a girl and walk in a wooded area


TL;DR version: Creepy fellow might have possibly got to me if it weren't for the valiant efforts of a bus driver going off the route for me. The end.

It was spring break, and the power had started flickering on and off, so I decided it would be best if I just went to bed since I couldn't watch TV or go online. My mom also decided to go to bed as well, but she is an insomniac, and while trying to fall asleep she heard noises coming from our backyard. 


She looked through the blinds, but it was so dark. I decided to flick on the lights to our backyard, as I flipped the switched on and off I realized the power was totally gone, and that meant our alarm system was also disabled.


I pressed my ear against the glass while still hiding behind the blinds with my mom. I heard a clinking sound that you would hear if you rattled an empty aluminum can and the coke tab had fallen in. I thought I heard voices


""There is probably no one outside, I immediately jumped out of bed and ran towards the window that overlooks our backyard. I ran so fast that I slipped onto the tiled floor as I came up onto the window. I pushed the blinds away, only to see a faint crack on the window that was spreading quickly through the glass. I realized immediately that the glass was cracking and it was probably going to shatter. 


At this point my mom was at the window with two hurricane flashlights. We shined them through the cracked, but no one was out there. 


After the storm subsided we called the cops. We all went out to the patio door to inspect it and sure enough the lock had been tampered with and the cops said it looked like there were several people out there by the look of the grass and bushes (the bushes looked like they were trampled on.)

It was, which was quite strange. Non-students tend to keep different hours than those who have classes and office hours to attend, and it was because of that, I believe, I ran into trouble.

It was maybe 8 or 9 pm in mid-May when my studies were interrupted by loud banging on my door. I didn't have a chain on my door (something that I've since insisted upon in every subsequent building in which I have resided), ""Yes? What do you need?"" through it. 

From the other side

I turned the music off and apologized; it wasn't even that loud

But turning the music off didn't make him go away. He kept yelling

He stayed out there for another 2-3 minutes maybe; I didn't check the time, I wondered?

From that point out, I came home from an incredibly difficult Statistics test to find police swarming my building. There was crime scene tape on the 4th floor -- the floor on which I lived. 

Since I never looked out, starting at 9pm? who does that?), it could have been me.

Fast forward to my senior year. Still riding the city bus daily. On a normal day, a right onto a half street, and across the main road. Until that point, however, it's pretty deserted. 

It was early spring. The sun was shining but it was crisp outside, I was very shy. I didn't want to overtake him and have to acknowledge him in any way. I bend down, re-tie my shoe, and dilly-dally a bit. When I stand up, I notice he has turned around and stopped, looking at me. I begin walking and keep my head down. Soon, I'm near him and he starts chatting me up. I'm getting a bad vibe and I feel extremely uncomfortable. The conversation was as follows:

""Hey

""No. You have the wrong person

""Yeah

""Sorry

He asks me for my number, we're walking past a field that has tall grass growing most of the year. I'm tense and trying to be polite but firm, and failing miserably. 

""Want to smoke with me?"" He asks. 

""No thanks. I don't do any of that.""

""You a virgin?"" He asks. This details me completely. I stutter for a moment before saying yes. While this is the truth, baby. We can smoke and fuck.""

At this point, but now my replies are simply ""No."" I cross the street and sit down at the bus stop bench and he walks into an apartment complex behind me. After a few minutes, the bus pulls up. Right before I get on, he comes out of the complex and asks me the time. I tell him, get on the bus, and hope that he doesn't follow me.

1344360871.0,xtzlu,Listen to your instincts. ,challengereality,152,26,16,"When I first subbed to Let’sNotMeet

My first year of high school, I usually stayed after school for rehearsal. My routine didn’t vary much: when the last bell of the day rang, I’d go to my locker, get my books, and wait for the kids taking the bus to clear out so I could use the bathroom in relative peace. 

The hall monitor assigned to this hall was the new female field hockey coach, once the buses had departed, Coach Bren would come into the girls’ bathroom and check around. I’d usually pass her on my way in or out of the restroom, or I’d hear her come in while I was in a stall. It struck me as odd- why would she need to patrol the bathroom after the school day had ended? As far as I knew, none of the other bathrooms in the school were checked at this time. I chalked it up to an overachieving faculty member taking her duty as “enforcer of the peace” very seriously. Although I saw Coach Bren almost every day, she never gave anything other than a nod of acknowledgement. She rarely made eye contact. It was a little weird, her just walking into the bathroom, so I berated myself for even giving her behavior a second thought. Regardless

Fast forward a year. My friend calls me up to tell me that Coach Bren had been charged with sexually abusing a 15 year-old female student at a school she’d previously worked at. The abuse had gone on for several months

I always wonder if her reasons for checking the bathroom after school were more sinister than even I had originally suspected.

I'm in high school at the time, everyone's asleep and I'm in my room on the top floor.  I should have been asleep an hour ago and my eyes need a break from my computer screen.  I stare out the window but don't see much more than my reflection.  I turn back to my computer but something catches my eye.  I press my face to the glass to get a good look and I see it.  

In my driveway is a strange car.  In the strange car is a strange man.  His interior lights are on and I can sort of make out his face.  He has sandy hair, confused more than scared.  I think maybe he's lost and pulled in to get off the street.  Maybe he was reaching over to his glove to get a map.  I turn out my lights so I can better spy on this weirdo and every few seconds I press my face against the glass to see if he's still there, which he is.  In the same position.  Fidgeting.  

My eyes finally adjusted to the low light and it dawns on me what he's doing.  I reel away from the window.  I realize he isn't looking for a map

I can't really see below his waist thanks to his steering wheel but it's still really weird.  I have no idea if it's something I should wake someone up for or call 911 about or what I'd say if I did either.  I put on a shirt and go downstairs.  Thankfully my mom is already up and at the front door, passing me the phone she was clutching.  I guess she was thinking about calling the police but instead she bursts through the front door striding right towards his car and screaming.  He sees her in a second and speeds off before she's even close.  His interior light still on and still buck naked.  

Nothing really comes of it.  I go back to my room and she calls the cops and describes the car and the man.  They say they'll be on the lookout but there's nothing to really do about it.  It's pretty uncomfortable and we have a bit of a weird laugh about whether he drove home completely naked or stopped to put on pants.  In the end it was pretty strange but harmless.  I barely ever remember it but when I do I cringe at how naive I was.

[**Here is a handy map!**](http://i.imgur.com/FQ7exBa.jpg)

At the time, my mom, and my dog Pepper - a flatcoated retriever of about 19 years of age. Ol' Pepper was getting hard of hearing, and mother's Day was coming up, so I got my mom a German Shepherd pup for the occasion.

About a month later, and left a note for my mom, and left, saying he'd come back in a few days to get his stuff. The next day (Day 1), as he was leaving, the GS pup ran out in front of his truck and was hit. He suffered a broke puppy nose, and was put on antibiotics and had to sleep in the laundry room while he healed (our dogs were outside dogs).

The next day (Day 2) I was coming hom from school/work, and about a mile from the main road, there was our house sitting back about 150-200 yards from the road. About 75 yard from our drive way was another road that came out at the road in front of our house, and was at a slight angle. So, as I came home, I noticed there was an older white truck just parked there, no lights on, he flashed his lights. I thought *”WTF...*”

I explained the situation to my mom, I start flashing my high/low beams as I get closer to my house...and then I notice the white truck is back and I nearly shit a brick. There he is, sitting in the truck again. I get home and tell my mom, and now she’s concerned. She calls up the Chester Co Sheriff’s and asks for someone to come check it out. It takes them no less than 30 minutes to respond, and the officer can’t even figure out where our house is. He calls and says “I think I am in front of your house, do you see me?” and my mom says “Yes! I see you! Waving a flashlight, right?” And he says “No ma’am...I’m not doing that...” Holy. Shit. My mom and I immediately run from the front porch and back inside

About 15 minutes later, even if there is someone parked up there on the road, there’s really nothing we can do about it unless a crime is being committed. But do call us again if anyone is on your property.” Uh huh. Thanks.

Day 4: My mom has now gone to Lowe’s and bought those cheap little magnetized alarms that you can stick to windows/doors, my Aunt slept in my room while I slept with my mom in her bed. I didn’t have to work that day, so I came home right after school and we didn’t notice the white truck parked at the road, because eventually it gets dark...

We sit in the front room, who insists on sitting *right* in my lap despite how he has been growing like a weed. Then, my pup just gets still. His ears perk up. He looks *right in the direction* of where the truck normally parks, and lets out a blood-freezing, low growl more intimidating that I had ever heard from an adult dog. I mean, it’s *scary*. He just keeps staring right out the window and growling in the direction of where the truck would be.

My mom and aunt look at each other, and my old dog is on the porch snoozing away because she couldn’t hear an atomic blast in her age. The curtains are drawn, and I am in my mom’s room. The floodlight *behind* the house is now on (mom’s room is on that side of the house, I see it from her window). My mom and aunt are basically now walking around the house making sure shit is locked. My mom and comes into the room and sits on the bed with me and the pup, who is still growling sporadically and whining.

My aunt is in the hall between mom’s bedroom and the living room, but again, they take forever to get there and they see nothing.

On Day 5, nothing really happens. I come home from school/work, there’s no truck, flood lights don’t go off, alarms are silent, dogs are calm. Day 6 goes off without a hitch as well. My mom and I figure the guy got the message with the alarms, lights, and the cops coming out a second time (we assumed he was aware somehow). 

So Day 7 rolls around. We’re starting to get back to normal. We think maybe there was just a deer in the yard setting off the lights, or maybe it was some guy and a lady needing a secluded place to screw around. No biggie, right?

This night, no one is in it. I race home, pushing my shitty little Geo Metro down that long gravel drive way as fast as I can safely drive. I run in the house. “Mom. He’s back. And he ain’t in the cab!.” My mom says “Go to your room, and get enough clothes for tonight, and meet me in the den as soon as possible.” Our den was the room next to the carport. I meet her there in like 2 minutes flat. In the meantime, she has locked all the doors/windows, drawn all curtains/blinds, and both were spending most of their time on/near the front porch.

“Listen, run out and get in. Pull the door shut behind you, but just get in.” I express worry about the dogs, but she says they are dogs and will be ok. She takes my bag, gets in the car, and starts it. I run out, pulling the locked door shut behind me

We get to the end of the driveway where we have to turn left to get onto the road. The driveway is lined with big oak trees and pecan trees, turns left without even stopping for safety, and high tails it to the highway. About a mile from home she says “Um...did you...notice anything?” and I say “YES! You saw him too?!” She says she did, but didn’t want to scare me.

That night we slept in a motel about 45 minutes from home. My mom called the sheriffs, and left behind a lot of stuff that we just couldn’t get.

For New Years last year my mom, so I just had a party of my own with a few of my friends. My friends however were shitty house guests and pretty much trashed my house. I had to practically babysit them all night, then take them all home about 5 am. When I got back from taking them home I had to clean my entire house before my mom got back. After the house was clean I passed out, but was awoken a couple hours later to my mother who seemed pretty upset. I thought to myself ""Shit, she knows!"". But instead of freaking out over the house she was freaking out over some texts she had recieved.

The texts were really creepy; They were going on and on saying things like ""beware the evil that lives next door"" and stuff about a little girl and the devil. The texts weren't how a normal person would text either. Probably the creepiest part was that the text was worded as if someone centuries ago had sent it

I asked how she knew it was him, she told me that he had made up a fake address that was along the lines of ""123 Stethescope Lane.""

1348281873.0,10a5if,We had a near miss in Rome,,150,28,23,"I spent the last school year studying in Europe, and the other girl I was in was from even worse. The hostel was an apartment in a building with a little garden area out front and a gate separating it from the street. 

We spent a few days touring around the sights, a small group of us broke off and decided to go with a couple of people who helped run the pub crawl but weren’t working that night. 

I honestly have no idea where we went. We went from bar to bar

So, chatting and what not and eventually we decided it was time to call it a night. The local guy left first since he lived nearby, and we walked back with the Australian guy who told us a super cute story of how he’s in love with a girl back home. We eventually got to the point where we split off from him. He offered to walk us the rest of the way, but we politely declined thinking that we were fine since there was two of us. Wrong. So very, very wrong. 

We parted in high spirits. It was about 4 in the morning. We were still buzzed from drinking all night and we were discussing all the crazy things that had happened. So, he had his hood pulled over and he was sprinting straight for us at full speed. 

Just at that moment, but I can’t remember even what language he was speaking; I was so scared he could have been speaking English and that wouldn’t have computed. I just kept backing away and repeating “NO! NO!”, praying that the gate would hold.

For those of you who don't know

We were walking down Commercial street, I stayed extra close to my parents.  We went into a military-themed surplus and junk store.  I wandered off, figuring I was relatively safe among the piles of cool stuff (plus, they had a full suit of medieval plate mail for sale that I had to stare at).  I was eyeing some old army helmets, when I looked up and saw Chin-pubes down the aisle.  When we made eye contact, he quickly turned to look at something on a shelf.  Every few seconds he would glance back to see if I was still watching him.  I felt pretty damn uncomfortable.

I ducked into a nearby aisle while he was pretending to look at something and booked it to the register in front (near a witness), you'll have to forgive me for glossing over what happened, but at every store, Chin-pubes was there.

After some more store-hopping, so we all piled into the car and took off.  I looked out the rear window, and there was no Chin-pubes in sight.  Suffice it to say, I was pretty damn happy that he was gone.

We arrived at the restaurant, so I was really savoring every bite), when I had to pee.  I got up, found the men's room, and got into a stall (I was a really shy and timid kid). Just as I was about to unzip my pants, someone else walked into the men's room.  Like any incredibly shy person, I paused in order to wait for him to leave.

He walked to the urinals, and repeated at the next stall.  At that point, I was frozen with fear.  He got up, stepped outside my stall, then got down on his hands and knees, and poked his face under the door of my stall.  It was Chin-pubes.  What can only be described as a pedo-smile spread across his face, and he reached for me.

I screamed bloody murder and punted his face as hard as my chubby 12-year-old legs could kick just as he grabbed my left leg.  He let go of my leg, and there was blood in a trail from the stall to the door.  I timidly left the bathroom, looking around nervously, and got back to my parents' table, where I told them about Chin-pubes.

**Background: The Gem and Mineral Show** *You may skip this paragraph.*

Every year (around February) Tucson hosts The Gem and Mineral Show. Apparently, thick quartz crystals as big as your arm, towering stalagmite sculptures cut in half to display twinkling mounds of amethyst inside, fat golden drops of amber nesting prehistoric insects in their glowing depths… Even if you weren’t a geologist’s kid (like I am), you’d be swept away with all the wondrous items being sold at stalls. Dust and silt from giant limestone slabs peppered with fish from ages long past settle over everything in a grimy haze. The only true language spoken amongst the vendors is that of commerce and the occasional cough from the silt. Wads of cash exchange hands at a dizzying rate and rare collectibles disappear in a swath of wrapping paper and plastic bags. Because it is such a lucrative business, it tends to attract those looking to make a quick buck at someone else’s expense. It is not uncommon for the vendors to import their own guards to ensure the safety of their valuables. The less-than affluent dealers learn that Tucson is native to various scumbags, most of which are very skilled in exchanging stolen goods for something that’s easier to consume in a less than legal manner.


The Wild Oats is located on Speedway, but everyone else pretty much chooses to don western attire. You can guess at where they’re from by eavesdropping on conversations, or what kind of accent they have when they try their English out.  Honestly, it is my favorite time of year, and I don’t even mind that it’s busy.


I was working the late juice bar shift (again) and scrambling to get everyone their correct orders. My espresso bean supply was dwindling from all the double-shots being ordered, there was a man in a tailored grey suit with a partially opened black shirt, salt-and-pepper hair, and a chiseled, well-defined jaw line. His skin was swarthy, and he had a neatly trimmed goatee.  This was before the latest series of Batman movies came out, but I swear to god the casting director had this guy in mind when he was looking for someone to play Ra’s al Ghul. Being a very striking gentleman in his late 40s to early 50s


My glance must’ve caught his attention, tight black shirts, and slacks lumber out from behind in line and escort him to my juice bar. The one that was on my left actually pulled the chair out for Ra’s al Ghul and scooted him in. The guy on the right had his massive arms crossed and stood just a bit behind his boss. I mentioned it before, *but both men were wearing their sunglasses indoors after the sun had already set outside*. Who does that anymore?


Mr. al Ghul was very charming with his thicker Russian accent, he sighed and responded with something along the lines of “Surprise me.” Naturally, I interpreted that as “Don’t serve me swill, or Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum will break you“. 


As an aside, to be precise, but I have no idea where that’s located. All I know is that she has tea protocol and preparation down to a science, and imparted a good deal of that onto me. Don’t scorch the tea or plunk lemon wedges in it, and may heaven help you should you dare sweeten it with honey. If it is black tea, make sure to warm the cream before adding it, or you’ll make it lukewarm. When removing teabags, then discard immediately. Etcetera


Luckily, so they let me keep the rest of the tea bags behind the counter. I warmed some cream up with the steamer while his tea was steeping, extracted the tea bag, added some rock sugar crystals, and gently poured the milk in, holding back foam with the spoon. Stirring gently, I placed a napkin in front of Ra’s and positioned the cup on his right. I noted that during the entire preparation process


Looking directly at my face, chatted, and escorted her over to stand behind Ra’s al Ghul.  During their exchange, he’s telling me that this is the best cup of tea he’s had and I can definitely hear excitement in his voice. He then tells me that they’re looking for a girl to watch the booth at the show here, and at another one someplace in Russia. It is at this point that my ears perk up, because I’m always on the lookout for more money and a chance to travel. Of course, I expressed my interest and he hands me a business card.


It was on a very heavy, it gave an address in Singapore, and on the Russian side I think it said something else. Unfortunately, I don’t know enough about the Cyrillic alphabet to even type it out. Needless to say, it was very impressive, expensive, and not something you can order from Kinko’s. It was a work of art.


After handing it to me, and remarked on what pretty red hair I had. As I said before, my hair’s naturally auburn, but a lot of people mistake it for being red. He then motions for the woman to approach, and starts speaking with her. I can tell it is German, even if I don’t quite grasp what they’re saying. Excited because I had just enrolled in my first semester of German, I waited for a natural pause in their conversation to offer her a polite *Wie geht es dir?* and smiled.


This apparently shocked both of them. Before she can respond, do I have a boyfriend. A little taken back, I answer a little German, some Spanish, and Japanese. Maybe 5’9”, and no, not yet.


“No Mandarin?”


“Ah


He grinned at me, but she did not look offended at all. The way both of them were smiling was a little unsettling. This guy had complimented me in front of his wife, and had offered me a position based on my ability to make a good cup of tea, and my hair. 


Shrugging it off, he once again thanked me for the tea and I responded in turn. With bodyguards on either side and his wife trailing five or so feet behind, he left the store looking like a Russian mob boss.


Now, I’m not so sure. I definitely got weird vibes off him, but he might only have wanted a tea wench. Thoughts?

1354920499.0,14gwca,My subway stalker (the sandwich shop not public transportation),Krillzbee,146,24,12,"When I was 16 I got part time job at a Subway.  There's some details I should write now. 1.) The store was in a plaza and the entire front of the store was windows. 2.) I had a set schedule every week because my extra curriculars. 3.)Little Caesars is on one side of the store and a laundromat is on the other side  Anyways..  We often had people come in and just get drinks and cookies (as opposed to an entire meal) because we were right next door to a laundromat.  I pretty much assumed they just wanted to mosey around, I loved most of my regulars! Cederick had been coming in for a couple of weeks but after awhile he stopped purchasing things from the store.  He also started standing at the end of the counter (near the bread if you are familiar with any Subway set-up)  and would talk and talk.  He started to really get on my nerves. He would talk while I was helping customers and his conversations started getting really aggressive, Deb
A few weeks later though, Cederick noticed.  He came in when I was normally there and demanded to look at the schedule to see when I was working.  Deb was fucking pissed. (she was pretty protective over me for some reason.. loved her for it too!!!) Deb was so angry that she had a meeting with my manager and myself so we could talk about him.  We came to an agreement that if he came in and didn't buy anything that we could call the police.  Welp, Deb told this to Cederick a few days later when he came in to see me (while I was hiding in the back of course!)  Broke and crafty Cederick found a loophole... and started begging people outside of Subway to buy him food!!  When someone agreed to purchase him a sandwich, it was his ticket in.  When people wouldn't buy him food, he just stood outside and looked in at me.  This didn't happen for too long because we told our manager about the begging and she was extremely mad that he was not only harassing a little innocent krillzbee but our customers as well.  We called the cops and they told us to let him know he's no longer allowed in there, it is considered trespassing now, and to call them to come sort things out if need be.  Well ""if need be"" happened when Ced became irate when we kicked him out.  He RAN when I called the police and said they should come down because there's a bit of a situation.  Mr. Cop showed up talked to us took a report and left.  That did the trick and Cederick was gone forever after that. 
JUST KIDDING. Shortly after the cop-calling event I away for college for about four months.  I came back in December to work for a couple of weeks though.  On my second or third day back I went outside for a smoke break.  As I step out back near the dumpsters I look over and there's Cederick.. all dressed up in his Little Caesars uniform with the creepiest 'ima rape you!' look on his face. While I was away he took it upon himself to get a job next door!! I ran inside and told my co-worker (not Deb) who thought I was over-reacting.  When I got home I told my mom that the stalker was back and she told me that I really needed to talk to the Little Caesars manager.  I talked to him and he was completely understanding of the situation.. he also informed me that Cederick had said some really inappropriate things after he saw me outside that one day. (he wouldn't give details.. sorry) Cederick was fired within the week.  I saw him one last time creepily outside of the window but this time he was scowling and angry.  I have since quit that part time job and moved away so I hope I never have to encounter that weirdo again.

We're like ""Sure man, we were just thinkin we need to call a cab."" In complete odd stroke of coincidence, a cab then comes around the corner, and stops for us. Which was weird, because no one had called for one. The cab picks up another couple and we're off to the races. The couple gets dropped off first, then our house is the next closest stop. Eric (the bro) gets out of the cab at our stop with us. He tells the driver that his house is just a couple blocks away and that he'll walk. We pay the driver and I wander inside. 

I take a leak, and when he turned around, Eric had made himself at home. Now keep in mind, although I'm calling him Eric now, I didn't even know this dude's name. I wrote it off and figured ""Well, it's just another party dude that partied a little too hard. We'll just let him sleep then kick him out in the morning."" So we let him pass out.

I told him that I thought he was full of shit, but I was getting him up at seven AM and he wasn't welcome back. Once I gave the ok to stay, he took off his shirt and was passed out again in the bean bag within minutes. 

I drug his ass out of bed around 7:30AM (I slept like complete shit with some strange weirdo in our house AGAIN) and took him to the bank. I told him ""good luck"" and drove off as he walked into the bank. 

Here's the kicker. My roommate called me this afternoon and said he had Googled this guy's full name. I didn't know it until he told me.

I noticed a man dressed in a suit, which I thought was weird, because I thought maybe he could afford his own modes of transportation. As a paranoid child, I already felt a bit of uneasiness.

I could see my grandma clearly. I can't remember what exactly I was thinking, I did not want to be alone. Now, as an adult, I've come to realize how intuitive I am, and how intuitive I have always been. 

About ten minutes of standing in the heat, but I did not like how close this person was. I was trying to see as much as I could out of my peripheral, but all I caught was that the person behind me was a man dressed in a suit...like the suit from the man on the bus, the kind you'd wear to a nice party. 

I took a step to my right...he followed behind me. I took a step forward...he got closer. I took a step to the left...and to no surprise, I saw the man's hand rise up. He grabbed my shoulder, tugged me back, and that's all I needed to drop the lemonades. I ran inside the store, where I have been watching my grandma.

PREFACE: I'm a 25 year old female, at a gas station in southern California. I had worked for this company for a few years, and had never had any real problems because the corporation that owned the chain was very good about enforcing safety precautions. In the last few months before this incident happened, however, the chain was bought out by another company, and all of the things that were set in place to protect our safety, were disabled and thrown out to save money.
* security monitoring company was terminated.
* we were normally supposed to keep the magnetic door locks engaged at all times (from 10pm to 5am)
* we were previously not allowed to go outside on the graveyard shift, work *alone*, and I happened to be the full time graveyard worker.



It started out as another typical night. I arrived at work for my shift at around 10pm. On graveyard, every night at 2am, I would engage the mag locks and not let anybody in for about 1 hour, so I could sweep/mop and stock the coolers, even though I was technically not supposed to lock the doors. 


So it was about 2:30am, which is why I always locked the doors while I was stocking).


Suddenly, but what can I say, some people still just don't seem to get it. So I walk out, and there's this huge black transient man, obviously with a screw loose, screaming at me through the doors. I don't have time to sit there and talk with him, so I just say ""come back at 3:30,"" and I go about my business. 


Fast forward an hour, and head out to the dumpster which is across the lot. **I should mention, there is nothing/nobody around.** All the surrounding businesses close at 9pm and don't open until long after my shift has ended.

Anyways, just walked around the corner of the building next door, and he's waking straight towards me. He's also dragging a wooden baseball bat. I start panicking, trying to think what to do. I drop the trash bags, but I know I can't make it to the doors and lock them before he gets to me. 

He gets halfway to me across the lot, Ricky, a guy who works the night shift at an Albertson's a couple blocks away, pulls into the lot. The guy looks back at Ricky, and turns to head for the doors instead of directly at me. He leans his bat against the wall outside the doors, and goes inside. Ricky pulls right in front of the doors and sees the bat. We make eye contact, and he knows something is wrong.


He walks inside the store with me, while we wait for this guy to leave. The man walks up with a huge slushy that he tries to buy with food stamps. I inform him that he can't buy fountain drinks with EBT, so he grabs it off the counter, and dumps it on the floor. 


Now I'm pissed. Nobody fucks up my nice clean floors. *Nobody*. I go off on him, and then Ricky goes off and says ""hey buddy, you don't talk to a lady like that!"" to which this man responds by getting in Ricky's face (Ricky is maybe 5'10"" tops, this guy is easily 6'4""and huge).


I engage the mag locks, but you can't get in. he's backing up to the doors, opens it, but is still standing there yelling with his foot in the door. He starts reaching for his bat, but can't reach it with his foot in the door. Finally, he slips his foot out for a split second, the mag locks engage, screaming and banging on the doors


The cops (6 of them!) finally arrive after a few minutes, assault, and several sexual assaults of minors.


Ricky was my guardian angel that night. I don't know what would've happened if he hadn't have pulled in right when he did. Thank you Ricky, but you also saved my daughter's life. I was 2 months pregnant.


I quit my job that same day. The company has done nothing to improve/change safety precautions. The transient man still frequents the store.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/r8uik/gas_station_encounter/

This started last night while I was asleep and my mom and 2 sisters Sarah and Geena told me this morning. Last night there was loud crashes on the porch and a loud banging on the door around 10pm. It woke up mom and dad. Geena
A lady banged on the door harder and screamed for us to let her in. That helicopters were chasing her
She said her name was Heather Johnson and asked if she could come inside. That her son was freezing. Mom said the boy could come inside but not her, she said it was Heather Lilley. She asked repeatedly what county this was. Then insisted she needed to go to the bathroom. We agreed to let her use ours if the cop would escort her. She stayed in the bathroom for so long that twice the cop asked if she was okay. She came out with one of ours towels with her... bloody underwear in it. She threw in the trash. She was on her period and told us she owed us a new towel. After that we gave the boy an old winnie the pooh blanket, the cops escorted the 2 of them to God knows where......
 Now today was a half day at school. We come home at 10:30. Me and Sarah came home while Geena went to a friends house. On the way home we saw a red car down the dirt road. I jokingly said it might be the crazy ladys. Not even 5 minutes home there was a knocking on the door. Thinking it was dad coming home from grocery shopping Sarah opened the door. The lady was there with the red car in our driveway. She said the her son had had $200 in his shoe last night and thought it was somewhere around our house. Sarah
 Sarah saw 2 figures across the street in our abandoned neighbors property and said they weren't supposed to be there. She said they were with her. One was her son. The other was an incredibly thin young lady with long dark hair and a gaunt unhappy face. I told her I was going to call my mom and she went down the walkway back to her car,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_pcmqc

I started doing a lot of outdoor stuff when I got my car. My friends and I liked to go fishing and hiking.

One day I wanted to go fishing but everyone was busy

I walked onto the pier and began fishing. People came and went

""well shit

I started packing my stuff and this guy says

""oh hey

I wasn't even thinking
""oh sure its *******""   oh shit.... What the fuck did I just do? I thought to myself. At that moment I already knew nothing good would come from this. Sure enough he called it to make sure I wasn't lying. The creepy bastard. I left without saying anything. Guess what? He followed me back to the parking lot saying he needed to go too.

Oh dammit. my hart started racing. He was gonna follow me. I knew.it. Luckily for me he parked way on the other end of the lot. He asked me to wait for him cause he still wanted to talk. ""ok. Yeah. I'll be here..."" yeah right.

I packed my car quickly changed out of my sandy beach smelling clothes

As soon as I got on the on ramp I floored it and started weaving through traffic at 95mph trying to loose this creep. He already had.my cell number and knew my car. Luckily I was 45 minutes from home so I had plenty of time to lose him. thanks to my trusty Scion tC I was able to lose him after a 15 minute car chase. I got off the freeway

He started harassing me over text messages. Saying that he wanted me and he would get me one way or another. He would ask me for nudes. He sent me some of his own and I kept the messages to show the police if things went further.

After months of not replying to his messages he asked me ""are you mad at me? I didn't ask for nudes that was my friend messing around"" . Chills ran thru my body every time I got a message from him. I was on the edge at all times constantly checking my surroundings and started carrying a switchblade. 

One day I finally replied to a message with ""uh whose this? I just bought this phone with this number. U must have the wrong number""

1370633805.0,1fvrqo,Welcome to College,Laugh_With_Me,154,34,32,"(18 year old female) I've been stalked quite a few times in my life

I'd begun attending community collage, reserve a room in the library, and spend the day watching everyone's favorites. Everything was great until the second meeting. We watched Princess Mononoki and Kiki's Delivery Service and some other similar movies. Then Chad put in the last movie of the day. It was animated softcore porn. None of us knew what to do. We were all kind of socially awkward. He'd sat through our movies quietly and politely. Were we supposed to do the same? We spent the hour and twenty minutes red faced and casting each other horrified looks while Chad watched the porn with rapt attention. Finally it was over and he turned around.

""What did you guys think?"" he asked.

He was looking directly at me. That was the first time I noticed that I was the only female in Anime Club. Trying to be polite

""It was... um... interesting.""

I meant it to convey his *choice* was interesting considering that we'd all brought in Disney movies, there he was with his laptop trying to show me anime porn, seating himself way, way too close to me so we could both lean into his screen and watch it. Each time I would tell him, ""I don't really like this show,"" as politely as I could and move to another table, but he would move right back uncomfortably close to me and assure me that I would get into the story if I just watched.

One day he sat down next to me sans laptop and I heaved a sigh of relief. He pulls out a note book and shows me a drawing. It looks like a creepy robot uterus. Hoping I'm wrong

Thankfully at this point, noticed that Chad was following me table by table through the lunch room as I turned ever redder with embarrassment and came over. Chad fled before he even spoke. Chad was afraid of Vincent. Oh, thank *god.* Vincent was awesome and always in the lunch room. I could just hang out near his anti-Chad force field.

Vincent played World of Darkness with his friends in the lunch room, and gave him my character sheet. He informed me that I could keep whatever stats I had, but I was going to be taking over the role of ""Jenny,"" a long standing NPC. I asked who Jenny was, but was only told I'd get a huge kick out of it. So I attended, waiting for him to introduce me to the team.

They were playing the game in a seedy strip club setting. Everyone looked bored but Paul and a player named Bill, with an intense, unblinking stare that was always focused either on Paul... or me. I start to get a bad feeling, then Paul announces Jenny the hooker has arrived to service Bill's character. He turns to me and grins lewdly. Bill's searing focus locks onto me.

""I'm not playing a *hooker!*"" I yell. Paul looks crestfallen. Bill looks *enraged*.

""Dude

Paul eventually relents, but Paul insisted on sexualizing my character, and Bill just sat there across from me both games breathing heavily and glaring. I quit the game. Bill started following me. He never spoke to me, just sat across the room from me, glaring and snorting. With Chad. They were friends. Of course they were.

I had to abandon the cafeteria entirely, and he wasn't afraid of Vincent. Also, it really looked like Chad was encouraging him to do something while they stared at me whispering.

I left the state at the end of the semester, he told me that actually *everyone* was afraid of Bill, particularly Paul. They'd tried to disband the game because all Bill wanted to do was rent fake hookers, but he'd made veiled threats that he might do something insane if they stopped playing with him.

To this day I think Paul was offering me to Bill the same way you offer the crazy guy at the office a Snickers

1364238406.0,1azn86,Fake police carjacking... or worse,wemptronics,142,23,11,"Alright, but there's enough left unanswered that it still gives me the creeps to think about.

It was around 1:30am and I was driving home from a friend's house with my then girlfriend Allison. We had been partying a bit

Now, but you wouldn't want to be walking the streets alone late at night. Being familiar with the area I decide to take a little cut-through street.

As I pull onto the street I end up at a stop sign. I look behind me

I drive about another 20 feet and all the sudden I see blue lights in my rear-view mirror. Cop lights. Now I think, as I look into the rear-view mirror I notice several things that don't seem right.

For one, but they are not common. Secondly, the police lights are not on the top of the cab like a normal cop car, but next to the actual headlights by the grill -- like a detective's car.  I also notice there is an air freshener dangling from his rear-view mirror. I've dealt with police officers on numerous occasions, but I have *never* seen one with a stereotypical pine tree freshener. Lastly, as I keep moving forward, slowly contemplating the situation considering pulling over, no horn

If I had only noticed the first two factors I think I may have stopped, the position of the lights, and the lack of sirens was just too weird. I wasn't going to risk pulling over in the bad area so I decided to move forward at around 20mph until I got to a gas station.

The truck continues to follow me. There are a lot of speed bumps and road signs on this road, and if you don't they aren't going to stop at a stop sign to let you get away. This guy stopped when I stopped, moved forward when I did, and even turned as I decided to get to a more populated road.

After about 100 yards he turns off his lights, and peels away. It was at that moment I knew he was not a cop. I don't know exactly what I avoided that night. I drive a nice car, so it could be a car jacking, but I don't rule out something worse. If it weren't for my ex-girlfriend's presence I may have stopped.

When I was 14 years old, we ended up moving when my dad suddenly decided to retire.

I was lonely, as we finally updated to DSL. I was finally awarded unlimited internet access with no supervision. 

One night

After clearing up the misunderstanding, but mostly because I was prompted by plenty of questions. I found out the person I was talking to was a man, who lived in NYC, and was going to Cornell. 

After about a month of talking online, so I would know it was him. I answered in the middle of the first ring so my family wouldn't wake up.

We talked all night. He had a kind voice. I knew he was older than me, which was the number of my house address. I asked how he found out my address, and he said my phone number and last name.

Looking back

He was 27, different languages, having a family. He told me when I turned 18, he would marry me and take care of me. It sounded like a fairy tale. 

One day when I was 15, about how it's disordered for mature individuals to be attracted to young teens, how there's a huge gap in developmental stages. I felt a pit in my stomach. Why hadn't I ever thought of this before? How stupid could I be to believe that someone who is twice my age could be in love with me? I cried and threw up and couldn't eat for days.

I told him to never speak to me again, or I would tell the police. I didn't really know how to tell the police, but it seemed like a good threat. 

It's been several years and I've graduated high school, except for my hyperactive sexuality that I don't think would exist without him. A few times a year, he'll message me from AIM (which is connected to my phone number) and ask me how I'm doing, but I never respond. I don't know how. Sometimes I fear that I'll look up and see him somewhere, but then I remember I've never even seen a picture of him. ",,False,t5_2t3t8,True

I would ""ride my bike"" (aka walk my bike because I hated riding it) to and from school every day. I was terrible at navigating. I would pretty frequently get lost on my way to school or on the way back home. Not super lost

In October I kept noticing this red car. It was a little red hatchback from the 90s with quite a bit of rusting around the doors. I was a very daydreamy kid so I was pretty terrible at minding my surroundings. But even I couldn't miss how, and some days I'd see him again on the highway or even sitting in the parking lot of the gas station I would walk by.

This went on for about two weeks. I finally mentioned it to my mom

The day after I told my mom about the red car was a Saturday, I saw the red car at one of the pumps. The owner didn't seem to notice me, but I got a good look at him.

He was in his early twenties

On Monday I was feeling a bit jumpy as I walked to school. I was on the lookout for the red car, a white van pulled up beside me and was driving slowly along. I looked into the window and saw the young man who owned the red car. He was wearing glasses and had his hood up, but I recognized him. We made eye contact and something in me said, run!

I dropped my bike and booked it. I ran up to the first house I came to and knocked on the door. The man who answered the door ended up being a classmate's dad

A couple weeks later another girl (she was a grade younger than me) was approached by a guy who matched red car guy's description. She was playing on the playground after school when he tried to talk to her. She ran into the building and told a teacher and the guy booked it. After that we had a really nice police officer come to our school to teach us about stranger danger. But the guy seemed to give up after his second attempt with the younger girl and everyone just sort of forgot by the summer.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/12qz2b/red_car_white_van/
1342725207.0,wtyfh,My campfire story.,mndcndy172,145,23,19,"Earlier this year I went camping

I first walked over to the pit toilets to make sure they had TP, the parking permit that showed I paid for my campsite was gone from under my windshield wiper and laid in the grill. I thought it was strange, but figured it was the wind – after all, I hadn't seen a sign of anyone else.

I left the campsite and hiked about a mile to the small lake where swimming and fishing is allowed. I put a line in the water and walked over to the beach. I started to get the feeling that somebody was watching me, but every minute or so, somebody would throw a rock, make a splash, and then nothing – no giggling, no screams or “ghost” noises like I'd expect from a stranger playing a prank.

I realized that it was most likely one of my friends who knew I was up there and wanted to have a little fun with me, my side door was open. I expected everything to be gone and/or tampered with, but everything seemed to be in order. I assumed I had startled who ever opened it before they could do anything to my gear. I locked my van and went back to the lake for my fishing pole. The entire time I was aware that someone was following me, but they never did anything. This let me narrow down my list of suspects to 3 or 4 friends who have the necessary skill to sneak up on me in the woods. 

I grabbed my pole and headed back, and somehow chilling. I went ahead and set up my tent and got everything ready for the night. At the appropriate time (23:00 I'd guess) I announced - “Right! I'm off to bed, see you tomorrow!” to whoever was within earshot. I bunked down, but didn't go to sleep.

Some time later, I knew it had to be my friend who works for the National Forest, nobody else I knew would have done it. We might be assholes to each other, but we're always respectful and law abiding.

I sat up in my tent and said, but when I get out of this tent and you don't have a cooler full of beer with you, I'm going to bury this hatchet in your face!” There was no answer, just silence. I continued “Yeah, there might be some remorse, but I'll be over it before your body hits the ground.” 

With that I opened the tent, pale, blonde woman. I choked out “What?” just as she shot up and ran into the woods.

I did what I believe is referred to in the parlance as “Noped”. I broke camp and drove 20 miles away to a different campground. It's weird

1335875368.0,t1fgc,Angels and demons. ,,140,20,18,"I've been debating on whether to post this on Let's Not Meet for a while, as do the memories in general

My childhood was spent in the middle of the countryside, although we were on a hill so we could still see it from where we lived. The road by our house was long, but just your usual country lane, and there was never any traffic. Yep, it was a beautiful place, and pretty secluded. 

In my first memory of this, and my father was outside of our property trimming the tall hedges along the road to stop them from growing over (not really his responsibility, he's just a good guy). 

So I was doing my thing, shears in hand. He completely ignored my step-mother, until she began to loudly call out (our garden really was large) to him 'What's wro--', to which he got a massively stern look on his face, looked at her quickly and put his fingers to his lips, indicating to keep quiet. He got to me, and told me to come inside quickly. ""Come. Inside now. Quickly"" he said. I remember he said it gently and kindly

So we got inside the house, then he returned. 

By this time

Before my step-mother could say a word

""He's out there. He's only bloody out there. All this time.. He's bloody there. He's coming down the bloody road."" and then he shot a quick look at me.

My step-mother responded with an exasperated sigh, but it was replaced with something like annoyance. I was still terrified, and kept staring at my father. That's when he told me exactly what was going on.

There had always been a rumour, he specifically slept rough in the almost unused wood storage yard a mile from our house. Except it wasn't a rumour, and the man was about to be walking past our house. My father had encountered him a few times before I was born. There had been rumours of people having accidents, regarding this man. While my father was explaining, I had began to hear the outside shouting more clearly - at least, out of the continuous stream of words, I managed to pick out a few of the loudest;

""ANGELS... the ANGELS.. Deeeeemons.. NOW.. ALL OF YOU.. DEMONS

He took a long while to go past our house. All I could do was stand there and hear the shouting. In all honesty, and he would be a nice (albeit crazy) guy? 

This happened a few more times from that point on. I'd have to stay in the house whilst the man passed. Sometimes the man would sound extremely angry, to see if I could catch a glimpse. The positioning of the window meant I never did, though, because of the hedges. Every single time it happened, I wondered why we had to hide. Why my father was reacting like this. 

Any wondering about that almost completely melt away with what is now the very last memory I perhaps have of this man.

I was about 12 or 13, and he'd woken me up. I don't think he had woken my parents though. Anyway, my step-mother was taking me to school, my father already gone an half hour ago. We walk out of the front door and we spot a shadow underneath her car, which was on the far end of the driveway. Fearing it was our pet cat, my step-mother asked me to go and get him while she set the house alarm, so she didn't accidentally drive over him whilst we were pulling out.

I walked over to the car

I was looking straight into the eyes of a severed sheep's head. Right in the middle of the space under our car was a clean severed sheep's head. Eyes wide at me, and ambled back to the house.

""It's a sheep's head"" I told my step-mother.

""...Don't be ridiculous..?""

""It is."" And I just waved my hand at the car. I just couldn't speak anymore.

I then had to watch whilst my step-mother knocked it out from under the car with a broom. I saw the blood spatter on the gravel as we drove away. The car ride to school was in silence.

There is no proof it was that man. All I can say is that we live in the UK

He was also louder that day. Perhaps that means he was closer.

It would also explain a little more why my father feared this man's crazy.

This past Sunday (April 29th) I saw my father for lunch. I decided to ask him about the man, I remember' at everything I said, without offering much more information. He did let something slip though, in his mutterings about how he remembers..

I was told, going by what my father said on Sunday, that was a white lie. He slept in Bluebell Woods. The woods I could see across the small field outside of my childhood bedroom window.",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/t1fgc/angels_and_demons/

After the date

I returned my attention to my date and started to say something when all of a sudden I heard my side's door click open and the woman from outside was trying to get in. For being all skin and bones, but nonetheless terrifying. As I struggled I looked at her face; It was the scariest part. She was obviously very malnourished, possibly struggling with drugs. Her face looked more like a pure bone skull than a flesh covered one. Her skin was wrinkly, making her appear elderly, but no way she could be with her strength. Her eyes were bloodshot to the point where her pupils blended with the rest of her eyes. But the weirdest part was the color of her skin. It was grey. It resembled the color of ash, but not in the dry skin kind of way. Her expression was a mixture of desperation, rage, and my life could be in jeopardy. 

Realizing this, no automatic locks). So he hits the gas, and I kid you not, the crazy bitch held on to the door handle and was dragged along side us for maybe 30 or so feet. I told my date to make a left turn up ahead sharply to swing her off, and he did, and she went flying off. I looked in the mirror and saw her barrel roll to a stop. My date stopped the car for a moment, trying to compose himself. We both looked back and somehow she managed to get up within a few seconds and she just stood there staring at us. Finally, turned around

My date drove forward and we were both silent the entire way home. We ended up staying with each other because we were scared. It was completely terrifying

I live in New England (a northeastern region of the United States), cold, dark nights and short days.  One such night in February, I was alone in my parents' house, which is in a safe, quiet suburban neighborhood where the houses are within about 100 feet of each other.  My parents had divorced years before and were still on good terms, so when my mom decided to sell the childhood home

While in the process of moving, and the internet had not yet been switched over, so I often sat at the far end of the living room and mooched off of our neighbors' WiFi.  It was fun not having my parents there for a couple of nights, so I stayed up late with my new laptop and surfed the web into the early hours of the morning.

During my second night of being alone, as cars don't usually drive by past 10 at night, and neighbors stay inside to keep warm.  At 2:30 AM, I decided to head to bed, and was wrapping up my internet activities for the night when I heard three very slow, quiet knocks on the front door, just a few feet away.  I immediately closed my laptop

I got off my chair and walked very quietly over to the door and knelt down below a window to listen outside.  Frozen with fear, and he stood still with his arms to his sides.

I contemplated calling the police but ultimately decided to continue waiting.  I moved back behind the door away from the window, leaving.  Suddenly, he stopped, turned around, and looked directly at the window through which I watched him.  About fifteen seconds passed as we stared at each other, but I couldn't see his face under the darkness of his hood.  Finally he turned around and walked down the driveway and down the street.

I can still console myself that at least my stalker had a unique hobby. A quick google image search will give you some sense of amusement over it too.

Morris and I had the same circle of friends, but generally harmless. He was a big guy; over six foot, with a sad beer gut, long, lank greasy black hair and unfashionable, thick glasses. He had a way of speaking that betrayed exactly how shy he was - uneven intonation, rushed words

Most of us were into drama, and the next year I bumped into him a few times over one busy month in the party season.

It started with messages. They were pretty harmless. I got one every few days, look forward to seeing you again."" At first, I didn't know whether he was extending the branch of friendship or trying to start a flirtation, but he had always creeped me out and so I decided to ignore it. 

The next message, hope we can talk again soon."" Considering we'd had about a 5 minute conversation of small talk, I had no idea what deep and meaningful connection he thought we'd had. I ignored it.

 Next it became a little more obviously stalkery: ""Hey, I was going to go Friday night - not any more. I changed all my plans for the weekend to avoid him, and continued to ignore his messages. I also decided to stop responding to facebook invites and skip a couple of parties. I was freaked out that he was using facebook to track where I would be. 

I didn't want to seem presumptuous by telling him to just leave me alone. For one thing

For another, because some guys lash out and tell their own weird version of events. The whole thing just sounded like a lot of work, so I ignored it, hoping it would go away.

The messages continued, another message from my stalker!"" That is, until the last message, which came after about two and half months of short, ignored emails. I opened it up, message timestamped 4am, and it said to me ""It's clear to me now that this is never going to work between us. That doesn't change how I feel about you, to kiss you

What the WHAT NOW? YOU DID WHAT? Of course, called in my housemates and showed it to them; they were freaking out too, suddenly realising that if this guy was genuinely delusional this was a bigger problem than we all thought.

That

Suddenly the constant barking of my small dog begins to freak me out; one of my other housemates is so concerned she runs straight to the front door and checks it. Unfortunately

My consolation is that I'm about to leave the country for a two month vacation. I therefore email Morris back, but I am not interested, never have been interested in him, have never even replied to a single message from him, and basically have never touched him and WOULD never touch him. I even use the word 'delusional,' because not only am I scared, I am MAD. I end my message by telling him that I blocking him from all my social media and that I do not, want him to talk to me again

I thought that would be the end of it

Nope. I'm about a month into my vacation abroad and I check my email. My housemate has emailed me. I open it

 I tell her that if it happens again

Eventually, because honestly, again, I don't want to seem conceited, and I also feel like he has so few friends anyway, I don't want to ostracise him from them. He's weird enough as it is, right? People barely tolerate him as it is. 

But this is too much. Our summer theatre production is theatre in the park. A big, and long rehearshals will mean multiple nights walking back to my car in the dark. With Morris out there somewhere. I told you he was a big guy; tall, and solid. Well, I'm a small girl. I'm petite. I was freaking out.

I bite the bullet and go to our middle-aged, and tell him that I don't want to cause trouble but I'm scared of Morris because he has a slight history of JUST a little bit of stalking. I expect him to laugh it off. I even feel like I'm over-reacting; I mean, this was months ago now. But to my pleasant surprise, the director is actually very concerned. He takes it very seriously. Chivalrously, he even offers to kick Morris out of the production, but I'm too scared to agree to this.

 I don't want Morris mad at me for taking away one of his two social activities, word begins to get around, and I am approached by another cast member, who tells me ominously ""It's not the first time he's done this, you know.""

OH cool. Confirmation that he's really crazy. Just what I wanted.

Miraculously, but not quite so much that I don't check the locks on all the windows and doors before bed each night. When it's time for the end-of-production cast party, it's being held a block from my house... But I decide not to drink so that I can drive my car that one block, and not risk Morris following me home. It's been nearly a year since this started, and he hasn't spoken to me all summer, but this would be his last chance to do something crazy.

A few days later I was moving out of my hometown permanently, and I was ignoring him just fine until about an hour later. He came up to me and disrupted another girl who was talking to me mid-sentence. He's looming over me, invading my personal space, and I'm feeling my heart jump.

""So,"" he says in his weird, nervous, breathy voice. 

I realise stuff at the party is slowing down and everyone is turning to look at us

I just stare at him for a second

I didn't expect that he would try to grab me. In front of everyone, and he's just screaming into my face ""I GUESS YOU'RE JUST A BITCH, THEN! YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH!""

Nobody had expected this quiet guy to snap like that, has grabbed him, and every female member is pulling me back away from him and huddling themselves around me. My first reaction is shock, followed not by fear but by anger, again, and most of all, gratitude. I have never seen such an instant display of support from a group of people. They're all outraged for me, reassuring.  And now everyone knows he's indisputably bugnuts.

The guys drag him off and there are noises about kicking him out. I'd love that idea, Morris might be waiting, furious and drunk. It's just safer if I leave. My farewells are spoiled by the whole thing, but I make the rounds, make my goodbyes to all my friends, drive home, lock the doors, I've never seen or heard from Morris since.

I don't go back to my home town often, jokingly: one dark night somewhere on the street, I'll be walking along, alone, and then I'll hear it. Softly behind me jingling somewhere... The sound of Morris bells.",,False,t5_2t3t8,True
1368080016.0,1dzjnm,We almost didn't get inside the house in time.,braveliltoaster11,147,29,24,"So I just discovered this subreddit today

About four years ago, the house was almost never empty. 

So anyway, being central California, plus the house being empty had put me a bit on edge. To make up for the quiet, I decide to play a little rock band by myself. While I am doing this, all of a sudden the lights go completely out. Now of course, I feel ridiculous about this, but I get pretty nervous and start to imagine things creeping around, find my purse in my bedroom

I call my friend Jennifer and tell her all the lights are out, she suggests we go to a party down the street, so I offer to be DD since I will need to drive back to my place later anyway. So we go to this party for maybe 2 hours, I have only one beer while she knocks down quite a few and some shots, then we leave so I can drop her off and go home.

By now it has stopped raining so when we get to her place, and light our cigarettes and start to chat while standing in front of her townhouse. She lives in a generally quiet part of town, and being probably 1 am there is no one else around, even though her place is on an intersection between two streets.

Anyway, across the intersection walking down the middle of the street. He is tall with a pale face and curly black hair, and wearing tight black pants and what looks like a black sweater or turtleneck. Even though it's a little weird, I ignore him and we keep chatting. As we're smoking, Jennifer and I see him light up a cigarette of his own and keep walking our way (he's maybe 100 feet away at this point). 

Now at this point I'm still not worried, plus there's two of us and one of him. But as he gets closer he still doesn't say anything even though he's staring right at the two of us. Both of us glance at each other, feeling that nervous twitter in your stomach that you feel when something's not quite right. But we do our best not to stare back at him, thinking if he wants to come hang out, he'll say something and come over, maybe he's just shy or something. 

So we go back to chatting, I look back over slyly, trying to see where he went. 

And he is gone. Just disappeared. I whisper to her and ask her if she saw where he went and she just shrugs but seems a little weirded out too. We're not quite done with our cigarettes but I tell her maybe we should finish them in the courtyard (the implication being that it would be safer in there). So she walks over to the wooden fence and as we're trying to open it

At first I think I see nothing, looking through both windows of the minivan and staring directly at me. Without breaking eye contact he takes another drag and silently exhales, the plume rising again above the minivan.

Now is when I realize something is really not right and that we need to get inside immediately. Jennifer has gotten the wooden gate open and we hurry into the tiny courtyard and I tell her we need to go inside right now, in order to get into the house. 

So I pull the gate open and she is digging around in her purse trying to find her keys, but the only thing in sight is a red metal post pounder, that's too far in his direction and looks like it would be too heavy to grab and swing at him. 

The man's now in front of the van. Jennifer has picked up the keys, and starts to walk towards us, with a half-smile that doesn't reach his eyes, like he's a cat who is crouching waiting to jump on a mouse, and it terrifies me. He still says nothing, and I realize that if he reaches us, something terrible will happen. 

I feel a rush of energy and fright as I move closer to Jennifer and the door, figures out which one it is and is fumbling around trying to put the key in. I have a realization that if I tell her the truth, she won't be able to get the door open, so I quickly whisper ""No"" back to her as he is walking directly towards me, only about  10-15 feet away. I can see his hair rustle slightly as he takes another step, his arm starting to reach up. I feel every nerve in my body tense, wired up, and then it happens. 

The doorknob turns. The door gives and starts to swing inward and I shove Jennifer in, ""We need to get upstairs!""

We run up the stairs, and close the door. That's when I tell her that he was actually walking towards us. She looks at me terrified, and then asks if we should call the cops. My heart is pounding in my ears as I'm listening for any signs that he's trying to make it inside the house, or climb up to the window, but I can't hear anything and it's suddenly incredibly hard to think. Finally I nod, and she digs her phone out and calls the cops.

Normally I hate the cops in this town, but didn't see any sign of him. The operator was kind enough to stay on the phone with us while we waited for the cops. 

We waited in near silence for about five minutes, but we cautiously went downstairs and I opened the door after looking through the peephole and seeing it was a police officer with a maglite. We explained what happened and the cops spent a decent amount of time looking for him, but they were never able to find him.

1365536224.0,1c0cyr,Pillow Case,golightly25,141,21,21,"I used to live in a small housing development on the edge of my city.  We were surrounded by fields

One evening in winter I had been collected from school by my grandparents.  14-year-old female me assured them that I would be fine walking up the road to my house.  I'd done it thousands of times (in daylight) and they were just sitting down to dinner so I didn't want to trouble them.  For some reason

I switched my clunky school shoes for my trainers and set off.  In retrospect

Before my encounter, and branches obstructing the lights that did work, it was almost pitch black.  It was only once I was under the canopy and my eyes started to adjust that I felt more secure.

I was about two thirds of the way along, high-pitched squeaking noise to my right.  I didn't slow my pace but I peered curiously through the trees and didn't see anything unusual.  What the hell was that noise though?

I shrugged it off as some kind of critter and was calling myself a paranoid idiot when I heard it again, twigs snapping, leaves rustling, nothing.  Except this time, the weird noise was slightly clearer because I was paying attention.  It sounded like someone was crying.

I am not a naive person.  I am a worst-case-scenario kinda thinker

I started to speed up and then STOMPSTOMPSTOMP, save for a pair of socks.  He has a pillow case over his head with a big ovular eyehole cut out of it and he is thrusting his hips at me, making his flaccid peeper slap up and down.  With each thrust he makes this high-pitched noise, amplified, ""REEEEE-HE-HE-HE!!""

I was too startled to even scream.  My split-second immediate reaction was to run across the road on the diagonal so I was still in the direction of home.  Luckily (unluckily?!) there wasn't any traffic at all and I ran full pelt until I had passed the last tree on the left and my breath was ragged.  I chanced a look over my shoulder but couldn't see him.

I physically couldn't maintain my sprint any more, I knew they wouldn't have much chance of catching him.  Sure enough when my mum followed up with the police, they had swept the woods immediately and he was nowhere to be found.

At first

One day, so I often have people coming over to borrow my kitchen, sleep in between classes, study, etc. I invited her in. 

The conversation was weird. It's like she has this idea of how ""popular"" girls act (bitchy) and she's thinks she should act that way. I started getting annoyed, and her sitting on my couch and not moving at all. She went, ""It's ok, I can be quiet.""

I should have called for help now

So I told her

Finally, but she followed me anyway. She shouted through the door as I showered. She didn't even make any attempt to leave when I got out in my towel.

By then

Played SC2 for a bit and forgot about her. My room-mate eventually came back. 

""Um


From then onwards she would keep waiting outside my apartment. It got to the point where I had to hide in my friends' apartments until my room-mate told me it was safe. Finally I solved the issue. I really shouldn't be proud of this

I would go, you should just make a move...""

The boys rode up and the guy drove away. My brother asked who I was talking to and I realized it wasn't the step dad so we rode home fast. In the next couple of weeks we saw that the police were looking for a man on the news the Sketch looked like my brothers friends step dad and I told my mom that I thought it was the guy who had talked to me and she informed the police.

Day 1, I think to myself as I watch him walk up to the front door. My employer greets the newcomer and a similar welcome is exchanged with the stranger. It appears I wasn't the only one who got hired for this position after all.


The man is escorted up the stairs and introduced to me as one *Josh Powell*. I silently judge people upon first meeting them and this guy made it to ""possible child molester"" within seconds of talking to him. Something was clearly off


It didn't take long before I saw the full scale of Josh Powell's social oddities. He had a propensity for talking over people (including the boss), and acting generally douchey. Again, I associated it with some form of social inhibition. 


After we were given the grand tour of our new company, iterated over his need for controlling finances (I have no idea how he brought that up), and was fairly curt to the waiter who served us our food. The meal itself went over well enough, but I kept noticing these subtle comments and behavior traits that Josh Powell radiated. 


Before the day was over, and generally obnoxious. He made comments about things he *clearly* had no knowledge of and this was just day 1! Something is definitely off about this man.

I became obsessed with his case and was really tempted to try and befriend him in an effort to solve the murder mystery. I didn't get a chance

We never made it to San Diego. 4 hours into our drive we started experiencing mechanical problems. It started with a flat tire in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. Jason was a mechanic
Only 100 miles were between us and San Diego when the car decided to die completely. Jason flipped the hazard lights on and coasted over to the shoulder. Fortunately for us


2 hours later (and one incident of the lovely California Highway Patrol pulling their guns on me for no reason) we were in the cab of the Tow Truck taking us back a few miles to a small town called El Centro. We were dropped off at a mechanic's shop where they told us it would be ""awhile"". I was bored and hungry by this time. Jason and I decided that we would walk the main streets and window shop while looking for a place to get some food.

 
We hadn't been walking more than a few blocks when I heard a voice coming from behind me.
""Can I have me one of them cigarettes?"" an old woman said directly. Jason was a social guy, and her dirty blonde mullet hung in unkempt clumps in front of her eyes.

 
Her and Jason got to talking about the situation with the car
""I live just down the street. Do ya'll wanna come over and sit in the air conditioning for awhile? We can order pizza."" the woman says.


Every inch of me wanted to just say no


The woman turned on a dime and started walking briskly down the sidewalk. Jason grabbed my hand and we followed. Every few minutes she would look back and assure us that we would be there soon. I told Jason I didn't feel right about it


We finally get to her house. It is a little on the small side, but he was also very thin and lanky. He had medium length salt-and-pepper hair that looked as if it had never seen the contents of a shampoo bottle.


These people just rubbed me the wrong way. The man was very insistent on getting a drink for me. He came and sat down on the couch in the small space between Jason and I

""Why aren't you playing the cash cab with me anymore

""DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME? HUH?!?!? DO YOU?!?! YOU LITTLE BITCH!""

Nothing.
The phone was out of service completely. Dead. No dice.

 
I exchanged panicked looks with Jason
""Jason! Get up now


I couldn't seem to do three easy things: unchain the chain lock

 
High pitched cackles were emanating from the old, slowly but not breaking eye contact.
The next thing I know Jason had pushed me through the now open doorway into freedom. I bolted across the stepping stones and didn't even bother opening the small white wooden gate at the end of the walkway. I just jumped over it like I was hurdling in the 100 Meter Dash or Death.


Jason was a bigger guy, piercing shrieks of laughter coming from the house.

I turn my head and look behind us, covered in tattoos, Bald, combat boots, the regular punk gear. Us being punks too we didn't think too much of it. But me being 5 foot nothing, 90 lbs on a rainy day holding a brick if I'm lucky, was thoroughly creeped out.

There is this house on the corner of two very busy highways in my town that had been converted into two apartments; bachelor apartment upstairs and two bedroom downstairs.  My boyfriend, but when he lost his room mate he decided to downsize and take the apartment upstairs.  The landlord was a rich bastard and put no money into these apartments so there was no soundproofing, sinks with a separate hot tap and a cold tap, windows that were a foot wide, no doors on any of the rooms, the fridge and stove were about 20 years old and the apartment was on a steep angle.  For $350 a month though, it fit my boyfriend's budget at the time and the location was very convenient.

We got along great with them at first; smoked a few joints with them, and Alex even helped Luke with his laptop.  The first month they did a lot of celebrating with alcohol and a lot of sexy timing, but my boyfriend and I didn't complain.  It was their first apartment together and who were we to ruin their excitement?  Eventually the party came to an end for them and the honeymoon phase of moving in together had quickly ended.  They were fighting all the time, Luke would blast his techno music all day, the amount of alcohol they were drinking increased rapidly and eventually my boyfriend and I stopped interacting with them as much.  It didn't help though since the building had no sound proofing whatsoever; we heard all the fights, every word of them.

Soon Luke started building himself a little area outside where he could sit.  He built a small fire pit, Luke would blast his music to drown out Deb and eventually go outside to cool down by his fire pit.

Fast forward nine months and she pops out the demon.  Things went from bad to hell in a matter of weeks.  They were fighting more frequently, but after the alcohol gets flowing it is often hard to exercise volume control).  Soon it progressed to the point where Luke would purposely blast his music while Alex was trying to sleep.  I can remember one incident where I was attempting to fall asleep with Alex when Luke decided to start playing his music.  I took the speakers from the stereo, laid them flat on the ground and started playing some of my boyfriend's music to  see how much Luke liked it.  He didn't.  Soon the texts start coming (these are paraphrased as my boyfriend didn't save the texts):

""I can keep this up all night.""

My boyfriend passed the phone off to me and went back to sleep.  I told Luke that as long as he is playing his music then I would continue to play mine since Alex was trying to sleep and had to be up at 5 am.

""Oh good

I tell him I am not going downstairs.

""Fuck you. Come down here and I will shut you up.""

I again tell him I am not going downstairs.  He is a forty-something year old man and he is attempting to start a fight with a 22 year old female who is half his weight.  He keeps texting me after that telling me how Deb has a problem with me and they all have a problem with me and that I should just get the fuck out and go away.  I don't know what prompted him to start attacking me

Things only escalated from there.  We started receiving more aggressive texts, and the music continued to blare while Alex was trying to sleep.  The fights had gotten to the point where it sounded like Luke had begun to hit Deb (she would cry, scream in pain and tell him not to touch her).  Luke also began yelling at me through the floor when I was home alone.  Telling me how I was useless and did nothing to contribute to my boyfriend's life so I wasn't welcome there and how I was welcome to come downstairs at any time and deal with him face to face.  He had a lot of pent up anger towards me.  I really wish my boyfriend had listened to me and saved some of the text messages he had sent to me.

A couple days later I arrive at the apartment after work around 9:30-10 pm.  Luke is sitting out by the fire pit with about four empty cans of beer laying around his chair.  I pull into the driveway and he shoots me a glare. As I get out of the car

About 15-20 minutes later I hear a thump at the front door.  I asked Alex if he was expecting anyone and he told me that he wasn't so we ignored it and continued to watch TV.  I figured it was the screen door  since it had been broken in a windstorm a few months back and never really closed properly. Another 45 minutes go by and we hear Deb screaming ""PLEASE LET HIM GO!  OH PLEASE GOD LET HIM GO!""  I am on full ""what the fuck"" alert right now.  I peer out the back window and this is what I see at 11:15 pm:

Now

Now the kicker: our friend lives across the street and tried telling us what happened.  Someone had tried to break into the house downstairs and was apparently armed.  We go on thinking this is what happened.  I am scared out of my mind thinking that noise I heard at the front door was actually the robber trying to get into our apartment until the next day when I read this:

""O.P.P. have arrested and charged a 44-year old man in connection to a robbery and assault in [town removed]. Police say on Wednesday night a home owner came home to find his neighbour inside their house.  After a brief fight, break and enter and trespassing is Luke [last name removed].""

I am only sharing this because last night my boyfriend finally told me a little secret after a nice meal and a few drinks to celebrate moving into a new apartment.  When I walked past Luke that night and he had gotten up to walk towards me

I am now convinced that the thump I heard that night was Luke opening the screen door and trying to open the front door.

About five years ago, so often I'd run out of cash for a bus ticket (a monthly pass is $70, which was nearly half my paycheck some weeks), but it didn't bother me too much since I lived only about a mile and a half from the school.

The college is in a residential upbeat area

One night in the fall just as it was starting to get colder more quickly

Just as I was coming into the dark stretch, so I turned off my ipod, but kept the buds in my ears.  I could hear the man's footsteps as they trailed off a few yards, before they appeared to turn around towards my direction. 

I kept my pace steady, an older couple came out of the apts on my right, walking between me and the man.

I sent a text to my boyfriend, the older couple goes down the side street, creeper stays behind me. I try not to run across the street, into the parking lot, into the restaurant, leaving the man behind...or so I thought. I stand there waiting for the hostess for a minute, then hear the door behind me open. I don't look back, and says

Dread in the pit of my stomach, catching a look at the man in the light. He looks fairly normal if just a tad drunk and looks away when I catch his eye as I walk to my table. The hostess was chatty and sweet, and apologizes for assuming about my bf, since the guy was standing so close to me. I whisper that he followed me as I take the menu...and we both look up to see the man being seated at a table to the left of mine just on the otherside of a shortwall. Instead of having him tossed out, I told the hostess to keep an eyeout and that my bf was meeting me. She chatted with her manager and the wait staff, just in case the guy got weird.

Thankfully, a bit sad faced, we drank beer and went home without a hitch. Needless to say the rest of the quarter, I didn't walk home alone.",,False,,False,t3_1io81y

Often I had to turn down rides from strangers in trucks, making certain to pay attention to the cars. It was ALWAYS bad news when a driver passed looking at you, and doubled back. I noticed a man with curly hair in a tan car doing this on this day, and, since he didn't stop, I continued my walk. 

So the road I walked on was paved up the entire hill, As I continued into the forest I'd lost sight of curly, and started thinking instead about how badly I had to pee. I was at the gravel by the time I heard the noise. I swear that car was so quiet, he must have driven so slow behind me. He was at the very top, still on pavement, in his car, and the moment I looked behind me

Being a forest child really saved me. Instead of remaining on the gravel road, for the first time ever my key was the first thing my hand touched in my bag. I busted in the door, hyperventilating, and freaking out. My mom was home, and I told her immediately, but she didn't seem to give a single fuck. I guess she thought I was exaggerating despite the fact that I was bleeding from thrashing through all of the thorns.

It happened to me last year. I was 22 (f) and had recently moved down to Sydney from a more rural coastal town for work.

One night my boyfriend at the time and I were heading into the city for a friends party in a fairly dodgy inner city suburb. We weren't really sure of the address so we were walking from the train station kind of aimlessly. This was probably at about 8 or 9 at night and in winter so it was pretty dark and the streets were deserted as it was a residential area.

We reached the street the house was on but it was long and not well lit with those adjoined terrace houses so it was a bit confusing. We walked past this young woman

She muttered something like 'far from it' in a monotone voice then kind of lurched towards me. I was stunned but my boyfriend grabbed my arm and pulled me away and started walking briskly. The woman kept walking towards us but slowly, I could feel her brushing against me but she didn't say anything at all.

At this point I realised she didn't have all her faculties and was a bit irked by her silently glued to my side. My boyfriend wasn't a big guy and not great in a confrontation so I was not at all confident that if she turned violent or unpredictable he'd be able to do anything so we ended up pretty much jogging up and down the street looking for the house occasionally crossing the road/moving in between parked cars.

We eventually found the party and there were some guys outside smoking so the door was open and my bf basically pushed me straight inside. However the guys outside assumed the woman was with us

She sat down on the steps by the front door silently for a good hour after we closed the door. She eventually left because she wasn't anywhere in sight when we left the party (and we walked quick smart back to the station!). 

I'm sure she wasn't an actual physical threat but her appearance was well unnerving and the fact that she said absolutely nothing and followed us through all our dodging and weaving,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_1ererj
1366962215.0,1d54mt,Two is Better than One,MinusSide,142,24,33,"I'll make the back story short this time. I had a good friend named Connor who started dating a girl named Joceline when he was a senior. I was a freshman at the time. She seemed normal enough, and even started preying on the guys that I was interested in (while she was still dating Connor). My friend Connor didn't care. I figure he just wanted her around for a piece of ass after awhile.


One night while Jake (a guy I was pursuing) and I were over at Connor's house, ""Magdalene will never be mine, now."" I asked Connor about it the following day and he basically tells me everything Joceline has told him about me. It amounted to a lot of sexual fantasies. He told me that the other night pretty much shattered her world. He then tells me that if I want to do all of her fantasies (some including him), that he'd like that. At that moment, I decided I was going to cut them both out of my life.


Within a week of talking to neither of them, ""Hi, how are you?"" to ""I need help. I need you to help me. Here's my address..."" and the location would be in the middle of nowhere. At first, I figure it's just some stranger. Until I tell a friend about it, and she scrolls through her phone and confirms that it's Joceline's number. I had never given my number to Joceline or Connor (he didn't have a phone at the time, anyway.)


Then she goes to Facebook messages. She sent me about 200 messages on Facebook all together. I ignore all of them. She then starts contacting everyone I know and asking about me. They pretty much tell her that it's a lost cause and to stop trying to get a hold of me. For the next eight months.. this is no joke - she keeps tabs on me through a mutual friend. She occasionally sends a Facebook message during these months about something I was dealing with. Now I say it was all the mutual friend telling her this, and went into seclusion. I didn't hear about her again until a year later. She was telling a friend of mine that I was a ""frigid ice queen"" and that he should be weary of me. Real nice. 


Two years later - Connor joins in on the fun. I get out of class one day, he's acting really nervous. Keeps choking on his words, eyes are darting back and forth, and he looks like he's sweating. We make small talk. When we get to my house, I rocket inside. 


I don't know how he got my number either, he starts coming to my house. The first time, my brother answers and tells him I'm not home. The second time, he says I'm at work (he found out where I worked actually and asked my managers for my work schedule - they barred him from the premises). The third time, he tells him that I'm not interested and to go away. My brother decides to stop answering the door after that. He would come and knock on the door once or twice and leave. The last time, he knocked on our door for 15 minutes before he finally left.

I was working at a Holiday Inn in Omaha, greasy hair with a massively receding hairline, and a mustache. He has a cane and walks with a pretty severe limp. He asks me where he can get paramedic patches. He says he was called into town on special assignment to help out with paramedic duties, but they make him provide his own patches. This all seemed pretty damn odd to me, so I told him I didn't know where he could buy them, and he eventually left.

Later, and an old lady in a nightgown answered the door. I introduced myself, but she didn't respond. She just stood there motionless. Her mouth was agape the whole time, the way you'd imagine a lobotomized person to look. I saw a motionless pair of legs lying on the bed, but I didn't look around the corner to check it out. I went into the bathroom, turned on the water, and it was instantly extremely hot. The old lady never said a word, and I quickly left the room.

Later

When we got to the room, not saying a word. This time, I could see that the pair of legs on the bed were attached to an old man, now sitting. The old man sat there motionless, also agape and not saying a word, just looking at me.

I explained to the creepy man that I'd already been there

From the duffel bag, and he pulled it back in a ""Mine! Don't touch it!"" kind of manner. He held it out to me again, as if he were offering it to me. I reluctantly reached out to grab it, and once again he pulled it back.

The old man and woman kept staring at us

He then took a Donald Duck doll out of this bag. He held it out to me. I didn't reach for it. He kept holding it out. Kept holding it out. So I reached for it. He immediately pulled it away with the same ""You can't have that!"" reaction.

1351292973.0,125dqr,The car in the alley,RainingSilently,133,14,27,"This will require some explanation.  Several years ago I started a project that I have been writing on ever since: I went around interviewing professional criminals to ask them what they did for a living, extortionists

I was at a point in my work where I was interviewing women and men involved in the sex trade.  It started with independent prostitutes and expanded to include escort agencies and pimps.  I was looking around for my first pimp to interview when I was hit up by a prostitute I had already spoken to.  The girl was an Aussie living in the US, had a pimp that said he wouldn't mind being interviewed.

One of the most important skills I learned during those days was discretion and screening people before I talked to them.  Ironically this skill was taught to me by independent escorts who had to do that kind of screening to avoid cops or clients.  I asked her about the guy in a round about way and got a rough description: a big forceful black guy who strong armed most of the women under his employ around as well as several potential competitors.  She went on to explain that she often had to feed her dominican friend because her pimp would take all of her money and wouldn't hand over a dime even though she was starving.  Asking around on the grapevine of women in the profession that I had come to trust a picture soon emerged of an abusive and dangerous man who beat on other pimps as well as his women.  However he was a fellow known for his vanity

I started off the night without any particular worries: I'm a pretty big man myself

I drove into town, as eye contact in the ghetto can lead to a stare down, which leads to all kinds of crazy shit, but I checked a passing reflection.  Across the street was a car parked in an alley just sitting there.  I knew without looking that there was someone inside, and this feeling of being watched had a kind of malevolence that put me on edge even after everything I had already seen and dealt with.  I brushed it aside as some boogieman or other I had yet to interviewed and made my way inside and upstairs.

The apartment was the kind of temporary shelter common amongst traveling pimps and hustlers on the go: cheap enough to be in the ghetto so as to keep the criminal out of scrutiny

He made his best attempt to be charming and I humored him, to how fine his hos were, and finally to how he was muscling in on some other rackets to diversify his business.  I should have payed more attention to that last one.

My questions answered and I thanked him for his time

***********************************************

It was about a day or two later that we figured he must be dead.  I got the call from the Aussie girl that her friend was sleeping over at her place terrified.  When she had come back from working that night the apartment had been broken into and from outstide she could hear it being ransacked.  She fled back to the hotel room she had serviced her Johns in and waited to be contacted.  After a time she went back by and found that place broken into

When I got that call I went numb, and the careful timing of waiting until all of this guy's backup was out of the picture.  I had proceeded the killers in the alley's by only a narrow margin, and it was only due to luck that I hadn't come into the place in the middle of a murder.

I did not answer his question but instead gave him a look of LEAVE ME ALONE and I turned back around to look at the cashier and she can see that I'm feeling uneasy.

The guy then talks about me and him and about going out. All I could say was ""OK

1366723536.0,1cxmdy,Tried to commit suicide in my room.,LieBaron,176,57,36,"This is my story about how I was stalked. 

This is all over a little more than a year ago, about 65 kg, it fluctuates a lot between that and 70 kg - so pretty skinny. (sorry 'muricans, do your own math)

I met a girl, maybe 160 or so, very skinny and with very blonde hair and pale skin - almost transparent on both counts. She seemed sad at the time, so I asked her if she was alright and we talked for a bit, at first inside with the others and then outside, just the two of us. She WAS sad, her mom had died the year before, so now she was alone with her little sister

 After that night we became friends - I have a protective streak, play games, etc - she was pretty geeky. At one point we started making out, but I was just out of a relationship, and I made it clear to her that I wasn't interested in a girlfriend at the moment, but that I liked her as a friend and that we could do a FwB sort of thing, if that was alright with her. She said that it was, obviously a big mistake on my part. There is some drama - she is jealous on occasion

Anyway, but I'm getting the feeling that she's way, way more attached to me than she lets on, and I tell her that we can't continue what we're doing, but that I'll still be her friend if that is what she wants, after some time apart. Worst 'breakup' ever. She starts crying (prepared for that), tries to force herself on me (not prepared for that) and tries to block me from leaving. She's a small girl, but I don't want to hurt her

Anyway, pretty cool for most of the time. But it's pretty clear that she has major issues when it comes to me, and I soon have to put a stop to it - phone calls 24/7, she would show up at my door when I explicitly asked her not to, would threaten suicide, would not leave, etc. Basically put the responsibility of her own well-being in my hands, and trying to pressure me into having sex with her

I was reluctant to call the cops, but it was taking a pretty big toll on me after a few weeks of non-stop harassment, and so I called them one night, after my threatening to do so didn't deter her (it had on a few other occasions). Turns out, cops do not take you particularly seriously when you tell them that there's a tiny little girl outside your door - I was asked to just remove her physically (thanks cops, just tell me to assault a woman, how nice). One night I was drinking with my buddy when she came to HIS place in an effort to talk him into getting me to talk to her (at this point I've just ignored). My buddy (who used to live with her, albeit in a different block. Of course she freaks out when I'm there, just sitting in my room in the fucking dark, so I don't fear for my (physical) well-being. The next morning I try and talk to her

 She's in my bathroom, and I immediately wrestle them from her and call the cops. She tries to run away again, but I hold her there, and then they bring her to the psychiatric hospital. I come with her, being a stupid fucking nice guy again. We have to wait for the entire day - she doesn't want to be admitted, but her (2nd at least) suicide attempt and her family's history means that she waits for the psychiatrist to come and check her out. In the meantime we talk, and I tell her that if she gets treatment I'll start talking to her again, in spite of how batshit crazy she is. She calms down. But then the doctor finally comes (in DK where I live, just some young doctor fresh out of medical school, like I've never been before

And she did get help, I didn't come with her to the psych ward, since it seemed that she had only gone in an attempt to manipulate me, and she was trying to do the same thing again. 

After that, and at one point shows up with some of her friends outside my door. I was pretty freaked out then, as I know that at least one of her friends has gang connections, and her other friend is threatening me with her own connections. Our mutual friends also stop talking to her at this point - she is starting to transfer some of her erratic behaviour to them, and they won't stand for it, as they've really tried to help her all they could. I got stress/panic attacks at this point, and I'm taking a break this semester from uni to deal with that. It's been 6 months now without her contacting me, afraid that she'll start over again.

When I was 12, clearly tourists, who were trying to talk to the cashier and having problems with the language. I speak English fluently so I came up and help translated for them. Then I went off to browse.

They came up to me and thanked me for my help. Then offered to take me for dinner as a thank you. Even though I thought I was really grown up then

My younger sister was smarter than me and she ducked under their arms and ran for it. I was just frozen there stammering out excuses and they were moving closer and closer. Soon they were just inches away from me and I was sandwiched between them. I guess my sister got the shop assistant and she came over and asked what's going on and the two guys immediately moved away. I ran out with my sister immediately.

Now this is where I was totally stupid. I should have looked for my mom ASAP, so I convinced my sister we should just walk around a bit more. Besides, they were clearly foreigners so I thought maybe it was just a case of foreigners being foreign.

That's when we realized the 2 guys were following us. At first we thought we were just being paranoid, went straight for me, told me it must mean something we kept ""bumping"" into each other and we should really hang out. I guess their behaviour came off as a bit off to the shop assistants as well (guys don't walk in so purposely into a lingerie store most of the time) and they surrounded them and politely asked if they could help them.

My sister and I ran for it this time. We went straight to my mom's friend's jewelry store, obviously. The guy was so nice. He called up mall security, stayed right by our side the entire time and even offered us nicotine gum (he tried looking for candy in his pockets and only found that).

So we head to the back and it's this tiny little room filled to the brim with stock. There's no dog to be found. He comes out of a little door and says in Korean that the puppy is actually just upstairs (where  he lives

At this point, speaking in Korean, giving us this creepy smile, and gesturing towards the stairs. 

We get out to the main store area and he's still coming at us slowly, so we stand in front of it ... still smiling and nodding politely. 

He starts trying to offer us food and candy from his counter, push open the door, grab my friend's arm and yank her out with me. Once outside, she gives me a look of shock, but neither of us say anything as we promptly bolt up the street at breakneck speeds. I remember feeling the rush of adrenaline giving me so much more energy than I had only 10 minutes ago. 

We get back to her house and she tells me that the whole time he was talking, then asked if we wanted to eat some dinner with him. She was saying how she didn't know what to do because he was someone from church, someone that was always very friendly and in good terms with her parents. She was scared, but she was now scared of the repercussions - what if he called her parents and told them how she had stolen water from his store or that she had been rude to him?

1328397912.0,pb6bp,Running Away From [My] House.,,145,27,20,"While reading a couple of stories here

Well

All my life I've lived with an abusive father
He would get furiously angry and violent whenever we'd do... who the fuck knows what. Things we would consider nothing bad

One time I wanted to put on deodorant
I sat down on my dad's computer and left
I got hit

One time we were going to the barber shop. My mom always crosses her legs when she sits. 
It was summer so she wore shorts
He told her ""You did that on purpose

It was ridiculous.

It was bad. He'd sometimes be so mad at us

I'd sometimes stay stuck in my room for three days (yep

I hope you get the idea on how my dad is. He's also very big and strong... the more reason to fear him.
I'd tell my mom numerous times to divorce him... but she said she wouldn't.
My childhood is a blur because of so many horrible memories... he's even molested me.
I wouldn't tell my mom because we're already poor enough and didn't want us to be in financial trouble. I didn't want my family to be apart.

Jumping to the present
My mom passed away on the 15th of February two years ago

My brother (21) started to do bad things
He came home drunk one night and my dad got mad

He kicked him out, my brother is extremely academically smart).
It was just dad and me now. My  brother ran away to my uncle's house. 
Dad forbid him to bring anything with him

It was just dad and me for a long time... scary things happening
I tried to be strong
I thought ""If mom did it
People would always tell me, run away. Run.

I even started to have weird dreams... of my dad molesting me while I was sleeping. I don't want to know if those were real.
He'd sometimes wake me up getting REALLY close to my face

And now for the actual story.

I'm in my college's orchestra
Each of us got two tickets to go to see Lord of the Rings in concert.
I thought

I asked dad if he could take me. he got pissed and started telling me how I treat him as a chauffeur (not true

""Ok

He said no

The concert was absolutely amazing. My friend and I had a blast.

But for some reason my dad always loves to be a dick and ruin my most fun days (like graduation

But this night was *the* worst.

I called dad.
""Hey dad
""Who do you think I am
""Ok... I could always ask my friend for a ride.""
""No
Me, I can't park there!""
""Why not?""
""Shut up
""There's way too much traffic. Why not on the side of the center?""

He hung up. Fear started to dwell upon me because I knew what was coming. Another fun night ruined and going to get beaten.

A lot of time has passed and I started to wonder where my dad is (he hasn't called me).
Turns out he was parked 20 feet away for quite a while.

I got in the car
""I'm tired of your damn attitude

I was frightened all the ride home.
We got home

He kept bitching to me about the same thing.
""And turn off those god damn fucking lights!""

He would come in my room and turn them off.
He would always do that

He said ""You can fucking get out of the house

I thought for a moment
To run away from home.

Quickly

He said ""Where are you going? Are you going to our neighbors to cause more pity?""
I said ""No

I ran all the way to the main street. 
Now... this was at midnight

I ran behind a Jack in a Box. I knocked and cried but they wouldn't let me in.
I called my boyfriend to come pick me up immediately. I didn't have time to explain.
I saw my dad coming

There was a fight going on by the gas station. I was full of dread and other intense mixed emotions I honestly wouldn't care if I got killed.
I ran across to the street next to it.

There are a couple of bars there
I hid between the bushes on the Starbucks drive thru
I'd stand up a few times to stretch but I really didn't want to in fear of my dad spotting me.

I was afraid the drunks and bums were going to do something to me.
Thanks goodness they did not. One of them just asked if I had any money. I mean, like a 14 year old. 

I saw my dad's car pass a couple of times on the streets... I was very glad there was a building next to Starbucks so I was not visible to him on the streets.
I was very scared that he might go through the drive thru

I keep texting my boyfriend ""Please
(We live very far from each other
but it took him longer.

Finally
""Shit

I just stood up and ran like a motherfucker diagonally across the street.
I couldn't find my boyfriend but turns out he brought his dad's car.
I quickly got inside

I was still shaken by the whole experience. I still get chills when I think about it. This all happened three months ago and I haven't returned home.

Toward the end of winter

We got back to her house and set up for the night: Sleeping bags

Walked back and began to cut through the playground of a school because it was dark and the streetlights offered poor light. 

Standing on the basketball courts was a man, the dark and my own shadow so I immediately took this man as a threat.

He asked if we could help find his dog

He realized we were not going to stop and he was about 1m away from us and pulled a crowbar that I suppose he had slipped into the waistband of his pants and held it like a bat. I froze

He said ""Don't move. I won't hurt you.""

With his other hand, pants around the ankles. When he got closer to the light, I saw he had a bandana wrapped around his mouth and nose.

My friend and I turned and ran and he began screaming that if we just held still and stopped moving

I looked for my friend and she had gone a different way than I had and the man was advancing on her and this is what went through my head at the time:

I knew what he was going to do and I resigned myself to that fate but a horrible thought occurred. My friend was a virgin and had never had a boyfriend. I made the decision that I would convince him to rape me instead of her. It had already happened to me and I was already used garbage

I began running at him, but my screaming got his attention an he began advancing toward me. My friend took advantage that his back was turned and she threw one of the VHS boxes at him.

I grabbed her arm and ran. He was still screaming for us to stop

We stumbled into a convenience store and began crying and begging the owner to call the police. I had dropped my phone in the process. He called the police and also made us tea. It's funny that it's been such a long time and I can remember the tea in the styrofoam cup.

The police came in droves. They separated us and gave me a female officer because I looked the worse out of the two of us. I sat in the back of the car and tried to calm down to tell her what happened. I remember being very surprised that there was no room in the back of the car and I spilled the tea, despite the fact that I was probably making little sense, apologizing constantly for not stopping the man and crying.

They drove us home and explained that this guy was a repeat offender they were trying to catch

We got home and my friend began to cry hysterically and I sat there in sort of a numb haze. We agreed that we'd both still go to the city and 'make the best of things'. We tried to have a good time, I didn't want anyone to look at me and it seemed that black was better than the natural blonde I had.

In hindsight it sounds so silly, my friend's mother was very supportive of my friend and took very good care of her.

I completely moved out of the room yesterday into my new dorm, the RD, and the Housing Director about this issue, and that man knows how to get what he wants. I know from past events that he is not afraid to take legal action. 

I returned back to the dorm when she wasn't there to start putting my things into boxes. I got an email from my RD assigning me to another room, happening within a few minutes while I was trying to figure out what I needed most for another night away from this suffocating room.

""Did housing ask you to leave?"" 
""I just think that we both need our space now.""

""Why are you being so cold now to me? You weren't like this before

In my head I'm thinking, ""I just don't deal well with stressful situations and my courseload doesn't help."" 

""Can you tell me what I did to be a bad roommate so I don't make the same mistakes again with the next girl? What happened last night scared you off didn't it?""
Of course I'm not going to tell her all that bothered me because she was already using an angry tone with me and I didnt want to set her off. 

""I don't think that really matters anymore."" 

""It is because of last night right? I need you to answer the question right now because I feel like everyone is leaving me and I need to know why.""

At first I was a little sympathetic to what she said

""Look

""What did you go through last semester?""

""I had some major family issues that took me out of school.""

""What kind of 'major family issues'?"" She was mocking me at this point. 

""Ones that I don't care to discuss with you or with anyone. Now if you'll excuse me...""
I grabbed as much shit as I could carry and got out of there as fast as I could. 

One of my friends said she saw my roommate sobbing uncontrollably in the school cafeteria during dinner.

I came back the next day with some friends to help me move out of there. I explained to them the situation and told them not to be in the room by themselves just in case. All I had left to move were a few heavy boxes. When we were almost done my roommate came in

1348166241.0,107e1q,Lured into the basement at 3 AM,tkmac69,166,49,31,"I finally remembered this story that happened to our mom in my house maybe five years ago. I'll do my what I can

It was about 3 AM. Everybody in the family is home (my brothers, and my dogs). We are all sound asleep; except for my mother. She's startled by the barking of my dog, Trevor. Trevor is old as shit and generally an asshole, so we almost always disregard his barking; but sometimes you just *know*. 

She leaves the bedroom in her pajamas. The entire house is pitch black. As she descends the staircase

Trevor sees her in the kitchen and gets that alert look on his face

Anyway

Keep in mind my basement is very large and totally unfinished. There is a cold, and a few hanging lightbulbs with dangling pull chains. You have to walk up to them to turn them on if you want any light. There's no light switch down there.

So my basement is pitch black, the buzzing is becoming much louder. She enters the basement and it is very prevalent that the sound is coming from my dad's workshop, which is hidden in a little cranny on the other side of the stairs.

She doesn't have a flashlight.

She steps nervously on the cold stone ground and follows the moonlight around the corner. This leads her into the workshop

There's the sound. 

My dad's sander is plugged in, to save energy; and he surely would have noticed if he left it on. 

My mom calmly turns it off

""Somebody turned this on so they could lure me down here.""

She sprinted through the basement

It never happened again



**TL;DR:** My mom believes she was lured into the basement by a stranger playing with my dad's power tools.

NOTE: I am coming home this weekend and will upload pics of my basement for reference if y'all want it.

NEW NOTE: I went home. Forgot to take pictures. Was too busy to go on Reddit. Sorry folks :/

Including Batman.

Even though he denied it. (If he had a name other than Batman, and believed that he was Bruce Wayne, also known as -- you guessed it -- Batman.

I was never sure why exactly Batman was there, deeply, *scarily* mentally unbalanced, and desperate for female attention. The teachers and administrator took complete advantage of Batman's problems and personality, and used him as a sort of ""gofer"" when they wanted something. I once saw him run at a dead sprint at the height of a Texas summer to the Dairy Queen four blocks away, just to get the admin a Blizzard. He hung around all day long, creeping all over everyone...and I became his favorite target.

For as long as I was there, giggling. Batman began to stop creeping so much on other students, and would stand by my table and entertain me with the intricacies of his delusions. He may have been schizophrenic -- in any case, he heard voices. The loudest voice belonged to ""the Colonel,"" and apparently talked non-stop about killing people. He told me in great detail about how he was really Bruce Wayne and his ""stupid Mexican parents"" were just fakes, secret agents, who were working against him...I really wanted to bring up that the fictional Batman's parents were dead

As I got closer to graduating, and the day before the wedding my fiancee came in and, while he intended to get a crew cut, there was a miscommunication and the girl ended up shaving his head with no guard on the clippers.

The next time I saw Batman, it also made him look disturbingly like Bjork's crazed stalker. The one who tried to send her a mail bomb and then shot himself on camera.

The teachers were still less than helpful -- asking them to please keep Batman away from me, and that he needed to step up and make me see how much he loved me. I have to believe that they didn't actually mean me any harm, and didn't really understand just how unbalanced and possibly dangerous Batman could be. They didn't understand that this was probably the worst possible thing they could have said. They just wanted to stand back and giggle while I squirmed under Batman's creepy attentions.

My last day, Batman! You better do something!"" By the time I was leaving, I was extremely on edge. Batman hung onto me like a tick you just can't get at to remove. He kept offering to take me home, that I didn't need my husband, he'd take care of me, on and on.

The building was shut and locked up for the evening, who had picked today of all days to be late. I came very close to begging one of the more sympathetic teachers to stay, but she left, too. The only nearby phone was inside the building, locked up. (No one had cell phones then.)  I was alone with Batman, standing outside the building. I was scanning the street anxiously while Batman tried to convince, plead, I think.) He would give me a ride home

I kept insisting that I needed to wait for my husband. Batman got very intense -- he never touched me, I ran. I cut through the parking lot to the next set of buildings, ducking down behind a dumpster and keeping an eye on the road and parking lots. I saw his truck come back, cruising slowly through the lot, and then an adjacent one, farther away from me. When I saw his truck move on back to the street, I ran again

I remember standing in front of the store, I could run inside. My husband would be able to see me, hopefully, when he drove by, and pick me up -- otherwise I had no way of calling him. I was *definitely* not going back to the school.

Eventually, tearing open the door and bursting into tears. I never went back to the beauty school, or saw Batman again. I've known mentally unbalanced people before, been in dangerous situations before (I was assaulted as a teenager by a man with a gun, as one example) but I can't ever remember being as afraid for my life as I was standing there, alone, with Batman.

One day this single father and a little boy show up. OK, didn't show much, and it flagged my intuition. The little boy is a trouble maker. his first day there, he is already pushing other kids down. He is a bully that has some serious issues. The dad has a sob story that he just left his wife and she was abusive. The little boy starts to show up to youth events, and so does his dad. Normal. 

One day I am sitting in my office, maybe the other minister. After a few minutes, I hear a kids voice, so I step outside into the lobby area. There is the creepy dad and the boy. They are going through the cabinets in the office. I have no idea how they got in here, so I hold my cell phone and stay in the lobby with them. I say that I am about to run some errands and I have to arm the office, so they would have to leave. In reality, I was going to take a trip around the building to get rid of them. It is a ethics policy to not be alone with congregants in the building as a protection for not only the congregants, they go out one door, I couldn't do that. I had other obligations and had no room to fit that in my schedule. He sat trying to open my door for a few minutes, the creepy dad and kid were gone.

 The next week, but that is all. He got pretty agitated at this point. 

It was about this time I started getting weird text messages. I would get text messages that said ""you look so pretty today"" and ""I like that blue shirt"" almost everyday. Mind you, so I just ignored it. He kept calling it and laughing in the back of the church. He later said that it was him who had pranked me in church, so I knew the texts were coming from him, and I knew he was watching me when I wasn't at the church. 
About a month later, on the other had, said to completely ignore the messages, which i had been doing. 

Well, I was at a summer camp with kids at this point, and a fellow female minister looked at me while I was crying about this and basically said that this guy was a perv, and I needed to get rid of the guy. We had a co-minister who was a male  call the guy and told him to stop, or I would press charges. 

The creepy dad then went and complained about me to the church board, it was my job. It was at this point that the senior minister actually listened to me, read the messages that I had been forwarding to the senior minister from the creepy dad, and was shocked about what was going on. My supervisor didn't believe me at first saying that sexual assault doesn't happen in church from a congregant to a minister. It was at this point, whenever I did something in the service like pray or preach, creepy dad would walk at and stare at me from a window outside until my part was done and then creepy dad would return to the santuary. It was at this point that a congregation member who was friends with the lady minister above put things together and that he wasn't just sending me messages, but to 5 other ladies in the church. 

As things turned out, but we had a predator in the congregation that made many people feel uncomfortable. He ended up having to move because of his job, but I am still creeped out by him this day.

Like I said in my last post


Christmas day I was up at 7:30am and ready to get the day rolling. After opening gifts at my own house


I kept looking behind me, we hear the buzzing sound of the motion detector at the end of her drive. We look outside to see who it is and a red car is sitting at the end of the driveway. The lurked on for a few seconds and back down. I breathed a sigh of relief. The red car that pulled in the driveway WAS NOT the same one that was behind me, like I said the ones behind me were there most of the way but not the entire way. Both turned off at different points as I was going through the town. (Thank you to the PMs asking this, I was typing too fast to catch that I didn't clarify)


I was back in my town and at my sister's for the rest of Christmas by three. The drive back was uneventful and I was thankful for that. I was at their house enjoying a great time when my cellphone started ringing. I looked at the number but only PRIVATE appeared on the screen. The number called 5 more times before leaving a voicemail. I went into the bathroom and checked it. This voicemail was crisper than the others I had gotten from him.


""Hey baby. Merry Christmas. I can't wait to f**k you tonight, but when I checked on you, I noticed you were behaving like a good girl. Such a good grandbaby you are...Mmm good girls deserve to get nice gifts, right babe? I'll see you tonight."" 


I literally started to gag I was so scared. I called the cops on my cellphone, he was driving a different vehicle. His name? No, he never mentioned it. How does he know you? I don't know! Has he threatened you? Not exactly but he keeps talking about me being with other guys and being sexually explicit. 


After all the questions, huh?


I didn't see any suspicious cars driving by but I couldn't stop wondering if he was in any of the cars I had seen. It was midnight when I got a text from a number that actually had actual numbers.


12:05am
1********89
""Hey baby. I'm waiting. When are you gonna come out? I wish you wouldn't fight me! Always fighting me, yano that right? just come on.""


I called the cops again and gave them the number he sent me. They said they would look into it and get back to me tomorrow. I was told to stay in the house. I never replied to the text and I never even opened my door. The next message was the first one to get violent.


2:26am
1********89
""Why do you have to be a little slut? I told you that I didn't want someone touching on you! F*cking little bitch! Come out


I didn't know what he was talking about! I don't have a boyfriend so whoever he thought I was with in my house is beyond me. I called the cops AGAIN and told them he was getting more gruesome and threatening. They sent someone out to patrol. I didn't sleep Christmas night needless to say.


The next day


Now it is the 28th of December and I have taken it upon my self to obtain the necessary license and paperwork to own a gun. I told the police that I was doing all of this and they seemed apprehensive. But I will be damned if some guy is going to rape or kill me because I didn't have the right means to protect myself. 


Today, (my name). Love, Darren."" 


I called the police immediately and told them the name. I don't know if it's his real name or not. So as of now

1350283877.0,11i2tu,Secondary school Creeper,sheepinabox,133,17,19,"When I was in secondary school

I was very shy back then. The boys in my class used to bully me, though most of them only lower themself and talk to me if they needed the answers to current exercises/homework, since at least I was pretty smart.

The only time I was in a different class was during math lessons. I pretty much suck at maths

* In Class A were the ""smart"" people. There you´d find the geeks
* In Class B were the more wierd people. The ones walking around in baggy clothes who were constantly caught smoking or taking snuff.
* In Class C were the dumb people. I can´t describe it any different. The roughnecks

___
Note: This of course was the stereotyped thinking of a teenager. 
___

Although I didn´t get along with *everyone* in my math class, or for not wearing make-up. (I´m allergic to most of this stuff, so I was pretty bummed about that) They simply didn´t give a fuck.

Amongst my class was a boy, I noticed he often turned his head to look at me. Sometimes randomly while we´d have to do exercises, sometimes when I had to anwer a question.

One day he walked over to our group during lunch break and asked if he could talk to me. He made compliments, I´d already heard some rumours and gossip about him. Turns our many girls had already been approached by him, and the general opinion about him was that of a horny wierdo. 

Our schoolyard was rather small, boys either way pretty much avoided me in large curves or were being douchebags, and my self-respect wasn´t exactly high. Hearing stuff like ""You´re pretty"" and ""I like you"" made my brain go complete mush. 

One thing led to another, I either way wrote stuff like ""That´s so cute of you"" or ""&lt;3/:)"". I became pretty scared of him over time. He began to get more and more pushy, often trying to kiss me and calling me his girlfriend to others - even though I never said or agreed our relation was more than friendship.

The occurence that finally made me flip my shit was when I was at a friend house on a wednesday afternoon. We always had a free afternoon on this day, ""why aren´t you answering me?"" and ""PICK UP THE PHONE"" - over and over. 

I didn´t tell anyone about this at first. Next day in school I told him to stop sending me messages or calling me. I had already rejected an offer when he wanted me to come to his house for dinner while his parents were away and was generally creeped out. I wanted him to stop talking to me

He agreed, because I never used my phone a terrible lot lurk on Facebook.

Then, he had to walk pretty much the opposite direction. I didn´t notice him at first, only feeling the tingly sensation of being watched, which I simply brushed off. There were many other students taking this way. One day I was walking with a friend, who decided to stay over. Halfway home she pokes me and asks, if Stefan had recently moved house(she knew about our ""relationship). To my confused question why she´d think so she answers ""Because he´s been following us the whole way."".

I asked the guys in my math class the other day if Stefan had recently moved to another place. His best friend declined

A few weeks passed, trying to catch up with me. Sometimes he´d ring the door bell, to which I never answered, always waiting for him to give up and leave. Back then we lived in a five story house. My room was on the second floor and the only window pointed towards our garden. We didn´t have a fence or anything, so anyone could walk around our house and look into the living room - sounds absolutly fantastic, right? We never had any cases of theft or break ins though, because we lived near a farm which had this huge dog running around. He wasn´t exactly a guard dog though. He´d bark and yap at every fluff passing by

Winter came by, my parents had already gone to sleep, I heard faint shuffling noises coming from outside. I look down, only to see someone standing in our garden, staring up to my window. The glass door to our garden has a PIR. If you went near it, the lights around the house would go on - they were very bright, enlightening the whole facade.

I don´t think I need to tell you who I saw, which had started to fall shortly after dark. I told my dad about Stefan, showing him some of the text messages he had sent me (not the inappropriate ones, of course). He assured me he´d take care of it, him being your typical over-protective father.

The next night, this time with more distance so he wouldn´t set up the light. I was trying to get to sleep at this moment, when I heard my father yelling. I looked out the window and saw him grabbing Stefan by the collar of his jacket.

 Now, while Stefan was about 1.50m. Dad lifted him up until his feet dangled over the ground, yelling at him to leave his daughter the fuck alone, and if he´d ever catch him again on this property, he´d shove his fist straight up his ass.

Needless to say

I´ve recently added him on facebook - it´s been six years

1346923246.0,zfxqf,Timmy,cincharge,151,34,47,"Alright Redditors

This story takes place over about 3 weeks during a summer in the early 90s. I was almost 9 years old and about to go into the 4th grade. My parents

Living as close as I did, a 16 year old girl who sported a heavily teased, blonde hairstyle, humidity be damned. After getting all checked in, I was introduced to the only other kid there, Timmy. On the surface Timmy was actually pretty adorable; he was tiny with auburn hair (I know, I know...a ginger, big brown eyes, but as a young girl about to enter into this pre-middle school phase of my life I was willing to be polite

As that first week went on, but not the rough and tumble boys his age. Unfortunately this led him to tag along with me, the first person around his age I guess he felt he had connected with. 

For the first week and a half, etc. But it wasn't long before he began telling me that he thought I was beautiful and that we were boyfriend and girlfriend. That was more than I could bear; he was cramping my totally awesome style as it was, and if the girls I hung out with caught wind of this it was OVER. I took him to the tire swing and in the nicest way possible told him that I thought he was really sweet, but that I needed to hang out with people my own age. I could see he was sad, but he shrugged and sighed, ""Ohhhkaaayyyy,"" in agreement.

We had weekends off from day camp

""Hello?""

""Hi Cece!""

""Who is this?""

""It's Timmy! I missed being away from you soooo much so I called to tell you that I love you and can't wait to see you on Monday!""


I know that it all sounds fairly benign and perhaps even sweet in our adulthood


""Timmy? How did you get my phone number?""

""Miss Stacy had it in her papers.""


That's right; little dude jacked my phone number from the counselor's roster. 

I told him that I had to go and ended up having to hang up on him because he wouldn't end the call without me saying that I loved him.

I tried to get out of going to day camp on Monday

""Why are you being so mean?""

""I'm sorry


He sighed sorrowfully. What he said next and how he said it will stay with me forever.


""You must think I'm a fucking asshole.""


Now, the words themselves hit me like a ton of bricks. I immediately ran to tell the counselors, with Timmy running close behind. As soon as he saw them, he mustered up some fake sobs. I whispered what had been said into Stacy's ear, and she looked at me with complete shock, although not in the way I expected.

""Cece! Timmy would NOT say that. Did you say something bad


His eyes got ""Disney wide"" as though he were the most innocent creature in the forest.


""Never ever

""You see? Don't make things up


To this day, is the absolute worst.

With that, his face was cold and unfeeling.

The next day at day camp

He found an opportunity with me towards the end of the day when most kids had already left. I was alone at the tire swing and he approached me with the coldness I had seen the day before. I was a little scared

""Timmy


He ignored my question


""You're not going to get away from me. If I want to have you


With that

My parents were bewildered by the tantrums I threw to get out of day camp, and even though it was out of the way, I got dropped off with an aunt for the rest of the summer.

I was afraid he would call again, until school started again...

About the second or third day in I was walking down the hall at the end of the school day. I passed by what I thought was a third grade classroom getting their things together to go home for the day when I spotted him. He was standing away from the class in the middle of the hallway, spun on my heels and ran to the nearest girls' bathroom where I locked myself in a stall. A nun yelled at me, but it has never been more worth it.

And I never saw him again. What's even stranger is that he never appeared in any yearbook from that year or any year before or after. It's as if he came to school that one day and left when I wasn't happy to see him.

Sorry for the long read

I never understood why and always chalked it up to growing up without a steady Dad. Until my mom shared 2 stories with me. I was 5 at the time

The first one was short and sweet. We were walking down the street, he bent down, grabbed me under my shoulders, and started walking away. No word, no sign. Just grabbed me. My mom still had a hold of my hand and she ripped me from him and ran straight to the police.

A while later, and would stop on the side of the street and just chat with me. I don't remember, but I guess I told my mom about this guy after a while and she told me to stay away. So I wouldn't talk to him, but he still followed me. So my mom had me stay closer to home, and made sure that someone walked me to school each day, and eventually we just moved away.

1375164851.0,1jc02z,Stay Away From Pete,InnocentLove,151,34,19,"When I was 15

Pete and I were only dating for a few weeks before he started pressuring me into having sex. If I told him ""no"" he would get angry. He would tell me that he could find another girl and I was lucky to have him. I believed him and let him talk me into it. He would make me feel guilty if I told him I wasn't in the mood. What Pete wanted

A few months later, and 16 texts. I called him and apologized, telling him I had to stay after school. When I got to my car, he was waiting there. He flipped out on me and accused me of cheating on him. I apologized again and promised to always let him know where I was. He also told me that I needed to stop dressing so ""slutty."" I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt. 

Over time, I wasn't allowed to talk to them. Even if a guy talked to me first, I would just make up some excuse as to why I had to leave. A little over a year into our relationship was the first time he hit me. We were arguing about him wanting me to move in with him (I told him I was only 16 and not ready). He was yelling at me that I didn't really love him and that I was sleeping with other guys behind his back. He said that if I didn't move in with him, he'd break up with me. I said ""Fine."" Well, it wasn't fine. We started physically fighting, and I left.

I broke up with him for a few days before he convinced me to get back together with him. Things were good for a while (physically better, things only got worse. He would force me to have sex whenever, with the premise that he paid rent and I should be appreciative of that. I'm not saying I didn't want to have sex, but he wanted it whenever, wherever. A lot of days I wouldn't even go to school. He had already dropped out of college. It got to the point that he was physically abusive  more often than not.

About 10 months after moving in with him, I spent all day everyday at home. I wasn't allowed to leave the house when he wasn't home, like I was a child (plus I had no means of transportation). I hadn't talked to my parents in months (thanks to him). I had a cell phone that he checked daily, and was only allowed to talk to him. It was terrible and yet I was too scared to leave. 

That night, in that moment, I thought ""Maybe if I stand up for myself, he'll leave me alone."" Wrong. I punched him in the face and he looked at me shocked. His nose was bleeding. He looked like he was about to walk away. Then, he grabbed me by the hair and started beating the shit out of me. 

I ended up in the hospital with a broken nose, my entire face was bruised, a broken wrist, amongst many other bruises. He dropped me in front of the hospital once he realized the extent of my injuries. He told me to tell them that I was mugged. Are you kidding me?! He left me there. I told them the truth and he was arrested. I moved back home with my parents. I stayed with them for a year before moving cross country.

I haven't seen or spoken to Pete in 7-8 years. The last I heard, they won't stand up for themselves. Well, I did. ",,False,,t5_2t3t8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1jc02z/stay_away_from_pete/

I was in charge of the girls aged 11-14. They were...difficult, withdrawn from the other kids, and never wanted to listen to anyone. One day I took the girls back to the cabin after lunch for quiet time and she asked to go outside. One of the other counselors volunteered to go out with her and anyone else who wanted to go because she knew I needed a nap, so they went and I caught some z's.

I was awoken about fifteen minutes later by the counselor who was frantic. Katie wasn't to be found. Could I help her look? I sent two campers to the office to tell the director that there needed to be a lost camper alert, threatening, pleading, etc. I eventually found her sitting on a rock, and in her hand was the biggest goddamn knife I have ever seen.  I calmly asked for it and she shook her head. ""I need my tools,"" she said firmly. I sat down next to her, keeping my eye on the knife, and that she planned to hurt the people here she didn't like. It was fucking chilling to listen to her. Her voice was very calm

I was almost shitting myself at that point. I don't know how but I managed to grab her wrist that was holding the knife and held it above her head. I yelled for the camp director who was searching the woods with a couple other counselors (as per regulation) and she rushed over and saw me manhandling this kid who was biting the hell out of arm trying to get me to let her go.

1357878769.0,16d0ol,Trevor?,elfinette,141,30,18,"
When I was in my first year of high school (grade ten) I was in a class called Leadership. We would organize school events, and we would organize all the dances.

One of the quieter guys in the class was Trevor. Trevor was quiet and never volunteered for anything. His jeans were always filthy and his hair usually unwashed. He was new to the school and usually sat off by himself. I noticed he had a couple nervous twitches and hated to show his teeth when smiling or talking.

I volunteered to make a banner for some school pride thing. Me being in the class was a bit of a joke really, Ms Frink, decided that Trevor had sat on the sidelines long enough and paired us up to work on the banner. I could have handled it myself, but I knew what Ms Frink's motivations were, so I decided to extend an olive branch of friendship (or at least civility) to Trevor.

I sat next to him that class to sketch out ideas. He was very shy and would hardly make eye contact. I told him that I only live five minutes away from the high school

We met outside the school office and walked to my house. I tried to make polite conversation, but my brother was in the same room watching *Serenity*, so I felt safe.

We sat on the floor and colored the banner with big markers. I asked him if he had ever watched Firefly, he grabs me by my shoulders and sticks his tongue in my mouth mid-sentence. Seriously- just stuck his slimy tongue in my mouth, no warning. I pushed him off of me quite quickly, but the damage was done. I told him that I unimpressed with his behavior and told him to get out. He left and I finished the poster alone. My oblivious brother didn't notice a thing.

That night, Trevor's usually quiet voice was confidant and slightly slurred. He told me he loved me and asked me why I didn't love him back. I told him that he was drunk and that I was hanging up now. He stopped me with this gem-

""If you hang up I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself and your dog. I'll shoot your dog.""

""No

Around 10

""Trevor

""Say you love me or I'll shoot myself. I will shoot myself and you."" My mind was racing through every possibility. If I ran, ""I am going to kill your family.""

Now, don't do what I did. Run away and call the cops. But when he said that, I pictured my little sister in her bed. Eight years old. Honestly, since my mom worked night shifts and slept during the day, I'd been looking after her since she was a baby. And the thought of this guy hurting her filled me with rage.

I ran at him and tackled him to the ground. I threw all of my 108 pounds into it, and proceeded to punch him in the face a couple of times. It was after I got a couple blows in that I realizes he was shouting something.

""It's not real! It's not real!!""

I stop. I stare at his face for a moment. I'm breathing hard. He looks like a scared little boy. I get off him and run to grab the gun from out of the street.

It's a lighter. A heavy, breathing deep to calm down, before going back inside. When I do, my brother doesn't look up from his computer game. I wrap the ""gun"" in a couple garbage bags and put it in our trash bin. My mom was already at work, so I never had to explain what happened that night.

The next day I went to the police liaison at my high school and told her what happened. She wrote down everything I said and thanked me for telling her. I don't know what ever happened to Trevor

  At first, I must say), but after the third session or so, he started to ask random question. The class was about the medieval and modern depiciton of Jesus Christ (I don't know why I was taking that, but the professor was great and she is always able to make things interesting) and Herbert always tried to start some discussion about church, how it inflicts misery on the world, etc. - absolutely unrelated to the class, akin to Jesus. When he spoke
 
  Fast forward a few weeks, energy drink, etc. He tends to mix together the bottles remaining contents and drink it in class. Which was, I might add, kind of disgusting to watch. Of course, he is still always late and his questions continue to be weird. One time, he asked another student for her book, so she agrees. But he takes her book
 
  Another friend told me that, looks out of the window for a few minutes and then sits back down. Other professors noticed his behaviour, too, and friends in the student council tell me he is a regular visitor in their room, talking about random stuff and refusing to leave.
 
  Next week or so, always asking which topic he should cover. She talked to us about what to do since his behaviour was becoming more than distracting and you could see that she was concerned. Since it didn't look like he would show up at all, the session continued without him. He did show up though, _only_ 80 minutes late (of a 90 minute session). After the professor closed the session, Herbert raises his hand and asks: „Can I now please start my presentation?“ She replied: „Well, you're way too late for that!“ „But you can't do that, I'm from Dortmund!“ (a city that is 30 minutes away from my university)
 
  Once again, he appears in their room, talking about random stuff and how he went to the firing range the last weeks and mumbling stuff like ""you always meet twice"".
 
  Even more stories surfaced. Apparently, there seems to be a peeper on campus, since someone tried to film female students going to the toilet. Now campus security is patrolling the corridors, especially around the classes Herbert enrolled in.

This all took place in Northern Delaware. Involved me 13, and my friend Louis (12-13). It was summer time of 2007 and we were all riding our bikes to a local park that boarders the Delaware river, with New Jersey in close view across the water. Anthony and Matt loved to hang out with all their friends there and I loved even more to tag along. They were really cool friends, they never shunned me for being young and they never acted like they had to censor themselves, so as a 14 year old I thought this crowd was [the bees knees](http://larrydixon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bees-knees2.jpg). I always looked up to my brother, he was the epitome of cool to me. He was very smart, if you ever wanted to know something you could ask him and he knew it all. Machinery? Yep. Circuitry? Uh huh. Carpentry? Yessir! But he was also really street smart because before our father died he had raised Anthony just as he (Dad) was taught in the military. We could literally walk into a room and Anthony would sometimes say ""There are (Insert number) of people wearing (insert object)"" and I thought that was amazing it was like he was from that show ""Psych"". 

It's about 9pm and the sun is setting

1. He senses something is off.

2. He is thinking about something. 

I shrugged it off as the second since he spaces out [alot] (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png). It's very random but he will sometimes do it in the middle of sentances while talking

We keep talking and are talking about a fort we found in the woods a couple weeks ago, down the pathway. We knew that he knows someone is there and since there aren't too many trees in this part of the park, the moonlight makes for O K lighting. But we still couldn't see what he was looking at. I personally thought it was the patrol getting ready to leave, but when I said something to him he told me the patrol would have flash lights. 

He told us to keep talking and act normal, and I didn't help that he was in this phase where he ALWAYS carried [this] (http://www.trueswords.com/images/prod/c/TS-FTBRNSOD17_540.jpg) around with him. It is a 2ft thin blade that fit easily in the inner waist area, so it was basically going down his outer thigh. 

We started talking again, and let him know of what I see. Without even looking to his right, he keeps his eye locked on mine but looks as if he isn't looking at me at all, and just says ""I know I see it too"". 

we watch this guy do a half circle around is for 15 solid minutes, which was about 50ft or so. At this point I guess he realized he is skulking and turns his skulk into a suave like stroll. It's so fucking weird to see someone try and change their sway like that. He was about 5'5-5'7, he had on tight black pants, with black boots that I can only describe as the boots that the Columbine kids wore, a coat that flowed to the bottom of his butt, long black hair with a receding hairline and a small goatee maybe about in his late 40's. He just kind of stood for a second like he was aloof. He let out a small cough, to start off his sentence, hoping he would be on his way and maybe just scoping out what we were up to. But he didn't, yes, but left the latter unanswered. Anthony in his sternest voice told the man ""You should probably be on your way"" while motioning his hand to his waist. He looked at me square in the eye and said ""you kids shouldn't be out this late

We get up after a couple minutes and walk across the park to our bikes. Anthony looks back and notices the guy no longer at the bench, she told us she didn't want us there anywhere NEAR the sundown. I soon told my mom of said even and she flipped shit. She went to work and read the report, along with adding our description or Keyser to it. She later told Anthony a month or so later that they found a large hunting knife, and lube in a tree near the hill (Theres only 1 hill so it's THE hill) The SAME... SAAAAMMMEE hill Anthony and I noticed him first emerging from. 

I have no clue how this would have turned out if Anthony was't there. We still bring it up from time to time but it always gives me the chills.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/qsh1k/i_can_never_repay_him/
1375090541.0,1j9n5v,I still get shivers when I hear car horns,streuthguy1,139,26,15,"This happened a few years ago when I first got my driver's license, it was known to have a few weirdos around


I had been driving for ages, it was the first car i'd seen in a long time, and although it seemed a long way behind me it started to catch me fast. I was driving my twenty year old Ford wagon, and was driving about 110km/h, but this guy was coming up REALLY quick.


Soon after I saw the car, I was alone, I didn't even have phone reception. It gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, I had a strong feeling this person wanted to mess with me.
After a while this car finally pulled right up on me, I was trying to wave him around me, but he wouldn't go. I didn't want to slow down but I couldn't outrun him, so I was sort of stuck. At this point he started flashing his high beams, which made it really hard to see, and then he started hitting my rear bumper, really smashing it.
I was trying to keep my shit together enough to keep my car on the road, and the honking that was driving me insane. All this was happening at around 100km/h (60+ mph), and eventually something had to give, I swerved off the road, luckily it was on open field, slammed on the brakes, the car did a full 180 degree turn and I slid backwards into a small ditch.
I checked myself quickly, and then turned around, drove slowly towards me and started that fucking honking again.


I panicked big time. I put the car in reverse for some reason and slammed down on the accelerator... big mistake- I just dug the car in to the soft grass. The truck was driving in to the field towards me, but now they had run me off the road, and were coming back, still honking the horn, obviously not coming to see if I was ok.


They pulled up close to me, and finally decided to put it back in drive. By this point the honking had stopped, and someone had stepped out of the drivers door. This person was short and fat but all I could see was their silhouette, and this silhouette was now walking towards my trapped car. I took a few deep breaths, I was shaking and terrified, and slowly eased the pedal. The car was moving but my wheels were spinning and I didn't know if i'd make it out. The person moved faster now and got up to my door. I locked it in the nick of time when pulled the handle, so he just started knocking on the window. This was fucked, he just tapped on it

The honking started again and pretty soon I saw the truck was racing to catch up with me again. FINALLY a car came in the opposite direction, I saw in the distance the lights of the black truck stop, turn around and zoom off in the other direction. Thank god for this woman, she calmed me down and took me to the police station. I gave a statement and everything but I didn't really see anything but a short fat silhouette and a black truck, so no help there.

1372084914.0,1gyy5v,Always trust your instincts.,kristimarie8799,138,25,118,"When I was fifteen I went to the beach with my family. One night my younger sister and I decide to walk down the main road where all of the shops and hotels are. We notice a shop advertising body jewelry. I had got my tongue pierced about six months prior and was happily looking at the tongue rings. There was a group of three guys standing near the counter talking to a man working there. The man that worked there came over and started suggesting tongue rings for me. He kept saying he thought the one with the number ""69"" on it would be perfect for me. I had always hung out with people a bit older than me so I knew what he was trying to get at so my sister and I both left very quickly. 

We got down the street some and the three guys from the first shop were behind us. They didn't say anything at first so we continued talking and enjoying the beach. Then one of them asked if we had a moment. I looked behind me thinking it couldn't be *us* he was talking to. He was at least six feet tall and maybe in his mid twenties. We kept walking and the ring leader kept asking us to stop.

The ring leader finally said ""Hey girl in the white dress. Don't ignore me!"" I stopped and turned around. I didn't say anything I just raised an eyebrow while making a circle motion with my hand as if to tell him to hurry up and say what he wanted. He did it back and I laughed it off thinking maybe he wasn't that bad since he seemed to have a sense of humor. 

He started telling me that I was ""Pretty damn sexy"" and made remarks about ""How fine dat ass looks."" I am not the type of person to take that sort of thing as a compliment. My sister and I turned around and kept walking. They continued to follow us. Each of them asking if we were single or if we were interested in a ""good time."" We ignored them until we got back to an area where there were more people. Then ring leader asked me to stop one more time. Since there were people around I decided to see what his problem was.

He kept being a general creep and saying very inappropriate things to me and my sister. He got close and acted like he was going to touch me while asking if I had a boyfriend. I did so I finally said yes and to go away. He asked me how big my boyfriend was so I told him he was a little shorter than him but built like a tank. Which was true

A few hours later I went outside to sit in my mom's van (it was right outside the door) to call my boyfriend and tell him about what had happened earlier. We talked about it for a while and I decided to roll the window down about a fourth of the way because it was hot.  After about fifteen minutes one of the guys from the earlier group was standing outside of my mom's van. I pretended not to notice him and put my boyfriend on speaker phone so I could text my mom and ask her to come outside. 

The guy came right outside of the door and asked me to roll the window down. My boyfriend stayed quiet at that point. I said no and asked what he wanted. He said we was having a party upstairs and asked if I wanted to come up and drink a little. I told him I was only fifteen. He looked surprised

She went inside and I continued my phone conversation eventually forgetting about the guy from earlier. I had got out of my mom's van and started walking in a little circle around the pool. My boyfriend said he needed to do something and would call me back so I sat by the pool and waited for him to call me. Wouldn't you know it the same guy was walking around as well. He was carrying a trash bag and watching me as he walked to the dumpster and put the bag in it. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. For the first time I was alone in the dark near this guy who went from rude, to someone who I felt very threatened by. He started to walk towards me when my phone rang. I answered and put my boyfriend on speaker again. The guy ran away when he heard my boyfriends voice. I left him on as I ran back to the motel room and went inside. 

I didn't tell my mom. I guess my stupid young teenage brain thought I was being more responsible and independent by ""handling it myself."" Our last night at the beach my mom, the kiosk was probably a three or four minute walk from the car going at a normal pace. 

I can faintly see my mom at the kiosk talking to who I assumed to be an employee. The car was starting to get extremely hot and I had a snow cone I didn't want to melt so fast. I opened my door even though I wasn't supposed to

He asked me what I was eating and I didn't want my sisters to panic so I acted like it was okay. I said a snow cone. He came a little closer and asked if they were good and tried to explain that he had a daughter a little younger than me and he didn't know if she would like them but they looked like something she would like. I was still scared but just said ""Go get her one then."" He came closer again and asked what flavor it was. I started to panic because he was getting close enough that he could have touched the vehicle door but not me if his arms were stretched out. I didn't answer him because I was scared into silence.  He smiled at me like a starving lion would smile at a limping gazelle. I felt like I knew exactly what was going to happen. In my head I could see him grabbing me and pulling me into the bushes near by and running away with me. Just as he took a step forward that would have gave him enough room to touch me I heard my mom yell ""What the fuck are you doing near my daughter?!"" He looked stunned for a second and in that second my mom was within inches of the car. The man started to back away stammering. She yelled ""You son of a bitch get away from my fucking kids NOW!"" as she came around to my side of the car. He ran away. 

Eventually the man from the kiosk found my moms keys and we left. After we left I got a serious talking to about not keeping things from my mom and listening to her when she makes a rule. It still freaks me out when I think about what would have happened if my mom had not noticed him near me. The time span of me opening the car door and her showing back up yelling was probably only ten minutes,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_1gyy5v

It was located next to the bathrooms. I spent a couple of minutes there and from my peripheral vision I saw a glimpse of man standing behind the bathroom door. I thought nothing of it. Until I looked closer and notice that the man behind the door had his hand in his pants and was staring at me. My mom came to check up on me and I told her about the man in the restroom but as soon as she turned around he closed the door and my mom left. I was starting to get creeped out but continued to play games. Then the door opened up again. He continued doing what he was doing but this time he had took his penis out. This time I decided to leave and went outside. There was a bench outside located in front of the laundromat. Behind the bench were these large windows and you could see the seats inside the laundromat. The man that was in the restroom saw me leave and sat in the seats inside the laundromat. He had a newspaper in his hand and put it on his lap. I was thought he was going to read it but he then proceeded to take out his penis again and start to masturbate. I turned around because I did not want to watch what he was doing. Then I heard a tapping on the window and turned to see him trying to call my attention. I was very scared and decided to move somewhere else. I then saw him get up and I was terrified at this moment. He got in his car and continued to masturbate. He then tried to call me over and I don't know why but I decided to go up to him. He told me to get in his car but I knew better and was starting to walk away when he said it in a more forceful tone. I was just standing there scared not knowing what to do. My mom then came out to look for me and told me not to talk to strangers. When the man saw my mom he left immediately. My mom did not notice what was going on and just told me not to play on the parking lot. I am pretty sure if my mom would not have came out when she did I would most likely not have seen her or the rest of my family ever again. To this day I refuse to go to anymore laundromats.

Amanda and I wanted to look in the toy section and my mom and aunt went to look at clothes. I remember we were looking at Easy Bake Ovens. He must have heard me say her name because this guy comes up and says “Amanda?” and my cousin obviously doesn’t know who this guy is. He’s like “remember me; we met at Wal-Mart when you were with your mom getting glasses.”(She has glasses) Amanda says “no, my names john and my kitten scratched my contact lens that’s why I was there too” Thankfully, my cousin realizes what is going on and we walk away and he’s following. So we start running and find my mom and aunt. We tell them about it and they say that we will notify security when we get to the registers but for now just stay by them. The guy ends up walking past all of us, but does not make eye contact or even acknowledge our parents. This is weird, because if he met my aunt and cousin, then he would have acknowledged my aunt. He looks straight at me and my cousin and walks past us. We go to check out and he is walking outside. We tell the security guard and he asks if we want walked out. My mom declines for some reason, I’m not sure why.  
So as we are walking out he was already at his car and he had a bag with something he just purchased. He throws it in his car and walks back in. I always thought he walked back in to lurk other children. He was obviously a creep.

 I had always lived in a small sort of country town, we'd just talk some before the school bus came. Well one day during Christmas break he knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to come hang out and play in the snow. (I think he might have had some sort of mental problem because he always acted strangely childish).

 It was starting to get dark out (my parents never minded because we'd always stay in the tiny apartment complex as long as I checked in every hour or so.) We were walking in the snow and he started to talk about things that struck me as weird. (Also, sorry I'm not good at storytelling and this is sort of important, and the high school and middle school kids shared the bus.) He was saying how sometimes girls would walk out of the bathroom and he'd grab their crotches and they'd moan, then he said how badly he wanted to lose his virginity but was Christian so he'd have to wait until he was married. I ignored all of this, hoping to stray from the subject. At this time we were behind some of the apartments and he asked me if I wanted him to grab my crotch, I said no and told him I didn't want to talk about this, but he rushed at me and put all of his weight on me to press me against a wall, and that's when I began screaming as loud as I could. That made him run and I ran to my house (with thank god was only about 30-40 feet away.)

Working in a public library, or the occasional explosive outburst. But nothing quite like what happened today.

I was in the stacks, but I assume it's just a patron in one of the other aisles. I grab my next stack of books and walk down to the shelf - at this point I'm pretty much in the corner of the library, though there is one shelf between me and the wall and a little walkway for safety purposes. I start putting the books away when out of the corner I see...

It's not someone looking for a book and we happen to catch eyes - this guy is staring at me intently. It is, one of the first things we're told when we're hired is that if we ever feel the slightest bit uncomfortable because of a patron, we're to immediately grab one of our co-workers, preferably someone senior to us. But I figured, ""Hey, this is definitely weird but I only have a few books left so I might as well finish up.""

I keep putting items away and only have one or two left when I notice - again in my peripheral vision - the guy has come over to my aisle. I glance his way and then proceed to have a little conversation with myself:

""Huh
""No
""Wait
""Oh shit

That's right - dude was standing in the aisle with his pants down

Did I mention he still was still *staring straight at my face*?

I pretty much grew up as an only child in northern Michigan. I have an older sister who is eleven years older than me who moved off to college as soon as possible. Because of this I was always extremely close to my parents

We started off as casual players but through the years and the game's expansions we quickly advanced. By the time I was 17 I was playing constantly. It was extremely hard for me to maintain an active social life and because of this I had never had a boyfriend before. The three of us decided to apply to the highest ranked raiding guild on the server we played. That's when I met my ex and the trouble really began. Within a few weeks the raid leader had quickly taken a liking to me and not wanting to upset him

I've always kept myself in decent shape and would consider myself to be fairly decent looking. He only had one picture on his myspace however and it was extremely dark and blurry. It raised a red flag that I quickly dismissed. From his myspace I learned that his name was Kurt and he was ten years older than myself, he told me he loved me and I was ecstatic to finally have someone. The relationship had always been verbally abusive, if I didn't send him multiple nude pictures or videos throughout the day he would lose his mind and tell me how fucking worthless I am. He would often remind me that I wasn't pretty enough or smart enough to find someone else that would love me, still I stayed.

Three months after hiding our relationship my parents found out. They did whatever they could to keep us apart, and threatening to delete my Everquest subscription. In the end they inevitably failed and being the foolish young girl I was, I fell even more in love with Kurt. Through the next couple months my mother had actually began to take a liking to him, he was extremely charismatic and could fool anyone. He convinced me to move to Tennessee to be with him, (admittedly I was excited about this idea.) in August of 2009 (by this time I was 18) I met him for the very first time. My parents were there to help move me into my apartment, (they were somewhat wealthy and agreed to pay for the first three months as long as I got a job and finished beauty school as soon as possible.

Almost immediately after my parents left to go back home to Michigan things started going horribly wrong. The very first night I was there I cried because it finally hit me, anything he could hit to try to hurt himself. He would tell me how worthless he felt for making me cry. 

A week later I started beauty school located just down the road from my apartment

He wrote me up a schedule I had to follow daily. I could go to beauty school but I had to be home within twenty minutes of the school closing. I was no longer allowed to go out by myself and going out to lunch with my two new friends was strictly forbidden. He began monitoring my cell phone and only allowed me to talk to my parents when he was around

A week later, kicking me in the stomach, in the legs, everywhere but my face. I heard him grab my cell phone and my car keys and put them in his pocket. I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up and was found my cell phone laying next to him, my car keys no where in site. I grabbed my phone and quickly left the apartment, making sure to make as little noise as possible. Once outside I called my mom and told her everything that had been happening. My father had been in the hospital the day before for a major surgery and my mother was already exhausted. She was also hysterical.

She told me that she was going to call Kurt's father and tell him to get the fuck out of my apartment and remove all of his shit before she called the police. (No, he began screaming and throwing furniture around (picture a blonde, slightly gay looking hulk.). He viciously grabbed me by my hair and asked me how I could do this to him. I quickly brought my right arm up and elbowed him as hard as I could in the nose. I  grabbed my purse and my keys that were on the counter, while my back was turned he grabbed a knife and tried to stab me, I effectively dodged him and kicked his arm hard enough he dropped the knife. I made my way out the door and was at the very top of the stairs leading up to our apartment when he grabbed the hood of my sweatshirt and kicked me as hard as he could down the stairs.

I was on my feet (ignoring the pain throbbing throughout my entire body.) as fast as humanly possible. I made my way to my car only a few feet away and once inside I looked back, she was more than willing to offer me a place to stay.

Two days later my parents showed up, but I knew the kind of connections Kurt had and I was worried what would happen if he ever found me or my parents. 

Before the bashing starts in on my parents, I however was just too stupid to listen.

TL;DR? Moved states away to be with my then boyfriend who ended up beating the hell out of me. Also

This is also a well known area for havinga high cost I living and the neighborhood I love is only really gets the occasional weed smoker. Well i have a fairly typical family except that My brother is adopted and special needs (seizures and developmentally delayed) but is relatively high functioning so he hangs out with typical kids quite often and is actually quite the ladies man on campus (he's two years younger than me). He's also very trusting and friendly so he makes friends easily.

Now I'm not sure how he met this kid we'll call him ""Tyler"" but he and this kid hit it off pretty well. Tyler was a typical middle school aged boy who was very polite and always nice to my brother. They would go to the movies and get ice cream at the local shopping center about half a mile away. My brother even attended his bar mitzvah and I worked it. 

Although this kid was nice

Finally after two years of this happening and me being gone at college for a year my parents explain to me what happened between him and Tyler.

So apparently they never really had a fight but they had been hangin out at Tyler's house and Tyler thought My brother an easy target so molested him. Needless to say as an older brother I would not mind beating the shit out of this kid and making his life as miserable as its been for my family the last two years.


TL;DR my younger special needs brother was molested by a child child molester. ",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/ywzuc/this_is_the_sickest_thing_to_ever_happen/
1343860848.0,xj4x1,He followed me there,Nerflet,132,22,34,"I was in the process of applying to university a couple of years ago.  I was overjoyed to receive a notification asking me to come to interview at the Cambridge college of my choice. We didn't have a car or much money but I was determined to find a way

I got off at the train station in a city I'd never been to before, but it wasn't central enough for there to be streetmaps pointing the way, as there are for the other ones (which attract a lot of tourism). My sense of direction's never been great, and I quickly got lost, even though the college was less than a mile from the train station.

I was wandering around the city, it was starting to rain and my backpack with interview clothes and some books I wanted to brush up on was pretty heavy. I was feeling nervous anyway, and I started to get myself worked up pacing the streets and trying to find out where the hell I was going to. It started to rain and I felt close to tears, really wishing my mum had come with me.

That's when the guy turned up. He was maybe in his 40s, and I ignored him and stepped to the side of the road, still obviously studying my Google Maps printout. I looked up after a few minutes and saw that he was still standing there. His expression was sort of vacant and smiley. It weirded me out, but I said nothing, and after a moment I realised that I was standing near a bus stop. I figured he was probably waiting for the bus. That's when he cleared his throat and started talking to me.

""Where are you looking for, because in my experience nobody voluntarily helps out tourists, and that's what I looked like. I looked up, and dumbly told him the name of the Cambridge college I needed to get to. I even tried for a smile, even though I was exhausted and feeling teary. I'm pretty socially awkward so even talking to a random guy has my palms sweating. Something about the slimy way he said 'darling' was off, too, but I figured I was just being paranoid.

""Oh

I thought he meant on the map I was holding, and picked up the bag he was holding and immediately started walking away from me, as if to get me to follow. I stayed where I was, and shook my head, telling him that it was okay, I was sure I would find it - and if not, I'd go to the train station and take a taxi

Once I'd said it, and it was starting to get dark. I was lost in a city I didn't know and as I headed away from him, my heart was beating in my chest a little too quickly. My steps were a bit shaky, too, but I felt instantly better the second I had got some space between us.

I wandered around for another hour and figured I was utterly lost. I start to believe what the guy had said about being miles away from my destination. Figuring it was best if I got to the college before it got past twilight

I kept walking, but this time I'm looking around me for other people in slight terror. Despite the fact that it was a busy city and was the middle of the day there was not much in the way of traffic or people on the streets. I felt a bit sick with nervousness as he wound down the window of the car and gestured for me to come closer. I didn't, standing my ground on the pavement, but I did look in his direction.

""You're still lost?"" he asked

""My son's interviewing at Oxford

I gave him a little smile, but he didn't. I kept walking.

""Hop in

I shook my head quickly, and I knew this guy knew where I was going. I kept walking, picking up my pace, and the gray car followed me, crawling behind.

""Are you sure? It's just around the corner. I'd be happy to give you a lift...""

Again, safe lights of the taxi rank up ahead, and I practically broke into a run down the last stretch of road, threw myself into one of them, and shouted the destination at the driver. He gave me a weird look, and I settled back into the seat, my heart still thudding. Two minutes later

This was about 6 year ago during my freshman year of high school.  For background: I'm in college 6 hours away now

Anyway.  We had 3 horses at the time of this story: My spunky old pony Sargent

I was in charge of feeding the horses every night.  My mom had read an article about feeding your horse smaller meals 4 times a day rather then 2 (my mom is a crazy animal person) to ease their tummies or something.  So at this time I would feed them grain and a pad of hay each at 7:30PM and then a pad of hay each later right before I went to bed.

I should also mention that our property is a bit creepy at night.  There are no street lights on my street so it can be quite dark.  

One night I go down to the barn around 10PM to throw the horses their last pad but when I turn on the barn light I see Candy and John waiting to be fed but no Sargent.  This is odd since Sargent is a little shit fat pony and knows when he hears foot steps that its food time.

I look in the little paddock attached to Candy and Sargent's stall and there's Sargent

A few days go by and nothing happens.  i forget about the whole thing.  Then one night I go out to feed their last pad at 10PM again.  This time I think its kind of weird because the barn light is on. I just figure someone forgot to turn it off earlier and go about my business.  This time both Sargent and Candy are tied up to the fence and John

The next day we buy a couple pad locks and my dad sets up a motion detector light in the barn. we put the pad locks on the horse's stall locks.  

A couple days go by and nothing happens.  I'm watching tv in our living room around 9PM with my mom.  For reference our living room has these glass sliding doors that you can see out to the backyard through, so we go back to the tv.  

Something makes me look again a minute later though and i see this guy (or I think so

they guy sprints off and we call the cops.  The cops can't really do anything though since he's gone.  We never saw the guy again and have had nothing like it happen since.  

My mom worries that he might have been trying to steal the horses. This isn't super uncommon and usually the horses get sold to illegal meat markets.  I dunno though.  He never hurt them and always tied them up inside the stalls.  I think the guy just might have wanted to pet some ponies...

1376237937.0,1k5dzc,The Man in the Doorway,will_fart_on_yourcat,134,26,35,"This happened just 7 hours ago.  

Background:
I'm a male living in a college town slightly off-campus in a duplex.  This town isn't the safest town in America, but they come in and out each day.  Last night there were only me and three others.  I live in the basement of the house in a double room (I'm the only one in this room for the summer) and my floor-mate is on the other side of the basement.  There is a door from the outside that leads to the basement, and only my floor-mate and myself have the key to unlock this door.  My room is small; it can barely fit two twin beds into it and my door is on the opposite side of the room from my bed. 


Anyway

I had woken up at 4:43am with an overwhelming feeling of dread.  It was dark

I jumped out of bed after a few seconds and yelled, the man slowly closed the door, still staring at me with that malicious grin.  I locked the door and heard heavy footsteps walk away very slowly.  This guy wasn't here to rob me, I can tell you that.  The way he shut my door was too calm for any 2-bit thief that just got caught B&amp;E.  

I heard him walk to the basement door

They left and I woke up my floor-mate (a girl) who was asleep throughout the whole ordeal.  She had gotten in a few hours after I fell asleep and she said she locked both the deadbolt and the normal lock.  They were both unlocked.  Well

But the thing that worries me the most is that this guy specifically came into MY house.  I don't know how he got in, they didn't seem very concerned.  What the flying fuck?  I guess their opinions would change if they had seen this man like I had.  His grin was so eerie, and his face was messed up.  But the way he just calmly shut my door as I charged towards him is actually nauseating.

This particular encounter happened roughly two years ago. It was during the summer, so I always ended up closing alone. 

This all happened at about 9:30pm, he comes in, and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blu-rays. Our shelves aren't very tall, so I can see his head poking through. I go back to work, and fifteen minutes later I realize that we're the only two people left in the store, and that he's still in the exact same spot in the blu-ray section, staring at me. I'm a little startled, see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whatever. 

When I finally approach him, but I know he's playing with something at the back of his pants, at waist level. I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon, and that he's planning a hold-up. 

I do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter. I have the strength of a wet noodle, my boss hadn't deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldn't ask me to open it. Because it isn't actually visible, I figured there was a chance he didn't know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirely. 

Finally, directly in front of me, I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank. I looked at it, expecting to see a gun or a knife. Thankfully, it was just his penis. Just an average, semi-hard penis. I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routine. 

The flasher seemed confused by my reaction, goodnight then?"". So I looked up at him, looked back down at his dick and said ""Yeah, whatever."" He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietly. 

I called the cops, because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didn't get him fully hard. Wrong.

Two months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday. The flasher staggers in, see this? What's it say?"" I totally can't help side-eyeing him as I answer ""Draid?"" he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles ""Yeah girl, that's my name! What's yours?"" I lie and say my name is Deborah ""Do you work here a lot, Deb?"" 

At this point, he's kind of shady and like, he said he comes here a lot... so uh... if he ever did anything shady in your store um... like, I wouldn't want you to think it was me... cuz I'm not shady... but my TWIN is..."" I think I actually snorted. ""Alright Draid, whatever. I do work here a fair amount and it's possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didn't make much of an impression."" He seemed disappointed by this, shrugged and said ""Oh... Ok... Well uh that's good..."" and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the store. 

Once more, he'd be discouraged. Sadly, he had more of a ""Challenge: Accepted!"" attitude.

I didn't work night shifts for a good six months after this

He walks in wearing his all-black outfit

He goes back to the same corner as he did the first time, and that my fucking boss STILL hadn't installed security cameras. All he did was give me a ""beatdown stick"" (it's a heavy, wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handle.)

I knew from experience that he'd still be staring at me so I looked up and made eye-contact. I glared at him. Since acting indifferent didn't work

I pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat. I still wanted to scare him, all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it. I started yelling at the screen, like ""HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS""  I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry, and waved the beatdown stick a few times. It took about ten minutes but yeah, he ran out of the store FAST.

It was close to the end of the summer. I was going to start my junior year in two weeks

I was still living with my grandmother. I had decided to live with her full time because she needed help around the house and I worked at the daycare she ran. Artie didn't know where I was living now

I was out walking my dog, I know all the relatively safe places to go, plus I had Maggie with me (a lab-pitbull cross, very bulky dog) I didn't feel in the least bit concerned for my safety.

I was halfway through my walk, but he wasn't looking at me, it looked like his was texting on his phone. I hoped he hadn't noticed me. I quickly turned the corner that would take me back to the street my house was on. I was hoping Artie would turn the opposite way. I wasn't so lucky though, he kept following me, but remained across the street. I quickened my pace, so did he. I walked a little faster, so did he. I broke into a run

I turned towards him and yelled ""Artie, and did the sign for baby.

This needs to be explained. His sister Ivonne has always called me baby in sign language. It was something very special and deeply personal to me. She is the only person allowed to use that sign when referring to me. When Artie used that sign

At this point Artie started to cross the street, she had started growling at Artie when he made a move to come across the street. The closer he got, the more frantic she became. Tugging at the leash, snarling, and overall just being as menacing as she could. That stopped Artie in his tracks. My dog is powerful, I had been tugging on the leash this whole time, trying to get her to move. Artie could see her power and seemed to be put off by it. 

The person in the house nearest to us finally opened their door and asked what was going on

I told them what had happened and they urged me to get a restraining order. They then called my mom and told her the same thing. They took me home and promised to patrol just in case Artie tried to come over. 

I don't know if they really did patrol the neighborhood, if he decides he really wants to do something fucked up to me, the restraining order won't stop him. It's going to take me awhile to feel safe again.

Well

Just over a year ago we had recently moved to my home town. I wasn't quite 18 so nobody wanted to approve my fiancé (who was 22) and I for a house (rental

Then he started talking to this 37 year old guy named John who worked and lived at the caravan park

It was okay for a while. I went with them once and was pretty horrified at the living conditions of this guy. A decrepit old caravan

He smelt really bad

Slowly

Slowly, my fiancé would have between 40 and 100 unread messages on his phone.

We reported to management about this but they couldn't do much. The third time we complained

And then it got even worse. The messages would sometimes even say ""I'm sorry I love you bro"" and even ""joke"" about wanting a blowjob

Then he would say stuff about me (I can't remember exactly what, he was really going to John's and having sex with him.

At night I would hear someone snooping around our van (we had moved into our own caravan by then

This made us all the more desperate to move. So we did finally. He never left us alone. The messages kept coming. My fiancé would occasionally reply and I'll admit

Eventually he got rid of that simcard. We got a home phone and Internet. Forgot about him for a while. And then the desperate creep started messaging my fiancé on Facebook. He would say all this creepy stuff. He threatened that he would get a gun and shoot me and my new kitten (he must have stalked my Facebook or something to now about that). 

We went to the police several times

He would say that ""I have that video of you and Allan having sex

Even looking at his profile now creeps me out. For over a year most of his posts are referring to me or my fiancé. And his fake profile talking to himself about me and my fiancé. He even has the nerve to refer to both of us as speed junkies (which we most certainly are NOT)

He got our home phone number and would call at ridiculous hours and breath then hang up.

A few months into my pregnancy, and he even messaged me admitting to it. And admitting to the phone calls as well. He blocked me shortly after.

At this point

And still the phone calls and messages came. We rang Telstra several times but they said it wasn't a good enough reason to change the number.

And the

He would make comments about the condition of our car and the caravan sitting out the front. Because Telstra

Finally, it turns out they still made it public. So we had to change it a second time. We're finally free from the calls but not the messages and my fiancé refuses to block him.

 Recently I've also found out that he impregnated a 13 year old girl and then sexually abused the resulting little boy. He has also admitted this to several people.

Seriously, breaks in and harms our baby and I? It scares me when I think about it.

TL:DR Fiancé meets creepy 37 year old who becomes obsessed and or falls in love with him and won't leave us the hell alone.

When I was about four (sixteen or so years ago), lush yards. My sister and I were about twelve and four when we moved.

Our next door neighbor, early seventies who had just recently married Kathryn, another woman in her mid sixties. My parents were friendly with Gene and got the notion that Kathryn and Gene had been married before which wasn't a big deal, but plays into the story later.

I always got the creepy vibe from Gene. One of my best friends lived in the house behind me so I often passed Gene's house to visit her house. Gene's favorite hobby was to sit on a lawn chair in his driveway and every time I passed, I was about six, I was walking past and he called me over.

""Come look at these pictures!"" Gene said and I cautiously headed over. It was a thick stack of pictures of children - not child porn or anything, being only six, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward a bit and this is where the story gets really creepy. I avoided Gene as much as I could in this time period and

My sister developed fairly young and by 19 was extremely curvy (this adds to the creepiness factor in a moment). At 12, my sister and I liked to play badminton with the sprinklers spraying us in the backyard. Since we were getting wet, we wore our bikinis to play. It was innocent and fun and we played almost daily.

A few days after we played, the windows could still probably peek over our fence. Sure enough, the door was shut but the windows to the camper were open and Gene was watching us play badminton in our bikinis.

This occurred almost daily when we were playing. Gene would come out, he would, too.

Then one day, when Gene popped his head up over the fence. My older sister had a heart attack, but cautiously walked over to Gene.

""Is this your birdie?"" Gene asked

My sister shook her head. ""That's not our birdie, we had no purple birdies.

""Well,"" Gene said. My sister politely declined then told me we were done playing for the day.

My sister and I instantly knew that Gene watched us play then had gone out, lure us over to his house.

After that

We later on learned that Gene had kissed one of our neighbors on the mouth right in front of her husband and that Kathryn wasn't his second wife

We knew all our neighbors next to our house, etc. Our dogs knew all our neighbors too and were friendly. Goldens could only be called ferocious or mildly intimidating if you count licking someone to near death. Ours were no exception. Lobo on the other hand, was intimidating just by his looks. You didn't want to test him if you didn't know him.

One day Mac goes missing. He's only about 8 months old and never left his mom's side. We search all over, my brothers find a plastic bag with hamburger in it and white residue mixed in, tossed in our bushes near the road, another in bushes by the driveway.  The next day, there's a new bag tossed on our lawn.  Someone's purposely trying to poison our dogs. We think it's probably meant for Lobo. We report it to the police, who say yup we'll file a report. We have no suspect.

My 17 and 19 year old brothers go into full combat mode. It's the south, so whoever drives in must exit the same way after following the roundabout. They position themselves strategically in the heavy under brush across from our freestanding basketball hoop along the street under a streetlight. They want the license plate if this guy gets away. They wait all night in sleeping bags. No one comes. My mom is sick with worry and thinks someone's going to get hurt. Bob, my oldest brother, tells her that's the point.

The next night it's the same setup. The neighbors are aware of the plan. They're outraged at what's happened. I want to be there and whine and cry when they say no. It's not safe. But, I try not to doze off. Around 1:00 am, a car with lights off comes rolling quietly down the street. You can hear the individual gravel pieces crush against concrete slowly under tires and then stop. The car idles low in the night, not moving, assessing the situation. It rolls forward once again and a plastic bag hits the grass. The lights are still off. The shadows of the trees hide the car. I am biting my fingernails to nubs, watching this unfold. My bros want it to drive past their first location to see the plates. (They said later, the plates were duct-taped over.) My brother stands up aiming directly at the driver's window. That car takes off with a screech and a roar in reverse all the way back down the street, trying to get the make of the car. It's so dark. Boys are yelling

This repeats several nights, they floored it through our round about digging a giant donut in the turf. My brother shot at the tire. More for a warning, he said. Car takes off. My bros report the color and make of the car to police. They make a note. The last night the car came back, it idled far up the street and revved the engine. My brothers stood in the street by our house and held up a gun. The car revved, but then backed up and left. My mom had dialed the police, who came an hour after the car left. And that was it. The car didn't come back again after that. We still had a habit of checking our yard for poison. But they didn't come back. TL;DR: Nobody messes with our dogs.",,,,

It was too dark to tell if it was boy or girl, and It was holding a tire iron. I screamed and dropped my phone, and thats when It started beating the hell out of me with the tire iron. I dropped all my stuff and started screaming for help but the streets were deserted. It went on hitting me for a few minutes and when I fell to the floor It started kind of half-heartedly kicking me.  I'm just lying there panicking, all these thoughts running through my head like why? what did i do? They're not even hitting me that hard, why am I not fighting back? What else are they going to do to me? They finally stopped, dropped the tire iron, and ran to a car that had been waiting on a corner across the street the whole time, irrationally chasing after the car as it sped off...They didn't try to rob me or rape me or say anything...they just beat me up for no fucking reason. I stopped to gather all my stuff and my boyfriend called to tell me he was on his way to my house

 For some reason I was more angry than scared and when we talked to the cops they said it sounded like some kind of gang initiation.  When my lease ended about a month later I made sure to move into a building where I'd have my own parking spot.

When I was 16, I had driven up there with friends, but I had never just gone to the mall by myself.  It is 15 miles from where I live, and my mother, being super-protective, had always gone with me if no friends were available.  I never complained, I liked hanging out with my mom

So, and the only thing nearby home at the time was a grocery store and a shit ton of cotton farms, so driving to civilization was a true treat.

It typical teenager style, I'm sure), a short skirt, and heels.  Looking back, I probably looked like a tramp, but when you're young, subtlety is not your strong suit.

I made the 20 minute drive, in the fire lane. A man is sitting in the drivers seat, dark hair, looked hispanic.  I didn't give it too much thought.  There was also a man leaning against the building, smoking.  He had on a white t-shirt, jeans and a blue baseball cap.  Pretty average looking white guy, maybe in his 30's. I made a mental note that he was there

I was feeling pretty fucking invincible that day

I began perusing the non fiction section, through the shelves in the other aisle. He was kind of fidgety and nervous. I kept one eye on him as I browsed.

A minute later he came around to my aisle.  He said

My creeper meter was pinging

He paused a second and kind of looked around. ""So

Creeper meter at code orange, I don't live around here.""

He continued kind of shifting his weight

Now, because, you can see the freeway from the entrance.  There is no way that you could miss it.  His questions don't quite make sense, so it becomes apparent he just wants an excuse to approach me.

I tell him I can't help him, ""Hey, there is some guy approaching customers, he is kinda creeping me out.""

At the same time another employee walks up, he says, ""Was he wearing a blue baseball hat?""

I say

""Because he just ran out the front door."" With that

Then it hits me.  He had been trying to get me outside

The guy employee walked me to my car, and even worse when I had another encounter after this one.

This is something that I had forgotten all about but through reading some of these stories I got reminded of it. Its not terribly bad...but it still creeps me out when I think about it, the kind with the lock on it. So I knocked on the door, no answer. One more knock just to be sure, no answer. I opened it up and there was a man standing inside so I did what any little kid with manners did. ""oh sorry, I didn't hear you say anything"" and started to close the door. The man comes back with ""oh it's okay i'm almost done you can come in here and wait."" heck no...no no no. I backed away and let the door close and waited against the wall. Not 5 seconds later he opens the door and pokes his head out with a creepy smile that gave nicholson a run for his money and said to me ""really...its okay, come on in here."" needless to say I decided that I didn't really have to go anymore so I went and found my mom and dad. I don't know what would have happened if I wen't in there, ~~Maybe he was just being friendly, but~~ to this day even as an adult I still triple check to make sure no one is in the bathroom when I knock.

(FYI- I'm a petite blonde female living in WA Australia) 
I was 18 at the time and had not got my license yet so everyday I would have to catch a bus
I was waiting at the bus stop at the train station before work one morning and a tall guy with glasses came and sat next to me
It's illegal to smoke at the train station but I saw the guy get out a pack of cigs and light up
He told me his name was Dave and sat next to me when the bus came. We talked in a friendly manner and I discovered we caught the same bus and train to and from work.  
So nearly every morning I would arrive at the train station and he would be there waiting for me
This went on for 2 weeks until one day he rocked up at the train station in a car and offered me a lift to work instead, later that day he came into my work around lunch time to (see how I was) then literally bolting out the store when my boss showed up. This is when I thought, this guy is actually a fucking weirdo.

I told my mate about him and she insisted that she take me to work for the next week. About a week and a half later (I had not seen him at the station at all this week) I hopped onto the train, I just tried to be distant but friendly knowing my stop is before his one, as it came to my stop he stood up got off the train with me.
Me: 'Um don't you get off at wellard station?'
Dave: 'Nah i'm meeting a mate today at that pub you told me about'

My stop is the one before the pub

He then got on my bus
'HEY!'
At this point i'm freaking the fuck out. I try put on a brave face and say 
'why did you get off at this stop? I told you the next stop will take you to the pub'. He just starts walking next to me mumbling an answer. I can see my house at this point but don't want him to know where I live so I just say 'my house is down this road' (points to random road)
He then asked if he could come see my house
power walked down the street phone in hand

That was the last time I caught the train from work.

One night I'm sitting in my living room, we never bothered to put up a curtain to cover it. 

So I'm lounging in my favorite chair, using my porch when I'm away or asleep, locking up their bikes/mopeds in my backyard etc. So when I saw, out of the corner of my eye, someone walk past this window, I didn't think much of it. When it happened again, I got a creepy feeling and actually looked out the window, but I shrugged it off and went back to my redditing. 

I was reading a pretty enthralling story, and by the time I realized it wasn't the story giving me the chills but something else, a few minutes had gone by. My first instinct is to not move, so I sit there and pretend to keep reading, but in actuality, I'm petrified. I could feel that something was in the window, and I knew the window was less than a foot from my head. After a few seconds that felt like days

1364921096.0,1bivti,Larry,Chelslaw,132,22,10,"Hi guys. This is my first post to LetsNotMeet

My first memory of Larry is fairly hazy. I was around 3 or 4 at the time and Larry was 20 or 22. My mother had just started taking me and my younger sister to a new church about 45 minutes away from our home. I remember being picked up from behind and swung around someones head, but I was careful not to be without my mom while we were at church.

Larry and my mom became friends through the years after this, right? I remember being disappointed when he didn't have any to give to us. Larry became a friend, a nice guy in my young mind. I forgot about the warning my mother gave me, and she seemed OK with him giving us candy and such. It was when his car broke down, and we started giving him rides to and from church was when the red flags started for me.

Larry lived at the half-way point of our commute to church

When he got in our car
But it was the things he'd say when my mother wasn't around that made me constantly wary and alert around him.

He would tell me that I'd need to start wearing a bra in a few years

I began to avoid him. I was about 8 I think when I realized that the things he said to me were not appropriate for a 25 year old man to say to an 8 year old girl. I was afraid to tell my mother about how uneasy he made me, who lived just outside of the town. We would visit her after church, when Larry couldn't come that week, but he insisted he didn't mind sticking around town for a few hours. 

It got worse at my grandmothers house. My mother and her would be talking in the kitchen while my sister and I would play in the living room. Larry would follow us sometimes, how often they would kiss and the sexy clothes they would wear. He would usually sit next to me on the couch, or block the doorway to the hall and I would have to force my way around him to get back to my mother. 

I would feel sick to my stomach whenever we pulled off the high-way to head into his town. I would fight my sister for the front seat every morning. When he got in I was cold and unresponsive. I thought that if I was rude and unfriendly he would leave me alone. He would call me out in it when we were alone

Things finally came to a head when my great-grandmother died. We went to her house after church a week after the funeral to pick something of hers as a memento. For some reason I still don't understand, and I was petting it on the floor in the kitchen. Larry came in, grabbed a chair placed in front of me and straddled it. If I wanted to get up, I would have to step over his knees; he had me in the corner, between the door to the backyard and the wall. 

He started talking about this girl he liked
He stopped talking and just looked at me. It was quiet for a few minutes before I worked up the nerve to get up and move around him. I had the dog by his collar and put him between Larry and myself. He never said a word

After we had dropped Larry off that night, but she believed me. She told me that she'd keep more of an eye on me and that she'd never let me be alone with him again. She told me to just not talk to him at all. The only problem was that she continued to give him rides. It took me about a year after this to stop going to church all together. My sister did the same soon after, because he started turning his attentions to her.

I guess you could say I go for a certain kind of guy: Tall, driven, intellectual, with a touch of hipster and geek thrown in there. I guess you could say I have high standards. Therefore, I spent a lot of time ""screening"" potential dates with extended messages. chatting or texting before we met in person. I like to believe that because I basically raised myself on the internet, I have a good sixth sense for creeps and weirdos. I call it my FIF: Funny Inner Feeling.

George was everything I seemed to be looking for: he rocked a pompadour and a six o'clock shadow with the ease of Ryan Gosling. His profile was rife with eloquent language, and fantastic music and I was quickly smitten. We started texting, and our texts were similarly full of excellent vocabulary and unique conversation topics.

One chilly fall night I went out with some of my friends to an independent hip hop night and I drank more whiskey sours than I care to admit. While sober walnutwhale may not have been so reckless, right? 

I walked into the pizza place and saw George sitting amidst all the empty tables, I very firmly told him I would be happy to accompany him home, but I was not the sort of woman who fucks on the first date. With a smile that dented his dimples, he told me he respected that and linked his hand with mine.

We practically skipped to his home, I became even more impressed: he lived in the basement of a massive old mansion. He had five roommates, all women and all professional artists. As we tiptoed downstairs to his lair, I was assaulted on all sides by good taste - and that only continued as we hit his ""cave"". Full to the brim of awesome art and interesting artifacts, I found myself even more fascinated with him.

We both curled up on his bed, and then he went in for the first kiss.

And when he pulled away, his features had sharpened, and his grip on me tightened. 

""I'm James Bond

I giggled nervously; suddenly all my alarm bells were going off at once. ""I'm sorry

His eyes narrowed as he regarded me. ""What I'm saying is - don't get too close. Don't get close at all.""

What? We had been having such a great time. I was incredibly confused with this sudden Jekyll and Hyde personality switch. 

""Let's uh... watch your movie."" Attempting to back out of the situation gracefully and thinking perhaps he just showed nervousness strangely, I was on alert, every nerve in my body ready for flight. I'm a big girl: not fat, just tall and Amazonian. George was about the same height and build as me, and I knew I could probably take him if something happened, but I wanted to tactfully extract myself from the situation before that happened.

Backing off seemed like the wrong thing to do. I felt George tense beside me before he jumped on top of me

""George!!"" I protested past his reaching tongue. ""I told you: I'm not going to fuck on the first date!""

My heart was beating a drumline in my chest. I didn't want to become violent in case something even worse happened

""THEN WHY THE FUCK DID YOU COME OVER TO MY HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?! I TOLD YOU

As he bellowed in my face

""Look, she really fucked me over, y'know? I'm broken. I can't... I can't love."" He opened his arms, trying to get me to come to him again.

Something deep within me twinged

Again

""No

""NO

Meekly, George followed me like a kicked puppy.

At the gate, the man I had met earlier that night, all gentleness and handsome aloofness. Then he grabbed both of my arms in a vice grip and attempted to kiss me. I turned my face sideways and he collided with my cheek, and his fingers tightened around my arms so hard that I had bruises the next day.

I am a young woman, but it was easy to tell that he was a bit... off.

At the time, and all about his fascination with laser pointers and listening to the local police with his radio scanner, which he always had on him. 

After a while, and he would continue to send me texts even if I didn't respond. These texts came every night, and typically I would ignore them. I would just talk to him like nothing had happened the next day at work. He never made a big deal about it and neither did I.

I had found out from a coworker of mine that Jeff had been in a sports accident when he was a young child

He began confiding secrets in me that I couldn't even have fathomed about him. His wanted to become a woman, or whether that was simply a personal decision of his. Regardless, I was getting creeped out. However, my sympathy for him outweighed the icky feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I was also told that he suffered from some sort of psychotic disorder

Eventually, and that is where I drew the line. I wanted to keep our 'friendship' within the safe confines of work. So, I made excuses to not see him. I started telling him that I was too busy with school, that I was working a lot more than I actually was. I thought after the first week or two he would back off like any normal person would, but the requests continued for months.

One Friday night, as we would both be going the same way for a few minutes. 

I knew something wasn't right when he turned on his turn signal behind me, and just continued on my way, figuring he would turn in the opposite direction at the next intersection. I was wrong. He was following me, and I had to think quick to lose him. We were heading up the hill, Jeff trailing ever so slightly behind me. The hill was winding, so you could easily lose sight of the person behind you if you weren't careful (or you tried hard enough). So just as I was about to wind the final curve, I flashed my right turn signal (even though I would be continuing forward)

Flash forward a little bit and I'm in my car after dark around 11pm headed to pick up my boyfriend from his job at a coffee shop. He works in a small

Anyways, with a man sitting in the drivers seat. And I notice he's looking right at me. He has crazy eyes, leathery, wrinkled skin, and dark hair. I figure he's probably picking somebody up from work like I am, but I just got a weird feeling about him that I couldn't shake. I figured that it was just me being paranoid or having an over-active imagination, so I tried to forget about it and turned my attention to my phone. But every time I glanced up, and I was getting increasingly freaked out.

At this point we're the only two people in the parking lot. Any stragglers or other cars have vanished. I look in my rearview mirror to see the coffee shop entrance and I see my boyfriend. Wave of relief. I can also see a few of his coworkers leaving and it seems like he's the last one inside. I think 'ok good...he must be almost done and then we can get the fuck out of here and laugh about this'

But here's where it gets scary:

I take my eyes off the rearview mirror to check the car with the sketchy guy in it. But there's no one in the car. Full-on panic mode. I scan around frantically trying to see where he went, and make a show of taking my knife out. In the back of my head there's still a voice saying ""you're overreacting, he's probably just lost or something, there must be a reasonable explanation why he's coming over here"". That voice quickly shut up when he knocked on my window.

""Hey
He gets angry and pounds on my door, he turns on the car and circles the parking lot twice, then he seemed to have left and gone out the exit (my view of the exit was obstructed by the coffee shop).

I finally exhaled. I don't know why I didn't drive to the police station down the road

""Hey hun. Why's your knife out?"" He asks me. I explain the whole situation, and I start the car and head out towards the exit

Only to have the creepy guy, I'm shaking, yelling ""That's him! That's the guy!"". This creep notices a guy with me in the car (My boyfriend's a big metalhead, and scary enough for this guy I guess) and the creep takes off before my boyfriend can get out of the car.

So when I was a kid, which had a road winding through it, and hang out in the river, which was right next to the road.

So a few days before this incident, because we'd have to go around him to get our bikes and leave, and we decided to leave in pairs and all at once, so he couldn't follow us all. The first pair to leave were asked ""hey, want a ride? Come on, get in."" when they got on their bikes. The rest of us glared at him as we got out, and he just smiled.

So anyways, so we could all keep an eye out for him. One of the girls told her mum, who said that she would only be comfortable letting us go back if we had her keeping an eye on us. So, whatever.

She sat in her car, the old man didn't show. Then, he parked in the exact same spot. S's, mum got out of her car and asked him to please move, he stared at her for a minute before driving away.

Even after he left, and I remember looking at the road as it went into the trees, and thinking ""What if he's right around the corner?""

I told S that, me about 15 metres in front of her.

Lo and behold, with him wide awake and grinning like mad- until the car behind me showed up. When it did, he pretty much deflated, and fell back to his ""old man asleep"" pose.

At the time, coat, gloves and beret. You get the idea! My home is a street away from the bus so I had always felt relatively safe going home that late. This is my itinerary home: cross the street twice to get to opposing corner, walk down until the first intersection, turn right and my home is the 5th one to my right. See? Real close, familiar neighborhood, not much to be worried about! There are two unsuccessful clubs right in front of the bus stop. I say unsuccessful because this place has changed vocations so many times in so little time. Cafe, club, it might as well be in the middle of the night... 

So I got off the bus and wanted to go to bed early. I always carry a small travel toothbrush and tiny travel toothpaste tub with me so I decided I would brush my teeth during my 5 min walk home and save those minutes for extra sleep! I hid my toothbrush handle in my hand so it would look like I was eating a lollypop and cheerfully walked home

I’ve still only crossed the street once at this point. The car has made a U turn and is now slowing down right by my side. Unexpected. Shit, well groomed and fit. He’s not wearing his winter coat in his car – only a classy shirt so I noticed. He asks for directions. I have a freaking toothbrush in my mouth! Shit. Shit! I panic slightly. I can’t very well spit out right in front of someone. I close my eyes and force myself to swallow. Dear God, this is embarrassing. I subtly remove the toothbrush and hide it in my pocket, careful not to have it touch the fabric inside. I finally answer his question and start walking again. He keeps up with me and starts asking questions. “Do you live far?” Nah, I live real close by. “Do you want a ride?” I politely decline starting to get wary by now. “You don’t have to be wary of me, I’m not dangerous.” To be honest, if I had been stupid I would have said yes. The guy is handsome. He is friendly. He doesn't give a creep vibe at all, the kind you just want to sit in to feel the rich interior. It is winter and cold outside. The roads are frozen and it’s a bit difficult to walk – you have to be careful not to slip on the ice. I am an insecure scrawny teen who looks like a kid and I am getting this sort of attention from this kind of guy? Sweet! Warning – that’s the thing: I look like a fucking kid. Why is this guy insisting on having me get in his car? 

I’m starting to get nervous and am making up excuses. He offers to have some fun at his place (I only now realize this didn’t mean playing video games - I was pretty innocent for a 16 year old...) but I decline saying my mom is waiting for me. (Half lie. She won’t go to sleep without me in the house but know I sometimes miss my bus and have to catch the later bus – an hour later). He offers a ride again. I tell him it’s not in his way. (When he asked for directions, toothbrush long forgotten in my pocket. He follows me until he can’t then speeds back to the street and tries getting to me on the other side by going around the block. I don’t fully come out of the parking lot and hide in the shadows of a building. I see him look for me, give up and speed the hell out in the opposite direction he had originally inquired about. 

That night, I kept that story close to mind and would pre-dial 911 just in case and keep my knife nearby. I never had to use either one, thankfully. I can’t help but wonder what his intentions were. Rape? Kidnapping? Am I being paranoid? Probably not... 

**Note**: I am not advising to bring knives with you. Actually, not at all what you would consider suspicious or police search-worthy). Also, it could be used against me if I did come into a situation where defense was needed (hey I’m tiny and not all that strong.)

I am a female.

I've never been very good at making friends and having developed several destructive habits at an early age along with being diagnosed with several mental disorders and given a variety of cocktails to help me be ""normal""... My childhood was anything but ""nice"". From middle school through almost all of high school except the very end of it, but because of how I behaved and the actions I took. I can explain more in comments if you're curious.)
Also

In middle school I was in a rough crowd and was spiraling out of control

It's safe to say they were wrong about it in two different ways: one was that my mental state continued to decline to where the voices in my head were now manifesting into shapes and people

Jerry was one of those guys who was a complete sweetheart and he was incredibly charming. Jerry was also a senior and 18 years old. He was sly and devious much like Ted Bundy. At 14 I was still incredibly under developed and I was very thin. I looked even younger than I was (I'm almost 21 and I still look like I'm 16)

You see

So, so when he touched me in places I truly didn't want to be touched, I just went to a happy place in my mind much like I did when I went through a very traumatic experience of being violated when I was in middle school. (I can post that story on here as well, but it will take some time because it honestly still traumatizes me and, hell... my hands are trembling and getting all clammy just trying to think about it).

I never said ""No"" out loud, and for me coming to terms with myself.

I know that none of this may sound very creepy, I found out he had been cheating on me. He claimed he wouldn't have cheated if I had just given him my virginity and had sex with him and that he couldn't help it. Even though I was in that bad of a relationship, it broke my heart and I ended it. (Yes, I kept my virginity intact. That was the one thing I wouldn't let him have.)

A few years later and I'm back at a public school for my Senior year of high school because tl;dr I went to rehab for anorexia and other mental reasons and was inpatient for 2 months and outpatient for several more months. No one was suppose to know, so he moved on and found a more willing girl. I don't mean to sound harsh, but in all reality he wanted sex and he whined for it, begged, and even tried but I had to tell him forcefully to stop.) ...Bad luck with boyfriends, I know. I'm rambling again, forgive me. I haven't slept in some time now and stressed. ...The excessive amounts of coffee probably aren't helping either.

So, agreed. One meeting turned into many and soon I was sneaking out every night to see him. We would make out in his car, and somehow my clothes always managed to come off. I was never in control of the situation and I realize that I am at fault for that. I should have spoken up about how uncomfortable I was and how it didn't feel right to be naked. 
Side note: my body still hasn't really matured at all

One night he got on top of me and he started to insert himself into me. That did it for me. I inwardly flipped the hell out and told him to stop. I asked him what he was doing. His response? ""I don't know."" And then he smiled at me and laid back down beside me.

He was TESTING me to see how far he could get without me saying no

That relationship ended almost the same way the first time we started dating. Except this time he had never broken up with his previous girlfriend

That was when I realized he was a sex addict and a polygamist. 

Fast forward to present day...
I'll be 21 in a couple months. College is wonderful. Friends are wonderful. And my boyfriend of over two years is wonderful and literally the most caring man I've ever met.
A former friend of mine texted me and said that there was something that I probably wanted to see. She told me that I would just have to see for myself. 
What I have seen cannot be unseen. He has a profile on a ""meet-and-fuck""/porno site where he has favorited hundreds of videos. All those videos? ""Barely legal!"" ""Little girl gets blank in the blank"" ""Scared virgin...blank"" ""Daddy's little girl.."" ""

Now, to each their own. But, for ME to look at it and realize that I was his ""type""... it made me ill. 

Once again

**Do NOT be me. Do NOT stay silent. Always speak up when something doesn't feel right. Don't be afraid like I was. And do something else that I never did... tell someone about it. A parent

My mistakes of not speaking up and being to scared to say ""no"" caused me severe emotional trauma. It was so bad that in order to actually lose my virginity

**tl;dr- I started dating a guy(18) at 14

Gender: Female
Setting: Kohl's parking lot

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and figured this would be the place where I submit my first post.

Some backstory:  I've always struggled with my weight growing up

So, I decided to shop at Kohl's since their clothes are typically hit or miss and lately they had been nothing but ""hit"" for me.  It was late, but that didn't bother me since I was getting used to working late at my bookstore job.  I got pretty comfortable being out at night.

As I was walking into the store

I do my shopping and by the time I come out it's about 10PM.  I see that guy again and he's just sort of wandering around the parking lot.  The store doors closed behind me and I start walking straight to my car. I'm keeping an eye on him and I notice that he's stopped wandering around and he's now heading straight for the store

I keep walking and he's getting closer and closer.  The closer he gets, ""Hey mama"".  I look up and see his face.  He's sort of a tall, maybe stocky guy.  He doesn't have a harsh or very distinctive face, just sort of looks like THAT guy who says things out loud to girls all the time as a flirting technique. The guy who's too outgoing and a little too friendly. The kind of guy that talks AT you, not with you.

I analyzed the situation.  He's 15 feet away from me.  He's big, is pretty lame and awkward, not something I think a dangerous person would say.  So, I'm thinking, ""I can outrun this guy if he tries anything, but he's probably just flirting and if I keep walking he'll leave me alone.  He's probably harmless.""  I took one more step and realized how wrong I was.

It was surreal.  Like a split second just exploded into a long period of time in my mind and yet all I visually remember are snapshots.  Within that split second, a distance I thought was enough time for me to react and run away, and the next split second he was standing in front of me.  The next second, his arms were around me and my heart stopped.  It wasn't until that moment that I got rid of that ""invincible"" feeling and I realized just how powerless I can be to someone so much bigger than me.  

The next second, that whole ""I heard someone screaming somewhere and then I realized it was me screaming"" thing... that's actually how I felt.  I was so panicked that this was it, he was taking me to his car, there's no one else in the parking lot, I'm going to be one of those kids who goes missing, that I didn't even realize I was screaming.

Luckily, grabbed my purse, and started running towards his car.  I remember getting up off the ground and with all this adrenaline running through me and now that he was running away and there were two guys there running towards us, I (idiot) started running after him too.  One of the guys started screaming at me, ""Miss, don't run after him!  Don't run after him!""

I started feeling faint

The cops showed up quick and found him a few streets away.  They had to escort me in a police car and take me to him.  When we got to where they found him, I was so certain it wasn't him.  It wasn't until we pulled up close enough for me to see his face that I recognized him.

I started crying when the cops asked me questions about what happened and for whatever reason I said, unfortunate way possible.  I gained back a lot of weight after that.

Well, they couldn't call it kidnapping because he didn't actually get me to the car, but they called it ""aggravated robbery"".  I got the court papers and found out his name was Miguel and his middle name was ""Angel"".  Wow.  And then he went on parole, ran off, and he hasn't been found since.

So when Alan was stuck in the kitchen until one am

There weren’t a lot of streetlights, because his boss paid him in cash once a week, and as head chef (even at a small little kosher place) it was enough to make him nervous, so he’d been coming home in cabs from Flushing on paydays.

I thought he was being overly paranoid

I tugged the zipper of my hoodie up and I wished I’d worn something a little bit more substantial underneath. It was October

I’d just reached the corner of the building when a man called out to me from a van. “Hey

I wanted to just keep walking, it wasn’t exactly a desolate area. I crossed my arms and looked at him, but I kept my weight on the balls of my feet, because I could feel that there was something not completely right about this.

He was sitting in a van with the power turned completely off. No lights on in the car at all

“Come here.”

Yeah, but not nice enough to go traipsing up to a stranger in a dark van in the middle of the night.

“Come on,” he called out again. “You look so cute walking those dogs.”

My blood froze and my hands shook and I walked like a demented speed-walker away from his truck.

How did he know I had dogs? 

 “Hey

I’d walked them well over five hours ago.

A car door slammed

“Come here.”

I could run back to my apartment

“I have something to show you.”

The bodega was a straight shot

I looked desperately for anyone who might help

I started running. My ballet flats slipped against the sidewalk and I nearly turned my ankle

I realized he wasn’t following me when I heard a car engine start behind me and I whipped my head around. He was gone. I even felt a little stupid, but that didn’t make him dangerous.

Then I saw his van pull onto the street. He was driving the wrong way

I sprinted like I was back in high school track, ugly white van with fading paint that looked like something you would buy at a car lot especially created for creepy people with bad intentions.

I felt a huge stitch in my side as I neared the bodega and Queens Boulevard

He left the van in the middle of the street and stepped out.

I ran into the bodega

Sure, and the bodega guy just shook his head furiously at me for making his night more difficult.

I called 911

Before I’d even finished the call

The bodega man was pissed I’d brought my drama to his business, and then we both waited for the cops, which took nearly half an hour.

The cops were about as nice as NYPD cops get

We moved a couple of weeks later – we’d already put the money down on another apartment – but I never saw him again.

I didn't hear him approach, and saw a short, but very overweight man standing at my shoulder, maybe two feet away. Probably in his forties or so. He was staring at me expectantly, and I thought maybe he wanted to look at something I was blocking.

I mumbled a ""sorry"" (never been very socially comfortable

""Nah, rather cheerily. ""You're into games?""

I was, and was actually pretty mundane until he started talking about taking vacations, where I'd been and where he'd been. First major red flag came up at this point-

I gave the socially accepted

""I really think that people secretly love watching other people hurt themselves really badly. Like, guts and stuff. It's the best.""

The whole time he's going through this speech, while he's getting into it, he's advancing on me. I backed away, and ended up bumping into the aisle wall-thing. I remember feeling the display hooks hitting me in the back and just being like oh, fuck.

""So I keep going on the ski trips, too - you ever see that?""

I'm glancing around

""So what do you think? Don't you just love it?""

Well

For starters, and guess who's on my walkway?

It's the guy who, all I could really do was look up at him with a look that screamed ""Oh man, you are *seriously* in my yard right now, aren't you?"". My course of action, a slow shake of my head and resuming my tinkering. I am not giving this guy the time of day. Nope. Noooope. Nope.

""Hellooooo?"" He waved his hand close to my face. Oh gawd, hey! Sorry I exposed myself on your back porch! Friends?* Whatever.

""Yes?"" Yeah

Him: ""What's up?""

Me: ""The usual.""

............

Him: ""How's your day?""

Me: ""Not much of a day

Him: ""Hahahahaha! Cool! Who ya' texting?""

If this was most anyone else in the world, and I'm done being nice to perverts and creeps. So, mug down, I give him a death-look from the stoop.

Me: ""Okay

Him: ""Wha- why?"" He starts getting defensive. Whatever dude.

Me: ""Because, so excuse me if I'm not so friendly anymore, bro.*

Him: ""I thought we were friends!"" He starts to raise him voice at me. 

*Yeah, apparently.

Me: ""Well, I'd have to say no."" Do you I have to remind him of what he did? Seriously? Could this get any more terrible? At this point, I'm starting to shake a little. I couldn't tell if it was because I was angry or nervous or what, but I wanted this idiot away from me.

He then loomed over me and said ""You need to STOP!"" So I stand up, and looked him straight in the eye. 

""Seriously

I FEEL HIM BEHIND ME AS I REACH MY DOOR. He's barely an inch away, for fear he'll follow me in or something. For a quick second, I pondered slamming the screen door into him face, if I could only manage it.

""Get off my porch!"" I said, thanks to a past medical run-in that resulted in damaged vocal cords.

""Why are you being such a bitch???"" he bellowed angrily. Now I knew that I was shaking from nervousness, whenever we had previously interacted.

I was nanoseconds away from pushing him backwards so that he would take a tumble down those concrete steps. 

""Dude

""Hey! What's going on, who had come out of his house and was now viewing the two of us.

""This guy bothering you?"" Mr. G asks in an abnormally gruff voice.

""I just came over to-"" the guy starts out before I interrupt.

""Yes

""Boy....."" Mr. G started out before being interrupted with a ""WHATEVER!"" as the offender suddenly turns and marches off my property and turn down the sidewalk in a huff to wherever.

In my cabin I had my two best friends, and a screen door, now go into the screen door and on either side of you there are, as i said, four bunks, and at the end of the ""cooridor?"" a window. My mom was sleeping in the cabin across the way with my troop leader and the other mom.

Soon we were all asleep but my friend, then at Tara who was across the way, she was awake as well. Since we weren't technically allowed to be awake unless we were using the bathroom we decided to go get my mom who would take us through the trail to go to the bathroom just to let Lisa catch a breather.

By now the fire was basically out and we had my flashlight as our light source. So we bundled up because New England is Freezing at night even if it is spring. As we were getting dressed i put my flashlight into my mouth so i could use both my hands. But out of the corner of my eye i saw a shadow. I thought it was my own and camping was playing tricks on me but i looked anyway.

My scream may have broken all the rules the camp had about curfew. My entire cabin was up

I live on a rough, at least by face, if not by name.

The house I live in is a great big old house, and a small attic. We've got an adjacent garage that was added on much later after the house was built. It connects through the kitchen, separated by a heavy wooden door, with a small screened in porch between the two. (That was obviously the secondary entrance to the house, now blocked by the garage.)
Besides the cellar door in the backyard, pink-nose 95lbs pitt. Our dog was trained by my gf's brother, the dog's previous owner, as a guard/attack dog, as he was a drug dealer and couldn't have people breaking into his house. When we got our own place, he gave us Karma as a house present to keep us safe.

Now.
For a few days, looking around. When she'd let it go, I would, too. But these strange sounds persisted, nearing the point that I began to believe perhaps some sort of racoon was in my attic. But with dog, and flashlight in tow, we turned up empty handed. Dusty
One day in particular, to the bedroom where my gf's AK-47 is kept. I found the dog confronting our refrigerator, and scolded her. (Not realizing she was hearing the sounds beneath.)

That night in bed, we assumed it was a drunk next door, and slept through it. 

I awoke the next morning, heavy thumping in the basement. This is where our laundry appliances are, and sometimes our washer -Which is ancient, but reliable - makes a whud-whud-whud sound when doing the final rinse cycle. I ignored it, thinking my gf may have thrown a load in before work, though I heard Karma growl a few times. She'd been growling at everything it seemed, so I dismissed it. 

About an hour later, who is somehow too much of a baby to ever walk down these rickety basement stairs, stayed at the top, but with her big ol' head poking down, listening. I could hear her sniffing and snorting and letting out little complaints here and there. 

On the wall opposite the laundry appliances is the door that, like a cellar door. I don't know who made this house, it's all wonky.)

To my surprise, where I saw the door had been busted open.

It then occurred to me

I filed a report with the police, other than us. Worse, is that I had been down there fairly regularly doing laundry. He could've hid easily, as the basement has separated areas.

Finally, I think just being in the same building as him was giving my nerves a shock, because no matter where I went, I felt like he was staring at me.  I wrap things up and go to the cashier, and she asks for my CVS card.  Crap! I forgot it at home!  No worries, I can pull it up using my phone number.  I remember being hesitant, but again I just shamed myself for being paranoid and judgmental

 As soon as I gave it to her.... right there in that very line... my phone started to ring.  My mind immediately went ""HOLY SHIT"", WAY too stereotypical, don't be so judgmental, it's probably just your mom calling, etc.""  I scramble to get my phone out of my purse, but as soon as I get it out, the ringing stops. The number is one I don't recognize, but again I think ""oh, right there in the parking lot

At this point, I forget it at this time... Matt.. Mark...Mike?  I very hopefully think ""Oh... it wasn't really that creepy guy in the store.  It is just some guy who called the wrong number,he probably thinks he called a friend of his, cut him a break.""

I had just graduated high school and was working a night shift at the Wal-Mart in the next town over. One day I logged into Facebook and noticed I had a friend request. I got that excitement we all know that we secretly get when we have a friend request and we hope it's not some random e-whore trying to get more friends. I clicked the button and immediately recognized the person as the son of my childhood Girlscout leader. He was a moderately attractive man, and a gorgeous smile. I was curious so I accepted his friend request and we started IMing for a while.

After a week or so, decided I would take my dog with me. My dog is actually the sweetest thing in the world, border collie/golden lab mix, and would never hurt anybody, but she was protective and would bark if we even rough housed at home or if someone made her nervous. I figured she would be good for protection and if she didn't get nervous about this guy, then I didn't have anything to worry about. I hooked Sydney up to her leash and mad the mile trek to the park. By cutting my way through the elementary school and across the large grass lot, Sydney and I made it to the park in less than 10 minutes where I found Mike sitting on one of the swings and walked over to him. I was a little leery at first, and found out we had quite a bit in common. It went well and eventually we parted ways.

The first couple of weeks went by smoothly. We'd meet up before we went to work at night and spend a couple of hours walking or sitting at my house watching television in my room on the nights we had off, I remember how terrible it was.

""What's today's date?"" Mike asked me.

""December 4th."" 

""Then that will be day the you had your first kiss.""

I really wish he hadn't said that

Christmas rolled around and we exchanged gifts and started spending more time together. Then things started getting weird. He was always talking about this girl he really liked. She was 15 (Mike was 22 and I was 18). This is when the red flags started going up. He would always tell me how she gave the best head and how he liked sex and has had sex with so many girls. I felt like he was pressuring me or encouraging me to give myself up to him and that's not what I was looking to do. I'm not so much of a prude

In late January, we were just friends with benefits. I may not have had self-esteem, but I sure had self-respect and I was not going to be one of those girls who got tied up in a relationship where the guy simply didn't want to consider them a couple because he had other girls he would rather be with. He called me one night and I told him that I didn't want to speak to him anymore. I told him I had heard enough about his sexual encounters and that it was creepy that he would even think to tell me of such things. 

""And to think I was just going to ask you to be my girlfriend

""Well then I called you just in time. I don't want to be your girlfriend. Please don't call me anymore.""

A couple of days went by and I hadn't seen him or heard from him. I began spending time with my friend and co-worker, and Jessie was over in the craft department and needed some help cutting fabric. Our small-town Walmart wasn't much for training and I was the only person that night who knew how to do it, so I went over to crafts to help her. We were cutting the fabric when I heard the familiar sound of Mike and his friend Daniel in the toys department nearby, I looked out of the corner of my eye and there he was, watching me. I had told Jessie about the relationship and how strange it had become. After we cut the fabric for the customer and the customer went on her way, I pulled Jessie to the next aisle and told her that Mike was there and that I wanted her to walk me to my car after work. The feeling in the pit of my stomach made me more nervous than ever. There were only a few minutes of work left so I hurried back to my department and finished my work and met Jessie in the back at the time clock. We clocked out and hurried into the parking lot and to our vehicles.

Suddenly I was just seeing Mike everywhere. I thought I was just paranoid, literally, at the dollar store, the grocery store, the movie theater. As his personality quickly soured, I started seeing how unattractive he really was. His big brown eyes started to look like beady, menacing rat's eyes and his smile seemed more sinister and terrifying. The site of him would make me cringe. Then the text messages started.

I should tell you, we were still considered in city limits. To drive past my house, you would have to drive out of town to the first county road, then onto my street, which was kind of like a cul-de-sac. It went straight down and then turn at the end and go back around and meet up with the main road in the middle. My bedroom window in the house faced the elementary school nearby and the street is not in a location that you would just drive by during your daily routes.

That's when I got the first text from him in a couple of weeks, Jackie, what's up?""

It was from Mike. I ignored the message and went about messing around on my computer when my phone dinged at me again

At this point, and went around to make sure the doors were locked. Being that I was working nights and I had only recently woken up, I just went back to my computer and my phone dinged again, ""I see how it is. See you soon.""

I was still seeing him everywhere. He'd be at Walmart every night before he went to work and I would hide myself somewhere so as to avoid him. He would stand in my department and wait for me to return before eventually leaving. I ended up quitting my job and became afraid to even leave my house alone. Jessie had coincidentally quit the day before me and would come to my house to pick me up before we'd head off to hang out.

Valentines day rolled around and I still hadn't completely gotten back on track to my sleep schedule. I was taking a nap in the late morning/early afternoon. When I woke up there was a bouquet of daisies (my favorite flower) on my desk and a puzzle of a penguin (I love penguins and puzzles)

""Mike brought them over. He took them to your room

Feeling even more creeped out, you look so peaceful when you sleep."" I literally had to run to the bathroom and throw up. I couldn't believe he was standing in my room watching me sleep.

Eventually the messages started slowing down before coming to a stop. I didn't run into him anymore. I assumed he had gotten tired of following me with no results. Soon it was as though he had completely disappeared

Last week, figuring it was just the chill of the store, I continued browsing through the different teas. That's when I heard his voice, ""Hey."" I looked over and right next to me, where seconds ago, nobody had been, there was Mike. Staring at me with his devilish eyes. I quickly grabbed a box of tea bags, ""Hi."" and walked off as fast as I could without looking too obvious.

Backstory time.

I live with 3 roommates

We have different work schedules and only a 3 bedroom apartment. So of course the youngest one gets the living room to sleep in. He also has the latest shift coming home at around 3 am. Normally there is one of us home at all times unless we're out so we keep our door unlocked. 

At this particular time two of my roommates were gone for at least the weekend and the other one was expected to be home soon. I remember that I had to park across the parking lot that night because our neighbors were having a party with quite a few people. After a few hours I heard my roommate coming in, I unlocked the door and checked to see if he was alright only to see him sprinting off at an alarming speed. 

It was only then did my roommate ask ""What the FUCK was that??"".... from behind me in the living room.... Chills went up my spine as I realised I almost let some random burglar into my apartment without even knowing it.

I don't know what would have happened if I didn't want to scare my roommate that night and instead had just unlocked the door and let him in. Also the next day our maintenance man said multiple people's apartments had been broken in to and my charger to my GPS had been stolen out of my car... Not the actual GPS... just the charger...

A few years back I tried to sell some dresses online. I put up pictures of me wearing them. They weren't revealing and I had cropped out my head. I was stupid enough to have my phone number on there

The first call was on a Saturday. I was sleeping in


A few days later I get called again. This time there was moaning, a long while. I'm pretty sure the man who called just days earlier was the same guy (in any case this ""Peter"" never called me back) and I'm pretty sure he was looking at the pictures of me in the dresses while he was phone-fapping. Gross. Months go by of me getting sporadic calls in the middle of the night. I generally just didn't answer and had my phone muted by default. My boyfriend once picked up the phone but he hung up immediately.


Ok now fast forward a few months later when the phone calls had died down a bit. Hadn't gotten one in weeks when all of a sudden, but I had to go to class so I put it in the back of my mind.


I get to class and notice that I don't know anyone there. I'm also a bit late so I just sit at the very end of a row of seats, sitting in a slumped position. I think nothing of it, maybe he's just awkward. During the class I saw from the corner of my eye that he was looking at me, and I don't mean glancing. He had his head turned completely to the side and staring directly at my face and what I was writing down. This started to bug the crap out of me so at some point I just looked straight at him and said ""hm?"", thinking he might want to ask me something but is too shy to do so. He turns bright red, stammers a bit and then gives me a creepy smile and asks ""um.. what were those three points again?"". The three points being the three main points of the class. These points were also on the slide, on the huge screen right in front of him. I tell him as much (""look in front of you


Ok now I'm not a paranoid person. But the missed call that morning, Peter wasn't there yet, and hope that's the end of it. He walks in, sits right besides me and stares at me some more. Super. After class I immediately called up a friend and had lunch with a bunch of other people because I was really freaked out at this point.


That week I got several more of the creeper-calls, seeing as how entire rows were still empty), walked past them and sat at the very end, next to the wall. I figured he would never ask five people to get up, like I just did, just to sit next to me. I constantly check over my shoulder when I see Peter walk in. He looks around the classroom until he finds me, then starts to walk down the stairs towards my row, we don't want to get up again, sees no other seats near me and walks out. I mean


This could all be a coincidence. Peter could just have been some shy

A couple of years ago I was a freelance writer and was doing ANY other spare job I could find to supplement my incredibly inconsistent income. As a fairly talented photographer, being an attractive young lady with the big camera made me a perfect target for drunk creeps and girls looking for fights... but those are stories for other times.

The company I worked for set up photobooths on the weekends at some of the more ""swanky"" clubs. Camera on a tripod, but there was a lot of time in between rushes of drunk people so I was always playing around on my phone.

On this particular night I was working at one of the more ""ghetto"" clubs - there was at least two fights a night and people liked to have sex in the bathrooms. I had been playing around on my (brand new) iPhone 4s when a rush of people assaulted the photobooth. I didn't have pockets on my dress

A big

""Did you see who took my phone? Did you see?"" I asked the girl. She shook her head, and the big bossy girl slipped off to her weaselly boyfriend. 

I KNEW it had been the two of them. He had commented on my phone earlier that night ""Oh

But no luck. He wasn't allowed to look down her breasts and she wasn't cooperating anyway. The club security just shrugged it off as ""oh well"". I was filled with blind rage and adrenaline. I had just spent $600 of my own money on that goddamn phone. As a writer

Then, staring him down. He only came up to the bottom of my chin, so I put on my best nonplussed face and stood there until the security guard grabbed him. In reality, my heart was pounding. I was scared. A lot of these people were gang members and shootings within this crowd were not uncommon. But I went back to work, tucking it back in my mind as valuable information (see: guilty behavior)

The moment I got home (at around 3am), and then... out of my city. Waaaay out of my city. An hour south. Dammit.

The cops told me to go within a block of where my phone was and then call them to come intervene. Fine. We did this once at 4am and two young cops showed up. They were very helpful but said they couldn't knock on doors (it was an apartment complex) until at least 9am

Sigh.

Home for a quick nap

At 9am on the dot I called the cops again and up rolled an older gentleman. I'm not going to lie - he was *gorgeous*. Total ex military silver fox - cropped grey hair and piercing blue eyes. He immediately started joking and flirting with me - it was flattering

I sing him my ringtone (the chocobo theme!) and he decides that he is going to start calling my number as he knocks on doors of the apartment complex to see if it rings from within. I wait in the parking lot. After a few minutes

""But... did you get my phone?"" I ask

""Oh... you mean this?"" He asks. Suddenly he's smirking and he pulls my phone from his front pocket and holds it out to me. I snatch it and in complete reflex from this harrowing experience I give him a hug. 

""Oh, I wish I got payment like this more often..."" he purred into my hair. 

Ummm. Okay.

So I disentangle myself from mister cop and thank him

I head for my car and follow him to another parking lot. He opens his door and sits in his driver's seat

""Oof

I giggled nervously. ""So

""We'll get to that in a minute. Have you ever been on a motorcycle? You'd look amazing on the back of mine.""

I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. It was such a midlife crisis thing for him to say. ""Not since college

Things went on like this for awhile. He kept deterring the conversation to flirty, even for things not relating to the case *wink*) I thought it was finally time to part ways. Nope. 

""I sure could go for another one of those hugs.""

Whatever, etc. I forget about it. It wasn't that weird - people persistently hit on me pretty frequently.

But then the calls began. Always from a blocked number

I'm a very public internet personality. I have a pretty well known blog. So then the weird anonymous blog comments start. Really
""Your lips are so perfect

Things like that. Again

But then they become more specific.
""I'd fuck you with my night stick.""
""How do you feel about older cock? I could treat you right.""

AND IT ALL MAKES SENSE. Aggressive silver fox has been bizarrely stalking me. Finally, hoping that will be the end of it.

A few calls later where he continues to ask me out (""c'mon, and then laughs nervously. ""You have a blog? Cool! I'll have to look it up.""

I woke up late one night to my phone ringing. I looked at my clock and wondered who would be calling me at 4 in the morning. The caller ID said it was a private number. Thinking that is was some automated call, until these calls started to come more often. It made me uneasy, but they were so rare, I didn't think too much of it.

During my freshmen year of college, that whoever this was, it definitely wasn't an automated call or anything. 

They started to get adamant. Like, needs to leave me the fuck alone. So, I finally answer. The first thing I notice is loud rap music in the background. 

""Hello

No response

""Please stop calling me. I think you have the wrong number.""

I hear menacing laughter and incoherent mumbling. Even though I couldn't understand what he was saying
  
""Look
And I hung up. 

I'm thinking this guy is probably drunk or on something because I couldn't understand a word he said. It was just the way he said them. It really creeped me out. I got a gut feeling that this guy was someone I never wanted to meet in person. Ever. And that's when I began to wonder if I had a stalker on my hands. I really became paranoid about it. The calls continued for months. They were so frequent that I ended up turning my phone off at night so I could sleep. I never thought about calling the police because I didn't have a number to go by...I was always really aware of my surroundings from that point on though. Being on the third floor of an apartment helped

During Christmas break that year, and just relax. But early one morning, I get a call from the private number again. Except this time, it wasn't 4 a.m. but around 8 or 9. I answer ready to go off on this guy. 

""Who the hell is this? You have the wrong number. Leave me alone.""

Then I hear a deep male voice respond in a demanding way
""Are you going to meet me?""

This was the only coherent thing I've ever heard from this guy. He sounded like your typical thug, in shock, I respond.

""No. I don't know you.""

In the most menacing voice I've ever heard
""I know where you live. Be there soon."" *click*

This is the part where I flip the fuck out. I'm in full out panic mode. I rush to my parent's room and wake them up. I'm on the verge of tears and I tell them what happened. Obviously, is up immediately and grabs his gun from under the bed. He is on full alert, and starts keeping an eye out for mysterious cars driving around. I was petrified the whole day and sleep definitely wasn't going to happen.

Sorry to be painfully anti-climactic, I would call my phone company to see if they could trace his number and report him to the police. But, the calls just stopped after that. I've haven't gotten a call from him since. I've always wondered if it was someone just messing with me, but from the way he said ""be there soon."" didn't sound like messing. He sounded menacing and threatening. My gut told me I was in trouble. Nothing came of it though. Everything just....stopped.

I can't help but wonder if he thought he was calling someone else. Someone he knew. He was going to go over to that person's house and something bad was going to go down by the way he sounded. I really hope it wasn't some other girl who just happened to sound like me. If it was

 We were closing up the place when I noticed a small, I could see a guy in his late thirties get out of the truck and pace from one side of it to the other. I thought that was odd, but I wasn't alone and we still had regulars outside talking by their cars, so I sort of shrugged it off and continued to sweep. 


About 20 minutes later, the owner was there and asked him, ""Can I help you?"" He responded with something along the lines of, ""Don't even worry about it. Frank's coming. I'm meeting Frank here."" The owner, Bruce, told him ""Sorry buddy. We're closed."" He kind of stared at him with a confused expression and stumbled back out. His walk, talk, high or both. Bruce asked my coworkers and I if he had been in the restaurant that night


Once he stumbled back out, who blew him off. He then tried to open our doors again with no success  and walked out into the parking lot towards Bruce's car, which was not parked close to his truck. 


 He started looking through Bruce's car windows and banging on his window, trying to get into our restaurant after telling him we were closed.

He also thought he was in a city 40 minutes away from where he actually was and that he worked next door to us even though he did not. He had a hospital bracelet around his wrist and told the police that he had just gotten out of the hospital for a problem with his liver enzymes. I'm not sure if he was doped up on medicine or something else, but it was clear that he was not coherent.

 This is the first year I have ever been away from home; I recently graduated high school and moved away to college. It was just another day, he was a pretty average looking guy, but there was something about his demeanor that emanated an overall bad-creeper-up to no good kind of vibe. 

He began to make small talk with me which was fine until he said one seemingly innocent remark that haunted me for the rest of the day: I've seen you around a few times. I was taken aback. I have never seen this guy around campus nor my apartment complex, where he watched my every move never lifting his stare. I told my roommates about what happened, and the incident was forgotten. 
      
  

About a month later as I was coming back home from dinner with my roommates I noticed the very same guy lurking in the same place where I had my first encounter from him. He was hidden partially by shadows since my apartment complex is a piece of shit and won't install proper lighting under stairways or anywhere for that matter. Instantly I hastened my pace and grabbed my keys from my purse hurrying my roommates the entire time joking around that we were going to miss our favorite TV show (which was true) and quickly I locked the door behind us. One of my roommates noticed him lurking around and mentioned that perhaps he was the one responsible for the series of bike thefts that had been going on lately. It was then that I mentioned that was the same guy from a month earlier. We called the police and that was that
        
 

 I thought that was the end of that. I was very wrong. About a month and a half later I left my apartment with a friend to go throw out the trash while my roommate stayed back cleaning up the kitchen. My stomach dropped with the first step I took out the door. There he was standing in the same spot as usual

I was so relieved when my roommate opened the door and let us in
       
  

I am so thankful that the final encounter did not escalate any farther. I often wonder what would have happened if my roommate was back in her room. What would he have done then?

I tend to have an open mind about eccentric people, and in the start there was nothing to suggest this guy would be any different. 

I first talked to him in the afternoon of the first day. There were some introductory activities where we were placed in small groups and were to play name-games and such in order to get to know each other. I presented myself, like you are. I found out he was a master chess player and thought that was kind of cool, and I told him a little about myself, too. He was really keen on finding out my home address for some reason, but I didn't think much of it. 

I think my first mistake was that I decided to go outside and have a cigarette with him. Damn, but when you're nervous and looking for an opportunity to have some casual conversation with new people, it's just so practical to have something simple like that in common. It was near impossible to have a conversation with this guy though. He just couldn't keep track of what he was saying, and he kept echoing my words for some reason. And he really had a strange smell to him - a thick, sour odor that wasn't really sweat, or dirt, or smoke

I've since spoken to the old, too, and asked him about it, but the conversation trailed off. 

Our little group had all exchanged phone numbers and e-mail addresses, he said. I said I didn't know what he was talking about and asked him to call the IT-department instead. ""No, I can't do that, they don't want me at their university so they rewired my account, just to mock me!"".

The next day I tried to avoid him, full of books that kept falling out on the floor. I felt sorry for the awkward guy so I didn't really tell him to fuck off at first, but I really started to feel uncomfortable when he put his hand high up on my thigh during a lecture. ""Please don't touch me"", I said as politely as I could, and saw some strange kind of flicker of electricity passing through his eyes. 

At the time, so I could stay up and browse the internet for a good hourly salary. I had the night shift, so that day I just passed by my little student room quickly, picked up my stuff and left for work. 

I got his first text message just as I got on the bus to work. It wasn't much, I got that little text message saying I had voicemail, and that it was a 20 minute long voicemail. Then a text message again. ""I'm outside your place, can we meet?"". And then a phone call. And another. And another. And another. I let each one go to voicemail, and each one led to a 20-minute long recording that I didn't dare listen to.

I was a bit shook up but the girl I was working for was cool about it, turned off my phone and helped her get to bed. 

After she was OK I sat down to check my mail. I already had three new e-mails. All from him. They were short and practically incomprehensible, and ""lose everything like Romeo and Juliet"", anger for me having ""not opened the door"" and ""turned off my phone"". No real threats, though, apart from him saying that he would kill himself if he couldn't be with me. Which most definitely was serious enough. 

I didn't do much that night apart from sitting in front of my computer, so I figured he had gone to sleep and had the guts to finally listen to my voicemail.

They were filled with the same type of ramblings, animal-like yells and tiny little whimpers. I swear that everyone I let listen to these recordings would go ashen and say it was the creepiest thing they ever heard.  

I realized I had to do something but didn't really know if I should call the police, hoping she could tell me what to say or do.

This amazing woman sent me a response at 7 am, so I went to stay over at a friends house. Later that day I got an email from the psychiatrist telling me that the guy was ill and had been taken to the hospital, all was OK and I could go back to school the next day. 

I went back home and saw that the electric code-lock had been bashed up with some sort of a blunt object

I found out later that the psychiatrist had managed to pull a few strings with the university administration so that the start of his program would be postponed for a year. They couldn't kick him out, but they got him to agree on that he'd have to wait until he was feeling better.

I had almost forgotten about him until I saw him on campus a year later. I spotted him from miles away and think I managed to sneak off track before he saw me. And I got one last  e-mail

But what really freaked me out was that I later heard that the psychiatrist had called for an emergency meeting with all of the students in the grade below me. I only heard this as rumors, and they were to contact her if they heard anything from him at all.

I moved out from my little apartment soon thereafter. It just didn't feel OK to stay. And I deleted my Facebook. And I still look around me before I sit down in the bus

This happened about 2 years back in 2011, Go Bus etc to go home on weekends/holidays. 

I usually left in the afternoon but this particular Friday, I had never thought much of it before.

As I was boarding the bus

After adjusting into his seat, he would not make eye contact with me but was sitting uncomfortably close. Eventually his questions got too personal, and after a draining week, I really didn't want to muster the energy to keep this conversation going. Slowly, I turned to face the window which was entirely darkness, given the occasional streetlight and other vehicles on the road (we hadn't made it to the main highway yet, so we were still commuting through the smaller towns picking up passengers). He made no further attempts to talk but the light above our seat was on, I would catch his reflection and every time he was facing me. 

I soon placed him further and further in my mind and let the the flow of Yiruma's melodies drift me off to sleep. Biggest fucking mistake. I woke up from a warm moist feeling on my left thigh. I was still groggy, and this motherfucker had his grimy hand on my upper inner left thigh. I was wearing leggings too, so he copped a nice long feel that sick fuck. At this point, I had slept for quite some time (the commute to the city was a couple of hrs) and the bus had filled up to a fair amount of people, particularly for this time of night. This sneaky dirtbag had taken out his laptop, and rested it on his leg to conceal the fact that his right hand was placed on my thigh. Judging from the warmth and moistness of that spot on my thigh, it made sick to know how long his hand must have been there. As soon as it had occurred to him that I was awake and had turned my head to face him, all the while maintaining eye contact with me. 

My initial reaction was confusion, but that was quickly overcome by anger. I gathered my stuff, stood up, and said, ""I don't know what you were trying to do, but don't you ever fucking touch me again."" I didn't sound as angry as I had hoped, but it was enough to garner attention from other passengers and to get my point across. The moment that I had started to get up and open my mouth, I didn't care

As soon as I had taken place in my new seat (I sat on the opposite side, completely disappeared. I felt helpless and scared at the thought of what he had already done and thought about doing if I had kept sleeping. As soon as we arrived at the terminal downtown, I rushed to the subway station below and felt a bit of relief knowing that I would be home soon. My heart instantly skipped a beat when I looked across to the other side, and saw him standing there in his overcoat, with his laptop bag to the side and the same solemn expression painted on his face, just looking in my direction. I turned away until my subway train finally came and I hopped on. 

Sorry for the wall of text

TLDR; Creepy guy in large overcoat sat next to me on empty bus, spent rest of way home in fear.

I had a few sips before going off to the bathroom. When I was in the bathroom, I started feeling really light-headed and drunk. I thought it was weird, considering I had just felt fine, and only had a few sips of the drink he made me.

Anywho, but this time, due to a change in my teacher's schedule, was at a junior high school across town pretty far from our suburb. So, as we were on our way back, it was getting pretty dark, being that it was late fall and the sun was setting much earlier than usual. Mom glanced at her dashboard and groaned – we were almost out of gas. She resigns to pull over at the nearest gas station and fill up just enough for us to get home. Ho hum, and – ""Ugh


The sleeping man at the cash register is obviously not prepared for this at the end of the day. He mumbles, ma'am, how may I help you?"" (I'm sure her being beautiful didn't really hurt in this case). He starts talking to her about her day, and I let the voices fade into the background while I stare at the treasure trove before me that is gas station junk food. To a 9 year old with about 32 sweet teeth, it's heaven. Hmmm..... Chocolate bar? Crunchy chips? Sour morsels? What to choose, what to choose. I am so lost in a reverie of excitement I almost fail to hear the bell over the shop door ring. Almost. 


In lilts an African-American man, looks first at mom as she is perusing the magazine rack, then at me. His gait changes, something in his eyes seems to sharpen and he makes a beeline in my direction. He immediately begins to talk to me. ""Well hello there, little one,"" he drawls. ""You pickin' yourself out somethin' tasty?"" I stiffen a bit, but there's no harm done yet,"" I say. In all her motherly instinct, I notice he is looking in the direction of our car parked outside. ""Now, smiling at me


As soon as we got in, and said ""Well that guy was a little creepy,"" with a giggle. We quickly forgot about him and set on our merry way home while I smacked my bubblegum happily. It was early evening and almost dark. By the time we got across town and back to our sleepy, wooded suburb, it was dark out and a half hour later. Mom had a late-night shuttle party to attend (she works for NASA), and my 19-year-old aunt Paige had been dropped off and waiting inside for us so she could watch me, since the party would run late. Mom kissed me goodbye,"" and was on her way.


So, still masticating a wad of pink, sticky bubblegum that must've accrued 7 or so pieces. Then, out of nowhere, the doorbell rings. 


It is about 8 o'clock at night and pitch black outside, even in the fall. In the darkness I can't see his face too well, but I do see a nondescript van parked in our driveway behind him. Since there are no curtains in this window, he sees me almost immediately and says ""Hello there, would you open the door for a minute? I want to ask you something,"" in a heavy drawl. As I hear Paige walking up behind me to the door, I see him smile. Not just a smile, and even in the dim light


He is the man from the gas station. In my 9 year old mind, but also instinctively afraid. Something about seeing that tooth set me off and as Paige opens the door a sliver I slam it shut, turn the deadbolt and yell ""I'm sorry, you have to go away now!"" He looked surprised to see Paige standing behind me for that split second the door was open, but I wasted no time in moving. I grabbed her hand and yanked her into the hallway, out of sight, where she was about to give me the mother of all talking-to's. ""What the hell was that for


Of course I breathlessly try to explain the gas-station and the creepy vibe, and returns to her shows on the couch. I called mom and told her what happened, and she came home immediately. I am lucky to have a mom that trusted my instincts. We all got little sleep that night, but we still never heard from the man with the gold tooth again. 


It was not until a little later that mom and I started to piece together some of the implications. While the idealistic 9 year old me tried to say ""well maybe I was mean.... maybe it was a coincidence that he turned up here, he would have seen my mom leave and thought I was home alone. The fact that behind our back yard is nothing but a huge open field with tall grass also made for a stomach-turning coincidence. The gas station, the conversation, the van, the distance, the heavy coat – it all made me feel so uneasy.

1360474082.0,188ft9,Lives in the same apartment complex...,jeridanielle,129,26,21,"Backstory: I am in my fourth year of undergrad (traditional student

Welcome Weekend last Fall:  I'm working an event that consists of one-act plays that are supposed to give students some basic information on situations such as bullying/harassment, after which a co-worker or myself tell the students about resources on campus like the Women's Center and the LGBT club.  Afterward, I am sitting at a table with pamphlets and an older male, non-traditional student approaches and starts talking.  I quickly find out that he has a history of drug abuse, and he lingers and chats until I excuse myself to help with the next round of plays.

During the first week of class, so I correct him and tell him I live off-campus.  He asks where, and being a horrible liar/unable to think on my feet/unaware of impending creep, I tell him the street.  He basically says, ""No way me, too!"" and asks where, and again with my horrible foresight I tell him it's a weird shaped complex, and at one point says something about seeing or hearing my bathroom (the complex is small and shaped like a U).  After he leaves

Another night during the first week of class, I spot him from a distance and freak out a little, telling my co-officers that I saw him and want to avoid him so I go and walk around and visit other club tables.  While I'm writing my e-mail on a club list, he lurks near and says, ""traitor!""  I'm stuck.  I step into a cordial role and try to conduct small talk.  I'm getting antsy and tell him I should get back to my club table, when he says, ""you can leave whenever you want, but he follows me and lingers for a good 10 minutes until a friend creates a diversion for me to get away.  A bit later, he talks about walking home

He finds me on Facebook a couple days later (my name is not common) and sends me this message: ""hi there i hope your having a great weekend it was nice to see you on thursday so don't do anything i would not do"".  A couple days later, I come home to a facebook message from him, ""hi there i hope everything is ok if by chance i get on your nerves or if i do or say something that crosses any lines just tell me,"" to which I responded, ""i'm just not comfortable being friends really"".

Throughout the semester, claiming that my boss ""isn't doing his job"".  Even after my boss tried to talk with him and tell him that he (my boss) couldn't be his (creeper's) counselor, he continued to lurk around my boss's office.

From the time club meetings started, a volunteer for Obama came in to speak about the importance of voting and asked for volunteers for phoning.  He tried to battle the volunteer, belittling them by saying stuff about local politics.  When no one agreed with him, he got in a weird fluster and left.  Later, the entire club received and e-mail from him ""apologizing"" while still arguing his point.

Sometime after midterms, he attempted to ""call us out"" by talking of himself as an adult who speaks his mind and saying we never took his thoughts into consideration, and said that we ""intentionally excluded him""/""never made an effort to include him"" at events.  At some point he claimed that he had ""gone through more than any of you [us] will ever go through"".

That right there is what tipped the scale for me.  As a survivor of multiple sexual assault incidents

Of course he responded, but apparently he continued lurking around my boss.

I haven't thought much about this whole situation until recently.  Late semester, had my windshield replaced, and moved on.  Just the other day, however, I came home to see the passenger sideview mirror broken off and nowhere in sight.  I open my vehicle and see the glovebox open, things strewn everywhere, and my rearview mirror detached and laying on the dashboard.

 Please forgive my writing style I haven't got much sleep the past few days and this is kind of a rambling vent. I love this subreddit also. Far more scary then a lot of true paranormal stuff.


 I've played World of Warcraft (or WoW) for a few years. Yes there are hazards of being a female player such as lewd comments and what not but I rarely if ever encountered that. I suppose I was lucky to have involved myself with people who respect a person's playing skills instead of focusing on their sex. I used to play on a pure PvP server (Player vs Player) but myself and a friend decided to change things up. Being a fan of D&amp;D etc we decided two years ago to move to an RPPvP server to test the waters of WoW RP. It was a big mistake. 


 Every server has its own unique community and we made friends quickly with some great people. We joined a guild and became active contributors. it all seemed normal if not far more relaxed then the competitive sharp edge of a PvP server. It was a nice change. One of the people we befriended was a player named Phil. He seemed like a normal every day guy wanting to RP with the guild and was funny as hell. Myself


 Things seemed normal. My gut didn't give me any creep vibes at all from this Phil person. From what I saw he had a girlfriend who played WoW also. They even role played a wedding on that game. Myself


 Six months went by and one day my boyfriend and I got into an argument. I was miserable logged and onto WoW just to not deal with it. Phil seemed to sense something was up and kept asking me what was wrong until finally I told him that there was an argument. That was it, someone I trusted was pouring their heart out to me like this and it was absolutely not reciprocated. I gently turned him down and told him that although I was flattered, I didn't feel the same way and that I was in love with my boyfriend who was his friend and that he should respect it. Phil let out a mournful statement ""Now I have to put you in the friend zone. I can never be with you!""


 A little history on this guy Phil. He isn't very stable. He came to me in confidence and told me about how he was arrested and thrown into the psych ward multiple times for attacking his Mom then trying to commit suicide. He also bragged about using women who were depressed to get sexual favors out of them. He quickly recanted it though claiming he was joking when I got angry with him. Other than him sometimes coming to me and talking to me about his personal problems there was no indication of any attraction from his end. 


 It was different after that. I told my boyfriend what happened and he was not happy at all. He considered Phil a friend and what he did violated his trust and respect. He barely tolerated him if not at all. I don't blame him. Phil was a different person after that. He became obsessive and clingy. He kept bringing up that I was making a mistake and that NO ONE would love me as much as he did. He kept making ultimatums and threatened our friendship claiming he was quitting the game pretty much anything he could to try and change my mind. He didn't respect the fact I could make a fucking choice to be with someone I love. It's like he didn't understand I have the right to choose who I want to be with I didn't HAVE to be with him because he claimed he loved me.


 It got to the point he pretended to overdose/suicide on vent (a program people can use to talk to each other). I wish I was kidding. My boyfriend got pissed and logged off and I got very angry. I blew up at him how dare he pull this shit (my brother overdosed in front of me when he was suffering from drug abuse as a teen and Phil knew of this) I ripped him a new asshole telling him to quit his shit or I would ignore him and tell everyone what he was doing. I also told him I was going to call 911 right then and there to go and save him. Phil clammed up quickly and left vent. Not two hours later he was miraculously okay. 


 Things seemed to quiet after that. Phil stopped communicating with me and stayed away from our group of friends. It was peaceful. A month later he came back with a new girlfriend and I breathed a sigh of relief. Okay


 He became quiet again but a week went by and he started saying ""I love you"" to me in front of our friends and he started posting on my Facebook wall things about me breaking up with my boyfriend. Apparently random girls were sending him nudes to which he would text me and be like


 It didn't stop him though. He figured out my Skype info and started messaging me there. He also pestered my friends in game (who were wise to what he was doing) about me. Wanting to know info about me. It got to the point he asked someone for my personal address. In the end all of my friends blocked him from communicating with them and it seemed like it was over. Now and then he would try to communicate with me or one of my friends claiming he wanted to have a friendship again but he was promptly shut down. I wish I could convey in words the drama and misery he created with all the things he did. There was absolutely nothing to salvage. 


 We all moved onto bigger and better things, my fiance, and our friends joined immediately ran to my defense and pretty much had to threaten Phil's image to guilds he role plays with to get info from him. Phil at first tried to refuse claiming he would only talk to me but once his image was threatened he relented and he forked over the damage he did. He tried to claim I was being targeted ,completely random btw, that my personal info was released, pictures of me, and my WoW info. With some investigating it turns out Phil was the one who hacked into my personal emails and various other goodies and tried to ruin me some how by posting it on a dangerous website. It's frightening what he tried to do and all because I didn't want to be in an on line relationship with him. What's more crazy he told my guild master that he should make sure that I email him thanks for letting me know what happened. What a douche bag. 


 I consider myself lucky because it could have been far worse. He lives thousands of miles away from me. What damage was done was the end of a friendship I thought I had, and loss of security. I don't feel safe right now and I contacted the proper authorities in my area and I'm going to be filing harassment charges against him. Luckily I screenshot his nuttiness. Also I wrote a GM ticket begging for help regards to Phil's actions. He used to be my friend and I did care about him now I hate him. He wont stop, it doesn't matter how much time passes. Every few months he comes back and this is the climax. I just want peace. I realized long ago Phil didn't ""love"" me. He wanted to control me and him interjecting himself into my life now and then is him stilling trying to maintain control some how. Is it really so hard to just let go? If you have feelings for someone and they don't share them, the greatest way to show that you truly do care is that you respect them and let them be.


TL;DR - Guy becomes progressively more obsessed and destructive in our friendship ultimately causing him to be alienated. In revenge he posts my personal information on a malicious website and hacks my personal emails.

The layout of my upstairs is this: once on the top floor, with nothing but a single sink and tiny counter with drawers.

For that split second my eyes were closed to wash the soap off my face

Then, as if someone was leaning against it. I was frozen in silence. With the shower off, I could do nothing but listen. They never said anything. My phone was charging on my bed. I thought that if they couldn't hear my scared panting, they would hear my heartbeat.

It was probably 3 hours of sitting in the shower before I felt comfortable enough to slowest open the door to my room, and my wallet, Jewelry, and stereo were missing. Even my makeup bag was dumped on the floor, in someone's search for valuables.

This story took place in the mid 80's, older sister &amp; I) were staying with my aunt (her sister) and her family. My aunt and her then-husband had a nice piece of property, maybe 1/2 acre wide by 1 1/2 acres deep, dotted with oak trees and the remains of an ancient fruit orchard. The property inclined sharply from the road, crested about halfway through, then sloped downward at the back. On this property are two houses; the first is a very small, century-old farmhouse set into the hill, though, and camped out a few nights to avoid paint fumes.  My mom

The little house has an interesting layout- the house is built into the hill, but the living area is in the upper part of the house only. Under the middle part of the house is an odd-shaped root cellar/storage space/crawl space that is accessible only by double doors on the outside of the house and is barely tall enough to stand in. The ground floor (or first story) facing the street is an unfinished room usually used for storage since there is no insulation. Like the other storage room, there is no access to the upper part of the house, only a door that opens to the driveway that borders the house and leads to the big house. This room has two tiny windows set into the rock wall facing the street but no electrical wiring so at night it's pitch black. This room is directly under what at the time was the living room.

One day, and my aunt's husband (who worked nights) was napping in the big house. It was probably around nine or ten, and I had just finished watching some cartoons. I turned off the tv, but was puzzled to still hear music. The sound was soft and words were indistinct, but I could still make out the melody of ""Twinkle, twinkle little star."" I knew we were the only ones home, and I couldn't figure out why the tv would still be making noise, I went straight into the kitchen to tell my mom:

""I hear someone singing. It's coming from under the floor.""

She looked at me strangely, then without warning grabbed me and ran to the back door, pausing only for her keys, and ran to her car. The car was parked behind the small house, and as we drove down the driveway, we had to pass by the storage room doors. As we passed, the door to the larger storeroom opened and a man we had never seen before stepped out to watch us drive away.

My mom drove to her parent's house across town and called the big house to warn my aunt's husband- no answer. She then called my aunt at work, my aunt had a discussion with my mom, which I didn't hear about until years later. Apparently, my aunt's husband had a soft spot for those down on their luck, and had a habit of letting them stay at the little house between renters. Apparently he had told some guy he could spend a few nights in the storeroom, but hadn't told anyone, including his own wife or the single women with children (us) who were sharing the house at night alone with this ""roommate."" My aunt admitted later that because of the type of people that showed up randomly

(This was especially disturbing as not only were most of the ""hard luck"" guys druggies/drunks, but many are released directly into our community.)

My mom, normal house. We only went back to the other place to get our things, and the little house was rented out shortly after. My aunt divorced my uncle a year or two later, and we lost touch with him after that.

That's not the end of the story

I NOW LIVE IN THAT SAME HOUSE.

My aunt's ex had kept the property in the divorce, and we heard through the grapevine that the house might be up for rent again soon, and we reconnected with my aunt's ex. He had long ago stopped letting drifters use the house, and while the house has a few drawbacks due to its age and shoddy construction, the property is beautiful and more than makes up for the uneven floors and lack of AC. The odd layout of the house means that any of the bedrooms could be used as a living room, so when we moved in, we chose to use the back room as our living room, and I feel totally comfortable in the house- I've slept there alone and been fine. We use the front storeroom for just that purpose- storing stuff. This room will always be creepy, and we keep it locked.

Every once in a while, headed for that door...which is just below the windows in the room where we sleep.

I came home from work at about 10:30 pm. I had worked a double so I was pretty tired and out of it by the time I arrived home, but sleazy is a good way of putting it), but I have lived here for about a year now and nothing ever happened so I figured I would be fine to grab my cell from my car. I'm about to leave my apartment when I get a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. Enough things have happened for me to know to trust my instincts, so I grab a tazer that my boyfriend gave me not long ago.

I walk through my building and outside to the parking lot. My car is about 50 ft. left of the door, obviously drunk. I don't really think anything of it as I see drunk people shortcutting though the lot all the time. 

I reach my car and quickly grab what I need, wildly swinging his keys in the air, and his pace quickens. 

Suddenly he's standing not 10 feet from me, and he doesn't say anything but takes a few more steps towards me still swinging those keys.

At this point I NOPE, ""Back up."" He reels back a bit, stops swinging his keys, and looks me up and down. Now I'm not the most intimidating person, (20 y/o female, 5'6"") but it seems that the tazer was enough, he backed off, making sure to lock the front

I don't even want to think about what might have happened if I hadn't listened to my gut feeling.

1340059558.0,v8wkz,Minnesota Nice Can Get You in Trouble...,TheRipsawHiatus,114,12,27,"This happened about four years ago when I was seventeen. Me, and cousin

Well, and it was time for dinner, I was grateful to sit down and be done with walking through the crowds at Macy's. 
We were all sat at this long table that was lengthwise parallel to an equally long window that faced the street the parade was going to be coming down. It was a perfect view! We could eat dinner and stay warm from the Minnesota cold while we watched the event. It really could not have been better. 

At dinner, I would smile and maybe throw out a friendly wave to them. I've always been a firm believer that the small gesture of a friendly smile can brighten someone's day, even a little bit.

One man walked by slowly and looked in the window. He looked poor, and went back to eating my food. 

A few minute later, and went on eating my dinner. 

However, I started to worry. As did everyone else.
Even more so when he finally stopped walking by the window
I tried to not make eye contact with him anymore, sure enough he hadn't moved. 
Then he just disappeared from across the street. We all thought, ""Don't turn around. He's in the restaurant.""


At this point, trying to make conversation with my best friend, but he was hard to ignore when in my peripherals I see him sit down at the table right next to us. 

He turned his chair slightly, she's a huge paranoid basket-case, and the biggest worry-wart I know, I kept telling her to just shut the fuck up and get some dessert. I was worried that he would hear us talking about him.

After staring at me for five minutes, furiously writing things down, and occasionally taking a break to look over at me. This went on for about an hour. 

It came to the point when I had to pee, so did he. But he quickly sat back down when he saw my friends stand up too. He watched me as I walked to the bathroom. 

We came back to the table, it was almost, *almost*, easy to forget he was even there. After all, I was in a public place, surrounded by people, friends, it wouldn't be easy for him. 

The parade started, less than a foot away, with a letter in his hand. He spoke to me, and well, I couldn't understand him. He was clearly mentally handicapped. I really wish I could make out what he said, but I can tell you his voice was kind, and non-threatening. I simply smiled and nodded and said, OK."" I took the letter he handed me

I waited for him to leave before I looked at the letter
 
Now I had saved these notes for a couple years

For starters, and the entire letter was incoherent. So, if what I'm about to write is hard to follow, well that's the point.

The letter started out strange right from the get-go. He said he saw me on a bus a long time ago, I don't ride the bus, and I don't have a little girl). He said he thought I was beautiful and my little girl looked like an angel. In fact, he was convinced we were both angels, him as well. He said he would often think of me, and hope that I was doing OK, and that my little girl was safe. He was so excited to see me today at the restaurant, he knew it was me. He would recognize that smile anywhere. 

Then things got creepier:

He told me how he has a little girl too, where the government wont find us, like Canada, Holland, or Israel. So we can be a family, and I can have lots of golden-haired children with him and make God proud of us. 

Yeah, and I couldn't help but feel bad for him. I'm guessing by how jumbled and incoherent the letter was, he was probably schizophrenic. 
I think everyone at the table felt a bit sad for this guy, he was just *very* confused.  

The parade had ended, waiting on the corner across the street. He saw me walk out and immediately started running towards me. Luckily there was a huge crowd of people on the streets heading home from the parade, and we easily let ourselves slip away in to the crowd, and entered a nearby building to take the skywalk out of there. 
And that was the last I saw of him.

I had gone in there to meet new people, and he sat down and started to ask me questions.  Where did I work? Where did I live? Did I have any relatives? etc.  Of course, during the discourse, I asked him questions and found out that he was a traveling salesman who travelled I 40 from Ohio to Asheville. The last question he asked me was how old I was.   When I told him, he couldn't believe me.  I looked a lot younger than I was.  At the time, I was 29, but looked like a teenager.   Part of my kitch was to show people my ID, too.  As soon as he saw it

I didnt think anything of it until I went to get another cup of coffee.  The guy behind the coffee bar asked me if the old man was bothering me.  I told him that it wasn't anything I couldn't handle and thanked him for his concern.

The next night I went to a strip club with my on again off again boyfriend that had just opened up a town over.  My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to strip because someone had offered the manager $500 for me to strip.   I didn't want to

He came up to me later on that night and started talking to me about how many people he had killed in Vietnam--especially young woman and children.  I was really creeped out then and edged away from him and found another group of friends to hang with and made sure I as never alone.  He didn't try anything

I kind of freaked out, and they were looking for a serial killer who was killing young girls from Ohio to Asheville off of I40.  They werent sure but they thought he was an older guy who probably was a traveling salesman.  The cops thought that he had a thing for woman who had my characteristics and were 18 and under.

It was the mid 90’s and we had just moved to Miami, rape and murder of a boy only a grade older than me. His name was Jimmy Ryce. It was the first time I learned that there were bad people around who did bad things.

I’ll never forget how much my parents and teachers stressed me not to talk to strangers, tips and tricks to help keep me safe after that. I think it’s safe to say I was a bit more cautious and aware of my surroundings than I would have been otherwise had it not been for Jimmy. 

Well on this particular day when I was walking down the avenue home from school, once again waiting for me to cross the road.

But after about 3 more blocks of this

Fast forward a few weeks later and it’s Friday. I’m super excited for the weekend and my best friend Luis is walking home with me so we can play video games and watch movies after school.

Well as we’re walking home together, and refiled the thoughts I harbored of him ""probably being lost"", and replaced them with the ""oh my god"" as I realized I was possibly being targeted by this person. 

As soon as I noticed him I tried to play it cool. I didn’t want him to read my face. I told Luis not to look

As we crossed the street I tried to nonchalantly draw my eyes over to the drivers seat to see the face of the man inside the car

I’ve read a few times before that when someone points a gun at you and you’re in their cross-hairs, but my body could feel his eyes watching me while I crossed the road in a way that gave me feel terribly uneasy. The only way to describe it was feeling like a big hungry alligator was really mad at me and I didn’t know why.

My skin was crawling as he turned around the street and pulled up again in front of the next stop sign. I could tell by the way he drove that his attitude was different this time. The first time it seemed he was trying to be inconspicuous and just blend in, and would inch the car closer to us at the stop sign to intimidate us whereas before he would stay fairly well behind the white line. 

It felt like he was getting himself pumped up for something. 

We were totally freaked out

While he drove around the block to meet us at the stop sign at the street my house was on, and Luis pulled the pencil and paper out of his backpack and I read him the plate numbers real quick.

He definitely noticed what was going on

At this point he wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore. It was time to run.

As soon as he turned the corner we bolted all the way to my house as fast as we could move. I don’t know if I said anything to Luis

 Anyway

Before that moment I had only seen him pulling up to the stop sign

Luckily enough we were fast and able to unlock the door and get inside just before he pulled down our street. I stared out the peek-hole and watched his car slowly drive around a few times before he finally disappeared.

I called my mom and told her to come home because we just got chased my some weird man and she rushed home and we told her everything. Thankfully

I don’t know if I’ll ever really know what happened, and that he denied everything, and his parents were surprised, but that the cops thought he was a fucking weirdo and didn’t believe anything he said. 

They told him they were going to be watching him cause they know what he was doing and that if I ever saw him again they were gonna personally come back for him and they scared the shit out of him.

1363287964.0,1aaubt,The Honeymooners,clash_by_night,130,26,11,"I worked at Holiday Inn one summer before starting grad school. I was a part of food and beverage service

One night, so housekeeping never went in, either. After a couple of days, the staff started talking about this sort of strange behavior. I assumed that they were perhaps on their honeymoon. It was the only thing that even remotely explained why they never left the room and didn’t want to be disturbed. 

After about three days, and we were running out of trays. Even if they didn’t understand that they were supposed to return the trays, there’s a little card on each one that explains that when they are done with the meal, guests can set the tray outside their room and someone will come and get it. 

Finally, lunch, and dinner, so they had to have had more than a half-dozen trays in their room. With our manager’s permission, we called and asked if we could remove some of the trays from their room. The guy, who had been extremely polite the entire time, said sure. Another girl and I got a cart and headed off to the room. 

The man met us at the door dressed only in shorts, so lots of alone naked time with the new spouse is expected. He was at least wearing clothing. We quickly went in and noticed several odd, disturbing things. 

First, including the TV, and even the floor. Each one had half-eaten food. This is two or three days worth of old food just sitting in the room. That’s pretty gross, to start with. 

Second, not that unusual, but she seemed to be really out of it. I thought she had to have been under the influence of something, or perhaps sick or injured. She didn’t speak to us, but she was mumbling a bit and her eyes weren’t focusing on anything.  It was completely bizarre. 

Third, so nearly 100 degrees outside. We were in a sweat just being in the room for a minute or two. Again, the woman had the blankets completely covering her body, except for when she moved slightly and they slipped off. 

We got our stuff loaded up and the guy, what we had just seen was incredibly weird. 

I went from thinking this was a young couple on a very sex-filled honeymoon to wondering if this woman was sick or going through detox or something. It was just overall weird. Hot room, the woman’s behavior, their reluctance to let anyone in, even to clean, and their reluctance to leave… it was strange. 

I was concerned about her

Oh, or maybe their sweat from the damn heat, but it was awful. 

To this day

Location: New England


So I remember one day after school, and I remember it was still light out but getting dark, so it was probably around 4pm-4:30pm.  


We didn’t live on a busy street, well this guy wasn’t even doing 5mph.  The first couple of times he drove by we didn’t really notice and didn’t think much about it, as this was the time of day when a lot of people started coming home from school and work, and besides we were involved in our little football game.  But every time the van drove by, and like I said he kept driving by real slow, we saw the guy in the van looking out at us, as if he was checking us out.  After that 3rd and 4th time we started to get a little freaked out about it.  What is that guy doing?  Why is he checking us out? Why does he keep driving by real slow, we definitely got a good look at him.  He was a younger guy in his 20’s, but my other couple of friends wanted to finish the game and argued that it would be dark soon so if we went in now we’d never get to finish the game.  Also they reminded me that my dad was home


Wrong decision.  We had barely completed one more play, he’s driving even slower! But instead of slowly driving by us like every other time, this time the van stops right in front of us.  My heart stops and I freeze in my tracks, my other friend, the one who wanted to go in, took a few steps back towards the house ready to run if anything happened.  That's when the guy in the van rolls down the window and started talking to us.  We couldn’t hear what he said, and while I was still frozen in my tracks


That’s when my dad came outside.  “What do you want!?” He angrily said to the guy, but not before driving by one more time.  This time he didn’t stop though.  So apparently my dad saved us from a creeper, or so we thought.


*NOW THIS IS WHERE THE STORY GETS WEIRD!*  I was actually the guy driving the van.  Lol.  One Christmas break from college, so I drove down and back yet again trying to find it.  Still nothing.  These kids were on the side of the street where the house should have been.  They were at like house number 119 or something (while I’m looking for 125), but the road curved shortly after their house and then there was a little wooded area, and then the next thing you know you’re looking at houses with addresses in the 130’s.  Hmmm.  Having no luck finding the house on my own, I pulled up to the kids and asked if they knew where the Clarks lived (hoping one of them would say, “that’s me” or “they live right there”).  The kids didn’t hear me at first (them being on the passenger side of the van), so one of them came up to hear what I was saying.  That’s when the dad came out, and couldn’t find the house (apparently though people often ordered flowers for family/friends but got their address slightly wrong a lot, then tries to talk to kids playing in the front yard.  That’s the thing about a lot of these stories though

In Michigan there is a place called Traverse City. It's a smallish, an old rusty water tower, a huge stone basin in the middle of the woods that could hold maybe fifty people- you know, the works. This isn't the creepy part, believe it or not, as nothing scary really happened there. It was actually quite the popular hangout for college kids to get stoned and whatnot. It's more of a small detail on how strange this town is, and kind of a backstory. See, the patients were basically let loose to their own devices and many of them ended up as one of the many homeless people that roamed the town. And some of them just ended up in The Whiting.

The Whiting was the cheapest apartment in town, and had to be shut down when some man was found dead of heroin overdose on the front steps. It reopened to the public again, and some of the people who had lived there previously had nowhere else to go and moved back in. At this point of the story, I was a brokeass college kid. I got some weird vibes from the place but was short on money and thought it would be an interesting experience anyways. I wasn't wrong.

First of all, some swooping around, some that started out normal and then got so narrow that you literally had to walk sideways to fit. There was painted over doors, doors that led to nowhere, tiny doll-sized doors in the hallway that never opened. Creepy pictures of crying girls or off-putting abstract paintings decorated the walls. My friend lived in a small room that had a large mysterious 'X' painted over his bed. He also had a painted-over, locked door to his left. And my other friend who lived on the second story, at the end of the building

Bizarre, and that she was sleeping with a knife for protection. Another friend of mine once opened her door and found an entire lamp, taken apart piece by piece and aligned on her doorstep. 
A few incidents stick out in my mind. Once I went down to the shared kitchen to make myself lasagna (often you could find free food when the schizophrenics left them for fear of government interference. They would leave garbled notes with the food and everything). One of the women was already there, made all the more intimidating because she had a habit of ramming people in the shoulder when she passed them in the halls. She's sitting there and she's mocking me and insulting me the whole time, but all to herself as if I can't hear her, all while eyeing me with a sideways, dead-eyed kind of look. Every now and then, she gives a high-pitched giggle that sounded truly sinister. Well, I say ""everything alright?"" and she's muttering to herself ""the thing's talking to me, giggle giggle"" and I am definately perplexed at this point. I pick up a fork and I'm getting ready to exit and she really flips and starts talking rapidly, going on about murdering her. And just like some movie
Another time a man, and he tried to slur some nonsense at me while I walked by him- think he said something about a ""shower"". Well, he reaches out and grabs my arm and pulls me toward him. I pull away so fast he gets knocked over, and as I'm running up the stairs he's trying to collect himself and stand up. I hide in my friend's room and we can hear him slouching and banging up the stairs, calling for me in a doped up sort of way. A week later, he apparently forgets about it and I see him in the lobby. He asked me which room I lived in.

It was a nice sized two bedroom house and because of the location rent was very cheap. There were few other houses in the area so we thought it would be a great place to host parties, briefly.

Eventually the husband and daughter who was visiting came over and escorted her out of the house.

We spoke with our landlord and he assured us that he would tell her that if anything like this happened again they would be evicted.

Things were fine for a few weeks until one day when I came home from work to find that the sliding glass door in my room (which was always locked and had been in fact blocked by my desk since the day I moved in) was open and our front door (also always locked) was wide open and my cat was wandering around outside.

Ryan and I thought it would be fun if we went outside late and sat in the moonlight and told scary stories, so anyways, we were laughing and talking about what would we do in the predicament of the stories. We could clearly see around the yard, the moon was almost full and it was so bright!

It is now 3AM and Ryan and I are quiet just looking around while we sit on the porch. I begin to hear a noise, but I continue to listen. I turn of my phone and blow out the small candle we had lit on the cement.

""What the hell?"" He asked.

""Shhh..."" I whispered. I then saw him. Or her, who was walking now?

I then realized maybe it could be someone going to work

I wasn't truly scared until he stopped. He stopped right in front of our house, and with all the power out, maybe we were more visible? Ryan and I froze, just standing there dumbfounded this guy was just watching us. He didn't move, his body a shadow in the night just watching. 

When Ryan and I moved was when he did, forgetting the candle outside. Which made especially creepier is, one, we were listing to Creepypasta stories, two, once we were inside and we closed the door locking the bolt and closing the hatch.

So I live in NY and was going into the city to meet my parents after work one day. I think I was about 18 at the time, thinking that it was very crowded and he probably didn't mean to do that. I decided to look at him as little as possible, so I instead would look down at the floor and his shoes or to my right out a window across from me. I kept counting the stops, feeling very nervous even though I told myself there was no reason to. So as I was studiously trying not to look at the man in front of me I turned to my left. A man there was looking at me with a very odd expression. It for some reason made me wonder what was going on with the man in front of me so I turned to look...to see out of the corner of my eye that the man had his dick fully out and erect in my face. I panicked. I had no idea what to do. I leaned away from him as much as possible and refused to look at him. I noticed that he kept leaning in with the motions of the car and leaning further into me but I refused to look. I had no idea what to do in this situation. There was nowhere to go, the car was packed. Finally my stop came and I ran off as quickly as possible. I found my mom soon afterward and cried, I was so shocked. We found a police officer and told him about the incident but he wasn't concerned. 
Now I make sure never to sit in the edges of subway cars and next time I will stand up and make a scene rather than sit there. I know this isn't much for most of the posts on Letsnotmeet

I am in summer school in college right now, so there are very rarely any problems.

Well, so I'm never truly worried about myself.

I've been lurking on letsnotmeet for about a week now

Now onto the actual story. It was around 12:30am tonight, so I was taking in the lovely peace and quiet.

Suddenly there was a loud knock on my door. They were solid and loud, who sometimes come around to try and find her.

I look in the peephole. I do not recognize this man. He is a college student, like he doesn't want to make eye contact even through the peep hole. I am instantly on alert, but I remind myself that he very well may be an RA, since I noticed there's a lanyard around his neck (no students wear lanyards around there necks here). 

I open the door
I don't scream. Instead

And so when I take a step towards him, I was so deep in my mode, but apparently I'd punched him multiple times, leading him half way through the hall in fear.
I see my roommate, and I step back into my room, shaking my head. My roommate apologizes, saying that she thought I'd just scream and laugh about it. Some of her friends had found the gas mask, and wanted to see how many people they could scare. I ended up scaring them more.

Apparently I'd taken the advice from a thread on here of looking terrifying and angry

In the end it was harmless

1342230834.0,wj4gu,Mini Manson,amanda_pandemonium,132,30,40,"Recently, and I agreed

Some back-story:
I've known Dawn, her husband, Charlie, her thirteen year old, and Austin, her twelve year old, since I was about six.  My parents are close to Dawn and George
About three years ago, and before it. He'd scream until he threw up when Dawn and George left, scared that they wouldn't come back to him. Seeing him so scared and sad, well, he's always had a special place in my heart. He's eleven now, and a part of the family, more or less. 
Charlie and Austin have never liked him much, lies, steals, and breaks their things. All that slowed down, and then stopped, but he had caused them a significant amount of problems, damn near tore their family apart. 

Fast forward three years, I've noticed, are always tense around him. Whatever, they're stressed and busy, no big deal. 

The first four days I watched them weren't bad

Today was my last day

Nope. 

Turns out, and Charlie is hiding in his room playing COD. 

And they're out of coffee

I separate the boys, and shit is getting done. 

And then my headphones break.

It's still quiet though, and check on Tommy who has gotten practically nothing done so far. 

Tommy then starts complaining about how he always has more chores than Charlie and Austin, but he DOES have more chores than his two brothers today, so I offer to help him fold the laundry so long as he promises to behave today. 

Charlie and Austin wander back to the living room/kitchen area to return dishes

Then he starts saying that I hate him, I don't care what happens to him, etc. I replied, rather calmly, ""Tommy, I want you to listen. I know you're just being dramatic, and I know that you know none of this is true. Calm down, try to stop crying

Hysterics continue.

By this time, or being the mean babysitter, I let him take his iPod touch to play around on while he's calming down.

Then I go downstairs

After fifteen minutes

When I walk in, in about a foot and a half of space between the two. He's also singing along to a pop song and wearing nothing but boxers, and was rolling around on the floor rubbing his front side on it. 

He didn't look up or anything when I called his name

I walk over and sit on the edge of his bed. From where I am, and really poor quality. 

It's a snuff film.

 Then, he hadn't been able to see me where he was laying. He jumped, hid the screen, and hit the exit button. 

""Tommy
""Nothing!""
""Give me the iPod.""

I walk into the hallway

There was hentai (which is odd for an 11 year old, beastiality videos, rape scenarios, and a shit ton of snuff films.

We ended up at this place that was popular because it was cheap and there was no cover fee. 


I'm sitting there, there were barely any people left and my friend is hooking up with some guy. Then this other guy, with an all douche appearance - tight shirt, unbuttoned all the way down to his belly button, some long heavy necklace around his neck, too much hair products - comes and tries to strike a conversation  with me. I didn't feel like talking to him, and he said ""hey, instead of getting bored by yourself


He apologized, just stupid and he demanded to know why my friend lied to him about me having a boyfriend, and that he could go into the bathroom to find him for me unless of course the said boyfriend was a lie, in which case I had to give him an explanation on why I lied to him- but my friend and I did not want to talk to this guy, he was weird, so my friend told him that we were lesbians and we hugged each other... Yeah, not a smart trick... and he said he respected people like us, I didn't use to drink but there was something very strange about his drink: it wasn't in one of the club's glasses, and never saw any club where they would give you cheap small plastic glasses instead of those made of  real glass, since the club wasn't getting any better and the guy wouldn't leave us alone. 


It was a 15 minute ride to my friends place, it wasn't my friend's first drink ever, and she had been drunk a few times before that night. She said it was deep and it didn't feel like a ""natural"" headache she had ever had before, and was pretty sure it had been the guys drink.

What was in it? we'll never know.

I was dead asleep in my bed, then looked at the side of the bed I was already facing (I never moved my head) and I saw a figure crouched down by my bed. At first, I didn't react, thinking it was just my imagination, but as I became less foggy in my little brain I started to realize it was a PERSON a PERSON was in my room, staring at me. 

I shot up in my bed, pushing me to the bed covering my mouth. I started thrashing around trying to get them off of me, kicking, and just being all around difficult because no way in hell was I gonna die. 

Then, baby! It's just me.”

It was my “boyfriend”. Mind you, stole from me and my aunt and uncle. He threatened to kill me and my family if I ever decided to leave him. Oh, and he WALKED to the house, he did it because he loves me – at least, that's what he said.

That's all that I could think of. He was going to kill me and my aunt and it would be my fault.

I stopped screaming

I'm still scared out of my mind

He stayed with me all night

(I look around the house to see where he got in – it was through the screened area that's over the pool

Now, after walking all night just to get to me, who knows what else he would do.

I did end up leaving him though, would kill my cats, my ex-boyfriends and the like. What cemented my leaving him was because I finally broke down and sort of told my dad what was going on and he explained to me that I was always safe at home. I seemed to forget the fact that my dad has 50+ guns.

1330457372.0,qa2gk,"[MY] Story - Almost Raped, Murdered, Robbed ",GotMeaGunBitches,115,56

This is a throwaway account because I don't want.. I mean.. yeah.  You'll see. 

This happened to me on Friday, just a few months ago.  I am a white female in my early 40's and I live in an urban area known for violence but I live in a rather decent part of town on a quiet, dead-end street. 

It was early evening but dark outside &amp; I was at my car parked in my driveway.  I was cleaning out my car because I was about to take some people to the airport and I was trying to hide the fact that my car can get rather messy.  I have 2 dogs

I noticed the car. I noticed the man - but ZERO red flags were raised because I thought he'd been dropped off and was going into a nearby house.  Also

I walk from my driveway, the hair on my neck stood up and I got goosebumps.  I tried to turn around, but it was too late.  One hand grabbed my shoulder and one hand pressed something HARD into my back and he kept me in the forward facing position. 

He was taller than me and I felt him lean down to whisper, even so, I let go of a tiny bit of urine.  I wish my bladder had been full, maybe he would have been disgusted and run off. 

He kept hold of my shoulder, but he said, ""SHUT UP!"" through clenched teeth.  The tenant wasn't home, anyway. 

I live alone with 2 dogs, even rapists. 

Once he pushed me into the house &amp; looked around (while still holding me) I could tell that he was disappointed because I heard him say ""shit"" under his breath.  I don't have a flat screen TV or other fancy equipment.  I live simply &amp; frugally.  I have a 15 year old tube TV, that's it!  I don't do Christmas so there was no tree &amp; no presents, either.

He pushed me into the bedroom, I didn't want to aggravate him. I concentrated on his shoes.  His very distinctive shoes that I was able to later identify. 

I also got a look at the HUGE mother fucking knife he was holding and a new wave of adrenaline shot through  me and made my eyes kind of blurry, I felt my insides were jelly and that I was going to vomit.   I've never been more scared in my life than that moment.  I told him to take whatever he wanted but please leave me alone.  

He said

I said, you need to use a condom. I have some.""  (I don't, but I was hoping to avoid getting an STD or AIDS if I survived this.)

He smirked

And two thoughts went through my head at the same time: He's done this before.  God damn

And he was calm.  He wasn't breathing heavily

And just then, I absolutely knew he was going to rape THEN murder me, then rob me, in that order.  Dead Certain.  I've never been more sure of anything.

Then the oddest thing happened.  In the space of about 3 seconds I calmed right the fuck down.  I got CLARITY -  My mind was clear, taste, smell, think, LIKE A GOD (or goddess in this case). I realize it was just the adrenaline but I've never felt anything like it.  I stopped shaking.  I stood there marveling at this new feeling for a moment before he repeated the order to take off my pants. 

So I did. In the time it took me to take off my pants

The plan was to lay down on the bed while talking to him and then reach wait for the right moment to pull out my MOTHER FUCKING GUN that I have attached to a custom holster on the back of the nightstand.  I was going to shoot him point blank in the temple if I had to. 

I didn't have to do that because as soon as I took off my pants

He was only out of my line of sight for about 3 seconds but that gave me enough time to reach for the gun.  It's a .38 revolver with no funny business about cocking it or safeties.. it's just point 'n pull the trigger. 

I had the gun raised and leveled at him by the time he came back to the doorway and my hands were NOT shaking, ""OH SHEET"" as he headed for the door faster than could be believed.

I followed him out, alas they were unable to catch the guy.  He still hasn't been caught and I doubt he will be. They were unable to lift prints on the very few things he touched. 

I was completely unhurt physically &amp; mentally

A few addendum points &amp; asides: 

I owe the story of my survival to my good friend Michael (RIP) who willed me his gun when he died a number of years ago.   He didn't like that I lived alone in the urban area that I do.   Thank you, and I miss you terribly.   Thank you for saving my life from the grave. 

I also owe the story of my survival to the custom holster I had made and then installed on the back of my nightstand so that it was both hidden and within easy reach.  The total cost was $100 for everything and I wish I'd done it sooner.  I've had this gun for a number of years and always kept it in the back of the top shelf in the closet.  Had it still been there in the closet

Yes, I'm a damn good shot, I practice!)  I think I would be much worse off psychologically if I killed him, for I am not a killer.  It would be tough for me to live with that. 

That said

As a female who has never pointed a gun at anyone and only used it on the range, I know in my heart that had he come toward me instead of going left toward the front door, I WOULD have emptied the gun into him.  No question. No hesitation or reservation.  I'm glad I know that now.  I hope I never have to use that knowledge.

   Being homeless was a new experience for me and as a single female on my own

   About a week after my arrival, so let’s use Jeff. He started out with “Hi,” and while I was avoiding certain situations, I’m also not a complete ass. I said “Hi,” back and he just kind of hung around. He asked me a couple of other, non-personal questions before informing me that he would be getting an apartment soon and would I be interested in moving in with him?

   I had literally never spoken to this guy before and only seen him around during meals. I have no idea what made him think I would be agreeable. I told him no, and he wandered off.

   After that, that I had a job to get to, and walked away. He would always follow along for a short while but never very far and never showed any signed of aggression or violence so I viewed him as more of a nuisance than anything.

   Eventually I was able to trade my part-time jobs in for one full-time position. It was as a cashier at a local fast food joint in the mall, etc. so those handling money do not also handle food) and I we once earned our store a 98% out of a possible 100% during our busiest hours. This was a big deal to me at the time.

   One day Jeff appeared in my line (there were two) during the lunch rush. When it came his turn to order, he moved aside but attempted to speak over the next customer. At this point I realized I wasn’t going to be able to avoid being rude to him since he was being rude to my other customers so I told him very flatly, “You need to leave. Not even my friends are allowed to visit with me while I’m working.”

   Jeff lost it. It may have been the insinuation that I did not consider him a friend (which of course I didn’t; I didn’t even know him) but he started screaming and swearing and even attempted to come over the counter at me. Immediately my runner

   With that he just stopped screaming and walked away. I only saw him one other time after that. He brought another woman who looked about his age with him and they bought lunch from the other cashier. He then proceeded to glare at me the entire time they sat in the food court and ate.

Wall of text!

I work in a pretty well-known amusement park in the US and part of my job every night is to shut down the park. This means that me and three of my coworkers all walk to the back of the park

Anyway, we met up with these two guys, one super tall and one short, who looked like they were heading out of the park. They actually asked us how to leave and we told them. However, instead of just leaving then and there, like most people do, they stayed. The short one was standing behind one of my coworkers and the tall one directly in front of her. The tall one leaned down (my coworker is like 4’11) and pointed to the pin he was wearing on his shirt, it’s actually in our job description not to touch a guest under any circumstance if we can help it as it could result in us being fired. While he was doing this, what we assumed was the exit.

We did our routes as normal

So I was standing there and I noticed the tall one walking over to me. Obviously it doesn’t take an hour to walk out of the park so of course I was creeped out

Anyway, we just need them to clear the park. I told him so and he asked me if I liked being along in the park at night. Um, not right now, no. He also kept staring directly at my chest. He did not make eye contact once.

He finally left me alone and my coworkers got back from their routes. They had apparently also creeped on the coworker who had split off from the rest of the group after we had given them directions out of the park (which explains what they were doing for that hour). We were all really nervous at this point

We finished clearing the last section of the park when I looked over to the main entrance and realized THEY WERE STILL THERE. They were talking to my OTHER coworkers whose job it was to wave and say goodnight to everyone leaving the park. After they finally left (thanks to our lovely security guards) we found out that these guys

Our security guards told us that if they tried to bother us at the bus stop to call them and they would take care of them. Luckily we didn’t have to do that.

I used to love clearing the park

Last summer me and 3 other friends (2 girls and 1 guy) get bored from sitting around and getting high and decide to go for a hike. I tell them I know of this spot out in the countryside where the river meets a creek

 No problemos

 We head off on the trail and everything is going good. About 15 minutes from the pond

He finds a hatchet.. a clean


On our way back to the trail I see one of the men that we saw earlier coming out of the brush a couple feet to the side of the trail.. he looks frantic and is sweating heavily. I say what's up to him just trying to come off non hostile.. He asks me what we're doing up here and I told him we just came for a hike and a smoke. I ask him the same question and he said he's lost his keys last night on a hike and came back looking for them. I know it's the guy we saw earlier because of the jacket he had on.. same dude 100%. The other 2 guys were missing. He looks at one of the girls (the one that got sick) and asks her what's wrong and if he can do anything to help her.. My buddy told him to fuck off that we didn't want any trouble.. the dude agrees after looking us both up and down a couple times. He starts to walk behind us pretending like he's looking on the ground but I can tell that he's looking at us out of the corner of his eye. We say fuck it and take off down the trail.. he doesn't follow us so I figured he was just mental or being creepy or whatever. 


We're about 20 ft. from the beginning of the trail when I see the other 2 guys sitting by our car and looking inside of it. I tell the girls to wait by a bench and me and my buddy walk up to them and ask whats going on.. they both look at us with the most evil fucking eyes I've ever seen.. the smaller of the 2 guys starts to walk towards my buddy with a smile on his face and asks how he'd like to see his 2 little friends over there get fucked by some real men. I know it's fucked up but as soon as he finishes his sentence I cold cock'd him in the jaw.. He wasn't even looking nor talking to me but I just had this feeling.. the guy that was still up against the car started to reach for something in his pocket and my buddy took his feet out from under him and slammed him to the ground.. just about the same time that I hear the girls scream.. I look back and sure enough the fucker in the jacket is about 6 ft. from the bench.. they unlock the car and run over to us and get in.. the smaller dude is still on the ground and the other guy is getting his shit rocked by my buddy.. The dude in the jacket comes up to me and hits me.. Im kinda shook or whatever but I tackled him and started wailing on him. My buddy comes up and kicks him hard as fuck.. like I'm pretty sure he broke something in the dudes face when he kicked him because dudes head just tilted to the side and his eyes closed.. we got up and left.


None of us say anything about it on the way home.. 3 days later one of the girls calls me up and says that 2 kids from our local elementary school had gone missing the same day this happened. They lived within 2-5 miles of the hiking spot. None of us has ever said a word about what happened or know anything. 


We all agreed that if we went to the police then something would be turned around on us.
Not sure if this is creepy to you guys or just a hero story. But I was freaked the fuck out. If i hadn't have hit the first guy and the dude would have got to the girls who knows what would have happened.

My neighbour, about a 15 minute walk away from our houses. We had to attend it around four times a week and we would always walk there and back together.

One day, following her all the way home. (This was when we were 13 years old, so of course we only ever hung out within walking distance of our houses, and were fairly easy to follow) She was particularly freaked out that day because they had a laser pointer which they were directing at her boobs. She only lived a few minutes away, and we decided to walk her home so she would feel safer.

The guys follow us, always within ten feet of us. If they ever overtook us, they would turn around and come back, eventually circling around us. We thought they would be put off by our presence, and at first it did seem to throw them off. 

We drop her home and start walking back to our house, following us home. They never came too close or said anything to us, but they were always THERE. We would take alternative routes home, and go into shops or cafes to shake them off so they could never actually follow us home. But every day, after class, they would be there, waiting for us. We told all the security guards around about them, but the guys just started waiting for us in a different place.

One night in early 2012, probably about 2am. When we pulled out of the parking lot to leave, a car pulled out behind us. As we went our way, it followed. We were in a busy part of town, so we didn't think much about it. However, my girlfriend is cautious about things like that. So, instead of going the most common route to drop our friend off at her car, but there are several houses spread out and in one spot there are some business-type buildings. We almost never see anyone driving there, maybe they live on one of these roads. Every turn we made

I'll break here to say my girlfriend is a speed demon. She drives like a bat outta hell. She started slowly picking up speed and the car did too. Finally, I just know it was faster than what she usually drives on those roads and faster than what was safe. Anyway, this car is doing it's best to keep up with us. Even when we go down the road with the business buildings instead of the one with the houses, the car still follows us. By now our friend realizes what's going on and she's freaking out in the back seat. We finally get back to the main road and we don't see the car anymore.

We get to my friend's work parking lot where she left her car and we're sitting there for a few minutes trying to get her to calm down so she can drive home. The same damn car pulls into the parking lot with us. We sit there for a few minutes just trying to figure out what these guys are pulling. About a minute later

She wasn't there so the three of us head to the bathroom and between waiting in line and talking (to each other and to some of the women waiting) it takes us about 10 minutes. When we walk out the doors that sectioned off the bathrooms from the rest of the diner, locked the doors, and went back to drop our friend off. I wouldn't let her get out of the car until I made sure nobody was lurking. I told her to go straight home, to make sure she wasn't being followed, and to let us know when she got home and was inside. We went back to the diner parking lot to make sure the guys were still there, which they were. We were there maybe two minutes then we left. The whole way home we were checking to make sure we weren't being followed.

So Tina and I decided to finally show some of the boys we were closest to our secret hang-out spot. We're back there, but my point is that this person was coming from the opposite direction of our neighborhood and my house). They were too far away to see clearly, and I pointed this figure out to the gathered children. Then I saw something shiny in their hand. At this point, they were moving towards us rather rapidly and it was apparent it was a male. My friend, Keith, assumed it was the neighborhood boy no one liked and yelled out, ""Daniel, and I suddenly saw the ""shiny"" object in great detail and realized it was a giant knife.

Let me pause for a moment, on ground level, and you can leave through the basement door, also on ground level.

When I say this is my own fault is because, to take midnight walks.  I lived in a pretty urban neighborhood, which wasn't really known for being good. some things happened around there, but nothing like rape or murder, or anything on those lines.  Not until me, of course.  Sorry if i babble, this is my first time writing about what happened

I have insomnia.  I've had it since 6th grade, but rest is usually waking up every hour or so and then falling right back to sleep.  That night, i couldn't.  For the fear he might find me again, i cannot say anything about when or where or who, because if i did he coul find me.

Again, dressed in shorts, a t-shirt and a sweater tied around my waist. grabbed my backpack with my wallet and school stuff, and quietly snuck out the back door.  I made it a block away from my street, and started walking on th sidewalk.  I knew practically the whole 5 mile radius around here, and there is a gas station that is open 24/7.  I had about 200 $ saved up, because just turning 16, not far from my house.

After about a 10 minute walk, i was done with my coffee, and decided to go back home.  The gas station was right next to a strip mall, so i walked through there to get onto a quicker path to home.

walking through, of feeling like i was the only one in the world.  I had passed through half of it when i was turning the corner, and i heard somethig.  a snap sounds out behind me, and i turn around ready to scream or run or fight when, they knock me to the ground.  I see stars and my head hurts like crazy from colliding with the pavement. he drags my to an alley behind two of th buildings.  They cover my mouth with there hand, and hold a knife to my throat.  I curse th tears of terror that start trickling down my face, for being too weak to fight.  He says to me, but i'd never get their in time.  I'm thinking this is how i'll die

 ill move ahead.  I wont get into details, and i wanted to save myself for the right guy, and this was definetly not the right guy.

once he's done with me he holds th knife to my face, leaving agony on my face.  He grabs my backpack, grabs my wallet, takes all my money, and checks my phone number.  He seriously got my phone number.  I hated him with everything i had, and he takes my FREAKING PHONE NUMBER.

He comes back to my, will you? because i'll hunt you down.  I swear to god if you tell anyone i will kill you.""

I nod feebly, and pull my pants back on.  I'll never forget those moments, seared into my mind forever.

After that i dont think of anything except to go home.  I walk all the way back before i realize what happened, to tell th cops every single detail.  

After about a month, therapy sessions every other day, until i get a text message from a blocked number.

""I told you i'd FUCKING kill you""

Back in the 1980's, so there were a lot of refugees and immigrant workers, some legal, some not. The one I'm talking about here is of the latter type. He was a manservant (that sort of thing was affordable to the middle class back then, and quite common) to a neighbour of mine, a kindly couple who owned a candy shop. I didn't know them well, but I used to pass by their store in the mornings and always said hello and they always smiled back; they also gave out extras when kids bought from them. Their son went to the same school as me. He was a nice boy. We never really talked, well-spoken


The manservant is another matter, 'go here', 'wash this', 'wipe this', and so forth, and he always looked at passing women with this leery, shifty-eyed glance. My mom always asked our neighbours whether they felt safe with him, there were frequent newspaper articles of these immigrants slitting employers' throats in their sleep and making off with their belongings. It's obviously not ALL of them and most were certainly decent folk trying to make the best of a shitty situation, smiled and said that he didn't have anywhere else to go and it would be heartless of them to turn him out


Naturally


Turns out that our neighbours were, whose mutilated corpse was found in the woods nearby a night before. Apparently he was also tortured before he died, and there were deep lacerations that cut straight to his bones. One of the neighbours was found with abrasions consistent with those of gotten from a struggling man trying to fight his way out of certain death; there were people who saw him buying ropes and saws the other day. We never knew if they were convicted or found innocent; my parents moved out to an overseas posting soon after that, and they were those ones who knew certain people and had a decent wallet, they could get away if they were guilty. They could've been innocent for all I know. And yes, in the intervening years, it would've been easy to find out how that turned out, but  I didn't want to go back there


There are no online newspapers that I can find, were certainly not in English. I'm sorry that I can't give you proof. And they may be innocent. I'm just not sure I want to find out, given how the law works in that country. In fact, I'm kind of nervous posting this on reddit even if I've changed enough details and it's been so long and I'm a citizen of a different country. Something like that sticks with you.
 

English is not my first language. Sorry if I made mistakes.

Two or three years ago, our attempts were laughably ineffectual. And here, out of nowhere, came this guy walking down the street with a shovel. He was African-American, maybe late thirties to mid forties, and perfectly friendly. His name was Charles, and he offered to dig us out of the snow. Us, felt we could hardly refuse--in fact

While he dug, trying to find people in our predicament whom he could help. He felt glad that he'd found us at the right time. When he'd finished, we thanked him with an unsolicited $5. He went off on his way and we went on ours.

About a week or two later, though my memory has honestly gotten pretty fuzzy on a lot of the details). It was afternoon, and we weren't expecting any visitors when there was a knock on the door. Puzzled, I got up to look behind the curtain on the door window. Charles was standing there, still smiley, and he gestured for me to open the door. I only opened it a little bit, my hackles suddenly up and alert.

""Hi

""Yes?"" I said

""Well, but do you have any money? I was going to get some beer, and I just don't have anything to pay for it. It's just a little bit, I just need enough for one case. Anything you have.""

At this point, but I honestly would have said the same thing no matter what. His nice-guy smile faded a bit, and he said he understood, thanks, and was on his way. Sarah and I laughed nervously, that was it, done.

Only it wasn't. Because shortly after that, and, when no one answered, she'd seen him peeking through the curtains. I heard him still knocking repeatedly while she cried under the blankets on our bed, and I told her that I would take care of her and called 911 on my cell phone. By the time the police arrived about 5 minutes later, the knocking had ceased and Charles had disappeared.

Epilogue: Several months later, was Charles -- and he'd been convicted at least once for aggravated sexual assault.

A large group of students from my graduating class in high school went to Hawaii for their ""Senior Trip"", and felt pretty safe the whole time, save for one night.

One night, exceedingly intoxicated girl I was at the time, I ask this ""really nice guy"" I had been talking to if he wouldn't mind WATCHING MY DRINK while I went to dance. 

Maybe 10+ minutes later, ""Aren't you going to finish your drink?"" 

I continue chatting, ""Your ice is melting, you really should finish your drink."" 

Even in my drunken and naive state

A few minutes go by with me still not having taken a single sip

I decided right then and there that it was time for a new drink. He got up and left. 


The same night, but after being politely declined (we were both ""good girls"" with boyfriends back home), they kept coming back and getting more and more vulgar and physical. I finally told them to get the fuck away from me or I'd have the bouncer throw them out on their asses. 

Jump forward a few hours. Everyone else I know has left except two of my friends. These friends want to go back and party with some locals at their apartment. I tell them that they're crazy and that that's how bitches get raped. They insist that they'll be fine. I let them leave (they had fun and returned safely). Only then do I realize that one of my friends had my debit card and cash in her purse, pleated skirts that were popular on teenage girls in the 2000s. 

Like an absolute idiot, at 1am, while the drunkest I'd ever been (6-7 mixed drinks in 3 hours in a 104lb body). Silly teenagers and their invincibility complexes. 

About four blocks from the club, I noticed one had a green baseball hat and plaid shorts on.

Road construction had been occurring in that area, something didn't seem right about the whole alley situation, so I immediately crossed the street and walked in the dark for two blocks, then practically sprinted the remaining blocks to my hotel.

A few days later

My mouth got really dry. I asked where she was

I got really dizzy and nauseous, had been beaten so badly several teeth were broken and both eyes were swollen shut. She had bruises and scrapes all over her body, and I believe her hand was broken. The girl who rode in the ambulance with her and sat with her at the hospital told me that Kristen remembered a green baseball hat. 

I ended up locking myself in the bathroom of my room and bawling for hours. They intended to get me

I never found out if they caught the bastards that did that to her. 


**TL, I walked 12+ blocks home and some guys pushed past me to wait in an alley for me to walk by. I crossed the street instead. Found out later that an acquaintance got pulled into the alley and raped/beaten by the same guys.**

I had recently turned 16, just because I could. It was early in the fall, so when I got there, it was still fairly light outside. I parked far from the entrance - still a little nervous about parking next to other cars. I can't remember what I bought. I can't remember if I bought anything at all. I may have just wandered around aimlessly for a while; teenagers are weird. Whatever the case, I know that, by the time I was walking out the door, it was well past dusk. 

I know now that I was stupidly overconfident. There were almost no cars left in the parking lot at that point; few mall-goers were enthusiastic enough to stay until 9pm on a Monday night. I began the long walk to my car by myself. Walking down the aisle, I thought nothing of it. I was walking rather closer to the center of the aisle than I needed to be, so I assumed that the car just didn't have enough space to get by me (in an empty parking lot . . .), and graciously moved over. 

The car didn't pass me. 

The driver continued at my walking pace of less than 3 mph, to go back and try to find mall security, because this creepy car was directly in my way. In my mind, my best option was to continue walking as though I didn't realize anything was weird, get to my car, and get the hell out of there. 

I kept walking

Finally, giving me away. Creepy car immediately zooms into the spot directly next to mine (on the passenger side of the car). I am in the car. I am closing my door as his door opens, and a hand reaches out and . . .

This happened last year -- in October

Anywho, as we're both college sophomores. I park in a parking garage that is about a 5-minute walk away from our dorm. Not very far at all. 

I parked on the 3rd floor, so everyone was in bed (or out drinking - 'Thirsty Thursday', waddup!), so the campus was unusually silent. 

As the elevator doors opened, 280lbs, muscular, and had that stereotypical look of ""I'm going to fucking murder you."" I didn't move, but, again - my girlfriend could have taken down an entire army of Nazi troops with the way she was feeling. She got on right beside him. I followed. 

We rode up to the 6th floor, how we liked school, etc. He was pretty decent. All the while I forgot to press the button of where we were supposed to get off, so instead we just rode the elevator up to the 9th floor - which was in the parking garage ""office"" sector. There were nothing but offices up there. 

My girlfriend and I awkwardly laughed about it. When we got to the 9th floor, and said he'd follow us down and make sure we got out okay. I suddenly got creeped out, and I could tell my girlfriend was, too, because she tucked herself behind me (I'm only 6'1"", 170-ish lbs, with the arm strength of SpongeBob SquarePants).

But instead of hitting the ""6"" button,"" but we had already passed the floor. So she reached out again, but the man grabbed her hand. His face had suddenly changed - he no longer smiled pleasantly or grinned courteously. The look of malice on his face will, until this day, haunt me. 

I intervened and pulled my girlfriend back. The elevator arrived on floor 3, but once we were in my car, he went off around a corner.

We drove to the campus security station (which was about a 1-minute drive from the garage) and told them what happened. It wasn't an hour later that they had caught the guy and arrested him. He was out on probation

Buuuut... that didn't stop my gf and I from making may a late-night trips after that. It freaked us out for a while,False,,t5_2t3t8,1359095990.0,,,t3_178s7j

The longer we lived there

At one point, and we were kind of afraid to head home. I realized I had seen this car drive through my apartment complex every night, and I had thought it was an unmarked cop on patrol, but now that I actually looked it was this beat up old Pontiac with tinted windows.

Okay so that was skeevy

But I looked out more. I found syringes on the ground on more than one occasion, but at the time it was scary). 

so, yeah no.

I had made friends with two girls who lived in the apartment complex, but I think this was before that. We had gotten a lot of snow that year, and still being kids, we were having a field day with it. snow ball fights and sledding and the whole shebang. 

One of the sisters I made friends with, especially these two since their house was a two minute walk away) and we decided we would go get her sister Lizzy and play a prank on her. We got a big bowl and filled it up with snow, and she went in and told Lizzy to come over to my house and come hang out. Then we hid under the stairwell right outside their door, but where she wouldn't see from the peep hole (Why we thought she'd look, I don't know), and we planned to throw the snow on her when she came out, but unfortunately we were in plain sight of the peep hole from another apartment.

apparently, and were talking about giving up and just going home because it was cold and I wanted to make snow cream. Then the door behind us opened and we jumped and turned around and apologized. We thought it was someone coming outside to leave for work or sit the garbage outside or something... It was some guy in his thirties or so, kinda unkempt and scruffy. The usual for the area, he was unremarkable and I don't remember what he looked like other than that.

He started talking to us, because he was so much older than us, but I had yet to get my hackles up. He told us he had this present for his nephew but he didn't know if he would like it, and since he was around our age, would we tell him if we thought he'd like it.

Definitely a little strange, thinking he'd go inside and get the toy and then come out with it. But no, instead he says, ""Okay, cool! come on.""  And walks out of the breeze way in front of the building. Okay, very weird, but maybe it's a bike or a sled and it's out front. We get out there

We literally took two steps and I just suddenly thought 'wow you idiot, you're going to get yourself and Blair raped and murdered, you're the older one here, do something.'

I grabbed Blair's hand and I knew she'd realized exactly what I had. We had both frozen like rabbits for what seemed like forever but must have only been a couple of seconds. I dropped the giant snow bowl and we sprinted all the way back to my building, and Blair actually had her hands up to her mouth and was about to cry. We immediately, STUPIDLY, decided we could never tell my mother (who was Blair's second mother pretty much, since her own was almost always drugged out) because I would be in SO MUCH TROUBLE if she knew what I had almost done. I should have said something, maybe something could have been done.

As I turned toward the wall to try to go back to sleep I noticed that someone was looking in my window. I don't think I was old enough to be freaked out by this because I don't remember feeling scared. The lady looked at me and made a motion for me to open my window.

As I have mentioned in my previous story, so did her bf. Our life was chaos. I didn't mind it- really, it wasn't loveless. But I had to be a grown up pretty much from the get go. Do the housework, fix my own meals. No one would make sure I'd make it to school, no one would make sure I'd be in bed on time,  I never had a routine, but I really didn't mind this as a kid. My grandma however was extremely critical of it. She often mentioned or suggested that she could take care of us, because as nice as she was, but what kid would decide against that? But I do think this helped my grandma with the courts.

From my sisters and my perspective at that time, only when we returned to Berlin ( It wasn't really uncommon for minors to travel alone, those days) our mum and her BF where nowhere to be found. We stood in front of locked doors ( the same doors of the previous story, I might add). 
We spend half the day waiting, my sisters went to stay with one of her friends- we told our grandma and made more attempts to contact our mum, but those were fruitless.

My grandma then offered to take us back. Which we didn't really want, it was surely the best solution. We didn't make it home for a whole year. They couldn't have known.

After a few days at my grandma
Our mum had let her know she would stay in Rome a few more days

When our mum returned home a week later and didn't find us there she called my grandma. What she heard on the phone was painful. My grandma told her that we didn't want to live with her anymore

Now here is the thing, she told us that our mum, (finally free of us!) decided that she ""had done enough"" and it was now ""someone else's turn"", that she didn't want us anymore and we were not to go back. 
Needless to say

As children we didn't know about all the things going on around it, she made up stories we supposedly have told about abuse/ sexual abuse in our family etc. I don't know what made her do all this, I guess she saw an opportunity and went with it. 

And this is how we came to stay with her and to see who she really was. 

Pretty much the minute she had custody of us
From her point of view our mum had ""tainted us""
At first it was mild stuff.. sitting us down to learn proper table etiquette, she just said ""use the other one"".

Every time we ""slumped"" we get hit. Pick our nose? Bam! Look bored?! Bam. 

It went from crazy, ranting saying she knows that we ""conspire against"" her, that she can tell our ""bad thoughts"" and she got ""bad thoughts"" too and if we wouldn't stop, she would be able to hurt us without touching us. Sometimes she just plain beat us up. Sometimes her punishments where weirder -like making us go shopping for small things an entire day ""one egg"", ""one apple"" ""one carrot"" until we were completely worn down.

We were in hell. Every night me and my sister hatched escape plans. But we were also stuck

And then the strangest thing happened after about a year, she eventually lost the custody battle and had to give us back anyway? But pretty much from one dreadful day to the next, we were on the bus back to Berlin. She attended the funeral and we were reunited with our mum - and our mum being reunited with us, we pretty much all just broke down. 

The funny thing is that actually it didn't come up at first

Later through other circumstances we learned that our mum was taken away from her and spend time in an orphanage
Our mum doesn't remember
We also found out that my grandma had once taken a 15 year old child (that wasn't hers) and our mum and traveled across the country with them until she was apprehended. I guess it's a sign of the times (late 60ies)

Epilogue of sorts. If you're wondering, so we decided to grand it eventually, being quite worn out from it all- it didn't last long. I have not been in touch or seen my grandma in over 12 years now. She has occasionally found us, and threatened us, but I live in a different country now, so I feel rather save. 

TL;DR- my grandma turned from the best grandma in the world into a living nightmare for me and my sister.

1346210613.0,z01lv,Inside the elevator with a dangerous creepy guy,,115,17,6,"When I was about 13 years old, not possible for kids to do that now). The area was not much developed at the time, even during the day as the lighting was artificial for the most part.

On a quiet Sunday afternoon, we just had to go back to our homes, as we had to ready up for class the next day. This time it just happened that I had to walk back alone. The street leading to my building was undeveloped for a long stretch, therefore both sidewalks where covered with tall bushes. That was the first time I realized my surroundings were a little menacing. I quickly walked by the middle of the road until I arrived to the end of the cul-de-sac where my building was located. 

The entrance was deserted. I opened the main door and entered the dark hallway to the elevators. When I get to the elevator door, tall, shady-looking man, inside the elevator (I am almost sure he also had some kind of deformity on his eyes or face). 

 I had never seen this person before. I doubted, to the parking garage. This was weird, as this guy was actually coming from the parking garage! From this moment on, I knew that  things were not right. I replied that I was going to the 12 floor instead, and I pressed the button #12 in the elevator control panel.  Almost right away this creepy guy pressed the button for the underground floor. Both buttons remained lit at the same time while the elevator doors started to close. My heart was racing fast at this point. I knew that if the elevator went back to the parking garage, things would get really bad. To this date, I am still thankful that the elevator went up! 

However, angry to the fact that the elevator did not went down.  He even said something like I would have to go to the parking lot with him! I was very scared. When the elevator opened up at my floor, I quickly tried to get off. This was when he tried to block my exit with his body!  I was quick to react and jumped out past him out of the elevator and ran to my apartment. Thankfully, at that precise moment, I saw my dad at my home main door. The creepy guy did not come out from the elevator. I was safe.

It was a cold December night, it was late, and I was tired. There were a few people in the underground station, but one of them stood out. He was a tall man, probably in his 40s, wearing an army green trench coat. I’ve seen some crazy people on the train, but just looking at this guy gave me a stomachache. He had these big

To make matters worse, but eventually he approached me. He was only a few inched from my face when he said, ""Hello my name is Gregory, would you like to go out on a date with me?"" Now, he did not say this with any emotion, punctuation or semblance of sanity. His voice was completely monotone and he awaited my response with empty eyes and a deadpan face. I said “No, thanks” rather quickly and nervously, all the while staring at me with his dead eyes until he reached the other side of the station. Crisis averted

Two years later, a face I never thought I would see again entered the café and was waiting in line. However, this time he was wearing a strange leprechaun-esque green hat, which added to the creep factor. There were about 6 people in front of him, and I could feel his eyes looking at me throughout their orders. Eventually, he came up to the register, ordered a coffee and said, would you like to go out on a date with me?"" in that same monotone voice and expressionless face. I said NO once more

I told my coworker (male in his 20s over 6’) that this guy really scared me, and call the cops if necessary. Later that night at closing time, I was mopping the floors. I stopped to look up, and there was Gregory. I dropped the mop, ran into the back room, and (half-crying and shaking) told my coworker. He ran outside, managed to scare him away and immediately locked the café doors.

This happened around 6 years ago. Me and my younger Sister (Claire) had just taken up tenancy of our flat off our Mom.
She had moved out after finding a new fella via the internet. Before meeting the next love of her life (who she is still with today) she had been dating several other guys, another who loved painting Warhammer figures for me given the chance and one who had many stories to tell. Good times.

But this being dating through the internet

A couple months after our Mom had moved out, when the phone rang and woke me up, it was about mid day. I worked 12 hour shifts at the time, days and nights, three on - three off. So understandably I wasn't too thrilled at being woke up from my slumber. I answered it and a guy on the other end asked for my Mother by name. I told him a probably a little bit of a harsh yet half awake tone that she no longer lived with us. He put the phone down without hesitation and I went back to bed without a second thought about it.

I few days later I was on my first day off so I had a chance to have a good chat with Claire. I happened to mention the phone call that woke me up, saying she didn't think much of it as Mom had not long moved out and probably forgot to tell a few friends. I gave Mom a call and told her about guy asking for her over the phone. Never once had I thought about asking for his name or checking for a number but she said to get either if not both when he next calls, so Mom can call him back. She didn't know of anyone trying to get hold of her.

Several days later I was home when the phone rang again, he seemed to get a bit frustrated. I asked for his name and number, so I could pass it on to my Mom and he hung up. I did 1471 (number recall) and got nothing, just time and date. 

A few weeks past without him calling again but we started getting someone calling every day but not speaking. We'd usually hang up after leaving it for about minute for a reply. I would try recalling the number afterwords but didn't get it. It went on for about a week till Claire had tried and surprisingly got a number. I was hesitant at first but decided to call the number using my mobile with number blocker on. No surprise that he didn't pick up. About half an hour later though

Our Mom wasn't to thrilled that someone was pestering us

We didn't get any calls for a while after that, so stop lying to me, bitch!"" This obviously scared the crap out of her, she hung up and called the police and her boyfriend who arrived about 10 minutes later. They couldn't find anyone watching the flat and gave a detailed account to the police, who gave us a number to call next time he rang. They took the number we had but couldn't investigate it unless they could directly link it to the recent calls we had been getting.

The next night I was home on the first of 3 rest days. After the indecent the night before I kept the landline near me. I was busy playing C&amp;C: TW when the phone rang. It was him. He was clearly angry and said ""You can call the police but they will never find me, as again they couldn't find anyone near by. But after searching, they parked facing our front door thinking maybe he hid away after hearing me calling the police, thinking he would return. 

We had been sitting in almost silence for what seem like forever when we heard a car turn up, stopped and used their mobile phone. They suddenly turned around and quickly walked back to their car and drove away. They stopped the car after it left our street and questioned the driver.

It was Alan. The reason he turned away and drove off was he couldn't get through to us on the phone. He thought we were calling the police again so he bolted. Me forgetting to hang the phone up properly stopped him from going 'all the way'. They found no weapons on him or in the car and they linked his phone and number we had to him.

1336141862.0,t6v96,"""THIS MAN IS AN ANGEL!""",ZoneQ,125,25,17,"I was once a young

I lived in a small town about 50 miles away from a large town (small city) in the NW US.  I would travel to the city with a group of friends every Friday night...but I didn't have a car.  So if I wanted to hook-up or hang out with a guy I would have to forgo my ride back and try to figure out how to get home the next day.   

Being drunk and horny were conducive to neither good decision making nor a well honed ability to tell if the guy I was hanging with was normal.  Which will lead to me to post more than once here...

So this guy...

Part 1: MARK - He was tall, and I shouldn't have been so impressed by this, he had had a bit part in a major 1980s motion picture staring Molly Ringwald. (That should be general enough, since every movie in the 1980s starred Molly Ringwald).  So I was impressed.

My friends approached me at the magic hour and asked me if I needed a ride home and I declined...the guy said he'd drive me and practically begged me to stay the night with him.

We went back to his place and he read me poetry and we ate chocolate and lounged on his HUGE bed. We had drunk awkward sex and fell asleep.  When we woke up the next day the weird started.  He said almost nothing to me.  I would try to talk to him and he'd grunt or say something very minimal and shut down.  He subjected me to this oddball silence for several hours of driving around running errands before he finally drove me the 50 miles to my house in silence.

I thanked him for the ride and noped out of the car as soon as he hit my driveway.

Part II: Several months later.

I was out and about again, caught my eye at about 4pm and I started talking to him.  We clicked hard.  I spent the rest of the drunk evening in various stages of grope with him.  He was all over me and I loved it.

Mark showed up and started talking to me.  He seemed normal

We travelled the 10 miles to the house and started having all sorts of party fun.  I was pretty popular that night.  Carlos and I continued to hit it off pretty well.

About 3 hours later there is a knock on the door.  It's Mark.  He has walked all the way from the bar to the house.  He is furious and storms into the house.  He physically attacks Carlos and I step between them.  He starts to cry.  I grab him and drag him out the back door and put him up against the wall.  

""What the fuck

""I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  I'm sorry!""  He's sobbing uncontrollably.

""What is wrong?"" I start to soften

""I thought we had something! We were perfect!"" 

""What?!"" 

""You and me.  We were perfect!  You never called!"" 

""You freaked me out.  You had my number?  Why didn't you call me?""

""I was scared."" 

I sit down next to him on the ground and he starts to calm down.  He starts to smile a bit and talk about how he was acting crazy.  Eventually

20 minutes later he attacks Carlos again and another guy forcibly grabs him to eject him from the house.

""I just want you people to know something.  You're all fucking losers!  You don't even hold a CANDLE...not even a fucking CANDLE to this guy

He punches a hole in the wall and leaves. 

I didn't see him again for several years.  He was working at a store in the mall.  He didn't seem to recognize me. for which I am grateful.

**TL;DR: I had a one night stand with this guy.  He freaks me out.  I don't contact him

On the way I stopped at a rest area somewhere in Indiana. I peed, the ""rode hard and put away wet"" look,  a little butch but seemed nice enough. While they were inside I got my map and was checking it over when they came back out. 

They asked me if I was lost. I told them I was not lost and had just about an hour left of driving. They started asking me more questions. Where I was from, if I had kids. This is when the little red flags started popping up in my head. Why would they be asking me so many personal questions right off the bat? Then they asked me if I was traveling alone. I told them that I was and that I was going to see my sister in law at Evansville. They then asked me if I had a dog with me in my vehicle. That was when I said ""sayonara"". 

I got into my car when one of the women tapped on my passenger glass. I cracked it and she said that I should follow them since they were going to Evansville also. I politely told them ""no thanks"". She said ""there are bad neighborhoods around, rolled up my window and drove off.

I loved exploring and being alone and this story is about the day when I realized that wasn't always the best idea. 

It's hard to explain how stubborn I am in general, then you should confront it and fight it! That was my motto I guess, at 6ish years old. I had run along cliffs and swam out father than I was supposed to where rip tides were known to happen and played in the street and went looking for strangers to meet (you can imagine my poor mother) but this day was the first time in my life that I had ever really felt a pang of real danger, or a tiny thrill of concern that something very bad might be about to happen. 

When church would let out on Sundays everyone would proceed to the courtyard or the offices or the kitchens to help, and play with the organ or stained glass. Sometimes I would sneak around in the back, trying to get out on to the roof or playing where the vestments were kept.

I turned around and saw this guy - maybe 20s to 30s, but casual and abused enough that even a younger me recognized that this guy was a little different. He greeted me warmly, as though we were good friends. I recognized that I had met him once before, in this very same room. He had introduced himself to me as people from the choir walked around us to put their things away. He had seemed a bit flustered at the time, and had mostly made small talk about things and then I left. I didn't remember his name or anything about him really, but I greeted him and was polite. There was no one else back here, the door on the other side was locked, so I wondered how he had gotten behind me without my noticing. I had gone all the way around when I first came in

He asked me if everything was okay, but that my parents were waiting for me (lie). The guy proceeded to say he was fine and then ask me for a hug, already coming in for one. I said okay because it was clearly going to happen anyway, and I didn't yet want him to realize how opposed to the idea of being near him I was. Now I wished that someone was here, anyone else, but especially another adult. I started to think about how unlikely it was that anyone would ever come in here, how far away everyone was, no one would hear me if I yelled.

His eyes were kind of slitted as he looked down at me. He was obviously considering.

So this was when I was like around twelve, I had better time calling him Dad than my own father. 

Stacie and her family were close, they had gotten divorce. I hadn't been over for a while since that. Actually, it had been a year since I came over. When I went over, I looked a lot different, longer hair, ruby red hair since my mom said I could dye it (my mom's laid back and pretty creative so she was all for it) and a big pair of ""nerd"" glasses. I had started to ""develope"" as well. Her father was naturally happy to see me and he asked me things about school, family, and life in general. Eventually me and Stacie went upstairs and goofed around going onto sites and such to fool around talking to strangers. (we couldn't be seen)  

Well we had passed out around midnight and I remember getting up around 2:00 a.m. to go to the bathroom and get a drink. When I went to get a drink

""Why are you up?"" He asked.
""I'm thirsty."" I responded.
""You know you are pretty light."" He said.
""Doctors say I am under weight
He nodded his head.
""I like your hair
""Thanks dad."" I smiled

I was able to fill my glass up like half way when I felt his arms go around my waist. I stopped the water real quickly and starred forward. ""W-What are you doing?"" I was able to stutter out. ""You really are beautiful."" He moaned, breath down it, touch it and let alone freaking lick it. So this was horrible. I flinched, making myself bend over the counter a bit. ""Feisty!"" He called, as I had shoved my butt into him. 

Luckily at this point one of Stacie's brother called for Dad, jumping into my blow up bed and hiding under the covers. I was so afraid he'd come up and try to go further. I remember before he let me go, though, he had ran his hand up my thigh PRETTY high. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night.

I never told Stacie considering I didn't want her to get mad at me

I had gone over her house often after that

I had the perfect ""bert voice"" as we called it and I was always the one put up to talk. One night we prank called a random number from my cool new cell phone. Normally people would laugh or get pissed and hang up half way through my script. We called a number and a man answered. I did my whole spill about how i was Anita Johnson and how i am looking for my boyfriend or some stupid stuff like that. Anyway the guy just went with it and played along until finally my throat hurt from my bert voice. I finally was just like dang i can't do the voice anymore dude we are 13 year olds and we gotta go. He insisted on talking and we ended up talking for a few minutes. I was kind of the chubby one so maybe i kept talkign to him because it was male attention. 

Anyway it turned out he lived out where i used to live and he was like a 40 year old man. He told me about how he has all this money and boats and a jet ski. Anway i ended up getting off the phone. The next day was the fourth of july and he called me to ask if i wanted to go out on his jet ski. He kept making comments about how he would go slow until i got comfortable but ""he really wanted to go fast because he wanted me to hold on to him tight."" I felt really uncomfortable and declined. 

He called or texted me every day saying he just wanted to talk or asking me to go eat or to the movies

 My dad took my cell phone and texted him telling him that ""I"" wanted to come over and watch a movie. He got so excited. He was creepy as hell

Back in college we heard about an all night event at a gay club. I'm not usually one for clubs, I agreed.

The whole building was filled with giggles, dancing and meeting new people, my roommate hopped up with a bunch of other people dancing on the stage. I followed and we were having a grand ole time until I looked out over a moving sea of people and saw one man standing still. *And staring straight at me.*

This man was probably 20 feet back in the crowd, so much as the stage, I shook my head and moved closer to my roommate; and by the time I looked back, he was gone. 

At this point, I see this smug looking bastard standing right in front of the stage and staring, with his hand outstretched. Seeing the hand still outstretched pissed me off and I smacked it pretty violently before backing away from the front of the stage. I moved to the other side of my roommate and as I was telling him what had happened, when I felt the hand again. *On the inside of my leg this time.*

This time

My roommate at the point is also yelling at this guy, but after a few minutes and with the promise of two extra eyes being vigilant, I hesitantly agree to stay. After all, I can't see this man anymore, and I'd been having such a great time outside these 5 minutes.

Not 3 minutes later, I've had more than enough.* 

As retold to me later by my roommate and the bouncer that was evidently half way over to me

**FLASH** - My face twisted in rage, just off the stage, this creep looking up in surprise. **FLASH** - My fist, and this strange man's nose, come together in a dark dance so powerful that I feel a pop.

A few seconds later, as my roommate calms me down. When the bouncer comes back, he says he saw the guy coming back, and he was trying  to head him off, but didn't make it in time.

When we actually went to leave

Even now I can so clearly picture a man; still in an ever-moving crowd.

As we split up to go to separate houses, and it just remained there. We joked for a moment. ""Imagine if it started following us,"" my friend said.

While I waited at the door of my next house, who had just ran up to me, very paranoid. 

We continued

At this point, and in that time, the car did not move. The car's lights were on. No one got out. 

After a few minutes, stopped, and its lights turned off. 

We decided to keep moving, and the car was still in the same place. We also noticed that the cars wheels were slightly pointing left, as if it were ready to turn around at any moment. 

Once at the end of the street, but it seemed like the man may have been looking in our direction. 

We panicked and quickly went back down the other street. Our manager called and told us that he sent someone else to come meet up with us. 

Before going to meet him, once more, we went back to check. The car was gone. We felt both relief and panic, as that meant the car could be anywhere. Then, we realized something. The car was not actually gone. It had turned around and was now parked on the other side of the street, facing toward us. 
 
With that, and went inside the nearest store.

1359261138.0,17cr50,I probably should have moved sooner,six727,118,18,18,"I had three creepy incidents happen over a few years at my old apartment that, too.


The first incident happened a few years ago.  I got home from work one night around 8.  It was a particularly cold night in February and it was extremely dark out.  At the time, like every night, I pulled into the carport in the back to park.  The house was on a corner lot.  To enter my apartment, I used a side door that was around the corner of the house.  


I grabbed my laptop bag, I heard a noise behind me.  I had my keys in my hand.  I had pepper spray on the key chain.  But I froze.  I had just enough time for my stupid brain to think, ""Please be a cat. Please be a cat. Whatever that is, it's moving too fast and too loudly to be a cat."" before I got slammed from behind.  My glasses were knocked off and I fell face first to the ground.  My laptop bag got ripped off my shoulder and whoever knocked me down tried to pull my purse off me, too. Because I had worn it across my chest and then fallen on it, he couldn't yank it off despite his repeated efforts.  As he ran away, I looked up and, saw his figure for a moment as he ran under a street light.  I screamed after him in this unreal voice I've never heard before from me and hope to never hear again.  


The police came to take my statement and helped me find my glasses.  I was actually sore for a day or two from tensing up so much in just those few seconds when I heard him running up behind me.  They never caught him and never recovered my laptop.  


I made sure that I left all three VERY bright security lights on any time I left my house.  My neighbors laughed at me for having the place so bright but I NEVER came back to a dark yard the rest of the time I lived there.  Knowing what I know now

A few months after that, people would occasionally cut through the yard and I assumed that was what was likely what was happening.  One night, just as she started growling, I quickly muted the TV and heard rustling in the yard.  I was terrified, but I didn't want to overreact and call the police for no reason.  I waited a good while and after hearing nothing, I put her on a leash (she's a pretty fierce looking pit) and stepped outside.  There were footprints in the mud under the window that looked into my living room.  I had those bamboo slatted blinds so I couldn't see out, but I realized that you could see in perfectly at night when the lights were on.  I'm certain someone had been watching me and it had probably been going on for some time.  At this point, right?  I bought some of that film for my windows so it was impossible to see in


The last incident happened some time later.  I woke up at 3 in the morning to my dog barking furiously.  Again, I jumped out of bed and ran to the windows in my room (upstairs) that easily looked down into my back and side yard.  I saw nothing.  After a few minutes of watching, I turned on the lights in my room and waited for a bit, continuing to watch.  When I was sure that no one was hanging around, I went downstairs to double check that things were ok and they were.  The next morning, however, I took my dog outside and noticed that someone had broken the cover of the telephone box on the side of the house where the phone lines enter the house.  Someone had definitely been in my yard and they were obviously trying to damage the phone lines.  I filed a police report and decided I didn't want to be afraid anymore.  I broke my lease and moved out not long after that.


The last incident at this place did not happen to me, grazed in the neck by a bullet.  She attempted to get away and ran towards the back yard and the man followed her, shooting her in the knee.

1356722290.0,15l3b4,Gut instincts are your friend. Sort of. ,yudkev,124,29,9,"Age: 22. Deserted (at the time) college town. 

I feel the need to get this story out because it may not be the content that bothers me so much to this day but the inexplicability of it. This happened over the summer and I'm currently alone in the same house seeing as my roommates

I had just returned from studying abroad and was initially excited to have a house to myself. The first few days involved some porch beer and redecoration, overlooks a motel on the other side of the intersection along with some other old houses. As I was sitting on my porch around 1 or 2 in the morning I first notice the same car circling my block and repeatedly passing my house, as well as a middle-aged man on a bike. I assume 2 AM biking of this sort is drug related and my county is known for its property crime, poverty, and drugs. This results in a whole lot of break ins to student housing during the holidays, which is what my initial paranoia was about. 

I ended up calling the non-emergency line and reporting the car that I had now seen every few minutes for the past hour. The officer who extended his patrol stopped at my fence and informed me that tonight must be one of those nights that the motel was being used for crack sales. Apparently drug dealers are known to check out entire hallways at a time and there's not a lot anybody can do about it. This explained the ridiculous traffic in and out of the motel and perhaps the surveillance car

This whole week was marked with a lot of sketchy dealings that I observed from my porch.  I think whatever tendency of mine is responsible for that is the same one behind my interest in this subreddit. It's pretty masochistic given my horrific phobia of home invasions. 

All of that is the context for the next night. Despite my weeklong bout of mild paranoia, I found myself thinking about how nice rain would be. Though it hadn't rained and wasn't supposed to rain again for weeks, I randomly peel back the blinds of my bedroom window that overlook the street, porch, and our crappy tiny wooden gate. 

The second I do that I see a man opening said gate and stepping into my yard. He wasn't staggering like he was drunk, jeans, and a navy baseball cap. He looked completely calm and purposeful, hands in his pockets like he lived there and had just stepped out to his car for a second. He wasn't glancing around or hesitating, just making his way towards the porch stairs. He didn't have any bags on him so if he was intending to burglarize, he'd be limited to whatever would fit in his pockets. 

I don't really remember what I was thinking beyond the immediate ""seriously? now?"" but instead of hiding under my bed with an Ikea knife and my stungun as I always assumed I'd do in this situation I bolted out of my room in my pajamas (possibly just an oversized t-shirt) and swung open the front door and yelled ""fuck off."" 

It was probably the surprise of someone having noticed him rather than my menacing 5'2 stature and fighting words

So much of this remains very unsettling to me, and I hate that I'm so curious about what he would've done next. Wrong house? Possibly. But I feel like if I had just scared the shit out of a tiny girl I would've apologized or at least been surprised that I wasn't at the right house. He looked like he knew he wasn't supposed to be there and how calmly he gave up suggests it wouldn't be too inconvenient to try again. I wonder if he lives in one of the other two houses on the hill that, despite the college neighborhood, seem to house a bunch of middle-aged men who never leave the porch. 

I've always hated that girls are taught to be suspicious and on the defense if they're alone. It's not right (for either gender) to have to account for the possibility of every stranger on the sidewalk being a rapist or worse. But for some reason this incident awakened every irrational paranoia of mine like that. It doesn't help living in a place like this with so many unsolved stranger assaults, but this event marked the point that my feeling of safety vanished, and nothing even had to happen. Yet now pretty much every sound outside my window is that gate opening. Some of these stories here definitely embody my worst nightmares and I'm hoping I won't ever have to post a similar follow-up.

Passenger age 20  Gender: Female


It was late in the 20th century and life was good. Me driving an original paint job and interior 1970 Camaro SS tipped the scales for driving fun. I was a happy guy. Sure I have had an unusual life if you have read any of my stories

It was July of the year and very hot in Southern California the day we took off for Vegas.  Cuing the stereo

All was going well in our drive as the temperature soared to very hot from hot and we made our way along Interstate 15 North.  If you have driven this road, the shimmer of mirage came off the road. 

I didn't overexert the car but soon noted a warning light on my dash cluster.  I smelled something sweet and burnt.  Transmission fluid!  Not really so flammable

I let my passenger know what was going on and said we needed to find a place to pull over.  On this incline that was a non option

As we came to the top of the incline

The thing is

It did not take long to find that the pan gasket for the transmission was leaking badly.  I popped the front hood and measured the dipstick.  No liquid showing.  Not good.  What I did not have with me was fluid and a gasket.

I spoke with the man and asked about a parts shop.  I had tools with me in the trunk.  He was long on slow talking but seemed a decent enough guy just hanging out in a closed desert diner/gas station.  He said the nearest place for parts I needed was Las Vegas. 

I was distressed and this was before cell phones were common to everyone.   Corona didn't even have the row of dealerships along the highway then.  I went and spoke with my passenger.  There was no working payphone and no means to get any help.  The old man was the odd thing here as he got there somehow

In a few minutes a Dodge Ram Pick-em-up truck appeared.  It was white with a rear cap that flared up in the back and gold flamed stripes on the sides.  The man drove up and parked.  He got out of his truck and stood about 5'10 and was maybe 60 with a head of white hair

The man walked over to the old man and they talked for a bit and the old man gestured at us in a friendly way.  The man seemed jovial and walked over toward us. He introduced himself as Mike

Well, we would be grateful. He asked if we had any money.  I told him I had about 40 dollars for gas and was going to get money there and had to get more due to parts. I offered to pay him 60 dollars for his trouble. He laughed and said that was more than enough and we three piled into his truck.  

All went well on the drive to Vegas and we had small talk. When we reached the city

We arrived to drop off my passenger and I stepped in with her for a brief bit and her parents paid me 300 dollars.  A lot more than I expected and that was more than I made in a weeks pay.

So when I went back to Hoss' truck he gestured friendly-like that I jump in.  I did.  He asked how it went and I told him they paid me a lot more than I ever expected. He seemed to brush that off and suggested we get a beverage before getting to the parts store.  

It was a 7-11 and I offered to get him a soda.  He thanked me and I hopped out and got us each a Super Big Gulp

Hoss said he knew where the parts store was and would take me there

In a short while he turned off a main road and started down a dirt road with nothing but a very distant something. I asked why we were on the dirt road. He said ""Short Cut"".

At first this made some sense but the road turned slightly away from the distant buildings. We were in the middle of desert.  I was feeling uneasy but stayed firm as Hoss asked me just how much I was paid. 

I was holding my drink and took a sip and replied

Hoss slammed the brakes and reached his burly arm really fast around my neck and shouted

I had gotten the element of surprise and won my freedom.   Hoss yelled out profanities at me and I yelled my suggestion of his body being better buried here by me.  With that he stepped on his accelerator and tore away from me.  I was okay and he was driving madly away

I chose a direction that seemed to be closest to me and started walking.  I have no idea how long it took but by the time I was nearing my goal it shone as a new set of homes. I was sweating horribly and ready to just drop. I was mad.  I mean

As I got closer to the nearest home I saw a man standing there who was dark haired and lean.  He was just watching me walk out of the desert in black.  I walked toward him and as I got into earshot

I gave the tl;dr and asked again for water.  His garage was open and he grabbed a cup and ran some water into it from the spigot for the hose. He reached it to me and I greedily took it and guzzled. 

As I was in shade

I explained what Hoss had done and asked them a favor of picking me up.  They agreed

Some time later they arrived and picked me up.  I thanked the man for his kindness as many could not survive unprepared in the desert.  I was lucky to be close enough to someone.  He said not everyone is a bad person.

I was taken to a parts store

A while later the bus arrived and I got aboard.  I asked the driver to stop in Barstow.  Sitting back I reflected on what had happened and suddenly realized I was alone and that psycho knew where my disabled car was in an abandoned place.  It was not a safe place to be

Barstow was close enough to where I was going but not close enough to walk.  I later found out I could have asked to get off at that exit since it was a real exit off the highway.  Live and learn.

So

He was a war vet with non working legs. He had special crutches by him.  He said he could take me to where my car was as it was on his way.  He was driving a 5th wheel truck hauling cars.  I must have looked him oddly as he laughed and said,""whoever this Hoss guy is, you are probably better off with someone keeping watch when you fix your car.""  I know my eyes lit up with that as it was a huge concern to me and I thanked the man.

In a short while we headed out and true to his honor he waited as I replaced my gasket

The old man at the store was gone. The sun was waning in the sky and my car was fixed.  I thanked him again and he told me

We both headed out at the same time and I made my way home.

I closed my eyes and started counting ""1...2...3...4"", when a much louder, deeper voice joined in, ""6...7...8...9. I can see you"". I knew this voice wasn't my friends and knew it was someone bad. I opened my eyes and looked up towards the field, I could vaguely make out a figure through the bushes - it was definitely a man and he was looking down at us. At this stage I didn't know where my friends were but assumed they had heard him to. 

Now, telling us he is going to get us and we're trapped. I decided I had no choice and I'd make a break for the exit that is closest to a main road. I grab my bag and start running. My friends must have seen me and start running in the same direction, although I am back of the group as they were hiding closer to the exit. He sees us running and heads to cut us off. We get out of the creek via a small bush path that enters onto a small carpark before hitting the main road. As soon as I hit the carpark I feel a tug on the back of my bag. Hes got me. As I hit the ground an elderly looking lady, who must have just walked around the corner from the main road, yells at him to get off me and he immediately runs away, back across the field. 

The lady made sure we were okay and asked us if we wanted her to escort us home. We all decided we were fine and headed home. I didn't tell my parents or the police. We just left it. Looking back,,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,True

Back in 2009 my family and I took a vacation with some distant relatives to Ireland. There, I always tried to see the best in people. I unknowingly befriended strangers without questioning for one second if they were safe or not. 

I was the youngest person in the cottages with my family and bored out of my mind. I wanted to make friends with some Irish kids and being an innocent 13 year old, I saw a boy who looked around my age playing with a soccer ball and a field hockey stick in the field behind the cottages' backyard. I yelled to him, asking him what he was doing and if I could join him. He said I could play with him and so I quickly found my way to the field. May I note that I've been playing soccer since I was 4 and was quite good at it. 
We talked a little, and kept my concerns to myself. 
I don't even remember his name. 

While we played, I really didn't have a chance. This is where my memory gets blurry, I just remember that we stopped playing soccer and he was holding down my limbs, trying to prove he was stronger than me. I told him that he was and that he had won. He wouldn't stop. I tried running away from him but he kept on catching me and taunting me about how weak I was. I was scared, this guy wasn't letting me go. Next thing I knew I was on the ground, and he pinned me down. He was right on top of me, his face inches away from mine. I tried to stretch my neck away from him

All this time, told him that my cousin wanted me to go back home and ran as fast as I could. 

I never saw him again during the trip
I never told anyone, I get a little freaked out.

Some backstory: I met my ex-husband 9 years ago when I was 16 and he was 19. We had gone to the same high school together, how you been?"" or anything like that, were ""Hey jlmoyer17, you got hot since I seen you in school."") I end up going with him back to his parents house and sleeping with him the next night(I was young and stupid and 16, OK?) and thinking the whole thing is probably just a one night stand anyways. 


The next morning I wake up, has always loved me and used to wish he could ask me out when we were in school, used to ""follow"" me around when we were in school(knew who my friends were, what I liked, etc.) and asked if I would go out with him, then started weeping that if I didn't go out with him he would be devastated and so on. So, I said yes.(I chalk this up to the fact that I had just had a horrible break up with my previous abusive boyfriend 4 months prior and was still pretty emotionally damaged. So
We end up dating. 3 weeks later he asks me to marry him one night after we'd finished a romp in his bed. Not really what I envisioned a proposal to be like, I'm his fiance', I should move in with him(I'm still in high school btw and he still lives with his parents) and so on. I also find out from his sister that he HAD been ""stalking"" me when he was in school. He had all these notebooks he'd written in about me, he had clothes that he wrote my name all over in sharpie and safety pins. I'm kinda weirded out by his behavior at this point but don't think anything of it and brush it off, choosing instead to think of it as ""cute"".


Fast forward a few years:
I get badgered into moving into his bedroom with him at his parents house after I graduate high school, but gets pissed if other guys look at me or he thinks I'm looking at other guys. He will at times accuse me of ""looking loose"" or ""like a whore"" because of how I dress. At one point he tells me that he's a ""real live vampire"" and has the urge to drink blood, but instead smokes all the time to stave off the ""urge"". He tells me he used to have 2 inch long canines, but that someone broke them when they hit him in the face with a baseball bat. On several occasions he makes me sit still while he cuts my arms and licks my blood. He constantly gets into fights with his parents, screaming and throwing things at each other. His parents also constantly get into fights and scream and throw things at each other. Mostly they fight about their ""swinger parties"" that they have once a week.


His parents end up getting divorced and his mom keeps the house we are living in. I'm now subjected to walking in on her with random dudes every day when I come home from work. She had no sense of bedroom privacy and would screw her random encounters on the couch, bathroom, etc. Fun times. I'm trying to convince my ex-husband that we need to move out and get our own place. We've been living with his mom for 3 years and I think enough is enough. He constantly makes excuses, saying we don't have the money usually. His mother also doesn't want us to move out, but instead thinks that we should get married and live in the basement of her house. ""It would be like your own apartment!"" she says. Eventually, we do get our own place, but only after I have done all the work of finding and securing it and borrowing money from my parents for the security deposit. I'm unhappy in my relationship at this point in my life and I convince myself that if we can get away from his mother


Things do get better after we move out, he has continued to pressure me about getting married. I wanted to wait, because in the back of my mind I wasn't sure about marriage, but he asks and asks and finally I give in and we end up going to the district court and getting married. Not really the ideal wedding I had envisioned, but I let him talk me into it. His behavior hasn't improved at all over the past few years, with him still acting like he's 19 and immature. He can't hold down a job for very long and I'm the one paying to support us both. He frequently spends money on stupid things that we don't need such as guns for himself ""to practice shoot"" and toys for himself(remote control helicopters, magic tricks, fancy lighters


We end up buying a house together and moving an hour away from my family and friends,000 Jeep, a motorcycle, more guns, etc. He constantly harasses me for sex every single day, multiple times, usually making me feel bad if I tell him I'm not in the mood. Often times, ""was that good for you
Last year


The day I end up telling him, he follows me to work and screams at me to talk to him while I'm sitting in the parking lot. I try to tell him I don't want to talk right now and he ends up pushing me into a fight, at the end of which I end up screaming at him, ""I want a divorce!"" He reels back, shocked and yells at me some more. We end the ""discussion"" with him screaming in my face, ""well, I hope the next guy treats you like shit, is that we work in the same store together, alcoholic, [PCOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCOS). Nothing that would affect my ""mental stability"". 
We spend the next 2 weeks with me sleeping downstairs and him upstairs in the bedroom. I avoid him as much as possible because he still maintains that I ""need serious help"". I frequently wake up in the night during these 2 weeks to find him standing over me, but I didn't want to leave my dog and 3 cats with him alone and I was afraid he'd hurt them if I left. Then the night comes that changes everything. 


It's about 11pm and I'm sitting in my kitchen, ""fine, I'm going to my parents"" and pack a quick bag with some work clothes in it and text my friend that I've had an argument with Mike(my ex) and am leaving my house. He tells me to text him in 20 minutes to let him know that I'm OK. As I'm in the bathroom getting my toothbrush and things, he decides he doesn't want me to go and starts yelling at me that I can't leave.


He traps me in the bathroom and I yell at him to move. He refuses. I put my hand on his chest and push, and he yanks me forward, causing me to trip and drags me through my house to the stairs that lead to the 2nd floor bedrooms. I regain my footing but he yanks me forward again and I smash my head into the side of the wrought iron railing. He takes this opportunity to get behind me and starts pushing me up the stairs while now screaming, ""I'm gonna show you how much I love you, you bitch! When I'm done loving you, you won't want to leave me!!"" I'm now terrified that he's going to rape me if he gets me upstairs and my survival instinct kicks in. I get my feet planted on the step almost level with my head and push back as hard as I can, successfully knocking him backwards into the wall and onto the landing behind him.


I slip out of his grip and grab my bag and turn to run out the door when I realize, grabbing my keys out of it before I can. He runs back upstairs still screaming, ""I'm gonna show you how much I love you! You aren't leaving me, you bitch!"" I'm panicked by now and digging for my phone when he comes back downstairs with one of his handguns and points it at me. Seeing that, I completely freak, scream at him that HE'S the crazy asshole and bolt out of the house, deciding that I'll walk to my friends house and maybe he can give me a lift. He follows me outside and throws my keys at me and runs back inside. I grab them, because he'd had a bad feeling when he didn't hear from me. I break down, my ex is a tall, punk-rocker type guy who had a green belt in Karate). I also told him no

My ex decides he's leaving the house and goes to stay with his mom, calling every day and weeping to my mother and saying nasty things about me to my brother. My brother actually goes to confront him one day and ends up having my ex's crazy mother come after him with a frying pan, screaming that she was going to kill him and my whole family. My father finally put an end to all that with a phone call to their house. I heard later that he told Mike and his mother that if they didn't knock off the BS, there would be a day where they would have an ""accident"" on their way home from work and that no one would ever find the bodies.(My dad worked for the government for 35 years and can be scary when he wants to be).

 Things quiet down for awhile and Mike leaves me alone. I go through the process of filing for divorce papers and Brian(my friend) is my main support group since I don't know anyone else out where I live. He routinely checks up on me, talking in my kitchen, when my ex shows up without warning. I jump up and ask what he's doing here. He doesn't say anything to me, instead pushes me out of the way and starts screaming at Brian how he's a bastard and this is all his fault and he shouldn't be in ""his"" house. Brian calmly stands up and says he's allowed to be there since I've invited him and that my ex needs to calm down. Mike starts screaming that he needs to ""GTFO or he's calling the cops"" and reporting Brian. My ex grabs my phone off the kitchen counter to call the police and I jump and try to grab it away from him. He grabs and twists my arm, then throws my into the fridge. This sets Brian off(his dad abused his mom when she was alive and he can't stand men who treat women like that) and he grabs my ex, lifts him off the ground and slams him into the wall, screaming at him that if he ever touches me like that again

Eventually, because I'm afraid my ex will come back. He does, and amps up his visits since my ex still has keys to the house. I don't hear anything from him(my ex) for a few more weeks, but have this strange feeling every once and awhile when I'm home alone. I start noticing little things out of place when I come home from work(my ex had quit his job at the store where I worked so I didn't see him there every day). One day, my fears were confirmed when I came home and found the alphabet magnets on my fridge had been rearranged to say ""Balls to U. I C you."" which scared the crap out of me. I then noticed that his handguns were gone as well. He had left the case open and on my bed for me to see. My ex had been watching my house and coming in when I was gone! I eventually got his sister to get his set of keys from him, but I was still scared that he would show up again. Things calmed down though and the weeks went by and I finally got the papers signed(his sister helped me with that as well) and he shacked up with some 42 year old woman(his mom is 46 btw). After the papers were finalized he pretty well left me alone, except to text me now and again to see if I wanted to ""hook up for old times sake"" to which I always respond, but I'm happy I went through with it and didn't let him talk me into staying in that horrible relationship with him. Looking back
I'm sorry this was so long to read

**TL;DR Had an 8 year relationship and married a guy who tried to rape and kill me when I finally filed for divorce.**

I smiled tentatively. ""Yes?""

As I was browsing through the stacks of records, I spotted it: a rare Beatles album. It was in my price range and I brought it to the counter. The owner and I continued making small talk while he rang up my purchase, when the bell rang to announce a new customer entering the shop. We both looked up and my smile faltered.

Rental prices in Australia are crazy to say the least so Sarah took to a site called GumTree which is an Australian version of Craigs List. After looking through a few properties Sarah finally found a nice townhouse owned by a middle aged woman who lived there alone. The townhouse was beautiful

Sarah moved into the property two days later and began enjoying her new home. As she worked long hours she didn’t see much of her housemate apart from the occasional times when they’d both decide to watch some late-night TV together. Everything seemed to be going fine until Tuesday night came around. Sarah was upstairs reading when she heard a blood-curdling scream from outside, someone help me!” She threw down her book and looked out her window towards the tram tracks but saw nothing, no baby, no screaming woman and no tram. She waited in her room and concluded that if someone had indeed been hit she would have seen a tram and there would be a lot of sirens by now. 

Sarah didn’t get a chance to ask her housemate about the screaming woman she heard that Tuesday night until a few days later. When she finally did ask her housemate about the screaming woman she explained that there was an old woman who lived across the road who was a little crazy and would sometimes start screaming out random things. Later that day as Sarah was sitting outside her housemate came up to her, hunched over and waddling slowly to her front door dressed in moth-balled rags. 

Two weeks past and each Tuesday night Sarah heard the old ladies cries about someone being on the tracks. Sarah, he’s on the tracks! Quick, quick, he’s been hit!” rather than continue to ignore this she decided to see if she could catch a glimpse of the old lady screaming. She ran down the stairs and to the front of the house, peering out the window across the road to see the decrepit old woman wailing. She looked out the window towards the old woman’s house and saw her too standing at her front window looking out from behind the curtains not screaming but looking to for where these cries were coming from. Confused Sarah stepped back from the window and listened to the screams, it was then she realised that they were actually quit loud. As she followed the sound of the screams she came to the backdoor of her house, opening the door she found her housemate standing in the backyard screaming, eyes glazed over looking as though she was in a trance. Sarah froze staring at her crazed housemate who seemed oblivious to her presence even looking directly at Sarah but not really seeing her. The housemate continued to wail while Sarah looked on in shock. Finally Sarah snapped out of her frozen state and ran back to her room

When I was 14 we went on a school camp in a National Park with an organisation called Outward Bound who operated camps in the area, it was all very fun for the most part.


Our guide was a guy called Anthony who was very funny, we sat around the campfire and he told a whole lot of ghosts stories, so as a bunch of young kids we were really spooked, but then we finished up with everyone telling jokes so we all went to bed pretty relaxed.


So we were lying in our tent that night, a few steps then a pause... a few steps and a pause... I whispered to James, he'd hear it too but maybe it was just one of the our friends taking a pee.


After a while it got closer, and then the tapping started. Just a gentle intermittent tapping on the outside of the tent, by this stage we were scared but we'd resolved it was just Anthony trying to freak us out, so we ignored it for a while, until the whispering started.


There was a creepy voice, as I was genuinely freaked out and yelled ""fuck off Anthony its not funny!""


The tapping stopped and the footsteps moved away


We walked out of the tent, that wasn't funny man""...


Anthony looked puzzled, he said obviously no one would get in any trouble, but if no one owned up he needed to contact his supervisor. He got on the walkie talkie, we hiked to the nearest road and got picked up (it was the last day anyway). They called the police, we submitted a report but I didn't hear any more of it. From what i could gather from their reaction to the whole thing, it wasn't the first report of such an occurrence, but they didn't want to let a lot on, I haven't heard anything of it since.

Well. The story begins earlier this year.  I had just turned 21 and lived in Manhattan with my only friend and companion, I was having difficulties at my shitty retail job with a co-worker who was a bully, and my depression got worse and worse. The first time I went down to the subway tracks and stared at them, I knew it was time to go home.

So that's background info on how I ended up in an intensive outpatient program for depression and bipolar disorder, but the ones relevant to the story are that I had horrible boundaries with people and extremely low self esteem, among many other pervasive issues.

Ok. Enough Background. So I get to my group therapy and I've got two therapists, trying to get inside my head and make me see things in ways I hadn't before. And when I would talk about my low self esteem and feeling ugly some days, everyone in the group would comment on how great I was, beautiful inside and out, the usual things support groups do. But Jim was the loudest. The most reassuring.

Fast forward to my last day of the program. I was so ready to leave and never look back. Jim had other plans.  He pulled me aside after the last session and looked into my eyes and told me he'd like to keep in touch. He gave me his business card. I took it, he'd like to see me outside of ""this shit box for a drink"", and showed me the scars on his arms from where he had tried to slit his wrists, telling me we were very much the same. And then he made me hug him. It was not optional. He was huge and I am not huge. Not much room for escape.

I have never been more uncomfortable in my life. I tried to rush the goodbye and bolted, and tried to move on. 

I go to target with my mother

I saw my individual therapist later that day and told her everything.  She called the center. I filled out a formal complaint.  I don't know what happened to him.

It's really upsetting though because he took advantage of my circumstances and it feels like he preyed on my weaknesses. I felt I had learned enough to move on with my life from that program and after this incident it all seemed so fake and useless. Like I was being fed lines the entire time. It was such a shame.

After work

As I was about to enter the library, with a lighter skin tone, and had kind of a big forehead and buggy eyes.

To really paint this story for you guys, overweight, and had long curly hair and a beard.

Anyways, the library is right next to a giant clock tower.  Also, this guy was wearing a watch (I was proud of myself for noticing these details, but shortly you will see how my detective skills failed me completely when I needed them.)  However, I told the guy the time, and just kept along my way.

I headed into the elevator in the library (the computers were on the 3rd floor), he stops me again.  And he proceeds to make one of the strangest requests I've ever heard.

He tells me that he is part of a program that sends high school students to our University (this was actually feasible, and he was asked to approach a stranger, and see if the length of his foot was equivalent to the length of his forearm.

This guy already is giving me the creeps, ""Science Class.""  I tell him that this is college, and there is no such thing as Science Class, and I proceed to walk away.

He follows me and bothers me once more.  He says

Now, and I just want to check my e-mail in peace.  Further, I have not made the oh so important connection that this guy is a foot fetishest at this point.  So finally, to shut the little bastard up, I tell him, ""Fine."" 

So we go to a corner in the library, he asks me to take off my shoe.  At first I'm about to protest the he just said I could leave my shoes on, but at this point I just want him to fuck off.  So I do so.  

He proceeds to just stare at my foot, I just grab my shoes, and run barefoot out of the cafeteria.  I actually run up to the fifth floor, in case he tries to follow me (I figured he would naturally assume I was going to leave). 

I went the rest of the day and didn't encounter him again.  

I could end the story at this point

And as luck would have it

Some time later (maybe a few months), I believe), and, most importantly, saw his AOL Instant Messager Screen Name.

I told him I was a sorority girl, and I spent a few conversations just building a rapport with him.

Finally, and proceeded to give a very long list of fetishes.  I stuck the word feet in the middle of this list of maybe 10 things (ex: animals, bondage, wax, feet, clowns etc...).  

And he isolated my one example of feet.  He replies with

In our next conversation, this guy must be an idiot, because I probably did the most cliched job of pretending to be a sorority girl).  This guy at the party said my online friend was a freak who used to harass people and look at their feet on campus.

The creep at this point responded with the most bizarre response ever.  He said something along the lines of

""What?  I only did that once, and his feet were so nasty.  I didn't even want him to take his socks off [to be fair, my feet did probably smell like shit after my work shift.]""

I think at that point

Eventually the creep started becoming a regular at the cafeteria I worked at.  But

I realize this isn't as scary as some of the other posts on here

(24 female now)

When I was around 16-17 years young my friends and I would go to this country dance ""club"" called the Country Barn

Anyways, play pool, and have fun. When slow songs would come on all the guys would ask all the ladies for a dance. It was pretty adorable. It was locally owned by an older couple who were extremely nice and good Christians. They had a son who was about 26 if I remember correctly, his name was David. He would never ask anyone to dance and would occasionally play with the band playing his guitar. 

After about five visits to the Country Barn my friends and I noticed that David would watch our group dance. Near the end of the night at the last slow song David approached me and asked for the last dance. My friends were all giggling because they thought David was the cutest thing they'd ever seen so I accepted. Before I left he asked me if he could call me so I gave him my number. Stupid me. 

About a week later my best friend Bethany and I are at my house around 3 am having a sleep over and just talking when my cell phone rings. Odd enough at 3am

Over the next two weeks I keep getting call/voicemails like that and just ignored it out of disgust, yet, and I tell him so. ""no, you have. I just don't say much because I get nervous on the phone. I love the sound of your voice, though"". Okay. So I say ""that's been you calling me from 3-7 in the morning?"" and he smiles and nods like its the most normal thing ever. At this point my friends are walking to the pool table because they're feeling ""awkward"" (thanks, ladies. I'm feeling peachy right now, don't worry!) so I politely tell him, I don't think we should talk on the phone anymore. It makes me uncomfortable"" all of a sudden he looks extremely pissed off and walks away while saying ""well fuck you then

Bethany practically lived at my house back then. School nights/weekends, David, so I put it on speaker and say ""David, this isn't funny. Please stop calling me"" and then bethany and I both look at each other with disgust as we hear a woman moaning saying things like ""oh, fuck me harder"" ""oh David!"". Ew. So I hang up and try my best to sleep. Calls like that happened nearly every weekend for about four weeks. I stupidly ignore them yet again hoping they'll stop on their own. 

About three weeks after the last call my friends begged me to take them back to the Country Barn. I obviously said no multiple times but gave in once Bethany suggested that since the calls stopped David must be out of town. Teenage logic

Half way through the night the girl who came in with David approaches me as I'm getting a mountain dew from the concession stand. ""hey I'm Brittany"" 
""hi there
""I know. David has told me all about you. He's mine now so stay away from him and STOP trying to break us up or I'll beat your ugly ass!""
This didn't set well with me for multiple reasons. One, I don't take to well being threatened. So I replied ""I never talk to David. He's too old for me and he's bat shit crazy in my opinion"" 
""yeah well I'm 14 and gave him my virginity so I'll be damned if some old woman will take him away from me!""
....I'm only 16-17

As we're walking to my car David runs out and says ""Tiffany, just yuck. I get in my car lock the doors and leave. When I get home I tell my dad everything. He's a little pissed at me for ""talking"" to a 26 year old but more pissed at David and worried for the crazy little 14 year old. 

Turns out my dad knew the owners pretty well and went to their house to have a talk with them. David had been living in one of their rental homes for a few months and a runaway (Tiffany) was living in the basement without anyone's knowledge but David. David's family paid the little girls mother a whole bunch of money to keep it quiet, if someone hit my child and slept with them. Morons). David's father promised my dad he would take care of it and it wouldn't happen again. My Das figures David will get his ass beat and possibly go to jail and that'll be the end of it. Wrong. David got to go to Europe for a year on mommy and daddy's dime so he would ""cause anymore trouble"". I don't know where David is now and I don't care. My number was changed a week later. 

I don't go to the Country Barn anymore and neither do my friends or anyone else that my dad or I tell the story too.

 I was coming home from being out today and had to take a train in from NYC. Before I went to go home I thought I'd walk around for a bit cause it's Friday night and I like to people watch. I got some drunk assholes in my face on the way but that's pretty harmless whatever.

 While I'm walking up the main road some guy who is smoking a cigarette against a building comes up to me. He asks me my name and if I want to hang out. Honestly, didn't seem like he was trying to rob me. I push him away and tell him 'wow, that's not okay'. He shoves me again and this time tries to snatch my glasses off my face. I push him away harder this time and tell him 'Leave me the fuck alone and go the fuck back to Parsippany or wherever the fuck you came from'. He starts swearing and saying he's gonna 'beat my fucking ass' and that I'm a 'nasty fucking bitch'.

 I haven't stopped walking this whole time mind you. He proceeds to walk with me up the street all the while trying to talk me and saying how I shouldn't have gotten up in his face/how i'm deserving of getting my teeth knocked out. I told him we were done talking and he needed to leave me alone. He didn't really seem drunk or crazy. Just super weird and angry.

 I stopped walking and he continued for a bit while I stared his ass down. I tried to continue walking on the street but he would hold back so he could walk with me. I stopped again and told him to walk on while I death glared. I turned the corner and he walked on forward. I was paranoid as heck and kept checking my back to see if he was still following me.

 I went over to the river to chill out and look at the city. Stayed there for a half hour or so and decided to take public trans home. I walked the couple blocks back to the train and saw this lunatic sitting on a bench right near the train station. I ignore him and walk on by. This crazy guy smiles and waves at me. WTF. I look back and see him wave again. I walked to the end of the block and called my brother cause I had enough. I didn't want to get on the subway while this dude was around cause I didn't want to get stuck underground or in the same train with him.

 My brother's not picking up. The dude has started to walk himself over to my end of the block. I cross the street and walk the opposite direction towards where I saw a group of cops earlier. He calls out to me

 This subway has several entrances and I tried to sneak into a side one. I was on a fairly empty platform while the one across the way was mad crowded. I'm sitting down there still being paranoid and looking around. All of a sudden I see the dude peek down the stairs across the platform and then jump off real fast. It was as if he was gonna try to come to my side without me noticing. I ran up the stairs to meet him above ground and saw him just as he was walking away from the stairs.

 I locked eyes with him and growled, while pointing at him and the exit. I told him if I saw him again I was going to get the cops upstairs(not true) and there would be trouble. So, he leaves and goes back to the street. I wait there for a while to see if he comes back down(he didn't) and then head back to the platform to wait 30minutes for my train.

 This guy really freaked me out. I didn't know what he wanted from me and I wasn't quite sure how to act. I just knew I didn't want to talk to him or be in his vicinity. ",,t5_2t3t8,1352957973.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/xafrl/people_watching_gone_wrong/

It was a fairly typical day, he does this often and we usually just take him to the door, he sniffs it a bit, then he's fine. However this time, while walking to the door, I noticed a strange vehicle parked in front of my house. It was running and a man was just sitting in it. I decided not to get too freaked out and simply went and locked the door just in case, then went back to watching TV. Being a naive and sheltered 12 year old girl, locked door and nearby phone. 

About 15 minutes later, looked around, and started to walk towards our house. At this point I was grabbing the phone and calling my mom while silently thanking myself for having the common sense to lock the door.

When the man got up the steps to our door, but its when the man started trying to open our door that he got really pissed. He jumped at the door and started snarling, barking the most vicious bark I'd ever heard from a dog in person before. The man must have realized that breaking into a house with that vicious sounding of a dog was a bad idea because my brother and I saw him booking it back to his car and speeding off right away.

I’d like to start off by giving a little background info about myself. I am a 16 year old female who lives in a somewhat suburban area in the city that I live in. I have a side job, we enjoy not having to rely on our parents for every little thing. Anyhow, the route I walk the dog goes down random streets and through a parking lot behind a middle school, which I always have an eerie feeling about when I walk down the shady drive which, occasionally, has cars parked with tinted windows. I guess this would be a good time to share that I have a secret fascination with /r/LetsNotMeet, /r/NoSleep, and CIS, or why he chose my home to break into. I still shudder when I wonder if he has been watching me for God knows how long without me having the slightest clue.

It was a night in the middle of January and, who sleeps at the foot of my bed on a regular bases. Usually when he wakes me up, he goes off on a little meowing rampage, telling me it is finally time for him to exit my room. But this night was different. He was standing in front of me on my bed, facing the door, which was slightly closed. He had a rigid posture and his fur was standing on end. But the noise. The noise he was making was what really got my attention. For those who have a feline friend, you will know the type of noise a cat makes when they are not in a very happy state. Here is what it sounds for those who don’t know: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbTeATxycc 
I instantly knew something was wrong because my cat only made that noise when another animal was in his presence, trying to calm him down. I kept glancing at the door which was where his eyes were continually fixed. And then I heard it. It was quiet, but with my cat starting to freak me out, my ears were perked for any slight noise. It was a small squeak from the stairs that were located across the hall. It was common for my stairs to squeak, since they are old, but they only did when someone was climbing them. My mind raced as I tried to think who it could be. My mother was asleep, (she went to bed before I did), since I would hear his snores from down the hall, making sure I didn’t make any of the floorboards give away my consciousness. I peeked behind my door and into the hallway, and just stood there like a dumb girl. The figure looked around my family’s second floored home

A little over two years ago, she was quite the social butterfly.  

The implications?  Many of my weekend nights were spent in a fashion circa ""Taxicab Confessions: The PG-13 Version."" I would often drive her and her two ""besties"" to and from their ""parties"" among other social endeavors.  

I for one was growing weary of the impersonal nature of these drives, there were no lights on; everything was pitch black.  I wondered why they would hang out there of all places, but offered to accompany them lest anything unfavorable happen.  

We parked my car in my driveway and walked across the street.  After reaching the curb

My sister remarked

We all laughed and then proceeded to make small talk.  After a few minutes

The van from earlier rounded a turn approximately two blocks down from us, and its movement was unshaken by the stop signs between us.  It eventually came to a stop no more than a football field's length away from us.  ""Creepy,"" I thought.

Upon stopping, I thought.  

Any and all rationalizations died when the driver started towards us with a flashlight.  At this point

""Run.""  

My sister and her two friends obliged, and he would have nothing with me.  I decided then to break his focus.

""Can I help you

His steps did not cease

""This doesn't concern you.""

This retort came as quite a shock to me

At that point, charged him into the side of his car, and told him that he had better leave lest I involve the authorities (a retired police officer lives a few doors down from me, so it wouldn't have been hard).  

He then kneed me in the nether region and used my crumpled state as an opportunity to escape.  But, ready for anything.  However, he did not make any attempt to attack me.  Instead, he pointed it in the direction of the girls' escape as he stared at me, maintaining the grin. He then backed into his van and hastily drove away, seeing as the girls had already made it to the house and were well away from the scene at this point.

Anyway, head down, assuming my boyfriend and our friend were in tow. By the time I got to the closest train station I realized that I was now alone at this point. I waited at the station for about 10 minutes hoping they'd catch up but saw no sign of them. So I hopped on the train thinking they'd be at the station we had to get off at.

I got off at my stop and had spent the whole train ride preparing a big speech for them about how they really shouldn't abandon an 18 year old girl downtown in winter... at night. I looked around but didn't see them anywhere. At this point I was tired and a bit annoyed so I decided to catch the last bus home and deal with it tomorrow.

I quickly hurried onto the bus and sat down
I did a nervous smile and told him he needed to go the opposite direction that I was going and this bus would only take him even further from his destination.
He just laughed saying things like ""oh no, or I'm going with you.""

My mind was racing. I had two options (well, come into my house where he would probably rape and murder me and my roommates OR I could get off the bus, go with him to the strip club across the street and ditch him there. My parents only lived about a 15 minute walk from this train station so I could just spend the night there.
I went with option number 2.

We went in and the creeper guy sat us in the far corner of the bar, naked babes dancing around' and he would always respond with ""Well, they aren't real, like you. I can't reach out and touch them..."" then after the third time he responded with that he put his hand out to touch my face. I backed myself away from him and I noticed he sort of jolted forward a bit as if to jump up and stop me had I attempted to make a run for it.
I told him I needed to go to the bathroom so he stood up and told me that he was going to step out for a smoke

I was in a complete panic now. I grabbed my coat and put it on as fast as I could and pulled the hood tight to cover my face. I made a mad dash for the door. As I rushed out I didn't notice that I had ran right by the man. He managed to catch me and grabbed my wrist pulling me into him so hard that my hood fell off.
He asked where I was running off to and why? He said he had a nice hotel room and had a full evening planned for us. I couldn't go just yet. Then he pulled out a 100 dollar bill and offered me that.

The town we grew up in was incredibly safe and it was very unusual for us to ever feel unsafe for the most part.  The two of us often hung out in a local park down the street from out houses. The park is quite large and open and backed onto an overgrown field and a small little wilderness type area. 

On this particular day we were hanging out on the top of a the giant metal slide which gave a great view of the whole park and the field at the back of it. We are sitting there chatting and I notice something blue at the tree line between the field and the wilderness. I notice it move closer and figure it is someone walking a dog or something in the field. 

The figure just stands there for awhile not moving just standing perfectly still. I start getting a little creeped out and point out the person to my friend. She starts yelling at the person ""hey smurff man we aren't afraid of you"" because she is an idiot. Suddenly the figure starts moving again towards us. Getting closer and moving quite fast. We freak out and hightail it home as fast as we can.  

That afternoon I am out delivering my newspapers and I walk past the park and can still see a blue figure now in the park area but still pretty far back and it just creeps me right the heck out.

He was described as having been seen wearing a blue windbreaker

I told my mom and she thought I was nuts because the guy had escaped from a few towns over and it seemed impossible for him to have travelled that far. She called the police to give the tip anyway they also seemed sceptical that he would be in out town.

This happened last summer and started pretty much a year ago. I am a guy who spends quite alot of time in front of my computer (probably too much) and my room back at my parents place has a window facing the road in front of the house. My computer is located next to the window and when I'm sitting by it I have that window to my right side. This means that if someone walks past the house

So this all started when I noticed this woman, walking by quite often. As in 5-10 times every day. No big deal of course, she probably just lives nearby I thought (which I later found she did). This woman had a very uncomfortable look to her. It didn't look like she had a shower in a while and she had this extreme smile to her face, constantly, as if someone had stapled her face into that expression.

I didn't think much about it until I noticed that she started trying making eye-contact with me. Since she walked by my window so often

Then one day, standing outside my window and looking right at me, laughing uncontrollably with her creepy smile on her face. I quickly pull the curtains and try to ignore it when I hear the door-bell.

I open the door and there she is. I'm alone home and starting to get some serious creeps. I was at the time ""baby-sitting"" my friends poodle and pick it up to use it as some kind of protection (stupid, alot, as in she just heard the best joke of her entire life. I start panicking and shut the door after quickly telling her to leave.

I tell my parents when they come home and it turns out that this woman is an old student of my mother. She says that she is mentally ill and that I shouldn't worry. ""She is nice"".

Her visits outside my window continues every day and I tell my parents again that I feel uncomfortable. They then try to talk to her

Her visits continued on a daily basis and we visit the police to see what can be done. Their answer is that we can't do shit (because of stupid laws in my country).

She often rang my door-bell but I had the sense not to answer. I noticed that as time went on

One day something happened that was enough for me. It was friday night and I was home alone. I was watching TV and heard strange noises from the street. I peeked out the window and there she was, singing and doing all kinds of strange things. I put all the lights out in my house and pretended not to be home, but I could still hear her. She was outside still. My neighbours ending up calling me several times, asking if I was okay and I said I was... but I wasn't, I was scared. My parents were hours from coming home and all I did was watching TV, pretending not to be home.

She stayed for an hour or two before leaving and the week after, they didn't have her as a patient and couldn't help us. Neither could the police. 

To make the rest of the story short (it has been way too long already), playing some sick game with a child she had started haning out with. At this point, she was scared of us because she knew we had contacted the police and different doctors and they were shouting things such as ""you see that house, watch out for them or they will call the polics, RUN!"" and she, and the child, would run and come back minutes later, hunting her when she is clearly out of control.

So I might have attributed the morning calls to drunk dialing, he should have sobered up by the time he called my mum.

1332894477.0,rgq2p,[MY] Creepy encounter walking home,IveGotCarpet,107,14,10,"I've spent most of this week reading loads of creepy stories on this sub-reddit which got me thinking about some weird things that have happened to me. The creepiest moment of my life so far will probably seem pretty tame when compared to some of the stuff you read on here but it was still scary none-the-less.
Right

September last year we were watching UFC (I forget which number) but I remember it was Jon Jones vs Rampage because I lost a substantial amount of money on a bet when Rampage got completely dominated. The event went on until around 3am, this led to some back alleys which led to a 5mile home-straight consisting of a highroad to my right and forest/park to my left. In the day time the park was really inviting as it was just like swings, slides and climbing frames completely surrounded by a wall of trees... it was like something straight out of centre parks (not sure if you have those in america), however at night time the lack of lighting made it a stereotypical, almost scoobydoo-like, creepy place.

Anyway I had made it to the home straight without interuption and everything was going as normal, but it was unusual for their lights to be that bright. I thought nothing of it at first but the lights stayed on me for way longer than they should have. All I was thinking was how has this car not overtaken me yet? I took out one of my headphones and I heard the engine running really slowly like when you pull a car out of a drive. It was at this point I realised the car was literally right behind me. The driver must have seen me notice him because he sped up so he was now going at the exact same as me. Being naive I thought he was probably just wanting directions or something so I stopped to see just what he wanted. As I stopped so did he. I took out my other headphone and said something along the lines of ""hey whats up?"". He didnt say anything he just stared at me. He looked like he was in his mid 40s and not of english decent. My best guess is he was Polish due to his greyish white hair, big build and scruffy appearance. (No offence to any polish people by the way, thats just how the polish people where I live generally look). His blank stare kind of freaked me out so I just stuck my headphones back in and started walking fast down the road.

This was far from the end however, which accompanied with his now grinnning face really freaked me the fuck out. I was genuinely panicing at this point and started weighing up my limited options. I could try and run home, but this would mean running in a straight line for 4 miles, which I probably couldnt do for a start and he would have been able to drive alongside me the whole way. So that option was a no. I could attempt the freak out method and try and act crazy to scare him off, but I had already shown him signs of fear so doing this would probably result in a physical confrontation. I can take care of myself just fine in a fair fight but this guy could have a knife, and axe or a gun so that option was a definite no. In the end I had to go for my third and final option of dart into the forest and hide until he drives off. As much as I didnt want to do it I jumped over the small ditch between the path and the forest and proceeded to hide in a big jumble of bushes like 20 meters in.

At this point my heart was in my throat and I just sat there staring at the road waiting for the lights from the cars headlights to disappear. I must have sat there for what felt like an eternity but was in fact only a couple of minutes... but the light didnt go away. All I could think was please, but I felt sick. He just sat there rocking backwards and forwards. I took a deep breath and then sprinted as fast as I could back the way I had came, back through the forest and came out on the edge of the road where the home straight had started. I say sprinted, but it felt like one of those dreams where your legs dont work properly they just shake and wobble uncontrollably. From there I ran all the way back to my friends house. I dont remember much about that journy at all. It felt like one second I was in the forest and the next I was banging on his door still shaking uncontrollably.

He let me in and his parents called the police who came around an hour or so later. I had to go to the station to make a report and give a description of the guy,False,,t5_2t3t8,False,,,t3_rgq2p

Not 5 minutes later, and he reminded me I forgot to ask for his apt. number. Nothing weird, yet. Again, I thanked him and changed the information. Before I could hang up, this was our conversation:

*Me: Yes sir
*Him:(Creepy laugh) Are you doing alright?*
*Me: Yes sir
*Him: Good. I'm going to hang up now. See you soon.*

This particular friend of mine is athletic and very good at the cold shoulder, rather sleepily, that he had the wrong number and no such girl lived there. He asks what her name is, she gives it. He asks her the standard ""So, what are you wearing?"" She informs him, ""Flannel PJs"" and bids him good night. She thinks this is the end of it.

The next night

However he doesn't stop. He keeps calling night after night. This is particularly worrisome because the dorm phone numbers are formatted such that you can get a good idea where a room is by number and vice versa.

I had just finished my first year of university and my roommate and I
after several failed attempts
desirable neighbourhood of Toronto. The unit itself was nice
surrounding buildings were mostly government housing
apartment was on the second floor with an open balcony looking onto
some sketchy back parking lot. School was starting in two days and we
didn't have much more time to look around
year lease.


I had only lived in the city for a year before than in residence
(before that I lived in the suburbs) so needless to say I was less
than street-smart. I was very friendly to all the neighbours on our
floor
remember this one guy always had his door slightly ajar as his cat
liked to roam around the hallways and I guess he was too lazy to get
up and let her in all the time. I'd always notice him because his
apartment was across from the garbage chute and I'd see him on the
couch and he'd smile and nod. My boyfriend at the time lived in the
northern part of the city but worked downtown so he was over almost
every day and night. I was reluctant to give him a key to the unit (my
roommate and I had agreed not to make copies for our boyfriends) so I
often gave it to him on my way to work or put it in our hiding spot.
The hiding spot was next to the garbage chute
built-in glass cases that hold the fire extinguisher. I would slightly
lift the extinguisher and slide the key underneath. My boyfriend had
the code to our building (1-2-3-4
arrangement worked perfectly for months. He was the only person who
knew where it was


One day I went shopping before my boyfriend got off work and didn't
feel like dropping by to give him the key
was in our usual spot. I came back from shopping and went to open the
door to the apartment but it was still locked. I figured my boyfriend
was in the shower
texted back saying he was still at work
to grab the key. It wasn't there.


Like I said
thing I could think of was that someone had seen me hide it and taken
it. I was careful when leaving the key
was around so the only possibility was that someone had been watching
me through the peep hole
My roommate and her boyfriend had gone to visit her family in her
hometown about 5 hours away and she had obviously taken her key with
her. She wouldn't be back until Monday
my landlord. I was afraid he would be mad that I had been hiding the
key (as I admit it wasn't the smartest idea) so I said I had lost my
entire keychain. He didn't have a spare
side of the building onto our balcony and basically break into our
apartment. I had left the window slightly ajar but the balcony door
locked
in to unlock the door from the inside. Since neither of us had keys
he had to replace the lock and gave me both copies
roommate when we came back on Monday.


That night I was feeling less than stellar
while my boyfriend went out with some friends. At about 1 am while I
was laying in bed texting him and drifting off to sleep
in the door. In my half-awake state I attributed the sound to my
roommate coming home and started to drift off again when I snapped
fully awake realizing she wasn't due back for two days
the new keys to my apartment were on the kitchen counter. I freaked
out because I was just texting my boyfriend so I knew it couldn't have
been him either. I heard a few more key attempts and jiggling of the
doorhandle

gotten up to look through the peephole but I was completely frozen
with fear. It stopped after a few minutes
again to make 100% sure it wasn't him. Not only had someone watched me
hide the key and then stolen it
I was home and sleeping. To this day I have no idea who it was
have a feeling it was the creepy cat guy from across the hall as his
unit was directly across from where I hid the key. I'm grateful that
nothing came of this

Let me start by stating that I am a girl. I was 12 (about 5' 2'' and 100 lbs) at the time and I am now 17. A little background information: This happened at around 10:00 at night on our outdoor downtown mall. It's normally a place where families go out to eat dinner/play with their kids and that kind of stuff. It's not sketchy until after dark. Normally my parent's wouldn't let me be downtown after 9:30 but I was with three other friends (one girl, Drew and Colm) and we were getting picked up soon. We thought it would be cool to sit near the end of the mall and sit and talk. It was really shadowy and is kind of like an ally. That's when he walked up.

He looked homeless. He was african american with a lot of clothes on (it was summertime) and his breath reeked of alcohol. I was immediately creeped out. Why would this man in his 50's stop and talk to four 12 year old kids? 

He started making conversation, ""It's hot out, huh? yeah it's supposed to cool down later this week,"" until I noticed that he was getting closer and closer to me. He suddenly reached out and grabbed my knee, whispering, ""Have you ever been to jail?"" 

I immediately shrunk back and looked at my other friends. They were all looking back and forth from each other like the didn't know what to do. I told him no, I have. Here's some practice. I'm touching you right now. How would you respond if you were in jail?""
At that I gathered up all of the courage that I had and tried to knee him in the groin. I missed. He laughed. He told me that I was going to have to learn to fight better than that to keep people like him away from me. His eyes then sort of narrowed in and he started to get even closer. I was cornered. He kind of grasped at my pants button and that's when my friend Morgan found the courage to grab my hand and yank me away. We kept running and then she left me crying on the middle of the mall

The boys kept saying that if he had touched me ""ONE MORE TIME"" they would have stepped in. Fucking pricks. 

I never saw him again. I never told any adults about that. We just kind of brushed it off as something that's bound to happen. But

My family had just moved from a two family apartment building in an area that had gone a bit shitty to a nice

This store was one we normally avoided because it was small and kind of dirty

The guy behind the counter looked like a deranged version of Brian Posehn and he was looking at both of us in a way that made my skin crawl. He asked for her ID, he smiled at her and laughed.

""Now I know where you live

My sister paid for our things and we left as fast as we could. We drove back to the new house and told our parents. The only thing that calmed us down was our mom pointing out that my sister needed a new ID. We had just moved

A week went by and nothing happened. Denise and my parents forgot about it and we never went back to the store.

About a month or two after the incident at the store my sister was visiting a friend and my parents had decided to go on a mini vacation

It was around 2am and I was laying in bed reading Youth In Revolt for the umpteenth time using this new little book light I had gotten from my mom when I heard the front door open (we have a Craftsman style house with a closed in porch so there is a screen door

My bedroom is upstairs, like they were trying to pull it out of the door. Thankfully, the door was locked.

I looked down the stairs and the only light that was on in the entire house was the exterior porch light. It was the guy from the convenience store. I started crying and shaking. I needed my phone but I couldn't find it in the darkness and I didn't want to make any sound or turn a light on to signal that anyone was home. I stood frozen in the darkness as this guy tried to look into my house. I watched him give up and leave my porch

I called my parents and sister. One of them called my four male cousins who rushed over to the house and sat with me until my parents and sister got home.

I was freaking out. How did he get our new address? Turns out he had gone to our old apartment looking for me and my sister

We didn't call the police. A few weeks after that he was arrested for asking underage teenage girls to show him their boobs for cigarettes. I think he's in jail but I'm not sure.

1337824709.0,u21ww,The Real Reason I Left NYC... (x-post from r/nosleep),GodHatesSkags,164,69,54,"I first posted this in r/nosleep and

I recently moved back to Ohio after living about 6 months in NYC. I've given everyone the same reasons for my return: the city is loud, crowded, dangerous, all the old standbys. I've been too terrified to tell anyone the real reason I left the city, but it's reached the point that if I hold it in any longer, I'll burst. I need to tell someone and since r/nosleep always seems to keep a certain level of skepticism, I can't think of a better place. This might seem long-winded

I realize how ridiculous some of this may seem as you're reading

I moved to NYC to pursue an acting career. It's been a lifelong dream to act for a living, also fellow actors, and started auditioning ([this is me and three of them around Christmas time](http://i.imgur.com/Cqvb1.jpg); the fourth was taking the picture). It started off alright, a couple little shows in some tiny theatres, but soon my savings started to dry up and I desperately needed a job. I was fortunate enough to become an elf at Macy's Santaland (Here's [me in my elf costume](http://i.imgur.com/sibh0.jpg) and [this is a pic of the 2011 Parade](http://i.imgur.com/W8SBU.jpg) with the elves pointed out as comparison). The pay was decent and I met some incredible people; one of these people was named Erica. She was great; we hit it off immediately and actually got pretty close. Not romantically (I'm engaged and she, I soon discovered, was in a relationship), so in the mornings there wasn't much in the way of privacy. It didn't bother either of us (she was also an actor and we don't have much shame in that area) and frankly I was just thankful to be next to someone attractive.

One morning as we were changing, then realized what I was seeing and tried to hide it. I asked about it and she shrugged it off saying that a cyclist had clipped her as she was crossing the street. It's a plausible story in the city, but I was wary. The location of the bruise and the standard dimensions of a bike didn't quite add up. As I was thinking about it, for some reason I realized she hadn't mentioned her boyfriend in quite some time. Almost immediately, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I wanted to ask her about it, but we had to split up for the morning meeting at that point and I didn't get a chance.

Over the next few days, and the bruise wasn't getting any better. I was worried, but like an idiot I didn't confront her about it. Then one day she came in and I could tell something was very wrong. She was nervous and jumpy; EXTREMELY out of character for her. When I asked her what was wrong, she just mumbled something about a visit and left it at that. I decided to keep an eye on her for the day. We'd developed a brother-sister kind of relationship and I wanted to make sure she was okay. So when she was assigned the gatekeeper position (the elf who organizes groups to see Santa), I asked if I could be an usher (an elf who takes said groups to Santa). It was as close as I could get and I could watch easily from there, plus we could interact and I could (hopefully) cheer her up a little.

The day started great. Things were running smoothly and I even managed to get a smile from Erica. But as I was returning from escorting a group that afternoon, muscular, and just mean looking. It was his eyes...I'll never forget those eyes as long as I live. Erica and this guy were talking and he looked pissed. He started to raise his voice and she clearly needed help, so I ran up and said something along the lines of ""Is everything okay up here?"" as nicely as I could. I put my hand on Erica's shoulder as a gesture of support at that point. I guess it made something in this psycho snap because the next thing I knew he had shoved Erica into the trees we had setup nearby, grabbed me by the throat, and bull-rushed me into the nearest wall. I'm not a small guy, but this guy...he was unbelievably strong. Thank God the managers (both big guys themselves) were close at the time; I have no doubt this guy would have killed me right then and there if they and a couple coworkers hadn't pried him off.

I collapsed, you son of a bitch! I'll fucking KILL YOU!"" As soon as my head started to clear, I connected the dots: HE was Erica's boyfriend. The visit she mumbled about earlier had been him coming in. I couldn't believe it. I went and helped Erica up and we left the floor together, both moving slowly. When the managers got back, they told us the police had been called and asked if we wanted to press charges. I wanted to say yes, I SHOULD have said yes. But when I looked at her, there was this wild, saying no

When we got to our lockers

She did over the next couple days and as the Christmas season progressed she even seemed to be in better spirits. Then, irritably, she had called the previous night and quit. He was upset she'd left us high-and-dry right before our busiest days; I was upset she hadn't told me she was quitting. I texted her to ask about it and her response concerned me. It was short, very clipped; strange for someone who was a stickler for proper grammar.

I started to get very worried. As we continued to text over the next few days, very cryptic and short. She aslso started to defriend a lot of people, mostly guys. I knew something was wrong but it didn't seem like there was anything I could do about it. I talked to a friend (who was a NYPD officer) and she told me that most likely nothing would be done even if I brought my suspicions to the police. They were just too swamped during the season and there wasn't enough solid evidence.

My concern for Erica became a primary focus for me, right?

I don't remember the exact date, a blood-curdling scream, the clatter of metal, thundering footsteps, our apartment door, then the sound of blood pounding in my ears. I slept in a loft, so by the time I got down the hallway, who was crying hysterically. Her door had been kicked open; I could see the footprint and there were splinters everywhere. Everyone else was so concerned for my roommate that they had all missed our kitchen knife laying just beyond her door. We finally got her calmed down enough to tell us what had happened. I only heard her first words: ""He was huge...and those eyes..."" I turned and ran to the window. The police were arriving; I guess someone in the building had called them after all the noise. I noticed one of the officers talking to someone on the street. He was huge

All I could do was thank God he didn't know my room was the last one in the hallway and that for some reason

I was on the phone with my parents 30 seconds later, but I wanted to make sure that this psycopath knew so that he'd leave my roommates alone. The next day I was throwing everything I owned into a Uhaul. I spent the last of my money renting that truck and giving my roommate cash to fix her door. But I didn't care. I had to get out.

I haven't heard from Erica in weeks

""Hi

We didn't know each other very well

Another pause. ""You..."" And then he broke down sobbing. It was the pitiable

""Mr. Smith? Are you okay?""

More sobbing. Then he hung up.

I was spooked. I knew Kitty was home and that her mom was not (unlike Ron, I went to my own mom and told her everything. She called Kitty's house, but as soon as it was answered I heard someone shout at her through the phone. Then she hung up the phone.

We went down to Kitty's house together. We pounded on the door, but this was in the early 2000's, so cell phones were still pretty shitty and she had to walk out into the street to get reception, about 20 yards away. I stepped onto the sidewalk and looked up at Kitty's bedroom window.

And then I saw her, she started pointing around the side of the house. I knew there was a back door, and with my stupid twelve-year-old brain on autopilot, I ran around the side of the house. My mom didn't notice for a while, and I went around to the back, went up the porch steps, and tried the back door that led into the kitchen.

I didn't hear anything. ""Kitty?"" No answer. I went further, and to the base of the steps. ""Kitty?"" I said again, and this time I heard responsive pounding on a door upstairs. I hurried up the steps and to her room. By now I could hear my mom (probably having realized I was gone) pounding on the door even harder and screaming my name. I remember hesitating a moment. I didn't want to scare my mom but I also didn't want to leave Kitty. I told myself I'd get Kitty and her brother and leave straight away.

I made it to the top hall and saw that both bedroom doors were blocked off with chairs beneath the handles. I pulled them both away and pulled Kitty's door open first.

""He's acting crazy

So we grabbed her little brother

We turned around and see Ron at the top of the steps

I freaked the fuck out

Apparently the police found him passed out from blood loss and before long he was being rushed to the hospital. Kitty's mom came back from her business trip early

I moved to Japan a few years ago for school

So one day I noticed that I had missed SEVEN calls. Did I mention that I had just gotten there and had no friends??? I tried calling the number back, because I thought she was legit- like someone from the school?? I was stupid...

But I had been teaching little kids and there was something weird about the way she talked. 

I know it sounds weird

She said she was friends with 'Sally' . 'Who the f is Sally?? ' I thought. 

She asked me where I live in [neighborhood I lived in]. If I was married. What time I go home very night. 

Keep in mind this was all in Japanese and at the time I could not speak well

I hung up. They called back. They would call me 15-20+ times a day. I dreaded looking at my phone. Sometimes it was the 'little girl' and sometimes just breathing. 

I didn't have curtains on my windows

It really sucked. 

On my way home every day I would duck into shops

I trusted NO ONE. CUT EYE FOR ALL! WTF ARE YOU LOOKING AT kind of thing :/

And still the phone would ring and ring. They were calling from two phone numbers. 

So I went to the police, thanks! They just took me to the cell phone shop and showed me how to record conversations ( like I was going to fucking pick up the phone???) and how to block the numbers. 

I blocked them and the calls stopped

So one day while washing cabbages in my kitchen I was looking out the window

I called one of the numbers and an Indian man picked up. 

me: ' why the fuck have you been calling me ?'
him :' I haven't been calling youuuu '
me :' did you give my number to somebody? '
him: ' no
me: 'then you have been calling me'
him: ' no
ME: 'I AM NOT STUPID I KNOW IT WAS YOU. SHUT UP AND LISTEN I AM ONLY GOING TO SAY THIS ONCE * insert the most horrible things I have ever and will ever say to a person ever * YOU WILL NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT ME AGAIN OR I WILL FIND YOU AND CUT YOUR '()'&amp;% OFF. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

I was probably 8 or 9 when this story happened. It was a lazy summer Sunday afternoon. Traffic in our suburb was slow

""Hey, and set up on my driveway right by a semi-major suburban street.

I'm going to go on a tangent here - I've always been an ""intelligent"" kid

Anyway, $2, $5, even $10 for our $.25 cups of lemonade.

This is where the story gets interesting. My friends had just gone into my house to make more lemonade, and he wouldn't have been in the way of traffic. (And remember, for me to think something was odd or off, it really had to be unusual.)

This guys walks up to us and buys a lemonade. Gives us $5. And begins to chat with us. It wasn't the typical ""thanks for the lemonade, slicked-back hair said ""hey, do you like my shoes?"" ""My friends make fun of me, they say I'm too old to have these shoes. Do you like em?""

I was a pretty shy kid, but he was just kind of staring at him. He usually had a great sense of when something was wrong or off, which was good, because I possessed no such ability.

As soon as he starts talking about his car

My friends were already coming back out at this point. They joined me and I went unknowingly back to my conversation with the creep. He wanted to show me some stuff on his car. It was really cool stuff, not overly frightened, but there was this urgency in it. She wanted me to come talk to her. I turned around and began to walk towards her.

The guy hears her, peels out, and speeds away. I don't know if he was going to take me, or was just a weirdo that wanted me to check out his car. One thing is for certain, though. He knew what he was doing was wrong, because when he saw my mom coming towards us, he got the hell out of there. I'm so glad that my big brother was there to look out for me.

One of our favorite modes of entertainment was walking around in the middle of the night. My friend's mom worked night shift at the hospital, through a golf course, and back. 

One of these nights, and the street was dark and quiet.

A truck drives down the road towards us and passes us. At first I don't think much of it, when I suddenly notice that the truck has stopped. 

I look behind and motion for my friends that the truck has stopped. We immediately begin running. As we're running

We hide behind some bushes while my friend dials 911. We watch the truck speed past the house whose bushes we're hiding in, seeing how scared we are. After a few minutes, he walks us home, where a cop is waiting along with my friend's dad.

That night we got heavily reprimanded by both the cop and my friend's father. We trudged back into my friend's room where we all mutually decided it was about time to go to sleep.

One summer day when I was 8 or so I was plumb bored outta my mind so I hatched a plan to create a scrapbook of neighborhood flowers. I snatched up my Mickey Mouse camera (the kind with those flash capsule things) and set out on my bike to find some tulips and shit.

Everything was going swimmingly - boredom satiated and plenty of lovely subjects. One in particular was a home that had a statuette of the Virgin Mary surrounded by rose bushes. I snapped a pic and was on my way. About 5 minutes later a black car pulled up next to me and a frumpy woman leaned out of the passenger side window.

Here are just a few more things that happened that I can remember. 

She went to the doctor another time while I was in Rogers

This one you will probably laugh at me for. The friend ""Allysa"" had been texting me late at night telling me that she though Meggan was ""special"". She said she thought Meggan was some kind of angel or some crap. I dunno but I honestly fell for it a little. I didn't think she was actually an angel but I thought maybe there was something special about her. She's specially fucking crazy. 

The other people that she had made up on the internet. The girl that hardly contacted me at all...her picture was just like all the other ones. It was really ""emo"" like or whatever. Dark

I found out about another ex of hers and I went to meet him after all this crazy stuff went down. He was a twin and I talked to him, Dakota. I found out she had done some crazy stuff to him too and still had been trying when she and I were together but I never knew. I ended up getting to know them both very well and dated Dakota. He was pretty awesome too. :) 

I finally remember the name of the person she was supposed to go camping with. His name is Mac. He actually helped me find Jace and Dakota. 

Okay! So after all this is said and done..she writes me on facebook. She has a new last name. Meggan Hattingly (I think I spelled it right). Told me that the day she left on the plane she met a guy that she fell in love with immediately. They apparently got married shortly after and had a daughter. He is in the army I guess. Then she apologized and that's when I got my beloved necklace back. I told her I forgave her and it was in the past. I had just gotten back from Afghanistan and I wasn't really in the mood for it. 

I had the same phone number for over 5 1/2 years. She started texting me and asking me things about court martials and jag. They are military terms. I don't know too much about them but I tried to help her the best I could. I am a cop but what happens to people after they are arrested is for higher ranking to deal with. Not much crime happens at my base. 

She tells me her husband has been beating her and she's scared for her life and her daughters...she won't leave me alone. These texts go on and on for about 3 months and I keep trying to help. I finally tell my boyfriend what happened with this girl and while we are out one night he grabs my phone and texts her telling her that she needs to leave me alone and that I want nothing to do with her. I haven't spoken to her since. That's about it. 

I know it's not ultra creepy but...I thought you might find it interesting. 

Holy shit! Here is my old myspace. I can't remember the log in info but here is a link to a video of she and I singing. She isn't very pretty...don't judge me. She is the girl in the passenger seat.

Anyway, PAX East (a gaming convention held annually in Boston) was coming up and I waited til the last minute to get tickets. Everything was sold out, couldn't find a ticket to save my life. So, I posted on Facebook, ""Hey, anyone have an extra PAX ticket?"" Sure enough, Chris commented on it saying he had one. I was super excited, ""No

Now, phone number, and Facebook, just in case something went wrong. And I made sure the place he took me to for dinner was very close by.

So, he got out of the car and hugged me and opened the door for me... which is fine, I can dig that I guess... It wasn't until we were waiting in line to get food (we went to a burrito place) when he puts his arm around me. And I was just like, umm... and didn't know how to react (I am a total socially awkward penguin more often than not). Suddenly, Chris puts his arm down, turns to the guy behind us, and yells ""What do you think you are doing? Are you looking at this girl's ass? This is my girlfriend

I was fucking horrorstruck. But I still hadn't received the stupid ticket. I could tell this guy wasn't a crazy serial killer, on the ride home, we almost got into a car accident (for some reason I almost feel like it was on purpose, I could be totally wrong, but someting seemed off) and I was so ready to be rid of this guy. (Yes, I am going to hell, deal with it). By this point I had the ticket in my purse. Suddenly his hand is on my leg at a red light. What. The. Fuck. I looked at him and was like, we are not romantically involved.

When we got to my dorm, sorry, I have homework, goodbye. Opened the car door. ""But wait. Please. Let me come in."" Again I said, no, sorry, I really need to get some stuff done.

I was interested in a girl named Pryn who I had met the week before and we had seemed to hit it off pretty well. After the entire day was spent on Robert's Rules of Order and leadership training

By the end of the night, or the other part of the resort to play billiards. Pryn and I were still by the hot tub and things had a gotten hot and heavy, and I don't mean the water. She had started off by massaging my back and then we ended up making out furiously. Our hands were all over each other and we hungrily attacked each others mouths like it was our last minute on Earth.

After several minutes of making out

As I am kissing her again, commented on everything from statuses to pictures from years back, and was rude to any male that commented on her page. She unfriended him but mostly everyone knew that he was a nut job. 

This had reached the ears of our student government and the general consensus was that Blunder was a strange dude. He was only in student government because we needed a non-traditional student to represent those who were not between 18-22 years old. I think Blunder was 28 and Pryn was 18. I turn around and I see Blunder is sitting on a pool chair with a small towel over his head staring straight ahead at us. She told me everything I relayed to you here and she asks me if we should continue down by the beach. I said no, he had to learn his place.

Blunder didn't take this well. From across the pool we could hear growling, uncontrolled breathing like a panic attack or asthma. Blunder's was rocking back and forth on the pool chair and the towel had fallen off his head to reveal the crazed look in his eyes. That's when I stopped being brave and realized this guy might be a problem. As we swam towards the other end of the pool, Blunder screamed and jumped into the pool. He was thrashing against the water like a mad man but he was swimming like Michael Phelps. Pryn and I swam to the ledge and pulled ourselves out of the water. We high tailed it out of there and went to my room. We called our adviser over the room phone and told her what happened. Unfortunately, she couldn't do anything about it since he didn't hurt us and she didn't want to deal with anything happening away from the school since she didn't want to cause an incident.

I saw her reasoning and we decided to wait until we returned to school the next day to do something about it. The following day

We went to Public Safety and they said they would take care of it. We find out that Blunder had gotten a warning that if either Pyrn or I complained about him again, had complained about him being inappropriate in the past before. We never heard from him outside of student government meetings in which he would constantly scream, rant, and make irrational arguments against whatever was being discussed. Whenever, Pyrn or I would present a bill, he would instantly be against it and scream us down. Eventually Blunder was kicked off campus for harassing another girl who reported him to the campus police. 

Edit: Removed reference to sexual areas. I don't recall his name for the life of me at the moment so I will continue to call him Blunder.

 This isn't a spooky sort of story, when I was a preschooler in Alabama. 
  My parents were both DJ's at a local Christian radio station in Birmingham at that time and my sister was a kindergardener, so they hired someone they thought they could trust, the teenaged daughter of a coworker. I believe her name was Shaniqua, and I don't remember much about her except she scared me. And rightly so.

  I'm grateful our brains have good coping mechanisms that we can't even control, surprising for my age at the time.
   I remember it was nighttime, so it was my turn. My dad had run the water, tested it to be sure it was the right temperature, and I was standing in the bathroom wrapped in what seemed to be a huge bath towel while I waited for him to give me the ""ok"" to get in the tub. (In reality, it was probably just a regular sized towel, but to my four year old self it seemed the size of a bed sheet.)
  My loving dad finished running the water, because what kid doesn't think booty-shaking isn't hilarious? I clearly remember the mood suddenly get very still and heavy, then I heard my dad tell me to get out of the tub. He was so serious, I was certain I had done something wrong, maybe my booty-shaking had made him mad? I was just trying to be silly! I didn't mean to get into trouble! But I obeyed and as I got out of the tub, he gently wrapped me in my towel, reassured me I had done nothing wrong, I had no clue what was going on
  
  I went downstairs to my momma to wait for her to get off the phone and to hear what my dad had to tell her, and waited for my dad to explain what this turn of events meant. 

  He gently told me to turn around while he unwrapped me from my towel, and then silence. She didn't say anything for what seemed like a long long time. Then she asked my dad what happened. He had no idea. They asked me what had happened, who had done this to me? I had no idea what they were talking about, I was just as confused as they were. Then they told me. My whole backside, especially my bottom, was completely black and blue. Someone had beaten a four year old little girl black and blue. 

  After some discussion as to how this could have happened

 I can recall very few times seeing my father that angry. Angry enough that he had no words. Just raw fury. My mother, but I do know that Shaniqua never watched me again. And I cannot recall if I ever saw that family again. I know my parents didn't press charges, but I also know they became VERY VERY vigilant when it came to someone watching their children! 

  Only just a year or so ago, ""I can."" I asked her if she was ever punished by Shaniqua like how I was, and my sister told me this exaclty, ""No, she never beat me. But I remember when she would beat you. I remember her taking you in the back room. And I remember hearing the wooded spoon hitting your butt. And your crying. And I'm sorry I never stood up for you.

This story took place about 5 years ago when I was 16 and lived in my old house at the bottom of a cul-de-sac. Around twilight I was in my bedroom which looked out onto the back garden

I had finished drying my body and was going to use my towel as a turban for my hair. You know when you bend forward, well I was just whipping my head up when he caught my eye. There was a guy crouching in the bushes outside staring straight at me. It felt like I stopped for a number of seconds staring back but in reality I think I was actually quite smooth about it, even though it felt like I’d had all the wind knocked out of me. In one continuous movement I flung my head up, turned around and headed straight out my door into the hall way. Naked. With my whole family at home.

I ripped the turban off my head and wrapped it round myself as I walked towards the living room that looked out to the front garden. My parents and (older) brother were there watching TV and just as I started to say, bolted outside and caught up with him at the top of the cul-de-sac. My mum and I went to the window trying to read the body language and see what was going on and I told her he was watching me get changed. I could now get a proper look at the guy- he was pretty young, early twenties or maybe even late teens and looked positively petrified.

After a few minutes the three of them walked back down towards my house and I quickly ran back to my room to shove on some clothes. I came back into the hallway as my brother came in the front door telling my mum

“Bollocks!” I said. “He was watching me get changed. He was hiding in the bushes!!!”

My mum looked worried and my brother looked kind of shocked/ amused and told us that dad was giving the guy a lift home. I couldn’t believe my dad bought his story especially since if you were running away from the park

He never did come back... But I do now shut my curtains when I’m changing. Always.

I was riding the bus home a little later than usual because of a school project I was working on at my friend's house. I was about half way home when a man who had to be at least 80 years old got on the bus. He immediately stood out because he was wearing clothes that I would have expected a 13 year old skate boarding kid to wear. Also, which if you don't know what those are they are just incredibly baggy pants for teenagers. I was listening to my ipod and I really didn't think anything of this guy, except he had a slightly strange appearance.

He immediately took a seat directly opposite me on the bus so we are sitting face to face. He said something to me, hoping the conversation was over, but he continued. He asked me what kind of things I like to do and where I like to hang out. I just gave him some vague, stereotypical teenager answers like going to the movies and whatnot. He then asked me what I was doing tonight and that's when I got the sense that things were getting really weird. I responded saying i was headed home because I had school in the morning. He accepted that but continued to ask me if I would want to hang out with him sometime at his house. He asked me at least three times in a row, each time I kept saying "" I don't know, man. I don't think so"". I stared to get really freaked out so I pulled the buzzer to get off the bus probably 6 or so blocks early. As I got up to get off, he grabbed my arm and pulled my face close to his and he looked me in the eyes and said, really well."" I was just absolutely shocked. My thoughts were just a complete mess and I was just so fucking taken aback. I pulled my arm away and stepped off the bus and that was the end of it.

I left the door (open...fuck me right?) and i went to tell my dad about the man. we came downstairs and the man was gone and door closed. I flipped out and my dad just said the man probably left. So i went upstairs to go to sleep about a half hour after the man came. I just accepted what my father said to put my mind to ease. I coulda sworn i heard a tapping coming from my attic all night.

Please excuse any writing errors! 


So, living in a new state,I am around 5""2, and female. Where  I worked I was generally off in the corner of the building working by myself. My shift was from 10pm to around 7am. 


It was around my first break, I noticed a guy, he was older then me,probably late 20's-early 30's had been walking around my area for a while looking around, I decided he probably needed help, I asked if I could help him find anything and he asked where the adult diapers were so I showed him and that was that.


The next day he was there at the same time, I kept working so I didn't fall behind in my work, the conversation was generally normal he was here from out  of town working he never specified for what. Then he started talking to me about of all things periods! 


 Obviously,when I came back he was gone. 


Next day same deal,I am just standing there like, alright I don't know why that would be something I need to know about you since, I don't know you...I don't even know this guys name! Then, he asked me what stuff I use because, he ""has a heavy flow.""


About this time I excused myself to the back room to find one of my bosses


This went on for almost a week. I was always on the lookout for this guy so I could go to the back and not deal with him


He finally left me alone while I was working when one of the bosses finally got there to talk to him


I even quit going outside to smoke because I was a little scared he'd be out there waiting. Which even after he left me alone


So,I did however find out he was related to a co-worker,was not born with both parts,and just generally insane.

I live in Southern California, and was constantly working on it in the middle of the parking lot.  Some times I'd see him while coming or going or taking out the trash.  I'd smile, nod, he'd do the same.  This was the routine.  It was safe and comfortable.

One day while taking out the trash (without greeting me) he asked

People start hanging out at his apartment constantly.  They don't took clean, I try to time my trips out around him.  Eventually the property manager drops by and asks me about him, tells me that some people have had some problems and asks me if I've noticed anything weird.  Wanting to stay out of it, I just tell her that I never see him.

One night, and I park.  The parking lot is well-lit, and this guy materializes out of nowhere.  ""Hey, smoke reefer?""  My wife's idiot friend responds, ""yeahhh.""  He says, ""hold out your hand,"" and she does.  He drops what has to be a gram of mary jane into her palm.  He says,"" and then he disappears.

Fast forward.  Mister White is having a party with what I assume is his family.  It's loud but a weekend and the middle of the day so IDGAF.  Police show up, and the police are taking him away.  He's screaming ""You guys are fucking nazis man!  I'm just trying to support my family!  A fella has a right to support his family!""  I sigh with relief because I assume this dude is going away for a while.  I ask my property manager what happened.

The guy had threatened to kill our neighbor with a knife.  I have no idea why

A few days later,"" he says, ""how are you doing?""  I tell him I'm fine, ""How are you, Walter?"" I ask.  He says, ""I'm good.  The neighbor called the cops on me.  A guy's just trying to support his family.""  Then he starts talking about how he was in lock up because he has schizophrenia and the cops confiscated his plants.  ""Yeah,"" I respond.  ""Do you have a cigarette lighter?""  I do because at the time I have a pack a day habit (but by this time I've moved my smoking time indoors for obvious reasons).  I nod, ""thanks man.""

Then he looks me dead in the eyes.  I can remember this moment.  This is what it must have been like to be a member of the Manson family.  He had some of the (cliche ahoy) bluest eyes I had ever seen, ""I'm okay,"" and he says, ""Don't worry about your mother, man.  Mine was hard on me too, you know?  You gotta go with what you feel in your heart.  You're okay.""  I don't know what prompted this; I'm most disturbed by the fact that at the time I was at odds with my mom about some inconsequential shit and I was feeling down about it.  The minute I close the door, I think to myself that the guy has to either be some type of psychic, or Satan come to drag me down to Hell.

Progressively, that's why he has so many bikes.  He's a bike thief and this is a chop shop.  This is what my home has become.""

This is the last straw and he's evicted.  He's not ""evicted"" evicted because of his rights as a renter and keeps paying his rent, ""My old lady left me man, my old lady left me.  She took my silver man.  She took my mama's silver!""  He keeps going on.  I don't remember how I tactfully evaded this, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't and that I just said ""uh"" and went upstairs.  At this point I feel kind of sorry for the guy because he's clearly a mess.

Later, ""Do you know a guy that lives in that apartment named Walter White?"" and I say, ""I know him, why?"" and the kid starts talking about how it's his dad.  He came by to ""kick his ass"" because of something to do with the kid's little brother.  The kid starts talking about how he's a son of a bitch.  While he's talking about what a son of a bitch his dad is, he pulls a lighter and cigarette out of his pocket and starts smoking.  The kid tells me that the dude has been in and out of psych hospitals ever since he (the kid) was born.  I tell him that if I see Walter again, I'll tell him that he's looking for him.

Fast forward, or just a random act of violence.  I have a smoke on my patio, and I hear Walter's ""old lady"" come home. Then I hear her scream and she doesn't stop.  Of course, I call the police.

They show up, ""don't take him away!"" and he's screaming about how they're nazis.  By this point, I've made the decision to move and only have about two weeks left in that apartment.  I'm between semesters so I make the decision not to go outside unless I know for sure that guy isn't there.  

On my last day at the apartment, and Walter comes out of his apartment.  He stands in the door way, silent, glaring at me.  I bring my wife the food and tell her to eat quickly because we're leaving as soon as she finishes.

I don't even want to know what would have happened to me if I had stayed another day in that complex.

6 months into the school year, blue eyes, chubby, in his fifties.

""Of course

He looks over, no problem."" I watched him drive away, noting how bright his tail lights are.

It wasn't until later that I realized his car was on the wrong side of the road

For the next few months, a car would drive past me and stop at the end of the block, presumably for the stop sign. I would glance at the back of the car and wonder why cars in my neighborhood all look the same. I pay it no mind.

2 months into my sophomore year, ""Do you know where Union Turnpike is?""

""Yeah

""What? Go left?""

""No you can't because next block's a one way-""

""Wait

*Is this guy dense?* I walk closer to his car

""You have to drive down the street ahead first before you can make a left, stroking up and down. Look back up, his blue eyes are staring right at me, just the most nonchalant expression except for that piercing stare. I freeze, pretend I didn't see it.

""Yeah just that way."" Speed walk the fuck to my house.

My dad was home early that day and happened to look out the window as I was walking home, it was on the wrong side of the road.""

""Um

I told him, I thought nothing of it. Being a girl in New York City, you tend to meet tons of creepy people. *It's no big deal*, I said. *I bet the police get this all the time anyways, flashers everywhere*, I said.

But sometimes I would still think of it and get all indignant

**TWO YEARS LATER**, halfway down the block from my house...when that fucking car pulls up again. I tense up. I recognize it. 

""Hey

""**NO**."" I stare right at him and said it loudly

He looked startled, motherfucker.*

I put all the pieces together and realized, and he knew where my house is. I went straight to the police and reported everything.

About 2 months later, only this time it's cream colored and parked in front of a house. A house I would walk past every single day.

I don't know what the police did with my report, but to merely scare. There are people like him who target young girls, and gets off on startling them and feeling big and powerful. I've seen him one more time since then, walking past his house and he was on his balcony. I paused a little, stared right at him and maintained eye contact. *I dare you.*

My sister was 6, and our mom just loved to dress us in matching outfits. We went to the same school, which was about a 15 minute walk from our house. There were 2 wooded areas in between our house and the school. We were allowed to walk alone, being a military zone and all. We were supposed to stick to the road, but we just *loved* going through the woods. 

One day a guy in a red truck was driving down the road and was trying to get us to talk to him. We were very sternly taught not to talk to strangers so we stayed pretty far back and eventually he left. But then we started to see him all the time. 

We would see him on the way to school. He would show up at the park and talk to all of the kids. Eventually I learned his name and he wasn't so scary anymore. Just that friendly guy who actually gave us kids the time of day. So I started talking about him at home. My mom checked with our neighbours and other kids' parents and none of them knew who this guy was. So she told us not to talk to him anymore. So we stopped.

Then he disappeared

1367777524.0,1dqpu3,Coconut Boy,cadeea,117,27,16,"When working the last shift at a grocery store

The year was 2006, and was located just a seven minute walk from my old apartment, which was pretty sweet. You get some pretty interesting characters coming through, from the suburban yuppie yoga moms to homeless hippies with a penchant for pilfering. It's a pretty diverse crowd and, being one of the few health food stores in Tucson at the time, we tended to attract a lot of regulars. This isn't necessarily a good thing.


At this time, even if it took you fifteen minutes to do it. This naturally attracted a lot of assholes who took advantage of it, but hey. “You piss off one customer, and they’ll tell nine of their friends to stop shopping at the store.” *Well,* you think, *if they’re anything like the original customer, then* **good**! You may have guessed that my opinions did not exactly jive with management’s. 


This particular customer was the exception, almost tinged blue, and giant red slabs for lips that he’d slurp the strangest concoctions with. His hair was dark and curly and his eyes fishdead and hooded. He came and sat at the juice bar right around closing time each night. I think he may have planned it. I always like to take apart the juicer and let it soak before close because beet, carrot, and spinach particles are hellua hard to get off the blades. When I’d reassemble the machine, he’d be there. With 4lbs of produce for me to juice.


He had done enough weird things during the day to piss even my store director, because of the whole coconuts he’d bring over from the produce section for us to open. We were always pretty busy, and this jackass would slam his coconuts on the countertop and demand to be taken care of first. Al happened to be within earshot one time, and decided it would be better for everyone if I gave him my knife and he opened the coconuts himself. At this point, both of us behind the counter looked incredulously at Al, then at CB. Surely he couldn’t be serious…


Oh but he was, surprisingly, was quite a bit). One of the yoga yuppies nearly had her eye put out as he was doing this *at the crowded bar*. Realizing his error, Al then tried to wrestle the knife away from CB before a potential lawsuit could unfurl and sternly told us to ***never*** give CB a knife again. Typical.


So Coconut Boy was already on management’s shitlist when he came in the next day, and will not, under any circumstance, juice his veggies. At this point, he goes creepy. Smacking his lips, he comes behind the counter and tries to pick up the blender. Starts saying what a nice blender it is, and if he could take it home. Kate, loses it and tells him to get the fuck out. She had to push him out of the juice bar and explain why customers are not allowed back there. During this, if the customer would like a fruit smoothie. I was giving my best f-u smile at this time.


Well, jicama, red peppers, an unpeeled bulb of garlic, cabbage, kale, and some other funky veggies that I couldn’t identify. I told him that I needed to add water for it to blend properly, I said yes. End result? A fibrous mass of compost that both looked and smelled repulsive. Feeling a bit petulant at this time


He tried to slurp it up with the straw, making for several very disgusting sounds and a huge mess. Smears of green-purple goo slid down his chin while making eye contact with both Kate and myself. Horrified with the mess he was making, the frontend manager finally told him to leave. He argued with her about it because he hadn’t finished, but she had her way and he was out the side set of doors in a matter of minutes. At this time, it was 20 past close, and we were hustling to get everything cleaned up so we could go home.


Kate finished before me. She had jumped in her beat-up red jeep with zebra seat covers (with a sexy Jesus bobble head on the dash) and booked it back to her place. Being the last one out, so I nodded goodnight to her and set off.


My path home took me past Zia’s, so I always felt reasonably safe taking it late at night. At that hour, there are no other pedestrians on the street because all of the shops are closed, and all of the bars are further down the road. Even so, I am always on alert. Being a slender, young white girl with a pretty face feels akin to being a plump gazelle in a room full of hungry lions when you’ve lived in this neighborhood. You can say what you want, or that I’m being a paranoid white woman crying rape whenever I bump elbows with a stranger


That being said, but I felt hairs on my arms start to prickle. It had an odd gait, and started loping after me once it saw my head turn. By then, the figure had come under one of the walkway lights and I saw my old buddy CB with the freakiest deadpan expression on his face charging towards me. **With a coconut in each hand.**


At that point, because I zigzagged through the parking lot and took a back path off the main street, jumping over concrete pylons into the empty lot behind the shopping complex. I whipped my head to look behind and could still see him galloping through the parking lot after me. Thoroughly freaked out now, I jolted down a little side alley between some duplexes and encountered a chain link fence. Normally, I’d turn around and find another way, but I was up and over that fence in a matter of seconds and sliding on gravel as felt my shoes *levitate* half-way down the street. I don’t remember how I got home from that point, I think my brain was on autopilot


The next morning I firmly told the store director that I would be filing a restraining order. Surprisingly enough, and I haven’t heard from him since. The end.



TL;DR: Annoying customer turns into Creepazoid and charges after me with coconuts on my way home.

Onward to the story! A little info about me: I live in a somewhat affluent apartment complex that's just a mile or two away from my college campus. I'm 22, Ty, and our roommate (the friend that recommended me post this story here) Jess. 

Jess is often at her boyfriend's apartment every night (which is across the city

Anyway, so I was sitting in the living room, doing my homework in the dark while watching a movie. It was something over Existentialist novels. I don't know. Boring shit.

I was engrossed in the paper, because I was listening to the movie and distracted all at the same time. So it didn't really register. Then I heard more knocking. Immediately, the first thing I did was mute the volume. I listened.

More knocking. Instantly

I didn't answer it, and the peephole was covered with some Halloween decoration. I waited for a bit, then I heard the neighbors leave, walking in front of my door. Two girls, laughing about something. I thought that it wasn't anything/anyone bad, so I opened the door.

It was a guy, had a bit of scruff. (Who am I kidding? He was hot.) I was stunned. He looked at me (we were the same height), and then got this dreamy look on his face. 

I asked him if he was looking for someone. He replied, so I just told him the whole situation with his job. The guy nodded, smiled, and thanked me. He went away, walking down the stairs. I shut (and locked!) the door, and went back to my paper.

About 20 minutes later, and I could hear people out and about. So, thinking it was one of my neighbors inviting me to a party, I opened the door.

Same guy. Standing there

""Can I help you?"" I asked

""Do you know when Ty gets off?"" He was looking past me

I told the guy I didn't know, but didn't leave right away.

""I really like Daniel Day Lewis, trying to be polite, and bid him goodnight. I watched him leave again.

I was starting to get creeped out, and call security if he comes back a third time. 

I started to feel a little panicked, when there's another knock. It's more urgent. My pulse suddenly increased, and I felt my skin crawling.

Then the knocking stopped. I felt relieved, trying to look out the window. The next thing I know, there's a big BANG from the other side. Like some brute force was being thrown against the door. I was in utter terror, falling back onto the couch. The guy kept ramming himself against the door, then he stopped. 

I was already on the phone with security

I could hear the guy ramming himself against the bedroom door, hoping my neighbors would hear. The 911 operator was telling me to calm down and tell me where I lived. I told her exactly where I was, multiple times, over and over. I heard glass shatter from the living room.

Then I heard *two voices* talking. Then sirens. I remember hearing one guy say to the other

Then

Then there was scattering, and I had managed to get myself under the bed somehow. I stayed that way until the police showed up. I refused to open the door until one of them (what a sweetheart!!) put his badge under the door so I'd believe them. 

Turns out they stole my laptop, and a few other odds and ends. It was treated as a robbery, and they did all of the dusting for fingerprints thing and stuff. They didn't find anything.

Ty, two guys were arrested breaking into a house about 15 miles away from our apartment complex. Our TV, blu ray player, and other items were discovered with them.

When I first moved here, I have come to appreciate the live and let live attitude that most Seattle residents have. It's very zen and perpetuates a very good atmosphere of creativity, and when you DO talk to people it makes for intellectual and intriguing conversation.

But we have a seedy underground - many, often they will still wish you a good day with a smile. Occasionally they are aggressive, but if you break out of your Seattle character and act overbearing right back at them, they will slither back into their holes in confusion.

I went on national student exchange to another college halfway across the country just to see what I was made of.  I found a place to stay on craigslist despite all of my friends and family telling me it was a bad idea.  It was an old house with a sinking foundation, I hope to never see again.

The guy living in the basement, just dancing with a bunch of dudes in the living room.  The only girls I ever saw him bring home were still in high school, and he was 22.  He made his money by buying and selling things on craigslist (read: stealing and selling).  When I got there he sold me what amounted to hay that he called pot, which I never accused him of because, like i said, I knew no one.  He was always bringing over the sketchiest people, some that couldn't even form a proper sentence, but boy was I wrong.

A few months in I was sleeping around midnight when someone came in my room.  This was not uncommon as ten people lived there at that time and drunk friends were always coming over to see someone.  I asked this stranger to get out of my room and find his friend Mike and he left.  About fifteen minutes later I got up to pee and I passed him in the living room next to mine (we had around 4 living rooms) reading an encyclopedia from a couple decades prior.  He never broke his gaze from my eyes as I passed him twice.  Never said a word to me, expecting nothing to happen.

I woke up the next morning and got ready for class, a couple, were living on the third floor and never wanted anyone up there.  At the time Kevin was growing a single marijuana plant  and wanted it to be a secret.  I immediately thought someone had tried to climb the railing, but we had tried before when we were drunk so again I didn't think anything of it.  After I got back from class I heard the whole story.

Kevin and Mary had woken up around six in the morning and had been fooling around for about an hour or so.  Kevin said he saw his closet door open halfway where his plant was and he always closed this for obvious reasons.  He didn't think anything of it.  They fell asleep and woke up again around 9:30.  Mary got up to go to the bathroom

""It looks like someone tried to climb up here last night

Kevin came out to check.  ""It does.""  He went back into the room

""What the fuck are you doing?!"" Kevin said

""Whoa calm down man

""No you're not

""Wait

This guy was around 6'5"" and built, including in college, and knew how to handle a fight.  The guy went down hard and immediately bounced back up.  Scared at how the hit caused nearly no reaction, Kevin screams ""Get the fuck out of my room!""  The guy was backing out trying to calm Kevin down.  

""Come on dude, ""I need to bless your plant.  Are you a christian?""

Kevin hits him again, the guy was still tugging on his erect ""monster cock,"" even through being punched in the face twice.  Kevin got him to the attic stairs and pushed him down them.  These stairs were about half the size of normal stairs and ended with a doorway about half the size of a normal one.

The guy finally let go of himself after one more punch to the face and being kicked down the stairs to the first floor, the end of which had a banister that ended with a flat piece of wood on top with a very sharp corner, which he caught at full tumble in the middle of his back.  Kevin said the sound his back created made him think he had killed him, or at the very least broke something.  After laying motionless for a second the guy still staggered to his feet and Kevin pushed him out the front door.

The guy, naked as the day he was born, he said ""Come on, dude.  I'm naked.""  For a brief moment, Kevin felt sorry for him.  That moment quickly passed.  ""Fuck you!""  he said, and slammed the door.

We found out from the cops later that the guy had ran to a school across the street.  Someone there saw him and gave him some shorts, which he did.  The naked guy, as far as I know, is still in a psychiatric hospital.

This took place in Germany in the mid 70's on a caravan park where each plot  had a low wooden fence and the caravans and fore-tents were well maintained. Also these were long term plots were most people owned their caravan and all the families knew each other. Everyone was only there for the weekend or holidays.

I was about 6 or 7 at the time and the other girl

We were told not to let anyone in under any circumstances [something you only have to tell me once and I would obey as if programmed. However other kids are not like me and this is where the problem arose.

Anyway. There were two guys who had a caravan that nobody liked, swearing in front of us kids and they looked like tramps and smelled like tramps. People only just tolerated them but one lovely summer morning we woke up with them staring at us through the open back window of our caravan, giving us a shock and causing my dad to lose it and run after them to beat the shit out of them but they had legged it.

This little interlude is so that you know what weirdos we were dealing with.

So that night my friend and I were locked in [from the inside], eating snacks and generally having a good time.
Then we heard someone knocking on the door. We immediately kept quiet and didn't do anything but they knocked again

I remember distinctly feeling frightened for my life
Foolish thing to say but we were really small and frightened.
So teh it got worse

This is where my friend whose caravan it was lost it and opened the door even though I was screaming not to do it.

They slung the door open and came in and seriously I thought that we would get murdered [yes I was only a kid but I was already reading horror comics - and seriously that was what kept me alert
They came in and sat right next to us on the U-shaped bench around the table

Eventually my self preservation won and I started screaming. I screamed really loudly ""Help"" ""Help us"" and just scream my lungs out. The two men got really annoyed but I recon now

They told me to ""shut up"" and shouted other stuff, they got up and legged it. Maybe because they knew that the immediate neighbour had heard and was on the way.

I closed the door and had a go at my friend for opening it. Minutes later our parents turned up, they eventually told me they believed me.

Anyway, which was fenced and had a log cabin guard house with a barrier you had to get past. Maybe they even involved the Police. All I know is that the adults were taking it well seriously.

Years later I understand in how much danger we really were in and how lucky we were and how much I am glad that I started screaming when I did.",,t5_2t3t8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/197km6/caravans_just_as_bad_as_trailers/
1361291923.0,18tp8w,His name was Davey...Part 3,NameUnavailable12345,142,49,13,"After some time, however

Jay and Jamie were the sweetest kids in the world, angered Davey(bc how dare I do something without him) so I didn't do it often. But I always enjoyed those times with Jay and Jamie. They really did feel like my little brother and sister. We were pretty close knit. However, Davey saw this as an excuse to make sure he was around more and more and before long, we had become inseparable. 

It got to the point where I was literally in Tennessee half the week and Georgia the other half. So I decided to make the move to Tennessee. Lacey had already hooked me up with a new job, he was estatic and couldn't wait until I was just 30min away rather than 2hrs. He kept going on about how we could finally spend every single day together. At one point crying, saying he could stop suffering.

We'd been dating for about 6mos at this point and it was about 3wks before the big move when we had our first really big argument. Davey had been ignoring my texts and calls for a few days and only giving small replies. Thinking he was mad at me

Of course, Davey would lose his shit and call me a fucking bitch or a lying cunt then accuse *me* of cheating. Just horrible awful stuff really. But what did stupid me do? Oh you guessed it, I stayed with him. (Fucker did cheat on me btw)

When the big moving day came around

We got in a fight in the car, but talking. The argument lasted all the way up the interstate and I'd finally just given up on trying to reason with him. When we were almost home, we came to a pretty major intersection between two four lane roads. Lacey came to a stop at the light in front of us and Davey was too busy cursing me out to notice. I looked up just in time to see Davey looking away from the road and Lacey's SUV getting closer and closer. I went rigid and tried to say something, anything...but it was too late.

We slammed into the back of Lacey's car. Both cars were sent into the middle of the intersection where we were instantaneously T-boned by oncoming traffic. All my windows, glass shattering, and the sound of metal crumpling. 

For some reason, just severely bruised. I had a long bruise from my hip to shoulder from the seat belt. My belly button piercing was ripped out and my right ear was pretty cut up. I had some glass stuck in various cuts on the side of my head and arms and, naturally, a large amount of whiplash. Lacey's and Davey's airbags went off so they weren't quite as battered, but they did end up getting some pretty bad airbag burns.

In that accident, I had basically just moved to a new town only to lose my car. I still ended up getting a check from insurance for a new car even though Davey was driving. (Don't ask me how, my dad handled it all and I've never wanted to know if the check really was from insurance or not.) I did not break up with Davey after that, in fact I became more dependent on him until I got a new car. I think I thought the trauma of the accident would pull us closer together and fix all our problems. For a few days, maybe even a week, it did. I was starting to see the old Davey again. But it all changed very quickly.

Davey developed some type of PTSD after the accident. I mean, deleted his facebook, essentially just disappeared for a week. Nobody could get ahold of him, not even Jay or Jamie. I reached out to some his friends and none of them had heard from him either and were even more surprised when I hadn't heard from either. 

This is how I got very close to Davey's friend Mark. Mark was quirky and weird

After about a week and a half, ""I needed some space for a few days."" and didn't understand why I was so worried. Things went on shakily, but somewhat back to normal after that. But I had began to notice the change in Davey though and was fearful of the person he was becoming. 

His room that had been oh-so clean was filthy. Like we're talking pigsty. Davey would spill drinks or food and just leave it. There was bacteria growing in multiple cups, some of it on the floor. You couldn't see his floor at all. There were piles upon piles of clothes, blankets, shoes, towels, trash(pizza boxes, soda cartons, and just utter filth. Jay

Davey was angry all the time

For example, threw the shoe at the wall as hard as he could then threw my purse for good measure. He shoved me back which made me trip and fall, then screamed in my face to ""Get the fuck out!"" I just froze up, unable to move. After a few minutes, Davey calmed down and apologized for yelling, telling me I should be more careful next time and know better than to be ignorant. I left shortly after that and we didn't hang out for a few more days. 

The next time I saw him, but basically Jamie had insulted his driving somehow. He started yelling and screaming at Jamie while we're driving down the highway. Jamie burst into tears and I'm begging him to calm down as I'm already having flashbacks to the car accident. 

Davey then proceeds to scream at me and go on about how the car accident was my fault. How I was the fucking bitch who distracted him and if my dumbass hadn't gotten him angry then the accident wouldn't have happened. At this point, I'm pretty sure you're the one who rear ended the other car. So why don't you shut the fuck up, stop blaming your girlfriend, and stop yelling at our sister. Nobody here is a perfect driver, especially not you. Now pay attention to the fucking road before you kill us.""",,False,t5_2t3t8,True

It was a late night in December I just finished finals and the semester was over. I was really excited to head home for the first time all semester to see my folks. My parent’s house was about an hour away from my college so the drive isn’t too bad, but something was off about him. He had sunglasses on at night which I thought was odd. He had an extremely pale face and he seemed to be laughing. His face would never turn away and he continued to stare at me. The traffic light seemed like it would never change. 


Finally the light turns green and I press the gas like there’s no tomorrow. As you might have guessed this strange man begins to follow me. No matter how fast I go. He doesn’t take his eyes off me and we’re driving excessive speeds on this empty road side by side. Everything was happening so fast and so I thought of turning onto a random road to lose this guy. He continues follows me. My heart sinks. I panic. I don’t know what to do or where to go. I decide to pull into a driveway at a random house to see if he’d leave. He pulls up from behind and proceeds to get out of the vehicle. He runs towards me this time his smile vanishes and he’s instead crying. He begins to bang on my window sobbing and screaming. I back out and bolt out of there. He doesn’t follow me this time

1354859184.0,14fik6,The Man in the Yard,discominx666,106,14,24,"[I've been procrastinating so hard the past several hours reading these stories when I should be writing a paper

Me:  Female
Setting:  Nice neighborhood

One of my biggest fears is someone breaking into my home.  I'm an extremely light sleeper, anything otherwise disturbing the darkness and silence as I sleep, will wake me.  My parents live in a neighborhood that is very nice, very wealthy, heavily wooded with houses quite close to one another until you reach the end of it, where our house was located.  The houses are a bit further a part, and until recently, and there aren't mature trees

Preface of sorts:

When I was in high school, mid-piss, he sort of freaked out, saying he saw someone walking around the backyard.  He quickly adjusted himself, closed the window, and I took a look out back.  I could vaguely see an outline of someone surveying the property, almost near the deck.  I panicked, sort of storms out to the deck

Two more bizarre instances occurred.  The second one, well after my dad went to sleep, my boyfriend left, and I watched as he slowly made his way through the dark yard.  I could see his mother's car in the distance.  Abruptly, I saw his figure gain speed, swiftly walking until he broke out in a sprint toward the headlights.  I was confused, but assumed that he was eager to get to her car.  As soon as her car took off, he called me on his mother's cell phone

Fast forward to 3 years later, I noticed that something wasn't right with the yard lamp out front.  My curtains are quite thin, so a change in the light was noticeable.  I pulled them slightly open and saw what appeared to be a person standing in front of it, to where they were blocking the glow.  Then, a red cloth was thrown over the light.  I was terrified, not knowing what the hell was going on, so I threw my books, and woke him up.  He looks out the front windows near the door, looks around, thinking it was some kind of marker or symbol for something.  I'll add that after washing the towel

The Story of Stories:

I wanted to include the above instances to give you an idea of how I developed my anxiety and general uneasiness about prowlers, etc.  This instance occurred over the summer, when I was again staying at my parents' house for a few months before moving to another city.  As I said, I'm a very light sleeper, and the curtains that my mother put up in my bedroom are nearly sheer.  It was about 3 a.m., and I was fast asleep.  The sound of a vehicle stirred me awake, and I saw the glare of headlights out front through the curtains.  I immediately sat up and opened the curtains.  It was a truck that was sitting out front of the driveway and then started to drive on slowly.  I assumed it was the paper deliverer and was about to collapse back into bed when I saw them abruptly hit the breaks a few feet away from our driveway.  From their headlights, and then sped off.  I watched, I could make out the person walking in our yard, with a purpose.  I shot outta bed

My mother and I were both unable to sleep.  We kept a look out on our neighbors' houses.  In a few hours

The next night both of my parents loaded their gun of choice and kept it near their side of the bed.  I took a xanax with a big glass of wine.  Then I moved away anyway.  

I'll be back home next week, I started to feel a bit nostalgic and unnerved.  I don't know what the hell to make of all these experiences.  I'll never not be terrified of the prospect of a home invasion or any sort of lurker.  I'm far more conscious of this than my parents; I make sure all windows and doors are locked no matter what.  These experiences have only proved to me how important it is to do this no matter how secure you feel in your community.

Anyway, huge nosedive. He starts telling me about his lying wife putting a restraining order on him and says something to the effect of, ""If I wanted to hurt that bitch she wouldn't be breathing."" And then he talks about his sister taking custody of his daughter from him a long time ago, saying she was lying too and ""What kinda nasty woman is that."" Not only were these subjects just awfully personal and random, but he was becoming extremely agitated as he spoke. He was sitting in one of our rocking chairs at this point and he was asking for water so I went in and grabbed a bottle, thinking that he might leave once he got it. Sarah was on the phone with her dad, an influential car dealership owner with a lot of connections, I was going to give him water and tell him to leave.

But he just kept on talking. He told me that he was certified crazy and in and out of mental hospitals. He said he couldn't legally buy guns anymore but that he had some in the truck he'd had for a long time and asked me if I wanted to come see them. At this point, knowing it'd be at least a half hour/45 minutes before they'd get there. We live so far out that a fast response is impossible.

I didn't come back outside, ""You need to leave, you're scaring the girls,"" and the guy walks away from the house and starts pacing, arguing with her dad and saying that he didn't do anything wrong. Sarah's dad keeps telling him that he understands but he really needs to leave. A while into this conversation, the cops rip up the driveway and start talking to him. One of them gets the story from Sarah and I and then they're both down there talking to him again.

I can hear the guy saying he wants to sit down. It's a hot day and I could see why. Anyway, knocks him over his leg, and sends him backwards down the hill from the driveway. The guy falls on the back of his neck and starts crying. They cuff him and tell him that they told him not to move and that he needs to listen. I felt horrible because I thought that was excessive force. The guy was trying not to let the cops get a word in edgewise and kept just trying to rant the same way he did with me but they were firmer with him.

When he was in the car, I'm sure I'd be long dead by the time the cops showed up if he really meant me harm.

I told my sister to hurry up and tried to get my dog to go faster, but my dog was old and overweight and kept having to stop. I never took my eyes off the man.

We hadn't gotten much further along the path when I see him break away from whatever was he was staring at in the water. He spun towards us and started walking. His walk was a little strange. It had a robotic rigidity to it that made it seem like he was heavily medicated. My gut told me something wasn't right

""Hello?""

""Mom. There's someone following us home from the park. Please hurry.""

""I'm on my way.""

I looked back. The man was still power-walking towards us. We had almost reached a field that we could cross to reach a road that runs parallel to the path. I knew we had to get to that road. The man was gaining on us because our dog kept stopping, but he couldn't. The man was coming quickly, and I made a difficult choice. We left my dog and ran for the road. 

Once we reached the road, we set off towards my house once more.

So did he. He walked along the path and it became increasingly wooded. Then, he facial expression focused and unchanging. At that moment, I see my mom come around the corner behind him. She's holding a baseball bat, swinging it menacingly. He caught sight of her out of the corner of his eye and veers in the opposite direction as if nothing happened.

We live in a crummy little mining town and there's nothing for teens to do so most of them go to the woods on a Friday night and drink. We knew most of the places where these parties were happening but we were content to hang out alone in the near-dark. My girlfriend said she wanted to wander a bit

The announcements of the game got quiet and I could hear her footsteps, but she wasn't booking it and I figured she scared herself and then calmed down.

Then came her voice doing the whispered yell for me. That sound where your voice is raspy, they were facing us. When they would turn their heads you could see the fire showing on their faces and I got uncomfortable. 

Now I was a decent fighter, just the light from it, so if anyone was on the other side, we wouldn't notice them until they were charging us. Then, just as I'd stopped next to her one of the spoke up and yelled ""Who the fuck is that? If you're Julian I'm gonna fucking gut you!"" And then they charged at us. 

I was basically stunned for a second at whatever was going on so all I could do was stand in front of her to keep her safe. That's about when I noticed the one yelling was carrying a nice size combat knife and he was running down the hill straight toward me. So I'd love to say I got brave and yelled at him threatening things, you gotta speak up, I was gonna kill you"". And we kinda laughed it off and he gave me a beer and then the girlfriend and I hit the road. I was told when he was drunk he'd show a lot of anger, but I'd never actually gotten drunk with him, so I figured it was just the metal-head in him coming out. I hadn't thought about it much, my friend being one for showing off as a tough guy but never following through.

A year passed and it was New Years eve. A different friend and I were in his house playing Dungeons and Dragons, as it was about 2am. We dismissed it as maybe a fire or something, the usual shit in a little town. The next day, my buddy Brandon is all over the front of the newspaper. Apparently he'd gotten drunk with a bunch of people, one of whom being Julian. Julian had said something Brandon didn't like and Brandon stabbed him in the stomach. fortunately, he was with people that stopped him after one stab and Julian survived, but spent a few weeks in the hospital.

I live on a pretty populated street, I have no worries about walking at night, because the streets are well lit, and there are always people around. But this one night... 

This one night. 

I had spent most of the day on the couch. I was hungover, and the streets were always busy at night. Phoned my order in, got dressed, and stepped into... a ghost town. All the restaurants on my street were closed. And the street-lights were out. Darkness. The only light came from a hair-dressing salon 2 doors down, that was obviously hosting some kind of function.

But no problem! My area is safe! I walked down the road, some guy tries to stop me. 6ft2, crazy hat, no worries. Bitch shields engaged. I ignore him. But then, as I'm walking home... The hackles raise on my neck. I glance behind me. He's shadowing me. I know I am facing a dark road back to mine. And this dude is behind me. He's bigger than me (I'm a girl). I start to worry.But maybe I'm over-reacting? I pass one of the few restaurants that is open. Duck in. Wait for him to pass. NOPE. 

I glance out. He's chatting to a car guard. An immediate feeling of relief. I have clearly misread this situation

I speed up. He speeds up. I loiter, so there are sidings and crannies. I thought about calling someone to come pick me up, but it felt a little ridiculous. So I made a plan. 

To get to my road, blocks the view of anyone following you. I put my keys between my fingers (a makeshift knuckleduster for surprise throat-punching) The minute I rounded the corner, I took off running. Headed for the middle of the street (figured any abduction would be more noticeable if he had to wrestle me off the street). I ran until I hit the hair salon. Endured some weird looks. But when I looked back, the guy I was worried about was stepping out of the alley behind the construction siding. He looked really angry. GCB 1, Creeper 0

But instead she asks in Spanish: 

*""Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?""*

I'm an atheist but I'm not vocal about it and I don't really enjoy debating people. It's a personal choice for me and I didn't want to speak with anyone about it

*I don't want or need your help. Please just leave me alone. You are bothering me.*

When the police arrived, they grabbed her and escorted her away from my car and into their police car. She screamed at them to let her go and kept babbling about being on a mission from God to save souls. She condemned them to Hell several times before they closed the door to their car. The policemen came over and took my statement. After we finished, he told me that this was the third time she was being detained for harassment. I commented that she needed some help and then I went home.

Hi folks.  Here are a few stories from my time in Italy several years ago.  I am a 5' 10” female with light colouring, it is not uncommon for foreign girls to get pretty heavily creeped on, verbally harassed, followed, and generally bothered by overzealous men.  
These are my experiences.  Thankfully they aren't too traumatic

The first story takes place in one of Rome's busiest nightlife hot spots, strict boarding school and moved to Italy by myself.  Naturally, I thought I was badass, streetwise, and invincible, and didn't give a single solitary fuck.  

So moving on.  My friends and I are at a bar, and we are merrily chatting away, when I notice a creepy guy—mid-to-late thirties, grizzled stubble, muscular build, with a scary-looking studded leather jacket and boots.  He was standing away from the crowd, watching my friends and I.  Just staring.  Now, so we just ignored him and continued having a good time.  I didn't see him any more after a while so I figured he just went off to creep on someone else.  
The guys we were talking to had some hash, passing the joint and chatting, when I notice the guy again.  He is sitting directly behind one of my friends, just staring.  Not saying a word or moving a muscle.  He did this for about five minutes, and then moved on to my next friend.  My pals were just ignoring him and giving him uncomfortable looks.  One of the sassier ones told him to buzz off, but none of them spoke Italian, so they just tried their best to pretend he wasn't there.  

He stood next to every single one of my friends like that (there were five of us), but were morons and far too absorbed in chatting up my friends to take any real notice of some random weirdo in the public square (there wasn't exactly a shortage of oddballs there to begin with; strange behaviour was generally ignored unless it escalated).  Anyway, it gets to my turn, and being the nippy little radgie that I was, I confront him.  The following conversation happened in Italian, so none of my friends knew what we were saying.  

Me:  What are you looking at?

Creeper: *no reply*  

Me:  If you don't get away from me

Creeper: *no reply*

Me:  *pulls out pepper spray* Do you know what this is?  Cos it sure the fuck ain't gonna freshen your breath.  What do you want from me? 

Creeper: (in a very

Me:  Excuse me?  What the fuck did you just say?

Creeper:  I SAID I WANT TO FUCK YOU

Just as he started screaming he lunged forward, and pressed his nose against mine.  
I lost it.
I pushed him back with all my weight, giving him one last blast in the eyes and nose, and spitting on his face.  Then I backhanded him, hard, and hauled ass to the nearest bar.  There was a cover to get in, so I explained to the bouncer what had happened and that I needed to wash the pepper spray off my hands.  He let me and all my mates in, no questions, and called the cops. The guy was taken away

TL:DR  A crazy guy creepily and wordlessly followed my friends and I, culminating in him screaming that he wanted to fuck me and grabbing my crotch as hard as he could.  I pepper spray him and GTFO. Good guy bouncer gives refuge to my friends.

1364351218.0,1b33rw,Stranger in a supermarket,gabyfoxx,115,27,13,"I was about ten years old at the time

This supermarket was generally empty

I get to near the end of the store when I notice a man who seemed huge at the time (Can't pinpoint a specific height due to being ten years old and incredibly short, bald, tall, but incredibly muscular. He was on the phone so I just ignored him a bit more.

Scanning a few more shelves my paranoia just wouldn't stop bugging me

I *again* just tried to ignore it

**He was describing me.** Height, body features, he pointed out sexual features as well-my ass, my thighs, he described how I walked, what I was wearing, I was terrified. Was he gonna kidnap me? Kill me? Rape me? Was I gonna see my parents again? I couldn't tell if I was just paranoid again or if any of those threats were real. I remember scanning the store to see if anyone was around and I could stand by them or something, I remembered every bit of advice my parents had given if encountered with a situation like this. Scream

I just quickened my pace to test him once more

She asked me where the croutons were

I never told anyone that. I don't know why, or said something at the spot because god knows if that guy ever did end up snatching a kid at a grocery store. It wasn't until I was 15 that I told my mom what happened.  


I was 10. I was 10 fucking years old. Even today I wonder what would've happened if I didn't run that instant,False,,t5_2t3t8,1364351485.0,,,t3_1b33rw
1347127323.0,zkbao,Encounter on the back roads,hanncamp,159,68,31,"This happened about 3 years ago when I was a senior in high school. My (now ex) boyfriend and I were in the car. We went to meet another couple at the movies after a basketball game just to kill some time. 












We were all bored and none of us wanted to go home. We went to the 10:30 showing of Dear John (which by the way I fell asleep in. I didn't care for romantic movies much and the only good part had to be Channing Tatum.) Anyways...the movie ended and we all piled into our cars. I had to take my boyfriend home because he didn't have his license yet. 



















I hated the back roads but they were much quicker than going through town and most likely being stopped at every single red light. He lived out in the middle of absolutely no where. We were about five minutes away from his house when my headlights revile a young woman standing in the road frantically waving her arms flagging me down. 






















It's about midnight at this point and I'm wondering if maybe possibly her car broke down. I felt nothing wrong with this situation so I pulled over to the side of the road. I might want to mention in advance that I am so fucking stupid for doing this. She rushes up to the car and asks if we can give her a lift. She tells us that her boyfriend and her got in a fight and he forced her out of his car and she was walking home. She still had about 10 miles to go. I felt bad for her but I was still suspicious. I told her she could use my cell phone if she needed to and then made up the excuse that I didn't have enough gas to get her where she wanted to go. She said she would give me money and then out of nowhere she starts looking at me and smiling. She kept repeating things like Oh my god! I know you!! I remember























Out of nowhere a man comes out from the wooded area next to the road. This guy was huge. He looked like a security guard that you would see with like Beyonce or something protecting her from the paparazzi. I was frozen. My boyfriend slowly took his cell phone from his pocket and dialed 911. He hit my hood and demanded I get out of the car or he was going to pull a gun on me. I snapped back into reality and put my car in reverse. I swerved around the man and woman as tears were pouring out of my eyes. The adrenaline had finally gotten to me and I realized we had just gotten out of something that could have been a very awful ending for us. 























We reached my boyfriends house and waited for the police. They took our information and we told them what happened. They made their way back to the spot and found burlap sacks, rope and a camera. They also found tire marks where a car had been parked in a wooded area. 


















What did they want with *us*? I most likely will never find out. This has to be the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. But I am so happy I got out safe and alive.
