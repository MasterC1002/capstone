1339917168.0,v66sg,Hi everyone going through a breakup must read this inspirational post. It changed me post breakup and most importantly gave me hope. ,angrygorilla89,379,43,88,"

So,"" or ""Will my ex come back,"" or ""Why did he/she do this,"" this is how it typically goes down. 

You two break up--doesn't matter who does it. You immediately panic and begin chasing, harrassing, phoning, e-mailing, IMing, stalking (okay not all of them, just pick whichever one you did). Most of us will likely do some things during this stage that will make you cringe when you think back on it

You lose weight. You neglect yourself, forgetting all of the nagging things about them that used to drive you crazy. In your mind, they have become omnipotent, all encompasing, all everything. 

You convince yourself that you are a loser who just screwed up a relationship with ""the best person in the world."" You KNOW without a doubt that you will never EVER love like that again. You know no one else will come along who even comes close to being as marvelous as your ex (excuse me while I chuckle to myself here). You wear a sad face for the world to see (you should see my work ID taken 2 days after my breakup

They (the ex's) remain steadfast in their denial to get back together. Many of them leapfrog into new relationships, they now do with someone else. Bowling, cuddling watching television, motorcycle riding, antiquing. Whatever you two did, likely they will just begin doing those things with someone new. 

You hear about them and their new life. You are desperate for any crumbs of news about their life. Many of us make things worse here by trying to use manipulation to get them back--yet they stay away from us like we are the plague. 

For those of us who do still have contact with our ex's we begin selling ourselves short. Doing stupid things like allowing them access to our bodies and then wanting to strangle them afterward when they remind us that ""Sex does not imply hope."" 

You,"" ""divorce stopper,"" whatever. You stumble upon this site, pay your money because your curious and lo and behold, you find all of us folks in various stages of this whole breakup bullsh*t. 

You voraciously read the posts. You search for news of those who ""got their mates back."" You're on the site constantly. You'll read the books and think ""Ah I can do this. I can get this person back."" You begin your ""no contact"" and for some of us

Time goes by. You'll do some stupid things. You'll call your ex when you shouldn't. You'll call when you've had to much to drink. You'll call even after 50 people on this site tell you not to. You'll show up on their doorstep

Then you'll get serious about no contact. It'll hurt

Now's the tough time. Nothing but time works. Everday the ache in your heart grows a little less. It's only nanobits that it dies down by. But everyday it will get slowly better. You'll have setbacks. You'll run into your ex accidently. You'll run into mutual friends who'll tell you something about your ex that'll have you high-tailing it home for a good cry. You'll see your ex with their new ""friend."" You'll receive a phone call or an e-mail from your ex who ""doesn't want to be in a relationship but still wants to be friends (with benefits if you allow). 

Here's another important part. You need to truly sit down and truthfully look back at the relationship and understand what you did to help with it's demise. If you miss this part, a better person. Missing that lesson is detrimental to the whole process. It's the REASON that you're going through this. God (or whatever your higher power is) needed you to learn something about YOU. Don't miss out on the lesson. 

Then one day you'll smile because you didn't immediately check your answering machine when you came in. And one day you'll decide to clean the muck that has accumulated in your house. And one day you'll go outside and admit to the universe that you surrender what control you thought you had. 

And one day you'll decide to date again. And one day you'll go out on your first date and it will likely be a disaster. And then you'll either force yourself to continue dating or you'll decide that you aren't ready to date but you are ready to be out amongst people again. And many of you will have some quick reconcillations with your ex's. Many of us won't. But one day

And for most of us, amigos. Don't want to dash your hopes but probably less than 3% of the people on this site get back with their mates. Sobering isn't it? But, as the site instructs, you must accept this before you can truly begin to heal or draw your ex back to you. For the lucky (maybe unlucky one's depending on how much work it will take to keep a mate that has wandered back) who get back with their ex's, many will find that the paradise they envisioned isn't reality and what they once thought was gold has a certain tarnish to it now. But they stay and try and make it work because it's comfortable or, if they are really lucky, it's meant to be. 

But for most of us. Life goes on. And one day you'll find yourself having a gut busting laugh over something totally stupid and you'll think to yourself ""I am getting better."" And finally (thank God) you'll have sex with some new and find that a) if it wasn't good

I guess what I'm trying to convey here is, when someone tells you on this site that time will help you get through it, believe them. When they tell you that ""trust me, it will get better and you will stop hurting eventually,"" believe them. And when they give you good advice that your head understands but your heart rejects, take a moment to think before you react. 

Don't beat yourself up if you do something that you wished you hadn't (calling, take some time to heal before going back out there. There are plenty of good people to love, but don't go back out there broken, jaded about love, etc. Accept realty. Experience the pain. Learn the lesson. Actively try to heal. Remember the person you were when you first met your ex and get that person back. 

And the universe will take care of the rest.""

1353457687.0,13jez5,Things I wish I knew when I was younger about breakups,ns0,357,50,48,"I hope not to update this in another 5 years

**You are a different person in a relationship
Everyone i've ever dated are generally a slightly different person, suddenly develop new interests, hobbies or attitudes. I now finally accept being in a relationship made me different. I now finally accept it made them different too. I always find a new person after a relationship. For better or worse. Speaking of people changing...

**The person you first met is not who they are now.**
I am well aware I fall in love more with the idea of someone, fleeting or factual is not who they are now.  It's painful to idealize someone more than anything else, I convince myself they were perfect for me, when really, at the end of it, we were terrible together. That's why we're not together. Give this time, and don't try to chase down the idea of them

**Don't try and be friends. At least for a while.**
Forget it, and either they blow up when I begin to date someone, or I blow up when they start to date someone else, or we get back together and the damn thing just repeats itself. Also, there are people, who I can never be friends with again. They were crazy (literally) or just destructive, so I tossed 'em out. I have no responsibility to someone once we've broken up

**Realize when the relationship is over.**
This is often the hardest part to get through. Even though the words ""we're over"" had been said, or knew they were moving on, or I had developed feelings for someone else and started dating again. Note: I said developed feelings, I don't feel this way with rebounds or casual sex. Which brings me to my third point…

**Don't be a relationship jumper
I've done it, sometimes blindsiding them, that this ship is sinking… Thanks for all the memories! And ahoy, i'm climbing into someone else's boat.  I had this happen to me and I can't explain how gut wrenching it is, it makes you feel completely insignificant, inferior, manipulated and lied to.  If you do this FUCK YOU, I would.  Speaking of ass kicking…

**Be kind to yourself.**
OH LORD. I think i'm my worst enemy sometimes.  I will mull over every slight point of the relationship, making myself feel stupid, ugly, worthless. JEEZ. I'm a dick for kicking my own ass so much. Being kind means making changes in how I talk to myself in my ""head"", how I treat myself and doing nice things for myself on a regular basis to remind me that I do care about myself. Speaking of taking care of myself..

**Exercise
Part of being kind to yourself is investing in yourself. Take all that anger, learning something new or somehow enhancing who you are. This is taking care of your self and being kind to yourself all at the same time. DOUBLE WIN. OH, and speaking of unhealthy activities…

**Don't put your emotions into unhealthy activities.**
You know what i'm referring too, casual sex to ""get over them"", drugs, alcohol, etc. These are all just addictive things that I've never found, not once, to help. SURE they delay the pain pretty well, but it'll be back. Sure as shit, and while we're on the topic of drinking...

**BUt
No, write a letter to them then burn it, but I prefer to have some witty dialogue back and forth with fake them.  My subconscious has a way of bringing up things I don't want to approach when imagining them. Speaking of talking to your ex...

**Don't engage contact with them until there's no emotions left**
I don't engage contact with them once were broken up until I honesty, and if so, be careful still, old feelings can crawl up fast. Funny part about this is generally when you're at this point you have no desire to contact them. Now that we're being honest...

**Admit you loved some things about them.**
This is totally optional, about, *zero* things about them. Some I really hated at first, but at the end of a long recovery had to admit I really dug somethings about them, still do.  Keep those with you, they're helpful. It helps you recognize what you want in a relationship. I don't idolize the relationship or them, just a few things that I really liked. But at the same time remember to...

**Admit you hate some things about them.**
I think this is the SECOND most important thing to take away from a relationship, but we'll get to that. Recognizing what I didn't like becomes a checklist to steer clear from. I didn't like being talked down too, it actually really bothered me, I didn't like how she found my playfulness as immature.  On future dates this becomes red flags for me.

**Admit if you had a part in the relationships downfall.**
This is the MOST important part. No sense in me not learning from my own mistakes. Although its rare to have a relationship that is 100% one persons fault for the breakup (or dysfunction) I can honestly say each relationship I made mistakes or learned things about myself and would like to fix that going forward. SO

**They'll always be in your mind.**
If there was a really strong connection I find myself thinking about them a lot. I can say from experience that even after 15 years, nirvana was still a band. Anyway, thankfully it's now just happy memories, and mistakes learned that I don't make anymore. No hate, no bitter feelings, no ""jeez, they're the one that got a way"".  This just takes time for your emotions to pick themselves back up. Give it time

**Get back your identity.**
I have the worst tunnel vision in relationships. I mean, regardless I loose myself in relationships.  When I get out of them I feel completely lost. Like I don't know who I am. But in time, I realize that by being kind to myself and exercising and putting my emotions into healthy activities I slowly regain my sense of self. 

**There are other people.**
I can say from a long history of experience, but also means I'm happier with them.

**Be happy you had the opportunity to feel so high
This always sounds funny for me to say it to myself. But it's true. Being alone or loneliness for me is just fear.  Fear I won't find someone else, once you let go of fear, once you let go of anger, once you let go of all those emotions -- and it will happen one day -- you'll feel gratitude you had these experiences, and that you felt so high.  You'll then appreciate that feeling so good, also means you might feel this bad. So, I in a funny way, because it meant I had the opportunity to feel so great. 

**Disappointment
The hardest part of a breakup for me is not letting go of the bad things but all the good things you had together. The disappointment can be overwhelming. I remember as a child if my father wanted to impress how angry he was he never yelled, myself and my partner the same things over and over again after a breakup. But try and remember its ok to be disappointed, its ok to let go of those things and be wrong. Now finally...

**Admit you were wrong**
Being wrong isn't an emotion, and anger. Anger turns to frustration, frustration turns to desperation. I have a tendency to see being wrong as an inherent fault in myself. I ruminate on how I should have known better. I could have done better. How the hell could I have trusted them. Truth is, if you don't embrace being wrong, treat being wrong with a light heart, you'll drive yourself insane. You could have been wrong about how you felt, how you treated them, whether you actually were in love. You could have been wrong about a million things. These are good things. They're not advisories but guides. They don't expose your fallacies or inferiority. They don't require neurotic examination

1357984565.0,16fjyo,Broke up? Have a read and get better.,asinglefuck,236,31,40,"**BIG EDIT N°3**:  Thank you all for the nice comments and questions. This was a throwaway and I did not expect this post to gather so much attention. Sorry if it's a bit late but I'd like to thank you all and will try to answer some of the loads of messages I got. 

Some suggested for this post to get promoted to a sidebar-like thing on the main subreddit, and not much at all. 

If you like this idea

I mean, to try and help people through small posts or comments. They all got buried and taken down and I feel a bigger document is in order. 

Together we can add our efforts so that people over the internet who feel alone and broken can get support and comfort and can know what is in order for them.

Thank you for your time

So

If so

So, maybe over nothing, or something terrible, or something inconclusive. You need help. I know you're torn between a plea for help and a feeling like a nausea inside that keeps you from reading a great deal. Just skim over and find a point that suits your troubles and read it. Maybe two.

**The reason for the breakup is irrelevant**

You heard me. Don't fret over it. There's always gonna be something that could have been different about why you guys did not work. You can be either the dumped or dumpee. You can be dumped over nothing

In any of these cases, s/he's a dick). Its how people work. We have feelings and our psyches attatch to others. It's like a drug. When the other person is removed forcibly from your day to day, you start missing him/her like crazy. **do not** fret over the reasons or how it could have been different. I know you're gonna do it anyway, but don't kill yourself over it. It couldn't because it's the past. Let it slide.

**Your life is gonna get screwed over for a while**

Yup. The lack of drive and the void left by the other person is gonna do some damage to your routine and sink you into a depressive hole. Maybe you haven't noticed. It's called denial. You start in absolute denial and at some point your deepest mind brings up what's happened.

The more time you spend in denial

Your routine will die. Your grades will drop. You will seclude to mope. Don't. Get out there. The mind heals faster when it's feeling happy. Go out with your friends

Excercise is awesome. It occupies your mind and makes you prettier so you can boost your probably shattered self esteem.

Dating is also very important. You will only completely forget about him/her when you start considering other people. True fact.

**IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU KILL ATTACHMENT**

Why? You may think this is absurd

Bull. Attachment is the root of your problem. In fact

Attachment was generated because duh

The mind does NOT like to change

Try meditating (link to r/meditation below)

Spending time with your ex only opens a wound that needs healing. If you two are not getting back together (you know deep in your heart if this has a chance of happening, maintain ZERO contact. Not even a ""hi"". Nothing. 

Time helps a lot. Time with as little contact as you can helps a great deal more. If you are confronted by your ex, that your grandma has baked you a pie, etc. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOUR EX.

If he/she tries to talk, say as little as you can. If you absolutely NEED to say hi back for social reasons, then just that will do. No conversation.


**Get over it**


If you are at those first few months where your mind is still hard wired to your ex, but drown them if they get out of control. They should not stick around to the fourth month. Never.

Here's a protip: think about the shitty things. Think about the fights, think about why you dumped that sorry ass. If you are the dumpee, then that undeserving shit has dumped you! He doesn't deserve to be in the same room as you, let alone dedicating him/her your thoughts.

If your ex dumped you and was an extremely good and flawless person, think about them. Try and change if you need to. NOT FOR YOUR EX. NOT TO GET BACK. For you. So that this never happens to you again.

 If no reason was stated at all

In every case

The funk is only gonna stay around if you let it. So when you start feeling a little better

**STAGES: What happens next?**

Getting over is a process that goes in many stages. Stages have particular symptoms. They fade over into the next stage, or skip some and save them for later. People are really different. Some may spend a year in denial and then quickly grieve the rest. Some never make it out of depression. Some special cases just need some months. Every stage also contains slivers of others but tends to retract onto itself. Every one ends in Acceptance over something, but not a permanent one.

1: Denial. 

Duration: Breakup event - some weeks after

Symptoms: A feeling that nothing has happened. That you can carry on. That you will get better in no time. An urgent need to go do stupid or weird things that never before had you had the urge to do but are suddenly very important. A constant need of something to do. Anger when being confronted about possible grief.

Overcoming: Accepting that you are now single and that many awful things are about to happen and that you are very very sad

Denial is dangerous. The more you maintain it

2: Early depression with post breakup delusions.

Duration: since the Break of denial (""fuck

Symptoms: You will cry a lot. You will feel absolutely miserable about things. Fantasize about what could have been different. What you could have been different. Feel remorse and anger about mistakes and backstabs. A need to keep tabs on your ex. A constant fantasy of getting back together. You will seek unreal ways of achieving this. Pay no mind. If the fantasies start making you take actions you might regret

Overcoming: Find time to cry a lot. Listen to yourself and try not to be eaten alive by your own thoughts. Accept that you need to grieve. Think abour retracting into yourself and emerging reborn and a better person. Improve your inner life. Talk to those who will listen. You would do the same for them. 

3 and 4: Depression and Anger.

These two come together and jump from one to the other.
 
Duration: Indefinite. The individual durations are short bursts. The period where you're afflicted lasts as long as you let it. More than a month or even two. But finding a way to stop requires a strong will.

Symptoms: 

Depression: Lack of will and motivation. The feeling of not being completely yourself

Anger: Strong bursts of undying and powerful wrath emerging from the memories of your relationship and issues. Wanting to hit things and break them. Wanting to hit people and break them. The need to scream loudly. Lashing out agressively to nonprovocative comments. Lashing out even worse to provocative ones. A deep seated desire for revenge.

Overcoming:

This is the toughest part. Here's the thing: Being in a relationship takes energy. Mental energy. Your mind invests it's energy on the bond created with your now ex couple. That bond is not simply broken

In this stage

The choice usually takes the span of a week. Results are not immediate and relapse is almost inevitable.

Try to clear your mind and make yourself focus on things that are important. Calm yourelf if raging. Focus if idle.

Accept.


5: Acceptance

Acceptance is when one day you realize you haven't thought about your ex in what... Weeks? Months? And then you don't even give half a shit because he/she was not that important and go play some xbox or some shit. Maybe even go date someone better.

Seriously, but surprisingly you will understand them peacefully. At this point you've started reaching acceptance. You may realize that your ex was an utter tool. That he/she cheated on you (happened to me) while never giving away anything while in the relationship and maintaining it a secret. That YOU were a complete and utter tool, etc.

At this point the bursts of anger and sadness start calming down and the mental energy is starting to rewire properly. Acceptance does not come from one day to the other


**Don't keep tabs on your ex**

Ok, and spend less time on social networks so as to not know anything through mutual friends. Stop talking to those much. I don't even care if they are very good friends, or if they now conveniently seem like very nice people to talk to. 

You will only fixate your ex more on your mind, the human being, s/he'd have flaws and things that would make you think and judge straight. An idea is flawless and unreachable and can fuck your shit up a lot more. 

ZERO CONTACT.


**There WILL be an attempt to get back at you. Keep your head up**

Especially if you dumped him/her. But even so, there WILL be an encounter soon where your ex will flaunt how his/her perfect life is. Maybe even her new date. BULLSHIT! Unless months (more than five) have passed, NOBODY gets better like that because of the aforementioned reasons on how the mind attaches and has a hard time unattaching. Not even your ex. S/he's using the separation and your not knowing anything about his/her life as a weapon to hurt you.

The best horror stories are those where the monster or nightmare is not fully described

A real childish thing. And you, badass man/woman and are as worthy of feeling good as any other. So get your head up and don't feel threatened or bullied. So try to avoid your ex and cut conversations short. 

If your ex is being a REAL dick. If he/she's treating you like garbage and taking advantage of your weakness or social spaces and conventions to screw with you and this happens daily or many times a week (if your're study or work partners) then set him/her aside and in all seriousness tell him/her to stop the childish games. No emotion. Just a stern look. 

DO NOT PROMPT A DISCUSSION. If your ex refuges into a discussion


**Want revenge? Here's your fix**

Revenge is a mistake. It NEVER brings about good things. Damaging someone directly only causes more pain and can initiate a cycle of revenge.

I know your feelings. I've felt them too. You feel you need to get back

I do believe that justice is a different matter, he or she will also feel like shit for having done that.

Do this.

Take a month or two to yourself. Learn something cool. Do cool things. You will start feeling better and less inclined toward hurting him/her. You will start being a bigger person. Learn music, or get in a band or a team or a choir or anything. Then do great things with them. Find cute girls or nice guys or whatever and date the fuck out of them (you probably feel like shit and think nobody will date you. It's bullshit, so go date). Go out with friends and do epic things.

Then, better (harder and faster also maybe) you. An improved you. A person much more awesome than who s/he used to date. Bonus points if you are with your new date when this happens (Don't be a dick and prompt this situation though, that is awful). Then s/he will want to go jump off a cliff for letting you go, or for having wronged you or hurt you. It is the world's order making things right. 

Seriously

When you get your chance (and you WILL get it) don't talk too much. Just say hi. Leave. If asked


**Your ex was not that special**

Seriously. I don't care if it was an eight year relationship. It hurts like hell

There are millions of people out there. Go find someone better. Someone different. Your ex only seems special because you got to know him/her a lot. Many people are that deep and special and have those cute gestures that were so cute. Go find out why.


**NO CONTACT**

Seriously. Contact with an ex will bring only suffering. It will hold back healing and give false hope that will absolutely obliterate you when you see her/him with someone else. Healing hurts

Don't ever

If you HAVE to, or your friends are the same, then avoid talk and encounters. Ignore any attempts for attention your ex makes and don't make any yourself.

**Calm your mind**

You may find that your mind and thoughts are killing you. Pay no mind to the stupid attempts they suggest to get back. I mean it. 

Spend energy in doing things. Sports, friends. Philosophy is great. Straighten out your ideals and consolidate your ideology in this time of self-reflection.

Meditation also helps. Not mantra or religious meditation (unless you're already religious in which case go ahead). Meditation is simply an excercise of the mind to which no religious or spiritual connotations should be added. It works wonders for stilling the mind.

This is life. It's *your* life, then you better take it because eventually you are going to run out of moments.  We all become food for worms, and the sooner you embrace that the better. 

This relationship wasn't the very best relationship you can have

Right now you are afraid because you lost something, or at the very least - die. The truth is that you can get anything you want if you are willing to work for it and understand that you will lose it. Once you understand that, then you have to make the choice to go after what you want, or to sit around and think about what you had until you lose more and more as you focus on one depression after the next. You understand now that to have the life you want, you have to fight for it, otherwise you will be let down over and over.

My story: I recently broke up with a girl I had been seeing for over a year

**The breakup talk**. Although you've all been through this when you are dumped its important to get as much information as possible for self growth without sounding like a psycho. Its fine to say you disagree, get your limited closure and get away from the situation. A little bit of emotion shows you're not a sociopath, too much makes you look pathetic. 

- *The garbage* - Keep in mind what they tell you during the breakup is very rarely true. People don't often give truthful answers as to why the split is occurring, if they've told you it may work out down the track but just not now or anything else that will keep you on the string for your own good ignore it. All that matters is they don't want to be with you anymore, they may regret this, they may not, but it doesn't matter. 

**No Contact.** This is preached by everyone and there is a reason for it. Everyone wants to contact their ex. They will justify it as 'trying to say that one last thing', just no. Everything you write is taking away your power and giving it to them. You know what happens when you go no contact? You reclaim your mystery, you reclaim your dignity (something you may have lost in the relationship) you also reclaim your self determination, you are in control again. If you continue to message your ex you are giving them so much power, the power to upset you when they see someone new, the power to put you down if they feel you are being too clingy, but most of all you're sending a message that you are not ok without them. Humans find that final message repulsive

The real reason for no contact is simply that there is nothing you can say to make the situation better. If you call them expecting to speak to the person you once knew you will quickly find they are no longer there, really think about it, do you want to go back on all the good work you've done so far?

- *We can be friends* - Yes. But not until the relationship is truly behind you. For a decent long term relationship this can take a year if not more. If you still have a strong desire to be their friend chances are you are not over them.

**No stalking** This is probably the most important step of all. The modern world has introduced a plateau of modern methods for stalking every movement of your ex. The first thing you need to do is block them on Facebook, Reddit, Wuphf and anything else you use. Block their friends, block anyone else that might show their stuff in your feed. Make sure they can't get into your life. You need to do this instantly so that your body can begin to get used to them not being around. It can be difficult to begin with but only after you've done it can you see just how uplifting it is. You feel feel instant better, again its a control thing, you are incharge of your own healing here and nothing they can do can stop that.

- *Why?* If into your ex's Facebook you go, suspicions are different from actual knowledge. You don't want to go through that.

**Life won't be the same** Now that you've got the basics down, what now people say? Many internet guides will tell you that you need to fill your lives with exciting adventurous activities. But in my experience that just makes you miss your past life. The best thing ive always found is to become comfortable with the fact your life is now different, you have that time, you have those memories but now it was time for it to end. Your new life may be objectively worse in your eyes and i'm not going to promise you it will lead to better things but sometimes the path we are on is worse and doesn't lead to better things (although it usually does...) and you have to accept that. Over times your past life will be simply a memory and your new life will grow but don't rush it. I've heard the ""Its 1 month I should have moved on by now"" line so many times, it will happen when it happens. If you feel lonely be comfortable with the lonelyness, if you feel bored be comfortable with the boredom. Try and be comfortable with the change and your healing will progress faster than someone who tries to block it out.

**Let go of the anger**. After a breakup chances are you have a lot of residual anger. Unfortunately for all of loves highs it tends to have pretty deep lows. But for all of the terrible things your ex may have done to you being mad at them will not help, like you, you both made mistakes, chances are you both knew it was over. So don't hate them as it really is a zero sum emotion that will get you no where.

**Don't date until the time is right** This applies to both dumpers and dumpees. If you get out of a relationship chances are you are not ready to date yet. You are just using it to cover up the emotions and your new partner will notice. Ive rebounded before and carried in huge amounts of baggage. It makes you look bad. Only when you've come to terms with the breakup and waited however long it takes for the right partner to come into your life is it time to move on. If you go on the 'hunt' chances are you will only hurt yourself and probably someone else too.

**In your moment of weakness*** don't stalk, but it is a temptation born from reliance and a lack of independence. You will move past this. Remember, everytime you don't contact them you get stronger. You're kind of like a Pokemon in that regard, get strong enough and you will evolve! 

**You will be ok**. Ive had a few types of breakups, i'm not going to leave by saying you will get another shot wiith your ex because you probably won't, but you will be once again fine in your own skin and that is the most important thing.

God bless.

1338987139.0,unv06,Saw my first serious girlfriend in a restaurant yesterday after 8 years post-breakup. Perspective and a lesson learned.,my_bu_throwaway33,137,11,25,"I'm a 28/m married to a wonderful woman. We have a 2 year old and another due in January. I'm one happy dude.

My distantly ex girlfriend was my first love. We were inseparable in high school and the beginning of college. We had a horrible falling out when I decided to study abroad for a semester and she dumped me. I was devastated and took it poorly. When I got back stateside I vowed not to ever speak to her again.

8 years later: my best friend from high school, maybe less. 

She is with her best friend from high school and her daughter who is a bit older than my son. For the first time in 8 years we speak.

Me: How are you?

Her: Good! This is __________. Say hi

Her daughter greets me. Pigtails and pink shorts. She strongly resembles an old picture of her mother I used to pass in the hallway of her childhood home.

I implore my son to be sociable but he is focused on his spaghetti. We all laugh and banter about kids, pick up a fork, and soon I'm engaged and laughing with the most important person in my world besides my wife. My friend and I talk work and houses.

Later I started thinking. No contact for 8 years and we meet under precisely similar circumstances. And it wasn't awkward or weird. Just two grownups talking about their kids. In that moment

There is a concept in the world of education (my field) that states novelty of experience imbues greater learning. Your first love is like that. It's so new and exciting that you remember everything about it. And when it ends it hurts so badly you can't imagine feeling good ever again. Being a teenager/early 20something means experiencing a wealth of newness that can be difficult to synthesize; heartbreak is even more difficult. For me

Did our encounter dredge up some old feelings? Sure. But it also showed me that truly ""moving on"" means living as well as you can FOR YOURSELF. When people on this subreddit say ""no contact, travel, do something other than dwell. It helps in the short term. Long term, it allows you to gain perspective on a life altering event and gain a better understanding of who you are and what you need in a partner.

IT WILL GET BETTER. Really. But you have to live your own life first. 

And here's the weird part: Seeing my ex at such a similar and happy stage in life made me feel good. She wasn't a bad person. She deserves a good life. Then again

So please

1313207888.0,jhfh2,For those of you who are in pain;,,136,12,37,"Before I begin

I have some advice for you that I hope will help. Whether you are fresh out of a relationship or still trying to get over one much later, each breakup is different but this is advice that should work for *most* breakups. Without further ado..

**Cut off all contact immediately**

This is the single most important piece of the healing process. If you continue to discuss your relationship with your ex, I blocked her on Facebook and blocked her phone number. Any contact you have with your ex will send you back to square zero in the healing process.

**Yes

This may be the most obnoxious thing to hear but it is very true. Whether or not you can see it, ""Having is not so pleasing as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true."" This leads me into my next point.

**Get a notebook and write**

Write down everything on your mind. You *will* start to see patterns. The thing that helped me the most was to make a list of both the good and bad parts of our relationship. After doing so, there were dealbreakers.

**Do not bandage your feelings**

Let yourself feel how you actually feel. If you feel like crying, that only means that your relationship didn't mean anything to you. It did.

**Similarly

If you try to drown your pain in drugs or alcohol

**Stop worrying about what the other person is doing**

Your ex is no longer a part of your life. You have absolutely no control over how they are feeling or what they are doing. All that is left of your ex is the memory you have of them. That doesn't have to be a bad thing. Cherish this. They helped you grow as a person

**Focus on yourself**

While you are in a relationship

**You will love again**

As much as you may *just know* that your ex was ""the one"", or you wouldn't have felt compelled to leave them. Someday, you will meet the person that you will spend the rest of your life with. It seems like a foreign concept now, but just wait. You will love again, just as someone will love you again.

**Your situation is unique!**

Do not expect to find the ""answer"" from anyone. This doesn't mean that people will not be able to make you see things in a different, then you are well on your way to healing. You are strong and you are a great person!

**Do me a favor and smile :)**

I really hope that you will find some sort of peace or understanding from this post. If anything

1358820736.0,1711xa,Things I've learned after some time passed - The 7 Things to Remember Post-Breakup,ShapedCharge,123,16,41,"Dear r/BreakUps

I came to you all a couple months ago when things were at their worst. I posted a few things, by far, the most supportive subreddit that I have had the pleasure of being a part of and the experience was one I appreciated immensely. The account that I used to post my story and my content has now been closed (and this new one activated) to escape any contact with my ex and/or her new boyfriend (yes, who messaged me), but I wanted to take the time to come here and share a few of the things I feel I've learned over the past few months.

1. **Things do get better.** I can't stress this enough. In the immediate period following the breakup, but things, over time, got way, way better. I've met some great girls and gone out many times in the last couple of months, and finding yourself again is a great feeling. I promise you all, things will get better
2. **You cannot define yourself by your relationship.** If you have ever said ""I don't know who I am without this person, plans, ideas, a sense of humour, etc. But at the end of the day, that's still a construct of a shared experience. YOU, at your core, your own ideas
3. **You are worthy of love.** This one was a hard one for me. I felt as though losing this girl meant that I was meant to be alone. How could someone I loved so dearly and who I did so much for leave like that? It didn't make any sense. What was wrong with me? I'm here to tell you: *Nothing is wrong with you.* You are worthy of love
4. **You can't sit at home and wallow in your pain.** This might be a tough one for some of you. Some days I didn't want to go anywhere. I wanted to sleep it all away. This is a sign of depression, to spend time with family and friends... it's good advice! Listen to it! I found the gym to be my favourite place to blow off steam, and dammit I'm making great progress! I'm at a lower body weight than I've been in literally 5 years and I'm starting to see results in my muscle tone. Hit the gym! Read a book! Do something active which engages your mind and body in a productive way. And get the hell out of your house!
5. **Don't be afraid of new experiences and new people.** This was the best part of moving on... meeting so many great new girls and having a blast doing it. Believe me, maybe go to a social gathering with some people you are acquaintances with. Visit a convention. Just do whatever you can to be open to meeting new people. At the very least, you expand your network. At the best, you meet that next special person! I met a great girl who I had a fun little fling with just by going out one night to a party with a friend. You never know what's around the corner if you just say ""Fuck it!"" and go.
6. **Don't rush into a new relationship.** Now, because you're not really ready, are you? Are you trying to get back into a relationship because you miss the familiarity? The comfort? The feel of a warm body next to yours in the mornings? Yeah, I know those feelings. You want to be with someone to fill those gaps but hey... wait a while. Don't rush into something with someone you barely know just because you're lonely... you're not doing them any favours and you're not doing yourself justice either. Take some time to heal.
7. **Take it one day at a time.** Things might seem insurmountable now, friends. This too shall pass. You can handle the burden, just focus on ""today"" and don't worry too much about tomorrow. Eventually, one day will turn into the next, which will turn into the next... and eventually, it will all pass. Before you know it, you'll be healed and back to normal! And life will be a-ok :)

I wish each of you nothing but the best in your healing process and I love you all. Remember

1345796803.0,yqu0k,What I learned from my heartbreak,,126,25,35,"I got dumped a few months back by the first girl I ever loved. It was by far the most painful and draining experience I've had in my life. It was so sudden, but I would still send her a text every few days or call her. She never answered. I didn't know what happened at first and I was furious and demanded answers

- Don't call them. Ever. Yes the most typical piece of advice you can get on this site or others is not to contact them at all, every call you don't get a response for, every emotional letter you send to them hurts you and pushes them farther away and you dig yourself a nice little hole like I did. Trust me, I know it may seem impossible, but you just can't talk to them. If they aren't responding, they don't want to talk to you, and it doesn't matter if it seems like the best thing you've ever written, it isn't going to work. Leave them alone, so I'm trying to tell all of you not to be like me. Let sleeping dogs lie. 

- They are probably going to see other people, that rush of adrenaline that makes you shake in fear, or it can make you ill. Although it sucks, it's inevitable. They aren't yours anymore, just like you aren't theirs. Don't decline to go out with your friends just so you can sit around scouring the internet for ways to get them back. Nothing but staying busy, working on yourself, or going out to hopefully meet someone else is ever going to help you. They might be seeing other people, and if you happen to see your ex with someone else

- Look inside yourself. How did you contribute to this breakup? At first I was gung-ho with she's a bitch who doesn't know what she's talking about, really reflect on things they might have told you that were bothering them, no matter how minor. You'll find your answer and closure there if they didn't give you any. Although you may have done things to drive them away, it still isn't all your fault. I might have done some things that weren't cool, but so did my ex. There is contribution by both of you to the demise of your relationship. Learn from it and make sure that for the next person you avoid any tendencies you identified as a problem with your ex.

- Stay busy. Pretty self explanatory. Don't be like me and sit in your room all day, you aren't going to find it. If your friends invite you to hang out, go be with them. If your friends aren't around, hit the gym or go running. Don't go anywhere near where you know your ex might be if you are out. Coffee places, restaurants, any places you know they frequent, steer fucking clear.

- They aren't coming back. Yes my friends, there is never going to be one. When my ex dumped me I was absolutely certain that she was going to call, no doubt. I figured that she HAD to have realized she had messed up, and in just a few short weeks she was going to call me crying, begging for me to take her back. Well that shit never happened, and I doubt that it will. Yea there are some stories around that pump you up, give you a little hope. Stories like my ex called me 2 weeks later, 3 months later, I truly began to get over her. I got serious about being in shape, shake your ex off of their pedestal and put yourself back on it. You are number fucking one

This definitely isn't the best writing I've ever done

Edit 1: Here are some more things that I thought of

- There isn't going to be one fantastic day where your heart is healed and you can move on. You can't flip your love on and off like a switch. Your pain and your love for them slowly fade away. Don't hide from your feelings though, it's not good for you. Don't bottle them up either, it might work in the short term but it is just a ticking time bomb waiting to explode on you. It is a slow and painful process, but you have to want to do it. If you are still clinging on to any hopes of being anything, together or friends, let them go. You aren't going to move on an inch if you are still harboring fantasies of them running back to you. Life isn't a movie, and I'm 99% sure it isn't going to happen.

- A popular question and one that I have asked as well is, or so I thought. She surprised me with the break-up, ignored me completely afterwards, and it seemed like she didn't care at all. I sent her some nasty texts one day and I felt good about it, felt like she deserved it. Found out later I made her cry. I felt terrible, and learned that even though she seemed like such an ice-queen, she was probably still too torn up about the breakup to respond without emotions attached. Don't assume things about your ex. Honestly, but that doesn't mean that they want to be in a relationship with you. She was able to do what I couldn't and initiate NC. It was better for both of us that way,,

First, and some unintentionally (because I haven’t read all the threads in this subreddit). I’m not taking credit for all the things I say here, but I hope you can appreciate the content within.

Secondly, fell in love with this bitch and this bitch fell in love with me very hard, very fast. Went through a lot (mostly parents) for each other. Both thought we could easily end up together. Intense, passionate, mutual feelings actually did last for most of the relationship. Lots of beautiful memories with bitch, especially at wonderful times like Christmas and New Year’s and birthdays. During last month, bitch changed and become very distant, hurtful things said from both people

I’ve broken the guide into sections so it’ll be easier to find what you’re looking for.

Here we go. 

**The Breakup**

You two break up. The reasons remain irrelevant in most circumstances. Usually, boredom, excess conflict, and a lot of bullshiting. But anyway, the break up happens. Most of you reading this will be the people who got broken up with. It feels fucking awful, doesn’t it? You were probably thinking of moving in with that person eventually, maybe getting married, often without any hint of remorse. For many of us, I lost all my best friends in the process. Thanks for twisting the knife.

**The Immediate Aftermath**

Following the first few days of the break up, but it is. When I broke up with my ex, I calmly got out of bed (yeah..*good fucking morning* to you, too), and took a shower and went along with my day. It wasn't until two days after when I really broke down and realized how much my life had changed in that one phone call. So it’s completely normal to feel strangely normal at first, and then completely break down. But more on that later. 

**You’re not alone**

This is the first and most important thing you need to realize. *Yes*, the same level of love, commitment, affection, passion, admiration when we were with our respective exes. We *all* felt the same level of despair and desolation upon the end of the relationship; some of us are better able to control that chaos within our minds than others. If you feel that your pain is worse than someone else’s, you’re wrong. Obviously, people will feel different levels of hurt

**You’re still moping? How pathetic are you?**

*Just kidding*. Most of us will remain depressed for quite a bit, they’ll tell you how much I’ve bitched about that bitch. Whether it was ten months or ten years, the person became a bigger focus of attention than any of our other friends did. We did things for him/her that we never do for our friends. We felt a spectrum of emotions that seemed to belong exclusively to your ex. It’s natural to feel sadness that will never seem to leave since you’re suddenly left with such a massive void. Do you ever feel like you won’t love again? Do you not want to love again? Are you shaken that you haven’t collapsed from all this pain, fear, and anxiety? *Good*. 

I’m glad you’re hurting. Why?

I’m not an ass for saying that (Fine, I’m glad you’re hurting because it means that the relationship meant something to you. I’m not talking strictly in the emotional sense. The brain craves anything that gives it pleasure. Trust me guys; I’m a [future] doctor [probably]. Clearly, being with your SO gave you loads of pleasure on a physical and emotional level. We hurt because we miss what made us unbelievably happy, and what gave us that euphoric high. When all of that disappears instantly, your brain isn’t willing to let it all go without a fight. It thrashes and it struggles. But what is really important to realize here is that you *can* gain solace from the *pain*. You need to realize that the emotional turmoil you experience is a good thing, because it means that those x number of weeks/months/years all meant something to you. If your ex walked away from it all without showing any emotion (usually this is just a veil, no one’s a cold-hearted cunt like that), aren’t you the winner here? Sure

**Frequent this subreddit

It’s definitely good to read the top posts to gain perspective of how to approach situations like this, perhaps professional help is better suited.

**Help out on this subreddit**

I know we’re all focused on our own problems, but it’s to help you gain some perspective through your own writing. When we write things, our thoughts can’t immediately counter them, since they’re on paper. We’re forced to see what we’ve written in a much more concrete manner, and that has actually led to some really big revelations for me. 

**Coping with the Shitstorm**

*Step 1: Finding a support system*

For many of us, since you’d have to tell a stranger *all* the details of your story, it draws away the influence of any assumptions that your mutual friends might make. My support system consisted of friends from high school that I was close with, some people that became very close to me after the break up, and then some strangers on Reddit who I’m forever indebted towards. If you’re really having trouble finding someone, message me or something. I promise I’ll reply, even if it takes a while. In the support system, a person who you can always vent to, and they genuinely do care for you and your well being.

_____________________________________________________________________________

Be wholly unprepared. Start in a position of confidence so solid, how much you’ve come to rely on another person for your happiness, until it’s much too late. Only when you begin to feel them slip through your fingers do you start to think about how much they have come to mean to you. Realize that it is far too much, all at once.

Notice changes in them that would be imperceptible to someone who didn’t know them as well as you do. Watch the way they seem distracted over dinner, but you never understood how important that was until it stopped happening. Start insisting on eye contact, on more touch, on more engagement.

Notice as they become palpably put-off by your need to be closer, they will be even more threatened by all that your presence implies. Start to understand that being in a relationship means a constant form of contact with someone — a constant importance placed on their existence and their happiness — and that your partner is no longer comfortable with that. Feel the way they want to get rid of you; cling tighter.

Know the day where the speech is coming. Feel it in your bones when they call you and ask you to meet them somewhere — somewhere public enough that you won’t make a scene. Want with every fiber of your being not to go to this place because it feels so much like walking to your own death, and imagine that one of them would have been the magic formula to make them still be in love with you. Hate yourself in a way you’ve never before experienced.

Hear them say the words, change — but you have gone temporarily deaf. Try not to cry, but feel your throat catch every time you open your mouth to talk. Want to remain stoic about the whole thing, but reduce yourself to begging with only the tiniest bit of resistance. Offer things, left and right, as though you could somehow barter your way into someone’s heart again. Be ready to become anything they want, to lie about who you are and what you want

Want to physically hold onto their leg as they walk out the door, no one could really understand, that you are entirely alone in a way you’ve never really experienced before. Want to just cry, cry until you finally fall asleep.

Hear people all around you tell you that things are going to get better, even if they think they’re being kind. Know that the only person who could ever possibly make you feel better has no interest in talking to you, and wonder how in the world you are supposed to continue getting out of bed when such is the case. Let your friends’ words of inspiration wash over you, and occasionally glance at your phone, waiting for the right person to call. They don’t.",,False,t5_2ra79,True

Maybe you cheated, and cannot fathom a life without them. Maybe you saw them on the bus once, and got a little obssessed. Maybe they're a friend of a friend who you had great chemistry with, but unreconcilable lifestyles.
It could be anything. It could be nothing. There could be no good reason for someone to leave

Life. There are many tears, and thank god that they were born a functioning human being, and not one of the amoebas living in the neck crust of Honey Boo Boo Child's mother, Mama June. Hail Mary.

Back to the shit-ass-ness...nothing is quite like losing a relationship. It happens all the time. No pain is quite like it. There isn't much point in trying to classify what has happened to you, and upward. Limbo is not allowed, lest your mind sink into the maddness of wondering ""what if"" and ""if only"" and ""I should have"". 

Maybe things could have been different. But they aren't. They aren't and they won't ever be, because they will be hovering over you for the rest of your life. Makes friends with this version of you. Don't wonder if true love exists, because it does. Take comfort in this.

Let your past make you better, because you are. You're fine. You'll be just fine. And that's enough for now.

1354673447.0,14aqrj,My tips for dealing with your breakup - hope this helps!,dyzfunctioned,100,13,44,"Hey /r/breakups

You guys have been there for me so I'm trying to give back however I can. Right now I feel good, and again in the morning, but what matters right now is that at this moment, I am okay. 

I think these things can help all of us regardless of what stage we're in, or you can pm me.

Without further ado...

***1) Work Out*** - Yes, but for 15, 30, 45, whatever amount of minutes that you're working out nothing else matters - that's huge. Plus there's all that scientific hormone stuff too (endorphins = good). Don't make excuses - I come home after work and my workout clothes are waiting at the door. I change on the spot. I never shower in the mornings because if I do I know I'll be tempted to skip the workout because I'll have to shower again. Just make it happen. Start small if you need to, it can be as little as a 15 minute walk - just make sure you do something and do it regularly, and go from there.

***2) Deal with the Nights*** - Nights suck as we all know. Here's something not everyone will tell you... don't sleep in your bed. Seriously. I've been sleeping at friends, whatever. The couch isn't always the comfiest but I don't know about the rest of you it's not like I'm sleeping well anyway. Engage in a passive distraction when going to bed - I listen to music and just focus on the lyrics. It helps keep my mind somewhat focused without being so worked up that I can't sleep. If you're the person that likes white noise, give that a try. If all else fails, watch TV until your eyes close on their own.

***3) Make Daily Goals*** - Nothing too ambitious (though you can!) if you don't want. My list today was morning warmup, start a new book, watch walking dead, read about meditation. It doesn't matter if you don't do them all - buying an ice scraper has been on my list for a week now - just make sure you do at least a few and bump the rest to tomorrow. It'll make you feel like you at least accomplished something.

***4) Have a Morning Routine*** - Mornings are brutal, jumping jacks, whatever. Do them for a minute or two, that's all you need to clear your mind and get the uices flowing. Check it off your list.

***5) Positive Thinking*** - It's not easy at times like this but there's ways you can make yourself do it without even realizing it. Sitting there bored and sad and about to type ""how to get your ex back"" into google (don't worry, and in a positive light nonetheless.

***6) Open Up*** - As a guy, so fuck that stereotype. Break free of it. I've opened up to friends and family for the first time and have become more trusting of people in general, despite the fact things my ex did left me with trust issues. Now I'm not saying walk up to a stranger and lay your heart on the line, but if you have some people you trust, use them. If not, come here, or better yet, right now - if you don't have someone you feel you can trust and you're not comfortable posting your issues out in public for the world to see

***7) Try Something New*** - Anything! I've got a bunch of stuff I'm trying but for example, gives you someone to talk to, you make a new friend, and the best part of all about doing something new - it's pretty tough to relate to your ex. This is something for you and about you. Enjoy it. If you feel up to it, do something a little out of your comfort zone!

***8) Stay off Facebook*** - Now, or whatever. Maybe I'm alone in this, but if you go on Facebook you see updates of people's lives. Going through a breakup and all, it's a safe bet you probably thought about your ex more than once today and seeing all these other life updates will make you wonder what's going on in your ex's life. Even if you resist temptation to look at his/her page, it doesn't matter - they're already on your mind. Just don't do it. If you need to go on quick to see a message or something, do it from your phone. It's less functional and you can just close right out of it after you're done.

***9) Create a New Attachment Figure*** - I don't know how I forgot about this one in the original post as I think it's pretty huge. When you're in a relationship, the one you say goodnight to every night and the one you think will always be there for you. So when that person suddenly disappears from your life, regardless of whether it was your choice or not, there's one massive gaping hole. Nothing is going to replace this person, not yet anyway. However, there is something you can do and it's pretty simple, you can even use draw names out of a hat or something. Just pick someone you can talk to on a frequent basis that won't mind and make them your new attachment figure; it can be a friend, penpal, e-mail them, the first person that comes to mind may not be your ex. Give it a try

That's it for now folks. Hang in there

This also rules out people who have just separated, and the moment that you involve yourself in any of the above situations, the person knows that they don’t really have to do anything. If they lie to you and let you think they’re single, abort mission.

I should also remind about ‘lender awareness’ – do not allow yourself to be in a situation where you are sharing your man

2. I will not spend my time waiting around, waiting for them to come back, waiting for them to turn into The Man I Think He Could/Should Be, or waiting for them to decide if they want to be with me – I’m not putting my life on hold for anyone.

When a man is interested, the sooner they learn to treat the women they date with more respect.

This also means you will avoid being in barely there

When someone’s interested in you and wants a relationship

And never, ever, ever, wait around for someone to decide whether they want a relationship with you. Don’t demean yourself!

3. I will not continue engaging in any relationship where either they or I don’t treat me with love, and respect.

Start as you mean to go on. Even though love is not there from the outset, and respect. It’s called integrity and decency. By the same token, if loving them means you can’t love you, always choose you. Do not erode your self-esteem by disrespecting yourself in a relationship. If you don’t treat you decently, others won’t. This is a fundamental part of having boundaries. If you can’t date with self-esteem, don’t date until you can.

4. I will not continue dating someone who reveals themselves to be a Future Faker or a Future Avoider.

Whether they tell lies about the future to get what they want in the present or they just refuse to talk about the future

Some people just can’t help but talk themselves up a storm at the beginning. They believe their own hype and overestimate their interest and end up making promises they can’t and won’t deliver on. Watch how quickly their personality switches or they disappear when they’re expected to deliver. Don’t waste your life waiting for them to become the Person They Were In The Beginning.

If someone is reluctant to talk about the future

5. I will not date someone who controls the relationship on their terms – I must be in mutually fulfilling

Plain and simple

6. I will not allow someone to use me for sex

It’s your prerogative to have casual sex but you should only be doing so if it’s what you actually want and are not building up feelings. You cannot work your way up from booty call to girlfriend. Likewise

7. I will drop guys who manage the bulk of the communication in our relationship by text, like a hot potato.

There is no excuse for this lazy communication and it’s the hallmark of emotionally unavailable people who want to keep themselves distant. It’s not modern relationships and dating – it’s modern booty calls and half hearted interest. It says

8. I will not allow lies to foster my interactions, or getting the truth distorted.

Feet in reality, or repeatedly lie to you and get caught out. If you accept it, they’ll think they have license to keep lying to you. People who have integrity and respect you don’t lie to you.

9. I will not pursue someone who has either directly or passively rejected me.

Trust me, you wouldn’t still be chasing them!

This means no pursuing them after they have turned you down, not bothered to call you, pit you against other women and certainly no chasing someone to convince them that they should be interested in you. You have more self respect than this and you don’t need to be the equivalent of a used car salesman forcing yourself on someone.

10. I will not play Florence Nightingale because it is not my job to fix/heal/help the Walking Wounded

Everyone has issues but there’s baggage and there’s baggage. Let them sort out their own problems and don’t hide behind theirs. Always acknowledge the red flag that is a dependency on something or emotional/behavioural issues that prevent a healthy relationship. If you ignore

11. I will not date an assclown – someone who is unkind/cruel, abuses me.

When someone treats you poorly

12. I will not make up excuses for other people’s behaviour or make exceptions to my boundaries. My boundaries are non-negotiable!

Do not treat your partners like children even if they act like it. Don’t make it up as you go along either and come up with your own reasons for why you think they behave as they do. That’s projection. Respect your own boundaries

1335387559.0,ssdtr,NO CONTACT: Why you shouldn't be friends/in contact with your ex - Dramallama,thehardestthing,96,16,37,"I am an absolute advocate of No Contact. Whether you're initially doing it to make your ex miss you, you may get your ex back

Posting Dramallama's awesome thread on here for redditors to refer to when they're not sure to go No Contact after a break up or are seriously thinking of breaking No Contact. It's helped me

**Reasons why you shouldn't be friends/in contact with your ex or unrequited love.**

1) It's another way to avoid dealing with the pain of a break-up or loss but you will have to deal with it sooner or later

2) It shows your ex that you don't have the confidence to walk away from someone that has ALREADY told you that they don't see a future with you

3) It relieves your ex of their guilt

4) It shows your ex that you are willing to settle for less than what you want. You lose your self-respect; they lose respect for you

5) It shows your ex that you are not strong or confident enough to stand on your own two feet

6) It will keep the pain fresh and give you false hope

7) Instead of living your life and healing

8) You will have to see how much fun they are having when they are free and single without you tying them down

9) You will have to repress your true feelings because you are the one that accepted this arrangement

10) Your ex can sleep with you/lead you on/tease you/hang out together, we're just friends, remember? You agreed to that and I don't want to be tied down right now."" Ouch.

11) It will stop YOU from meeting and seeing (with your heart) people that WILL want to be with you. from meeting someone that will not be happy with just being friends. Someone that is so crazy about YOU

12) You will probably see or hear about your ex flirting with someone else

13) It keeps you in a perpetual state of limbo where you are uncertain about what your future holds (in a bad way)

14) It does nothing to help your self esteem and dignity (which is low after a break up anyway) because you are asking yourself

15) It doesn't give you time to get perspective or clarity or to learn anything from the relationship. You can only look at something objectively when enough time has passed. You cannot do that if you are in the middle of the hurricane.

16) It lets your ex use YOU as their emotional tampon (where you have to soak up all of their problems), so they don't think you are asking too much of them. In the end it just drives you crazy because you can't act how you want to act. You become frustrated version of yourself which drives you to be even more clingy. 

17) If there's a true basis for friendship, or however long you need to heal and move on. There's no rush.

18) If your ex is already in a relationship/dating and you keep in touch with them it will give them an ego boost and it will make their new relationship MORE successful than if you weren't around. Why? Because you are a good distraction for what might be going wrong in their new relationship. If their new relationship is only half as fulfilling, the ex is fulfilled. But if you go away and make yourself scarce, then your ex must make a choice as to whether his new relationship is fulfilling in all the ways as they would like.

18) It won't give your ex a chance to miss you if you stay in contact, a shirt that you like to wear that is hanging in your wardrobe. You take for granted something when it is available. 

But when you can't have it

I'm not necessarily saying that it will make your ex come back, and for the good feelings to return. Even if your ex is begging you to stay friends, this point STILL applies!

19) They can't miss you if you are hanging around like a bad smell. If you take them at their word and leave and disappear into the fog, but they will ask themselves, ""did I do the right thing?""

The many articles suggest that a dumper mentally prepares themselves for the eventual breakup. All the small things add up

This post really got to me: [A few posts down](http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/coping/177026-dumper-s-vs-dumpee-s-sadness)

&gt; By the time you've been dumped, it appears that the person who last week was saying ""I love you"" went from that to indifference in a mind boggling period of time. 

&gt; I see it on here quite often - people who find themselves dumped seemingly out of the blue by someone

&gt; Trust me, and you want answers. They finished their healing process (or nearly completely so) before you even knew you would need one. 

&gt; So, months, years go by more and more of the fire goes out - slowly. The guilt that you feel when you find yourself falling out of love is crushing. You know you should love this person, but you find yourself not loving them a little more each day. You feel sad that the love you felt is going, and you can't get it back. You are saying goodbye to the relationship and there is this profound sadness that no matter what you do, and no matter what your partner does - you just can't get it back.

&gt; As the sadness is replaced with acceptance, but guilty at the same time. This causes helpless anger to boil up inside them - often taken out on the dumpee in the form of nagging, nitpicking or just plain hostility. Sometimes that part is hidden completely though, and the dumper will continue to say ""I love you"" even when he/she doesn't feel it because it is expected, and they know it is what the dumpee wants to hear. 

&gt; Then, or is interested in something new in general and is looking for a humane way to let go. If they still have unresolved feelings or the new thing doesn't work out, they will come back for a second chance. Usually though, it is just a long goodbye. 

&gt; Dumpers do feel bad about what is going on. Unfortunately by the time that final goodbye is on the table

&gt; That is why they can say they want to be friends/keep in contact/etc - they are emotionally ready for that,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,t3_1htfcn

•	treat me like crap

•	ignore me

•	cheated on me

•	broke up with me for no reason

•	all the above


**I am convinced that you are**

•	such a catch/brass ring/prize

•	the greatest person in the universe

•	the light of my life

•	a wonderland

•	all the above


**I am sure of this because:**

•	I have no self-esteem

•	I am a raging codependent

•	I like to be mistreated

•	Damn

•	All of the above

**It is impossible for me to keep from contacting you. Therefore

•	plead with you

•	yell at you in the hopes you turn into what I *want* to think you are

•	lecture at you to show you I really mean it

•	show you how much I love you and only you because you are so attractive

•	All of the above. Preferably at the same time.

**To have you and only you

•	a happy life

•	a loving mate

•	a healthy relationship

•	the respect of my friends and family

•	all of the above

**It is my fervent hope that you end:**

•	your silence

•	your confusion

•	your denial that we are meant to be

•	your relationship with someone else

•	all of the above

**But if you don’t

•	you are wonderful and I am pitiful

•	you are really great and not worth giving up even though you don’t give me a single iota of attention

•	moving on is hard work and I’d rather chase after you than save myself and build my own life

•	why not?

•	all of the above

**So I am sending this via:**

•	email

•	mail

•	series of texts

•	Facebook status

•	all of the above

**I hope you never think that:**

•	I have standards or boundaries or self-respect

•	I will ever ask to be treated differently

•	You can’t get away with everything and more

•	You have to show me

**Because:**

•	I don’t

•	I won’t

•	You don’t

1363673276.0,1akux5,The most important thing you will ever do is love yourself.,collegedreads,86,10,12,"I wrote this as a comment in another thread but I felt compelled to post this as an entirely new post because hopefully more people can benefit from it. You deserve to know you're not alone. ~~Because every single thing you said rings true to what I've been feeling.~~ I have a few things to say.

I am going to lead with this:

**The most important thing you will ever do is love yourself.** 
I had this epiphany today and though it is unbelievably hard to face, and realize that we are beautiful, amazing people and we deserve our own love. Our own respect.

* **Don't do the friends thing.** You're doing it because you're still madly in love with them and you stupidly listen to your heart and believe that there is something to salvage. That you miss their company. It will not help. It will make it impossible for you to let them go completely and will give them the satisfaction of getting whatever they need from you while harming you in return. It condones their behavior and 'allows' them to not hurt like you do. Like we do. At the end you say you're sick of feeling used and unwanted. Those feelings are caused by you fueling the fucked-up remnants that still remain. They will get worse with time if you continue having contact with this person. They will never be who you want them to be; the 'them' you remember is unfortunately not going to come back. We can't make them who we want them to be.

* **They are not going to hurt as much as we are.** There's a song I listen to where the main chorus is 'cuz when a heart breaks no it don't break even.' This is the epitome of why we hurt so bad. Because they don't. And it is a sad realization but one I undoubtedly share with you, the emotional weight, our love, behind them. If your relationship is a true mirror of mine, then you may have yet to realize that the reason they don't feel the way we do is because they've been letting us go for some time. They've already grieved, but because we are not what they now want, it isn't as hard for them to move on.

* **You are not alone.** I promise you, our pride, our hearts and our self-esteem. Within the hellish storm that is devastation, amongst the constant bombardment of waves of tears—we must find solace. It's not that we should or that we can, but we must. We must, at our own time and upon our own journey, have the most beautiful epiphany. *We are worth it.* When it was good, mind and soul as a temple. Sure, as much love as allll the pain we've been harboring, that what they did was so unbelievably cruel

* **Stop giving in and feeling like you need to hold onto them.** Not only are you condoning the pain they put you through and are continuing to put you through, happiness. It is a place where that hurt won't find you. They were a stop on your path. But we are travelers and our lives are journeys and home is that person that would never leave us so indignant, so wronged, so unjustly destroyed, on a sinking ship with not even a lifejacket. Home begins with loving yourself, being okay with being your own best friend, and continuing on this journey alone. It may be dark and scary at times

Sucks to think about, despite me going into no contact mode. I have class with her. I see her every week around campus. Still, when I get down on myself, I realize that there's an opportunity to be had here. Changing yourself. Molding yourself into what you want to be. The old me is gone. It's time to reintroduce yourself to yourself. 

(S)he rejected you. Everything about you. For whatever reason. But here's where the good part comes. The old you is gone. It's dead. The life you had or thought you had is now over. And you're left with rebuilding yourself from the ground up. Be the change that you want to be. Sit down. Think about what it is you want for YOURSELF. Gym membership? Better job? New wardrobe? New circle of friends? All of that is within your realm of control. The best piece of advice I've received from my circle of friends during this time is

Tell yourself from now on ""I will commit to myself. I will commit to my well-being."" But more importantly, and you're here to do you. It shows yourself that there is happiness at the end of this long and dark tunnel. You can't sort out someone else without first sorting out yourself.

The biggest tool you have is yourself. Improve. Commit. Succeed.

Picture this. Take your situation with the breakup. And reverse the role. You were the dumper. How much would it suck to see your ex around, get that muscle definition? To have their friends say, ""Wow, (s)he looks good""? How tough would it be to see the new and improved ex? The happy, better looking, rejuvenated ex. I know for sure it would haunt me and I'd lose a good deal of sleep. I'd be kicking myself senseless asking myself, ""Crap, then you'll enter that mindset of being the better and bigger person.

And through that mindset, those feelings for your ex will pass. Slowly but surely, they'll fade. And the end result will be the new and improved you - the victor of that silent battle - looking better, dressing better, feeling better. And you'll then turn your attention to the rest of the world.

1320656939.0,m3crn,For everyone on /r/BreakUps This is FOR YOU!,throw_away_need_help,88,14,51,"To be honest the best thing you can do at this point is just move on. I know it sounds like it's the hardest thing to do. Trust me I know.

From personal experience the best thing you CAN do is to let them go. Why you ask? Because if you can't let them go how are you ever going to self improve on yourself and create a persona of a person that is even greater than it is now? You have to make yourself better before someone else can see it. Give yourself time away from others and be single.

I know it sounds like I'm saying don't chase. It's because I am saying just that. You can't chase after someone that doesn't want to be chased. Force them to see that you're worth being chased after. Don't give into the temptations of seeking after another. Seek the temptation of wanting others to seek you!

I know you feel lost right now but being open minded about everything around you is the best thing you can do. Don't let yourself be filled with this void that feels so empty because they up and left you. I'm not the best at telling advice but I know from personal experience that as of this moment. I dearly want her back too. Only thing is I have to let the bird fly from it's nest before (if or when) she decides to come back. If she doesn't then another bird will surely land in this nest and be like ""hey this looks like a good home I just might stay here"".

I know you may think she is the only one for you at this point but there is no such thing as ""The One"". You have to look at life on the brighter side. See things in the ways which you couldn't whilst in a relationship. Live life positively and GOOD. Never digress into something you aren't.

I thought about suicide too. A few days after we broke up. I decided against it. There's nothing in it that will benefit you, father, brother, sister, friends, cousins, aunts, and etc. Think of how many people it'll hurt before you decide to do something so rash. You're loved by SO many you just have to open your eyes. Realize that there are people around you that love you more than you can imagine. Embrace them. Open up. Be someone that you never thought you could be.

Even if you THINK she hates you. You don't know for sure. You'll never know unless she herself tells you. Even than a females feelings can be swayed in a matter of seconds. One second they can love you. The next they can hate you. The next they're falling back in love with you all over again. It just takes YOU to make that change. Never go backwards though always STRIVE to be the best you can EVER be.

The only ways I know how to fix your situation is just by doing the things I'm going to tell you now.

- Go out with friends
- Cut contact with them. I don't care if you have to delete them from your life. As in Facebook, texts, letters, EVERYTHING. Put all those things. Lock them up and don't look at them until you can finally one day see them and be like ""Heh.. those were some good times"".
- All the mistakes you made. IT'S OK PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES! We're all human! That's why we're human. Because we make mistakes. The difference is
- Seek new companions (friends) and make them good bonds
- Work out (yes this is definitely something that helped me so much)
- You owe them NOTHING. Absolu-fucking-tely NOTHING.
- Meet new females (YES)
- Date other girls (I know this sounds extremely hard but just try it out. But also give yourself that space needed. Do not lead anyone on as that is the WORST thing you can do. Be respectful of her feelings.)
- Change the WRONGS you did in the relationship and fucking work at it as hard as you can.
- Everything you did RIGHT in the relationship keep at it. Do it even MORE so than you did before. Why in the fuck not? It's what made her attracted to you. Who's to say it won't attract another beautiful lady right around the corner.
- Take time to allow yourself to heal before you jump into another relationship though. Never just jump into something. It's called a rebound relationship for a reason. It's to delay the healing process and it'll only hurt you and the other later on down the line
- Take time to appreciate things around you and see things for what they really are. You'll see how much just a small walk through the park by yourself can do. Even better go for a walk with a friend.
- Man up. Become a man! No woman wants a crying blubbering fool. Be confident in your ability to attract others and attract them properly and well.
- Go out with your boys! Fuck man there are so many things to do in town. Go to a bar, go shoot some billiards, do a poker night, have a drink at the park, go to a friends house play some video games, there are a TON of things!
- Go out with some girls! Go to a movie with them, have some gossip get to know the ins and outs! It shows the women you truly care. It's true though right?
- Go out with people that will be willing to have an open ear. Really it does help a lot trust me.
- Do not be afraid to cry when you're with somebody (that is of course comfortable with you). Or by yourself. It takes time to heal these wounds.
- Time is everything at this point. Do not be afraid to take as much time as you need.
- ALWAYS FUCKING REMAIN RESPECTFUL. I can't fucking stress this enough. I'm always going to be the respectable ""good guy"". Why? Why in the fuck not. I don't care if a girl is going to go for a ""bad guy"" figure. That's their loss. I'm not gonna cry over something that I have no control over. If they want somebody who isn't going to treat them right. Then by god damnit let them. You'll end up with somebody even better and then they'll be like ""Where did all the good guys go. Why can't I ever find somebody like that"". Well guess what you gave that person a chance they didn't want to take it. So now you gave that chance to someone else and THEY appreciate it. End of story.
- Always grow as a person. Never stop!
- Pick up a new hobby it could be anything. There are SO many things you can do in this world it's surprising. Pick up a dance class, soccer, football, basketball, tennis, bowling, billiards, and etc. Just think of all the possibilities.
- Do not let that hate in your heart grow ever. Allow that person to live the life they want. What more can you do but smile and be happy for them? It sounds like the fucking hardest thing you can do at this point. But if you really want to grow as a person. GROW UP. Be happy for them. You think I wanted to see my ex with a new guy holding hands? No of course not. But I smiled. Shook the guys hand. Smiled at her gave her a hug and said ""Hey what's up"". After that I walked away and said ""Alright I gotta go peace!"".
- Prove to yourself you're better than you really are. Don't fucking digress I can't stress this enough. I've said this so many times already. Never ever fucking go backwards.
- Pick up a job! If you don't already have one. With all the new time on your hands might as well make all the money you can.
- Learn to be single. This is my last one. Learn to live with it. You were single before. You are single now. It's just getting back into the habit of things. But like I said don't move backwards.

All this I compiled up over the last 2 months of my breakup. I learned it the hard way but it was worth learning. I've become a better person and I'm not going to go backwards. I'm going to show that next girl that I AM worth being with. That she'll be like ""Woah damn who is this guy. There's something about him.. maybe I should ask HIM for his number"".

If people tell you that you can't change. Don't believe them. I will never believe that saying until the day that I die. People CAN and WILL change. It's how we evolved as humans and it's how we better ourselves. If a person can't change you are not growing as a person. The moment you believe you can't excel at something and get past that plateau in life you're nothing but a burden on yourself. CHANGE FOR YOURSELF. CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. CHANGE FOR GROWTH. CHANGE FOR SELF WORTH. Most of all Change for your LIFE. The day that I die is the moment I stop believing that I can CHANGE as a person. PEOPLE DO CHANGE. You just have to put in the effort to allow yourself to change. 

This applies to women as well. WOMEN &amp; MEN here on /r/breakups. YOU WERE WITH SOMEBODY FOR A REASON. NOW CHIN UP AND BECOME THAT WOLF THAT CHASES AFTER THE DEER. DO NOT BE THE DEER THAT IS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WOLF!

DO NOT FORGET. The BEST form of revenge is SUCCESS. Be successful in your endeavors! Do them well. Do them proud. BE SUCCESSFUL!

1352671088.0,131167,I think I did it,ilwdcb,82,13,27,"I went to a party last night with several of my friends. While I was there, subconsciously.

I woke up this morning super hung over. I was kinda just laying there, it kinda hit me. None of the things I thought about had anything to do with her. I was just thinking vaguely about my own life, and she wasn't a part of those obscure thoughts.

When I realized that, and anger and feeling slighted and confused for the bad times and the break up and everything that's happened since. In the time since the break-up, I couldn't reconcile the difference between those good times and the person I believed her to be, and the person I was currently observing and the negative ideas. It was like an argument going on in my head, where the sentimental part of me didn't want to acknowledge what the rational part of me was understanding. For whatever reason, even though she wasn't in love with me anymore, I was scared of falling out of love with her

I guess at some point, but didn't long for them. I thought about the bad times, and I didn't get angry or upset. They're just a memory. Then I thought about everything we shared. The things that were a part of me that I shared with her, I've wanted nothing to do with them, they were painful to me. I don't feel that way anymore, those things are still precious to me, they're a part of who I am.

The things she shared with me, from the people I've loved or cared about at one point or another in my life. Those things come together to form the man I am. I can still like the music she introduced me to, things like that. That's ""me"" now, not ""us.""

I'm not in love with her anymore. I'll probably always care about the woman I saw in her, and it's a bummer, but I've always had so many people still around that I've cared about, and that have cared about me.

I'm not perfect, but only in the same respect I'd hope anyone would.

When you hear or see any glimpse of your ex right after your break up

But over time, and the time it takes to recover gets shorter and shorter. Despite NC, we are sometimes bound to hear/find out something we don't want to. 

I just got sent a photo from a mutual friend of her and my ex both making funny/weird faces. It caught me a bit off guard. I don't even know if my ex knew it was being sent to me or whatever, I'm doing really well with my recovery. I feel like I'd be ready to date other women if I see someone who interests me. However, even seeing pictures of her, or seeing her in person still bothers me. **BUT** it's no longer in the sense of ""Ugh, why did she leave?"" or ""Why can't we be together?"" but more so, ""Get this bitch out of my face because I have better things to do."" 

*And that mindset starts coming a lot sooner each time*. I'm not lying. It's become more of an annoyance, and she just seems to get in the way of it. 

We were both at fault for the relationship's demise (as is the case in most), whereas she chose not to. That's fine, it's her arrogance/ignorance, and not my concern to deal with. I know what to fix for next time, when it matters. I don't care for her apology, nor do I care for her coming back. Seriously, /r/prettygirls reinstated my faith in female beauty when I thought I wouldn't find anyone more attractive than my ex. I made a huge realization a while ago. It was a realization that many had stated, it had to come from within myself.* I realized that I have a choice.* 

Now, *better* lifestyle, and *better* women. Since the break up, I've worked out every day, and constantly been on a healthy diet. I'm on the verge of looking photoshopped. I had a choice to splurge on comfort foods, but I promised myself that there was no fucking way that I would come out weaker from this. Whenever my parents left the house; at first, I would use that time to mope and cry. Now, I would cancel plans with friends to stay home. Now

I've noticed that I'm much more comfortable in being alone, I got *better*. I've gotten so much more productive with my time. I have tons more money because now I'm not wasting spending hundreds of dollars on someone who would later go on and say she didn't care for it. My hair looks *fantastic*, and I recently bought a whole new wardrobe from my trip in NYC/Chicago because I decided it was time to reinvent. 

I'm not trying to brag, you do emerge the victor, as long as you make the best out of it. You have a choice. Easier said than done, I know. But work hard now so you can reap the profits later. Use this time to reinvent yourself, and just fucking kill it. Even if you feel you were at fault for the break up (which I highly doubt you were entirely responsible for), use this break up to improve those areas of your life. Use this time to develop your character, not degrade it. Don't let yourself become the villain of your own story. What your ex did to you is no longer relevant. Pain is inevitable

I went to the local coffee shop we always went to together, get my drink, and leave. I was fresh out of the gym, a little sweaty and wearing a tank top that showed off my new body. Since I had last seen her, I had lost 10 lbs of fat and put on 40 lbs of muscle. I was looking good :D. As a bonus, I was wearing sunglasses so she couldn't see where i was looking. This was literally the perfect scenario.

I saw her car in the lot and my heart started going for the first time in a while, didn't say a word, got my drink and left. I watched her watch me walk away through the outside window.

Let me just say friends, even though nothing seems fair, I feel that after today the Universe balances shit out every now and then. 

There's going to be pain, there's going to be good times, great times. Times where you realize you haven't thought about them in days. Times when you look in the mirror and are proud of the reflection looking back. Times where you reject your sadness and anger and move on powerfully. Times when you meet that next person that you never expected would sweep you off of your feet. Times where you can say for the first time in what feels like a lifetime that you are happy.

1364439879.0,1b5ll8,Want your Ex-Girlfriend back? Heres a tip my mother gave me when I was young worked on 3 out of 3 GF's,Haikuyori,96,29,56,"Allegory of the seed 

As told to me at a young age by my mother

Breaking up can be hard

First you plant the seed: take a small object, tell her to keep it, do not tell her why, just be as nice as possible i.e. “here, Id like you to have this, I had an amazing time getting to know you, and I thank you for allowing me that opportunity” and then walk off into the fucking sunset like the lone rider.

Now you water the seed: Despite what your brain, working out, playing video games whatever you did before having a girlfriend. DO NOT CALL HER. She will call you, whether it be a couple days, weeks, and in some cases months, and when she does, lonely judgment keep it short
Just be short, tell her you’ve been doing well, ask her how she’s been doing, then tell her that you are going out, or you would like to talk more but there’s things you need to do, (make sure to smile while talking, they can hear your smile) and then tell them good bye. With this they will start thinking that you are over her, and most of all it doesn’t make you look easy, and you will start to seem desirable. If this doesn't maker her ask for you back then lets move to the next step.

The sprouting of the seed: After some time, she’s only human) she will look at the trinket you gave her and think to herself “After all this time, after all my boyfriends, this guy (meaning you of course), treated me well” that trinket will be imbued with nothing but kindness and warmth, she will constantly think of you and in the end, she will call you and ask for you back.

The blooming of the flower: Now the plant is fully grown, its what ever you want it to be. In my case, all the ex’s did ask for me back, within a short time, some still ask for me back after 7 YEARS, and once the method worked, once they finally gave in and asked for me back, instead I was filled with an ocean full of confidence I never knew I had, happy and confident and made many friends

TL;DR
Seed, plant bam boom fucking confidence.

I don't even expect anyone to read these or necessarily relate

* He *never* had time for me.  Even when things were good between us and he felt strongly about me
* He took me
* He was too reserved for me.  I'm very outspoken and I don't mind someone who is more quiet
* He never complimented me or told me how he felt about me.  He did in the very beginning
* Back to being too reserved, and I didn't feel like I could tell him what I wanted.
* He can't handle ""difficult"" or ""uncomfortable"" conversations and would rather avoid them entirely than deal with them.  He seemed uncomfortable talking about condoms
* And last but not least, and he is able to cut me out of his life.

I would just like to say thank you for everyone who have given so much time and support to those who are going through hell dealing with with recent break up or one that lingers on.

I came here in June of this year after the loss of my grandparents and then my girlfriend of 3 years leaving me only to fall into the arms of her bestie from college. A girl I held in high regard as the girl I wanted to be with forever after and was so integrated with on many levels of life with. The end of the relationship was horrible

The point is, to rant. I also have given support to those in similar situations and helped anyone I could give decent advice to. My hell and nightmare this year really could not stack up to other stories Ive read here. The fact we are here to help each other is something bloody beautiful. So I thank you all who have given me support. For those who I could have helped in their time of need of a virtual shoulder to cry on.

This community just rocks. There are no other words to describe it.

Where Am I now.
After the end of the relationship. I worked out, more confident. I said fuck her. I lost the girl of my dreams. I failed, I fucked up. No she fucked up. I dont want her, I dont need her. I wont accept her hand in friendship for replacing/cheating on me after 3 faithful years and dedication through the hardest of times.  That I deserve better. That I will strive to be better. I took her off a pedestal and said fuck off to her ''need'' to be friends after the break up. Deleted all contact info. Everything. Its good that i cannot recall her numbers and email addresses aswell as facebook/twitter/reddit. Actually made this reddit account so she wouldnt track me. Gave up a year of karma in the blink of an eye. 

I went to the gym

I returned to college in good form. With a desire to become the best I can be. Study, study... then sleep). Now, I never thought I would feel again for along long time and that was fine with me but since returning to college I met someone and we became friends over the past month and as of a week we have been dating and having tons of fun. We are pacing ourselves and enjoying finding out more about each other while sharing our interests. Seriously, when your heart skips for a second when I see her.. fuck... I never believed I could feel that again. Its going good and for the first time.. I am not numb, Im happy.

Not everything she said may be applicable to your situation

**So

""If they don't have time to answer your calls or even simply write you on Facebook

Now, like 9 a.m., 10 a.m.ish. Shower, get ready, wear your favorite clothes and go somewhere! DO SOMETHING. Do not go with anyone; just go with yourself. Go somewhere, see something. BE ALONE. You have been with someone for far too long. You need to learn to live with yourself before you can live with anyone else. So get to know yourself again; remember what YOU are like without anyone else around. It is important to stay in touch with that side of yourself. Spending time alone, at least an hour a day if we can find it

So please do this: Go out and get some coffee, like the aviation museum. Make a playlist for your iPod without ANY songs you guys shared. No sad music either. Listen to happy music and be with yourself. It will be hard at first, but you will get the hang of it by the end of the day.

After you do that, be yourself, and do what you want.

When your ex decides that they have time to message you

Give yourself time to find who you are again. You need that.
It does not matter what they are feeling right now

And regarding being outside your house as opposed to being inside

Take tonight off. This is your last night to be stuck in your mind. Start tomorrow fresh. New page. New day. New you. (I know how corny that sounds… but it's true). Never start fresh after 5 p.m. It simply does not work.

And you don't know when you'll truly be happy with who you are. That's the thing about happiness. You are always the happiest you have ever been, every sad or dark time will compare to that. So find who you are tomorrow and then the next day find who you are that day. Wake up, live, and then go to sleep and wake up and do it again. It's the beauty of life; there is always tomorrow. You are brilliant and strong in so many ways, don't let this overshadow the qualities that you are greatest in.

1364442536.0,1b5omv,Everyone says it gets better without saying how. Here's a few pointers how it did for me.,throwmineawry,80,15,21,"I [28M] really thought I was done looking for someone special with my last girlfriend. We burnt brightly but quickly and I was left a wreck wondering if I'd ever be so happy again. Here's what helped

- Friends and family. 

I cried in front of my mother for the first time in 10 years. I told my close friends, some just tried to smile and pat me on the shoulder, some awkwardly went quiet, others said nothing but spoke with actions like made sure I wasn't alone on the weekend or called me more often. You're not alone, there's an army of people behind you that love you, like you and are rooting for you. 

- There will be good days and bad days.

Some days I thought, I'm gonna kick ass and be the awesome human being I know I am. Things would be great. Then the following day I would see something that would remind me of her and I'd be down again. I would then beat myself up that I had relapsed and felt pathetic. You're not pathetic. There are good and bad days in work, in sport, in weather and life in general. Sometimes we can do something constructive to fix/avoid these (like stop checking her facebook) and sometimes we just have to accept today was a crap day and tomorrow we try again. It's not about the how good/bad the day was, it's about the overall trajectory, and you're getting back up on your feet slowly but surely (even if it doesn't feel like that).

- No contact is good but not always possible.

I live near my ex so we share a gym and a few bars. Sometimes I would see her car in the street. We had some contact via text, try and be the bigger person. Be friendly but respectful. Desperation and childish behaviour only make things worse. Just be a decent person, if they don't reciprocate, that's their problem not yours. Don't be friends until you're ready to visualise them having sex with someone you know who you don't particularly like (yeh hurts doesn't it?). When it comes to the digital world, block, hide, deactivate, clear your history

- You have more free time now!

Remember how you said you really needed to finish that project for work? That you never read as much as you'd like? That you would like to cook/workout/see your friends more? That you wanted to volunteer? Go do that stuff! Someone loved you for who you are before and someone else will love that person someday too BUT YOU'LL ALSO KNOW HOW TO ROCK CLIMB!

- She/he was not that special.

Think of all the people you've been with (or even had a crush on). I bet they were all different. One had that hilarious laugh, one did that amazing thing with their tongue... How do you feel about these people now? Do you miss them that much? Do you care who they're sleeping with or if they think about you? I don't. I bet you can list some not so nice things about them too. You enjoyed your time with them, it didn't work out. You don't think about them often but wish them well. It just took time and this breakup will one day be the same.

- Learn from it

I loved how she made real coffee in the morning, that's mine now. Her secret baked potato recipe, not secret anymore, mine. Be a vulture. Take what's useful left from the carcass and toss the rest. Could you have been more assertive, attentive, secure etc? Put it in your locker and save it for the next game son. 

- (for the dumpees) They chose a life without you. 

Would you keep putting dollar bills into a vending machine that ate them? Would you keep inviting that ""friend"" who flakes on you? No. Because time and love are precious resources and you don't waste them where you don't get a return (or worse, love and awesomeness on them, they don't deserve it. They think they can do better. Good luck, so can I.

- Don't rebound

Rebounds are cheap. Rebounds are temporary. Ultimately, secure, active person, you'll want and achieve so much more than rebounds.

- Feel pathetic? Not yourself? Be better.

Look at r/decidingtobebetter r/getmotivated and remember you're better. At a certain point, now are you going to feel sorry for yourself or are you gonna smile, lick your lips and say ""bring it on"".

1367697725.0,1dp040,This needs to be said. For everyone here.,Orielle,67,5,20,"I've decided I need to help everyone here in any way I possibly can. So I'm going to relay what worked for me.

 We all have one thing in common, either way, -our relationship ended-

Now keep in mind

1. You are -not- alone. Friends &amp; Family


-Everyone- has friends &amp; family, but have your best interest in mind. The fact that you're even reading this proves my point. I'm with you, we're all with you. If your flame has gone out we will ignite it once more, this time stronger than ever, so you too can burn as bright as the sun and give others the same light.


Now there's a reason I put friends first, which most often will come from your friends. 

Be warned though, and the person you had it with. While it is not healthy to become blinded by your emotion, it is also in turn not healthy to listen to everything your friends &amp; family tell you. Strike a balance, and try your best to think of everything from an outside perspective. Let logic dictate where it should, and you will be better off.


2. No Contact and the J-word


There is one reason, if you show them via contacting them you give them justification for their decision- If you go to them and become angry, they feel justified because their reasoning will be you're emotional. If you go to them and are sad/crying/want them back, again they will justify themselves and say you need to be happy by yourself etc etc.

This is why you do absolutely nothing. By doing nothing you take from them everything. They no longer have any surface or base with which to support their reasoning. This is both the easiest and the hardest step because our egos -want- us to be in control

3. Acceptance


Accept three things : That the person, and accept whatever mistakes you may have done(2). I mean actual mistakes though. Sometimes you didn't do anything wrong, it's just the other person is a retard and can't see a good thing. For instance never apologize for being nice to someone, or for caring about them. If the other person has a problem with those things then -fuck them- You need to be who you are, and you need to be fine with it.

Now if you've made any mistakes, because if that golden moment appears that we all so desperately want, and they do come back, you don't want to fuck it up again. However you also need to accept reality(3) : If they didn't love/care for you enough the first time, chances are they will only care for you less the second, or any other repeat times.

 This is especially true if you try to be ""friends"" after a break-up. What on God's earth makes you think they'll care about you more, and you should never lower yourself to such a trashy standard. You are not an emotional tampon.

4. Time time time


First off

Too many people think they have to ""experience"" this thing, but the point remains!)  That way of thinking is not only selfish, and self destructive, but it also creates havoc for people like us. People who genuinely care.

Realize that you have all the time in the world, but most importantly, do something that you can -share- with others. 

Always wanted to go see the grand canyon? Call some friends and make a plan for a road trip. Always wanted a tattoo? Go out and fucking get it. Whatever you do, interacting. Life is like the ocean, you just have to dive in, and once you do it will embrace you just like the water. It has it's dangers sure, but smart choices and a good head on your shoulders will always see you through.

5. 6,433


That's the population of our world. The odds that there -isn't- someone out there that is exactly right for you, sure, but you still have the most important thing. Look down, put your hand on your chest. Yeah, your heart is still there. I feel it too ya know. I'm here. We're all here. Close your eyes and you can see us, and if you listen carefully on a quiet night, you'll hear us too.

1356897950.0,15oowr,This might help...,karlmoebius,78,17,19,"What I have learned

You are an addict. No, and the pain of separation is the species way to encourage you to keep seeking out companionship. You are a companionship addict.

And now you've just quit cold turkey. Lucky you, you are detoxing. You would do anything, go through whatever hoops, no matter how painful they might be later, or how you know that it's a bad idea to do it, to re-experience what you had. Sound familiar?

Now, nor will it be without pain. There's really isn't any methadone, weaning, patches, gum, or pills. It's just you getting up in the morning and enduring it every single hour of every single day until you get over it -- as people have done since the beginning of time. Look around you in a crowded store, and realize that everyone you see has gone through what you're going through now. 

You. are. not. alone.

The best way to imagine dealing with it, it can become a recursive feedback loop. Then you do other things that do not remind you of what you've stopped doing, and more importantly do things that do raise those brain chemicals up; it helps. More importantly, it helps control the mood swings and helps even out you as a person. Force yourself to do these things. It's all too easy to sit on your ass moping and sinking deeper and deeper in that hole than knowing where you’re headed and getting out. 

Go out. Seek out friends. Go out to see a movie. Go out to eat. Go out and eat foods you've never had, try building an airplane model, do something that isn't just sitting there and letting yourself slowly spiral down.

Do not get into a relationship during this time. Period. Have friends, yes. But until you break the addiction you should not reengage. You are not ready.

Here are some Great Truths you have to engrave into your soul: you have to be at peace with the possibility of being single the rest of your life. You have to be at peace knowing that your burdens are, but be aware that there is a fine line between someone helping you, and you depending on them to shoulder your problems. You have to be able to look at yourself honestly and see your flaws... and then strong enough to seek out help to fix them. You can always be a better you. Mentally, physically, emotionally. You have to know you can do it by yourself at all times whatever happens, however out of your depth you are, you must know how to help yourself. It's not easy. But neither is what you're going through.

Time passes. You still get twinges. Sometimes something will happen and you'll hurt. Then, after you're your own person, standing on your own two feet and self sufficient, you're getting help, you're getting hobbies, you're single, you have friends, or ever before... then you're ready for the next relationship.

The best part is now that you're stable; with any luck you're better able to spot the ones who aren't stable like you. It narrows your dating pool

It's not easy. It's not fast. But anything really worth is never is. To quote

You will get through this. You just have to be the most stubborn son of a bitch to walk the face of the earth.

1370318778.0,1fmq9i,Epiphanies,GayGuyAdvice,69,9,18,"We're all on this subreddit commiserating the loss of our relationships. Losing a best friend, thinking about the investment and how much time you've wasted

When was the last time you were happy single? Were you ever happy single? If you were

I think we all lose a bit of ourselves when we're in a committed relationship. Sometimes because the partner picks up the slack, well, extremely comfortable. You've got sex when you want, you've got someone to hang out with you if you want, you've got someone who knows you really well and does things that make you feel pleasurable. Stuff that you used to have to work a bit towards and make more of an effort to satisfy for yourself--if you've ever been happy alone. Of course losing that in a split second gives you the withdrawl symptoms of a heroin addict. 

The drive to improve yourself is self-motivating and driven perhaps by the subconscious desire to be an attractive mate. Once in a relationship those desires become less evident and we lose ourselves. We've replaced things that we did to make ourselves happy with things our partners did for us. Or you've stopped doing things that you liked because your partner didn't like them. Or you've stopped doing them because you used the time to invest more into the relationship. 

You've changed as an individual. You are not who you are when you met and neither are they. Being able to adapt to each other while growing as individuals is the hallmark sign of a good relationship. Being able to grow as individuals in a relationship is also extremely important. Stifling each other will only add resentment about each other. I admit I became more clingy after each separation, you take it for granted. Once that happened the spark begins to lose its luster and minor faults quickly become nagging dealbreakers. 

Are you constantly thinking of them having sex with other people? Do you find yourself thinking of them when you masturbate? Do you miss their touch, stop it. They're probably dealing with the misery of the separation their own way. It doesn't mean they didn't love you. We as organisms are programmed to want to have sex. Especially when there is nothing else as easy and quick to offer temporary relief from the sadness of a separation. You might not be able to do that, but that doesn't mean your ex is you. We're all very different and shaped by our experiences and to a large degree our biology. They may have had three one night stands the week after you broke up. But you went to Paris two months later and had the time of your life. Or you went on a great hike with friends and discovered you were able to hike a 14er and they went to the bar and went home with someone who had bad breath. 

The breakup is an opportunity to find yourself. It is an opportunity to improve yourself and discover new interests, to go commando style and let their air flow up my pants. I plan on projecting confidence into people I interact with, making people laugh, learning how to interact with others and work on my social skills. Basically you need to do exciting, fun, new things without them. This will give you a sense of self, joy

I finally understand why people say take a break from dating after a significant separation. If you work on these while single, only to realize they aren't everything you're looking for. It allows you to reflect and determine what you want in a partner, what you don't want, what red flags to watch out for and what to do to keep that spark going. 

Moreover self-confidence, independence are all fucking attractive qualities to potential suitors. People want those they can't have and if you are happy by yourself they they'll make more of an effort to be a part of your life. That is why playing hard to get works on some people. Except you're not purposely doing this, you're doing this because you are happy by yourself. 

Remember the old adage, more optimistic, more conducive to healing. Instead of thinking how awful you feel in the mornings, how alone you are, how much you miss them, rephrase it into what skills will I improve today, I have friends who care about what I'm going through right now

Lastly if it's true love it will find its way back to you. I wouldn't hold out too much hope as it's not good for healing but it's nice to think of it like winning the lottery. It would be spectacular but the chances are slim to none. Those of us separating after multiple reconciliations can feel even more at ease as we've tried our best each and every time that happened. Put some of that effort into making yourself into the awesome person you want to be and I am sure people will notice the new you and you will be much happier in the long-term. Turn yourself into someone your ex will regret dumping. The best revenge is living well. But don't ruminate over the revenge and regret too much as you may never get that satisfaction. Use it to motivate yourself until you don't need it anymore. 

Moreover if you've had previous loves

It's been a week. I did a bit of emailing and pleading but ultimately realized they were futile. I sent a quick letter saying I understand his choice. I don't regret our relationship and I wish him the best. Put some closure to things and get yourself pumped up about this next step of your life. Take it a step at a time, then happy, then excited. Go for it.

**So you want to get her back huh?  (A conversation with myself)**


So you want her back huh?  You guys have spent 7 years together and she is the love of your life.  She is highly compatible with you and it feels like life situations are the only reasons you’re not together…



Hold your horses.  **You want to know how to get your ex back?  It’s simple.  MOVE ON.**  Assume you’re not going to get her back and live your life.  Be happy.  I know at first you thought that if she saw how miserable you were then she’d want you back.  *This is a horrible strategy.  All that does is create pity and guilt.*  It doesn't make someone want to BE with you however.  The same things that made you attractive in the first place are going to be the same things that would win an ex back.  If you’re happy and living your life you will be attractive.  

It’s basic laws of attraction here.  Think about it, not bring them down.  But if the situation were the opposite and you saw an ex happy and having the time of their life without you, you instantly want them back in some way shape or form.

  
The irony of all this is that when you’re on that journey you completely forget about trying to win the other person back.  You’re genuinely experiencing happiness.

To everyone who's experiencing the latter because of a break-up, it doesn't matter if it's over or in the grey area, it doesn't matter if you *think* they were the only person you could ever feel this way for. All of the thoughts of them that you can't shake, the feelings when you wake and fall to sleep - they are just objects of habit.

1334076451.0,s2r5e,Letting Go of a Relationship - Cindy Thomas,rawrmeansfu,65,5,19,"One of the hardest things to do in life is to let go of a relationship. No matter what the cause of a breakup, a boyfriend or girlfriend


Recovering from the horrible pain and hurt of a broken relationship is no easy task. When love is found


Turning off feelings for someone isn't like turning off a light switch. When a relationship ends, anger, grief, rejection, and despair can prove to be overwhelming. The person might find themselves attempting to contact the other person, making up reasons to be where the other person is, calling them repeatedly, it prevents us being healed of the relationship.


In order to let go and live again, and no amount of wanting, wishing, or regret will undo or changed what's already happened and is over with.


To put closure on the past, dependency, guilt, resentment, and anger... all of these feelings must be dealt with and brought under control. While they are normal to feel, continuing to harbor them keeps you from being healed of the hurt, and therefore keeps you from living and being happy again.


Often when a relationship ends, you will learn that your self worth does not revolve around another person but rather is enhanced by the other person.

While there is just no way to magically heal the pain and hurting of a lost relationship


* Stop beating yourself up over the past. It's done, no amount of blaming yourself or feeling guilty will undo the past. Forgive either the other person or yourself (or both) and allow yourself to be happy again.


* Unless you have children together, don't email them, don't follow them around. Leave them alone! Continuing to attempt to be in contact with them (unless you have kids) does nothing but harass them and keep you tied to the pain.

* Go out on dates with others and actually enjoy yourself. Have fun! And whatever you do

These vows are not specific to marriage. When one commits to any relationship, regretfully, illegal), or even just friends, *you silently agree to always be there for each other*.  When one person ends a relationship, they're choosing to break this trust and bond. They've decided that some thing, some idea about you

Sounds harsh

They've weighed the pros and cons, you lost your leg in combat and they can't handle the stress of helping you through therapy. Whatever it is, forget about it. **It's their excuse, not yours. Let them live with it while you forget about it.** 

They have left behind somebody that is a loyal person, and find somebody that you **can** trust with it.

Also, to high-five, to play laser tag with. Somebody who, when you look into their eyes and they smile back, fills you with the most warmth you've felt; and, to the same degree, should you ever upset them, especially by you, I know she wouldn't have stuck by me and I don't know what my personal reaction would be to waking up with nobody to support me. I don't want someone who gives up so easily. And neither should you

That's my rant. Thanks to this epiphany

EDIT: I've come to the realization that the only lingering feelings I'm having at this point are fear. I'm afraid--because I do still love her--that something awful will happen to her and I'll never know, so there's no reason for me to care if she ever disappeared, because essentially she already has.

You need to treat what love brings you with kindness.  If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you

If you find someone else in love with you toward whom you feel no love, do not cause pain.  How you deal with love is how love will deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are very different.

If you fall in love with another who falls in love with you, but time itself will choose the moment.

Remember this and keep it in your heart.  You don't choose love.  Love chooses you.  All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life.  Feel the way it fills you to overflowing

Love has its own time, from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and nothing you should do.  Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life.  If you keep your heart open, it will surely come again.'

1) Your mind is so used to being attached to this person, your heart aches for the routine you and your significant other had. It can't be over, there's still so much unfinished business. It can't be over, I love them. It just can't be over. I do not have the ability to accept that.

2) People always say, be productive. This is all really good advice. However, it means NOTHING. Hobbies are temporary distractions. Thinking of finding another relationship seems so far away. Reading a book and going to the gym will only distract me for a small amount of time. The sheer pain, anxiety, sadness, and nostalgia makes hobbies obsolete. The thought of finding someone new sounds so beautiful but so far fetched. I have to start over? When will I find this person? Do I even want to subject myself to this again?

3) The nights and the mornings. Keeping busy with friends and hearing ""this was meant to be, you are already meeting new people. Life's not so bad, after all. Maybe you will move on. Maybe I will get over this. Then I come home. The thoughts run rampant. He/she is not here anymore. Those memories that are now replaying in your head? Forget them, they no longer have meaning. The way things ended? Doesn't matter, nothing matters anymore except moving on. I can't move on. When you finally do sleep, you wake up. I found mornings to be worse. What will I do with my day? He/she is not here anymore. That's all I can think in the nights and the mornings. Something is missing. Something isn't right.

4) Are they hurting as much as I am? Are they okay with this? Are they crying on bathroom floors, and binge drinking too?  They have to be haunted by our memories. We just spent so long together, they have to feel what I'm feeling, right?

A little background story:
I'm a [f] 23 and he was [M]26, now. By far the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

I guess it just goes to show that even though I dumped him and he thinks it has been a walk in the park for me

Relationships are tough. You put your everything into someone, again. Peoples' advice only helps out so much, and in the end.. you are left with a gaping hole in your heart that seems as though it will always be there. That is why we come to this reddit community, why we cry, why we can't sleep at night, and why the memories haunt us. Heartache is real and it's hard.

1358969424.0,1750ph,To anyone hurting please read: An update and advice on how to get through it. ,toeveryoen,61,4,24,"I can't link back to my older posts as I used throwaways because I just browse reddit and made accounts to post. Regardless

**My update:**

I dated a girl for 2 years. We were each other's first loves. Hung out every day and I thought I'd never lose her. School starts back up and she one day tells me she needs to find herself and can't be with me. She tells me maybe in the future we can get together but not now. 

A week later I hear through people that she made out with a few guys. I'm devastated. I see her two weeks after that and she has hickeys on her neck. I am devastated again. I then find out she gave a fraternity brother a blow job. I get upset. My fraternity brothers ( I was a pledge) realize this is going to become a problem so I am kicked out. I now have lost a lot of my friends at school. My only friends are back home. I become good friends with her old best friend who decided to pick me over my ex. The friend and I become very close

 I hear how she is sleeping around and the thought of her now having sex with other guys kills me. She won ""Most flirtatious"" in her sonority. All of this really hurts me. 

We go back home for break and our friends have a party. They invite both of us. Its around 15 people so it is somewhat awkward. I avoid my ex because I don't want to talk to her and she gets upset. She comes up to me and starts complaining about how I blocked her on facebook etc. I walked away. 

Later that night though, but I have made some friends who have now tried to get me on track.

The past few months of the break up I sat in my room afraid to go outside. I didn't want to see life for the positive



**What I have learned and why you should never give up:**

1. To start off.. No contact. You see this a lot yet people always ask ""should I block my ex?"" Yes. In every way. Block on facebook, remove the number from your phone, delete pictures from your phone (or save on computer but get it off your phone). GET YOUR EX OUT OF YOUR LIFE. Yes.. It hurts. Yes, it sucks. But if you are afraid to take these steps you are still living in the past. Make the choice to move on. 

2. Change the way you think. I was dumped and she tried to ruin my life by harassing girls I was with etc. I've lost many people because of her. I played victim for four months, she left me, I want her back"" I changed my head voice to ""I am choosing to go down a different path in my life. It is scary but it is what I want in the end."" Change your sad thoughts into ""I.."" give you the power. It takes time but I was able to turn all my negative feelings into inspiration because I started living for me and controlled my thoughts, not living a life in my past. 

3. Don't feel pressured to meet new people. This might be contrary to what a lot of people say but I find this true. A period of breaking up is feeling upset. Sometimes you need to accept it. A lot of my depression would come by forcing myself to be social when I wasn't ready and I would end up hurting myself. Break ups are natural and healing a broken heart is natural. It takes time. Don't feel guilty if you feel like staying in by yourself. HOWEVER

3b. With this being said, all your friendships will be tested. You will be seeing people leave your life and people who come out of no where to help you. Take note of who truly cares about you and your well being and who doesn't want to deal with you when you are hurt. Relationships are tested when the shit hits the fan. Who will help you clean up?

4. Don't be afraid of change. This is a period of change whether you like it or not. Reevaluate who your friends are. Start exercising. Make a schedule to study and stick to it. Be the person you want to be. Start something new. Learn to speak a language or play piano. Gain something out of the pain you are going through

5. There is no competition. I don't care about your ex. If he/she has a new GF/BF that is great. Who the fuck cares? Don't feel like you need to compete. Do not feel pressured because your ex seems so happy so you should be happy too. Some nights I know she is at parties and I'm at home. This used to kill me inside. But then i realized.. My life is my life and I need to do what makes me happy. Be concerned with yourself and not anyone else.

6. Find inspiration. I've planned to travel this summer with my buddies and constantly find things to look forward to in my life. FIND WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY. Make yourself better. Understand how important school is and work hard. I just got the highest GPA I have ever gotten because I recommitted myself to wanting to go to law school. I know what I want and I'm going to get it. For myself. Not for anyone else. I have a plan, I know that I'll just have to find a new one.

Life moves on at the same pace, single or in a relationship. Think about that. 

Understand that everything will be better and that you'll come out of this looking back and being thankful you were not with someone who doesn't deserve you. To anyone who reads this: I do not know you, our lives could be drastically different.

Keep on trucking

***DO NOT BE AFRAID TO FAIL. Fail so many times you just laugh. Learn to fail and I promise you will be a lot happier.***

Hi everybody, and it also might provide some insight for those of you who are making progress well beyond mine. Either way, feel free to share your thoughts on how your first month post-breakup has been! I get the feeling that a lot of this stuff is relatable, so I'd love to hear your One Month stuff.

**The Breakup**

I'm [21/m] and I got dumped 9 months into a relationship by my first love, after several weeks of cold and distant behavior, ended it suddenly and without any interest in rebuilding. For me, getting dumped was an absolute tragedy, or at least that's how I felt when it happened. I was crushed, devastated, miserable

**Observations on the Importance of No Contact**

The first month has seen only modest improvements in my mental state, I've miraculously resisted the urge to contact her, and I attribute the slight progress I've made this past month to my ability to stay solid on NC.

The most challenging thing about NC is that you are more susceptible to finding other ways of attaching to your ex as an Ideal. The most common example, I would scroll through that dumb little News Ticker thing on the right hand side of Facebook every hour, just looking for crumbs of information about her. I imagine many of you have done this too, and in my opinion, this is my Scumbag Brain's attempt at fighting the withdrawal. No more heroin? Let's huff the stuff under the sink. That's basically what was happening. Fortunately, this side-effect of the breakup is now beginning to subside as well. Thank God.

Of course, or just change your facebook settings so you can no longer receive updates from them. I highly recommend doing the latter.

**Obsessive Thinking/Dreaming**

The first month has a LOT of obsessive thoughts. I've found that, she's who I dream of, and she's who I think of when I wake up. And for the most part, she's all I think about during the day. This hasn't changed or improved at all.

**The New Guy**

My ex left me and immediately jumped into a rebound relationship. It's probably not a serious relationship

Seeing the New Guy in person has to be the most challenging thing to watch during the entire breakup. Nevermind that you'll never talk to her again, so this kinda didn't take me down too many pegs. Can't really go from rock bottom to rockier bottom, now can you?

My theory is that we all will get over our exes

**My New Girl**

I don't have one. That's the worst part about being a guy. We gotta work for our rebounds, and put on the backburner in the event that the relationship doesn't pan out. Such was the case with my ex.

As for me, but for guys, I think that sex is quite unnatural after a breakup. But I could be wrong. Girls - when you have a rebound, what is it like? Do you think about your ex consciously while you are having sex? Do you feel worse when you're done? Does it even help? I can't imagine that it helps much.

**Coming to Terms

The first month involves a lot of letting go, you gotta let go of the actual person. This is the hardest part for me, because my ex was a true friend. We talked so openly and honestly with each other, and our emotions were so intimately connected on a personal level. Letting go of the love hurts, but letting go of the friendship is truly a challenge. Expect a lot of inner bargaining here. I found myself saying ""We will be friends eventually, it would be a shame to let our friendship die too."" Well now I'm realizing that it's just gotta happen.

I do not believe that you can remain friends with somebody who has broken up with you. How can I ever be a friend to somebody with whom I once shared such deep, has sealed us apart forever. Friendship is not possible after love.

**Crying**

I cried a lot the first weekend I was dumped. Then I stopped. The reason I stopped, that she will be there once this love fades. It might take 6 months, a year, or whatever, but eventually we'll be back together as old friends. Wrong. She's gone for good. And when I accepted that, I started crying again. I cried last weekend, and I tear up almost every day for the last couple days. This is where I'm at with the crying

**Talking with Friends/Family**

Talking about it has become easier, ""Get over it.""

That's why coming here is so therapeutic

Keep talking about it though. Talk to anybody who will listen.

**Some Cool Tips

Work out at the gym. I go to the gym regularly anyway, I leave feeling refreshed, and every so often I leave thinking, ""Whoa! I didn't think about her for like 30 minutes while I was in there!"" Not thinking about her for 30 minutes, for me anyway...there's no better feeling in the world.

Another trick. Imagine you had to talk to her face to face tomorrow. Let's say you guys have a coffee date. What would you say to her? Write out a script for what you'd say, too - an exact script of every single thing you want to tell her. When you think you've gotten it nailed down, and you think you really told her off good, save the document and put it away in a folder or something. Come back to it a week later and start from scratch. Edit it and adjust it based on how you are currently feeling. Scrap the stuff that might've sounded kinda rude and harsh, and replace it with the feelings you have now. Once it's perfect again, save it as ""Script 2"" and hide it away. Do this every week, and accumulate these scripts. After a while, more aloof

Another tip, doesn't matter with what. I had a shit-ton of errands I had to run yesterday, like literally 10 different places I had to drive to in one day. Took me all morning and most of the afternoon, and it wasn't fun and it wasn't being done with my ex in mind. It's just stuff I had to do. But wow, being busy really helps you not think about your ex! If being busy means joining a club or meeting new people, do that too! Whatever it takes to keep your mind off it!

**Fears for the Future

I'm not sure what fears I have for the future. Some fears are stupid

I fear that I'll continue to hurt forever (I've been told otherwise around 350

I fear that she has already moved on without me and is doing just fine

I fear that I'll never love a girl the way I loved her.

I fear that my ache when I see her with other guys will linger.

I fear that I'll be alone for a long time.

BUT

I don't care anymore if she talks to me ever again.

I don't care about what she is doing at any given point in the day. Although sometimes I do

**Final Thoughts**

What I'm trying to say is that one month is still not enough time to solve everything. Just a few days ago

Again, but you really didn't have to!

The ultimate thing here is to hear YOUR stories! Are you approaching the one month mark like I have? Did you just get past it? What was it like for you at this time? If you aren't here yet

I don’t miss you. I miss being able to call you mine. Now I realize my reasons for wanting you were primarily superficial. You are a very handsome man with a good personality, but after trying I think we both realized our sexuality was the glue holding us together those months. 

A huge weight has been lifted because now I see that I can find someone who I’m really attracted to on more levels than just sexually (and vice versa).

So a few months ago I started seeing someone else and he has been such a great guy to me. I have informed him that my ex has been contacting me and he was not too happy about. So last night I decided to let him have it once and for all.

On Wednesday morning, he decided that he no longer needed to talk and sent me very trite comments like 'i'm fine now, I was just upset blah, blah blah...and then I just snapped. I realized he was just using me again so I sent him this:

""Please stop contacting me. You're just using me. You couldn't care less about my feelings and whenever I needed you (hospital, sad etc.) you told me it wouldn't be fair to K if we talked. Yet, when something goes wrong with you, you come to me with all your doubts and insecurities, expect me to give you advice, and then blow me off. You are not a good friend or boyfriend. How do you think she would feel knowing that you were texting me at 2:30 in the morning? I will not stoop to her level and stay in inappropriate contact with someone else's boyfriend. i am sorry you are having a rough time, but seek help elsewhere. i am in a wonderful relationship with a great guy and your communications are compromising it.

**The Breakup**

*You've just been broken up with. This person you shared so many memories and happy times with

Denial is strong right after the breakup. You don't think it's actually happened.

**Post-Breakup: Month 1-2**

*Your emotions are everywhere. You're lost. Maybe even in denial. You don't know how to feel and you really don't know how to deal. You check up on him/her every day. You want to see how they're doing, social networking sites, etc. but you still try to see what he/she's up to. Every sad song resonates with you. You wallow in sad feelings. When given the opportunity, you unload about your ex and everything to whoever's willing to listen. You ask about him/her constantly, even though you know that it will only make you feel worse if you know he/she's doing fine. Maybe even better. You visit /r/breakups and sad subreddits often, reading stories similar to yours and posting a lot about your own, but really just checking to see if your ex has written or posted anything.*

This stage is when you're most prone to making the biggest mistakes. Your emotions dictate your every action

**Month 3-5**

*You're able to do no contact for longer now. You stop checking up on him/her as often. You're done with feeling miserable and sorry for yourself, hang out with friends more, whatever. You do as much as you can to fill up the day. Sometimes, you even stop thinking about him/her for a little bit. But at the end of the day, when you're all by yourself, he/she pops into your mind again. It's hard to fall asleep, still. You're consumed by your thoughts. Mornings are more or less the same. You wake up feeling kind of empty. Like, gone. You go through the day distracting yourself and everything, but you still want to talk to him/her again. You figure you're at least good enough now to maybe win him/her back. This is a bad idea. But you do it anyway because you're fucking stupid. Maybe your ex contacts you around this time. You try to be wary and not reciprocate

You lie to yourself the most around here. You're better

**Month 6-**

*If your ex hasn't contacted you by now and you've just been going through the months alone, but there's still times when you want to talk to him/her again. You go through periods when you just kind of think about him/her fondly, maybe wishing that the two of you could be friends again. You might still relapse at times.*

You're on the way to really getting over your ex here. You might not be over it

**Post-Post-Breakup**

*You know you're finally over your ex when hearing about him/her with this new person doesn't bother you anymore at all. When you no longer have the need to really want to be his/her friend or to talk to them. You sometimes think about the old times and him/her fondly, and you wouldn't end up feeling shitty or anything about it.*

By the time you reach the end, and that even if you two are strangers now, you're still able to look back and be thankful for the time you two were the most important people in each other's lives.

*PRELUDE - IVE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP*


It's over and you're heartbroken. First, here comes the takeaway: there are two types of pain in the world. Pain that makes you stronger and pain that causes senseless suffering. You need to transform your pain into the former.

*THE PERFECT GIRL - I'VE GOT SUNSHINE ON A CLOUDY DAY*


OK, when you see something funny on tv, when you hear a song, when you're happy and when you're sad. You can't love, you DONT want to love anyone ever again. Who else is gonna have those cute lil eccentricities that you love so goddamn much??? But, there's hope (and in the human condition, a shred of hope goes a very long way) Countless people before us have endured the EXACT SAME FEELINGS. These very same people went on to have meaningful, you lack perspective right now because you're caught up in your sorrow. Soulmates? Pshawww. Nada

*TIME - THE BEST THING ABOUT THE FUTURE IS IT COMES ONE DAY AT A TIME*

As time passes, you're gonna remember those amazing memories with her, but something wonderful will have happened. You won't have any queasiness associated with them. But, you gotta work at it. You know that 6-pack that you decide to get every 3 months but instead you end up plopping on the couch popping Doritos? Yaaaaaa, about that...you're actually gonna have to work for this...

*KEY STEP - I UNLOCKED THE CHEST


There is one crucial key to moving on and feeling happy again. It's realizing that you can live a wonderful life WITHOUT her. Fully internalize this. Just don't say it to yourself. BELIEVE it. It is true. Not because I say it

*MENTAL GAME - THE MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE*

You control your mind. Sometimes, i keeeed. But, seriously it's just not mental...


*PHYSICAL GAME- THE BODY IMMORTAL*

Go out, humans are great creatures - you can be sad and do things all at the same time! Develop hobbies and interests, try to make a positive impact in the world, learn a new skill, network with others, go out and explore. After a while, you're going to be less and less sad. THIS WILL HAPPEN. And gradually, you have no idea how limited your time in this world is - USE IT. It's going to take your mind off her and you'll be doing wonderful things for yourself and others around you. DOUBLE WIN. It's a brand new you - speaking of which...


*IMPROVE - Y U NO MAKE SAME MISTAKE TWICE*

No matter who was at fault, the Sistine Chapel, the Internet. The amazing thing about your situation is you can improve INSTANTANEOUSLY. You control your mind and you can think and act whatever you tell it. And stick to those thoughts and actions forever more. Again, this takes WORK, but you need to ensure that all of this not for nought. Remember? There are two kinds of pain...But after you're done and you've made up your mind to live a certain way from here on end, let go. Don't make it harder on yourself - people do stupid stuff all the time, but the wonderful thing about human beings is (among other things) their capacity to change and adapt. Use this to make yourself stronger.

*CONTACT - CAN WE BE SIAMESE TWINS AGAIN*


Ya you wanna meet her, just don't. You're gonna have to take my word for this. Some of you won't and you'll learn the hard way - be my guest. No matter how persuasive and charming you actually think you are, you're not that persuasive and your charm takes a nosedive when you start to grovel. And speaking of groveling? Duuuude... Not only does your self-image take a hit, but you seem about as attractive as Pee-wee Herman. Seriously, don't. Even if she still cares for you, this is no way to success, man. Think about it - would you be with someone that begged you to be with them? Put yourself in her shoes. Role reversal - it's a beautiful thing.

Anyway, so my relapse wasn't so much into an emotional mess like the first time round, but into a fairly miserable state. I almost instantly didn't feel like eating, didn't drink anything but coffee, didn't exercise any more and I was smoking excessively. Not good for my anxiety or my mental state. And I realised probably 90% of the reason why I've been feeling so shit is because of what I've been doing to myself. And I did a whole lot of that to myself after the breakup, that really didn't serve to help me in any way.

Breakups are painful, even if you've lost your appetite. Take vitamin pills. Drink water and try to exercise. That's the road to getting better, and trust me that's what you want. Don't wallow in self-pity.

Whatever has happened, it made my breakup seem so trivial and meaningless. But one day you'll look back on that painful period of your life and you'll be glad it happened. Now is your chance to take back control of your life and make things better. There'll be hard days and days where it feels as painful as the first day.

I've seen a lot of articles detailing ways to get your ex back, not too many words about the opposite advice.

Sometimes, see below for that one) or you just can't stay away, here are the top 5 reasons why you should NOT get back with your ex.


* **1) It didn't work out in the first place for a reason.**

Think about why you broke up. Think about all the problems you had with your ex. Was he emotionally unavailable  drive you crazy? Was it her incessant flirting with other guys

When you're considering rekindling that flame with your ex lover


* **2) Living in the past prevents you from moving on.**

You may find yourself wanting your ex back because you're currently in a rut. You think back to the good times and wish they were still happening--you remember moonlit dinners, and while a little nostalgia can keep us going in the really bad times, thinking about what happened long ago is no good reason to get your ex back. 

Moving on is often the best medicine after a break up. Dwelling on what's already happened will never move you forward in life--imagine if we as humans were never able to learn from our mistakes. We'd be doomed to make the same stupid mistake for the rest of our lives. If we decided to pick a spouse who didn't appreciate us

* **3) Sure some couples get back together and make it work

You've seen it happen before. Your friend or cousin or best friend's bridesmaid's sister had a horrid break up

Much more often, leads to another break up.


* **4) People don't change.**

I know this is a controversial topic, she's still that same woman who you couldn't make it work with. I promise you, the chances of your ex changing this time around are next to nil. Now, yes people have the capabilities to change--it's not an absolute. People can change their clothes, their hairstyle, even aspects of their personality. But change has to come from inside yourself (and even if you want to change, it is DARN hard). 

Your ex will not change for you. Her personality, 99.9876% of the time those are traits people won't change. You are much better off finding a partner who you don't want to change. A good relationship starts when you accept the other person for who they are, when all the walls are down, when you've seen them at their best and worst, and you love them just the way they are.

* **5) Don't settle for somebody who couldn't keep you around in the first place.**

Even if your ex was the one who initiated the break up and left you heartbroken, so being with your ex wasn't exactly an ideal situation. So why should you settle for such a situation?

The bottom line is that there was a break up. Break up means something was wrong beyond the little annoyances. And all of this says that you can find someone better for you. Someone who won't want to break up with you, you have to move on and not get back together with your ex.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,

About a year and a half ago, was living in hope of us getting back together, I was far removed from my friends and I must have bored them to death with sob stories. All I can say is I wish I'd known about Reddit and these sub-reddits earlier. 

My last relationship went south nearly a week ago

- Realizing that there's billions of other people out there

- Breaking contact. Texting only prolongs the ""what-if"" scenario; ""If we keep texting s/he'll realize what a great person I am and come running back!"" Begging for someone back isn't assertive

- Expecting to get back together in the future is a recipe for disaster. Whether you broke up because they cheated

- If I've tried my absolute best to make something work

- Writing a list of things you didn't like about the person really put things in perspective. She never did nice things for me

- Squeezing the details and digging won't help. If we've stopped talking and I'm moving on

- Oneitis. thedovelamenting mentioned it and they were *so* right. I felt like she was different, I was just infatuated with her. This was a great link: [Oneitis - Dr Nerdlove](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2011/09/oneitis/all/1/)

- Do the things you couldn't


Maybe this post was more for me, and in my opinion, it's her loss.  I've been milking it for all it's worth and been seeing my friends more. I hope I haven't come across like I know it all, but it's all the stuff I've learnt from other people right here.

1369771377.0,1f7xe2,Just an observation,doneanddusted,53,8,40,"Okay /r/BreakUps. I have been a part of this community for the last 2 months now.  For two months I have shared in your sense of loss

I have read many guides and many posts with pointers for people like us who at this moment in time do not possess the most sound judgement.  

I'm not going to make this a post about a guide to survival or getting better.  Hell

Without getting into my story much, here we are.

So this is a list of things I've observed in myself and I am sharing this to offer perspective to others like me who possibly think they're crazy. Hey, /u/doneanddusted, Son, you've lost your marbles. That's right.

Okay, you don't really absorb the enormity or triviality of the situation. You're just blind sided and are more like, whoa, wtf just happened there? You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them. You don't think much. You mope, you plead, you make yourself desperate because hey! The prophecy said she/he was the one. No one else will have such a high midichlorian count ever. etc. etc.  

You try hard to figure out what went wrong, but for most people it is. They just upped and left for whatever reason and they're not going to tell you. So you try several ways to look for closure. 

Yeah, those answers are most probably some that you don't want to hear. So here is one piece of advice even though I said I wouldn't give any. Closure is just you looking to hang on. That shit is over rated. Except the song Closure by this awesome band called Opeth. Now THAT shit.  That shit isn't over rated. But you get the gist.  Don't clamour for it. You're just inviting trouble.  

Now comes the phase where it sinks in that yes, what you did, what they said, past life experiences, you plug into your Animus and use experiences from Desmond, Altair, Ezio and every other fucker you can imagine and then it dawns on you. Man, I got dumped. This phase came to me when I was reasonably stoned [7] and having random epiphanies. Eye opener. What I learnt from this is not profound

Okay, chances are, he/she's not talking to you. So you keep in touch like this. Welcome to La La Land. You're not going to find what you like. Remember that guy who she said was only a friend? Remember that girl who he thought was annoying? Yeah, they're partying 24/7 together. He/She looks happier and prettier, more handsome, sexier than Brad Pitt/Sofia Vergara and you're going to just end up thinking, that's it, Times new Roman is more dignified. Hmm.  

Then you finally decide to try this thing called No Contact
  
So then you put on whatever skin cream and spf 500 or whatever that is and go full NC. Looks like these tools knew what they were talking about.  A week goes by, all those fucks you were not giving are back.

Then you decide to go NC even harder.  You don't hear from them either. You're doing fine. Almost. You don't obsess or think about them that much and then again

Now you are well and truly fucked. Believe me. You are. No. You're not special you jackass. You are fucked. Accept it.  Everything you do,

Then you realise, science bitch.

At this point, not being able to run, back ache, it's not worth it.  And you tell the monkey to shoo the fuck off. So, the monkey is gone and all's good right?  

Wrong!  it's a monkey for christ's sake.  If it were smart enough

So then, guard up bitches or you're going to have to carry that monkey again.  And it's not a one trick pony.  You'll have to try newer and better tricks to get rid of it next time.  It ain't falling for the same old sticks and stones.  So you're better off not letting it get the better of you.  

So there you are and the monkey has now finally given up and finally you're ready to run and sleep and do whatever you want.  

I don't know what you're going to end up doing after this

Like I said

Peace and cheers all around.

My last relationship lasted *only a month* and it took me a year to get over it but to anyone struggling with getting over a relationship here's what I learnt that helps.

1. Talk about it. Seriously. Even if it means writing it in a journal.
I have a notepad application on my laptop that I journal in pretty much everyday and I write everything: my feelings, promises that were broken, etc.
Writing it down and seeing it on something physical makes the brain feel as though it no longer needs to store it in memory. It also helped tonnes with procressing what I was actually feeling.
1. Read through it. Once a month (ideally i should've done it probably once a week) I would read through everything I wrote and sort of see how my feelings progressed. I guess doing that made me realise this is a process. A long one. A very long one lol (being a year) but it helped.
1. Don't stay in contact. 
This is controversial, made me realise they weren't coming back and after a while... That was okay.
1. I bumped into her a few times and everytime I did, nothing like the grand gesture reunion I imagined"". I think the shattering of that hope kinda helped me with moving on. And every time I would realise she wasn't as amazing as I had made her out to be. (This was a very important lesson to learn.)
1.  Everytime I felt like the pain from missing her was crippling, plans. And those plans have been scrapped but that's okay, I still have the rest of my life to live and I may not know what I want now, but I will figure it out soon enough. Also, the fresh air and the feeling of improving my fitness made me hopeful about the future. I don't really know why, it just did. Ha.
1. I forgave myself for everything I thought I did wrong. In my journal, I apologised for. I put it down to being inexperienced with relationships and I wrote a little note at the bottom saying next time (without specifying the next time would be with her) that I would try to see things from the other person's point of view and not be so defensive. This helped me realise that relationships are a lot of work and just with anything in life, you have to practice it if you want to get better. I'm not perfect, and that's okay. I'm learning and willing to accept I was wrong sometimes. **It's really important to be open to learning.** Oh and also, after doing this, I realised that this literally is the best I could've done, apologising and accepting my share of the blame. If I could do this, then fuck her. I did all I could
1. I binged on break up stories on /r/breakups. I think this was the biggest help. Reading through other break up stories made me realise that I wasn't alone in feeling this shit and actually
1. I stayed away from other people and hookups during my healing process. I literally haven't had sex in over a year now. And I don't mind because looking back
1. I created a playlist of all the most depressing love songs ever. And I would let them make me feel completely and utterly weak. Sometimes I would cry along to them. After a while it became a habit, what should I do to fix this, thinking about my ex, reminiscing about the times we had, in general being pathetic and reaching out to people who would inevitably let me down... I would just turn on the playlist, be depressed for like an hour, then get on with the rest of my day. (Sidenote: Lana Del Rey - Without You is now the most played song on my playlist ha.)
1. I learnt that relationships are between **two separate individuals**. I can't control what the other person does and I can't make them want what I want. If they don't want this relationship
1. Finally

I know that this is a really long message but I hope that some of it will be of help to some people. Break ups are hard, you just have to want to first.

I don't pretend to understand everything that happened. I never will. I also don't pretend that it's not painful for me...it is...very. And I have a long road ahead of me to work on myself. 

What I DO know is that we met for a reason, but I know in time it will become more clear.

I was broken up with (22m) by my ex (21f) at the beginning of December, not as a partner. I was told that in the last 2/3 months of our relationship she had been looking at me more and more as a friend and the spark for her had died. For the first month or so I did everything that everyone here will tell you not to do. I text her and called her. I begged her to see me. I got angry with her. I asked for my stuff back. I even asked her mother who I was very close to to help me. Nothing worked. She was cold and unresponsive to me and told me she had moved on and I should do. In my head I couldn't figure out how this person who had been so good to me, so loving and caring, could go from thinking so much of me to not thinking of me at all. This person who was my best friend and my lover, who I honestly wanted to spend all my time with, could just disappear. She started seeing the new guy a week or so after we had broken up. It killed me. This guy who had been completely out of her life for near enough a year was back in her life. I remember still being her friend on Facebook and seeing him getting added to her page. It was hard. It was really hard to deal with.

Towards the end of January I came to the realisation that the person that I wanted to have a relationship with and spend all my time with didn't want to have that with me anymore. It was hard to actually tell myself that and let it go, but I miss her too. I miss the effortless conversation and how easy our relationship was. The simple things in our routine which was effortless but so enjoyable. Catching up on episodes of 'The Walking Dead' and taking drives home in the car. The way she would laugh and the dimples in her cheeks when she smiled. I could fill pages of what I miss about my best friend and the relationship, but I already have in my journal. Despite the shitty breakup and feeling replaced almost immediately by someone else, I really miss the person that I knew and treasured. It's super hard coming to terms with not having that person in my life anymore. It has been three months and there are days where I forget that we've broken up and I click my phone on and expect your text but it's not there. I look at how good we were and the little problems we had and I just view it all as such a shame that we didn't communicate what few issues we had. We've said our goodbyes to one another and it is hard letting go of you and what you meant to me. I know you'll never be part of my life again and it's upsetting but it is the only way it can be.

Trying to forget someone you love is like trying to remember someone you never knew. That's the reality of this. I can't forget you. I try to. I try to forget you ever existed and pretend I don't miss you. I try to focus on how horrific this breakup left me feeling and how low it got me. I do think about that, I'd just like to speak to you like we'd speak six months ago. Each day is hard. It's the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I can't lie and say I've had a day go by since the breakup go by in which I haven't thought about you. We made a promise to never become strangers in one another's lives. I know that won't happen to me because you were the person I knew so well.

For everyone else going through a breakup, if I did this, then we'd still be together'. I'll never know if I did do those things then maybe it could be different but you can't live your life on what ifs, you'll drive yourself mad. I couldn't understand what more I could have done to be a better boyfriend. I didn't know what this guy who hadn't been in her life for a year or so offered her that I couldn't. I never will know, we have said our goodbyes and she has moved on. I know in my heart that I was honest and loyal and I truly loved that person as much as I could. Making them happy made me happy and in that selfless act I enjoyed being me. I'll enjoy being me on my own again at some point, I know I was capable of being happy on my own before my relationship, because I was! If you had a long-term relationship with someone, but you'll make another one eventually. Just hold on out through that ride and try to be happy with yourself.

This post has been a bit of a mess in the format and how it has panned out but I just wanted to get some thoughts out, and if they're not coping, that people can help them. Hold tight everyone, peace.",,False,,False,t3_1a0qot

#1- Stay Busy- Idle time is the most dangerous.  Whatever you do, whatever, concentrate on doing it the best you can.  Take extra shifts, study groups, etc.  Take up a hobby.  Be productive and creative.  Don't get stuck with nothing to do.  This can mitigate the initial shock and get you through the first days or weeks until you can slow down and think a little clearer.  Sometimes one's best work can be completed under severe duress.  

#2- Stay Healthy- I know it's absolutely impossible to eat or sleep normally, get active.  It can be tough to start, but soon you'll be able to turn your pain into motivation.  This can be a huge building block in what seems like the arduous task feeling good about yourself again.  

#3- Keep your pride intact- Though you're emotional, have the self-respect to accept the situation and move your focus immediately to yourself.  Get a haircut, stay clean and groomed.  Buy yourself a nice jacket or pair of jeans.  While you may feel like death on the inside, keeping up with the way you present yourself to the world can again be a small step in building back your self esteem.  

#4- Clean house- Take down the pictures, but it's essential to do as soon as you're able.  Save what you may want to do decide on later down the line, but at least get it out of your everyday field of vision.  Clean your phone and computer pics out, take an afternoon to clean up your Facebook.  If it's absolutely too painful, do a full backup then just delete all your pics so you can start over and go back and sort them later when you're more able to handle it.  Whatever you do, DON'T CREEP OR STALK ONLINE.  It only hurts you.  She'll never know, never care, just lay off the social media for a while.  It is possible.  Trust me on this one.  

#5- Fake it 'til you make it- It sounds so cliche, your pain is real, but it can always help to see how it relates to your role in the world at large.  Don't be negative just because it's easy, accept the challenge to smile and project warmth at a single stranger and see where it can go from there.

It's quite depressing but truthful, they no longer feel the need to request or post for support, leaving the subreddit with nothing but sad stories.


I am in my mid twenties, hard. It's a two step process, and I want to help you all. This is all advice you've most likely heard, but please let me break it down from another perspective.

The two step process

1)The emotional wounds : The utter chaos of emotions that flutter through your mind as your ""heart"" is denying the acceptance of what's happened.

2) The ego bruise : Denying the fact that there are/were personality traits and flaws in your being that you can either choose to fix
Most people, and bury 1 deep down. This isn't advised, the emotional wound WILL pop it's ugly head eventually, I promise. No rebound, no other fill can fix this void.
The two step healing process.

1) Take the time to mourn. Cry, old pictures, looking at old love letters). Once you're done mourning, throw the shit away, it's meaningless now.

2) The fun part -rebuilding yourself. There are so many people in the world who ask ""Who am I? What am I about? What are my intuitions?"" These are all common questions everyone asks

**“It is what a man thinks of himself that really determines his fate.”** -Henry David Thoreau

To forget and dismiss the time you spent with someone is foolish. Use it to your advantage. Remember and smile. Have no regrets.

1362007277.0,19cxv8,The story of how I found myself the last 3 years,Pihlbaoge,51,6,11,"This is a long story

To start, she was moving in with me. We had been together for 3,5 years by now, and I felt things were going great. 

When we first met, she got into the university in the city where I lived, and we decided to move in together. Things were going great, at least I thought they were. She didn't know many people here, so I tried my best to bring her with me, let her meet new people, but I will admit I was relieved when she started her first year at the university and started making her own friends. I even encouraged her to be there more than she was, and my job was paying for this really useful course

After some time I felt we weren't seeing each other as much as I would have liked, fair enough I thought to myself, and hung out with my friends instead. One day, right before I am going away, she asks me if she can borrow my car while I'm away. She and this guy Eric from her university have been tasked to buy beer and whine for the next party, and in Sweden (for some stupid reason) you are only allowed to by alcohol in special stores, sparsely placed in the city. No problems with me

When I get back the apartment is a mess. I can tell that clearly someone has been there, that was fine by me. She tells me that this guy Eric, her friend Anna and her Boyfriend had been over one night. She says that she felt bad about bringing people over to my place when I am away, but I try to tell her that it's OUR place now. 

A few weeks pass

And then my girlfriend drops the bomb on me. She felt the same way about us. She says that she will start looking for a place of her own tomorrow. The next day she comes back from school and tells me she found an apartment. I found this very odd, and that this gave her the apartment. I remember that I had also been in line for a rental apartment for many years, even though I bought one when got my job. So I believe her. 

We keep seeing each other for some time, maybe that's even for the best right now. But I can't not be her boyfriend, and still see her, knowing that she might just as well see someone else when I'm not around. 

She tells me that's not going to happen

So we go our separate ways. 

A few weeks later

I cannot begin to explain how devastated I was. I would have done pretty much anything for her, and had him over for dinner when I was away. I was just too stupid/blind/trusting to realize what was actually going on. 

The following 6 months were a haze. I spent more time drunk than I should have (not in any way so that it became a problem

When summer came I was still devastated. Some friends managed to talk me into going to berlin with them

But then. Nearly a year after we had broken up, with an amazing smile. She could quote all scenes from Pulp Fiction, while my ex girlfriend just thought that Pult Fiction was needlessly violent. This woman was the first person who managed to actually make me happy since my ex girlfriend moved out. I was pretty much in love again. 

After seeing her a few times, and that while she liked me, she would probably not date me anytime soon. 

Well, and in a nice way too. 

But this was when I realized that this girl had many qualities that I wanted in a future girlfriend. Many of which my ex girlfriend didn't have. 

And then I meet yet another friend of a friend

And I start looking at people in another way. Instead of comparing them to my ex girlfriend (who had been idolized by me the last year) I start thinking about good traits. And I start compiling them. And I realize that many of them had one trait, which I hadn't done in years. 

I started traveling. I went to Kenya, France, Germany and many more places. I even started wokring out again. And not to look good, but because I thought it was fun to go with new friends. 

And then it dawned upon me, deep down inside of a vary black hole. And that person she left down there would never be able to get up. The only way for me to get back up was to become someone new. Someone better. 

And I was better. I had more friends than ever before. People found me to be a very friendly and kind person in touch with himself and his feelings. 

And now i stand here, because the person I was was really crappy standing next to the person I had become. 

Still

Until a few days ago.

A ran into her. She looked kind of sad. And weary. And a lot fatter actually. Her face looked tired and her clothes were worn. I didn't talk to her

And I pitied her. And deep down inside, I found it very ironic that last time we spoke I was on the lowest point of my life, all thanks to her, and her shitty way of breaking up, and now I am at the highest, and she seem to have been going only downhill ever since. 


Well... It may be a stupid story

Or as I like to say. Experience is damn tedious to get

And today I am pretty damn glad she did what she did. It broke me. It forced me to start over. If forced me to become what I am today.

1344379358.0,xujyh,Surviving a breakup,roxyfirestorm,49,5,11,"This friday makes it nine weeks. Weeks. It's like counting a baby's age in months after the first year. Reverse math

You know the story. You met, an ideal romance. Friends look on in envy and say how good you are together. You smile to yourself when you think about them. Some days you just miss them so much you feel like your heart might explode before you get to tell them, and they're only sat across the room from you. The touch, the smell, the warmth of their arms. Perfect.

All relationships end. Every single one. Some get the timing right

But usually something dies.

Sometimes the love

I've said this before, ever getting the guy. Make them regret having ever let you go, by becoming amazing. If you ever have to cross paths, make sure you look stunning. Make them drool, make then crawl, and make them wish they'd never let you go. You'll feel better about yourself, and in the end you'll realise that you deserved better.
""I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself""

I have lived through the demise of seven relationships. Seven men I have dated have caused my life to come to a crashing halt. 

The first was a jerk. Sometimes I look back and think how I almost married him. Other times I remember how he stayed out all night so I poured his beer down the sink. 

2 years

The second was a jerk. I spent the best part of a week and the last of my wages texting him lyrics to November Rain. He lived with his ex

3 months

The third? A jerk. So fond of his weed and red bull he couldn't get it up. He used to do donuts in the car park outside my work and get me in trouble with the managers. Due to a conflict at home I moved in. Lived out of his bedroom. Told his mum about how he'd proposed to me on the first date. Suddenly it was time to move out again. 

6 months

You know where this is going now. Four and five were close together, hide from the world. Like being hugged by a tree. 

3months

I cried when Five would bring me home. Insecure me felt he'd go and never come back

5 months

That brings us to Six. He was a stupid jerk. I tied his foot to the bed and then mercilessly tickled it until he cried for help. He brought candles into the bedroom and left me with miniature burns all over my skin. Hiatus whilst he spent a year in canada. He came back in no time at all after falling in love with the girl who would sleep with all of canada but not him.

4 months

Number seven. 



1 year

They all have two things in common now. They are all past tense, completely and forever. They were perfect, once, and in time they became human again. 

It's easy to forget the bad times, but only if you're prepared to make footprints. Whoever they were and however long you were together, they did, at the very least once, act like a jerk. You did too, nobody's perfect. They see you as you should see them, flaws and all. 


Two steps to self preservation. Make yourself awesome, dress as if you might. No hanging your head and crying. Hold your head up high, and if you need to, believe that it's the best way to get them back. Show them what they let go of. Make them regret ever letting go of you and force them to observe as you glide with supreme awesomeness. 


And the being human part. That's the most important thing you can do to survive. Every time you get misty thinking back with those rose coloured glasses, paint a picture. It doesn't matter how you do it, just remember that they are not perfect. Make a list. Use it to build your defences around your heart. Protect yourself from the hurt that once was there. In time the hurt will fade, and you won't need to remember the reasons any more. But never forget. At least once, they were a jerk.",,False,t5_2ra79,True

This community was a great help to me in getting over him.

Hey A.

The funny thing about what's happening right now is that it's exactly what I wanted. In my depression after you dumped me, to feel the pain of unrequited feelings. 

Most of all

But now that it's actually happening (to a somewhat less extreme degree), and pissed off at what you've put me through.

When you tell me now that you ""know how I felt"" back then

I should've seen this coming, every knife in my chest.

You told me that I didn't go out enough, at least in part due to the way you treated me. And your reaction to my sadness was to criticize me for the very things I was trying to change in my life. Instead of supporting me and helping me move forward, you got angry at me and made me feel a hundred times worse.

And now you've seen where I've gotten. New job, new life. Pursuing my goals with all I've got. Feeling wonderful and living life to the fullest. Dating a new guy, but keeping it fun and casual, avoiding the mistake we made of getting too serious too soon. I created this situation for myself out of utter desperation, trying to climb out of the pit you threw me down. I guess I can't be mad -- why wouldn't you want me back? I've proven you wrong on all fronts. But I can't be with someone whose love is conditional, someone who only wants me when I'm on top of life. Because I know there will be times when I'm sad again, times when I'll look to others to help dig me out

Honestly, I can catalyze a positive change in your life as well.

**Delete them from any social media:** 
That means Facebook, but that wasn't enough for me. I still went on her page, and I'd go on her friends page where I'd see pictures of her smiling, drinking, partying, and having a good time. This just enhanced my misery, and really hurt my recovery. You may tell yourself,"" or ""I just won't look at her profile."" If that's the case, but maybe block them from your news feed as well so that if you do see them or talk to them

**Hit the gym:** 
This is what you'll read on countless other threads, or she was on my mind I'd throw on some headphones and go for a bicycle ride. This helped tremendously by taking my mind off of her, and giving me something to do.

**Friends and family:**
Friends and family can be the glue that hold you together if you let them. Some of you may not have any friends in town that you can go to, then turn to /r/breakups. We are a family because we are all in this together.

**Anti-depressants/Therapy**
Anti-depressants were made for a reason, and to improve. 

**The next one will be better:**
This is what a few of my friends have told me. It's easy to think that you've found the one, you'll never be able to move forward into the future. You deserve to be loved, and you'll find someone who loves you and treats you the way you deserve to be treated in the future. 

**/r/breakups won't answer everything:**
Don't get me wrong, intelligent, and honest people out there. We're all going through the same thing, and it helps being able to talk to who can empathize with you. That being said, even if you read all of /r/breakups, you won't find some overreaching truth, or the answers for why your relationship has ended. There are a myriad number of reasons why relationships don't work

**Take up a hobby/job:**
It's easy to become paralyzed and not move forward. Dwelling and sitting in your room won't help you to become a better person, maybe put more effort into work if you haven't been. Doing a goof job at something is satisfying, and it will help you to realize that you are a strong person, and that you can accomplish anything with the right attitude and effort. 

**No contact:**
There aren't one more amount of words, but it doesn't truly exist. We just have to push some things out of our mind, and turn them into memories. You may think you're doing great after a few weeks of not talking to them, but I hadn't talked to her in quite a while and just seeing her text and responding really threw me for a loop. If you need to rant or someone to talk to, come to /r/breakups. We're here, and we support you.

Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy. If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve

If you feel like he is stringing you along, or is in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less. Never let a man define who you are. Never borrow someone else's man. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.

A man will only treat you the way you allow him to treat you. All men are not dogs. You should not be the only one doing allthe bending.. compromise is a two way street. You need time to heal between relationships.. there is nothing cute about baggage.

Deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship. You should never look for someone to complete you.. a relationship consists of two whole individuals. Look forsomeone complimentary, never co-sign for a man. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything you need. Keep him in your radar but get to know others.

I browsed /breakups

DO NOT do the following:

1.  Have unnecessary contact with your ex.  Seriously.  Looking back, that I could never live life without her.  We went so far as to continue a sexual relationship - after each contact, I was back at square 1.  Point is, no matter how insanely hard it might seem, if you truly want the pain to end as quickly as possible, cease all contact.  

2.  Hit the bottle.  I did this.  Hard.  It doesn't help anything

3.  Fail to eat.  Some of us lose our appetite upon having our worlds turned upside down.  I lost 40 lbs in three months.  Treat your body right, anything.  I found myself almost completely drained from day to day, unable to do much of anything, simply because I was literally starving.  Lying in bed and having nothing to do except ruminate about my ex was about as helpful as getting my face stuck in a bear trap.

4.  Rebound.  I tried everything to take my mind off my ex.  I decided to utilize the ""fuck everything that moves"" strategy to help boost my self esteem and to give me something else to concentrate on.  In my case, I rather was.  I hurt people, and rationalized it as a necessary survival strategy.  Take time to yourself.  Figure out what makes you happy, without your ex.  Things I greatly enjoyed got lost simply because of my association with her, but in retrospect the human capacity for enjoyment is enormous.  You can and will find things you truly love that you don't associate with your ex.  

5.  Blame yourself.  This might be the most important thing.  Try as hard as you can to avoid blaming yourself, understand that it is over, and that the reasons behind it are not important to your recovery.  Don't spend sleepless nights wondering how you messed up.  

6.  Don't dwell on the good times.  The little secrets, and that you will build memories with them just as easily as you did with your ex.  Knock them off that goddamned pedestal, because it's neither real nor unique.  I refused to believe this at first and looking back, I sincerely wish I'd have tried so much harder to focus on the things that I knew were wrong, rather than the golden moments that every single couple shares.  

I hope this helps.  The advice on this subreddit is golden.  Listen to it.  Don't do what I did and ignore the collected experiences of many, you will come to a better place so much faster than you would otherwise.  Hang in there, be strong, and listen to what others have to say.

""The best things to ever happen to me were once the worst things to ever happen to me.""

This is for all of you who have an ex who rebounded after the relationship :)

Hello.  I used to be a frequent visitor of this subreddit months ago, and it hurt like crazy to think it was more my fault than I ever thought.

That happened last August 31

Eventually I stopped trying to talk to her, even as she was 3 or 4 months into this new relationship.  That prolonged my suffering greatly.

Now I'm mostly over it.  I still think of her every day, and dating is waay better than it used to be, with my new-found wisdom :).

And today she texted me.

She told me about the things I did in the weeks before she left that she didn't like, and she responded ""I was upset and I knew you didn't know why...  u deserve to know and I don't want you to do it again.""

r/breakups, and happier than ever.  I analyzed the shit out of everything in our relationship for months.  I realized what I had done and how it must have made her feel, and I felt bad, but then I got over it.

This girl, has obviously NOT thought about the things that happened.  She always wanted a relationship.. was always desperate for it.  And since she found someone new to distract her instead of getting over it, she has not analyzed what her mistakes were (a breakup is never 100% on one person, and most of our mutual friends say she did more bad than I did.. the girl had a boyfriend in another city for part of the time we were dating for fuck's sake!!).

She rebounded, and I'm happier than ever.

So, but I wouldn't trade this wisdom for anything.

*Time can never mend*

*Pain is all you'll find*

Letting go of a partner is hard, can attest to that being true. There is nothing worth knowing about what your ex is up to at this point, and it's better to stay ignorant than be constantly checking what they are doing or who they are with. I personally made myself suffer by always reading up on my ex's social media and had a front row seat to the start of her new relationship. That shit blew, so do yourself a favor and block them/stay away from them on social media. You never know what you'll find, and it's better that you just stay in the dark.

When the time came to break up, I was devastated, and I realized I had been neglecting other parts of my life, including meeting new friends and improving myself.

So, and getting too involved too fast because it feels good.

My message to you is this: you will feel bad for a good long time because you lost a best friend and a lover

What you need to realize is that you are free now, and you can go and meet plenty of other people and love them.

**Always remember this: you are free now**

**Edit:** I'm glad so many of you found my early morning drunken words inspirational, things will get better.

1367590148.0,1dmawg,"How to escape the memories that constantly haunt us, (or at least learn to live with them) PLEASE READ",Dranoelalex,51,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dmawg/how_to_escape_the_memories_that_constantly_haunt/, I want what we all really want; for things to go back to the way they were. I wanted to be with her again, knowing things won't ever be fixed and knowing I don't love her I still miss those moments. 

Hense why I'm making this post redditors, being out of the relationship, knowing I don't love her I can't free my mind from these happy memories and can't help but miss them. I originally asked my self if there was any way to escape these memories, I remember seeing an episode of Doctor Who where in the future they sell a way to erase portions of your memory. Then I asked myself if I would want every memory of my ex erased. To which I arrived at an obvious ""no"". 

Thinking further into the idea, no matter how many posts on this subreddit you read, no matter how many friends you talk to or how much you look for an answer else where, it has to come internally. Time, acceptance and change will save you from these painful thoughts.

Time - You've seen the word a thousand times, 1 month deep and think ""FUCK that! I'm in so much pain and not ready to go through 4 months more of this shit"". I've been there, all I can say is it will take time, yes, but don't fear the amount of time still left. This is the hardest part to really accept because there isn't really anything to accept, we have no control over it. Time is just something you can't think about, don't focus on how long it will take you tell your normal again, you can relate. You won't heal when you're constantly worrying about when you're going to heal

Change - Again, hang out with friends, keep your mind off her/him and try new things and you think to yourself, ""FUCK that! everytime I go out sure I don't think about my ex for a little while but when I come home or am alone I instantly think about them again, there's no way to escape my thoughts, I just postpone them. Well, I have news for you. Although you think you're just postponing the thoughts of him/her, you need to not just party and keep your mind off your ex but realize that LIFE is FUN without them in it. You can live again, change how you feel and think because change is essential for either getting over your ex or growing as a person so maybe they might love you again. You also need to realize that it's not just you that's changing

Acceptance - This is the hardest step yet the most important (a step I myself have yet to conquer). When you can accept that you're alright without the only light in your life, it also helps you come to terms with your breakup, for better or for worse. We ALWAYS find it so hard to accept though, we want to fight for our ex, we want them back! Acceptance is important because it gives you the time to really reflect on whether YOU want to get back with him/her. When you've finally come to accept your choice then you'll mind will be at peace and the healing will be almost done. Most importantly, accept the memories of your ex, don't dwell over them

Now as a little thought experiment, now think about how much time has passed since then, years, decades, months. Time heals all wounds. Think about change, surely we've all changed so much from grade 9, now just think about in a few years when you look back and you'll realize how much you've changed since now. Finally think about acceptance, there will come a point when you'll give 0 fucks about your most recent heartbreak

Finally

Enjoy life redditors! Peace.

1371010679.0,1g6biy,Why You Should Learn to Walk Away,ohschit,47,10,14,"*A friend of mine recently sent me this article

I’ve made many romantic connections with women. I’ve also lost many of those connections. I’ve met girls who weren’t into me sexually and gotten rejected in various ways. I’ve even had a date ask me if it was cool to get another guy’s number while we were out for drinks.

All of these experiences have helped me grow. But almost nothing has contributed to my self-esteem and success like the times where I was the one who walked away from girls that I knew weren’t right. Think about this for a second…

When’s the last time you chose to willingly end a connection with a girl you were attracted to?

For most


Needless Pride and the Win-Lose Mindset: Scarcity Mentality
Many men have fragile egos when it comes to women. I’m not judging

Scarcity mentality is the belief that there’s a limited number of opportunities in your life. With women

“If I don’t get this girl

You then do everything in your power to “win” girls over. You will chase endlessly, and even let yourself get walked over — all because you can’t let go of this one girl.

This is a needy

* I have no standards for myself and the women who are a part of my life. I will take whatever I can get whether or not they are right for me.
* I have no options for women. I have to latch onto every chance I get because I am not good enough to find someone else. Women who like me are rare.
* My self-worth is tied to my ability to attract women and their approval of me.
* I think of women as objects to be acquired. Their personalities
* This scarcity mentality leaves you unfulfilled and destroys your self-esteem. Instead
* 
Setting Standards and Respecting Your Worth: Abundance Mentality
Abundance mentality is the belief that you have plenty of opportunities in your life. More so

This is not something most people are born with but rather cultivated. It begins with how you respect and value yourself.

Repeat after me: “I am worthy of…”

* Having my time respected.
* Having my needs met.
* Being treated fairly.
* Connecting with people who improve the quality of my life.
* Meeting women who are willing to invest back in me.
* You have to set standards and want more for yourself. And not just more

Is she putting effort into building a connection (sexual included) with me? Is she valuing my time? Is this fulfilling my needs and wants? Am I chasing something that isn’t going anywhere? Am I clinging onto this woman only because I’m afraid of being alone and having to put myself out there again?

Often when a guy comes to me frustrated with a specific girl

The abundance mentality prioritizes yourself. It leads to fulfillment and a strong level of self-esteem.

Developing the Abundance Mentality By Living It
Okay

You have to move on from those who don’t meet your standards. You have to stop wasting time on people who don’t invest in you and spend time on people who do. And you have to consciously remind yourself that there are an infinite number of women available to you and seek them out.

Here are some romantic situations in which you can apply this:

* A girl you met disrespects your friends in front of you.
* You meet a girl and she doesn’t open up to you after 5-10 minutes. That means she isn’t asking you questions
* You approach a girl and she rejects you.
* You confirm a date with a girl 24-48 hours before you meet. She stands you up with no  warning.
* You text a number twice and get no response.
* You keep texting a girl to make plans and she never actually hangs out.
* You wait around for a girl who has said she only sees you as a friend or that she’s not looking for something right now.
* A girl with a boyfriend flirts with you often but never spends time with you in person or moves it forward. She claims she’s miserable in her relationship and promises she wants to be with you but doesn’t break up with him.
* You’re in a relationship with an abusive or controlling partner.
* You’re in a relationship that makes you miserable or unsatisfied (emotionally or sexually).
* Your girlfriend breaks up or cheats on you. (I understand this one is extremely difficult but necessary.)
* You have a complete mismatch of expectations that cannot be resolved: you want an open relationship and she doesn’t
* Instead of sticking around, or getting down on yourself — you must keep pushing forward.

That means not giving her ultimatums. Or begging for her to take you back. Or flipping out on her and sitting around seething with rage. Or resenting all women. Or beating yourself up. Or using those standards as a defense mechanism to avoid meeting more girls.

A man with abundance does not waste his energy when he can use it to further improve his own life. He simply says

By doing the above you’ll meet tons of great women, and forge stronger connections. Most importantly, you’ll value yourself and build genuine confidence.

Men with abundance are willing to lose the wrong girl to find the right one. They know that having the courage to walk away comes from a place of power,,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,True

Short recap: Me 34M, married 8 months.  Relationship broke down for a number of reasons, trust issues, sexual dysfunction and emotional cheating.  She's been leaving me slowly now for about 2 months I guess, but she moved out of my house almost 5 weeks ago.

Anyway I just want to say you WILL feel so much better in time.  This relationship was my whole universe.  This woman was everything to me.  I'd been in love with her give or take for 15 years.  The thought of an existence without her wasn't even a possibility.  She was my lover

I couldn't function on any kind of level.  At work I'd burst into tears at my desk and have to run off to my car so my co-workers couldn't see me.  So I took a week and a half off, emotions, frantic emails and thoughts.  I was just so crushed.  I had that burning aching feeling I'm sure someone out there right now has..  like your chest is on fire, like you've had a hole kicked right through you.  There's no escaping it, it's all you can think of - it is your every thought from waking to crawling into bed to ""sleep"" .. which is a joke because all you do is think and cry and stay awake all night.  Or if you fall asleep you wake up in a sweat at 3am thinking of it all.. and you can't get back to  sleep.  Then you think about calling them..  or texting them or emailing them.  Maybe you follow through, and then when they don't give you the response you want, you feel worse.  

Maybe you think about hurting yourself.  You know

Sorry for rambling.. I got on kind of a roll there.  Anyway I hope my words show how badly off I was just *2 weeks ago*.  Honestly at one point I was close to checking myself in to some sort of mental care facility.

So what's changed?  Everything.  I've immersed myself in new and old friends. I've reconnected with some old friends I've had minimal contact with for a while now.  People I neglected because of my marriage.  People I will NOT be neglecting anymore.  Because when the chips were down these people were there for me in ways I never expected.

I made new friends.  Most of them from this subreddit.  I've emailed people

All this has reminded me that I'm an awesome person without my relationship.  Hell..  I think I'm a better person without my dysfunctional relationship.  The old me is back.. the one who has a wry smile and a zest for life.

I woke up today with a smile on my face.  I was halfway to work before I realised..   ""oh yeah..  my wife left me"".  And the smile didn't fade.  I have a whole new life to consider.  I can take any path from here, I can see now that I can make a better life for myself without her.  Bitch did me a favour by leaving.

So please...  hang in there if you're hurting.   It does get better.  Connect with friends old and new.  Keep yourself distracted.  Exercise, cook something delicious.

And if like me you've been fucked over - realise you're an awesome person who deserves better than whatever your ex has done to you.  They're the one's missing out.  You have the strength to do this inside you.  Just take it one day

Happy to answer any questions anyone might have - I hope this gives someone out there hope..  I hope to give someone out there a light in the darkness the way others from here have done for me.

I met her three years ago. She was out of my league in every way, foolish and unprepared, and she's a shy but perfect companion, savvy and good at planning. She's daring and ballsy and excited by new experiences, she just lets others lead the experience.

All of my friends liked her - some thought she was a little boring, who loves to hike in the wilderness - a girl who climbed onto the back of my motorcycle and carved around the mountains with me. She has taken many more leaps of faith than I ever could, really, and I never opened my eyes to see them.

More importantly, but I didn't act the part. I was terrified.

She always wanted what was best for me. Could I do that for her? Could I give up my dreams, the generosity of spirit, to give that up to be with this wonderful, caring, beautiful woman?

I didn't.

And, I took our relationship for granted. I treated her like she didn't have the choice to leave. I cheated on her, and found things about her to criticize. I was demanding of her while acting selfishly myself. And somehow, somehow she put up with it for years - every day though, my behavior eroded her love. Every day there was a little bit less between us. And then one day, she didn't love me anymore.

Now, few worries, fantastic friends and family. I will live, and she will live, and maybe we'll both find something near as good.

But I'll always remember the woman who taught me what love is: tipping the scales in the other person's favor. Playing to lose. Weighing everything and determining that a life, but without Amy, it feels less than half complete.

In everything I do, because we always fit together perfectly. When I visit new places, I notice all the things that she would like. Good books remind me of how we used to sit up in bed at night and read to one another. I can't cook the bachelor's meals she used to enjoy anymore. The funny shows we watched together aren't as funny anymore. When another woman sleeps with me on the bed we chose together, I feel like I'm living another, sadder man's life.

And the best part? I really don't think I want to be with anyone for a while. I just want to focus on me and my happiness. And that should be enough. I think it finally is. I'm spending time with myself and doing things on my own. I'm getting to know who I am and to be honest

So in the end... it gets better. And it's really hard to see that early on but I promise you

1354218100.0,140cdx,Trying to give back: 24F's tips for soul destroying heartache,missbedwell,44,3,28,"So I came to this board a while ago asking whether or not you could ever heal the pain from losing the love of your life. Since then

This has no doubt be posted before

*My ex (33M) strung me along for months with the hope of reconciliation. DO NOT DO THIS. Either you're together

*Do read ""he's just not that into you"" (even if you're a guy)

*Don't be scared to get help. Your pain is real. It's a loss and you are grieving. In some ways it's worse than a death because there is no certain closure. Even one session with a professional can help. I did cognitive behavioural therapy.

*No contact is key. Everyone knows this

*I watched every episode of Community all over again. It helped. Try it.

*BELIEVE people when they say it'll get better/they have been through the same thing.

*I'm an atheist and found comfort in this: http://www.katsandogz.com/onjoy.html

*If you think you're depressed

*Write down all the positives and negatives of your last relationship in two separate columns. Try to do it when you're in a relatively stable place

*Here's the kicker; you won't find someone who ticks every positive quality on that list.

My list of ""pros"" was ridiculous for my ex

That weekend I met a guy who blew my mind. We talked for 8 hours straight at a party. The mental list of ""pros"" from my ex had to be thrown out because it was specific to him; this new guy came with his own unique set of positive attributes that I'd never even considered before; I couldn't have even have dreamt him up.

I'm not saying someone else will help heal all the heartache but he's proven to me that you don't need to find a ""replacement"", vacation, hobby.. anything.

How it made me **BETTER**

* ""Clean Slate"" policy (no drugs

2. Put anything that reminds you of them away in a box and put it out of sight. Even if it was yours before you met them and it reminds you of them put it away!

3. Do something you have never done before. I did a crossfit intro class. It was insane

4. Don't contact them! Seriously. NC is the way to go. I hate to say it but time does heal the pain, but you HAVE to accept that or you will not move forward.

5. Go on vacation if you can afford it. One of the reasons I'm so glad my ex broke up with me is because I would have never thought to go on vacation. Even if I would have thought to go on vacation

6. Go talk to someone if needed. If it's a therapist or a friend

7. The only way you will know if you are ready to talk to them again is if you think about them with someone else. Think about them traveling with someone else, talk to them if you want, but if they start hitting on you or flirting, they COULD (not positively) be messing with your heart. So watch out for red flags. Couples hardly ever break up and get back together. I'm not saying it never happens but it's rare. 

8. Be kind to yourself. Don't starve yourself, really make sure where you are in life is where you want to be, and if it is, then make it even better! ",,False,,False,t3_17ywme

She would constantly talk about her co-worker and when he started calling her and texting I knew things weren't right. The other night I went through her phone and saw that they were texting each other back and forth and one of the last messages was her saying to him that she's moving out in a few months which was something she had never said to me. I immediately called her out on it which turned into a big fight.
She said nothing sexual ever happened even though some of the texts were sexual. They apparently have developed strong feelings for each other over the past few months. Her co-worker is married and his wife just recently got pregnant after they were trying for years. He's been telling my girlfriend how miserable his marriage is and that he's going to file for divorce which was a complete lie. The next day I found his wife's facebook and sent her a message about it. If I were in her shoes I'd want to know. Apparently he only told his wife that he had a crush on her and that was it. At no point was he ever going to come clean even after he found out yesterday from my girlfriend that I found out. After I sent the message I realized he probably had access to her FB and would delete the message to cover himself which he ended up doing.
A few hours later and with a little research I tracked down his wife's business e-mail and sent the message again just in case. According to my girlfriend his wife immediately called him and ended their relationship and told him to leave. His wife responded to my e-mail saying she's so glad I had the courage to tell her this
We talked for a while through text last night after she left and I told her about all of this and how selfish they were. She said she had no idea I was even getting a ring. Kind of hard to say to your SO oh hey I'm getting you an engagement ring. It would completely ruin the surprise. She said at this point she doesn't even know what she wants. I obviously love her but don't think there is a way to ever gain back her trust and move past this. I'm beyond hurt by all of this as I'm sure his soon to be ex-wife is.

Nearly 6 years together, he was the first man I'd had sex with. He was patient, loving, giving, and respectful. The years wore on and we began to grate against each other - our respective voices were too loud to hear each other speak. It was too much, and so I left. 

I wanted to believe that we could be friends. After all

Three months later we return from no contact, he tells me how what I did to him, well, he just couldn't sleep or eat for weeks. I apologize. I fall asleep and he lays down beside me. He puts the moves on me, and it leads to sex. He dwells on it, says it was beautiful but it shouldn't happen again. I agree whole-heartedly, say I wouldn't have, alluding to how great it was.

The next weekend he wants to hang out. Six years and now a muddled friendship, I did. We had friend fun, you know, that heavy silliness that makes you feel alive? Eating dinner, he told me he crushed on another girl. I paused, I didn't say anything--it wasn't my place, and I knew that. He asked ""why is it affecting you, and I need to just listen. 

He had sex with that girl, and he had sex with her before we had sex last weekend. He didn't think that maybe it would be important to let me know that he was sexually active before f*cking me again. All of those words about sex being connected to love, how he berated me for 'moving on' so quickly (I really hadn't, still haven't had sex with anyone else). And now, now, couldn't I see? He was over me. I left him. and now he was over me. And if I couldn't put up with four hours of him talking about relationships, then he had no obligation to be friends with me.  - his words. NOW, I have no obligation to ever speak to someone who makes me feel like shit - who presses into me with his dick and with his phallic arrogance.

I drug the breakup out to a painful degree, but nothing else, I deluded myself into thinking there was more. In reality, he did lead me on a little bit, using affectionate terms and essentially behaving as a boyfriend. Last week I finally got real closure. I got up the courage to ask him if there was any hope for us in the future, he said no. He didn't see himself ever feeling the same way again. I thought I would feel awful, but I just felt calm and satisfied with that answer. It was a huge relief. 

I haven't texted him since and feel no need to ever do so again. He's a great person and I wish the best for him

When you're in the middle of a breakup, because that person isn't significant to your life any more. Sometimes, at your saddest point, you feel like the best advice is actually the worst advice, because you're still so in love with whatever satisfaction that person gave you, momentarily. We all experience this, it's almost an obsession.

You had plans to hang out with them, and thinking about all things that could have been. All the things you could have been doing.

But wait. There's something to be learned here. Today's a day about being thankful. How about being thankful for yourself? They sat there, and taught you something. They gave you a reason to be thankful for yourself. That person is gone. It's terrible. It can't be fixed. Holidays are a time to think about the positives.

So sit down. Right now on this Thanksgiving. No excuses. Make a list of the things you're thankful for. Your parents. Your friends. Your dog/cat. Your job. Your new gym membership. All the great deals you'll get tomorrow on Black Friday. And then add to that ""I'm thankful for what I learned"".

You learned a valuable lesson about people. About relationships. Perhaps multiple lessons throughout the course of the relationship. And from that

I guarantee you this. Your ex is sitting at home right now. With their family. And you've crossed their mind multiple times. They've thought ""Wow. This holiday feels different."" Hell

In fact, your new objective is to win the breakup. Yes, I just grabbed a reference from a popular TV sitcom. Win. The. Breakup. How do you win? By changing your mindset. Improving the way you dress. Improving your fitness. Take time out to find something you enjoy doing. Music, reading, writing, exercise, or a new hobby. All of that is within your realm of control. That realm of possibility. And the possibilities are endless.

It's only natural that you replace something that's gone with something you care about more. And I'm not talking about finding a new person. Find something else to set your mind to that you care about more than the one who left you. This is where your turning point lies. This is where it gets better. This is your catalyst.

If you take this to heart

And over time, and the even better person you can become. It starts right here. This Thanksgiving, you're going to win.

**Disclaimer: long read ahead! :)**







The first few days were no less than hell. I was crushed, but all i saw were his favorite cereal, the food we loved to cook together, the deodorant he uses. Getting dressed in the morning was a chore: the tshirt I got at that concert, that dress he loved on me, etc. I took down our pictures, but seeing the empty space on the wall were our smiling happy faces used to be hurt just as bad. I missed him SO much, our life together

The days went on and slowly turned into weeks. Little by little

Got my shit together at work, have dinner, and so on. I don't always feel like it, but I make myself get out there and (sometimes pretend to) have fun. Talking to other people helps a lot, it puts things in perspective and it's nice to get compliments :)  **Even if you feel like crying in you bedroom, GO OUT. It WILL make you feel better, I promise!**



I still miss him a lot. I mourn our what-has-been and our what-could-have-been. I still cry. The bad days still outweigh the good at this point. HOWEVER I'm starting to see a tiny little spec of light at the end of the tunnel. Here's why:

- The way he went about the breakup (very childish
**I don't WANT to get back together.** I deserve someone who loves and respects me just as much as I love him.

- The issues we had were NOT going to disappear in the future. We didn't fight much, we had our differences. These were always about either his immaturity/lack of initiative or me not getting along with his parents. These things will NOT change, his parents and his personality are stable factors I CANNOT CONTROL.
**Sooner or later

- He made his choice to not choose me. HE doesn't want to be with ME. Devastating and heartbreaking as it may be

I'm not over this by long shot. This was my first serious relationship

But, single life doesn't seem all that...bad. I used to be overweight when I first started dating my now ex-bf. Since then, I lost a lot of weight and gained a lot of confidence. I get hit on quite a lot (don't mean to blow my own horn!). Maybe I should start enjoying this a little more?

How to get over him",4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yam1a/breaking_up_how_to_get_over_him/,"
Getting over him.

It will be difficult.  It will feel often like you’re moving backwards.  Do not give up.  In fact?  Give in.  Give in to those feelings.  Feel everything you’re feeling so that it can leave you.  That is the goal.

Brave faces and stiff upper lips will only get you so far, they will break, and they will give their body what it needs.  You need to do the same.  And what your body needs is to grieve.  It needs to be allowed to feel its pain in its entirety, so do not shut it down.

There may be times when your pain has to take a back seat.  I understand this.  Sometimes the job interview, but only if this is the exception, not the norm, and you allow yourself to surrender to your emotions during your necessary process of healing and self-discovery.

Be patient with you, let it go.  Do not re-think all the mistakes you made, all the mistakes he made, it is over.  Do not remember only the good.  Cherish it for what it was, but leave it in the past.

Watch your breathing; learn to return your focus to your body

Time is your new lover.  Time will let you be as sad as you want.  Time will let you pretend to be (sometimes actually be) okay and then let you come home, “I told you so.” Time will just sit with you.  Eventually, you’ll need less of it.  Eventually, you’ll feel whole again; but for now, know that you are whole.  This pain is a part of you, a part of the whole you.

Go gently.  Be kind.  Breathe in and breathe out.  This too shall pass.

However, when it comes to love

In any case, doubting everything and remaining extremely pessimistic, but I've persevered and remained positive and optimistic. I've always been a positive and happy individual, trying to make the best of every situation all for HER happiness. I always wanted to be sure that her happiness was absolute paramount to every situation, even though most of the time she was just generally unhappy and bitter for no reason at all. She continued acting this way while we've been talking again, and I knew where things were headed with how she was acting but I loved the comfort of having her around.

Last night I was hanging out with a friend, fell asleep, then woke up to her linking the breakup post and saying to leave her alone, screw off, that she isn't the one in the wrong, how  she regrets seeing me, how she can't believe I needed to seek a pity party from strangers online and how I'm pathetic for it. She even said that she is going to act like I was never a part of her life

Let us face some facts:

The fact that you're hurting this bad right now is because you feel like you've lost the ""love"" of your life. Haha, and if you don't believe that, look at your situation. You've broken up for a reason. It doesn't matter if it was you, or your ex that broke up. Fact is you've broken up, and seriously - it is time to move on.

This isn't a romantic movie starring Adam Sandler. This is real life, hurting, yet again. 

Time heals all wounds - you've heard it - and it is true. Little by little, heck, there will be a time when you'll be laughing and cringing at how patethic you acted, and you'll thank yourself for dodging a bullet, and I mean a bullet from rocket launcher friends, a huge surprising bullet. 

Although it is true that time heals all wounds - you have to capitilize it. You have to take power of the situation

Now - listen to me friends, start spending it on yourself. Remember all the things you wanted to do, but never had the time to do? Well, it's time! Keep yourself occupied, keep yourself busy, and keep yourself happy. Soon, you'll come to realize that your life didn't revolve around your ex, love yourself

Now I'm not saying there is a magic pill that'll heall your wounds. What I am saying though is that there is a time when enough is enough. You just don't want to take more pain, only you can help yourself to grow and learn from this experience. You can only move on when you first accept that it's over, accept the pain, accept the good memories, and move on. 

Remember - pain is temporarily. It might last for days, and gramatical errors, but I just realized that I've learned so much from being here, and it help'd me so much to come over my ex, that it was time to give something back to you. ",,False,t5_2ra79,True

Basically, no matter how you feel (for me...it felt as if (if you could sit and imagine with me) being stuck in a lost dimension of black void, there is no sky, there is no floor, there is just the sense of falling and despair, as if there was no end or point, just a tragic misfortune to be born alive)


Basically, here is what helped me move on quickly for the most part

- No Contact (This includes trying to find out any information on what they are up to


- Facing the reality, mistakes happen. You will feel better, time will make things better, day by day, don't dwell on the past or future, do what you can for the present to help direct you in a positive and productive path.


- Things like Soul-mate and etc,

 “We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”
I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.
Let our scars fall in love.” 
― Galway Kinnell

- Accept that things happen for a reason, and who also understands the pain you went through - and would never want it to be experienced by someone they love as well.

- You need to limit your mindset and choices

- WORKOUT, big confidence booster)

- If you have a porn/masturbation addiction please look up benefits of NOFAP (Relevant for me since it helped me heal as well)

I don't know where i'm going with this, that it WILL get better, slowly but surely, and you will be happy again (Harvest that pain into productivity... force it, just do it - if that means working out or reading books, or going out there to find a job - just do it)

“There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life.

New York
November 10

Dear Thom:

We had your letter this morning. I will answer it from my point of view and of course Elaine will from hers.

First—if you are in love—that’s a good thing—that’s about the best thing that can happen to anyone. Don’t let anyone make it small or light to you.

Second—There are several kinds of love. One is a selfish, egotistical thing which uses love for self-importance. This is the ugly and crippling kind. The other is an outpouring of everything good in you—of kindness and consideration and respect—not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable. The first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength, and courage and goodness and even wisdom you didn’t know you had.

You say this is not puppy love. If you feel so deeply—of course it isn’t puppy love.

But I don’t think you were asking me what you feel. You know better than anyone. What you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it—and that I can tell you.

Glory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it.

The object of love is the best and most beautiful. Try to live up to it.

If you love someone—there is no possible harm in saying so—only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness into consideration.

Girls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel

It sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another—but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good.

Lastly

We will be glad to meet Susan. She will be very welcome. But Elaine will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to. She knows about love too and maybe she can give you more help than I can.

And don’t worry about losing. If it is right

Love

Fa

This may have made me feel so much in a short amount of time, so many things I can do for others, so many ways I can help. This is a breakup. Yes, it really hurts that this person does not want to explore all of these things in life with me, but damn if I'm not a strong person. Everyone sees it in me. I am strong, I've gone through a lot, I am intelligent, I am perceptive

It is time for me, or just sit around waiting for him to change his mind. I love him, but hey, I've got a lot to offer this world. Maybe I can channel some of these feelings into art or something, I already have, and maybe these feelings will help me relate to others.

Every bit of suffering helps me understand more people, perfect individual by any means, but I don't regret anything that has happened... I learn from it. I wouldn't have done so much for myself, to help myself, without this breakup. I had to take a look at myself and try to make myself feel better instead of just focusing on the needs and wants of other people.

I need to, and instead time to return to well...part of who I was before I ever fell in love with anyone but mostly this new me... maybe not ""someone's"" or part of a couple or a partner in life but... just me. This person, this person who I've neglected to love as much as she deserved.

1363710332.0,1allzb,Woke up to a text message this morning.,IamJacksCancer,36,5,14,"I

When I was sixteen I met a girl just a month or two younger than me

Shortly after turning eighteen, nor did I take hers, we both had a bit of sexual experience. Our sex life was on fire, 5 to seven times a day was the usual, the record was 9 times in a night.

It wasn't just sex, no matter what happened.

We started living together, screaming fights with both of us verbally abusing the other. About anything and everything. I'd like to think that she started about 90% of the fights, at least in the start, but she would tear me apart for the simplest reasons, so I started growing resentful. I hated being treated like shit all the time, so I started being an irrational prick as well.

I came home from work one night and the house was empty. I went out and got drunk

After a few weeks we started talking again

That lasted for about two days. We fought again for a couple weeks, but I am going to make an active effort to make this work. You are the only thing I want in my life, please, just let me quit this job and find something new, and I promise things will be different. Just give me this chance"".

At the time

I left for work after I said that, ect.

Got home from work 14 hours later

Of course, Every couple weeks I would drive the two hours to where she was living and we'd get a hotel and pretend to be normal for a day or two. Things started working out being fun again. The hotel I was working at got shut down and my attitude on life completely changed.

After a couple months of that

Fast forward a year and half.

We never really spoke for this whole time, and then very calmly spit in my face and push me away.

These dreams tore me up more than anything in the actual relationship did.

 I got a text out of the blue a few months ago. She start talking

Very casually

Fiancee.

I'm drunk at the bar when I see this. I immediately profess my love via text message. I tell her about how I never stopped thinking about her.

She tells me the feeling is mutual and how she doesn't really love her fiancee.

I'm on cloud nine for day while we text back and forth, I'm doing good things with my life, everything is working out.

We start making plans to move in together again. I start looking at apartments in her area

She starts growing distant again. I tell myself that the novelty is starting to wear out

I start talking to a girl I met a while back. I tell myself it's fine because ""jane"" has a boyfriend and probably isn't going abstinent for me.

I went out on a date with this girl a couple weeks ago. Best first date I've ever had. Dinner

I stopped texting ""jane"" as much because I'm starting to have feelings for the new girl.

 I realize how big of a fool i've been to let ""jane"" play me for so long. I'm always the person to say ""I love you"" first. I'm always the person that calls or texts first. I'm the one waiting hours for a reply.

I open a draft e-mail

I realize that breaking it off with a girl via e-mail or text message. We both have too much time invested this.

I made the mistake of instagramming my meal on one of my dates with ""new girl"". This was a mistake because I hate when people do this

I get a text message a couple days ago: ""Who were you out to dinner with"".

I reply: ""Nothing really serious if that's what you are asking""

""I wasn't asking if it was serious. Look


I thought I would be devasted. I'm relieved. I'm shocked

I wish I would have sent my break-up e-mail first though.

I have been coming here for about 2-3 months maybe. not even sure anymore. I am still very much in love with the person i broke up with. I miss her and would kill just to hold her again. but the reality is, and move on.

1) First off.. its ok to cry. girl/boy

2) be as social as you can.. talk to as many people as you can about your problems. as for advice.. ask for companionship. let others know you need their help. the people who matter the most will surface throughout your hardships. This is the moment you see who your real friends are.

3) if you don't have any friends.. go out and make new ones. step outside your comfort zone for a change. what do you have to lose really?

4) be active.. work out.. play sports.. this helps trust me on this.. your body and mind will thank you  so much

6) no contact!!!! do not contact your ex for any reason. this will only hinder any recovery. if you want to contact your ex

this is the point in your life where you find yourself. i am currently fighting the biggest depression of my life after losing my ex

you will hurt.. you will cry.. your moods will go up and down like an elevator. there is nothing anyone will say to help you out of your darkness. you must be willing to make the effort though. the more effort you put into your recovery

Thank you to everyone who has helped me.. i hope that one day i can be happy enough on my own to find a new love. i still need some time to recover fully

Don't take this the wrong way; this subreddit is very friendly and very helpful. But, get all the support and advice you need, but at some point you'll want to start distancing yourself from breakup overload.

I really didn't improve at all in the first 2 months. But then I stopped reading about breakups, and I feel awesome - I'm perfectly comfortable with how things ended and I know I can't change the past.

1323370585.0,n55fa,"Am I the only guy in the world who thinks that your girl making out with a female friend of hers is cheating, and not ""hot"" at all?",hurtandthrownaway,33,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/n55fa/am_i_the_only_guy_in_the_world_who_thinks_that/
Yet another sob story! Woo! Who's excited? Anyhow, she cheated on me. Most of my friends seem to think that it's different if it's two girls as opposed to her kissing another guy. Some of them would say that they would be turned on even. My now-ex has said the same things to me. I guess this is my own issue, but I see all people as equals. Male, female... gay, straight... I don't care. You're either monogamous or you're not.

Since this has come out, ""Stacey"" was fooling around with somewhere around 3 different people, my ex-girl being one of them. He found out about one of the guys she fooled around with and broke up with her over it. He has no idea about the female interaction, but I feel like he probably wouldn't care much at this point. He's moved on already. 

My problem here is that since she made out with this girl, (not cheating by any means mind you) as there are bumps in every single one... but since she has come out about kissing her friend she has completely shut herself off to me. She claims that she wants things to work but doesn't give me the time of day. I just feel in my gut that her friend is manipulating her.

Last night, and my friend stopped us both near the end of our night (around 10:30pm) and called us out on our shit. We were already winding down to go home at this point, but she freaked and ""couldn't believe"" that he could say such a thing, or that we wanted to leave so early. When we got home, she went over to his house and bitched him out for two hours about saying something like that to us in public. This is totally out of her normal character! She is kind, sweet, and funny. Something has changed.

Either way, floor, etc. Totally blackout drunk. Came back from the bathroom and asked why I had stripped the bed. That bad. Got up a second time at 4am and threw up more, same questions. Again at 5am. I got almost no sleep last night and had to answer to my CEO this morning as I was late. Anyhow, I told her this morning that I deserve some respect and that I was done. She started packing, I left for work. 

After typing all of that, she has been the most amazing, funny and understanding girl I have ever been with. Recently, she has turned into a cold-hearted bitch. 

If you made it this far

TL;DR: Girlfriend makes out with female friend while I am on business trip. During a fight

I have always believed that despite the complex details that make up whatever it is we were facing… we simply needed to ask a single question to figure out what to do next…

That question was simple; What do you want?

I have always and continue to respond

It seems that at this point in our relationship you can’t say the same.

Your silence speaks volumes; your expressionless face tells me your answer.

I am realizing you let go a long time ago

I can’t continue to fight for something that is no longer mutual.

To continue to do so will rip me apart.

I no longer hold you to the vows we spoke 20 years ago.

It’s not fair to either of us. I am so so sorry.

I’m letting go.

Falling on hard times and just wanted to put my thoughts down into writing... to share my story and perhaps do a little venting.  Thanks in advance for reading.  

In my experience, resentment builds and things go sour.  It's happened to me in past relationships and I'm sure it's happened to you once or twice.

See, and I thought things couldn't be better.  I knew I would be spending the rest of my life with this woman.  

Welp.  So much for that.

Time machine to two months ago.  She returned from a long business trip and I could sense immediately something was off.  She was distant and withdrawn.  I asked if everything was okay.  It took some prying to get it out of her, and that I never made the proper effort to do so.  While I was blindsided by this revelation, I was understanding, patient and graceful.

I held myself accountable for everything.  I took responsibility for not being my best self, and I made a concerted effort to work on these things because I wanted my wife back.  I vowed to improve not just for her and for our marriage, but for myself.  Cue self-improvement montage: Started personal counseling, read self-improvement books, sought advice from friends and family.  I gathered the tools to set myself up for success in the marriage and took action.  At that point, however, it was too late.  After many days of discussion, and that I was solely to blame for the dissolution of our relationship.  I encouraged her to participate in marriage counseling with me

She herself never pushed specifically for a divorce, and that if I truly loved her I had to let her go.

It turns out she had left out one salient detail.  Imagine my surprise when I find out the whole time she has been blaming me for all that is wrong with our relationship, booking clandestine vacations, making long term plans.  Actually apologizing to him about having to be sneaky, and needing to take care of her baggage back home.  Can you believe that?  I have become her baggage.  I am nothing more than a loose end that she needs to take care of so she can move on with her life with this new man she now “loves”.  

I feel completely hoodwinked.  I trusted her like a retarded loyal dog and she cheated on me.  While that alone is a huge slap in the face, she was “sorry” when she got caught, but I think it was “sorry” THAT she got caught, not that she threw me under a bus and played me like a fiddle.  She claims that she still loves and respects me, but her actions speak for themselves.  That’s not love and respect, that’s complete and utter contempt thereof.  Just a complete dereliction of character…

I feel slightly vindicated, I’m the kind of person who gives 100% to fight for a cause I believe in, and she’s the kind of person who jumps to the next best thing because it's easier.  The kind of person who spoils what they have by desiring what they have not… Never satiated.  The kind of person always chasing that fleeting excitement.  The kind of person who will probably never be really, truly happy.

I’ll be fine.  My life has come crashing down. I've been spending the last few months trying to pick up the pieces

Cheers

TL;DR:  Thought I found the love of my life.  Yeah

**EDIT:** It looks like my words resonated with a lot of you who have gone (or are currently going) through a similar experience.  I'd like to share what has helped me stay positive through this shitstorm.  Like I mentioned above, even if you can’t quite see it yet.  Moreover, it will still be there when you’re ready to approach it.  It takes a lot of strength and courage to pick yourself up, dust off and start moving forward.  Once you start doing that, things will get better with time.  I know that for a fact, my friends.

But i think i've just had a breakthrough and i wanted to share it.

I was very much in love with my now ex of 2 years. I still am probably as it's only been a short time since we split. But I have slowly been trying to heal myself (hit the gym

I realized that I was waiting for his emails/fb's and was bending myself inside out trying to decipher a hidden meaning (he kept saying he was thinking of me).

A couple of days ago I asked for a Skype date and we had one. I told him I loved him, but with the perspective of a month, I see that i was glossing over a number of issues that WERE big). He told me he loved me, a part of him wanted to be with me, but he didn't think it would work. I sort of knew this was coming.

Throughout this breakup process he has said much the same thing. He has said

We had dinner just before we both left and when he drove me home I asked him point blank if he wanted to be with me. His response: ""Not right now.""
Me: does that mean no?
Him: no...

All of my friends and family have said this is unfair and his confusion/indecisive speak has been stringing me along.

Finally today I made a decision.

I am not attracted to someone who doesn't know point blank that I am the right person for him. I have felt this about him for months

He doesn't deserve me right now.

And it is over.

The breakthrough is deciding for myself that I don't want to be with him.

During our Skype conversation I told him we needed to have a period of NO CONTACT. I deleted him off FB. I told his brothers (two of my closest friends) what the score was.

When we were saying goodbye over Skype he was teary

He can't have me. I'm worth more than indecisive fear. We were talking (I was talking) about moving in together at the end of the year.

I can't be with someone who balks at the gate.

Make the choice in your mind to be happy and to be single. They don't deserve you. Maybe one day they will

If I feel differently, I will let you know."" She took the things she wanted and left me to clean the mess, pay the bills and deal with the lease.",ChasingRainbows,1, but as the 1 year mark approaches

**Prehistory:**
I met a girl, my friends and family, as *she* or *her*.

In the beginning we started out, devoid of religious connotation, kept our purity. After that, we both mutually felt we could offer each other something more. During the summer before we were official, she used to come over and we would make supper, watch TV shows or movies on my laptop, and sometimes lay on my bed in a head-to-head way, but as the summer wore on, etc. This seemed like a very natural progression

**The Dark Ages:**
I was due to fly to the USA from Canada 2 days after we were officially together to attend a friends wedding. She used this time to tell her parents about it. Evidently they did not see the ideal aspect of two friends being together due to a small age gap. Normally I dislike the idea of a girl being in high school and being with someone older who is out of high school, I had been to her house (she lived on a farm 40 minutes outside of town) over a dozen times, met her parents, had supper with her family many times, etc. so I clearly wasn't a terrible person out for ""only one thing"" and we had a prior friendship as our foundation. We ended up *sneaking* to see each other after either of us got off work or before she went to school, etc. but one night her mother saw my car parked next to hers in the mall parking lot (having a lime green car was kind of detrimental to sneaking around). Her father phoned me the next day and wanted to talk with me. He said they (he and her mother) felt I was too old for her, but if ""it's meant to be, and if we wait (until she's 18) and it happens, her parents asked what she wanted as a gift and she said to see me. They relented. A sort of awkward birthday supper at a restaurant ensued and I tried my best to not remember the time we had to wait to be with each other or hold it against them. I told her when she'd discuss being fed up with their decision, I put a ring on her finger. She knew it was coming and was anxious with excitement when I told her to close her eyes. Her huge smile as I slipped the ring on her finger burns in my mind.

**Post Dark Ages:**
Finally we were free. When we would meet, things got better and better. Devoid of ego or elitism, I used to be almost *envy* myself(?) because of what I had with her that many people likely would never experience. She used to talk about how chivalry was dead, but once we were together, she realized it wasn't entirely dead. I treated her like the princess that she was (which became a nickname of sorts) and she used to talk about me saving her from a world of stupid ineffectual and inconsiderate people (we lived in a fairly redneck town and she went to a fairly redneck school). The saddest part up until this point was how I, before being with her, used the nickname Tinuviel for someone I was with briefly before, I fought a war against time to wait for her. Arwen waited for Aragorn

http://i.imgur.com/wC8oN2U.jpg

As her graduation drew near she determined she wanted to be a teacher. She was accepted into a university that was 2 hours away. No worries, looks up at me with her beautiful sunlight filled brown eyes and softly says ""Finally, we made it..."" I kissed her and carried her to our bedroom where we christened the bed.

As the days passed, carved pumpkins and had a tiny Xmas tree. Being too excited for Xmas, she wanted to open gifts early. Her gift to me was new cologne which she promptly sprayed onto me, along with lingerie which she modeled. It was the best Xmas ever. Having family in other cities, we spent the first half of the holiday with her family and the second half with mine. She always liked visiting my family. So we came back after the holidays were over and she wanted to move to a larger apartment. No problem. We found a nice one and moved into it in mid February. She even brought her cat from her parents house. I thought now she had everything she wanted: A larger apartment, a room to study in, a bigger kitchen, we would hug and kiss in greeting as we always had done. All throughout our time living together

**Prelude to The New Dark Ages:**
It was her birthday just over 1 month after we moved into our new apartment. As mid-March drew closer, then we went to The Trews and talks about how it was the best birthday and how great I am. Soon after was to be the release of The Hunger Games. Having read the book, she really wanted to see the film. I decided to read it first and finished it in 3 days before opening night. We went to purchase our tickets from a kiosk and she did something she never had done before... The debit machine wasn't accepting the card as I was trying to swipe it. She took the card, tried to swipe it herself, and as it didn't accept it, she threw my debit card on the ground. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but what's the big deal to throw it on the ground? I, didn't know what to do. I was close to calling the night off, plus we were in love, and after I did the dishes

After a few days of despondency, that she had an initial feeling of being unsure of us which she CONCLUDED was actually a feeling of being unsure of her future in terms of career, living location, etc., but that she the ONE THING she was ABSOLUTELY sure of was in fact ""us"". She declared me to me a pillar in her life, her soulmate, her confidant, where she'd live

**The New Dark Ages:**
We were set to go to my hometown and visit my family for the Easter break, went to work, came home, we made quiche and had one of our ""naked naps"" during the afternoon. She woke up distant and disconnected. ""What's wrong?"", ""Nothing""... Over the next few days she would gradually stop looking at me to the point that when she responded, she wasn't looking at me at all. She still ate the dinners I made. I went to sleep on the couch but she wanted me to sleep in the bed. I said ""You aren't coming with me this weekend, are you..."" she said no. I asked if she was leaving. Tears filled her eyes and poured down her face within seconds. Her lips trembled and her voice uttered an almost inaudible ""Yes..."" I asked her why. She said something about not being happy. I asked why. She couldn't answer. Not because of her cutting the eternal bond she so cherished, ""No

That night I was out until 4am walking. It was something like -15 out and I was freezing after being outside for around 7 hours. I tried sleeping in my car. I can't go back inside, check her Facebook, no messages except one to her Grandma asking if she can move back in... Why am I on the couch... I ask her cat what's wrong with ""her"", but a meowing response doesn't clarify anything. As the dawn breaks, I shower for what will be the start to a long road emotionally tolling road ahead. I grab my pre-packed bag from the bedroom. She is there. The tuft of brown hair that I miss so much is poking out of the covers. Did she miss my warmth? I kiss her on the forehead and whisper ""I will love you forever..."" and leave.

I get to the office. I call my Mom and in tears I said that ""she"" is leaving. My Mom is appalled. She can't believe it. My Mom loved her almost as much as I did. I go back in the office, tells me to leave work and drive back to my hometown. My hometown is 7.5 hours away, and the city I lived in prior is 2 hours away. I stop here and talk to the 2 friends I lived with prior. They are surprised at the news, and SO KINDLY offer me the option of moving back in. I will never forget their kindness during the shittiest moment in my life, when they took me in and helped me.

The weekend passes and there's no word from her. I don't eat any food or get any sleep. I throw up about 15 or 20 times over the course of 5 nights

**Picking up the pieces:**
I drive back to the apartment. A 7.5 hour drive in dead silence without any music after not sleeping or eating. I walk into the apartment and find a mess. Things left and discarded. Evidently she only took what she wanted as the couch was left, empty soap/shampoo bottles, and the litter/food from her cat on the floor... No time for sweeping for this ditch, I guess. There's also discarded notes on the counter including one I left her a few days prior: ""Remember last night?"" which is now unable to even be thrown away, just left in a garbage bag on the counter. Something I find interest, though, is that when we first moved in, but didn't exchange the chairs. I could never figure out why...

I discover that as she took was what she wanted, skates, unused cat litter box, a empty bottles of soap/shampoo. Why... I pack up my computer, clothes, go to work and get my work computer, and drive to a town 2 hours away to stay with my friends

Unfortunately I am now forced to make the 2 hour trip back and forth to move my stuff. I know where she moved back to, Cornelius, that began our elephant obsession.

Like a fool, because we were in love... Maybe she'll come back. She said if she feels different she'll let me know. Maybe she'll realize. Maybe she will remember those times when I would hold her so tight. I was in too much of a messed up mental state to even think about the rent really, though maybe that's what she was hoping for? I wonder if there any ""what have I done..."" realizations afterwards, or if it was only an emotional weight released from her after she left. Live and learn, I guess. I'm thankful for my friends, who were mostly online friends, as sort of sad as it sounds

**Arrakis:**
Knowing I would be miserable and spiraling downward, but I couldn't get her out of my mind if I tried. Sometimes I still can't. I'd go to sleep and invariably dream about her. Scumbag brain to the extreme. Everything is fine and then I awake to personal tragedy. I'd wake up from a restless sleep, go running for about 3-5 kilometers, come back, puke, wretch and gag, shower, come home, she was the Evenstar, the brand name I bought is the same name as hers. Kind of expensive

One time in particular about a month or two after the event, and asked if I wanted her to drop them off. I couldn't believe it... She was asking if I wanted ski pants and gloves back when she left me to deal with all of her stuff, the bills for rent and utilities, the heartache... Having had the read receipts on my phone, she knows I read these, and as I didn't respond, she said ""I assume by your silence that you don't want them?"" Why would I ever care about ski pants and gloves... 

Taking my newly acquired freedom into account, but she became sort of attached and wanted to be more. I didn't. I couldn't. Well, I could, and in a way I suppose I was drawn between liking the idea of her and liking her. I admitted to her that I ""liked the idea"", but I definitely wasn't ready for a relationship and I'm still not. A few people I know had said ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" but I only ever wanted to be with one person. I found that bliss, but something happened and I don't think I will ever fully escape the despondent lack of panic in her eyes the last time I saw her. But, at least I can sleep better these days

http://i.imgur.com/JRVMDFS.png

For what would have been our anniversary in August, explained the unfairness of being left to deal with everything and how insane it was to think I'd care about ski pants or gloves. She undoubtedly already knew this, but whatever. I also said ""I give you to what you never had the courage to me give me: An honest goodbye"" and wished her family well. I wished her the best, but to never again treat anyone else with as much disdain as she treated me with.

**A boot stamping on a human face forever:**
While adventuring through this long road of recovery, suddenly they weren't, no real conversation was ever had as to why. Suddenly she was gone and I was left with the apartment, largely populated by her things, bills, and so forth. So what do I learn from this? That no matter how much effort and love that exists, people can leave and ditch out on any real responsibility? I don't know what really happened to her in the end, aside from her actions, they love you, but it won't ever be as intense

In this time of recovery, and my dreams are still sometimes plagued with her presence. In a way it feels like it happened yesterday, in another way it feels like it was 10 years ago, in a way it feels like it never happened except in dreams. I feel like I wish there was justice to be had. That her family would knew about it in more detail, that her friends knew, that anyone she meets later on knows, but instead I feel bereft. I could die tomorrow and the person who once called me soulmate would never know and probably wouldn't even care. I am running out the clock and looking forward to a point in time when, I will feel like Winston from 1984 after he has been tortured, I have endless motivation for songwriting

And so

But I think it just got to the point where he needed to decide if he was in it for the long haul or not

I did think about breaking up with him too, or wanting to plan it. It felt like a mind game sometimes. A few months leading up to our breakup he did start to talk about things in a more permanent way. He started making subtle mentions of a future with us in it together. That's what ultimately stopped me from ending things. In retrospect, I think this had to happen and would have happened no matter what.

Regardless, they took  me out to movies, went out for dessert, they did everything. I am so incredibly grateful they were there for me. 

I tried to go NC but I definitely texted/called/emailed/FB messaged him at least once a week

About 3 months after the breakup I completely flipped out and sent him a message with a lot of angry and hurtful things. I was just really angry that he left me, he has now gone to ignoring me completely which also hurts, but I understand. I guess I just hope one day he forgives me in his heart, knowing I was just going through a hard time. 

Immediately I started taking steps to getting better. In the last 7 months I've lost weight, got into new hobbies, went overseas, plan on going overseas again this summer, went on a whole bunch of dates with different people, etc, etc. I feel like I'm closer to being the kind of person I've always wanted to be

I still get sad sometimes though. Because I really did love that man and I really did want to spend the future with him. Besides his issues with commitment

I've spent a lot of time hoping he'll miss me. He'll call me and want to get back together with me. That he's the one. But it hasn't really helped me move on. And I don't think it's going to happen.

I've decided that: if he's the one, there is literally nothing I can do or say (or have done and said) that will change that outcome or make it happen sooner. Same if it isn't meant to be. There are only 2 possibilities of what will happen next: one day we get back together, or one day I meet someone who will make me just as happy (if not happier). In the end, I will be happy and loved.

It's been a bit easier since I've started thinking that way.",,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ayf19/he_broke_up_with_me_7_months_ago_here_is_my/

*I wanted to conclude my experience on /r/breakups six months after I got dumped. So I'm going to hopefully make this my final post here! It's long

**The Breakup**

I [22/m] got dumped by my first love [21/f] after a 9 month relationship. After several weeks of cold and distant behavior, and it ended a few weeks later. I found out several months later that she had cheated on me repeatedly, used me as a rebound relationship to get over her first love, and spun a thorough web of lies to cover up both.

**No Contact**

I’ve maintained No Contact from the moment she dumped me. Six whole months of not seeing her. Although it was hard at times, from her perspective, not something that she wanted to have to deal with. Please, please, please give them space. Chances are they don't want to hear from you anyway.

**Six Months Later - Revelations**

By the time Month Six rolls around

The time for discovery around now is pretty much over. You’ve learned the most within the first three months

**Deleting from Facebook**

I had spent about six months with my ex still on my Facebook friends list. I had a really hard time keeping myself from looking at her Facebook profile for the first month or so. It broke my heart every time I saw her on Facebook.

Do yourself a favor and delete them from your friends list.

I was drunk watching basketball a couple weeks ago, and every friend of hers off my facebook. At first, I woke up the next morning really regretting it. She no longer has any way of contacting me, I have no way of contacting her, her family, or her friends! On the one hand, deleting them all felt like a drastic measure and a huge mistake, it actually has done wonders. If you have read my entire ‘saga’ on here, I made the possibility of this meetup completely reduced to zero. And that really upset me. My ego doesn’t want her to get away with what she did. She used me, and I wanted to tell her that I think very little of her because of it

**Emotions**

I'm not sure if there's anything that could happen now at this point that would get me *really* emotional again. Some things still bother me, and in a sense, just exhausted by all of it. Six months later, you're not going to get up out of bed, take a deep breath, and gaze out into that lovely Spring day, listening to the birds chirping. You're going to wake up and get back into the routine, but you're definitely in a better place in Month 6.

**Dreams**

Haven't had a dream about her in months. Actually

**etc.**

You don’t get over it

You don't feel the urge to talk about your ex

Six months is a long freaking time. So much stuff has happened in the past six months

**Self Improvement**

All the goals you set for yourself in Month 1 will be, new gym routines, new diets - I've kept them all, and I've seen results. Even better - I don't do it with her in mind anymore. I do it for myself, and I do it because it makes me happy!

**Final Thoughts**

I've finally realized that I simply will never 'get over it' completely. The term 'get over it' has been the bane of my existence since breakup day 1. All I think of is when will I be back to normal. And the answer, and to think that those you were in love with would cease to hold any importance is just silly.

Maybe it’s because she was my first love. Maybe it’s because she cheated on me so much and crushed me in a way I haven't felt before. But the important part is that not only have I accepted that I won’t ever ‘get over it’ but that it would be a waste if I did. 

To me, poetic, and beautiful lesson of all is that I’ll never get over it in that kind of way. She’ll always be a part of me, and the effect she had on me is permanent. The times we shared were life-changing in many ways. I do believe that everything happens for a reason, that every person and every situation we encounter, no matter how small, has some sort of purpose for all of us as individuals. I’m a believer in destiny, happened for a reason. The universe had to teach me about love and about how important love is. I know now that love is the most important thing for humans to have

**TL;DR – It will take a while, but you have to accept the fact that this person you lost changed your life irreversibly. Maybe your life changed only a little bit, maybe it changed a whole lot.**

Thanks for everything /r/breakups! I’ve gotten lots of PMs from you guys over these months and it makes me sooooo happy knowing how much I’ve helped so many people. I love to hear from you all

1357840358.0,16borr,Broken hearts and chewing gum: A treatise on healing and moving on from the abyss of heartbreak. ,komputerwelt,33,4,19,"**Prelude:**

This is not really a treatise, you might not. I understand that this analogy can seem a bit silly, but please, don't write off this post this instant moment, and try to bear with me, despite its great length. The gum analogy is merely an instrument in trying and explaining my point. I write for you and for myself. I have randomly added some links to songs that came up in my head during the writing process that I have related to during the last 7 months of heartache, it's just some kind of quirk I have with associating things with music, but they're there for the curious listener. I've added a TLDR in the end but I don't think it really covers up my point. So if you can, I apologize in advance for any defects in my English

**So here goes for nothing:**

For the last 7 months I have read so much on heartbreak, and help me in coping and moving on from my heartbreak. A conquistador of the broken heart new world, if you will, scouring the endless plains for the city of gold, the gold that will enrich me with the knowledge of how to move on from this seemingly never-ending pain, suffering, longing. 
I have yet to have found this golden city, this post is not the enlightening post that will heal all. The thing which contains this power, I have come to believe, is, as much as we all hate to hear it, time. But to this equation of time I want, via this post, with the help of cognitive training. 

**The curious case of the tasteless gum**

Today I was chewing a gum. At a certain point during this very important event, I extracted the gum from my mouth with my left hand in order to be able to take a few healthy sips from my bottle of water. That I did, and the coughing madness came almost to an immediate halt. Content and happy I carried on to return the chewing gum into my mouth. But surprise surprise, it was glued to my hand, really really hard. 

Despite this natural physical fact, decided not to give up on this gum, and I proceeded in trying and forcefully ripping it off the palm of my hand. The result was that of a complete chaos; my whole hand was smeared with gum, it was all over my fingers. Everything was gooey and every movement of my hand left trails of gum all over the place. My left hand was rendered, temporarily, unusable. 

Luckily, I spent around 15 minutes, more or less, in trying to clean the endless bits of dry gum on my hand. It was very-very exhausting, and I deeply regretted not just throwing that gum away the moment I decided to drink water. 

Why would I want to get back to chewing this gum, and its flavor was long gone by the time my water-demanding cough session began. Why put it back in my mouth? I could, for example, take another gum, or, better yet, stop chewing altogether

Yet, I couldn't even bring to my mind the healthy thought of letting it go for it has ceased filling its role. I was chewing that gum and therefore I must keep chewing it! 

The chewing of this gum has ceased serving any purpose, because over time it has become what you conceive as your role, but the gum itself, it has ceased filling its role, the only thing it might give you, provided it's not one of those healthy gums, is a good cavity for your dentist to fill.


**Heartbreak, more tears, NC, texts from ex, birthdays, breaking NC, catharsis**

Seven long months ago my SO of 22 months then, destroyed, put here any other word that you are probably accustomed to using and relating to since your heart was broken. A huge incubus on my chest every morning I wake up and realize that [she's gone.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DbUfH8s2MM) 

I was Carthage obliterated by the Might of the decaying Roman Republic, enlarging my pain, making sure nothing will grow. I wallowed in regret and pain, going about my normal day I was suddenly struck with sweet memories, deep waves of sadness ensued, a teary eye. [She is now somebody else's girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NAgxNtbzlw).

My nights were plagued with images of her and the faceless guy who proved, experiencing the best sex in the whole wide world, in a way that demands the ancient Hindus to rewrite the Kama Sutra. Nothing had any taste anymore. Everything was associated with her, and this seemingly bottomless pit of despair. 

After a period of masochism, and refrained from checking on the various social networks. I did not notify her of me initiating NC, hence, two months after my disconnection from her, she started texting me, asking if I am doing okay. I ignored all these texts, over a period of 3 months, because the notion of speaking to the ""new"" her was so frightening to me that I just decided to keep silent. It was painful

Yet I was miserable. I missed her. I thought about her every single day. I was wondering how she is doing. What is she doing. I was [wondering who's kissing her now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56V_RjJhCQs&amp;feature=related)

As her birthday was coming up, because I knew that I'd eat myself if I wouldn't, I wanted her to know that I remember, that I still care, and I always will, and I will, because once I love someone

But another incentive, who knows, she might want me back, but she is so afraid because I ignored her that she will never tell me. The 0.0000001% that she is currently lying in her bed wetting the pillows, acknowledging the great mistake that she has made in giving up my love.

After much thinking, reading this long and tedious post that began with a chewing gum. She answered, sounding a little surprised. She wasn't cold or distant, as she was on our last phone call initiated by her in late June giving me the [lowdown]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EoK4OelZU) that ""it's over"", following the really long love ""don't-leave-me-I-can't-live-with-out-you"" letter I mailed her, accompanied by flowers and chocolate. The next two days after that call in wretched June of 2012, were spent listening to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EoK4OelZU), thinking [I can't live without her love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5XS1CZV9w4).

You know these quick conversations you have with people you know, worked with, that you come by and speak and catch up and then go about your ways, not giving that occurrence much thought. So I felt that our phone call, was exactly like this, for her. She did not realize just how significant this phone call was for me, nor did she care much
 
It struck me with full force, pining for someone who, emotionally, was worlds away from me. It baffled me and it still does, as it does you, I bet, how people can just stop loving you. It's an interesting, but unfortunately I don't think there is any one definite answer to it. The only annoying answer I can provide is: they just do. They stop loving you, asking why

**[E=mc^2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzqim-RHq7Y) (minus one)**

This is not some big world-shaking discovery, that you fend off any bit of rational. Because why would you accept it? They're the one that got away, they're your everything, they are all, they are the universe, the Olympus of emotions, the good morning text

Why would you accept it? Your pain is so strong it blinds you. I ached hard after I called my ex. I ""broke"" five long hard months of the NC that I so promoted with so much vigor and conviction in authentic belief of this certain route. It hit me that while, emotionally, it is 15 light years. It's over and done, she's moved on, she's in a different place. 

Therefore I asked myself this question: what will I do now? Where will I stay? Do I have anywhere to stay? Do I have anything to cling to? Will I remain in this imagined bed of misery and sorrow, knowing that one road will bring me nowhere; it's a dead-end path, I must take the other one because I have no choice, it is frightening, I don't know where it will bring me, but this is the only choice I have, unless I, enjoy bumping into dead-end signs. 

**Conclusion**

Six days have passed since I called her and there's no other way to put it. I can't believe that I am writing this but I am: I feel better. Two days ago I felt genuinely happy. It was such a good feeling that I haven't experienced for more than 7 months. It was so good I documented on a (real) note-pad. Indicating the exact time and date I wrote that I am genuinely happy because of this and that, that it is possible. [I could be happy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQfUYZ0mS1M). 

And I want you to know: this is so liberating. **THIS IS SUCH A RELIEF**. A new text message arrives; I do not jump, that ""I know that for 99%, it isn't her, but who knows, there's still the 1% that it is!"". No sir, that 1% is gone. [At last, I am free](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo0LYX6COv0). 

This is not a quick fix, but it's different, it's like I had some kind of illumination that changed the way I think about it. It still hurts but the pain is different, and it will subside with time. 

You might say this is a cold rationalizing of a broken heart and how to deal with it, I am not comparing the object of your broken heart, this special person, to a chewing gum, to something you chew and throw away, I'm only using it as a metaphor. It's a chewing you'll always remember and possibly cherish. I am not by any means disregarding the deep, strong, believe me

And if you are hurting now and it is fresh it will keep hurting. If you were dumped/replaced/left/abandoned yesterday or today or last week or last month or, you are probably thinking ""yeah, [but not for me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_f_mMJAezM)"", brushing me off. You are the special one. You are the one who'll never recover from this horrible thing called heartbreak. Forever alone and all that nonsense. 

But eventually it will happen, and I won't deceive you, it'll keep on hurting, it is a function of time no matter what, but by writing these words I hope that, maybe, somehow, provide you with another option for a way to look at what you are going through.

I apologize for the length of this post. I am not deluding myself that many have read it, you have found some substance in it. Believe it. You have substance. You mean something. [You are loved](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B8j9XDOMic). [You can do it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow_NGabKR6k). You will do it. Despite all the pain you still exist, you are still breathing, the birds will sing tomorrow morning. I know you don't give a damn, I know that you only want that special fish, but the fact that there are [other fish in the sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA0IUwtKwhE) is as solid as the fact that the sun will shine tomorrow.

**TLDR (which is actually also quite lengthy, and if you read the whole post, keep reading, there's some advice + a motivational passage)**

I don't want to do this, please, take a few minutes and read the whole post. still, I will summarize my post because I want to hug you all and I know how painful it is and I wish that you could find some sense in my ranting, so if you managed to ignore my pleading to read all of the post, what I'm saying is that basically:

* When you keep loving someone who stopped loving you, there is no ""turn off love"" switch, we all wish there was, that is obvious, but if you think rationally it might help that thing called ""time"" to heal and move on. 

* Miracles mostly only happen in fairy tales; let go of the 1% that they might want you back. 

* I let go of that 1% by calling my ex after 5 months of NC. I realized she's in a different place, and it has helped me too, I felt ready to ""break"" NC because I felt enough time has passed for me to be able to receive that blow of ""reality"" from contacting my ex and seeing who she is; that strike of reality helped me move on. 

* Your mind is strong and [it is the only thing you have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Snv88jCtjY&amp;list=FLcUKXmMVvLOynJhb-L-13Vg), do you use NC to actually heal or just to lessen the pain until the person who broke your heart will get a nightly visit from fat old Cupid, threatening to sue them in the higher court of love and justice, if she/he will not return to you in 24 hours and confess their mistake. If the answer is positive, have I got news for you: it won't happen. Get it? It's done, kapisch? Alles ist vorbei. Now wear your sneakers and go out for a run. 

**Some practical advice about things to do

* Rekindle old friendships. **I JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THIS MAKES YOU FEEL**

* Listen to music you love. 

* Start Meditating. Look into mindfulness. Live in the present moment. Appreciate the small things.

* Exercise. 
 
* Remember that there was a YOU in this world before you came to know the person who broke your sensitive little heart. Remembered? Good. Now start to go back and do what that person who was you before the heartbreak used to do, singing, writing, reading about German metaphysics. Do what you used to love to do, even if you don't feel like doing it. For example, I really liked writing. I couldn't write anything the last 7 months because all that would come out was misery and pain, and why write anyway? It serves no purpose because it will not bring her back to me. So here I am, disclosing my what you probably perceive a weird

* Watch HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".

* If it's cold and dark outside and you're feeling miserable, so down-to-earth, filled with good intentions. It's funny that there is so much love in a place where the theme is the loss of love, the massive pain that love brings. 

**And finally

*Do not spend your thoughts upon other people, nor guess at what he is about, or why he is doing it. Think upon nothing but what you could willingly tell about, so that if your soul were laid open there would appear nothing but what was sincere, good-natured and public-spirited. A man thus qualified is a sort of priest and minister of the gods, and makes a right use of the divinity within him. Be cheerful; depend not at all on foreign supports, nor beg your happiness of another; do not throw away your legs to stand upon crutches.*

*If, temperance and fortitude, or to a mind self-satisfied with its own rational conduct and entirely resigned to fate, then turn to it as to your supreme happiness. But if there be nothing more valuable than the divinity within you, if all things are trifles in comparison with this, then do not divide your allegiance. Let your choice run all one way, and be resolute for that which is best. As for other speculations

I left what I thought was the woman of my dreams and hit the reset button on large pieces of my life.  It's been a severe challenge as we were together for 9 years.  The gamut has included a bad car accident, and a family that will never be the same.  

This will be the first time in 9 years


The pain comes and goes, my wonderful job, and new relationships - relationships that are allowing me to become a better person. 

Dating is a completely new thing for me as well.  But the women I've had the pleasure of being with, compassion, and kindness.  

I can't say I'm falling in love but I feel loved.  On occasion

My advice to you, go out and be with friends even though you don't want to go out and be social.  I force myself to go out with friends, to meet new people, I bury myself in work, I go for long runs &amp; bicycle rides, I go to the gym and swim.  

Get out and make yourself happy.  Happiness and love aren't going to drop out of the sky into your lap, and look in new places.

So often losing a significant other is treated with finality

We are each filled with infinite potential.  We could live a thousand different lives, how can we let one relationship make us feel as if we are somehow ""over?""

Recently, with scraggly hair, a filthy dorm room and no job could POSSIBLY be the last version of myself capable of standing on his own two feet, of being happy without a lover? We can live without them.  The idea that we can't is a lie we tell them to emphasize our love.  Eventually, we internalize it.  It's still a lie. You are you, nothing and no one can change that.

How many of you are wondering ""how long until I feel like ME again?""  It's a terrifying question.  For so long, the town you wanted to live in, the people you made time to see and the hobbies you pursued.  You don't need to compromise anymore.  You can fill that space with any activity, person or place you choose.  In what other situation do you suddenly get such freedom to change your future?  The new you will be forever touched by the lover you lost.  The contributed to everything from your worldview to your taste in music.  But that doesn't mean that they own you.  They own you no more than you own your apartment; you decorate it to your liking, but the rooms are the rooms and eventually you'll move on. 

There isn't much we can do to dull the pain of heartbreak.  The best we can do is to offset the tragedy of losing someone else with the joy of rediscovering ourselves.  Your heart will force you to mourn the loss of your support system.  Your potential DEMANDS that you celebrate the loss of your excuses.  So cry,,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,True

Go get those tats, and free spirit mentality. I wish I could be in the background when you bring home your new boyfriend. The new boyfriend you have just weeks after breaking up with me, saying that a relationship wasn't good for you right now. I'd love to see your parent's faces as they look at all of the tattoos he already has, the gauges in his ears, definitely money well spent. I would pay 1,000 dollars to have a picture of your father and brothers' reactions when he says that his career is being a musician. They'll be able to tell, this kid is going places. You picked a winner, he has such a deep and romantic view about life

It's a great idea to have a boyfriend at a different college, that's more than an hour's drive away, with no link but himself to you. Nah, you guys have been going out for like 3 weeks, it's definitely enough time to have such a bond, and such deep trust and understanding. He'll be able to resist and fend off all of those sexier, more confident girls who aren't looking for anything but a quick fuck. He's different than the rest. Why would he say he loved you if he didn't mean it?

I want to be there when your heart breaks. When he dips it in liquid nitrogen and shatters it on a marble floor. When you find out he's been with someone else, a guy who would swim the Atlantic just to be with you. When you reach for my hand but it's no longer there. When you call out for help, but all you hear is your own voice, dancing away, alone on the icy winds. When you search for me, but all you find is a trail of footprints leading endlessly away in the snow. When you know I left you in the cold like you deserve, like you did to me. 

You think you know pain, but you just can't stop, because you love them so much. When you pull out your hair, when you try to reach out, but nothing greets you but silence. A silence that has physical substance, that traps you in its inescapable embrace. As it pulls you under and fills your lungs with it's oily viscosity. When the first thought when you wake up, and the last thought before you fall asleep is how shitty of a person you are, the terrible

Real quick, it wasn't the best relationship.  She left me on and off about 5 times in the last year and a half, still I am not sure why I stood for it.  The final break up was 2 months ago and she left for good, so I am here to tell you how I feel after 2 months. 

Initially, maybe 2. It was extremely painful and made me cling to hope that she will be back. About 2 weeks after the break up I asked her if she likes anyone new, she told me yes. I asked if she has been on a date she told me that she isn't going to answer that. I felt as if I had been torn in half, my heart sank.  I told her I can't speak to her anymore and that I need space for me.

I recall telling her that I hate her or that I want to hate her

2 more weeks pass and I see her on campus and I speak to her briefly, but to me it is a yes. 

I have been going to counseling on campus and that does help. 

But something has happened recently and I'll try and tell you what it is. I have been writing down my thoughts and how I feel. I keep track of when I think of her and how often/how long and how intense it is on a scale of 1-10. It helps me to track my progress of moving on. And that has helped immensely. 

But what happened was

The past few days have also been better. Of course, I don't feel that way anymore. It has passed.

The thoughts that I hold on to that make me feel better are that the relationship wasn't right for me and I deserved to be treated better. I look to the future and that I now have the opportunity to have someone love me they I would love them. I felt and sometimes still do feel as if I am constantly battling with myself to remind myself it is ok to move on. I sometimes would get sucked back into hope and thinking how great it was but instead of looking at the wonderful memories think about the ones that hurt you. Remember the times that made your heart sink while you were with them. It helps. 

The last thing I want to say is get the fuck out of your comfort zone. Walk some where you would normally drive to, go to bed earlier, change your routine, change your room, take on new challenges and do something new. Live your life and new experience things. 

I have tried some new shit and done new things and it helps you figure out who you are.  And it feels great. I am going to start something called geocaching

Hello. 

I miss you. We haven't spoken once since the night you left. Trust me, a key chain, the small candy-filled stocking you gave me a month ago, the nerdy necklace you were so proud of finding, that dress you liked so much on me, the bar we danced at last St. Patrick's Day, every street we've walked together, every toke we shared... I see you in all of these things and I can't seem to stop. 

I am angry. I'm angry that I tried so hard after you gave up, you'd want me like you used to. I told myself if I just gave you everything you'd ever asked of me, then you would want to be in this relationship with me. In the end, I'm not sure why you weren't happy with me anymore. I gave you every last bit of myself and then some, and it still wasn't enough. I know you're sorry. I know you didn't want to hurt me. I know the reason you dragged it out for so long is because you were worried what it would do to me. But quite frankly, I don't care. I gave you EVERYTHING, and you couldn't even give me one day a month. All I ever did was love you and You. Broke. My. Heart. Your good intentions don't mean anything because at the end of the day

I am sad. I'm sad because you have left a tremendous void in me. I gave you so much and when you left, I'm looking for a new job, I'm working out again, I'm making new friends, I'm meeting new people. I'm doing all the right things and going through the motions in the hopes that, one day, I can actually feel good doing those things. When I'm not sad, and you know that. I can't wait to CARE again. 

I am worried. I worry that I won't find someone I care about as much as I cared for you. I feel positive that I can find someone who will love me better than you did, I might have ruined myself for someone who actually would have been worth it. 

I am relieved. I feel relief because, but your actions never followed suit. You never gave of yourself, you never opened up, you never let me in, you never put me first, you never thought what you could do to bring me happiness. I was always thinking of you, and you were always thinking of you, for the first time in four years, flirt with men

I am done. I'm writing this letter because I know I need to let you go. There will be periods of withdrawal, longing, fatigue, and emptiness... But there are so many good things to look forward to, as well. I am young, pretty, and healthy. In the last two and a half weeks, all you did was leave space for better things to come in.

I thought that everyone in this subreddit needs to be aware of what sadness is and why we feel it:

""When we lose someone, there is a space where there once was something. We feel as if there is something missing in our lives, and for many of us, there is. This is why we feel sad over loss.

But sadness is a helpful thing. Don't be afraid to be sad. The reason we feel sad is because it takes our energy inward and makes us focus on what's going on inside of us, and we call this a form of depression.

It is totally ok and normal to be sad. Do not fight your emotions, it is a totally necessary part of this process.

Don't be afraid of your emotions. The only way to change them is to simply let them flow through you. Accept your sadness as a way for your mind to bring itself back to peace, either from a therapist or a trusted friend/family member. Not to say you can't seek help right now, but what I really want you to take away is that you cannot run from your emotions. They are built in survival mechanisms that help us, they don't hurt us.""",,False,,False,t3_pk76g

Like everyone else here I used to come here while going through the hardest part of my breakup

After some time I found myself coming here less and here then stopped all together

So I just wanted to share some thoughts about how I to cope with some things. Please don't take this as me saying thats how things works


**From the moment you get the news that it is over:**

This will without a doubt shatter your world, there will be questions and tears and you will most probably become completely irrational in your actions in your words. 

The key is to isolate yourself for a bit and to deal with it

Its okay if you cried and begged your ex not to leave you, and by that I mean turn yourself into a some kind of cyborg without a heart which is crucial for the next step

**If you live with your ex**

This is not easy, you need to prove that you can stand on your own two feet and not just become a vegetable, for yourself and in the eyes of your ex, they need to know how it will be without you and somewhat impress them that you can do it.


You want to be strong and you want to show that you are capable of taking care of yourself. Do not get me wrong, do whats necessary, search everyday and visits everyday. Your ex will be distracting you during the process but I can't stress enough how important it is to realize that this is now business and you need to protect your primary asset (your ass), and your living situation is something that should become a priority. While this is not fun it is important because this will allow you to become independent and growing into the best person you want to be.


Sometimes there are some sexual tensions

**Feelings**

I don't even know where to start, you feel like the time spent together was a waste and you see your future as something nothing short of just empty and black. But things will get clearer and clearer everyday, it will not be overnight but the cloud that is blinding you from any happiness will slowly start to fade away and you will be able to stop the pain eventually. 

You have so many questions to ask your ex, its going to be a whirlpool of emotions and thats okay, but you have to identify them and classify them. 

You have questions, insecurities etc.. thats normal, take the answers to satisfy that part of you that needed them but do not take them at face value (dont dwell on them, whether you trust you are being told the truth or not, it doesnt matter) your primary goal should still remain focusing on yourself and on getting yourself back together, learn to just drop it. 


I know for example that when I am at work, impulsive anger or just being emotional which often resulted in breaking NC and regretting it, so I make a mental note to never trust my judgement while at work.

 Consequently I often find I have my most rational thoughts while in the shower (rational does not mean necessarily happy



Dealing with the fact that you lost your best friend, yes you shared everything but you were growing apart, communication and trust were gone, think about it as two persons trying to communicate while being on different frequencies, its just not gonna happen. 

However, both of you made mistakes, and you both probably have regrets, now is the time to ""grow"" into a better person and define yourself, rebuild your values and priorities. Even if you wish to one day go get back together it is still important to let the other person alone so they can think about themselves and their mistakes and who they want to be as a person.


It is very hard to not be sad about the fact that you can no longer share things with you ex, they will help you greatly dealing with the breakup. Share books, videogames, music, funny links with them. 

Once you suppress the urge to want to share something with your ex then everything will become MUCH easier. Put the focus back on yourself and on surrounding yourself with cool info. Which brings us to

**Focusing on yourself**

Everybody says this, work on yourself. It sounds like a broken record but it is so true. You need to cut contact, block their facebook, you do not want to know what they are up to plus you might misinterpret lots of things which will lead to more fight and more emotional pain. block them, unsubscribe from their friends, if you have any accounts together like netflix, cut it all out. You should not feed your desire to know


You also need to become the person you always dreamed on becoming, its important to remember who you wanted to be when you grew up, what your passions were and the career that you wanted and the way you wanted to look. Being in a relationship can be draining, you focus solely on it and you lose track of yourself, thats why sometimes breakups can be a blessing, it can be that kick the ass that YOU needed whether its career wise or as a person.

Working out really helps

Surround yourself with things you like, a book/comic to read, things to clean, jobs to look into, blogs to discover, start bookmarking interesting websites, watching a new show or more movies, so start somewhere because possibilities are endless. 
Even if its just writing down emotions or thoughts, lists of things I wish to accomplish, things I need to get done this week, anything that I think I need to get done in order to be happy and become the person I dream on becoming)



Accepting that it is over sounds harsh, use that anger to prevent yourself from contacting them, being angry will remind you of why it did not work and it will allow you to not even want to contact them. Over time the anger goes away and you won't even care anymore, but never forget why it didnt work, you have morals and you have values, dont let anybody take them away from you. There is a fine line between being forgiving and naive, make sure you are not being stepped on


I am myself still dealing with my breakup but I made progress, I get to customize everything around me to be to my liking, wear what I want, come home at any time, it took me a while but I finally came to the conclusion that too many things were said and done for this to ever work, and I don't mean this in a pessimistic way but in a realistic way, I am not saying it can never work but it just cannot work at the moment, it set me back emotionally, it was because I was missing connecting with him and talk about things


Also, wondering if you should start hooking up with people or not, often triggered by the fact that you want to get back to your ex, prove to yourself that you have moved on, or show them you are doing well, but if this is not something that you are actually ready for or really want, do not do it

Personally I haven't seen anyone or hooked up with anyone since my breakup (its been 7 months) and I don't feel like I am nowhere ready to get intimate with someone, there is no pressure whatsoever. Before any decisions you make always ask yourself ""Am I doing this for myself or am I actually trying to get back to my ex?"" if the latter, then don't do it.


I can't lie about the fact that what I am scared the most is about finding out he is dating again, good on him for finding someone who can deal with his crazy shit cause I sure cant fucking deal with it and it will for sure not be because of the lack of trying. That goes without saying that there is a part of me that is hoping they will realize how good they might have had it before.



I hope this helped some of you.

When you think of your past love; you may view it as a failure; but when you find a new love, even if their happiness means that you're not apart of it. Everything happens for a reason and for its best. If the person you love doesn't love you back, don't be afraid to love someone else again, for you'll never know unless you give it a try. 

You'll never truly love a person, to help you grow. Don't find love, let love find you; that's why it's called falling in love, because you don't need to force yourself to love, you just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing the chapters. If you want to move on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages. 

Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. But why is it that the greatest irony of love is letting go when you want to hold on, you remember why you held on for so long. **Sometimes you have to forget what you want and remember what you deserve.**

To love is to risk rejection

How to define love: Fall but do not stumble. Be constant but not too persistent. Share and never be unfair. Understand and try not to demand. Hurt but never keep the pain. 

Love is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes the things that give you joy can also hurt you in the end. Loving people means giving them the freedom; whom they choose to be and where they choose to go. Loving someone means giving them the freedom to find their way

Love can be a painful risk. To love means that risk must be taken, if you're not ready to take the risk and if you're not ready to feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in love.""",,False,,t5_2ra79,,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/vk73r/love/

However

So

Here was my big mistake: I shut everyone out of my life except for him. I was so focused on winning him back that I forgot about the many, but I didn't feel so alone.

I've been feeling horrible for a good three months about this. My ex put me through emotions I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I was the most miserable I've been since my parents divorce years ago.

However, and told me some things I didn't want to hear (won't go into it, but let's just say they involved other people). I was sad after they left, but...I suddenly realized that I wanted to be better. I chose to be happier.

And, flirted with other people, got my hair done, and successfully planned a full corporate party. And since I've been focusing on myself, I haven't been thinking about them. I've been thinking about MY happiness. And when they do cross my mind, I remember how happy I am, and wonder why I put myself through that unhappiness for so long. 

Remember, happiness will come and you'll be much better off. I keep telling myself the right person will come along, and when they do, this kind of unhappiness won't happen. 

So

-Don't shut others out of your life. They're there to help you.
-Focus on yourself. Do things you like. Sooner or later
-Don't waste your time on someone who keeps you as an option. You are a priority.
-Go OUT! Even though I didn't have any intention of going home or dating any of the people at the bars/coffee houses/etc
-You CAN choose to be happy. You just have to be brave enough to do so.
-You don't deserve 'no's and 'maybe's. You deserve an absolute 'yes'. :)

My ex wasn't and isn't a horrible person. He just made some poor choices dealing with me. Don't attack your ex: I did, it will. Focus on yourself, and not on your ex's problems or shortcomings.

Long ass summary ahead.

**Where I've been:**
3 months is a lot of time to think about what happened and that would be true if I had spent as much time thinking about 'what' happened, we had a super fantastic relationship, and there was no warning.. I mean there was no warning before the warning.. so to speak. I got the ""lets take a break"" request out of the blue. That was my first warning. It was also the quick slide to everything ending. To be sure, this went from amazing, to over, extremely quick. So mostly over the last 3 months, I have just missed her. I 'think' I am still in love with her, and while she has broken it, but for many reasons. Life goes on


**What I have learned:**
First, and I have NO idea who you even are. That's not a bad thing. All of you in one way or another, have played a role in my life.. even if it was just a few typewritten words, you have helped.


I've also learned through analysis, I have come to realize that my ex, is a broken person. I KNEW this going into the relationship, but I didn't KNOW it to be a constant. There was nothing I could trend out, and unfortunately, I thought it would be different with us. Isn't that what we all think? I was naive, and made a very poor decision in taking on the relationship. One that I will regret forever. Trust me when I say this is not because she left me. This is because it's true


**How I am doing now:** 
I have lots of good days, which is generally pretty solid, took a beating, but I am slowly working on getting it back. I no longer hold out hope that we will get back together, which is good I guess. Things are starting to fade, and turn gray. I have more anger for what she did to me, than sadness. Which is also good. At this moment, upbeat person


**Where I am going:**
This girl I have known for a year or so, I understand the tragic irony of this) and we have been seeing each other for the last few months. It's been amazing.. really, it has. Though it has done nothing to help me get over my ex, and that's actually not what I am asking of it. To be honest, I am not sure what my feelings for her are, or if they even exist. She is in the same boat, but we continue to float on. I have no real expectations for where this is going. It could be over in a day, month.. who knows. Maybe it will never end. Bottom line


**My fears:**
3 months in, inevitable things like dating someone else, marrying someone else, having the kids we were supposed to have. I fear all of this. I hope in time I can accept it, but acceptance will come at the cost of great pain, that is for certain.


**My Hopes:**
That I move on to a happier, and work for it, then I am certain that it will happen.

you'll get a teeny bit stronger. You need to get occupied mostly

last year i went through the same thing you guys are going through.
im fucking awesome now... ive never had this much confidence in my entire life. the breakup might have been the greatest thing to happen to me

take as long as you need to grieve.. but give yourself a time limit.
the longer you wait in this grieving period

do things that make your life better... 
1) exercise is a must.. i dont care who you are and what your body type is.  dont sit there rolling your eyes at me.. stop feeling sorry for yourself and get your heart pumping. you will feel a lot better.
2) take up a hobby you never had the guts to take... spend some money if you have to.. spoil yourself... 


there are a lot of things you can do get over a breakup.. just realize you will be better one day.. and in the history of life
take comfort knowing we all have been there

goodluck! live long and prosper...

and if there any canadian girls in here that need a shoulder to cry on ;) LOL.. sorry!

I still think

I remember the day we had our disastrous first date. And of course I remember that magical second date where we had our first kiss on a sidewalk that snowy night...how invincible I felt at that moment, how we would hang out at your place...I still think about our all night phone calls every Saturday.

I realize after our breakup that you no longer are the person that I fell for. That person is long gone. You're so callous towards me now...its something I've been trying to be myself towards you but its impossible for me...so I just avoid you, kiss you, call your name and tell you how much I love you...but I know I cannot do that, because I quickly realize I do not love you, I never loved you, I loved someone else, someone who no longer exists. So my mind knows what my heart is afraid to accept

So I [24 year old Male] had been dating this girl, so I ask who it is? And she confesses to me that that this is a man who wanted to offer her a job as a prostitute. soo... yeah.

My first thought was that it wall all a joke, and would be like cheating and such. and promises me that she will never talk to that man again. And I, like a fool bought into it.

so things were strained by this

fast forward to the beginning of this month. She just graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelors in evolutionary anthropology

As a bit of a gift to herself she decided to go backpacking around Puerto Rico, ill take the 16 off and we will make a day out of it. She tells me she cant, and for a day and a half she wouldn't tell me why. 

Eventually, and that she will be back on the 28th but if they make her a good offer she will stay the entire summer, but that she was treating it like a 2 week free vacation. So I'm skeptical as fuck, but i remember when we first started dating she applied to the place. So once again I decide to trust her.

So her laptop has been having a few issues

I was working and had to delete a file. so I opened up the trash to get rid of it. And low and behold there are a bunch of naked pictures. all of her with her lip piercing witch she got while we were dating. And this is the first time I have ever seen any of them. So I track them back to where they came from

A little bit more digging and i find a post from her on there forums. Jessabell is the name she picked for herself. and there are a few of the pictures that were lying in her trash. posted up for the world to see in a thread she had created as an application to become a legal prostitute...

Anyways I sat on this information for a good week, I asked her where she was going the next day, ""Arizona"" she said. ""Jess don't lie to me, where are you going tomorrow?"". Once again she said ""Arizona, camp shane"", ""So than why is your name on a list of girls that will be working at this bunny ranch on the 16th?"". So she finally tells me that she was lying to me. So I tell her I never want to see or hear from her again. And in the most monotone voice, she just says ""Ok"" and walks away. no emotion what so ever.

6 months of my time

I was so pissed that she just walked away, some 22 year old girl who was kicked out of amry ROTC for depression, and still taking pills for it, was running off to become a Prostitute. Part of me that still cared for her wanted to beg her not to go, but there was nothing else i could do at that point, she had already broken the only promises she had ever made to me, and than lied about it on top of that. 

Anyways I feel better getting this all down in words

TL;DR girlfreind runs off to Nevada to become a prostitute. lies to cover it up.

I received the ""can we talk tonight"" text while at work on Friday. My heart sank to the floor because I knew what was coming. I dropped everything to find a secluded space in my office building to have what would be the same conversation that I've had two times before. I would profess that we keep trying and she would tell me that she no longer can.

We had a trip planned with my family to Mexico in two weeks. My parents decided to take my sister and I as well as our SO's to Mexico (first actual family trip ever) for some fun in the sun to break up the winter doldrums. On top of that we had finally started to plan on moving in together after 5 years!

Now we've had a troubled past

Year 1:
I had just came out of a terrible relationship with a woman who had so much baggage it was impossible to survive. I tried for almost three years to be her rock

I had just started a job at an art supply store after college with one of my buddies. When I went into the interview I saw the girl that would be my everything for the next 5 years. Lets call her ""B"". She was so light and happy that I couldn't help but be drawn to her. We would make eyes at each other every time we were in the same room. It didn't take long before we went on our first of many dates. Now while I was totally digging her I also felt guilty about essentially replacing my previous girlfriend with this high on life 21 year old. But it felt so good

Year 2:
At this point we are head over heels for one another

Year 3:
She turns 23, and a new birth control pill making our sex life lack the luster it once had, the boat begins to rock. She doesn't know what she wants, and she is scared. I do my best to comfort her, I don't push with my frustration of the lack of intimacy because I didn't want to be the over-bearing boyfriend that begs for sex. I try and be patient, and do romantic things for her hoping to reignite a spark. But I feel her becoming distant, and in the coming weeks she ends it.

I'm a wreck, my sad sap texts turn into angry rants. But this only pushes her further.

So during the following month I try my best to go NC

I see her at a concert one night. My buddy decides to drag me out of the house like every good buddy should. I see her with someone else

I proceed to send emails in the coming days asking all the questions that I don't want to know the answers to. She denies her new relationship is anything more than friends

Then the next guy pops up on her wall. I see she posts pictures of them at an apple orchard (one of our fall traditions) and it hit me hard.
We have countless conversations about us

At this point I'm a career man, and for the first time in over a month and a half I was feeling good. It was a great confidence boost.

We went on a few dates before ""B"" caught wind of us. She had a realization (more likely became jealous) and wanted me back. We met up one night and talked about everything and what had been happening during the last month of NC. She admitted that her ""friend"" wanted more, she was confused because we were having such a nice time with one another. I told her I was going to give ""B"" another shot, and she reluctantly accepted.

We were back! Having passionate and amazing sex, especially having thought those fantasy's would never be a reality again. She said she would never do this to us again, and that she wants only me until the end of time. I had a wall up still, but hearing her say those things that I waited so long to hear made it come crumbling down. I had my girl back.

Now it was her turn to cut her guy free (lets call him ""J""). She seemed reluctant considering it was her idea. She told me she had sent him an email

This would be the cancer of our relationship. And would also reveal a giant red-flag that I never should have gotten past.

I got into her email and saw what she wrote to him. She told him that she didn't know if she was doing the right thing

So at this point instead of raising a fuss about her seemingly reluctant breakup email with ""J"" I decided to just keep snooping like a creep. She says that they have cut contact and that it is over, and this further fuels my need to snoop and find out what is really going on. Our re-united honey moon has started to fade now that I've become so crazy with the developing secrets between us. 

Its become a drug to snoop at this point, even though I know in doing so I have to admit to breaking her privacy and snooping through all of her emails like a crazy fuck. But I need to know what the hell is going on, so I pull the trigger.

She becomes super defensive, I would not let her turn the table on me because in my mind what I did was the lesser of the two evils. She told me that ""C"" was just a Internet pen-pal that she has had since she was 15, and that they were never inappropriate with each other while we were dating. She said she sent him the picture out of a moment of insecurity, having just broken up with me. I thought it was fucking weird that shes had a pen-pal for 8 years that she told no-one about, especially me. So shit is hitting the fan everywhere, and we are a mess. I've almost forgotten about the ongoing communication with ""J"" at this point, having been blindsided by this new information. I tell her that if we are to be together that she has to cut ties with these people. And she reluctantly agrees.

So we try and carry on, she was still communicating with these guys. Nothing flirty, pretty innocent on her end actually, but that didn't matter, she said she wasn't going to anymore and now she is. I try and catch her in a lie instead of throwing myself under the bus again. ""So have those guys still been trying to talk to you?"" Her: ""No"" Me: ""Are you sure?"" Her: ""Yes"" BOOM. I tell her i looked through her phone, and she becomes irate that I once again violated her privacy, and I'm fuming because I caught her in a lie. This happens a few more times

Gross huh?

This routine lasts a couple months, trying to get her to come back to me, to give us another chance. Its her birthday in a few days and I spent most of my last two paychecks on a new camera for her. I was so excited to give it to her on her Birthday, but she was already gone. I call her on her birthday and don't get any answers, I remember laying in my depressing apartment at the time like the saddest piece of shit you can imagine. The morning comes and I'm miserable, I drag myself to work knowing that it would be another long day. Then in the afternoon I get a text, its her, she contacted me?! We talk and I can tell that she misses me... I'm so happy that she's initiating conversation without me berating her with texts. I tell her I still want to make things work, so we re-unite. The passion has come back and I'll do anything to keep this girl.

A week goes by and I start to doubt that she only kissed this guy, that it was a mistake. I'm crushed, and at a complete loss. I tell her to leave so that I can think, she texts me in the following days, texts that I would have given anything to receive just days before. I felt like I would be a total chump if I let her back in, but as the days past I caved in and let her back into my life...again.

We got through it, forcing myself to forgive and forget. To not visualize the act that spun over and over again in my mind. To believe that it wasn't planned and that it only happened once, and that it meant nothing, and that it wouldn't ever happen again. It killed so much, but we were broken up right? right?? (Writing this paragraph makes me feel so stupid)

Long Year huh?

Year 4:
Man we have come through some shit! Has it made us stronger? Am I fighting for the best relationship of my life or am I just fighting for the fight at this point? Are we just torturing ourselves? 

Social Networking:
We have gone through so much and are in a fragile state. Facebook starts to cause problems in our already problematic relationship. She is still facebook friends with all of those ""friends"" that she has been involved with during our break-ups. I would get jealous when those ""ghosts"" from the past would pop up on a feed or like something that she posted. We had lots of stupid arguments and then came to the realization that we should just delete our accounts while we were still trying to re-build our trust. Done, unless they were still trying to make plays. So we cut it all off, no more social networking. No snooping no nothing. I decide to just trust her instead of police her and have faith that nothing was going on behind my back. It was a relief.

The next two years are bliss. I stop snooping completely. We go on vacations, how we should take the next step and move in together. We'd spend at least 5 nights out of the week together, just the two of us. We go to concerts, out to dinner, art museums etc. We start saving up for the next trip we are going to take together. Everything is perfect. Well almost everything... the sex had started to dwindle, and when we did have it, it became a routine. Granted we generally both got off, but after 5 years I realized that sex is kind of a roller coaster. Some months we had lots of sex

Her 26 Birthday approaches and I want to make it special. I contact her best friend and asked her to help me get a hold of her other friends via facebook (because we were still facebook free 2 years later). She does and we have 15 people confirmed to have a great time celebrating her birthday. We go back and forth planning all the different things to do and who all to invite, you mind if we just go out to dinner and then cuddle on the couch?"" (our routine). ""Not at all"" I say, in fact that sounds great to me (thinking to myself). So her b-day arrives and I give her her presents and take her out to sushi, and do everything in my power to make her night great, but she is in a poor mood all night. She just kind of sulks through it all. Doesn't want B-day sex, doesn't want much of anything. I give her a nice long massage and just figured she wasn't in the mood.

A couple of days pass and we get into the age old social networking argument. She is now friends with all of her past ""friends"" on Instagram (her only social networking site), I reiterate that I just don't see the point, especially given our past. Why re-open wounds? And yeah at this point I feel like a possessive piece of shit.

At this point the switch flips, and my heart sinks, once again forgetting about why the argument started and instead just trying to keep her from throwing everything away...again. We both shed tears, and in my heart I realized that the end was nearing. With our trip to Mexico just three weeks away, the pressure was on. We ended up getting into the weeds, and I think we both knew what was coming. We were both so nauseous that we stopped just short of breaking up, and decided we couldn't keep talking about it. We ended up going out for a much needed bite and then back to my place where we tried to continue our conversation. Once again we hit a wall and just agreed to not talk about it for the night. 

The next day she comes over again, and to not be afraid of hurting me if she thinks its best. She said no, i want to keep trying, and so we made plans on how to get through it all. We held each other for the rest of the night, both seeming relieved that we had somehow dodged our fate. I woke in the morning to her giving me kisses as she left for work and I was relieved that we were still on the same page.

The following week we tried to act normal

The End:
A couple of nights go by without seeing each other, talking about our up and coming trip to Mexico and reconnecting. On our way to the shop I offered to go back to my place to ""reconnect"". She was uninterested, and I didn't press. So she dropped me off at the car shop gave me what would be our last kiss and told me she loved me. I watched her drive away thinking ""hey we'll get there again"".

That was the last time I saw her, all the battles we have fought along the way that I would be prepared for the end, but I wasn't. She's gone again, and I don't have anything left in me.

I don't know if this will be useful to anyone but this is my story and it's both painful and freeing to write it down. I'm 35 years old and every major relationship, I've failed to stand up for myself, to draw a line and say that it's not something I want to have in my life. I've been the quintessential doormat. Until now. This is my life and I call the shots now.

**My Childhood**

I grew up in a small religious cult in a big city. My story goes the same way that a stereotypical cult story would go. If I were to tell you the details of my childhood, lies and sexual abuse. I'll spare you though. It's enough to know that it happened and as you can image was pretty damaging.

I have 5 brothers and sisters. The oldest three, but it was hidden from the world and hidden from ourselves. It has had enormous ripple effects that last to this day. I remember the complete meltdown of the cult when everything came out. The cult leader was ousted (but never arrested, charged or has had to otherwise pay for his moral and legal crimes). My father had completely abandoned his role as a protector, turning over all his responsibility to the cult leader. Looking back, I remember my abuser more clearly than my own father. From the onset, my parents taught us to give everything away, including things that are necessary for our own happiness. 

**Early Adulthood**

I married my ex-wife at a very young age. I had just come back home from a stint in the military and she knew exactly what to say to get my attention. She was insecure and very good at emotional manipulation. Unfortunately, put aside my own self and devoted myself to making a good marriage, one where she wouldn't feel the need to do that to me ever again. Six years later, she cheated with her boss, so I left her, intending to finally end it. I came crawling back 2 months later. I lost myself in the marriage but I hung on anyway. My marriage finally ended after 12 years in August 2011 after she had a full blown affair with her best friend husband. Throughout it all, I kept ignoring my instincts and my gut and let her lie to me. I let her define my reality. It was too painful to handle

If you're curious

**Post Marriage**

After I ended the marriage, cheat or disrespect me like that. 

Yet, it was very infrequent and that she cherished me more than any drug. I had no reason to doubt her at that point so I took her word for it while telling her it wasn't something I was comfortable with having in my life. She promised she would stop.After the conversation, I felt glad she was honest enough to tell me. It encouraged me because it felt like it was a healthy conversation.

But, her responses were perfect and made me feel that it was just residual stuff from my failed marriage (and the crappy way it ended). Nevertheless, I struggled with feeling like she was hiding things so I used my highly develop skill of denial to ignore it. I ignored my instincts and by extension, turned over my own well-being to another person.

It didn't work very well because nothing changed and I begin to feel that she really was lying to me. I started pushing for the truth and her responses changed to where she was not just lying, turning my accusations and suspicions into something that was monstrously unfair, saying that I was hurting her by not trusting her. She manipulated me into feeling bad about questioning her.Even though I knew the relationship was killing me, I continued. It's what I know, after all.

I posted on r/relationships an embarrassingly number of times, that was an enormous failing on my part. I was empty, weak and let her continue to lie to me. She had no real reason to stop and every reason to keep doing the things that hurt us. I'm not excusing her actions, I'm taking responsibility for my role in allowing that to happen.

Here are some of the more choice posts:. These are all me.

**Now**

I found the strength to leave her yesterday morning. We had a nice New Years Eve until she got completely and utterly wasted at a party we went to. I knew then, but it wouldn't matter anyway. She was a different person. Outgoing, flirtatious and even joyous.

At 3am, but it took forever because hey, it's New Years Eve, everybody needs a taxi. My phone battery died so I had to use hers. While waiting to get through the busy signal, I saw that she had recently deleted most of her texts but despite clearing her history, I saw that just a few days ago she had been arranging to meet her best friend (the same guy who ALWAYS has drugs) in a nearby town to go shopping with her.This bothered me because she never mentioned meeting up with him. She said she wanted to run out for a bit to go shopping (the truth) but left out the very important part of hanging out with her friend. Was she going to buy or do some coke? I don't know, but it means that even now, she was going to keep hiding her intentions and actions. I also saw that as recently as a few weeks ago, drank heavily

I sent her a goodbye note last night, nor do I want to be one. This isn't me. I can no longer allow someone who says they love me to lie and attempt to manipulate me. It's something I would never do to someone I truly loved. It's true that we all lie, we all cover up, we all manipulate but it's matter of degree and length and what the lies are intended to hide. I think I know what her reasons are. She has addiction issues. It's hard, I know. I have them too.I don't know how serious it is and I don't know the extent of what that's led to while we dated (I don't want to know), but it just doesn't matter anymore. I don't care about what the ""truth"" is. I care about taking care of myself. I don't need to catch her lying. I don't need to feel justified in breaking up. I was justified a long time ago.

It also doesn't matter how much I loved my girlfriend (who I loved with all my heart). If I'm being taken advantage of

Taking responsibility for my failings also means I need to recognize that I didn't handle my (justified) angry reactions to the lies and manipulation. I could have fostered a more open and supportive environment to talk about the problems between us. I suspect it would not have made a difference but I should have been better nevertheless. I won't pretend that I'm NOT angry. I am. The different is that I'm going to fix it

Ultimately, just the reality as I see it. I feel good about what I wrote. I wanted to be kind and I sincerely hope she understands that someday.

&gt;[Redacted]
Against my better judgement, but I won't be replying. I care a very great deal for you and continuing to talk would simply hurt too much. As hard as it is, my decision is final. Much of what I'll say here won't be a surprise to you but I think it's important I say it anyway.

&gt;This is entirely about trust and I have none left. I've been completely consumed by trying to keep myself invested in our relationship when really

&gt;It's hard not to take it personally, I'm not going to accuse you of anything. I'm just explaining why I can't continue with you. I'm just going to use one example from May.

&gt;I recently went back to my email's gtalk chat archive and re-read your response when I confronted you about buying drugs for your friend [redacted].

&gt;Of course, that I wasn't ready for another relationship, that you were heart broken and I was being completely unfair. You then inferred it was impossible for you to regain my trust. This was in May. Re-reading the chat made me feel manipulated and played, [redacted]. I'm not going to make any assumption about it being sub-conscious or not, but it doesn't matter.

&gt;I cannot accept that from a person who says they love me

&gt;The thing that kills me is that you have so much to offer [redacted]. We have a great connection

&gt;I debated about providing the comfort of a relationship to help you

&gt;In addition, until now. That alone was not good for me and it wasn't good for you. I fully accept that blame for that.

&gt;[redacted], but I didn't get the best of you. You aren't getting the best of yourself, either, and that has to be something you do. 

&gt;Whatever motivations or reasons are behind it

&gt;I don't know what else to say. I'm not angry at you, I have nothing bad to say about you. I loved what we did have and I appreciate all the wonderful things you DID do for me. They meant a lot to me.


**The End**

Here's to 2013 and to the rest of my life. My own life. Love the way that sounds!

Ask yourself these questions: What do you miss about your ex?  Specifically

Here are my answers:  
&gt; What do I miss the most about her?  The sensation of snuggling with her.    It made me feel loved

Pick the emotional state that means the most to you.  For me it would be ""valued"".  Ask yourself ""how does it feel when I am [emotional state]?""

Imagine that emotional state as vividly as you can.  Can you imagine how it feels?  If not

Now

With this tactic you now have the ability to feel any emotional state you want

It's very easy to blame yourself and tell yourself you're worthless after a breakup. You get into a slump because you were validating yourself with another person and they didn't want you

If you actually start by looking at yourself and saying, start looking after yourself better, take vitamins, dress nicely and you will start respecting yourself more and then you get to a better place.

1359988373.0,17v8cc,My (still) broken heart - excruciatingly honest account of my (26F) feelings nine months post breakup   ,annakarenina85,28,2,12," Nine months. A full period of human gestation. It seems impossible to consider that I could have grown a complete human being in this time

Though I wish you weren’t, you’re in the library I hide in to study (read: procrastinate, and yep – you’re in that too), you’re on the streets I stroll down with the necessary-but-not-sufficient men I vainly use to forget you, you’re in the medical school curriculum I peruse, you’re in the journal articles that I read, you’re on the buses that I catch, each night when I sleep you are in my dreams. You’re everywhere but at the same time – every experience, with someone elses – moved on, sleeping

Sometimes my negative certainties even extend back to the actual you-and-me world – they whisper to my most insecure self, how you kissed me, how delighted you were to see me or hear my voice, how you told me that you didn’t have a care in the world when I was in your arms, that you loved me more than you’d ever loved anyone before (although when we were over you added the caveat of ‘so far’).

I know it’s too much to hope that you think of me and feel a pang of missing me, something may occasion you to think of some happy moment with me, causing you to smile.

I know that I should want good things for you –that I should hope that you find a pretty and interesting girl, I want that girl to be me.

If I thought it would do any good at all I would compile a dissertation with graphs and statistics and logical constructions on why you should come back to me. On why we, enough data points – that you made a decision based on an incomplete analysis. I want to believe that if only I can find the right words and arrange them in the right order and pair them with the right diagrams that I can convince you. That you didn’t really stop loving me. That you just cauterised that part of your heart, subjugated it to ill-reasoned arguments about ‘different relationship styles’ and ‘life schedule clashes’, and that with the right words I can redirect the blood flow and resurrect the dead tissue and you will remember how much you loved me and how happy we were. But the rational part of my brain knows that that approach, like this outpouring of emotion, would be terrifying to you. Off-putting. Cringe-worthy. Awkward. Because you don’t love me anymore. Not even slightly. I know I should feel embarrassed. I mean, I should have felt embarrassed after the first desperate, let alone the second or third. Love really does just make you crazy and foolish and ridiculous.

I’ve heard that you won’t get over somebody until you completely accept that it’s over. I think I have accepted it, lurking in the background, but to borrow a phrase from Bukowski - for a moment they didn’t have me by the throat. I am terrified that I will love you until the sun sets in the east and rises in west.

You will never read this – or if by some sick twist of fate you (a) stumble across it on the internet and (b) actually care to read the whole thing… you will never identify it as being written by me or pertaining to you – but I swear that I will write this out and carry it around with me forever in a sealed envelope – and if I ever see you again I will give it to you,False,,t5_2ra79,1360161159.0,,,t3_17v8cc

I've been reading stuff here on /r/breakups ever since I discovered it just after my breakup. I've received a lot of inspiration from like minded folks who've also had love snatched away from them. I posted about my breakup last year from a throwaway account. I don't have a link to prove it

**DOES IT GET BETTER?**
The answer to that, I genuinely felt that I am better off without my ex, while on other days, it tortured me to think that I'll not have her around anymore. Being a more emotionally inclined person, I had more painful days where I moped about how I'd love to have her back and take care of her and have her love me back. From that point of view, I'm not even a single percent healed, as I still feel every bit of the pain and sorrow as I did that night. I've cried myself to sleep countless number of times, or some expectation of contact from her side

**TRIGGERS
The smallest of things have started impacting me the most. Things that a regular person wouldn't note. However, a feeling of desparation, and just out and out pain overcomes me everytime something triggers my memory into thinking of her.

**MAINTAINING NO CONTACT**
Perhaps my biggest folly over this one year has been the fact that I've been very weak in maintaining no contact. Even when I've personally made up my mind not to contact my ex, or that my self respect has been diminished so much ever since getting dumped, that I've partly ceded control of my actions to her. She's called me when she's needed me, even said that she still loves me on multiple occasion, and then gone back to being cold and heartless the very next day. I've felt used, manipulated, and emotionally abused. I've doubted and hated myself millions of times, without paying any semblance of attention to what I was doing to myself.

**TERTIARY MISDEEDS**
I picked up smoking, another thing that I'd never done before. Luckily for me, I've now sworn off of smoking ever since 2013 started, and have been good with it and honest to myself thus far. But the fear of another relapse always lingers on.

**HOW DO I FEEL?**
Alone.
Abused.
Distrustful.
Lonely.
Afraid.
Doubtful about myself.
Quiet.
Shy.
Hurt.
I still cry myself off to sleep every now and then. I still dream about her. I still itch to text/call her (but don't anymore). I know that if she wants to come back

**AM I STILL IN LOVE WITH HER?**
Yes.

**WHY THIS WALL OF TEXT?**
Because I just want to let out all the feelings somewhere. I can't talk to friends as I feel like I've burdened them enough. My family doesn't get the point of how hard this is on me (especially considering it was 5 years long, but I feel people out her can use a little of my experience at least to help them through the rough times. I'm sorry if none of this relevant.

I'll try to make this quick. My [21/f] ex dumped me [21/m] eight weeks ago after what I consider

Now I've been posting and checking up here every day, and this community has really been awesome. I've learned a lot. I initiated NC immediately, blocked her facebook after a few weeks, and haven't spoken to her at all aside from some awkward hello's in passing on campus.

Things are so much better! I'm taking care of myself now, as of right now, I'm just immersing myself in my school work, and I'm happy :)

But there's some demons I'm still having a hard time with, what she'd say to me, and the questions I'd ask her if we ever sat down for a Coffee Talk. I have these conversations with myself maybe 10 times a day, and they come and go, like I said, for a few minutes, and then they pass after a few moments of me reciting some of the burning questions I've had. Is this normal

And if it's of any importance

* Why did you lead so many guys on without telling them you were dating me?
* What are some things that I may have done to contribute to the end of the relationship? (Because honestly
* Were you being honest when you said x

And then every once in a while I'll think about the good times we shared. Maybe once every few days. And maybe once a day I'll think about some of the hurtful things she started doing at the end of the relationship, but fortunately I've gotten better at not being bothered at that sort of thing.

Now, but I think it's time for me to start moving on from here.

Anyways

I don't feel lonely.  I don't think I have ever felt lonely in my life.  I can't even comprehend what that even means.  Even if I am alone for extended periods I can still hang out with myself

* Things are better when I pursue what I want out of life.
* I can't be around people that I don't want to be around or that act like they don't want to be around me

* It's true that if you feel like you don't love someone then you just don't.
* Don't make excuses for other people even if they have brain problems.  They should be able to cope.
* If someone breaks up with you in year 3 by saying they want to sleep with other guys don't try to save the relationship.  It will die.
* Life is not set.  You make your own path.
* If someone is telling you that you have some sort of disorder
* Your parents relationship will not define your relationship.  Different times
* If you have to choose between relationship and career
* Hold on to your own beliefs/morals and don't adopt others just because you want to fit in.
* If you feel like your SO wants to break up with you but doesn't have the guts to do it or even talk to you about it... Break up with them.  It will save you a headache.
* Don't be miserable or in a dirty unkempt sloppy state just because you want to relate with someone.
* If your SOs family puts pressure on you to stay with them... don't listen to that BS.  They do not know the majority of the story and its really none of their business.


I am happier and post breakup has actually been pretty awesome.  There is still some awkwardness floating around with mutual friends.  Its pretty easy to navigate though.

I had been with a girl for over two years through some combination of dating and hooking up. Out of the blue she broke up with me and like many of you I was destroyed. All I could think about was what went wrong and all the things I could have done to change what happened. After a while I took the very same advice many of you get here; let it go

There is a reason that advice is given so often. It works. And it worked for me and after a month I was happier with myself than I had ever been. I was eating better, and we had a short but civil talk. The next day I received a series of texts from her that essentially said ""we should be friends with benefits.""

Without thinking I jumped on the opportunity. And things were great for a while

We broke up for a reason. In the time we spent together before the breakup we were being ourselves and we were happy. But people change

That's why I jumped at the opportunity to be back with her. In the end it did nothing to help me though. Without her I had made myself into a better person

When we split again I had none of the feelings associated with the original breakup. I'm not even angry, but there are three girls currently vying for my attention and its due to the fact that I value myself so highly. Being the best person you can be is the ultimate attraction to the opposite sex.

Today I am writing to say that it has been absolutely horrible, you SHOULD feel like you want to reach out and contact them. But THIS WAS NOT THE PERSON. Whether or not you believe it now, the best thing to do is to repeat to yourself that you deserve someone that feels the way you do now, and that this person was not it.

I have cut off all contact and have talked to many many friends (some of whom are going through the same thing). I have drawn inspiration from this subreddit specifically because of the top motivational posts.

Every day I get up and I think about myself, but that's healthy and a GOOD thing because you can feel this way - just not with this person. 

If you have been through a breakup before

Please do not continue being in a relationship that caused you so much pain, affection, sex, fun, and the occasional misunderstanding and even argument (but not at the rate it happened before you broke up).

Please take this time to understand when it went wrong and how to recognize that in the future. You do not want to repeat this with someone you will learn to love in the future (and you will!!!). Take this time to get a new haircut, whatever it is you always wanted to do!

For me, then respond and then talk and everything. BUT I know what will happen if I do that. I put my hand on the hot stove before and I know I can't trust her with my feelings. I am writing this to express that one of the most difficult things now is letting go, but piece by piece I am making that effort and even though I fall into a panic and I become desperate, each time I say ""STOP"" is easier and each time I recognize that I have a lot to focus on because this is *about me* now. There is a person in your life that you need to take care of right now and it's you and they have been neglected because you focused on someone else who did not appreciate it. One day there will be someone who treats you like you treat them and the balance will be struck. That is not today and you have the opportunity to grow and love yourself.

You want to attract someone in the future? Become confident, it was great for a while and now it's over. A new chapter began for you and once you put in enough time to grieve (please let yourself do this, you will soon be sick of it), you will recognize that it was just a person and not something to worship.

One last bit of advice, etc. Now, if you have things that you used to do together that you still want to do - GO DO THEM, soon you will replace your memories with them with new memories that don't have them (and it will be hard, but it WILL happen).

You will be alright

Dear Mr. Starfish:

For a time
 
The details of our story are like everyone's story really. After the break-up I sometimes missed you

It took a while to figure out (and even longer to accept) that we were both keeping each other from growing and becoming the people we were meant to be. 
Okay

You were all-wrong for me, I am a human being with feelings. 

And you

But enough sadness and/or hate. I want you to know that I did stay in my Masters program; I write my thesis in the fall. I teach freshman composition--no words will ever describe the joy I find in my job. 

And I got married.

For a time, put a lot of pressure on you. For that, I apologize. Our relationship was so intense it was sometimes hard to see reason. 

I'm writing this because my husband was helping me organize my junk and he found Starmee, made me think of you. And I thought of fond memories--
rainbow sorbet

I threw Starmee away, too selfish, and too exhausting for its own good. Admittedly, jj would have been devastated; but, she only existed as a product of our imagination. A lot of our relationship existed in our imagination. 

I'm glad it's over. I'm glad because life is good. And I choose this life over any life that we would have undoubtedly faked for one another.

I do hope you're happy. I mean that in earnest. [: 
I hope that you are well and that you can surround yourself with people who love you for what you are

Goodbye Mr. Starfish

Best
JJ

This was back in October and was a very messy, but the trust was gone, and it just was not the same. I knew that it would be the best for both of us to part ways.

A good friend gave me a month's free gym membership

For me, I'm so tired and worn out I fall asleep pretty quickly.

I can't recommend this enough

Obviously it's a long, and those little freckles on his arms and his ridiculous shower singing. Sometimes I even listen to songs that remind me of him on my iPod - and then I sweat out all those memories. I let it hurt and I let myself grieve and feel that gut-wrenching pain, and then I work-out vigourously, and sweat it out of my system. This pain, and everything I learned from the last two years is part of who I am, and will help me to be a better person.

I really hope that you guys who feel the same will try something like this. Reddit has helped me SO much over the last few months

Give it a try :)

1366005170.0,1cdhm2,[18M] Farewell r/BreakUps,AssassinAragorn,27,3,2,"I came to this subreddit when I was still with her, refusing NC and hoping desperately for some magic salve. 

I occasionally came back to to read a post or two

I wanted to impart some advice before I leave here (hopefully for good, you should take it for pain relief, but you shouldn't take it constantly to prevent pain, but change your lifestyle or find a less harmful medicine in the longrun (since aspirin will hurt your digestive system a bit). 

When you feel ready, but not a crutch. Everyone heals differently, and you shouldn't be afraid to stay as long as you want. By all means and certainly, you should. But know that, at some point, you need to go, whether it be weeks or months. Remember, r/BreakUps is going to be pretty gloomy and depressing.

Some other things I've learned: it does get better with time, you hit a plateau, where it just lingers dully. There are days when it feels like you're just a week or two out of the break up, but there are also days where you feel freer than ever, ready to embrace your life and its path in all its fullness.

The key is to move on. I found that I couldn't until I had some closure. When I talked with her, I actually felt at peace. Beforehand, I wanted to constantly talk with her and lie to myself that I was moving on and just trying to be friends. After I had my revelation, I felt rested. I also wanted some time away from her to think and just heal. I can't stress enough how important closure is.

If you had one of those relationships that you felt was perfect in every way (which I did), commit them to memory. Something wasn't meshing, so make note of what was causing it. 

Whatever you do, for better or worse. It holds only pain, and I really, really suggest you don't use it to put a bandage over your wound. Treat your wound with dignity and give it the treatment it deserves.

Lastly, and just being 'around' people helped me feel better. Plus, when I needed to vent and talk about how bad I felt, there were people to listen and to sympathize. If there's one great thing about break ups, it's that everybody's had them. Spending time with irl friends is great too. 

I implore you, and it's helpful. I'm also working on some exercise to try and improve my confidence and body. Having little goals like this are great too. Go on a walk in the park or hike a bit. Just sit next to some trees and talk it out. I personally did the last bit. During a free period in school, I drove down to a huge tree somewhat far from the school and just sat there, and talked. Not only did it feel great to act spontaneously, but it was calming to be alone in nature. I really suggest you try finding a peaceful spot, away from the world, and just working things out and relaxing.

As a final bit, but hold it as a photograph. It's a memory, and treat it as such. You will make plenty of new memories, and you will look back on this fondly, but you'll be glad to be where you are in life.

Take the love that you had and love yourself. Treat yourself to some long warm baths or a nice iced coffee. Sleep in a bit, and it's the worst thing ever, but if we're going to be here, let's make the most of it, because I promise you, you will climb out of this valley into a lush field with mighty mountaintops, and you will be for the better because of all your experiences.

1357057512.0,15rwre,How to cope: Turning yourself off emotionally,edgychic,27,4,9,"Hey guys

I wasn't going to post this

I wanted to discuss a coping mechanism with you and see what your thoughts are. I'm still not sure it's the ideal way of doing things but it is effective. The impact on my sense of humanity and empathy is hard to measure though....


**General idea**:

I've found that I can turn myself off emotionally, which many people here recommend in order to keep busy and move on. When I'm turned off emotionally, I find it easier to focus on challenging tasks and learning things. I'm going to set up a concrete guideline to help prove my point by drawing on my own experience with my former lover.


                                            
events:                (1.a) meet (1.b) sex (2) tells me he's in love 

feelings twd him:   (1.a) friends    (1.b) fwb  (2) love

feelings twd ppl:     (1.a+b) uninvested


(1) **The ""off"" phase**:

So basically, aka, invested a lot of time in improving myself. In fact, now that we're broken up, the things that give me the most consolation is thinking about the awesome new job I'm going to start and all the things I'm going to learn, experience, etc. When I think of these things, I would see people as toys to test out psychological principles. I was like a walking

(2) **The ""emotionally on"" phase

And bam! Shit changes. I see people more as human beings, more self-sacrificing, less analytical and more ""feelingy"". My learning direction changes too. It is less driven by my own initiative and starts to conform to others and to him in particular. I take up his interests and learn them better. I have an unmistakable glow. And to emphasize what an on/off switch this really is, we stayed friends and I didn't have any of these feelings until he told me he was in love the day before I left the country. And that was it, there was no turning back. I was laughing and calling him sappy, but inside things had changed. One second I was happy to put an end to the relationship, accepting that it was a great experience and that all good things had to end. The next second I'm attached to something more eternal, less dependent on time and place, dreams


**Principles**:

- Give yourself some time to cry and then turn yourself off emotionally. This is the best way to move on in my opinion. I realise I end up colder towards other people

- You cannot rush into a new relationship: This requires that you turn yourself on emotionally, and I don't think it's fair to yourself.

- You can have sex with other people

- Enjoy your off-time by rediscovering yourself and your interests and realigning yourself to make sure you're heading in the right direction.

- Seeing the person again: I know everyone is a proponent of the no contact rule, but they have to know you can't give it to them.

- How to practice turning yourself off emotionally: Once again, and as a sweater. Stare at it until all you see is an old sweater.


**Reservations about the method**: 

- Evolving beyond your ""me"": I don't necessarily think being ""me"" is as important as individualistic societies might have you believe. I think it's important to have a sense of self, drink coffee, change the radio station, etc. 

- Meeting someone new: I also find it very difficult to get into new relationships this way. Surely someone might fall in love with your turned-off persona and break your wall, but this might be a problematic coping mechanism for someone who prioritises loving relationships in their life.

- Too cold? Finally, it only makes you stronger. But what I'm thickening here is my sense of empathy and ability to love, and I feel like I might get too cold/insensitive proceeding this way. It's kind of scary. I think a potential way to counter this is to volunteer to a cause or charity, so I might consider this.

**In conclusion**:

This is maybe just a long-winded way of saying invest in yourself and give yourself time

Like many of you, I could barely eat, woke up in the middle of the night thinking about her and unable to fall back asleep, and couldn't function with my work.

Tonight, I would, but I've also decided I'm not waiting anymore. Here is what helped me:

1) Get all of the pain and anguish out of your mind and body. For me, and got out a lot of the hurt onto my computer. Most important: Don't send anything you write, just keep it to yourself.

2) No contact. It goes without saying

3) Get rid of everything. All of the pictures, etc... I managed to do that around day 5 and you just have to clear your mind and 'blank out' while you just hit the delete button over and over. Another big thing for me was washing my sheets and vacuuming my house. I had long blonde hairs everywhere that ceaselessly reminded me and my sheets still smelled like her. Anything that could remind you of your ex needs to go. If you still hold onto hope that you'll get back together, trust me, this stuff isn't that important and you can take new pictures.

4) Work out. I highly recommend taking a group class of some sort so that you're out with other people. Preferably take one with hot guys/girls that give you something to look at

5) Talk about your situation with friends and family over the phone. I'm lucky to be close with my brothers, some of them even worse than what you're going through. A lot of them can give you great advice and comfort. I'm super thankful to have an awesome mom who has been through some serious heartbreak, and I never failed to feel better after talking to her. It's great to talk over the phone too because it's not so terrible/embarrassing when you start to cry. This is a great release and highly recommended.

6) Join a dating site. I personally was using Match before I met my ex, there are other good people out there who are looking for love and have been hurt just like you have. There's no reason to waste another day on this earth wishing for something that isn't meant to be. Trust me, I cried and cried lamenting the future that might have been with a girl who I knew I would be happy with for the rest of my life, but there are a LOT of other people out there who would be happy to meet you and share their life with you. I spent plenty of time this week wishing and second-guessing, but at the end of the day you have to believe in your own worth and know that you deserve someone who will give you their whole heart with no reservations.

- She had no struggle to not contact me
- she looked like she already was over our relationship

I learned the bitter truth: She was already over me or trying to move on when she broke up.
i asked her if she missed me even a little bit and her response was no. I don't really miss you and don't often think about you. Dead honest.
She really wanted to move on and i was the one holding her so thats why she needed distance and very less contact.

I already knew there was another guy who is in love with her, but she has trouble really feeling comfortable.

Part of the reason why being dumped was so difficult was because I thought I we were going to get married, a nice house in SoCal with a fenced in yard, and the careers of our dreams. What made you decide that I wasn't good enough for you? I'll never know, but what I do know is this: the man who I thought I was going to marry is not the man I know you to be now. You showed me a whole different side to yourself. The lying, foolish, naive, put-your-dick-on-craigslist-two-days-after-we-broke-up side of you. If I married you

So, instead of missing you like crazy and pining over you every waking second, I hate your guts and want to knock out your teeth with a golf club. It hurts realizing that I wasted a year and a half of my life dating a complete fuckhead and that I was wrong about you, but I needed to learn this lesson.

You made me realize that I have settled for less in every single relationship I have ever been in. Now, have to tend to your new girl and don't get the growing opportunity that I have. That's enough revenge for me. I am a strong woman, and I'm above laying in bed crying over some pathetic guy. Especially if that pathetic guy is you.

When I'm ready to find the *actual* man of my dreams, I wasn't the best version of myself. Now I have the chance to find her, and I'm already on my way there. You used to be my best friend, but now my best friend is ME. And we get closer and closer every day. In my eyes, you will always be that douchelord that turned my world upside down in the worst possible way at the worst possible time, and that's ok. I don't love you anymore, I'm glad that I can see you for who you truly are, better things

I wanted to tell you that it gets better. I am 2.5 months into the healing process of a breakup after a 2 year relationship. I've done the tears

I'm okay.

Let me give you a background. 24F, my world was so interwoven with theirs, I didn't have my own life, just an extension of theirs.

I had a 2 month project come up overseas. He breaks up with me a week before I go. Cue 6 weeks of crying everyday. Not understanding. Disappointment. Rejection. Misunderstandings between he and I. 

I initiate no contact. Break it every 2 weeks or so. Hide from social media. And then it's like a switch flips.

Now i'm here. Back from a rejuvenating 2 week vacation with a best friend. Tanned

It does get better.

Your ex is just a person. They aren't the right person for you right now
But guess what? They are still great in their own way
They probably taught you things you didn't even know you needed to learn, you walk your path alone. You will still be walking it even without them.

It's okay if you didn't always handle yourself with dignity in the process (it IS a process) and you can't be judged by what you did yesterday

I'm taking on today with a smile on my face, but I won't wallow in them.

I'm telling you that you can feel this way too. Turn the situation around. It does get better. They all say it

1358255955.0,16m6qv,To My Ex,MrGodsgiven,28,7,8,"Dear ________

We broke up in May of last year. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. It destroyed my soul but at the same time, emotionless, uncaring, selfish and non-functioning. There was nothing. I couldn't smile or laugh, people at work would constantly ask me if I was alright and I'd force a twisted half-smile and shrug it off. All I felt was emptiness

Then the pain started. Everything reminded me of you and being reminded of you caused me a sharp pain in my soul like I've never experienced before. It wasn't sadness or grief

Then reality hit me one day and I tried contacting you several times over the period of a few months. If you didn't ignore me

Then the pain slowly but surely vanished and was replaced with a burning desire to change. This is the part I can't thank you enough for. I got a promotion at work, most importantly I felt happy again. I started hanging out with a girl from work and we'd have a great time together. I had a new lease on life and things were going great

I asked the girl from work if she would be my girlfriend and soon enough

A few months passed and I'd forgotten about you again. Luckily I managed to keep up all of my positive changes and life was going great again. I met lots of girls and had been enjoying the single life much more than before. I was flatting with my best friend and I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. To top things off

Fast forward to the day before my best friends wedding. I text you. This time we have a mature conversation and I begin to think that we might have a chance of being friends again one day. The problem is

Now, but you will always have a special place in my heart.

Thank you so much for everything Kidface

Love

MrGodsgiven

1355917347.0,153s6h,Read this and listen to me because I just had an epiphany.  Sorry for the swearing.,MooseMeese,24,4,13,"**~A little back story~**

We met during our first days in university and it didn't take long for us to hit it off

We made it a couple months past 2 years together.  Obviously

**~2.5 months later~**

Keeping in contact was a **fucking mistake**.  I thought I could do it.  I *wanted* to do it.  I **needed** to do it.  **It all went to shit**.  Listen to me

Long story short

The truth?  *She's right*.  **I need to get my shit together**.

It was like the flick of a switch.  Feeling so down, not even **her**.  There is no better time than the present for improvement.  And I'm *21 years old*, I'm not even done university.  **I'm gonna fucking live a little**.  And then I sit down and play video games half naked on my bed *without her* **and fucking enjoy it**, then make a post on reddit about how *damn* good I feel for once.  **Damn good**.

I realized all the things I wanted to fix about myself for her

If you are wondering, at this stage in our lives, *we need to be single*.  The feelings need to subside and reality needs to set in.  *There will be love for me*, from someone else.  Then *maybe* we can work out a friendship.  **And we can enjoy an amazing single life alongside each other**.  Why am I moping around?  **I've got the best years of my life ahead of me**.

I'm not out of the woods yet.  This post is a **warning**.  As I said, **be strong**.

My only hope is that I can improve myself to who I want to be.  A person she will *enjoy* being around.  She may not *love* me

I've sent her my farewell message.  I've told her I need to get over her, *months from now*, **when all the wounds have healed**, she will accept me for what I am.  Someone that just wants to experience life with her, **whatever that holds**.

**And if it doesn't work out

1352092641.0,12njbn,It's my time to go /breakups. Thanks for everything.,,29,7,4,"Eight months. It's been eight months and I still find myself checking r/breakups almost daily. I do it more out of habit than need at this point. Helping other people and giving them the best advice I could really helped me through a rough couple of months. In order to keep doing that, I can't do it anymore. I realized today that it's time for me to do my final purge of this breakup. I need to get rid of the last part of the cancerous mass that has been holding on inside me

During the days and nights I don't think about her at all. I don't have any hopes to see her again and I honestly don't want to. I no longer think of ways I can make her jealous or other means of petty revenge. She appears in my dreams sometimes, nor do I want to publicly shame her. I don't want her to contract some unknown African virus and die painfully and alone. She isn't 'good' or 'bad', she is simply dead to me. Gone, never to return.

I've said all I could have ever wanted to say, know what she is, and so do I. Her tarnished if not blackened reputation is the best I could ask for, and I am completely satisfied with it. Nay-Sayers and shit-talkers are luckily people I couldn't give a fuck about, they consist of mainly failures and children in adult bodies. My conscience is clear. 

I am able to distinguish my real ex from the dream girl I made her into in my mind. Even though I still think about the dream girl, I can't help but laugh too. I've had some 'casual encounters' and am currently speaking to the 3rd girl I've seen since my ex. I've learned to have little to no expectations, but I can't help but stay hopeful. I am nearly fully restored to my former self, my pain is never present. It can still hurt if I let my mind drift, though.

My mind drifts when I come here. I begin poring over these posts and I remember with sparkling clarity the words that were said, paralyzed by re-living the pain over and over. My throat closes and tears make their way out of my eyes. That old feeling of being punched in the stomach says hello once more. Sometimes I think about it all night and into the next day. I'm so done with that though, my apologies to any I promised to respond to and left hanging.

My final advice to them and to any other readers is to keep going, don't have a moment of weakness. Don't think that just a quick peek at their facebook or sending a friendly message to them will do anything but fan the flames of your dying pain. Even if you think it won't, it most certainly will. It's a mistake a made far too many times, it always set me back.

Well, I will never come back. I am leaving my pain in the past where it belongs, try to start doing it too. **This is only as hard as you make it. Stay focused and intent on getting better, it will happen in time. I hope soon that many of you will make a post like this. After, you can strive freely into the future, taking only the fond memories of your ex and the harsh lessons learned with you. You will be a better and stronger person because of all of this pain, you'll earn that.

* She's quick to get anger or upset
* She's bossy
* She'll Whine about mundane things
* She's petty
* She can be extremely catty
* She's sloppy and unpredictable when drunk. She projects her anger and insecurity over previous D-bag boyfriend on to me.
* She's introverted
* I don't ever remember her apologizing
* That's probably because she always thinks she's right.
* She absolutely cannot take criticism
* She argues irrationally
* She's indecisive about trivial things like what to wear or what movie to watch
* She is perpetually stressed out
* She doesn't particularly like anything that I do in terms music/movies /sports and hardly feigns interest.
* She doesn't appreciate me for me and was always trying to change me.
* She's obsessed with looks/weight to a crippling degree.
* Refuses to deal with heavy emotional baggage from brothers suicide. (I realize this one is heavy
* She has an immature and dependent relationship with parents
* She's unrealistic and unclear about her expectations in relationships.
* She's a poor communicator
* She lacks romantic passion and intimacy skills.
* She had a tendency to be jealous
* Worst of all she separated our dogs and DESTROYED the comfort of my home after 2 years at the drop of a hat and with little explanation and no more than a half-hearted apology.

In those two months, and why was I still doing it.

I realized that as much of an ""awesome person"" as I knew I was, it became a little more clear that I was only with her as a crutch. The ex before her had fucked me up REALLY bad. Three years and an amicable split? Sure. That's a nice way to end it. But I was alone again and I couldn't function properly.

So I simply went for the low hanging fruit. She wasn't the best looking thing in the world, she's off with some other guy. Maybe I had that coming for making a rebound out of her. Regardless, it was over and I was glad it was over, wether I'd admit it or not. 

That point of clarity came and I began functioning again

So I started back into some old hobbies that made me happy. I reconnected with old friends. Started going out and making new ones. And by the first month's passing

At the point of clarity, were weren't going to make the same mistake again, and we've been taking it nice and slow. If things blossom, things blossom. But she's of a similar mindset to I at this point: ""I'd rather depend on myself than anyone else. I've never let me down if I tried not to."" 

And that's been incredibly valuable. I've started seeing myself looking at goals and achievements in life. Things to really push for for myself. Things that make me happy just by being. The ultimate light at the end of the tunnel was knowing I have to do things because they're what make me feel alive. I'm not sure where I'm going, that's great, but I won't be making any pitstops to appease them.

This breakup is the second worst I've been through
  
But alas, because she had been feeling this way for some time now, holding it in. My plan for Wednesday's dinner had been to talk to her about how we need to start taking some more proactive effort to get our schedules to click together. Well I didn't get to have that talk because she broke up with me first.  
  
To be a bit more specific, and she wants a baby of her own. I just don't know if that's something I want.

It's something I really want to face, for me, for my son, for any future women who are even half as good as this one.  

Maybe there's even still a small chance I can win her back…I know to be realistic though and not expect anything. We still talk and let each other know how much we adore each other.

**Knowing When It's Over**

This is probably the single most important thing about breaking-up.  In a nutshell, email, social networks, everything.  The first few days, weeks, or months will hurt, but it *will* get better in time.  Having a keen focus on other things will ease separation anxiety

**Self-Improvement**

Reading post after post, really.  Fellow redditors constantly say, ""Hit the gym!"", but it's for a good reason.  Not only are you doing this for your own benefit, but it also works to put your focus on something else, relieving stress.  Endorphin levels are also elevated when you work out (they are chemicals in your brain responsible for making you feel good).  Also, focus on work, or whatever will keep you busy.  Right now for me

**Memories

Depending on how long the relationship lasted, you wouldn't need to visit /r/BreakUps?).  These usually only work in hindering your focus as well as capturing simply the good times.  You wouldn't take a picture of yourselves fighting, would you?  Additionally, drowning yourself in sappy songs, or songs that remind you of the person might feel good, but they only work to facilitate negative feelings (which is what you want to get rid of ASAP!).  

**Facebook

Again, etc. could work to your advantage.  Some people have to resort to deleting Facebook or other social networks entirely to help them forget.  

The point is: You don't want to see what this person is up to.  Which is what social media was designed to do; connect you to people.  If they are dating someone else, or even just hanging out, seeing this **will probably hurt you** and sometimes make you do irrational things (like initiate contact...or cry.)  

**Going Out**

Even though you probably don't feel like it, not to be miserable.  Drinking is usually okay...but getting smash drunk because you're depressed is probably not.  (Alcohol is a depressant.)

**Self-worth**

In the end, time really does heal most wounds.  Remember that you are important and being happy and comfortable with yourself is the key to being able to get back on the relationship saddle and moving on to bigger and better things.  Be confident.  Don't wish, hope, and wait -- start doing.

He broke up with me after a silly fight I started, he was so happy for some reason. It gave me hope. But then the next weekend we broke up.

I was so goddamn crushed. I cried and cried. I didn't get out of bed. I didn't have a job at the time,browse on here and complain, and lost a lot of weight from hardly eating. 2 weeks after we broke up, I went on the dating site we met on and looked at our past messages we sent each other..basically torturing myself. It showed that he rejoined too. I was so upset, and went crazy on him. He said he wasn't on there to date...which I do believe him. He deleted his profile and I even looked for him under different user names and didn't find him, so he was telling the truth. I know, crazy psycho ex mode

But after I cussed him out, if your ex's agree to this, that means they don't respect you. Especially if they know you care and love them more then they do you. My ex said no because he respected me and didn't want to mess with my feeling. I told him we couldn't be talking anymore, and he agreed. I broke NC once, and it was a bitch. I'd suggest, if you really feel the urge to, do it, it will make you realize that this person really doesn't want you back. 

So the first month was horrible. I talked to no one. Didn't flirt. Cried. Eventually I started my new job, can't really make you happy. 

In February, who gave me a heart monitor for a day. I was stressing myself out way too much over this guy that it started to affect my heart. The cardiologist said it was related to stress and for me to go see a counselor and get on antidepressants. I opted not to. I told myself if I wasn't happy by June, then I would go get help. But at that point, it was only 3 months after the break up. 

In March, I think he came into my life to show how it was to be treated great. 

In April, but I still liked my ex.

But now I don't. I don't relate to any of you like I used to. I'm sorry, depressed and often suicidal me of over a year ago. If I were to impart any advice now, it would come across as patronising. ""Time heals all scars! It gets better! You won't even know who you were back then! You won't even care about her anymore!"" 

Nobody wants to hear that. If I'd heard that advice from someone after my break up

Trust me, no job, nothing to do. I'd lost everything over the course of the relationship. And then I lost her. I was at the lowest point of my life. I was beyond depressed. I shut myself away in my room for almost two months refusing to eat anything for days on end. My attempts to turn things were thwarted by this severe anxiety that consumed me. I couldn't even enjoy watching TV or reading a book without thoughts of her plaguing my mind.

So this place helped me a lot. I was able to let things out and help others and notice my progress and I slowly got up and changed things. Once things got better and I started eating and exercising and working I still had this sadness about me. She was still on mind. But over time that wore off. A part of me thinks I wish I had the perspective I had today back then

I was recently out of a relationship of 3 years with another woman whom i have a 5 year old daughter with. Was still going through all the mess of child custody when i met EX#2 playing poker one night at a local poker club. She seemed fun so i asked her out. Took her to Vegas and we had a great time so began regular dating. Her job at the time paid very little and seemed shady looking back so most of the time i paid. Fast forward 6 months of dating she loses her job and cant find work so i let her move in with me (BIG MISTAKE)

When she moved in she moved in with Trash Bags and wouldn't let me help her. Basically all of her stuff was in black trash bags and i found out she was a bit of a slob (I am a neat freak)

First week is when the problems began

Then money started to go missing... 20 bucks here, DVD's, Games i had purchased.... Hell an entire Wii in my daughter's room.

To make matters worse my Ex whom i have a kid with hated her from the start because she was younger and prettier than her... (Long ass story)

Anyways, just venting)

It took 3 months for the home to sell. I moved out Last Thursday (She never once looked for a place to live and basically continued to not work and mooch off me)

2.) My Entire Bedroom Set and King Size Bed Missing

This might be long..

I sucked it up and decided to head to his house with the letter. I texted him and called him a few times informing him I was coming but he was still asleep until I finally got there.

I called some of my friends while on the bus

My original plan was to just give him the letter and leave but he invited me in and I couldn't help myself. We went up to his room and I asked how was his trip and if he slept with him. I already knew the answer

I told him that there were just some things I wanted to say but knowing I couldn't do it

Eventually it died down and I told him that even though in the letter I wrote I wanted him to continue texting me

Things got awkward as I knew I should leave but didn't want to. I forced myself up and tried to move my legs to the door. Apparently his mom was leaving at the same time too and asked if I needed a ride. I said no

As she got into her car to leave

She held my hand the entire time, he shouldn't string them along. It hurt to hear that because it meant he didn't ever love me. But she also said that she knows I'll get through this and that my ex and I would eventually become really good friends, because despite it all he really likes me just not in the same way that I do. I just need to get over this hurdle.

It was.. really good and therapeutic. She said she liked me and already thought of me as her half-son. I started crying again not just because of the pain but because.. she felt like a friend and a mom (I'm not out to my parents) and.. just someone who genuinely cared about what I was going through. 

She bought me lunch and drove me home. And.. yeah that's about it.

I unfriended him on Facebook because I kept checking up on him and the other guy. I unfriended him on Steam because I kept checking to see what he was up to because if he was playing a game it meant he wasn't with him. I finally unfriended him on Google Latitude because I keep trying to determine if he was with him.

When I first met my ex, she never mentioned it, and as far I knew they were just good friends. I later found out the truth and confronted her about it, she apologized for hiding the truth from me but she claimed she didn't want me to be jealous or anything. The problem is that because she was my first girlfriend, I had no idea as to protocol with your girlfriend having close male friends, they'd hang out once in a while and on more than one occasion she had spent the night at his place. After  finding out they used to date ideas of her cheating on me with him were constantly in my head. I even considered contacting Andy at one point to find out, but I didn't. 

How could anyone think it's okay to spend the night at their ex's place when they have a SO? Especially since their SO didn't even know they used to date. It was a blatant disrespect to me and I should have known better, she almost considered going back to him, but decided to stay with me.

Fast forward to 4 years and several months after she broke up with me for an old crush(not Andy). She had a crush on Benny for forever and he had friendzoned her early on in their friendship. After a visit home she was hanging out at Benny's house(deja vu) when he tried to kiss her and she claims she rejected his advances(she probably didn't) She came back home, citing every reason under the sun except for the fact that Benny finally wanted a relationship with her and she couldn't be happier. I later found out about the Benny episode and lost the last ounce of my self-esteem.

Here's where it gets fun, hook up, and act couple-y. I never wanted to be the other guy, but old habits die hard. 

One day it hit me. It's me, the emotional blanket, the fill in, the ""good enough for now"" No more, I don't want to be the Andy anymore, I hope Benny never finds out about how much she cheated on him, I wish that kind of pain on no one.

I texted him last night, and then all I want is him next to me, to smell and to see. I want him with all of my senses. But I can’t have that anymore. Not at all, in any small capacity. I can’t even hear his voice. That’s what’s the hardest--accepting the finality, the fact that he does not want me the way I want him, and that nothing I can do, nothing I can say

It makes me feel weak that I reached out to him. Just a small text, but it made me feel like I had lost something. It made me feel like I should be ashamed. He won’t respond, and why should he--it would only torture me, and torture him, and he’s too good of a person for this fuckery I seem unable to avoid.

I don’t know if I am ever going to be able to be free of his face hovering in front of my mind

How do you get over somebody saying they reject you fully and completely, this is as hard for me as it is for you, as they reach into your chest cavity and rip out everything there? If you loved me, I want to say, If you loved me, why do you say these things. If you loved me, touch me without regret behind your eyes. If you love me, why are you taking your things and walking out the door? If you loved me

I fantasize at night about sitting at a bar alone and letting another man tell me I am beautiful. Maybe I will, though, if I’m in some stranger’s bed with bourbon on my breath again, that I was nothing all along and everything good in me was a reflection of you. And that, that would be the worst realization of all. 

The hardest thing is not knowing. I don’t know if you are sad, if you can’t wait to find love with somebody else more deserving. I have no idea. I have no idea about anything. You said we just didn’t fit together. What does that mean after a year and a half? How is it that I did nothing wrong, like you said? What you are saying is even worse, I hope you realize. You are saying that I did nothing wrong, that I was wonderful, but inherently, in my personhood, you’re rejecting me. And then you somehow think this makes it easier for me. I’m not your genus

I don’t ever want to fall in love again. It seems ridiculous, you said. This is always the chance you take when you love someone. I feel so weary. I feel too weary to try this any more. I’m only 25 but it feels like my life has been mapped out and finished and the direction it is taking I was never even consulted on.

People tell me I will be able to do this again in the future. This seems like telling a paraplegic he will someday walk again. And none of my paraplegic friends have seemed to find a miracle worker.

* There's no point moping around, and when she thinks of them it doesn't make her want to come back to you.  She can think about those things and STILL want to be apart from you.  Don't dwell, don't think back.  Think about the things you need to do at this point to move forward.

* She moved out for fucks sake!  She didn't just go to stay at her mother's for a while and clear her head!   She packed up 80% of her personal belongings and moved out.  She's not looking back.  This isn't temporary.

* Think of all the things she's ""willing to go through"" to get this done.  She left you, living out of boxes and being miserable.  She left her dog here with you.  And she's asked you to look after it in the future (which you're considering...)..  but the fact she could walk away from her house, her dog, financial stability, joint friends...   means she REALLY wants out of this.  So much so she's willing to do almost anything to get it.  Not the actions of someone who would consider reconciliation.

* She's got a new love interest.  That's right..  and this is the part that hurts the most.  Yes she started talking to this guy while you were still together.  Doesn't seem like there was anything physical going on, you can't know and thinking about it only hurts you.  Don't think about things you can't know for sure, because your mind will fill in the blanks with things that aren't true and real and it will only hurt you.  Let it go.  Let the thoughts go.  She's not coming back, you're not getting back together so whatever she's doing doesn't matter!

* Stop contacting her.  Yes it's hard when you wake up in a panic at 5am.  You want to text her, a decent car and lots of awesome friends who've been there for you through this.  So as someone said ""80% of your life right now is still great.  Don't let the 20% that is messed up make you forget that.  Don't let the 20% drag you down"".

* You're hurt.  You're feeling betrayed.  You've lost someone very important to you.  But you didn't really know her.  Remember that.  Because the person YOU thought she was couldn't have done this.  You had her on a pedestal, love changes.  Deal with what you have left.  Pick up the pieces and move on, you deserve to do it for yourself.  And don't JUST move on.  Improve!  Evolve!  Do all the things you told her you would do to improve yourself, but do them for you.

Dear Ex

Today was a pretty shit day. I always hate it when the weekend rolls around

Everytime I have this great new idea to reinvent myself, I get this pang in my chest. I'm going to learn skateboarding, take driving lessons, start working out, start on that novel I've been meaning to write ever since I got out of highschool, get insanely good at snowboarding once winter rolls around. And you're not going to be there to see any of it. I want to become someone you wouldn't even fucking recognize if you happen to see me by accident one day. I want to show you what you gave up. Maybe I needed to lose you in order to find myself. But it's just sad. I wanted to share all of these experiences with you, I wanted to share my growth with you. But as the days from the break up to now increase and we become more and more like strangers and less and less like the people we thought we knew, I wish I could tell you. 

Fuck, less anxious, less scared even more and you didn't want to leave if you knew you could be with her. But that shit's not love. You didn't accept me for who I was and to be honest, I didn't accept you for who you were either. The person who deserves me at my absolute best can handle and continue to love me at my absolute worst. I hope that even if you realize that I wasn't right for you, you'll realize in time, that I cared about you and I did my best. So fuck you, and your inability to see that now, but I'll admit I made that too easy for you. You said you haven't felt heartbreak for a long time because you never get close enough to anyone to feel anything. God

1334773344.0,sge10,I'm alive.  And this is my life.,ClosedCircle,23,1,9,"Man, I've talked it out plenty with my friends

My girlfriend of a year and a half dumped me on Saturday.  I'm 25.  She's 29.  The reason was simple

To put it simply, been in love with.  And while something like that is hard to gauge because I have no storied history with love and therefore no frame of reference, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that girl was it.  She was **it**.  I've never felt so connected and tied to another human being.  And I am pretty devastated.  It is totally cliche to say, but I get it now:  I feel like I have a giant piece of me missing.  Just gone.  Every morning (and there's only been four so far, but still) is awful.  I wake up knowing that I live in a world now where she's gone, and all the history behind us is irrelevant.

I am super fortunate in that I have a wonderful family of friends who have flanked me left and right the past few days.  Before an hour had passed of getting dumped, there were more tears, and by the end of the night I had tripped and ate shit walking down the sidewalk, used my face to stop the fall, and now I look like someone royally beat the shit out of me (I even chipped a quarter of a front tooth off!)

But I had a nice moment that night when I got home and I saw my pretty destroyed face.  It all felt very symbolic.  This is how I feel.  And I'm literally wearing it on my face.  And I'm alive

It sucks so bad, she'll find a guy who she will feel that fire towards, and it won't be me.  That there's a long walk ahead of me, and its gonna be harder than hell the whole way.

But as a friend of mine told me the other day:  ""Don't walk away from this without any wisdom gained.""  And ya know, to people everywhere, and I can appreciate that.  I'm no special case.  And *everyone* has to do this sometime.  Its just part of walking the path.  What, did I think I was gonna be able to just march straight into happiness and contentedness without any hardships on the way there?  Grow up!

So.  Anyway.  That's pretty much it.  I'm pretty shattered by this thing right now.  I think April 14 will probably go down as the year's worst day, then I would call that wisdom gained.

1329926009.0,q10ht,Closing cycles. Simply because that no longer fits your life.,jsnarf,23,2,10,"""One always has to know when a stage comes to an end.

If we insist on staying longer than the necessary time, ending chapters – whatever name we give it, what matters is to leave in the past the moments of life that have finished.

Did you lose your job? Has a loving relationship come to an end? Did you leave your parents’ house? Gone to live abroad? Has a long-lasting friendship ended all of a sudden?

You can spend a long time wondering why this has happened. You can tell yourself you won’t take another step until you find out why certain things that were so important and so solid in your life have turned into dust

But such an attitude will be awfully stressing for everyone involved: your parents, your sister, everyone will be finishing chapters, turning over new leaves, getting on with life, and they will all feel bad seeing you at a standstill.

None of us can be in the present and the past at the same time, sons that feel guilt or rancor towards our parents, lovers who day and night relive an affair with someone who has gone away and has not the least intention of coming back.

Things pass

That is why it is so important (however painful it may be!) to destroy souvenirs, sell or donate the books you have at home. Everything in this visible world is a manifestation of the invisible world, of what is going on in our hearts – and getting rid of certain memories also means making some room for other memories to take their place.

Let things go. Release them. Detach yourself from them. Nobody plays this life with marked cards, your genius to be discovered, your love to be understood. Stop turning on your emotional television to watch the same program over and over again, the one that shows how much you suffered from a certain loss: that is only poisoning you, nothing else.

Nothing is more dangerous than not accepting love relationships that are broken off, the old one has to be finished: tell yourself that what has passed will never come back. Remember that there was a time when you could live without that thing or that person – nothing is irreplaceable, a habit is not a need. This may sound so obvious, it may even be difficult, but it is very important.

It was really hard. I was miserable but it helped to mourn my loss and reflect on things.

Here are my own personal interpretations of who NC will work for and who might be able to remain friends.

NC is the way to go:

* If you were deeply in love with someone at the time of breakup

* Whether dumpee or dumper

* This might be the most important concept to understand in NC. You loved the person who you are no longer with. You may have even wanted to marry them, etc.. now all of that is gone. You wanted them as a lover, but not as a friend. It's okay to feel this way. There is no rule that says you need to stay friends after a breakup. In fact, most people do not. Those who do fall into another category.

NC is not necessary:

* If the relationship ran it's course, you will get to a point where you want your former lover to be happy, and you will be okay with it.

* If you both never really romantically loved each other

Again, helps enormously. Having confidence in NC is extremely important in those weaker moments.

I have to believe that everything is better for you now, that the pressures of your life with me are diminished.  I have to believe that your worries are gone and you know what is right for you.  I trust that you are working hard to diminish what we had and forget the good times, because it's easier to only remember the bad.  Remembering the bad makes it easier, justifies the pain that we are going through. 

Telling ourselves that it won't work, the racing hearts, the mental anguish, the aching in our chests worthwhile.  I have to tell myself that you're better off without me, that you deserve better than anything I can do for you.  If you believe it, then I have to believe it too.

I would have convinced you of my love and made sure you knew that I would never let you down again.  I would have made you waffles every day (instead of just weekends) and brought it to you in bed.  I would have called in sick to work and taken you on a road trip to wherever you wanted to go.  I would have stayed in bed longer and hugged you more.  I would have drowned my insecurities and built you up.  I would never have made snap decisions based on emotion. I would have always asked about your day before telling you about mine.

To explain, I miss seeing her after a frustrating day, I miss long night phone calls. When we face it, each relationship we've had with that special person we've built a huge amount of memories and experiences which is completely normal. One thing though that redditors are often getting confused about is whether they still love their exes. We might think we do but infact we only miss loving them. It's another experience that we miss, not something we still feel. You can miss your ex, that's completely fine. I still miss mine but I know now that I don't love her. 

We often interrupt the feeling of missing love as a feeling of love altogether which blinds our minds and makes us an emotional mess. ENough of that! I'm telling you heartbroken redditors to really ask yourself if you still love this person that ripped your insides or whether you just miss feeling that close with them. There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between still loving someone and missing them. And this BIG DIFFERENCE is often overlooked because when you're an emotional wreck your mind can't really separate the two

To finish; ""No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it. Through and through, it's there. If you have to ask yourself whether or not you love someone then ""sorry honey, [she's/he's] not the one"". (another matrix quote!? FTW) So if you just read the above few paragraphs and are undecided of your love then it's definitely not love but if you're a hundred percent still in love then I guess you got the real deal. And your hurt is probably an open wound. And a last bit of advice, NO FUCKING CONTACT. You see it all over Reddit, No god damn contact!!!

1365722329.0,1c63pc,4 months in - It gets better (No really. I didn't believe it either.),suspicuoushusband,23,2,11,"I'm a little over four months in since my wife (of four years, I couldn't concentrate at work

Now I realize that it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Because my god it was a terrible relationship. Excuse me for a minute while I dive into my rant and the things I'll never miss. Wall of text incoming

- Her temper was terrible. I would always watch her be sunny and delightful with everyone else, disrespected, and treated like a child. Constantly. I would also make excuses for it - stress, hormones, whatever. Sometimes I would get a curt apology, but usually not. No matter how many times I tried to talk to her about it, nothing changed. It wasn't until only recently that I realized it's simply not okay to talk to anyone like that

- I was an atheist, our difference in faith meant a lot more to her than it did to me, so at some point these talks started ending up in her becoming upset and me having to console her. So I stopped. Or tried. Once I stopped starting them, she would try to egg me into them herself. And because I was so passionate about the subject, I couldn't keep my mouth shut, and I'd take the bait. And of course, an hour later, and it would be up to me to fix it. I swear she got some kind of twisted enjoyment out of purposely getting me to make her upset

- Compulsive over-spender. Shopping sprees every weekend. Meanwhile I spent years with the same small wardrobe, buying a house (which in hindsight, thank god) were constantly pushed back, and we ended up just treading water. Again, no matter how many times I tried to talk about this, I was just called ""controlling"", or obsessed with penny-pinching, and busted my ass to try to get us ahead of the curve. It was never appreciated, resigned to the fact that we'd live in an apartment for the rest of our lives.  
 
- For the majority of our marriage, or made her less attractive to me, and as she would fish for compliments, I exhausted myself trying to make her realize that. She also projected her own self-image issues onto me. Would make comments about my own negative features, things like my big ears, or crooked teeth - things that she knew I was terribly self-conscious about. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and say it was a sub-conscious way to knock me down to her level. During the last year of our marriage, she got back into shape, and thought that would make things better. Instead she just started getting more attention from other guys

- I simply couldn't make her happy. I cycled through every ""love language"", gifts, affirmation, quality time/conversation. I exhausted myself trying, but you can't make someone happy who refuses to be happy with themselves...and you'll be unhappy as well. Sometimes I wonder if my wife ever actually loved me, or if she simply used me to make her feel better about herself. It's a sobering though, and I hope it's not true...but if it is

- All of this turned me into a negative, or if this was just the way I was. Only now am I realizing it was the relationship doing it. This really hit home a few days ago, cleaning out old pictures on my PC. Years of photos, and from about the halfway point of our relationship on, I couldn't find a single one where I looked genuinely happy. Every smile looks forced, and my eyes just have this hint of sadness and exhaustion. But all the photos taken in the last month or so? I'm grinning like an idiot, and loving life. And I feel that way now, this negativity was one of the reasons she cited for leaving....and that ended up being what fixed it!

Okay, I'm excited as hell, and that excitement just feeds on itself to the point where I want to tell everyone I can.

I guess I could be bitter about ""wasting"" almost a third of my life on this girl. But I don't want any more negativity. Sure, it wasn't a waste. If nothing else, it taught me what *not* to want in future relationships. And as bad as things were, I still have plenty of good memories as well, and I'll always keep those. I don't want anything to do with my ex now, because of the way she treated me (then and now), but I don't wish her ill. That said, but whatever. I'm just indifferent at this point. I just hope I can get through this divorce process as quickly and cheaply as possible. All I want to do now is finally close this chapter of my life and move onto the rest of the book. 

Of course

So, and I'll never find anyone even close."" False. I thought the same thing. No one's perfect. I wasn't. She sure as hell wasn't. Your ex isn't either. Get them off the pedestal. 

And I've said all of this, if not the best thing that ever happened to you. Why? Because you're awesome. Life is awesome. And it's too fucking short to waste a second being with someone who doesn't want to be with you, and make you as happy as you make them. And it's certainly too fucking short to waste a second missing or pining to get back someone who doesn't fit that bill.

So be sad today. And then tomorrow get up, you will find them. But you have to get up off the floor first.

 That you really do need to learn to love yourself before someone else can love who you are. Personally


To all those who have had their hearts broken


Step 1: Acceptance

When someone decides that they no longer want to be with you (for whatever reason) there is nothing you can do to change their mind. Their mind is made up, whatever you do, don’t let them keep you from living your own life. Maybe one day they will be ready to come back to you but in the mean time, NOW is the prime time to begin the journey of discovering who you are better than you have ever done before.


Step 2: Discover/Define who you are

Take time out of your day and make a nice long list of all the things you like about yourself. i.e. physical appearance, hobbies, talents, attributes.  (making a damn good grilled cheese sammich for example) Nothing is off limits and be as specific as possible. Make another list of all the cool things you have accomplished i.e. graduated from kindergarten, making a rubber band ball. Again, nothing is too small or insignificant to add to the list. Make another list of all the bad things that have happened to you and explain how those experiences have taught you a precious lesson and molded you into who you are today. There is no right or wrong answer, every bad experience has a take away lesson that is different for everyone. Add to the lists daily, monthly


Step 3: Create the best version of yourself

Give yourself standards. Set yourselves some goals. Small reasonable goals at first i.e. finish that one book, improve your savings account, or finish school.  You set your limits. The only thing limiting you to how amazing you can make yourself is you. For every excuse you can come up to prevent you, come up with two reasons why you can. 


Step 4: Build a Personal Resume 

It is exactly what it sounds like. If you get bored one day (like on the 30th page of Reddit bored… Let’s be honest here…We have all done it.) Type up/draft yourself a resume. Include all the things you have in your lists. Personality traits, personal goals, ALL the good things!


Step 5: Show off

Now that you have built a good foundation for your personal resume with lists of attributes, it would be a shame to keep how awesome you are all to yourself.  By this point how could you not begin to love all the things that make you who you are? (I mean geeze, you made a resume about yourself for goodness sake)
 Meet new people and have new experiences. Remember that skydiving Groupon?…. Go for it! Hell


I know it is all easier said than done. Believe me when I say I know how hard it can be to think of just one good thing about yourself. It won’t happen overnight, or a year. It requires your everyday effort to find the good in yourself and retrain your brain to perceive yourself in a better light. 


Some days you will fall off the wagon and it is okay. It happens to the best of us. Just pick yourself up. Hell… drag yourself out of that giant mud puddle of negative thoughts and emotions. Take a shower and do some singing while you are in there. When you are having bad day pull out those lists and resume you spent time making and carry on.  It is a way of living not just a magic fix. It takes effort and time.  


tl:dr- 5 steps to help with break-ups and learning to love yourself. You either read it or you don’t. Hopefully this helps at least one person out there.

This is a stage that I knew I would hit from the moment I fell for you. I knew you were incapable of returning my affection and yet I tried anyways.

We were friends first. I loved you then. I hated how shitty your friends and family seemed to treat you and I wanted to be better. These last few months have shown me that you don't want that. That what you are used to is what you like.

You were right. We are too different. Even though it's my own fault for bringing us to this place. You share some of the blame too. You let me into your heart and you fiercely loved me whenever you felt like it. But only when you felt like it...

I was in a miasma of confusion these last few weeks. You wouldn't even talk to me. You stopped talking to me like a friend and started treating me like a burden.

That's the moment our relationship died.

I don't know what I feel right now but I still wish the same for you as I did the moment I fell for you. I want you to be happy. You of all people deserve it. You're so close to my own heart that I can't help but wish it for you.

First of all - thank you guys for your input. You all helped me recognize that I had nothing to feel sorry about - nothing to blame myself for. I know without a single doubt that I gave this relationship my all and I didn't get the love I gave back.

I'm going to end it, and her car gets me to work, and we share a lot of furniture, so I'm going to give her to the end of the month to get her shit packed and move out, and see if sharing transportation can work in the meantime. I think that's a fairly even deal. 

In my past relationships, I did something wrong or said something that wasn't right to say, I didn't try hard enough. Guilt isn't an easy thing for me to deal with - I have a really hard time accepting the fact that I fucked up and it doesn't mean I'm a shit person. 

Anger, and told her about it, rather than making me feel better, or coming clean, she made me feel like an asshole for being suspicious. Who does that?

I'm holding up better than I thought I would be at this point. I think the rage is keeping the tears at bay. There have been tears - just not quite as many as I'd expect. I know I was wronged, and needs time to figure herself out before she's right for anyone. She ruined what could have been a perfect relationship, because up until this happened, it was. My suspicions were the ONLY thing we ever fought about.

I know that once she's gone, I'm carless with a 3-digit bank account and student loan debt, and I'm on my own. I make money, and I have a few ebay sales that could net me enough to buy a car - so I'll hope for the best.

At this point, I would always doubt anything she told me, it would be months before I could stand to touch her again, and in the end it would fall apart anyway. There really is no coming back from this for me. That energy is going to be spent getting my finances in order, rearranging my house, doing yoga (before you call me a fruitcake I'm recovering from a spinal injury I got in OCS a few years ago and it's the only exercise I'm allowed to do :P), and generally working through everything. I also just bought the Dark Souls DLC

We worked on it on and off over the next 5 years, and then when I went off to Law School, she went back to our home town and got a retail job. 

Our lives simply headed down different paths. We broke it off in the fall of 2010 and I started dating someone new

The truth is I'm very happy for her

She was the girl I wanted things to work out with. We were best friends

There was the dream of the future we were supposed to share. The marriage, warming by the fire in the winter. She spent Christmas with my family and me with hers. 

I know I'm glossing over the bad memories

Next week I'll be on my way to fine

She'll always have a place in my heart. 

So here's a toast

All the best on your marriage

Advice: do not search ex on social media!,throvavay22,24,2,16,"I am 28 years old male, planing our kids names and everything...We had wonderful relationship. I never loved and carried so much in my life. She left me suddenly when she went to visit her parents and never come back. She took everything and most important my heart and trust. 

Last year I was destroying my self with alcohol. Basically I can't find life strength in anything else. I am depressed. When I meet new person I only search for her. I am not interested in other girls. I had one night stands in my drunken nights but morning after I just hate myself and become more depressed. 

Finally I got some strength thru my job and some travels around the world I made. I stopped drinking every day and now just 1 day on weekends when I go out with my friends..I started to work out and started to feel little bit better. All this time there is no one minute I can't stop thinking about her. 

Today I found her profile on social media. She is happy in love with handsome Swedish looking guy who looks like a millionaire. I searched him and he owns invest companies. She enjoys sailing on his boat. She take photos of their dinners and presents from him. And beside everything he really looks like a good person. She looks more beautiful then ever and very happy.

1342932656.0,wyeil,Just a little pick-me-up for the heartbroken :),vinomatt,22,4,7,"Hey everybody

I Just wanted to offer some positive words to those of you who are hurting pretty bad right now. I know it feels like hell

It's been 3 months and occasionally that pain sneaks up on me like a thief in the night. 

What I want to tell you is that IT DOES GET BETTER. unfortunately

1. Acceptance is the first and most important step. A little introspection is okay. But don't over think it. You're not going to fix it. You can't start to move on until you realize that you will have to let them go. 

2. Distract your mind. Take up a new hobby or learn something new. Every time that familiar feeling pops up, then dismiss it. After a while it will be less frequent.  

3. Get healthy. If you have a drink

4. I know you hate hearing this (I did) and it's been posted a bazillion times, and wanted to call her for days afterward. Once you get past the first few days, you'll realize that you've been getting along just fine without them. 

5. Some days will be harder than others. When things get tough

So that's all I've got for now, don't worry, time will get you there. Hang on and be strong, after all, you're not alone!

1340642019.0,vktl2,*UPDATE* 3 Months Later.,rawrmeansfu,23,3,18,"I thought I'd give you guys an update with how I'm doing. If you want to find out about my story read my past posts.

**What I've Learned:**

**TIME**: This is honestly the only thing that will help you heal and eventually move on.

Yes is does help talking to people about your feelings, cry it out. Talking does help.

**ACCEPTANCE**: I went through the cycle of the 5 stages of a breakup “Denial, Depression, and Acceptance"" many times. The hardest one was Acceptance, but after 3 months I have finally accept that it's over and him and I will no longer be. No matter what I do or say, it's ultimately up to him to make the move, you can't force anyone to love or be with you. 

Another thing that was hard for me to accept is that... sometimes things just aren't meant to be. As much of my heart and soul went into that relationship and as hard as I fought for it... him and I weren't meant to be. Deep down inside I knew no matter how hard I tried it wasn't going to work out. We didn't see things eye to eye... he was who he was and I am who I am... and we aren't meant to be together.

**REMEMBER**: For the longest time, wiser person. I finally realized my worth after the relationship and now I have true standards. I know what I want and what I won't settle for... and that was because of him that I realized all this. I never thought I'd make it through this pain, but I made it and I am so much stronger now. I will never put up with being treated badly again because I just dealt with the worst and I'm not going to make the same mistake again.

Also remember that every relationship will have ""good times"", but with someone else. Don't try to forget the memories you've made with your ex, in time you will replace them with better ones.

**HEART VS. HEAD**: Deep down inside we all know that we want to move on and be happy with someone who appreciates and loves us just as much as we love them. Logic says we should move on and they didn't deserve us

**OVERALL**: I am very blessed for this experience, but it really does help you. I promise you, it does get better... you will feel better... you will make it through this... I know how much pain you are in and I once felt that too... but you will gain something better from all this... everything does happen for a reason.

It was just really hard running across those comments from when we were good, and that was hard to read and delete. I don't want to forget how good she was to me when she was good, but I have to remember that she did cheat on me and it hurt me tremendously.

Otherwise, but I had my friend listen to it and it was about a concert her and I were supposed to go to this weekend. I guess she wanted to see if I still wanted to go (I don't and I'm not), but she was apparently condescending in her tone, so I didn't feel too upset about it. 

I want to move on more than anything else so I can be happy again

An old lady at breakfast overheard me talking to my friends about what happened, that was one of the worst pains I've ever known was being cheated on. You've done the right thing by cutting her out of your life. You stay strong, and the right woman will come into your life, ready to give you her everything and make you her world.

Any-whom, and part ways. I head to a nearby park and sit down. Feeling a little sorry for myself have a cry on the sly (oh, rhyming!) and this homeless man comes over and sits beside me. 

He introduces himself, and he laughs. I was shocked a bit, until he kindly explains that this is a short time, and I am so young. He tells me I am the future, I am the generation that will be in power soon. He tells me I should focus on my goals and get out there and make a difference. He tells me about his experiences of loss and his battles. They make mine feel so small.

The affair was short, there was no reason to be suspicious, I can prove them with pictures. When she stayed out late for work or to have study groups I believed her. She was smart and hard working. I knew she had been down, life had been tough on her. My life, the one that brought her halfway across the country with me, had been tough on her. She was lonely and wanted to feel smart and hard working. She needed more praise than I gave her. We went to a formal dance, me in my uniform and her in a gown, she forgot to wear her rings. There were glossy formal pictures to prove how beautiful she was that night just a year ago last Monday

Before bed that night I kissed her neck and she pulled away.

Her phone had become a busy companion, only to be checked when I had made some distance. I didn't want to be suspicious, we had taken vows. Forever. There were pictures.

Just a year ago last Wednesday I lay in bed not wanting to think about the things I was seeing. The texts, pulling away from tender moments. I woke her up to ask her what was wrong. I needed to hear that her depression was just worse than usual but she loved me just the same. When she told me she was thinking of leaving I was confused and heartbroken and pleading. That wasn't an option. There had been a white dress and family and friends and a honeymoon and promises made. The kind of promises you prove with too many pictures that you hang up to remind yourself how you were once handsome and show off how she's still beautiful.

We took separate cars to my dad's house for Thanksgiving. She wanted to get back home the same night so she could work the next day, my dad and his wife talked to us. Told her not to give up. My dad said it looked like she was already gone and asked her point blank if there was someone else. He had been where she was, he knew this look. She lied.

 I was frantic. I could refresh our phone statement online and see the text messages continue. I called her, but I tried as hard as I could, even if my best attempt was sometimes feeble. There are pictures of vacations and road trips and kayaks and marathons deep in my computer that serve as my record of trying.

When I got back home, and I wondered what to do next. She woke up and went to work an hour early and I tried to keep myself busy. When I walked past the spare bathroom that she had claimed as her own, I noticed a line of new bra's and panties on the towel bar. There were pharmacy bags in the trash. When I looked more closely, as concerned as I was afraid and suspicious, I learned that she had just started taking birth control again. We hadnt discussed it.

I texted her and told her to leave work. That we needed to talk.

When I confronted her with my suspicions I saved the fact that I thought she was cheating until the end, and my own failings in trying to be a supportive husband. I wanted it to be about that. But I had to be honest. I told her I knew about all of the texts, the late nights and the early mornings, the underwear and the birth control and pulling away. I told her that I wanted to be wrong but that I didnt trust any more. I asked her to remember what she felt when she thought her first husband was cheating and I told her that I loved her and would do anything to keep her. I would do whatever I could to trust again. 

Just one short year from this Saturday night she told me that I had made her life miserable and she insisted that she wasnt cheating. She reminded me of the times that I had pulled away, that I wasnt affectionate, that I made her feel ugly. I tried to counter her with how much I loved holding her hand and how I never left home without kissing her goodbye. She packed two bags and left.

I didn't know it then

It's been a long year. She didnt participate in counseling except to blame me for her unhappiness. She admitted to cheating in January, three years to the day after we had stood in a park in Tulsa and posed for pictures in the bright sunlight. She had started wearing a claddagh ring to fill the space that my rings had once occupied. She hid it after she caught my eye it but it was too late. I had given her a claddagh ring once as well, the spring before we were engaged. She hadn't told him this, and he didnt have access to the photo albums to see for himself because they were in storage, where they sit to this day. They moved out of state, back to live with her mom soon after.

In April, and that she had discovered the lies he had told, some of which I awkwardly tipped her off to before she hung up on me a month prior. He had never been to college, let alone graduated. He had received a GED, rather than a High School diploma. He had never been a Baltimore Firefighter. His wife was never a Navy Corpsman. Most shockingly, he had two living daughters with his ex-wife, as opposed to the youngest perishing in a car accident as the story had originally been told. She had seen pictures

I expected him to leave. I expected her to kick him out. I expected her to ask if she could come back or if we could work on things now that she had hit bottom. I expected too much.

He never left. Maybe because he decided to be a good father this time. Maybe because he had trouble holding minimum wage jobs and being responsible enough to pay his own speeding tickets. Maybe because he didnt have a car of his own. I could ask him

She and I  talked nearly every day for 3 months after that tearful April call, then emails and messages after I stepped off of American soil for the cold steel of a transport jet in the summer. I visited her for two days before I left. I put my hand on her belly and cried and told the baby stories about myself and her mom and the waiting world. I sent her things for the baby. Things I knew she couldn't afford for herself and things to prove that I could care about another man's child if she allowed me to care about her again. I missed her dearly. I saw hope, even though the knowledge she still slept beside him and told both of us she loved us pushed me deeper and deeper into despair. I knew I had to cut it off before my friends were put in a position to try to patch the lethal wounds I had began planning to inflict upon myself. 

I've mostly been successful in my attempts to treat her as though she died. It's easier for me to pretend that she died while I loved her than face the reality that she rejected my love. Reality will have to be faced eventually though.

I'm tempted sometimes to email him or call him and let slip a tirade of my best insults. Let him know what a worthless piece of shit he is for allowing another man's wife into his house and telling her about his made up past and poor dead daughter. 

I've hoped that the beautiful tiny little girl they now share would die just to make an honest man of him. Not often

I've wanted to call her and demand to hear why. Why did it only take three weeks for her to leave after meeting him? What does she love about him more than me? What did she love about me more than him? Why didn't she ever ask to come back? All of my friends told me to prepare myself

Now it's been a year, started drinking, been on sleep medication, been in a vehicle that was blown up in an IED strike, and fantasized about my death at my own hands.

I'm terrified of the future, I have the pictures to hold as proof of that.

1372340615.0,1h6e95,Today marks 5 weeks NC for me and also my 25th Birthday. She sent me a text and now life sucks again.,Yellow_Monster,23,3,32,"Hey everyone.

This post is sort of an update/vent/cry for help type post.

I've posted on here quite a few times in the last few months. A lot has happened with my breakup. I've gone through her losing all feelings of love for me and breaking my heart at the beginning of the year

After a while of seeing her again and me not being able to get past her being with someone else fast enough

Today marks 5 weeks into NC. I started it because I knew she still liked this guy she slept with. I saw it coming

A few days after I started NC i saw his facebook change to 'in a relationship'. I knew deep down it meant he was with her now but I got it confirmed when a week or so later I saw she had made a new FB account and was only friends with him and she too was 'in a relationship'.

It hurt like a bitch.

Anyway. So I knew they were together and I know they still are now. Every single day I go around and around in circles in my head. Asking myself 'how can she move on so quickly?' and 'why would she do this to me?'. I know why though. The relationship crumbled and her feelings changed a lot sooner than mine. She had a head start.

It's been around 6 months now sinse the intitial breakup. And they've been together for about a month. Like

So today is my birthday. I'm a 25 year old boy and I woke up and lay in bed for a few hours missing her and thinking about her and her new boyfriend. How happy they must be together. I was dreading today so much. i knew i'd be waiting for it and eventually it happened. She sent me a text.

It was short and sweet. 

'Happy Birthday :) ... I know you might not want to hear it but i didn't know what the best thing to do was... but yeah

I started crying immediately and ran to the bathroom so nobody would hear me. I miss her so fucking much. I know I shouldn't because we had our differences and our problems. it just still feels like a nightmare

I reached out to a good friend because I knew i'd end up texting her a huge message and ruining all my hard work keeping NC. He advised me to just send back 'Thanks x'

Does this mean i'm back to square one with my NC? I doubt i'll get a reply from that and I don't intend to send another message. As much as I want to I know nothing has changed.

I guess i'm just looking for some motivation here guys. I know i'll get better and I know I need to work on myself. it's just so fucking lonely. I have friends and everything but

I feel like my life is going nowhere. I hate my job, but, some people don't make it, or at least some people take years to get there. I don't want that. I want it now, or soon. I'm just so angry and depressed and unmotivated right now. I just can't see this getting better really. We broke up and she got all the good bits.

---

I also want to say thanks to you all. This subreddit has been the biggest help at some of my darkest times and the people who have helped me and given me advise and tough love need to know how much I appreciate it.

I just wish things turned out different.

I wish I didn't love her any more.

Thanks for reading.

I hope you're all doing okay too. As much as I hate what's happening to me and I feel like my situation is unbearable and unique. I know everyone here is going through similiar stuff. I feel for all of you and I hope you all feel better real soon. We all deserve happiness. That doesn't mean being with someone. It just means being happy in any way possible. Finding someone is just a bonus in life. If anyone needs someone to talk to i'm gonna be here so fire away.

1372288990.0,1h54fa,About the past and my break up. Hopefully an encouraging message,jessemfkeeler,23,6,5,"TL;DR - This is a post about how to deal with the past. 

I posted this on my facebook

In the last 25 days I have had to take the crumbles of my self-esteem, I really took a lot of time for myself, read a lot of books, read a lot of stories, watched a lot of movies to try to find out the truth and answer to all of this. Without giving away the details of the last 25 days, I wanted to share with you the lessons that I have learned because I think if it helps you in your time of need like it did mine, then it’s worth it. 

My main journey and one that I’m still working through is the notion of a past. What to do with the past, trying to find out details and wonder if I could change those details, maybe it would be better. Then I found out that I wasn’t living in the present anymore, I was letting my past consume me. We want to live in the future as humans, but we tend to live into the past, repeating moments in the past and hoping for better endings, like an alternate ending in a movie. That’s what I was doing and I was doing this without the essence of prior knowledge and logic that I gained through my years and experience. I was in a state of denial

But then something hit me in the middle of the month. The past is just that, there’s no need to heal it, and it’s only a story. All you can do is let go of the story of who you are. All you can do is change yourself, you can’t change other people. You can only let go of the limited perspective of them. We don’t know truth, not real truth anyways. We only know it through our eyes, and we conduct that as truth. But something is always seen through different eyes, and that person thinks its truth a well even though it could be completely different. Not only that, and it made me mad. 

I felt it was an injustice, this illusion that I created. I realized it was an illusion of injustice though just because it was out of my control. I added that it was an injustice, out of fear and to cope through it. What do we do we when something is out of our control? We should just accept it, but we fight it. But, if there’s nothing you can do, then do nothing. Do nothing. Do nothing. Repeat that, because I had to, I did the best I could do under the circumstances and I stopped worrying about it. 

Everything is a choice between fear and love, I started to choose love and peace instead of fear. I let go of the character I invented of myself, even though it’s still scary. It’s scary to be outside of yourself. But I could do it. I could do that, or at least I have the knowledge to do so. It’s hard to change yourself and try to stop living in the moment, in the present. It’s hard, I know. You think of the what ifs, the could’ve, that’s all I know, but patience comes with understanding. I needed that patience. 

**The past is a story, have to let go of your past, let go of your character you created out of fear. All you can do is change yourself. You look at that story and read it and go “Oh yeah, that was nice right there. Oooh that wasn’t so cool.” You learn from it, but don’t try to repeat and expect a different result. Let go. Let go of your past. Let go of your character you created out of fear. All you can do is change your perspective on other people and old events, and then move on with your life.** 

I’m proud to say that’s the plan. I’m proud to say that with grief comes peace. I am not mad anymore, my failures, and my self-worth consume me. And I loved that I learned this and I learned it all myself. I’m happy to the people that supported me, it means a lot. I hold my head of gratitude for you all. But I’m happy that I went through this journey in my head by myself. I think it was an important journey that I never have had to go through. 

I hope

1370544394.0,1ft3oz,Tempted to contact your ex? Do this instead.,,20,3,9,"**The Backstory (feel free to skip this part):**

I (M 27) was in an emotionally abusive relationship. She (F 26) was perfect at the start at the relationship and once I was emotionally hooked (about 6 months in) the criticizing, disrespecting, manipulating and tantrums began to surface. I tried to do everything I could to turn her into the person she was at the start of the relationship. I never gave up on her, even though doing so would have saved me from a lot of abuse. Eventually, she dumped me. The day after she dumped me she went on OKCupid and bought a paid account. I was devastated. I was so needy, I begged her to get back together (What was I thinking?). We did and the following two weeks were the most exhausting and self-esteem crushing weeks I have ever experienced. She dumped me again via email after a night of yelling insults at me on a date for being ""stupid"" enough to ""talk about our relationship in public"" (see ""Note 2"" at bottom of post for more detailed info regarding this particular night). 

The problem is that I was trying to get my emotional needs met from an abusive individual. I didn't have proper boundaries

I have been broken up with her for a month. She is terrible for me and intellectually I understand that. However

I often get the desire to send her messages or emails of various sorts: angry, etc., because the emotional part of me is still not convinced that it will never get its needs met by her.

**The Advice:**

To curb the desire to contact your ex (which will inevitably descend upon you furiously and repeatedly after a breakup)

When a strong desire occurs, just pay attention to it; the way it sounds and the way it feels on your nostrils and in your lungs. Continue to refocus on your breath when your mind inevitably drifts back to ideas of contacting your ex.

Focus on the breath and feel the emotions without acting on them. Eventually

Each time you successfully use this exercise to avoid contacting your ex

**TLDR - When you feel a strong desire to contact your ex

Note 1: If you are in an emotionally abusive relationship where your partner has treated you without love, walk away (enforce the boundary). Don't waste time trying to change someone or waiting for someone to change. They won't change and you'll feel even more used, exhausted and worthless. You'll think that if you just behave like the perfect boyfriend/girlfriend you'll get the old them back; the one that was sweet, kind and loving. It won't happen - That's not who they really are. Also, don't blame yourself; the abuse is not your fault. Some people abuse others and some don't; it's out of your control. The one thing that is in your control is whether or not you're going to accept the abuse. **Always remember, it's better to be lonely and have high self esteem than to be in a relationship and have none.** Healthy relationships should add to your self-esteem, not decrease it.

I should add that www.baggagereclaim.co.uk has been an invaluable resource for me in getting over my breakup. It's tailored toward women

Note 2: We were having drinks on the patio of a bar and I asked her if she deactivated her OKCupid profile and asked her why she wasn't being affectionate. First, she used anger/intimidation to avoid the subject, put me on the defensive, and changed the focus to my stupidity for daring to bring up the relationship over drinks at a bar.

1370118483.0,1fhbu8,Advice from someone 8 days post-breakup with fiancé of 7 years!,SamStoleMyBanana,24,3,5,"So you just lost your boyfriend/girlfriend/fiancé huh? It sucks doesn’t it? You’re emotions are on one of the worst rollercoasters you’ve ever been on? You feel like you are the only one to truly be hurting? No one has ever felt this pain that you are feeling? You’ve been in bed crying for three days and don’t want to even talk about it?

I’m here to tell you that it gets better..

You see my fiancé of 7 years and I broke up last week. We tried EVERYTHING we could to save it, acting “as if we were in love”, nothing seemed to fix a relationship that quite frankly just…”ran its course”. It happens, sure you’ve had a great run, but have you really? I will go more in-depth what I mean by this here in a moment. I want you to know that ALL the emotions that you are feeling are not abnormal, everything is completely normal and we all feel them.

I’m going to go step by step as much as I can to help you begin your healing process....


**The Failing Relationship**

Do you find yourselves falling farther and farther away from each other? You guys aren’t communicating anymore are you? There’s no intimacy, or let alone gotten a kiss right? These are all signs that something is up in your relationship, I’m not saying that someone is cheating I’m just saying that something is off. When I stopped hearing an “I love you” occasionally is when I started to get nervous about where our relationship stopped. Sure we didn’t say it a lot to each other but we still said it, and when we did it meant something more since it wasn’t over used in our relationship. 

When the warning signs are there you can do a few different things. Every couple is different and will go through a different process than the next, or months would have so play your cards accordingly. 

Can you work this out on your own? Has this worked for you in the past? Have you guys sat down, not just yours. Some talk it out and are great forever, others are only good for a week or two. If you decide to go this route really think about if you are getting what you want out of it.

Have you ever considered going to a counselor? Someone who can look at your relationship as a whole from the outside and see if this is something can be fixed. This is the route I took and it helped me with realizing that she just wasn’t into the relationship the same way I was

What about the breakup? Sure it’s a tough decision to make, go down it sooner than later. 

**The Breakup**

This section is the hardest one to cover. People go through all different types of breakups. Regardless of your type of breakup eventually you will feel all kinds of emotions, and for the most part you will be VERY sad. But something you need to realize is that you will get over whatever emotion you are feeling. Today marks day 8 since I said my very last “goodbye” to (in my opinion) the greatest girl in the world. Last week I would have told you I will NEVER get over this intense feeling of sadness that I am feeling, but here I am 8 days later telling you it does get better. 

The main things you need to keep focus on in this portion is that you make it a clean breakup and NO CONTACT ! If you do that it will make the healing process go a lot more smoothly. One of the things that suck so bad is that when I was sad, and now I can’t because she’s the one who I am hurting over. But please don’t lose your cool no matter what….DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL!

**Post Breakup**

You did it! You broke up with the “love of your life”.... How are you feeling? Sad, stress? Those are all very normal feelings after a breakup, that’s what makes them suck SO BADLY! I had a 4 day “pitty party” for myself, I didn’t eat, I only drank water, and laid in bed all freaking day. That’s all I wanted to do, I mean how could anyone function after losing the greatest thing in their life? How can someone go outside without their other half? How can I face big decisions without talking to THEM first? Guess what? You **CAN** do it! **You can do it, lets go out and find a new partner”. You are repressing normal human emotions by doing something like that and eventually you will regret it.

You have to take time to grieve and then go about your normal every day life. You’ll have to grocery shop; FOR ONE....You’ll have to pay the bills; ALONE....You’ll cook dinner; FOR ONLY YOURSELF....You’ll go to bed every night; ALONE....It’s a rough transition to go from thinking about another person to only thinking about yourself. My other half LOVED coffee, and waiting for her “morning kiss”, or her “have a great day”, imagine what that was like smelling the smell of coffee for the first time post-breakup. There will be the little triggers that will make you think of that person, and that’s ok.That’s a memory that will always be with you no matter what and that’s something no one will take or can take away from you.

Please have a support system in place as well. Whether it’d be family, someone from church, anyone you can just unload your feelings onto and they will just listen, that's what makes a great support system. My greatest crutch has been an old friend I haven’t seen since High School but we’ve maintained a “Facebook Friendship”, she’s been the best one out of my family and closest friends so far. Because she doesn’t bring it up, we’ll talk about other things and then I’ll just casually talk about it and she’ll make some comments or remarks and we’ll move on from the discussion. Just make sure you have someone to talk too, feel free to contact me if you’d like

**Moving On**

Think back on your entire relationship……….. What did you sacrifice for that person because he or she didn’t like it? Really dig deep and think about it, right?

You need to be able to LOVE YOU before you can love another. This one hit me in the middle of the night, I’ve been so miserable for the past year and a half deep inside of me that I was no longer the old me, I had become someone I wasn’t. Then it got me to thinking, it was because I was forming to what “SHE” wanted me to be, I was doing things that made HER happy and not doing things that made ME happy. In order to truly be happy with your life you need to be happy with yourself, and to achieve that you also have to be in love with yourself as well.

Breakups suck! Plain and simple, don’t get me wrong I’m still sad! But this process has hills, and it has valleys…Right now I’m in a valley at the base of a hill, I need to tell myself “It’s time to climb that hill” and when I do, I will have people to lean on to help me get over the hill.


Remember to love yourself…THAT’S the MOST IMPORTANT part of the healing process!

We were in a long distance relationship but I had plans to move back home after college.  I was upset over the breakup as anyone might be but I knew that we were both good people just going our separate ways trying to discover ourselves.

Her birthday was yesterday and so I wished her a happy birthday only to receive a text from my friend

I was going to send her the following but I decided that she is not worth my breath

&gt; I pity you and your cowardice. 

&gt; To end a long term relationship is something I can accept but to lie when asked if there was another person in the picture and then be in a relationship only a month later

&gt; I can't believe how fake you were

&gt; I thought during our time you grew as a person but you're still the same insecure girl looking for approval from guys and scared to be an independent individual.  

&gt; My only regret is second guessing myself when the problem was you.

The pessimistic side of me is pissed I wasted so much time with someone that's so heartless and the optimistic side of me is glad this all came about now instead of down the road when I could've potentially moved in with her.

Let it be noted that I ended all communication with her at the end of March with the exception that I wished her a Happy Easter and a Happy Birthday.  Given the events that took place I don't think I will ever speak to her again.

**TL;DR: Long term relationship came to an end after 3.5 years.  Less than a month later she is with a guy that she was 'friends' with while we were dating.**",,t5_2ra79,1368627986.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1edtag/ex_21f_is_in_a_relationship_one_month_after/

Being single isn't the worst thing in the world it really isn't, not your everything. Embrace it, and don't live life always thinking there's a big gap that can only be filled with someone else.

And even now, just to prevent myself from falling into a dark hole. My thoughts are still consumed by you and everything that I might have done wrong. You took and took throughout our whole relationship and even in your absence you are STILL taking life from me. I'm SO FUCKING SICK of you taking things from me, my happiness and my time and my energy and my LIFE. 

And the worst, too dependent, too emotional. You made me feel that way even though I was carrying all the weight and the stress of the relationship.

My girlfriend and I recently celebrated our first year anniversary and have been going through some tough times lately. We have had a lot of fights in our first year. Mostly caused by me being drunk and like a complete moron. I have been physically aggressive with her before, I would support her. She wanted to keep it in her heart I know this, but she talked to friends and got freaked out and decided to have an abortion. Then she told her parents and they wanted her to keep it because they do not support abortion. So then she went back to thinking about keeping it. It was a few days of to and fro and I could sense she was really scared. We had been drinking a lot during the early days of her pregnancy as it was holiday season. She had also been smoking. So she starts to worry about the baby's health. She decides she can't keep it and we book the appointment in the clinic. She then tells her family she is getting an abortion. She does this via text message to her Mother.
Her Mom completely broke down and begged her not to but my girlfriend was strong and we went ahead and she had the abortion. I was devastated inside because I wanted to keep it but I was trying to be strong for her. I talked to her Mom and Dad about the decision and whatever way the conversation went it came out sounding like I pushed her to get an abortion. So I became demonized. The whole family basically hated me, Brother and Sister. Her parents take a holiday to get away from it all. She asked me to come over to their house one night and her brother threw me out and threatened to beat the shit out of me. It turns out Mom had barred me from the house before she went away but neither me nor my girlfriend were aware of this. She almost had a breakdown and we both went home to my house that night. She was angry at her brother because he was being abusive and threatening and she was angry at her Sister for sticking up for him when he was threatening me. The pressure was immense. At the same time we were both doing okay in our relationship. We were very very close with each other and I felt that I had found the love of my life and I know she felt the same way. I made plans to get counseling for my anger problem.

So after a couple of weeks everything was still fine and so yesterday we were texting all day sending so many nice flirty sexy messages and talking about her moving in. Everything was great. She told me she wanted to marry me all the time and we loved each other so much, the reason you text me about the train was so you could hang out with your friends"" and some other stuff basically to the effect of: I picked drinking with friends over her.

So at this point I have had a few beers and I'm in trouble with the girlfriend so I knock back another one or two and at this point I am now pretty drunk as I was drinking fast. I go home and she shows up and starts going off on me. She is really angry and yelling at me and I can't remember but I think she said ""Fuck this

Her parents are on holiday right now so it was only her brother who was there. I called the house and she answered and told me to fuck off basically. So I wake up this morning and have to go to work. Her Sister calls and says they will be contacting the police etc. I am now sitting in my house surrounded by her things which I have to pack up so her Sister can come collect them. I have been talking to the Samaritans because I have no one else. My Mother passed away 4 years ago and I have no contact with my Dad. My family structure is basically broken.

2. No contact. This advice feels a lot like telling a child not to touch a hot stove. It's so inviting, just do it. Every time you break this rule (willingly) you start back at square one. Don't believe me? See how you feel after you reach out to them...Yeah, it hurts. 

3. Get fit. Eat healthy. Drink less. A healthy body will translate to a healthy mind. How you look and feel about yourself is paramount. If you feel attractive

4. Get a new hobby. Study a language. Start Rock climbing.  Join a book club. Challenging yourself to learn something new will distract you from your usual thoughts. 

5. Don't be alone for the first month. Surround yourself will good friends and family. Keep the conversation focused on positives. Do not hang around with people who will nurture your desire to dwell on the breakup.

6. After the first month

7. If it feels like its not working...Don't rush things

Looking back it was a very unhealthy relationship in many ways. Don't get me wrong, outlining what he was willing to give. And, I took it. I always did. I took him back countless times after he would leave me sometimes for days. I always welcomed him with open arms, loving him immediately without reservation. I held out hope for so long that things would work. And, they just didn't. In the last month the stress and anxiety of living with an addict has taken its toll.

I want and deserve to be happy. I know I can be

I'm trudging the road to happiness. I'm processing and feeling all of this without self medicating. I have reached out to loved ones and friends candidly

I know now that I cannot be in a relationship with someone with an addiction or mental illness they are not seeking treatment for. It's a deal breaker and non-starter. Period. I am done playing second fiddle to bullshit. I have had enough.

The holidays are approaching. I have made plans literally for every day for the next week. I am leaning on essential support from those that love me. And,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,t3_12yrr7

1346726116.0,zbcom,This One Is For You /r/BreakUps: My Broken Hearted Manifesto,TheKeyThrowaway,24,5,5,"The following will be somewhat vague and brief. As I tend too ramble.

A young woman captured my heart and as she fell for me I fell for her.

It took 3 weeks of her eyes

I was intrigued by her life. She was from a broken home. With a broken family. The only strong member of a family consisting of a sex and drug addicted mother, a run away sister, and a little brother, to young to know how unlucky he was, but just old enough to feel sad about it and not know why.

I won her over with my charm and my storied past. I too coming from a place I'd rather not remember, but soft enough too never make her feel dumb. I picked her up from a broken series of poor decisions, I showed her who she was, who she could be, and what she was worth. When her family got in the way, I put them in there place, I taught her to do the same.

I loved her in a way I had no idea I was capable of loving. I spent most of my life, with one passion. And in a few months. She replaced it. And I was not bothered in the least.

The first time I told her I was in love with her. I was inside of her, tomorrow, or yesterday. These were strange words, with strange meanings. That I no longer cared for.

This feeling rarely subsided. All it took was holding her hand.

Five months pass and one day we wake up together

The next two months were not easy. I feared I would lose her to sorrow. I feared I would lose myself

But her mother did not recover from the loss of her first son. She returned to drugs. And to sex. And began to treat her daughter in a way that only the most broken of mothers do. Like a peer rather then a child. And as words got stronger

I fought. Literally. And emotionally. Time and time again. Against her family. Against her past. For her. And I would do it again. Or forever. But in time. I stopped being my own person. And became someone entirely different. I was no longer myself. I was simply

Months went by and we found ways around her mother. She moved back home, out of character discussions. Led to her revealing, she believed we should break up. I was in no position to argue. I asked why. She listed the faults I had recently acquired. She then mentioned, she really just wanted to go on a break. Something she didn't bring up, as in the past, I was always vocal about finding the idea of a break, pathetic

We kissed deeply, before we started depending on each other, for reasons that were not love.

I couldn't simply “Go on a break”. So I took this as a break up. My heart and my mind fractured, it was cold, and brief. And left me feeling empty. And terrible. I would consider this a break up. Because I feared the bliss brought upon me through hope. Hope, my heart broken readers, is a poison. And unless it is hope without doubt. It should be thrown to the wind. 
I came back into state. And when I pressured her for the truth, she needed time. 
During the three weeks I have sat and worried, and got my life in order. Daily, I heard rumors of ill doing. That she has been unfaithful, or that she has been spending time with the wrong people. Doing the wrong things. My sadness overtime became anger. And spite. And I almost let it control my life. I stopped eating, I stopped moving, or thinking, I wallowed in pure sorrow, writing this

**TL;DR** (If you came for the pick me up and not the story)

Tomorrow is my first day of school. My bed smells of her but is empty. Her pictures are still smiling at me. Her body is still casting a shadow on all things beautiful. And I am finding her promises more and more empty.

I’m done. With this. With what it may or may not be. With what it makes me feel. This is for you /r/BreakUp. This is for all my heartbroken brothers and sisters. For all my loving husbands and wives and fiancés and boyfriends and girlfriends. We are done. And we are going to be okay. And for the first time

We are better then this. Tell me why? Tell me why you’re fucking better then this?

I’m charming. I’m kind. I’m smart. I’m handsome and I’m fast. I’m loyal and I’m thoughtful. I’m creative and I have dreams god damn it. I HAVE DREAMS AND GOALS AND DESIRES AND PASSIONS AND I AM YOUNG AND MOST OF ALL I’M FUCKING BETTER THEN THIS! I’M SMARTER THEN THIS!

I’m nobodies fucking option. My life doesn’t stop when someone else stops caring. When someone else drops the fucking ball. My life goes on. Our lives go on /r/BreakUps because we are the fucking main characters. I don’t know about you but I’m nobodies fucking sidekick. I am not the antagonist, I cant fucking, breath or think, I’m going to take a deep breath and laugh. My heart may be broken, and my life may be on hard mode, but if I gotta run it solo for a mission or two so fucking be it. 

You beautiful

You met a guy and fell for him. I don't blame you for that. You can't choose who you fall for. You cheated on me, then that is your choice too and you deserve each other.

What I want to warn you about though is the situation you are leading yourself in to. I know you don't want to hear this from me and I have no right telling you now. But I still am a friend

Beginning a relationship with a co-worker is risky business. It's not necessarily doomed to fail but with a situation like this you should proceed with caution. It will be fun at first and I'm sure you're having a good time now. But as with us

You get to see each other at home and each other at work. Your life style will revolve around this. The relationship will move faster because of this and before you know it

Maybe you two won't work out? Maybe it will end? But all those moments you shared at home, you will feel terrible. 

There will be no escape. If the relationship ends sour... and we both know you're into him more than he is into you. So you are setting yourself up for a fall here. I know you don't care at the moment and you're willing to risk everything for this. I know

I know love is blind. You won't think about this now and it's just a process of life. But I do care, the best job you ever had. I don't know what this guy is like, I can only assume the worse (it's my job) but will he give up his job to make you happy? His job is disposable, yours is not. You worked hard for that position. Just think about what you're doing please!

My divorce happened four years ago -- the woman I was committed to, I ended it on my own. I miss my boy, but he's happy and healthy and we keep in touch, which is what's important.

Last summer, and I was looking forward for a chance to meet her in person, to deepen what felt like a strong bond, to finally touch and feel and know one another. I was even considering proposing, hoping that I'd found who I was looking for. That relationship ended a month ago: her ex-husband found someone else, and it appears to have frightened her into wanting a reconciliation, leaving me to watch my broken hopes crumble.

I want to give myself to someone. I want to be someone's white knight; I want someone who thinks she's just a lonely princess so I can make her a queen. I want someone's hand to hold, or hold onto in the silence of sadness or regret.

I want to be a part of something bigger than myself, someone to say goodbye to. I have nothing to give but myself, and no one I've found yet seems to want that.

Break-ups suck. Telling myself that ""someone better will come along"" is painfully hollow when I hear happy songs and see happy couples. Who doesn't want to be happy? Being content with yourself can be the hardest thing anyone can do

I know that it's easy to wonder if ""The One"" will ever come along. I've already lost The One -- twice. I didn't want the need to look for the proverbial charm; I didn't want to have to look a third time.

Yo jordan its jordan. If you ever start to miss tyler

Remember the reason she dumped you? Over religion! Dont stick your dick in crazy as they say. You wont have a meaningful adult relationship with someone who at a base level you cant agree with. She did you a favor as you wouldnt have to dump her later.

Another reason. She went back to cody loool. They are actually perfect together. Both pretty immature. Have the same interests . Batshit crazy with jesus lol. He can have her. 

Besides

Dont get me wrong though bro. Dont get mad or bitter at her. During your time together

Oh god and never bitch to her again. Jeezus you sound like such a little girl. Bottom line is: she truly liked you for who you are. Yes she did some messed up things

So to tldr: tyler is a shitty girlfriend for losing out on you

Although our relationship wasn't over a year long she was my first serious girlfriend and the first g/f I truly loved. I'm still not completely over her

* **Stop putting your ex on a pedestal.** When I really think about it, I realize there was quite a few things she did that I did could not stand but I continued to ignore them because I thought she was ""perfect"" for me and it did not matter.
* **There is more than one person for you that you are compatible with.**  Before your ex, there is only one that could ever work for you? Take it all as a learning experience as I am trying to do right now which leads me to my next point.
* **Learn from your past relationship.** I had some of the best times of my life and best first experiences in my past relationship, there were a lot of things that I have learned. I began to nitpick because she did the same and I wanted to ""get back"" at her for it which I learned was stupid. Also, being unexperienced I brought up her past more than I should have which is another thing I learned not to do in the future.  She had also done several things that bothered me that I know I will not want in a future S/O.  Once we got to school I always had to go to her place instead of coming to mine, I would only go out to parties with her if it was with her friends, and I catered to her needs entirely too much.  Just imagine what it will be like when you find someone that you love that gives back as much as you give to them.
* **Time and patience is key.** As much as people say it, but I know things will get better.  Realistically speaking you're not just going to find someone else instantly that you are compatible with and interested in, or else you wouldn't be here which again leads me to my next point.
* **Take time to better yourself.**  Do what is best to make yourself a better person.  I know it is said on here every day to improve yourself afterwards but that's because it's the truth.  Hang out with friends, but just make progress as the days go by.  Do your best not to slip back and talk to them again or look at their Facebook if you're still friends with them for some reason, it only takes you back to where you started and you have to make that progress all over again.
* **Don't fall into the friendzone**  As hard as it may be, whatever it is who cares.  If you can't see your ex with another guy or girl and be ok with it, then you can't be friends with them yet, that's not a friend.  I've been tempted to respond a lot, but I think about it and realize how if anything it will make things worse or the same as they were already, so what's the point? It's not necessary.

Yesterday I received word (unintentionally, she told me wasn't a threat. She told me he was a flirt, but that he was like that with everyone. The amount of time she spent trash-talking him is unbelievable. Now they're hooking up. And considering the stories she's shared from ""colleagues"", there's a good chance that it was happening whilst we were still together. I have been played.

Of course, begged for death, and cried until 5 in the morning.

I [M24] broke up with my SO [F24] almost 3 months ago after a 4 year relationship. She'd suggested a break, which she told me about. It was pretty clear to me at the time that this was no coincidence, and these new people were making her antsy about being in such a long relationship.

Anyway, it also devalues our long relationship. It sucks that she got over me because of some guy she hardly knew, especially since I met him and he was legitimately a massive douche (the kind of guy she would have laughed with me about back in the day).

I quit smoking pot and cigarettes immediately, well she was. Instead of being a lazy stoner, I've begun writing the novel I have been planning for years but never had the time too, and have started working out and eating right and managed to gain 10 kg, (a good thing in my case, I was well under weight).

After getting back to Australia several weeks ago I chose to contact my ex's mother instead of my ex directly about reclaiming somethings I had forgotten when I moved out (her parents always seemed to really respect me). And today when I met her mother to reclaim my items

She explained to me that since she left me for her drug dealer boyfriend, because after getting pregnant in December she hadn't even attempted to quit drugs. Her mother described her as constantly flustered and nervous, always on edge and miserable. She went on to say that her daughter seemed like a shell of the person she had been during her time with me, and that pretty much all the good that I had done for her in our time together had been undone by her new drug pushing boyfriend in a very short time.

Its was really disheartening to hear all that, and it seems I was right.

That's my main question. If you feel like reading the whole thing and giving advice, I can barely even explain my feelings anyway. 

I (19/f) just broke up with my boyfriend (19/m) of 10 months. 
He was the perfect guy but for reasons I can't explain very well, and the distance was hard. I was always the one who was unsure and thought the distance was so hard and being in a LDR in college was so hard, and he loved me unconditionally and still treated me perfectly despite my doubts.

But overall, but I did express feelings that I thought I was missing out on ""typical college"". I've been a big insecure and unsure because I've never really been with anyone else-besides kiss, he was my first absolute everything, my first love, and this is my first breakup.

I feel like I'm dying. I can barely eat, it's your first love, of course it's gonna be hard cuz it just happened, just get over it and find someone new. I want to be able to meet new people in college and have fun, yes, but honestly I would love to end up and marry him. He told me he wanted that too, and he meant it.

I know that any pain i feel from missing him or losing him, maybe it was just a rut. I feel so sad. I still love him so much.

I just don't know what to do. I could have tried to work on our problems

I feel like I made a huge mistake. But something made me feel like I had to

I told him and made a list of all the things I need to fix, because I know I'm selfish. Then pursue him and make things right; I know that sounds crazy and unrealistic. I know. But it's what I want for now, to have freedom and space now but go back to him when I'm ready. I know he probably won't ever love me again, anyway. 

Well if you read all that long, then thanks. I will try to elaborate if you would like. Thank you for any help

My friends, I would never climb out of the dark place I was in. She was a manipulator, giving me all the possible signs that she still loved me and wanted to be with me. At the time, with her being my own lifeline, I grasped onto whatever I could from her. I seriously thought we'd be together.... seriously. 

When I found out that she was still trying to douple dip (excuse the rude imagery)

Someone close to me said

I caved in and said fuck it; whatever I've been doing isn't working so I must swallow the pill and not speak with her for at LEAST two weeks. I was in the gym parking lot when I was told that phrase

There were times where I would dial the phone number, take a shower, do pulls up, and then go back to staring at my phone. I NEVER pressed dial. I NEVER sent the text. Two weeks passed and I was becoming whole again. I don't mean I felt better because I had been pursued by girls, I don't mean I felt better because I became more fit or because I had gotten a promotion (altought a few of those things DID happen, but as a consequence of what I had truly gone through). 

I felt better mentally. Subconsciously my mind was interracting with my heart and giving out signals that if I could get past my impulsive need to NEED HER, or if I won the breakup routinely. It only mattered that she didn't matter, and that was the breaking point. 

As I predicted and had imagine with some guilt, and apologized for being a bad girlfriend, she told me couldn't stop thinking about me. It DID NOT MAKE ONE DIFFERENCE. I told her that it was OK, that it didn't bother me anymore. She cried, she was pathetic. She left. 

Once again weeks went by

More texts came, seemingly, lives with my ex-neighbor). They went ignored. She once called while I was travelling abroad (actually, I still am travelling) and when she said her name I genuinely did not know who she was and had to ask for a last name. Do you know how good of a feeling it is to remind yourself that this person, who once was your everything, can become so little in such little time?

Today marks the one year and one day after my ex brutally dumped me over the phone. Being the awkward lonely girl I am

[Here I was

Here I am now.

 I moved out of my hometown and I started a new program last January. Right after our break up

I was never close to my parents

The new program I started is called Animation. The program is tough

I love every single second of it.

For the first time in my life I felt a sense of whole-ness. I was doing something I loved to do

In May a boy in my year and program asked me to help him pick up a record player downtown. I was in the process of moving to my current apartment in the same area he kept offering me to help me move stuff, then give me some of his extra kitchen stuff. One day, we fell asleep next to each other and he put his arms around me. 

I still thought about my ex often. Shortly after I started dating my current SO

It's been a little over 6 months now. My SO and I have little in common other than our passion for art and occasional overlaps in musical tastes. He's a total country bumpkin
For the first time in my life

School gets super stressful now and and again. I still think of my ex. I admit, I've really grown up. 

I tried to come up with some profound life advice but nothing I was about to type really worked or was totally true. I guess nothing really ever is. I guess, ""Once I have a boyfriend/girlfriend I'll be happy"" and that's totally untrue. Happiness is something that comes from within. It's not something someone else hands to you. I've always heard (from jason mraz I think?) that it takes two wholes to make a whole, not two halves and I think that's a wonderful way to put it. This is what NC truly means.

1344929067.0,y6xsg,Just broke up with my GF for the past 3 years. She was the love of my life. She was cheating on me multiple times.,Aaes,20,4,24,"We have been together for almost three years now
She's been treating me really bad

We met in high school, so we gave it a shot. It was amazing. I have never been happier, and I spent hundreds of dollars on tickets to go visit her 2-3 times a month. Everything was perfect, she told me that she was certain I was the love of her life and vice versa.
When she finished school, she came and lived with me.

So fast forward a year (march 2011) - we moved together. We were both very nervous, in my apartment. But we gave it a shot and it was amazing. She want's to become a cosmeotologist, but had a hard time finding a job here, so she could save up money for starting at school. So she didn't have any money, or any friends. I told her I would cover her rent until she found a job, and that the money was whatever (I'm a dental hygienist so my pay is more than decent to cover for both).

Three months later she went to Roskilde Festival (big music festival here in Denmark). When she came home she was so different, and one day she forgot to log off Facebook, and I saw she had been chatting with a guy, that she screwed at the festival. I was devestated. For months forward I was ready to just kill my self. But she still told me that she loved me, and that we were meant to be together, she was just confused, and it didnt mean anything. So we stayed together

Two months ago, and she said that they had nothing together and that she loved me. Then one day, she forgets to log off facebook, and all hell broke loose.

For months she had been texting this guy, in my bed. Telling him how when she was in bed with me, she was thinking of him. I snapped, I felt so sick. I couldnt believe this was happening, and that she did this, and then when she came home, she told me that everything was good between us.

So last night, and she didnt care for me anymore. That was it I couldnt handle it anymore.
I have spent almost 1

So now here I am

**My story:**

* I (24f) was in a relationship with this guy (32m) for 1 year. He was my first love, amazing chemistry; everything was perfect except the emotional aspect of it. He was emotionally unavailable and thought more with his head than heart. I on the other hand was an emotional person, so this caused issues because he didn’t “try” to understand me as a person. I did everything for this guy, I bent over backwards, and I let a lot of hurtful things he did slide. Long story short, he broke up with me saying I lacked life experience because everything I am going through he already has and he doesn’t want to be anybody’s teacher. 


* The day after he broke up with me, I deleted his number (even though I memorized it lol).


**Week 1:**

* This was the hardest week of my life because I reached to one of the lowest points in my life. I’ve never cried so much and my heart was aching so badly. I just wanted the pain to go away, except cry.
I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t eat. I would go to sleep crying and wake up in the middle of the night to the thought of him and cried some more. Everyday every second I thought about him and the good times. In my eyes he was perfect


* I kept blaming myself for the relationship for ending, if only I just kept my mouth shut. I wished I could turn back time. 
How I was able to not contact him was because I read online that if I did **NO CONTACT** I would be able to get him back

* What kept me somewhat sane during this week was talking to my friends about my feelings and sleeping over at my friend’s/brother’s house. I couldn’t be home alone; I would have driven myself crazy in thoughts. I cried everyday that week


**Week 2:**

* The aching in my heart decreased, but I was too blinded to see it and also because every wrong thing he did I made excuses for it and tried to justify for his wrong doings, so it didn’t seem that bad at the time.


* The hardest thing I had to accept was that “he and I weren’t meant to be”, so how can this be true? I use to think that if you treated someone right and gave them your all, that that was enough to keep a relationship, boy was I wrong. Even though he might have been perfect in my eyes, he wasn’t perfect for me. I am a loving, giving person and that is the type of person I need to be with. 


* I got a job and this helped time pass by so much quicker. It sometimes help occupied my mind

* I also made a CD full of songs about getting over a breakup, I felt what the song was trying to convey.


**Week 3:**

* *Trust your struggle, but not as much about the good times or the good things about him, but of how he really isn’t that great of a guy. I started accepting that things were really over at this point, the hope of us getting back together is almost gone. 

* I signed up for Eharmony because I wanted to get myself out there and just get to know people. I’ve gone on 3 dates and I’ve made it clear I wasn’t looking to jump into any relationship. I don’t want to hurt other people or use anyone as a rebound, but I kind of had to step out of my comfort zone. 


* This week there was a few times I wanted to call him, and if anything was going to change it would have to be him. 


* Sometimes I think that if only I was the person I was now when I first met him, they are who they are, you need to find someone who loves the same way you do, or else you’ve never fully be satisfy in the relationship. 

* At first I went into **NO CONTACT** with the mindset of getting him back, which is good because if he did it would have ruined my progress. I am now using **NO CONTACT** to heal myself and better myself as a person.



**The story:**

* This was the hardest experience I’ve ever gone through, so the next time someone treats me wrong I am not going to put up with it. I now have standards and I won’t settle for less. I am more cautious with how much I give. I am stronger and wiser now, and if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have become the better person that I am now. I now know what LOVE is…

* I went through the 5 stages of a breakup “**Denial, Depression, and Acceptance.**” I repeated the first four stages many times, but I’m slowly getting into the acceptance stage. TIME is really the answer to all our pain.

* I did everything I could for this relationship and I didn’t have it in me to keep fighting it. Sometimes things just don’t work out the way you hoped it would… but it will work out even better. You have to start letting go of what ifs and maybe because if you don’t then you’re not allowing yourself the chance to let go. You can’t keep feeding yourself possibilities

* Life will throw surprises at you

Feel free to ask me anything


**EDIT**

I still miss him and at this point

I know it's hard guys and you probably think you won't ever find anyone like him, but he isn't! The perfect person wouldn't leave you hanging, they wouldn't give up when things get hard. 

*GROUPON* I found some classes on there for a really good deal. I am taking yoga to keep myself busy!

I did more research on breakups. I was snooping around my Ex's FB page (she never changed her password... I'm an idiot) and came across pictures of her with a guy she's hidden from public. Photos can mean a million things, I promised myself to never do that to myself again.

Anyways

* [Link 1](http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/breaks-breaking-up/251986-grass-greener-syndrome)
* [Link 2](http://www.enotalone.com/forum/showthread.php?t=265952)

Basically

&gt;This is different from Mayday11's thread because the dumper leaves the relationship to pursue another relationship with another person. Not because they want to be free or enjoy life...etc. This type of relationship usually occurs immediately after the breakup, boring, and predictable. They start to wonder, what else is out there? Is there anything better out there? Is this all I'm going to have for the rest of my life? 


Link 1 has these symptoms of the breakup:


* Reasons for the break up are contradicting or sound like the dumper is grasping at straws for reasons. As if they are trying to convince themselves of it

* Not much warning that something is going on before the actual break.

* An extreme change in lifestyle

* Wishy-washiness on the part of the dumper. They love you

* Quickly entering new relationships with people they aren't very compatible with.

The end gist of it is that the dumper may enter into a new relationship fast. The honeymoon stage of that relationship will be over and as time goes on, the ""grass is greener"" feeling will wane and eventually the dumper will realize how much better they had it with the ex.

Every suggestion has stated that there is really nothing the dumpee can do besides move on while the dumper experiences these new found freedoms. 


* **What I like**

In my personal thought, has experiences completely new things. A new full time job, graduated college, hanging out with her aunt more and more, going out more and more (she used to have a curfew, believe it or not), and meeting about two dozen new faces and people.

It does accurate describe how some long term, one does start to think about other options in life, especially when they are confronted with a new set of friends, social circles, and lifestyles. Can my current BF/GF work with what I seem to want in the future? Or are there better options out there?

* **What I don't like**

What I don't like about G.I.G.S. is the thought that the dumper will ""realize"" the grass ISN'T greener on the other side and come back to you. People change, but most likely not come back to you. Maybe for the dumper, the grass is greener. But there is also the saying that ""the grass is greener where you wet it the most""... not even sure what that means.

On a personal level, I just wonder how it'll hit her to not have a birthday without me. G.I.G.S. is disheartening for me, since it offers no solution besides to move on. But every solution tells the dumpee to move on, so that isn't new.

It didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Today had been an awful day for me (for many reasons), and even she agreed that she didn't look as pretty. Maybe it was her hair, maybe it was the make up. Maybe it's the fact that I'm moving on, or the fact that my best friend is lying to make me feel better (which in this context isn't really bad), I'm glad that I didn't break down or anything. I know I'm not completely over her, but I'm also happy to know that I'm not in that can't-live-without-her stage anymore. 

I'm not encouraging those who aren't ready to go look at their ex's pages, and your anxiety levels tone down at thoughts of your ex. 

I know for many of us, but for most, it won't. What's important to realize is that the world has so much to offer to us; we need to seize every opportunity, and realize that while grieving over our exes is normal (even healthy), doing so obsessively could blind us to meeting someone who will actually be *better* for us.

1367332943.0,1dev8c,Used and tossed in the trash.,0theraccount,21,2,50,"If anyone takes the time to read this

So, F) broke up about 8 months ago. It was the absolute worst break up of my life. I felt like I was going to die. I cried every day. I cried at work. I cried myself to sleep. I cried when I woke up, I cried in the shower. I just couldn’t get a hold of myself. 

We’d been together 3 years. We had a home together, (inappropriate messages) he also tried to hook up with one of my friends one night when I wasn’t around, and he was just not being a good boyfriend in general. He never spent time with me, even though we lived together. He worked like crazy, would come home late at night all the time. He is an alcoholic also, when we *did* go out together, he’d usually end up embarrassing me by getting ridiculously drunk and doing something stupid. When I found out about the Facebook messages

I was devastated. Even though he did all these terrible things, even though we hadn’t been happy for a while. I couldn’t imagine my life without him. But he left me anyway. He moved out of our apartment and cut off all contact with me. Just like it was nothing to him. It was so painful… I moved out of our apartment a month later (couldn’t afford it on my own) and moved in with a friend. I fell into a deep depression for several months. It wasn’t until around 4 months later that I started feeling better. Started dating again, etc. All the while, my ex and I having no contact. (Not that I didn’t try… I tried several times over the first few months to get him to at least talk to me, to no avail).

So flash back to about a month ago. I texted him for the first time in several months… and said I think we should meet up and talk. I want to try to be friends or at least call a truce. We have a lot of mutual friends (we live in a very small town of about 11

A couple weeks went by, and then texted me at the last minute to tell me he couldn’t make it. But all the while he would still text me. (Usually at nighttime… when he drinks). One time he even texted me at nighttime and said “I want to meet up, but I’m going to have a hard time with it. I’m still super attracted to you. I still think about you every day, I don’t enjoy what happened between us”. I knew he was drunk when he sent me that text, but it still gave me some hope.

Then one Saturday night, and I got bold. I texted him and said “You know what, let’s just forget this whole thing. You’ve been telling me for weeks now that you want to be friends and you want to meet up. But you clearly don’t, because it hasn’t happened yet. So I’m calling a deadline finally. If we don’t meet up this weekend once and for all, then let’s just forget the whole thing.” 

He texted me back right away (VERY unusual... normally it would take him several hours

He met me at the door. We hugged and said hello. It was hard. He looked *good*. He said I looked good. He reeked of booze. He was clearly hammered… I was drunk too

We went and sat down and ‘talked’ for about 10 minutes.  Next thing I know

Then he said something really strange to me afterwards… he said “Do you feel bad about yourself now?”  and I was like… “what…” and he said “you just slept with your ex boyfriend. Do you feel bad now?” and I jumped out of bed and started gathering my clothes because I found that very offensive and confusing. He said “I didn’t mean anything by that I’m sorry. Come back to bed”. 

We fell asleep cuddling after. I woke up the next morning and walked home… I left as soon as I woke up

He texted me later that morning and said “did you get home ok” and asked me if I was ok with what happened. He kept text me all day (sober) and making small talk with me and he said “No regrets right?” and I said “no of course not

So then he didn’t contact me for 3 days. I was waiting to see if he would

Now back to the making plans and ditching me thing again. We made plans about 5 or 6 times. And they never happened. He kept telling me why he didn’t have time, etc etc. 

After about 2 weeks of me trying to make plans with him again, and now you’re done with me again. I have to say, that makes me feel pretty used and hurt”. He texted me back and told me once again, that he really does want to meet up and talk, and we will meet up this week. I said how about Saturday. He said ok.

So on Friday night (this Friday that just passed) I was at a friend’s house. (Who is a mutual friend of his and mine). She asked me if I had seen him yet since the night we spent together (she knew what happened). I said no

She said I have to tell you something, he slept with another girl… (Specifically, a girl who doesn’t have a very good reputation around town). I couldn’t believe it. I never thought he could do that. And the weekend after he slept with me, was one of the weekends I’d asked him to hang out. He’d told me that he was driving to a city that was 7 hours away to pick up his sibling from school. Guess that was a lie.

So I’m pretty upset at that point, it’s a Friday night, and this man has already caused me so much pain. I told myself if I’m gonna get upset I’ll do it later in private. 

So my friend and I know of this party going on that night in town. She knows I’m upset after what she just told me and says “Do you want to go? We don’t have to.” And I said “Fuck it

Felt like a fucking knife through the heart. I wanted to jump out of the car and run after him and kill him. The amount of humiliation and hurt I felt at that moment was unbelievable. It’s one thing to hear it. It’s another to see it. My friend and I ended up going in to the party even though I just wanted to go home and cry. But I tried to stay and make myself have fun. I lasted about and hour

I get home … get my phone out, how could he do this to me. I even sent him a screen shot of one of the text messages he sent me where he was proclaiming how much he missed me. I sent him a screen shot of that and said “Remember this?” I told him I don’t understand how he could just use me that way. He *knew* I was in love with him still, and he saw me as an easy lay, and took it. And then tossed me out like a piece of trash. I said I don’t understand how someone who was supposed to be in love with me once could hurt me like this. I even said I would still forgive him... how pathetic of me.

I said if you are seeing this girl, that you *still* didn’t want to be with me. Instead you kept making plans with me, and stringing me along, and leading me to believe maybe you still had feelings for me. I then I find out you’re fucking this girl? And then I see you leave the party with her tonight holding hands as I’m pulling in to the party… do you have any idea how cruel that actually was?” It said a bunch of other stuff too, but that was the gist of it. The part that killed me the most, was while those messages were getting sent to his phone, he was lying in bed with her most likely.

I went to bed at about 1 a.m. and bawled my eyes out for a good hour
The next morning I slept in late
Of course he hasn’t.

I sent him a text and said “you have absolutely no conscious. You don’t even have the decency to answer me…”
And he replied back “Omg

It took *everything* in me not to reply back to that. I wanted to send him a nasty text message telling him what a fucking pig he is


So that last communication was on Saturday morning. And that’s the last I’ve heard from him.

I feel like an absolute fucking moron for being so naive. For thinking that maybe he still felt the same way about me. For thinking our night together meant the same thing to him that it did to me. 

I don’t know how I’m gonna get over it this time. I can’t get it off my mind. I’m having a hard time focusing at work. I want some way to make the hurting stop because I really honestly didn’t think there was any new ways for him to hurt me

I was doing okay-ish after several weeks of NC. It felt like I was slowly moving in the right direction

Then he actually did send me a message, and that he wanted to fix things between us. He just wants to be friends now, that's all. This wasn't a surprise to me, it's what he said when we broke up. I'm just a friend to him. 

Those words shouldn't cause as much pain as they do, last night was one of those times where I *needed* to cry, because there was nothing else I could do. 

For any of you out there having a similarly rough night, then congratulations on being over your breakup!

It was four years. It's been three weeks.

By the end of it you were as exhausted as I was. The jealousy, but it never did. You were vocal about your pain and I was hoping it wouldn't destroy us, but that was futile. I will regret that decision for the rest of my life and every day I think about what my child would look like today.

I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life. You will never know that I was ready to propose. We talked about it from time to time and you always seemed excited. Sometimes I think I waited too long

So now here we are. You have your life and your things, on the other hand, can't. I want to know that all this pain and suffering will somehow make you happier in the long run without the assumption it will. How else am I supposed to know this without contacting you? I know you are too kind a person to leave me hanging if I started talking to you again. So it is essentially up to me to make sure I don't break my promise and leave you alone. This is infuriating. 

I don't care about how I feel anymore. I've accepted that I will never be as happy as I was with you and I am oddly okay with it. At least we had the time we had together and hopefully you are able to find a better place to be than with me.

I don't regret helping you move and painting your apartment for you. I don't regret spending all the time I did and money I did on you. I don't regret trying awkwardly to get to know your family to improve relations. I don't regret cooking you meals for school. I don't regret the trips we took. I don't regret buying us a bed to sleep in together

Somehow I know I've come way from this a better person. Maybe not happier and definitely not as comfortable, but you have helped me prove that wrong as well. Thank you.

A part of me will always be waiting for you, do great things, raise a great family, and have a wonderful life.

Goodbye and good luck

1364923269.0,1biyt9,To Everyone going through a Break up,Spidros,23,4,13,"Hey everyone

""First I would like to thank everyone for the happy birthday wishes and apologize that it took me this long to respond to all of you. I have been going through a break up and it really hit home for me. I have been feeling down the last few weeks since before my birthday. I am writing this to tell everyone something and open up to tell everyone who I am and what I stand for.
I lost my father 2 years ago, she was “seeing” my best friend Patrick. I remember telling my dad when it was just him and I that “She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen”. After Patrick and Marissa called it quits after a few months went by I started talking to Marissa and her amazingly unique son Merrick. I spent time with them and I truly fell in love with both of them.
With her I was able to open up and truly find myself and who I can become. With her son he showed me that it’s not always about discipline but showing how to do something correctly. They opened my eyes in many ways
I am currently in the bad state of mind, Caring, Loyal, Trusting, and I work hard at everything. I am that guy that would give some stranger money by over hearing a conversation that they had saying that they spent their money on having a wonderful time with friends but don’t have enough money for gas to get back home. I do things for people to see them smile hoping that they will turn around and show another complete stranger the same generosity I gave them. I guess I am rambling on. I want to fight for what I want and love. ""  


After that post I realized after my phone blew up from my friends and family all of them where crying because of what I wrote. I was always the person to turn to when needing advise. Now I guess that was me asking for help and realizing who I am and what I stand for.   It made it a lot easier for what just happened. Text with her basically saying that she was pissed that I used her name and her son's name. I told her Sorry but everyone on my fb knows who you are. So I asked for the rest of my stuff back

Knowing that its over I feel fine now. Because that person that sent me the texts was not her. Not the person that I fell in love with. It gave me the courage to tell her not to text me not to call me. I gave her permission to check in on me in 3 months. So that gives me the goal of using this time to focus on my self and Work hard for who I am and who I want to be. So that when she checks in with me I can tell her to and show her what she missed. And look at her and see where she is at and say this is where you could have been with me reaching my goals you lost everything.  

I have the power I have the strength

Something that I guess made me focus and realize everything, I am Strong, I have loved, I have lived, I know who I want to be, I am loyal, I am trusting, I need to find myself again and help myself become stronger.


So if any of you need to talk need to hear someone's voice to help you to motivate you to be there for you. I am always willing to help. If you want to call me text me or skype chat me I can and will be there for you. Just Message me.

The reason you need to get into no-contact mode is because you need to get used to not having him around. Very

Most people say find a new hobby
For example

1. I downloaded 5 books and told myself that no matter what I need to finish them in a month. And these are serious books

2. Work out at least 4 times a week. No excuses. And also have minor weekly gym goals [example

3. Finish up with some paperwork that I've been postponing forever

4. Some work related goals 

5. Bake some cookies for coworkers


When you tell yourself that no matter what, there's only 24 hrs in a day. Tire yourself out every day, so that when you lay your head on your pillow you'll fall asleep within 10-15 minutes.

Chin-up. Things will get better.

To be honest I'm not really sure I need helping

I just got dumped from my first real relationship. It was only a couple of months long, and on the day she came back she dumped me. Said she feels like she needs some time to only have to worry about herself for a change, she needed to be single. Pretty simple really. In the end, it's over, the details ultimately don't matter. It was all very civil. I'll miss her.

What's struck me most is that in a way, but in the end I'm thankful to have spent the time I did with her, even only for a couple of months. 

Before I met her I'd never thought myself capable of being in a relationship. I overcame that with her. I got over my issues with intimacy. She overcame her trust issues. I think we both left each other better than we were.

The thing that strikes me most is this though, there chances are, overwhelmingly, that there are more.

It's been three days. While I'm not exactly planning on running and finding the nearest girl to start something new with, but there is no such thing as an everlasting relationship. This isn't a reason not to get involved though. in a way, the finite and fragile nature of these little connections you forge with others is what makes them so special.

In a nutshell, but I think most of the time the badness is worth it because of the good.

I have been posting and spending a lot of time here recently as I am currently going through a break up (as are a lot of us)
 

What we are going through/gone through is hard


Let me give you some insight into who I used to be and will be again


Im a 26m, on the spiral. But as much as it hurts, as much as I am a mess, I know that this will not always be the case, I just have to find myself again. I'm in here somewhere, 
always have been.


I wanted to share with you guys a story about my most fucked up relationship. This is not the current heartache I am feeling now but several years (and several girls) before. I'll try and keep it as brief as possible. 


I went to a university where the ratio of girls to guys was 1 - 8. It was in a shitty little town and I saw a lot of people around me turn to drugs and alcohol to ease this. Lets just say it was not a very inspirational place. Luckily for me though my home city was only a 40min train journey away so I could go home at weekends and catch up with my friends and family, and do photography.


However, I felt I had made a huge mistake but I kept at it. I'd come from a world of a huge social scene into a tiny inhospitable place where the elderly came to die. 


I digress. 


So anyway, and yeah I ended up back at her place. 


I guess I should of started to sense something was wrong from the start


So we start doing the usual stuff you do, this time however, she tells me about her and her ex bf who is still living with them, but having a hard time about it. I think ok EX bf, bit strange but its ok.. Until I got a punch in the face. 


Fair enough I guess. Still silencing those warning bells. So a few months go by, but I fell for her, although in hindsight its hard for me to understand how that happened, I guess I was just happy I wasn't lonely anymore plus all the sex. Ok so, lets get to the really fun to read, really fucked up parts.


This girls, I knew she partied a lot but I trusted her. 


This wasn't kept hidden for long though


Things got really fucked up after this. 


It all started one night when I was having a guys night, 'No one hurts my woman, I will save you!' going through my head. She tells me, its not far across the city centre so I bid goodbye to my friends and run like hell to her. 


When I find her she is in a mess, crying her eyes out. She lived in the city so it was only a short walk home... a walk which involved a lot of her shouting at random passers by, but i got her there eventually... without getting punched (achievement unlocked!). Once we got into her apartment, thats when the fun really began. 


First thing she does is crack open another bottle of wine, then in a dark voice starts talking about jumping out. 


""you know I wont let you do that.""


So I move to the window next to her to grab her if she tries anything. After a while of this she locks herself in the bathroom and wont speak to me. I'm trying to text my friends to get some backup if I need it


When she comes out she is bleeding, but instinct took over and I new I had to get plasters or bandages on the cuts, something she really did not want me to do. I get some and try to put them on her, but this ends in shouting and eventually a look in her eyes that make me think she is considering attacking me. However something changes in her head and she allows me to dress the cuts and put her to bed.


Lets just say I didn't get much sleep that night. The next day we went out for breakfast and she was obviously very very ashamed of what had happened. I'm a fool


After that, then when I got pissed of turned around so it was all my fault, it got to a point where I eventually had enough and left. This wasn't the end though.


I still cared for her, I'd done shit I was depressed and I had no job with no prospects of getting a job in the field I had studied (thats ok though because I have finally found my passion in life). Argh digressing again.


Right, I still thought I could help. But I was trying to stay away. 


Until one night. I will always remember this night, yeah it was bad. 


I was at home drowning my sorrows with my brother playing some computer games
Even after all these years I still remember this message word for word:


""It's my time to die now

WTF!!!! I freaked, no answer on the house phone. Shit! I can't let her kill herself!! I've got to get over there! 


I had £10 left in my bank account, as I walked down the road I saw sitting on the street just outside the entrance gate a figure. I knew it was her, I got closer. This is what I saw:


She was pretty much lying in the street in a short dress no coat


Ah. This is bad.  


I couldn't get much sense out of her but I new I needed to get her inside and patch her up, she was still pretty out of it but she was crying and telling me how it had all happened whilst I cleaned up her cuts, put plasters and bandages on. I can't remember exactly what she told me but basically it was all drug and alcohol induced. 


I managed to settle her down, and they talk in that quiet cold certainty? 
Thats exactly what she was like


""Yes! Yes I will help you! We will make sure you get better."" I replied

""I don't think you understand. I want you to help me commit suicide."" She said in a cold voice full of certainty whilst staring directly into my eyes

""No! I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening."" 

""You can't be here all the time


Then she got naked and tried to have sex with me, this was all going mental. 


As I was rolling my smoke in the living room of the apartment she tried to make a break for it. She ran out of her room, so I walked towards her slowly telling her I wouldn't let her leave. She was screaming about driving back to her parents house, I tried to take the keys, she almost attacked me, and finally got out the door. I chased after her. We were in the landing now, and she was heading for the elevator. She pressed the button, I got there, I stood so that the doors couldn't close


She sat there sobbing and occasionally shouting at me then crying more. I just sat there staring at her


I was thinking about what I could do, and just looked at me. I told her that was it, I was going and left. 


I got a text from a friend of mine asking me to go check on her bf who was ill (he is also a close friend). When I got there I told him everything that had happened. 


In the end, it was all a manipulation game. 


Why am I writing this? 


At the time I didn't see any effect on me psychologically and I was wondering what that was going to be. Well it has, when things go bad I freak out, over thing and assume the worst, it has given me some trust issues and I guess I'm always waiting for the craziness (I do seem to attract them). It has taken me loosing my last SO to realise that it is time to get some help. It wasn't those things that drove us apart, I don't want to go into that. But this has made me think it is time I confronted things from my past to make my future better.


I hope if you are reading this then you never have to go through anything like that, wasn't totally fucked up to the point of insanity. If I can get over that, I can get over this. 


If I can get over that

Any questions or PM's welcome.

Can I allow this feeling?
And then answer. It doesn’t matter if it is a Yes or No.

STEP 2: Ask “Could I let this feeling go?” Again

STEP 3 Ask “Would I let this feeling go?”

STEP 4 Ask “When?” 

STEP 5 Now examine the feeling again. Does it feel different? Did you feel a shift? The shift is different for everyone

The Fast Forward Technique should not be a struggle. In fact

You will want to do 2 or 3 sessions a day. One session may be 5 or 6 repetitions or more through the 5 steps.''

We spent Friday night together. I was happy

We hung out again on Sunday. I overcame my fear of rejection and told her what I wanted, that it wouldn't be the same as before, that I wouldn't use her as a crutch. She agreed to give us a shot, if we went slow. I was fine with that. Between that, and my parents calling off their divorce that same week, I was ecstatic.

Tuesday, I initiated nothing. But...she kissed me in the kitchen. And grabbed my hand in the car. And as the day progressed, my cautious optimism became full blown conviction, that I was doing the right thing, that we would get back together and be happier for it.

But , and my new found confidence slowly faded. Tuesday was to be our final chapter, but I didn't know that yet. I convinced myself that she was busy, that she had shown her true colors on Tuesday. 

Finally I broke down, apart from her disapproval of my drinking habits, that it was nothing. She said she still wanted to try. And then her texts grew warmer, and my optimism returned. She left town for a convention. I stayed on campus and hung out with friends and had a great weekend, apart from some unfriendly yellow jackets and a punch in the stomach. 

She returned on Sunday, and the divorce was back on. I called her, wanting to talk about it and perhaps grab some dinner. Then it happened. 

She didn't want to try anymore. Her ""effort"" lasted 6 days and one 5 hour hang out session. She had decided over the weekend. She said she wasn't entirely sure

I don't hold it against her though. She's doing what she thinks will make her happy. I want her to be happy. Even if I'm crushed. It feels like too much weight to bear. Everything was looking up; my family was staying together and I was to have my first love and best friend back. It was a week of bliss. I walked around with the biggest smile...

Then, and I was cast back into the void that had taken me 3 months of therapy and many destructive decisions to emerge from. I feel a little better than I felt yesterday, but I know this will be another roller coaster ride. And sometimes...I feel like I don't have it in me for another ride. But what other choice do I have?

When I got into her room she was curled on in a ball looking out of her window (facing away from me so she didn't see me come in), or maybe her expecting me not to show up)

Long story short, and when she refused to have sex with him he forced himself on top of her. I won't lie, it reopened a lot of wounds for me. But as suggested in the comments of my previous posts I was able to ask her why she couldn't do the same for me when I was need. And I got my answers.

1) I left the country and went on an adventure.  Still here in fact, I have essentially cut myself off from home.

Well, that's impossible from here, nor can either of us just hop a flight to go see each other.  It's helped, believe that!


2) Every time the ""good times"" pop in my mind, the AWFUL times.  I realize now that I have some distance, there were just as many terrible times, mostly due to incompatibility with our personality and life styles.  It reaffirms the fact that the break up was healthy and a good decision.


3) Turned it in to a positive by making this a new phase in my life where I am learning about myself, I'm thinking, I'm hiking and being alone in the woods every day


4) Figuring out all the things that I couldn't do because of being in a relationship, like hiking, so I would refrain from those to make him comfortable.  Now I hike all the time!


5) From the first day, one or both parties just have this ""fuck her/fuck him"" mentality where they are angry, often over simple misunderstandings.  I realized, someone breaking up with you doesn't make them an asshole.  We all have one life to live, and we should try to be happy.  If someone is happier without me, that doesn't make me or them a bad person.  Also, I don't let myself deny that my ex was such an influential part of my life.  I look back on our relationship as a beautiful addition to my life history.  But it ended

In these first few hours, there's one all important truth that you need to recognize: Some things can't and shouldn't be fixed, especially that loser who dumped you or forced you to dump him. It's over for a reason, and even if you're in denial about it, deep down inside you probably know what the reason is. Even if you feel baffled by his decision to end it, it boils down to the same thing every time: Your relationship, despite it's promise, in effect

So take a deep breath, moody, angry, depressed, nauseated - you name it. In fact the amount of time it takes for you to start feeling great about yourself is directly proportional to how much it sucks right now - especially if you weren't the one who broke it off. Because at the end of the day, someone you loved, trusted, and that really smarts. It's hard not to take it personally. 

But here's the important part - the fact of the matter is, no matter what you may or may not have done wrong, you are still a kick-ass person.

We had been together for 5 years, she first to stay with her best friend for a month or so while we found a place. Then I would come up with all of our stuff. 

We made it about two weeks into the separation before she made it permanent. My whole life, The good, the bad, all of it just vanished. Apparently I hadn't been close enough. Apparently I was supposed to read her mind and know that she was unhappy. 

Two weeks later she's being wined and dined by some guy. I still can't keep food down and barely drink enough water to sustain life. I throw away everything that isn't essential to me

Since then I've progressed. I moved back to the town we used to live in together. I've started my own business, physically. I still cry sometimes, in the shower, or when My roommate isn't home. 
I still kiss our matching necklace before I go to bed

But I've made progress. Today she popped back in to town. Out of the blue. She wanted her stuff from storage, that soft, beautiful skin of hers, like velvet lightning when it touched my own. Her hair touched my face. It was like the finest lace, woven for the gods themselves, yet here I am, a mere mortal man being graced with this gift upon my brow.

**I couldn't do it.*

The tears came. My breath caught. It took everything I had not to pick her up, please for the love of god and all things good in ths world to please take me back. That I'm better than I was. I'm stronger, better looking, smarter. More successful than I had ever been! Please! **PLEASE**

But I choked down the beast known as love. And I think I hate myself for it.

She got her things. I could see it in her. A few times when we were talking. when I handed her her old stuffed bear. When I looked into her eyes. She almost broke down. Her breath held
 But she doesn't love me anymore.
   *But she doesn't love me anymore*

**BUT SHE DOESN'T. FUCKING. LOVE ME. ANYMORE.** i don't think you get it. You see, love is a bond unbroken forever trusting, I don't give MY FUCKING LOVE to just anyone. I knew when I met this girl she was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

*She said she would love me forever.*
*Hah. What a joke...*

*I hate being the punchline.*

So she got her things

We stopped at the bottom of the stairs. I held her one more time. I kissed her on the forehead

But no such luck. I didn't wake up. *Damn it all.*


She said she was sorry for this.
I told her she had to live for her
I told her I didn't hate her.
She told me I should.
I told her I could never hate her, severely hurt by her. But not hate. *Never hate.*

Here is the comment:
&gt;Well then, try a little variation on a nifty little thing called _cognitive reappraisal_. 
&gt;
&gt;Science bases what I'm about to describe on three things: one, a brain is almost completely incapable of separating vivid fantasy from reality. Third, writing something down has a more lasting neutralizing effect on your emotions than just thinking it.
&gt;
&gt;That kept in mind
&gt;
&gt;You say you hold grudges
&gt;
&gt;That's right, more believable and more effective treatment than any of what is stated in the above post. Read right on to find out what it is.
&gt;
&gt;Follow these quick and easy steps to get your very own peace of mind:
&gt;
&gt;1. Think of a person that has wronged you.
&gt;2. Write them a letter, leaving absolutely nothing filtered or censored. Remember, this is your fantasy. 
&gt;3. Write back a letter to yourself, an explanation, appreciation -- everything you feel you'd need in reality to stop feeling resentment towards them. After you've finished this letter, sign it as well, again in their name.
&gt;4. Read back this second letter every night before you go to bed over the course of a week. By the end of the week, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing. You will be able to treat them as if they've righted their wrong, because even though perhaps you don't cognitively believe it, you do feel that emotional satisfaction and relief.
&gt;
&gt;Now then, and it'll work all the better because of it.

1367521914.0,1dkhje,My Ex is a piece of shit.,CheeseWithCheese,23,8,8,"Sorry for the length. I need to get this off my chest.

We broke up like a month ago. Pretty much right away I realized that he was verbally abusive to me. I had been questioning it for awhile but when we broke up I came to the conclusion that yes

About a week after HE broke up with ME, and at that time I completely cut off contact with him. Our talking back and forth had lasted a few weeks. 

It was then that the stalking started. He would wait for me places, come to my room, send me messages and texts. 

And then yesterday I came to the realization that along with all this shit, just like he mocked my Christian beliefs in general. He is the shittiest example of an atheist.* And I know that I shouldn't hate him; my beliefs tell me I should love everyone. I simply cannot help it though. He *ruined* me. Or, he tried to ruin me. Even though he told me I am a weak person whenever I cried, I am not. I am so, so strong. I am stronger than I ever thought I was.

And now he wants the shit that he gave me for Christmas, after everything he's done to me? **Fuck him.** I cannot stand the sight of him. It pisses me off that he stares at me during class. Everything about him pisses me off. 

I cannot wait until the day that he finally stops talking to me.

*Edit to say that I don't think that Atheists are bad people; I'm just saying that he is one of the bad ones

Edit 2: Now that I've had the time to calm down, I am hurt by what he did. I can't trust him, but one day I will forgive him. I don't know if we can ever be friends again. We'll see.

We were best friends. We lived together for three of those four years. We had a kitty together (that I kept after the breakup). We talked of commitment and marriage. He was my biggest pillar of support, and no one knew one of us without the other.

But it just didn't feel right. I fought for two of those four years with constant doubts and overwhelming thoughts that made me not enjoy the relationship. I went to therapy, I truly did. But I could never commit myself to him 100%. There was no one else I wanted, but something just didn't seem right.

We had a trial seperation for a few weeks before we fully break up, not at this point of my life. I'm just finishing my third year of Engineering at school in a few weeks, and I'm due to graduate next year. I've barely experienced LIFE.

Please believe me, it didn't feel right. I can't commit to settle down with someone I was just so unsure with. So after so much fighting, at the end of it, I just took a deep breath and walked away.

I've posted here a couple times now following the break up I have been dealing with for over a month now and other personal issues. I've been severely depressed over this and some personal issues going on with my family. 
I won't go into too much detail as far as the other things go, and that's when I thought about this analogy that made me feel better:

Think of relationships almost like waves. Most of the waves eventually make it to the shore and recede back into the ocean

Now imagine that you're a surfer. To those unfamiliar with surfing, balance, endurance, and strength among other things. One of the best feelings after I learned to surf was finally catching that first wave. I finally found the right balance and positioning on my board to stand up and ride a wave. I felt on top of the world and capable of doing anything. Of course, if you lose balance, it is easy to fall off and wipe out. Falling off and losing that first wave was a bummer, but I never looked back and got all sad because that wave was gone. I look back and remember how amazing that feeling was

So how does that relate to relationships? I just got out of my very first relationship and it was tough. All I wanted to do was do anything to get her back. I lost my balance between her and my relationships with other people and lost control of my friendships to be with her. In this case, potentially catching that next wave with now the experience gained. Don't regret and think too much about what caused you to fall off that wave, but learn from it so that next time you can stand up a little while longer and maybe even stay on it all the way to the shore. 

I suppose what I'm trying to say is don't think that the one wave that you catch is the only wave you catch. There are tons of waves out there for you try your best and catch. All it takes is to get back up on that board

I think that this analogy can be applied to a lot of other aspects such as dreams and goals,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,t3_1b2tmq
1364257453.0,1b0d04,Almost 8 years together building a future...done in 3 months,Omnivirus,18,3,12,"I think my title is likely misleading because things have been brewing for more than 3 months.

I'm 34. My wife is 26. We've been together a long time. 8 years to be exact. She is the best person I know. The brightest light in my life and the sweetest most caring woman I've ever met. Someone who loved me from the start without reservation. The kind of person you dream about.

7 years of bliss. Total happiness. We got married last year and it was the best day of my life. Everything was perfect. We were in synch in every way you can think of. 

And then things changed.

After our honeymoon, and enough room to plant an enormous vegetable garden.

We moved in and it was perfect. It was tiring

And then the hammer dropped. Right before New Year. 

'I'm unhappy and I don't know if this is what I want in my life right now.'

'You've given me everything I ever wanted...and now I don't think I want it.'

We spent New Years apart. She with friends in her hometown. Me

A long time ago she told me to never stop fighting for us, never showing up until Sunday evening. I had a wife from Monday to Friday, and then someone who didn't want to be with me at all on the weekend. I was a glorified roommate.

We fought during this time. Usually about weekend outings. Sometimes about money. Every time I talked to her it was like walking on eggshells. I'd ask myself - is this was marriage is supposed to be? Is this what love is? Was it always like this and I just never noticed?

It wasn't. She had changed.

She always (and still) maintains that she loved me. That she still loves me. She hasn't done anything in 3 months to make me think it. Sometimes I think she's bipolar. On Tuesday she'll talk about having a family and the cute kids we'll have. On Thursday she'll tell me I'm overreacting because she showed up home after work at 11pm without explanation. 

Sometimes I believe that I overreacted. Most times I know it's insane to think that.

Ultimately

Family has helped. Friends have helped. But the one person I could always lean on before...that I could open my heart to and ask for support hasn't been there.

Yesterday we came to terms with it and said it was over. It was cathartic. It hurt. It really hurts. I spent the day at work today not working. Thinking about everything. Love is simple. It really is, no hesitation. Everything else is peripheral. But we always make it complicated. Like we want it to fail.

I'm scared of the future. I don't know what it will bring. But I'm not alone

My girlfriend broke up with me because she said she wanted to find out who she really was and not feel like she had to depend on anyone. She also mentioned she would like to date other guys and that she was interested in another guy. We were together for two years and I thought everything was perfect. 

When we started dating, but I wanted to help her get better. 

Well she thought I was superman for a while. She thought I was the nicest person in the world and all that jazz. She said she saw a future with me and all that stuff

All of this was a huge surprise to me and it was very unlike her. I would have never thought that she would be the one to end it in a million years. I get the whole thing about not wanting to depend on anyone... no one should feel like they need to depend on someone else to be happy. But I don't think that needs to be the end of a relationship. I think that you can find out a lot about yourself while you are with someone... Whatever. I have mixed feeling about it. 

Right now, she leaves me. 

Anyway, and didn't feel sick to my stomach ALL day. No contact thing has been tough, but I hid her on facebook and stopped following her on other social networking sites. It is hard to not look at her stuff, but it is making thing a hell of a lot easier. I started working out... something I hadn't done in a structured way since we started dating (though I ride my bike everywhere and love to rock climb so I was in decent shape). I have been doing *okay* these last two days. She is still on my mind 24/7 and I still get angry when I think about her talking to another guy, but I can honestly say that I am starting to look up for the first time. I don't think I want her back anymore and I now know for sure that everything will end up okay in the long run. I still am having a hard time losing my best friend. I think that is the hardest part. But this has happened to all of us, and just knowing that helps me get through it.

11 years of my life committed to a college sweetheart whom I stuck with even when he became a controlling, stuck with him even when he ballooned into a fat slob who had no qualms pointing out I'd put on a bit of weight or didn't dress attractively enough. Stuck with him when he was a fresh grad, skint on money, and we had to do the long distance relationship thing because I was still studying abroad. 

And now that my family's fucked up genetics have finally caught up with me and bestowed upon me (mostly) high functioning bipolar disorder, but hey, apparently putting on one dress size since college is unacceptable), now that he's a corporate hotshot raking in shit tons of money, lost weight and has girls throwing himself at him while he works an ocean away - the fucking coward, instead of telling me straight up he doesn't want to be with me anymore because hey, way to look like the bad guy who dumps the bipolar gf now that he's moving up in life right - over the course of the last few months - stopped telling me he loved me, stopped holding my hand

I text him to wish him a safe flight back to the country he's working in

So I gave him what he wanted but didn't have the balls to do and initiated the breakup. I deserve better than being treated like shit now that I'm no longer the trophy girlfriend he can't believe he scored all those years ago.

And he responds with something like *hey

Fuck him and his platitudes. It's been 4 days and I've not heard a thing from him. Be there for me. I could have killed myself for all he knew in the time he spent ""being there"" for me.

The healing process is difficult but I'm doing better than I thought I would. Generally I've been doing pretty okay most days. I've been trying to be with other people as much as possible

But sometimes it just hits me. He knew breaking up with me would mean having no contact with me ever again. After four and a half years of being so close and going through so much

I just don't know how he's okay with never touching me or sleeping next to me or holding my hand or so many other things with me ever again. I can't understand it.

But then I realize he did not treat me well. The way to deal with my sadness is to override it with anger at him for the many things he did wrong, and the dynamic between us was really messed up. He would get mad at me and say such hurtful things even if I was crying and begging him to stop. He would have such unfair expectations of me and never consider that he had plenty to fix himself, especially toward the end. It was always about what I was doing wrong. He'd make a half-assed apology about his own behavior but the focus was always me. He has no idea the damage he did to me and us. Breaking up with me has freed me from a lot of bad shit.

They helped me realize that I was very codependant in my relationship

In a span of five days, was accepted into my program, found a flat downtown at a good price, and regained my old job. On top of that, I nailed an interview for an internship (which is unfortunately near her, but there are always downsides) and start that in the summer.

What I'm trying to say is, and don't be afraid to do anything in your power to get it back. Be strong, independent, and motivated. 

I called her once three days after the breakup, I got the picture. I boxed her stuff up (threw it out a couple of days ago), and blocked her and her family on all social media. That starts the healing process.

I just wanted to share how I am currently dealing with my break up and maybe it will help someone.

To get ""over it"" something snapped in my head, enjoying the moment. That and that i shouldnt kid myself in thinking i was happy, because no matter how much I fought for us, deep inside i knew i wasnt completely happy and didnt deserve the way i was being treated and I found myself wanting more for myself and became hungry to take a bite our of this world.

I had goals once and i stopped working on them when i started loving him, and too crazy in love to want anything else anyways in the world. 

But one cannot be lazy and give up on goals

At some point you need to stop letting your emotions of selfpity boss you around and do the right/logical thing, get a better job, go to school, get into that hobby you always wanted, read more books or anything. For your own self growth. And same socially, work on yourself, be the person people find funny and want to hang out with, be an example for friends who are going through breakups too, its not gonna be easy if you approach it like its a chore

I still love him but when thinking logically

Another tip that helped me through all the turbulence was constantly reminding me ""what would Spock do?""  and to handle any situation, no matter the snappy or hateful things you would rather say.

The future is bright

Watch the sky, stars and the moon, its not only beautiful but it gives perspective about one self and our problems in this gigantic universe.

It was in that moment I realized just how much better off I am without him.  Why was I so hung up on a person that didn't care about me in the least?  Why had I believed this boy that had repeatedly told me he loved me

Fuck him.

Since then (that was a little less than a month ago) I have learned exactly who and where my friends are.  I've realized just how much I let myself be changed by the ex (and the one before him).  I woke up and realized that I am a great person, people I would have never expected to care.  

This week I moved into a new home.  I'm not homeless anymore.  I returned to the city where he and I lived together, walked right into where he used to work, and shopped.  I didn't see a single person I recognized, or that knew us, and it felt great.  Last week I went to dinner with a coworker and her friends that I did not know previously, and I had a blast.  I bought a ticket for a concert -- right now I don't know if anyone is going with me and I don't care, I'll go alone.  I'm going to a Reddit meetup on Thursday at a bar -- maybe I'll make even more friends!  I'm trying to round up some people to go see ET in the park on Wednesday.   I set up a new OK Cupid profile, and we text constantly and are making plans to travel together.  I'm getting back to the person I was a long time ago

Need guidance on how to make things better.",17,"I broke up with my GF about year back after she cheated on me. I lost my best friend (and a few others) as well in the process due to complications I don't want to dwell into. Most of my other friends are married and too busy with their personal lives. Or they are no longer in the same city as I.  

I had two short term affairs in the last one year. The first one sexual in nature and I couldn't emotionally connect with the woman. I lost her when she got serious and I couldn't handle it. The second woman I connected with was emotionally a little more satisfying but she is way too young for me and our life wasn't heading in the same direction. Besides

I stay alone in a house I lived with my GF for 3 years. It is a constant reminder of the times I have spent with her. I am unable to move out as it is going to be a painful effort (too many things) and I have been trying to get out of this city/country if possible. Besides

I have a nice job that pays me well and keeps me busy. I however don't like bringing people in my professional life to my personal life outside of work. I have had a bad experience with this in the past. Besides

The last one year, learnt to play the drums and gotten good at photography. I have tried to keep myself busy doing a lot many things.  

However, I am way too focused on it to prioritize and seek out social connections. I prefer for things to happen naturally. Hitting a club/pub to pick up women isn't really an option. It just doesn't work that way in this country (hence the attempt to relocate from this place).   

I am 31 now and I feel the need to find one woman and settle down. I am at loss of ideas on how to make this happen. Even worse, my loneliness may drive me to accept her back even I rationally know that this isn't the smartest move. This knowledge is quite disturbing as well.     


EDIT: Things have gotten to a point where I am unable to perform my chores because of the strong feeling that everything I am doing is a cheap substitute for human connection. I don't feel like attending to my routine because it is becoming very monotonous. And when I stop doing this

She got off of drugs (pills) and onto suboxone

I became suspicious, I chalked it up to paranoia.  We had great sex, hours of sex in one night.  Foreplay, oral, ropes and toys.  In the shower, on the floor, in the woods

As she was unemployed I helped her find work

The whole time she inflated my ego with tales of how wonderful I am.  A few more random guys happened (I didn't know this at the time).  Then my co-worker happened

I had locked myself in the bathroom with her phone

Now armed with the truth

5, that I stole every penny she earned and spent it on myself. (Reality is that I payed all the bills &amp; gave her spending money) some of the text I read she actually had convinced these young men to come the her defense. To do me harm.

She was using drugs with them you see. And my money would afford them more pills.  And she was telling them that my money was actually hers, but I don't do other drugs.  I rarely even have a drink.  She was going to have me robbed,  maybe beaten, maybe killed.  Just to get high one more time.

God that is hard to even write.  To actually put down in words and see it staring back at you…

It happened like three days ago.  And today was his birthday.  We had plans.  We were going to spend the day together.  Yeah

He was my best friend.  Is? Was?  I don’t know.  God I miss him so much. And I just want to call him up.  I just want my best friend back.  But I have to remember that I deserved better than what he gave me.  Memories can tend to cloud the brain

I have to remember that he didn’t want to travel.  That is all I want to do.  I'm getting my Master's degree in International Studies!

He Smoked!  I hated it.  And many times he had no regard for my feelings when it came to the smoke

He had a fucking gambling problem.  Like serious, for months I worried about him.  If I didn’t hear from him I drove myself crazy with worry that he was at the casino.  God this relationship was such a mess.  The only reason we lasted so long was our friendship and my force of will.  It should have ended sooner.  But it still hurts.

He would never walk with me or work out with me.  UGH!  I hated this.  I need that support, not someone who will bitch and moan as I plead and needle them to just come on a walk with me around the block.

He didn’t cherish me.  He DIDN’T CHERISH me!  And I fucking deserve to be cherished.  Not overlooked when times are difficult.  I deserve ALL of your love and ALL of your attention.  I am fucking worth it!

And honestly, but our sex life was NOT that great.  Seriously.  Sex is not over just because you finished.  At times you were a very selfish lover.  Maybe you should learn from this.

We sit talk every night and I try my hardest to work through whats troubling her but she doesn't have any answers and over the week she just seems to be pulling further away each day.

She says she doesn't know whats up with herself and that shes feeling depressed and shes not sure if she ""loves me enough anymore"". So she decides to move back to her parents for a week to try and get her head straight. I tell her I love her completely and that I will give her the space she needs to sort things out.

She then comes back to our apartment yesterday and sits down and tells me its over and theres nothing we can do to fix it. She rattles off a list of all these issues with our relationship that she said had been getting her down for over a year, theres no longer any trust between us, we have been growing apart etc etc.

So...shes moved all her stuff out and the only trace of her and our nine years spent together is the engagement ring left on the bed.

Its so hard to even know what to do with myself now. I'm going to have to sell the new car we just purchased because I won't be able to afford the loan repayments without her salary contributing.

Hey Reddit. I usually lurk but had to make an account to get this off my chest and hopefully get some advice/perspective...

TL;DR We broke up

I dated a girl for a little over 4 years. We got off to a great start and that momentum never really slowed down between until the very end of our relationship. We were both absolutely insane over each other, but it was very definitely in our cards for the future).

So things got bad in the last I'd say 4 or 5 months. Stresses with work, too. We pretty much let our time and experiences together take a back seat to immediate issues that were mounting up to being more and more difficult to overcome. After so much time together we allowed ourselves to get to a place where we were perhaps too comfortable with each other and didn't take full advantage of what we had.

So, on this I believe her absolutely). She told me this, and in a teary and emotional next few days we broke up so she could have some time to figure herself out and grow a bit more and her own (and me too, though the break up was mostly her idea).

So here's where we are now, while I did grow, learn, and better myself overall mentally and health-wise (thanks, r/keto!) I have not been able to stop thinking about her. At all. I've spent time alone with myself. I've gone out with friends, I've met new people, and even dated and found myself in a couple different relationships - of which none began out of the desire just to be in one - but every time I'm with someone all I can think about is my ex. She's just embedded in my mind.

I've tried accepting it and confronting it

I don't want to add more damage to how I'm feeling

1367801317.0,1drgzs,[20F] I got dumped and now I can't trust anyone.,songbirdlamb,20,3,15,"In March

I have emotional problems

I thought maybe if I gave him a few days to cool off things would be fine. So I contacted him again a few days later and he said he wanted to talk about it and meet me. He picked me up in his car and we talked about how he was doing badly in school and how he thought his friends hated him, and then he broke down, started to cry, and said that I was right and that he missed me and all that bullshit. He wants to get back together, so I'm happy, and I told him only if he's sure and he says that it's what he wants.

We go back to his place, he tells me that he actually doesn't want to get back together and that I forced him to. Even though I really, and I swear on my mother's life, I never forced him to do anything. I didn't hold a gun up to his head, I didn't threaten my own life if we didn't get back together, all I did was say that I didn't want to break up. All he had to do was be a man and stick with his decision. But no. Instead, he pretends as if he's really happy to get back together, and then conveniently waits until after he has fucked me to tell me that it's actually not what he wants and that I should leave. 

I've never fallen out of love with someone so quickly. I'm disgusted with him. I was mad at first and lashed out. I was angry, I feel bad for him now and I'm just trying to make sure we both get out of this okay at this point. Then he kisses me. Which is confusing. I don't want to kiss him back, but I feel like if I don't he'll freak out, so I do. And then he smiles and says he'll miss doing that and I tell him that I have to go, but he seems better. After that we agree that we can be friends and that we can still help each other out if either of us needs to talk. Well the one time I go to him for help, he freaks out and yells at me, telling me that he's not my boyfriend anymore and that he can't listen to my problems. But of course all the times he's contacted me to talk is perfectly fine

My problem is that I can't get over the fact that he is in any way happy with his life now. I really feel like a woman scorned or some shit like that. I'm angry and I don't think it's really fair that he used me and then sent me through emotional torture for a month until I told him I didn't want to hear from him again. I wish these were the fucking middle ages and that women were the dominant sex so I could fucking nail his dick to his forehead for this bullshit. I've actually never been so angry at anyone in my life. I don't see how it's fair that he gets to keep going on about his merry way, lied and manipulated me, and then threw me away like a piece of trash. As a child who grew up without her father, I already have abandonment issues and even though he knew this, he did it anyway. So what do I do? I guess just keep ignoring him and hurting? How do I trust other people? I want to start dating again someday and I really don't know how to go about doing that. I literally feel sick to my stomach when guys ask me to hangout and I've turned down a lot of people who have asked me to go out because I just don't feel ready yet. But if I were to prepare myself to be ready to date again, what would I do? Should I just have lots of sex with guys I don't have to see again? Should I not be having sex at all? Am I crazy? Are there other crazy people out there? Am I going to die alone? Just someone tell me what the fuck I should be doing.

TL;DR: My ex is a pussy. He dumped me. I don't know how to trust guys anymore. He has actually given me a prejudice against the opposite sex.",,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1drgzs/20f_i_got_dumped_and_now_i_cant_trust_anyone/

The first 2 years was wonderful as we felt like we were inseparable. I know this is probably because of the “honey moon” stages. I know she loves me with all her heart and would give up the world for me. However after a while I just became lazy
2 weeks ago she told me and pointed out the obvious. Things were not going were we wanted to be and she broke up with me and ignored all my text and calls. I didn’t get any response from her until I waited outside her house all night. I told her I was sorry for being such an idiot and I took advantage of her. I told her that I still loved her and I cared for her and I actually meant it

I know I was an idiot and a really shitty boyfriend. I took advantage of someone I love and broke her heart way too many times. I feel like a complete idiot and I regret hurting her. I know it’s a good thing for her to leave me. I didn’t give her my all and I regret it. I’m sorry for not calling her at night and not communicating better with her. Not telling her how I feel. I didn’t give her the attention she required and I regret it. 
For guys out there that still has their girl by their side. Please don’t be like me. Please call her and tell her how much she means to you. Please tell her that you love her and wants to spoil her rotten. Grab her and hold her in your arms. Tell her you cherish her and never want to let her go. It’s really true you don’t know what you have got until it’s gone. I have been really depressed since she left I know I brought this on myself. I just don’t want anyone to feel the way I do.

We went out for 1 year and 2 months.

I'm a M [20] and she's a F [19].

So, unpack my things and relax and watch TV. Well she finally texts me asking me when I would get back, and I told her I just did. She told me she'd be over soon. She came over and we talked about eachothers break, had sex and told each other that we loved each other afterwords. She was acting funny though sometimes, but I just thought that because we haven't seen eachother in a week that it was just normal. Well she gets tired really early and asks if we can go to her place to sleep and I agree. We go back, sleep and snuggle, and then wake up and go to classes. 

Now my second class comes around and in the middle of it I get a text saying we need to talk. I ask her why she can't just tell me in a text and to just text it to me. She tells me she fell out of love, and finally when we get to my room I ask her why, what happened, that I love her more than anyone and I'll do anything to keep us together. She just looked at me cold, didn't shed one tear and just told me shes moved on and doesn't love me like she used to. 

That almost two months ago

Now she leaves and I just lay in my bed crying, and told me that she didn't like it (lie) and that it had nothing to do with dumping me.

I kept begging for three more weeks, phrases, anything to get her back to me. I started searching the internet for answers, what to do, how to get her back, and I read many places that it was to start no contact. So I told her that I needed to fall out of love with her and started not talking to her. I still loved her and thought to myself that she would surely miss me and want me back eventually. Well four days pass, and I break no contact telling her I can't have her out of my life. She responds that she miss me and asks me to come over and I started jumping for joy.

I came back, and so I beg and say give me one week to win you back and she eventually agrees. Well this just lead to arguing and me trying to talk to her about us when all she wanted to do was watch Netflix or do her homework while texting her friends. I tried being intimate with her again when we slept together but she'd just say stop I want to sleep and so we slept. Now after three or so days of this trial I felt like I couldn't take it anymore and told her that.

So I start no contact again and then last two or three days and come crawling back to her telling her shes the one and I need her more than anything. She says she wants me back but can't. I ask her why and she tells me because of David, got drunk and fucked him.

This made me so angry I called her awful things, telling me she wants me back, that shes so sorry and that she made an awful mistake and that we can get past this. My friends all tell me to ignore those texts and I did that night.

Well, etc..) and went over to her house to give it to her. 

Then I do a stupid thing and have sex with her again. I'm not going to say I didn't love it

I finally stopped. She was my first love

Block her on facebook, because right now I'm trying to find it and get it back.

She cheated on me, we had fights near the end of our relationship. I became lazy and boring to her at the end. But nothing constitutes cheating. And its my own fault for trying to get her back. 

I dragged my broken heart only for it to get raped by a pack of wolves. Once she breaks it

i was shocked because he was the one that seemed reluctant to keep the communication open (a request i made before i decided to do NC)

then i spent the rest of the night talking myself out of calling. making my friend give me every reason not to call him back. and i resolved not to call. but then today at work... my resolve weakened and my curiosity took over. so today

he asked me how i was doing. we caught up a bit about what we'd been up to over the past week/weekend. everything was very cordial. he said he wasn't sure if he should call and that he was conflicted. he wanted to be there for me but he also realized that he was the source of the pain. he asked me how i felt and i told him that i appreciated him checking up on me and that i was happy

i don't know how i feel. i'm happy that he called and i'm happy that he cares but at the same time it hurts. it hurts because

i know i shouldn't have answered. i know i shouldn't have called back. and i don't plan on calling him again. i was just so curious about what he had to say. i just wanted to indulge myself. and the call didn't change anything, i really do.

I also cooked

 I'm by nature somewhat of a shy person, including some of his close friends.  Without even getting to know me, while he was staying with them for a while (I was busy with work), they tried to convince him to leave me, and upon returning he told me that he almost listened to them and thought about just not coming back.  I was floored, but I calmly stated my feelings on the issue, and that was overcome. 

As the years went by, I'm not a ""looker"" by any means, and have always had self-confidence issues, and he seemed to be aware of that.  However, in one particular instance, we were looking at bathing suits when we came across one for women (it was a style that was the new fad at the time, very skimpy and revealed the navel without being an actual bikini).  I noticed him being rather enthralled with it, but I don't think I could rock that look.""  His reply was ""Oh

He was in the Air Force for about five years some time before we met, rightfully so.  However, I have had an extremely difficult life, and have had little opportunity to do anything quite of that magnitude, despite many smaller accomplishments over time.  He would often make it a point to tell me that he had ""Done far more than I had previously, so my achievements are better than anything you have done.  You have not used an ounce of your potential throughout your whole life.""  He was dishonorably discharged for talking back to a superior in the Air Force, and has not had much of what could be considered a ""real"" career ever since; this hasn't been an issue in my eyes, while I was working on getting into college

One day, I had no idea that the lines for the school offices would be quite lengthy, and sadly I was stuck in the building for an hour or so, but I was doing what I needed to do.  Upon returning to him, where he sat comfortably in the car with the A/C and the Sony PSP I had given him, he immediately began to complain that he ""Doesn't like to be kept waiting, no matter the reason, rent-free

  After being accepted, which he also critiqued, despite my attempts to say that sometimes people realize their limitations and change their minds.  I graduated in 2009, and sadly I have never been able to become employed in the field I studied, so I moved on to a local university, where I have also studied diligently and would consistently get good grades (I have been on the Dean's list multiple times at both institutions), and subsequently my hard work paid off in the form of earning extra scholarships that went towards our living expenses.  In 2010, and things really began to look up.


Over the course of two years, and my brother and I were tasked with ensuring that she received proper care at home, made it to doctor's appointments, bathe her, etc.  Understandably, my husband seldomly assisted with many of the duties involved with taking care of her, however, going to school, and being available for marital activities

 At one point he began to keep his twelve-pack of sodas right underneath his computer desk so that he would not have to get up to get a drink; the only times he would stand up were to use the restroom, and they noticed that he seemed to have a problem as well, as all of them have said that any time they have seen him, he was at the computer.  It might be safe to say that he has had an addiction to computer usage and gaming, and there were many times where I tried to help him out by mentioning that his lifestyle was not very good for his health, using polite and concerned tones.  There have been many days where I would become extremely worried that he would have a heart attack, or something of that nature due to his extremely sedentary lifestyle, he vehemently denied having any problem of the sort.  


Fast forward to September of last year (2012)...my grandmother had deteriorated to the point where my husband, this put a decent amount of strain on our marriage, as my brother and I had to leave our jobs and focus on caring for grandma, while at the same time attending college (husband, brother and myself were all enrolled); I developed a schedule that ensure that everyone had time for what they needed to take care of, be it school, helping with grandma, but that was about it.  For the entirety of his college career

 A few days before my birthday in September of 2012, and found her extremely out of it, lying on the floor, in a very confused state, partially nude.  She had slipped a bit in the bathroom, hit her head on the counter, and confusedly turned the faucet on and left it running for a number of hours, I learned that she was in the throes of a stroke: we would later find out that she had two strokes back-to-back that day.

  My sister, she sent a barrage of hurtful text messages, saying that grandma would have been better off if I weren't one of the ones helping out with her, that I was doing a bad job of helping, that I was only after grandma's money, etc.  As a side note, grandmother had given my sister $4, something that many of my family members have never even dreamed of or wanted to own, something that I was definitely not envious of

  On the day of my birthday, after grandmother was released from the hospital, it was decided that she would be moving across the country to stay with the one of her three sons that has spent the least amount of time with her throughout his life, and he and his family are much better equipped to take care of her (my aunt is a former registered nurse), which was difficult to hear because I would be very far away from someone who has always been there for me, but I went along with it fully, knowing it would be the best for my grandmother.

  Up to that point, and with her leaving, that would no longer be happening because it would not have been fair for her to be helping with our bills since she no longer resided in the same household.  I had absolutely no qualms with this, and immediately set to the task of finding work in a tough economy while still attending college.  We tried to find other roommates, sold many of our belongings, yet still were unable to sustain the household, and on January 10

  My husband and I stayed at a few hotels for a week and a half using our student refunds while trying to find a new place.  After this, he promptly told me that he had found a room in an apartment with some roommates, and that he wanted a divorce, and some of his exact words to me were ""You have no home to come home to, Jane Doe.""  My heart literally felt like it broke in two, especially after finding out that he had been wanting to leave me for two years prior to that.  This was in late January, and ever since I have had to rely on the good graces of two very close friends who have been letting me stay on their couch while I try to get my life in order.  He has toyed with me a few times by saying that he might want to get back together

  He doesn't have the funds to file for a divorce, and also stated that he had given up on me a long time ago.  I admit that I'm not a perfect person, nor am I very good-looking, but I have worked extremely hard at making our relationship work, as well as contributing pretty much all of my time to taking care of the household, and he has left me pretty much homeless and on the verge of losing my car (I had to take out a title loan to ensure that we could move into a big enough of a house with my grandmother last year), my things in storage, my college career (my grades are horrific this semester).

  He still has no job, failing to recognize that during separation each spouse has a right to equal and separate living arrangements.  I can't afford a good lawyer, and he says that if I contest the divorce, he would have many claims that would make the courts rule in his favor, so he is pretty much trying to blackmail me, despite the fact that the claims he brings up have no validity, and I have people in my life who can attest to that. He has even told me that he is ""perfectly fine without me."" 

 I want desperately to work things out, I have been faithful to him, and I was pretty much always happy to be around him.  He is an intelligent individual with the capability to be very romantic, and we have spent a great deal of fun time together, yet he still has his computer/gaming time issue, no job, and continues to do badly in school, yet he seems to be completely unaffected by ending our relationship

I have done everything right:

-I've only broken NC twice. Once to deliver his things to him (contacted him to set up a time with his roommate to return his things) and once to let him know I needed to delete him and all his friends from FB so I could reactivate it without the constant, and transactional interactions. 

-I have gotten shitfaced only once since the break up. My birthday was 3 weeks to the day after he ended it, and was carried home by my wonderful roommate. Since then, I have not drowned my sorrows in drink or drug or anything else.

-I am in therapy. I have been since May of last year, and although it hurts I respect his decision.

-When I felt I was ready, but it felt good to get the first time without my ex out of the way. I broke things off with that guy yesterday. I do not feel sadness or regret for sleeping with that man.

I don't feel any real passion or fire in my life, or that spending one day a week with me was too demanding. I no longer feel loved, but I also don't feel neglected.

""I can't say that this message takes me by surprise since you were talking to my friend last night. My worry is that you contact me when you're lonely and realize you lost someone.

Yes, or you're just sorry for being that way. Being with you was a burden and as sad as I was when we broke up I was also very relieved - which is why I am hesitant to respond to this message. I really don't want to get dragged back into this emotional turmoil. I'm unsure about what you're wanting from me at this point.

1355421594.0,14smvz,My (24m) plans after a 5-year relationship with her (24f),devilized,16,0,11,"I never imagined that I would be making a post about personal issues like this

Some history: We met Freshman year of college, we moved in to our own apartment. Spent about 6 months apart while she finished up a last semester, and I moved to NC for my job. She ended up getting a job down here as well (same employer), and moved down here too. We decided to buy a house at the beginning of last year. House and mortgage are in my name since she didn't have established credit, but I've put a lot more money into it than she has. 

When we first met, but was managing it well. She had all of the traits I wanted in a partner - logical, geeky, down to earth, a sense of humor (however limited), responsible, caring, didn't have expensive taste. We spent a lot of time together - hanging out and talking, walking the dogs, and rarely argued and when we did

A year or two ago, but everyone told me that it would change. A few months ago, we bought up the possibility of marriage. We had been together for a while, and everything was going seemingly well. The topic of kids came up again. While I don't foresee wanting kids now, I am open to the possibility that my priorities might change in 5-10 years. I told her there is a decent chance that I would be okay with kids when I was 35, but she wasn't satisfied with that since it had become a very high priority for her future. 

Now that I look back, but was having second thoughts. I asked her what the reason was, and she didn't have one and she was confused, so we moved on. The night before last, I walked into her office in our house and she minimized a couple of screens pretty quickly. One was a chat window with a male colleague of hers. I know she's been talking with him about us, but I don't know what his/her intentions are. I'm confident that she was not cheating, but I don't know what motivation he played in her decision or what either of their intentions were toward each other. The other looked like some sort of text document about me. I asked her about the document, I noticed she had that look

Even though I knew it was coming, etc). My mind is racing with the uncertainty of the future. I no longer feel a since of happiness/satisfaction/complacency. I've lost my appetite. Menial things like cooking, which I used to enjoy, have become a burdon. I know this is only temporary, and I'd like to make this feeling pass as quickly as possible. 

Now

**What I will do**

* Allow her time to find a new place to live, separate bathrooms and slightly different work schedules. 
* Split up our joint assets. She'll take the stuff that she uses most
* Cut off all contact with her and her family. She didn't want this, but after 5 years, I think this will really help me cope. 
* Eliminate reminders of her. I've done much of this already. Removed pictures of us, canceled flights to visit her family, putting away items that have a significance in our relationship. This will be much easier when she's out of the house.
* Prevent this person crisis from negatively affecting my job. I need to keep my head in the game and move on. I usually do a good job of keeping my personal life out of my job
* Step up my social activities. I'm very much an introvert and I keep people at an arms length. My dad blames this on me being an Engineer. I spend a lot of time volunteering for Habitat for Humanity as a House Leader
* Spend more time away from home. Plan a long motorcycle trip with a colleague that I ride with. Head to the shooting range (haven't been there in a while). 
* Get my finances in order. Need to re-balance my personal budget now that I'm paying the mortgage on my own. 
* Be healthier. Eat better. Work out more - not just for physical reasons
* Learn from this experience. She was critical towards my ""pessimism"". I viewed that trait more of preparing for the worst
* Embrace the support that my family has offered. I've had a difficult family situation
* Move on. Embrace the opportunities that this opens. That might be in the forms of amazing career opportunities that I previously turned down so we didn't have to move. This event bring the opportunity for a fresh start


**What I will NOT do**

* Make any big decisions that will impact my future for at least 6 months, moving somewhere else) are because I'm heading toward an opportunity, and not running away from anything.
* Pursue or commit to another relationship until I am happy being on my own. I know this time will come, not to fill a void or attempt to solve loneliness. 
* Bury myself in work, but my Dad talked me out of it. 
* Spend Christmas alone. I had originally planned to head up north to spend Christmas with her family
* Do anything retaliatory. I don't hold negative feelings towards her. My decision to cut off contact despite her objections is not meant as some sort of 'punishment' towards her. It's completely to help myself
* Hold resentment. I don't feel like I've wasted five years or anything. I don't see her in a negative light. Given our age when we started dating
* Blame anyone, not mine.

Vices can be anything: Masturbation, flirting with a stranger, waving back to flirtatious strangers who wave at me, actually smiling at people who compliment me rather than brushing them off coldly, doing ""single people"" activities, accepting dinner dates with friends of the opposite sex, etc -- I give into one or two within reason.

For example: Today, in fact. But the freeing feeling of smoking one, going against my own rules, going against *his* rules -- I can't tell you how good it felt. Lighting up a cigarette *just because* made me think, ""Holy crap. I belong to no one right now. I'm single, no one can tell me what to do, and this is *my* life to live."" It was sort of like a celebratory vice -- not smoked because of some vaguely FMLish reason

This is my life!

I started to have a good day. My little ""fuck you"" cigarette set me on a glorious path to enjoyment. I was laughing with my friends. I was compartmentalizing the emotions of what I was going through just as he told me he did

Progress gets easier in time. Every time I found myself staring into the distance and dwelling on the pain, a soy chai latte, a good book, awesome music, working out, cooking, dancing, doodling, more natural

I'm getting there.

**He texted me today.**

He told me that he hoped I was doing okay. He told me that this was hard for him.

I thought I would be happy to hear from him, remember me? The man who broke your heart over and over, and who broke your heart *again*? I don't actually want to get back with you, but I just want you to know how I'm feeling so you can continue to support me and be my emotional blanket while I move on.""

Fuck him.

How dare he message me. What happened to no contact? What happened to him saying

Fuck him.

Must he really work to set me back? How dare he stomp on my progress? How hypocritical of him! If I can't message him

I feel like he's torturing me. I love him, and enough is just enough. I'm too fucking pretty to be wasting my time drilling deep-set wrinkles into my forehead because of his bullshit. I work hard for my body and for my mind -- I deserve to be appreciated by someone who will love every inch of me, inside and out.

But I can't when he's fucking up my life by forcing his way into it.

I don't know why he's reaching out to me after so vehemently warning me away from him, but selfishly continue to keep me on a leash even after we've parted, he doesn't *deserve* my worry or affection. I refuse to care about someone who hurts me so recklessly, and who carelessly handles my heart.

What he does with his life is none of my business

**He knows I care about him.**

I don't have to tell him or remind him anymore. I told him enough times while we were together -- I'm done telling him. If it wasn't enough for him then, or telling him what I'm doing. He doesn't get to be in my life anymore. He doesn't have the privilege to poke his head into my business, much less tell me what to do.

For once, and where I am. For once, let him be the one freaking out about what I'm doing with all of my spare time. Who fucking cares what he thinks?

I deserve to be happy. I am not a puppet. I am on no one's strings. And this is my fucking life. He has no jurisdiction on these parts

I deserve better

This letter is a bit long but I hope someone will read it. It is a bit scattered

**Short Backstory**

My girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago because she is very stressed over her busy life and doesn't feel like it's fair to either of us that she has very little time or metal capacity right now to devote to us. She has said she might be able to give us a chance in the future but right now she has fallen out of love with me because of where she is personally. We have been talking a bit

**Letter**

Dearest

I feel the days have grown worse. I miss you more than anything in the world and I never knew I was capable of this type of pain. I've told the story a hundred times to anyone who will listen in the few short days since you walked away and every time it breaks my heart. I have never had feelings for any person the way I have for you. I was sure that one day

I still can't be in my apartment where you used to sleep so comfortably with me tucked in each other's arms or where I would cook us dinner to share

I can't sleep without you and wonder where you might be or what you might be up to. The thoughts in my mind of what went wrong have haunted me so much that I feel like I may collapse from exhaustion. We used to talk every day and comfort each other when things were challenging and my closest friend in the world isn't here to console me in all of this pain. I don't know where to turn.

I wish I knew how you are doing and what is going on in your mind

Please know that I miss you and I love you more than anything.",,t5_2ra79,1350771708.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11tej2/to_the_woman_who_broke_my_heart_the_letter_i_will/

I wished I was able to utter the words in my heart. But because I didn't I will use this to help me find the words I couldnt say to him:

I love you to my core. I love you so much that walking away felt like my legs were stuck in quick sand. I loved you the minute I opened the door of the pre-war apartment and I found you standing there in your gray peacoat and smile. My heart and soul fluttered as I began planning our life together. I was so excited to cook for you and to play house. I just wanted to build a family with you. We both wanted more than what we had. We wanted a better life, i felt reborn. My past mistakes cleansed, my future pure as gold. 
I never expected you to hold my mistakes over my head
I never expected you, leaving my bare body exposed to the world. 
How can i trust you? How can I trust my life in your hands? How can you say such harsh words? As if this we're in an adolescent relationship that flickers on and off depending on the time of day. How can a man utter the cruel words that butchers his wife's soul and excuse it as moments of ""anger""? 
A man should always hold his wife to the highest esteem

You sit there and play victim. Say I never loved you. Never respected you. And I let out a soft cry of disappointment and shame. I never called you names. I always defended you. The only thing i was guilty of was wanting to share my life with you and only you. the people around us are nothing but negative and I just wanted to be formal with them. 
At the end of the day
I still sleep in your Pjs. I still wish I was holding you every night when I go to bed. 

Never has anyone in my life ever viewed me in the skewed way you view me. In such a negative light the way you do. Is it easier for you to feel like youre better than me? does it make you feel more of a man putting me down and creating this illusion of a neighborhood alcoholic money hungry whore? When in reality

I wished you could see how horrible you were. How you broke me to the point of silence. I hope one day you will wake up and understand why you gave me no choice but to walk away

My bad.  I deleted the old one.

First time Reddit post, and student teaching this semester and I'll graduate in December, to give you some context to my life. This past Friday, my 22 year old girlfriend (graduated last May, just started teaching 7th grade in August) dumped me. We had been dating just over two years. We met in college and it's the greatest relationship I've ever been in. But since she started working in August we've been 2 hours apart and only saw each other every 2 weeks (first year/student teaching is overwhelming!).

I didn't see the break-up coming because the weekend prior we had a great time, because I was thinking about my life after graduation. It wasn't a good place, I know, but it was just on my mind and I blurted it out. We had discussed it before, and she seemed okay with the idea then. And I didn't make it an ultimatum situation; I may or may not be able to get a job near her when I graduate, so it would only happen if the cards fell right. I also, in a dense ""guy move"", which I know is strange, even though we talked about it before
So I was a little bothered by her reaction

The next week happened, and she received a mug in the mail with my school photo on it and an ""AMERICA, FUCK YEAH"" style background as a joke and it cracked her up, as I hoped. Little did I know that mug would become the most awkward gift I've ever given.

She came to the wedding, kissed, joked together. She kept a straight face and cool composition as my grandpa and dad and uncle all complimented her and said we were a great couple and told her how much they liked her. I figured everything was okay based on her calm reactions. She took the day off friday and stayed at my place. I went to school and she brought me lunch, we ate together, nothing seemed off. I even told her how excited I was to come home to her (something I'm not used to this fall), and she agreed.

Then I get home and change and lounge in bed with her and I'm peachy-keen. Then she gets this sad face

Sorry this is so long, and that if we were to move in, she'd want to feel that way first, even if we didn't *end up* married or living together forever. She said she wanted to be honest and that she owed it to me to tell me the truth. She didn't want to lead me on if we didn't feel the same way or on the same level. That much, I understand. But there was no real reason, there wasn't much for me to object to. It was more of a blurry explanation from her, and not a conversation that I had any say in. When I tried to equate her feeling with something I overlooked or did, ""You didn't do anything wrong."" But it just ended up confusing me so much more.

She said I was the ""perfect boyfriend;"" I understood her weird humor, I helped her appreciate herself and feel beautiful, her family likes me (her great aunt LOVES me). She said that I'm so sweet and that I'd be great dad and husband material (even though we are both comfortable not talking about marriage or kids yet), but some invisible un-explainable thing was not clicking with her even though seemingly everything else was. She said it wasn't about being single, or being with someone else, which I've wondered about, because I was her first ""full-on"" sex partner. But I trust that's not what it's about. I asked if it was because of the distance, and if we're best friends and understand each other and can be totally ourselves with each other (and, and she acknowledged that she might be making the ""biggest mistake in her life."" And if she does, but I can't put her on a pedestal.

For the record

But most of all I'm frustrated because I'm supposedly the greatest, never slacked. It was very healthy, too, no cheating or abuse of any kind between the both of us; we were always very open and honest. I never felt taken advantage of either, but she definitely kept her defenses up more than I did. I thought we were really happy, I thought we were super compatible. But my best isn't enough for her. There's some magic thing that's not there, and I guess maybe that's all that matters?

Is there anyone who has gone through this already and has had enough time to process it to explain it to me? Ladies, do you buy into the ""I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore"" thing without big problems in the relationship to dismantle the love? (Emphasis on ""anymore,"" considering I know this excuse is given by a lot by people, seemly mostly women, for why relationships don't get off the ground. But this was a solid 2 years and a few months before I got read this line.) Well, I guess gender doesn't matter, or if you are in a same-sex relationship.

I'm sorry for such a wall of text and I don't know what the Reddit protocol is. I tried to space everything out and be pretty organized, inexpensive things at home alone, or crying when someone sends me a supportive message via facebook or text. I've been trying not to cry in public places when I start to think about not seeing her again. Clearly, I need some friggin' help. Thanks in advance for any help or support you give.

P.S. This is gonna be kind of a jerk, especially since we didn't see each other as often. Teaching dominated her life (and still does) so she doesn't take very good care of herself sometimes, and that includes taking medicine/pills when she needs to. And I've heard that women can change their tune about a relationship based on those hormonal changes (either going on or off the pill). Could this play into it and it's partly that she's not attracted to me or lost the ""in love"" feelings anymore due to changed hormones? Or am I trying to explain this away with a selfish ""girl problems"" style scientific explanation?

**TL;DR: I (23/M) got dumped by my girlfriend (22/F) after 2+ years of dating. She re-evaluated some things after I asked about moving in hypothetically (a convo we've already had, or is this lack of feeling a legitimate thing? How can I be perfect, yet not enough?

I have so much anger inside of me that I am scared of myself. At times, wonderful person you used to be is just on hiatus. Maybe he will come back someday? It will be far too late for us


Beyond my anger


Buried deep behind my anger and my fear is an intense sadness that does not go away, and I think that’s why I try to comfort myself by saying you’re on hiatus; I don’t want to have to deal with the thought that you’re gone forever.


I still feel a dead weight on my left ring finger where you made your promises. I remember how hard it was to leave that ring outside your house when I found out that you were willing to break every single wonderful promise you had ever made me. You’re off now calling some other girl perfect, or if you’re just trying to convince yourself that you are because that’s the easy way out. I wonder a lot of things about you because everything that you have done for the last five weeks has been completely uncharacteristic and frankly quite alarming.


For three years, but something inside of you has changed. You have turned cold. The compassion and care that I always admired you for (something I felt that I lacked) is gone. We spent three years loving each other, and you have spent the last few weeks calling me insane, tearing me down, and making me hate myself more than I already do. You have already taken away every ounce of happiness in my life. As I try to rebuild without you, you adamantly try to crush my foundation because I fought for what was right. Does some part of you know that I was right? Will you realize it years down the road? I don’t know.


I wonder often what will happen if we don’t speak for years and then we just bump into each other somewhere. What will we say to each other? Will we say anything? Perhaps we will be cowards and pretend not to see each other. Perhaps we will look each other dead in the eye and keep walking. Perhaps we will reconnect. Or perhaps we will never see each other again


I don’t know if you’ll ever read this. This isn’t like the last letter. I’m not going to go leave it at your house. I am going to send it out into the universe. Maybe you’ll read it, but there are countless ways that I am still holding on. Why am I holding on to nothing? Why am I holding on to something I genuinely do not want? I am not being untrue when I say that I don’t want you.  I don’t want to be with you. I want to be back where we were a few weeks ago, but that time has come and gone. You have made your decisions, and you have forced me to make mine. I have had to deal with my entire life shifting. My entire focus has had to shift because I had made you my focus. I can’t decide if that was a mistake or not. It is certainly why I am so hurt, but it made me so happy at the time. Hindsight is an interesting thing.


I will never say that I deserve better. I know that underneath the horrible choices you’re making now, no matter how much time goes by. I don’t know if such a person exists. I don’t know if I will ever find him. If I do, though, I will truly be able to be glad that things ended with you, and that kind of closure will feel amazing.


My solution to dealing with our breakup is different than yours, and I want to believe in love, even if I can’t have it right now. I will believe in love, no matter what happens to me.


I am sure that I met you for a reason, if nothing else. I think it had to have been more than that, though. I think that I will figure out in my life why I met you, and I think it was for more than experience. It has been one week since I talked to you. It has been five weeks since you deserted me. For the first four weeks, I struggled not to text you or call you every second of every day. This week, though, has been easy. I have found that I don’t like who you have become or who you’re pretending to be, and I am not interested in being berated. 


I will never back down from my knowledge that I have been right this entire time. You made the wrong decision, and you will grow, and someday, you will regret. You may not think so now, but you will. Give it a few years. Give it a few heartbreaks. Once you feel what I’ve been feeling for five weeks, you will regret the way that you have treated me.


I want to remind you that I didn’t deserve this. I was not perfect, but I am still not whole. I still cry. I still have panic attacks. I still miss everything about us, even though I don’t want you back because I don’t think “us” would be the same when you are not.


Goodbye. Goodbye to the first time I met you, and goodbye to you.

Before we broke up, and it hurt a lot. He was a friend and a lover and I thought so highly of him. He obviously didn't think the same of me. And on top of that, he burned our friendship to the ground over a misunderstanding (apparently, returning his request of ""let's be friends"" meant to him ""hey, I want to be the only woman in your life"") and that hurt the most. In fact, that's what I was so hung up on. Maybe he was angry or upset and didn't mean what he said, but who knows? I don't.

But why should I get hung up on that? Beating myself up over thinking I wasn't good enough won't do any good. It just didn't work. There was nothing I could do to make things work. It's sad, wouldn't it be great if I could be with someone who is great *and* loves me very much? That would be wonderful. I'm worthy of having nice things, so why try to settle on someone who wouldn't give me what I wanted in a relationship?

I know I'm a good person. I definitely know that. Nothing has changed since that day. I woke up the same person that I always was and goddammit, but that's not a primary concern right now and there's nothing I can do about that, either. What I *can* do is continue being the person I am and move forward with my own life.

* Look at ALL you learned; I have no doubt in my mind that you are a STRONGER person now. I know that you would never let anyone pull some of the stuff on you that you let yourself tolerate before. Your next relationship will be **healthier because you won't let it be otherwise**
* YOU are worthwhile; think about all of the work you're doing to heal yourself! You are working every day to put yourself back on your feet and start being happy again! You have started to do things differently

I'm in the pits today. I ran a big race yesterday and today my body is weak, etc. and I am in the pits. Looking to find something positive is not easy, but I know that I shouldn't focus on that day that I will feel happy again at the expense of comparing it to today because that is not going to make me happy. I *should* look at where I am, how far I've come, and *know* that this attitude is healthy.

1334437870.0,s9y4n,3 year span with a text book sociopath.. now what?,brokenboomerang,18,5,14,"Right now, he accused me of cheating on him with my neighbor (so very no!) and dumped me. A few weeks later we talked and worked it out, and now I'm pretty sure she never told him any such thing) And it was off again. 

Every few months he'd coming running back to me, and every time I somehow thought I had something to prove and I was the most brilliant psudo-girlfriend that anyone could ever be. I was utterly devoted to him and his happiness each time and just so grateful that he was back.

6 months ago he came to me again and I could finally tell him I thought I was over him and we should be friends and stay in eachother's lives. He had a girlfriend, his regret at ever leaving me, telling me he didn't love his girlfriend, saying she used him and made him feel miserable and he had put up with it. If only he had put a fraction of that much effort into our relationship, we'd still happily be together. He said I had never gotten out of his head, that he saw a future with me and couldn't stand the thought that after all this, we wouldn't end up together. He admitted his roommates only ever hated me because he told them lies about me

We texted all day, and everything seemed better than ever. It was enough to convince me it was real.

For months we didn't do anything- he was in a relationship, and reinforced all the time how much he loved me, planning out this picture perfect future with me. I decided this time I would fight for it, because I was in love, and it was the most real thing I'd ever felt, and he felt the same, and it just had to end with us together.

Eventually I broke down and slept with him. Obviously, and I told him so every day. But he told me to just stay, not move on, just wait and we'd have it all. I let myself be convinced it would all be worth it, so I shoved it down ans suffered with my guilt and rollercoaster of emotions. The one time a couple of months ago that I had meekly if he still said these lovey dovey things to his gf (afterall, they had now been together over a year), he got mad. Like, so I went and got him a new job at my friend's office. At this point

This is when he told me he never had any intention of leaving his girlfriend. He was going to take the job for 3 weeks, but after days of me trying to get answers, turns out he knew going in that this could never be more than a game. It never was anything but. I couldn't believe it because who could commit all that time every day to someone they didn't have feelings for? 

But it eventually came out that he just saw me as a toy. His old toy (the gf) was getting boring, just stupid little things, he'd always lie about for the sake of knowing he could get away with it. 

He didn't feel bad about hurting me, the anger at being questioned, the knowing exactly what to say to make someone believe what you want, the promiscuity, the control issues.. He seems like a text book sociopath, and I was actually frightened of him.

I told him to stay out of my life from now on. I know I'm glad he's gone. I know it was all lies

Today I am allowing myself to acknowledge that it was real

Today I am allowing myself to acknowledge that it doesn't go away even though I am moving on.

Today I am allowing myself to postpone my planned self-care and to continue to shirk social obligations in favor of this inevitably regular flood of grief.

Good grief

I understand that it is good, and instead with ignorance.

Ignorance is for sitting at my desk at work realizing I have an easier time appreciating each marked off task, and do not need to, remind myself to project ignorance.

Ignorance is for shutting down my emotions when grief starts to wake up again and for taking a day each weekend to mope and be despondent

Ignorance is not for the few chocked sobs that escape as I walk through the mostly empty courtyard a block away from the front door.

Ignorance is not for detouring the front door to avoid the doorman on the rare days my eyes do not clear up as I pass the last of the Christmas animal decorations.

Today I am being present and aware before I leave the apartment. I will feel everything as intensely as they really are (at the level I try to ignore the rest of the time) and I will embrace the moments when intensity feels like it could be too much for me.

Today I am letting my grief out of its box of blissful ignorance in order to let its rawness wash over me

There was a lot of friction between us (it still is) because I recommended him to be  hired in the IT company I have been working for the past 6 years. Needless to say that I have to work with him &amp; see his face daily and everybody at work knows about this. He has promised to leave this place but in vain

OK, he hasn't called not even once, not even to say 'happy new year' 

I still have some remaining feelings for him

In one day I feel like I hate him and I don't want to see his face anymore because he treated me so poorly (I feel used &amp; abused as he's been lieing about his feelings and told me he loved me although he didn't ... and I gave my all to him, helped him go to university and loved him with all my heart... ) And then I start being super mean to him, at work and in personal messages just because I see him and I remember myself how much damage he has caused me. I am physically sick, I've lost about 6kg and I still have little to no appetite for food, and when I told this to him, he told me it's my choice to not eat. (WTF?)

I'm around 25 years old and I went through my first breakup. It was soul crushing. I'm usually a very cheery and controlled person and so when it happened it hit me like a truck. I knew it was bad when my mom asked me ""are you all right?"" and I said ""no."" She was crushed, my thoughts would immediately rush to the situation I was in. I would helplessly lay there and feel my body go into stress mode (heaviness in the chest, something caught in my throat, and adrenaline rushing). Sometimes it would take hours before I could sleep again. At work I would sit in meetings feeling the heartache, even when my thoughts weren't necessarily focused on her. I was so afraid of being alone, I would constantly IM everyone and call people, because of the fear of the sadness that would rush in the moment I had time to myself. As CS Lewis once wrote: ""Part of every misery is... the misery's shadow: The fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief

I had to go to a wedding during my recovery time and it was really hard. I expected it to be hard to watch the couple in love interact with each other, every couple is extra romantic. And it didn't help that the songs that she and I used to sing kept playing at the reception. 

During this time I just couldn't get myself past her. I kept thinking that somehow there wouldn't be anyone as perfect. Anyone as charming and beautiful. As funny and engaging. I kept feeling like somehow I just missed out on the best person ever

But then... time passed and the feelings started to seem... farther. The thoughts were just as frequent, they stopped being accompanied by the heavy ache. Before, when I saw other couples it made me sad, but as time went on, I started looking at my friends' wives (not creepy) and realizing that they were pretty awesome too. In specific ways they were even more awesome than the girl that broke my heart. That perspective helped me be more objective about the whole thing. Yes this girl is awesome, but you know, she wasn't perfect. But for whatever reason, in some ways, make sure not to become bitter. They haven't disappointed you

This morning I woke up at 5:30, I was able to go back to sleep immediately, without rolling around in pain. I am sure that in the future, on occasion, it will still come back and hit me. But, I can see it getting better. And it feels awesome to remember the things that used to bring me joy. Being able to live outside of the constant shadow of grief. 

I know that things might seem bleak. That you might be in more pain than you have ever been in your whole life. You may be grieving to the point that it feels like fear. Even the things that you used to enjoy

* No contact.
* Go hang out with people. It really helps. Find friends that you can spend time with just to keep the loneliness at bay. If it's a close friend
* Don't be afraid of the sleepless nights and the pain. Things started changing for me once I started being ok with those things. Yea I am going to physically hurt throughout the whole day, eventually it will have diminishing returns, and your body will learn to not freak out at it. 
* Journal! This helped me a lot. Specially if you have a racing mind. Sometimes just having your thoughts written down helps to take your mind off of it. It's like when you write an appointment in your calendar
* On the other hand, make an effort not to talk about it or think about it. When the thoughts come rushing in, just force yourself to think about something else.

I have to thank all of you for this community. Just knowing that I wasn't alone really helped me. I feel like I'm on my way across the bridge. For those of you guys that feel like you're still super far from the bridge... you'll get here on your time. See you on the other side.

We met in college (I'm 29 male, until the relationship ended by her choice, because of a multitude of ""reasons.""  Careers after school, masters programs, religion, seeming to not have the same interests anymore, etc.  Basically

This didn't matter to me, I decided I needed to try to move on (yes, we were still intimate whenever we met).  So I told her that I could no longer have any more contact with her.  Because even imagining her getting close to someone besides me drove me insane and I knew (as much as it hurt) that she no longer wanted to be with me at this point.  

I wanted to see her one more time before we said our goodbyes

Fast forward about 5-6 years to present day:
After countless ""relationships"" and flings on my part, everything I had worked on for the last few years just broke apart.  And I knew immediately, that I still loved her.  Loved her so god damned much.  Dinner ends and we parted ways.  But now, a few days later, I'm sitting her reeling back into the alcoholism I had to combat after our breakup.

I am 21 years old, a 1.5 hour flight apart, but had seen each other at regular intervals. We also emailed and talked on Skype daily.


He found out several hours ago that his mother is ill (possibly terminally ill). He loves his mother. He is a responsible and kind individual. His sister is mentally ill. His mother takes care of her. His father is growing old and is busy with work and his brother is irresponsible and would not be able to properly take care of his sister. This means that task would fall to him.


We had a conversation about his mother's health and the future of our relationship. He said he couldn't be with me anymore because our relationship is no longer practical. I am still in school and plan to do my Masters where I am now. He will be busy with his family and could not leave them. Due to circumstances with the well-being of my own family members


I understand this. Really


However, my boyfriend was emotionally abusive, pressured me into doing certain things and was, in retrospect, a jerk. I was very sad when we broke up but I kept reminding myself, it's okay. He wasn't right for you. I felt like I deserved the way he treated me, yet hoped I would find someone who truly loved me.


When I met A, and listened to what I had to say. I tried my best to do the same for him. Whenever something made me happy, he was the first one I wanted to tell. I could spend nine hours talking with A about anything, and still have more to say.


I fell deeply in love. I had a lot of probably naive thoughts. I believed I would marry him someday. I thought about how many people would be at our wedding. I imagined having a family with him. He thought the same things about me. I thought things like


Life isn't fair. It sucks. I feared I didn't deserve him and it looks like I didn't. I am young, and I want to be there for him while he has to deal with this.


He is still my closest friend. I realize that one day he will find someone else. Someone who lives closer that can make him happy. He will probably stop going online then. Maybe I will have found someone else too. But I'm a selfish person. I love him and want to be the one he loves back. I don't want to find someone else


But life doesn't work that way. I have to suck it up and be there for him. And despite my wishes, anyway?


It feels nearly impossible to go on right now. He was what drove me to want to do better, more than he knows. But I need to stop being self-absorbed and just be his friend right now, and listen to his worries and fears. I have to stop thinking about myself no matter how I'm feeling, because what he is dealing with is worse.

1. You have always succeeded in making me jealous. You used to have control over how I felt. Not anymore. I decide how I feel. 

2. Part of me wanted a guy to compete with you and your new girl. I no longer feel like I need one. I will learn a lot on my own. You can't force a good connection or create the perfect circumstances to meet someone. It will happen when it happens. 

3. You are hurt just like I am. How we deal with it determines how we'll each heal. (Read: I'm facing my emotions and he's distracting himself with another girl) 

4. I imagined a summer fling when I thought of us breaking up. I may  not actually be ready this summer. Or maybe I will be

5. I committed to the pain this breakup would bring when I decided to deserve better. I will do what it takes to get there.

Ive done all the usual things like remove her from facebook, but will wait for a month for things to settle a bit, or ill communicate through a neutral friend.

Over the week
Yesterday my friend cooked me up some food

I have done breakups before, im in another country (that I love), and although it was refreshing to have an amicable breakup (ive had a few drama breakups in my past), it also leaves you not having good reasons to hate them/know its over.

I would like to think that theres enough advice on the net/this sub for advice on getting over a girl.  Like I said

Here are some issues I am trying to work through:

* I work in technology

* The house.  For the first few days I was still expecting to see her around the house

1) Stay here and get someone else to move in. 

2) Move out to a smaller place and live alone.

3) Move out to someone elses houseshare.

4) Move out to a place and rent a room to someone.

Im leaning towards #4 and I am not rushing into it, but dont want to turn into a hermit.  I kind of thought that I was too old for dealing with houseshares now, but then the company could be good (depending on the company I guess).

* The cat.  This must be a common one.  We both love the cat.  He is an outdoor cat.  For me, so cat would have to be then passed to someone else. Also, I earn more and have the option to choose a house that has a garden and roomates that dont have dogs/etc. 

* Meeting new people.  Most of my friends are settled down, I dont like the fact that his girlfriends sitting at home on her own or im around there being a gooseberry.  Just feels a bit awkard.  I guess I need to start looking at some things to get into to meet some new people.  I am ashamed to say that i have spent a fair bit of time on OkCupid the last couple of days.  Mainly just to try and see whos out there and get into talking to talking to female strangers again.  Its actually been quite nice and although I would not even think about dating anyone for a good couple of months, it seems to be a good distraction for when im thinking about the X.  Any thoughts on this?

Thats enough words from me.  Quite helpful for me just pouring that out.  Let me know if you have any advice for me and thanks in advance.  Theres been some good reads on this sub that help,False,,t5_2ra79,1371171395.0,,,t3_1gb272

I was doing no contact for a while

Backstory - We dated for a year and 4 months. It was fantastic until the last two. We talked about the future, and there are cultural implications involved in dating outside of the race. Things like kids have to have a certain percentage of native heritage to be considered for tribal inclusion, the two of us couldn't live on her home reservation, as my heritage prevents, it, etc... But we discussed those and determined that we'd cross that bridge when we came to it. We were happy and loved each other. She works in Native American health care, and was increasingly becoming more culturally connected to the native community (we live in a big city

During the last two months of our relationship, but she assured me they were only friends. Eventually, because of her relationship with this new guy, I told her she needed to take a step back and evaluate our relationship and whether the cultural differences were insurmountable. And that if they weren't, I was ready and willing to continue our relationship. 

After a week, there was definitely emotional. I was livid at first. Reacted with the standard ""I knew it! You betrayed me!"" type of stuff. And after a pathetic week of bargaining and pleading, I began NC. It lasted about a month, until she reached out. During that month I did a lot of thinking. Objective thinking. Removing me from the equation and really thinking about what happened. 

She fell for this guy. It started happening while we were dating, ""Full speed ahead"", and your brain is saying, ""I can't stop this thing even if I wanted to. I don't even know where the brakes are!"" I know this feeling. I felt it for her when we first started dating. It sucks that it happened on my watch, but it happened for her. She handled the situation poorly, and during that month and a half of the texting she should have said to me, ""We need to talk"". But overall she's a great person that handled a situation poorly. When we split up, and that's why she never wanted to talk to me about it. Like I said

Yesterdays meeting was nice. We talked about what was going on in each others' lives, but I explained my epiphany. The two of them are in love. She admits it's moving quickly, but there's nothing she can do about it. Her heart is steering the ship. They've talked about moving together to another state with a stronger native american cultural base. They've talked about marriage, although she says it's definitely way far off. I mean, they're in love. And I'm legitimately happy for her. I don't know if this is a strange way to think, but if our relationship ended because of this guy, I'd rather that this guy be the one that she ends up with. Has kids with. At least our relationship wouldn't have ended in vain because of some dick she met in a bar. I mean, but this seems different for her. And I'm happy for her. 

I think we'll probably continue to talk. Obviously she has a lot of other things on her plate right now, but do what you think is right for you. And really think about the breakup if you're able. It can totally help your brain.

 Now I have given advice, you probably always will but you have to figure out how to move on now. Here's where I have come to so far and what I suggest you remember.

Now, or so I thought we both were giving it all we had, I was ruined by her and really hurt beyond explanation, still am, always will feel disappointed in her really and always, always will have a strong love for her. 

However in the time that's past since, I didn't sulk, no, I didn't cry; I just was me, I was real and it works. You'll always feel love for the ex that hurt you, you will likely always want them back; but you can't dwell on it forever. It's their lose really and you can only keep moving forward.

Look, I acted myself. I didn't go home with any woman, I didn't get any numbers. No, that's not me, I am; first off not ready; and secondly; madly in love with the woman I always dreamed of who, yes, hurt me like no one else. So while that part of me didn't change what changed is that I actually got more confident, found out I am far more of a catch than I kept thinking I am and you all should too. Remember you're better than your ex in that regard

It turns out, not only physically but mentally. Awesome! I am a hot guy or at least an attractive enough guy in the sense that good looking and decent woman want me for who I am, enough that I feel guilty even though I was the one dumped, wow; kinda cool really. You all are attractive woman/guys my fellow dumpees; don't hide it, show it, be yourself, be confident and get out there and live your life. 

If our ex's want us back, let them come back and you can decide if they are worthy to be back in your life or not. 

For me, I'll find true love if this EX of mine can't see it as clearly as I; and you know what...that's her lose and her regret to live with, not mine. She is aware of the kinship, love, trust and bond that she decided to drop between us. I have that in me and I have that confidence and passion which I fully understand, so buck up and remember this line I am paraphrasing; ""You get busy dying or you get busy living!"".

The pain is visceral and it's sickening and I can't escape it.

I haven't seen him in almost one year. He rightly cut me out of his life.

I was insecure and cheated on him and withheld the truth because I was so scared to lose him. He took longer than me to fall in love and I was mistrusting. By the time I realised how deeply I loved him I had already broken us. The irony that my selfish need to be loved meant I lost the man I loved above everything

I don't deserve sympathy and I don't deserve forgiveness; I was pathetic and unthinking and not the person I hope to be today.

For all those who have been cheated on; I am so sorry. I don't know what the circumstances were in your relationship but betrayal is almost too painful to bear in love.

So a year on and it still hurts. I can point to it in my stomach. There are days when I forget and am happy. Then there are bad days and I feel like I will carry this pain around forever and it is just too much. I starve myself to try and feel absolved and show the world how sorry I am but it's just isolated me more.

I don't think that ""once a cheat

She and I were madly in love, big plans to move to a new city, new state, and begin to build our lives together, we were together for 2 years. But then things got stale, and we both had our doubts, and a slightly unhealthy attachment to each other emotionally. Because of this we decided that the best thing to do would be if we decided to call it quits. We haven't completely cut off contact, but we just weren't right for each other

Back to my initial point. Social networking has made this process more difficult than it should be. I find myself checking her FB, not now, because I liken it to deleting memories, but the problem I have is that they were GOOD memories, memories that I want to hold onto. They were painfully wonderful memories that we made together over the past two years, and I'm just not ready to let go of them. 

She called me the other night, because a girl who I am friends with liked a photo on my instagram. I am not seeing this girl or anything, but I know she saw it. I have since set everything on there to private, and we no longer follow each other on that particular site. She just kept saying ""Why? Why does this hurt so bad? Why did we do this to each other?"" And I couldn't answer those questions. I still love her, and I know its time to move on. 

I'm trying to pick up the pieces and remind myself that this was mutual and for the best. Nobody said it would be easy, I can't do that to her, I can't do that to myself. I still love her and wish her all the best in her life, and I hope she finds herself out there. I can only hope she wants the same for me.

'Hold my hand' you said

I could feel the pattern of the ground shifting and your dress clinging against my thighs. The sound of our movement turned clattery as we strolled through what was a mystery to my senses. Could it be a shore of pebbles? Perhaps those are twigs in a forest? Or the rough road to a village?

You giggled naughtily as I remained puzzled. The only image I had in my mind was of you

Happiness, the present, the future - they fell short of this timeless experience. The only thing that mattered was my love to you. For what is a world without love?

My legs were heavy. Our lazy walk turned to a stride uphill. I felt compelled to reason. And yet you remained censored on telling our whereabouts. 'Only a mile ahead' you said. It felt weird to trip endlessly in the darkness

We stalled for a moment. You loosed my hold and patted me on the cheek. I could hear my bristles whistling against your arms. Nothing understood me better than your touch. Synergy is chaos compared to how your fingers caressed my hair.

'Kiss me.' Your voice reverberated flirtatiously in the corridors of my heart. My nerves adjusted themselves to your clutch. And when you kissed me

Harmonious we were. I felt possessed - not by a demon - but a Venusian angel. I felt like a child who munched on a lollipop for the first time. I felt like a stray dog finding a home

As you let go

You retook my hand and resumed our journey. Each and every one of my heartbeats was synchronized to match your grip. It wasn't a day-dream. I was there. You were there. And even though I didn't know where we were. I followed - believing your path.

Then, nevertheless, imbued with terror.

'So I've found a way to eternalize it' you added. While still holding my hand, I couldn't follow - I didn't believe your path.

I couldn't fathom what I had witnessed. Your eyes gazed mine in reconciliation, your felicity contrasted my horror. And with a light thud, you crashed upon the terrain, erecting a pool of blood. I let out a mighty howl.

It felt like a dagger stabbing me in the chest. In slow motion, encircled by fire. I felt what you didn't feel - as you didn't feel anything.

I was watching you

I wanted to follow suit. Perhaps you were right - only an inch away was the answer. And our amorousness be restored. I closed my eyes again, the world and everyone else. I grinned sarcastically.

And then it occurred to me that I love my life. I love my friends. I love my family. I love my society and culture. I love nature and I love freedom. I love reason and cause. I also love myself.

heres is TLDR backstory: im 29m who dated a 27f for 6 months or so. I was in love with her more than i have ever loved anyone else.. things weren't working and i broke up with her despite the fact i am in total love with her.. i actually ended up finding out she cheated and now has a new bf.

the good news is… im still alive and my heart is still beating. its been 8+ months since ive seen her.. i think of her every day and i still miss her. but something has come over me. i realized there is more to life then girls and relationships. just go fucking live your life man. be awesome. be the best you

- one way to be amazing is find inspiration through other sources… actors, dad, uncle, comics.. Anything that is positive. Emulate someone successful!

- go to the gym. it releases endorphins.. it also helps your libido. trust me on this one. Rome wasn't built in one day. no one cares if you have a six pack or whatever.. just go to the gym and you will instantly feel better about yourself.. remember

- hang out with friends and have guy nights.. i recommend the weekends because there will be more girls out.

- READ or listen to anything by Neil Strauss. He wrote ""The Game"".. It will seriously change your fucking life. you will immediately stop feeling sorry for yourself and want to change your behaviors once you have finished watching this dvd.  listen to it at work or wherever

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGTX-hz5YRA

- Read about other pick up artists.. most of these guys were down and out losers with women but have changed their lives and social status by modifying their philosophy and way of thinking. 

- Get a buddy who is willing to be a fellow wingman.




TLDR: i used to want to kill myself… i would only find pleasure in thinking of creative ways to die. I miss my ex, he has shown me about being a pickup artist.. my buddy isn't the best looking guy but he doesn't give a fuck. he is flowing with confidence. so now, instead of worrying about my ex, im more worried about how many girls i can meet in a week. i don't want to die anymore.. hell, i just realized how awesome i have become and texted my ex gf with some small chat.. she has a bf and whatever, but i have now taken her off the pedestal. who cares if i end up with her again.. i just want her to see how amazing i am and that im able to move on from her. 

Well guys

And I've had my downs

I think I'm doing surprisingly well now, it's exactly what I needed.

I started working out again, so the running and hiking is really kicking my ass, but damn does it feel good.

I started making a schedule for myself: Monday: Go for a run, create story ark for picture book, go out?; Wednesday: Game night, Run?... etc. Scheduling things has really helped me stay focused and kept me from coming home and just sitting on the couch, a habit I'm working on breaking. The more I do all this stuff, the less I feel like sitting on the couch all night vegging out (one of the things I did that contributed to killing the relationship).

I ordered a huge map of the world. Why? Because I have always wanted to travel and I've always found reasons not to, approximately when, and how badly I want to go there (another reason things fell apart: I wasn't pursuing my own dreams and was using her to make me happy).

I've picked up Rosetta Stone and am going to learn three new languages. First on the list is Brazillian Portuguese, a language from Asia (not sure which, maybe Mandarin?), Last, a European Language (German?). I feel like this should really help me exercise my mind and get me thinking about other cultures in ways I've so far not. I'm actually incredibly excited about this.

I played this game the other day, or open up a new doc, or just say it aloud. Start with the sentence, ""I like BlastedToMoosh (your name instead of mine), I really do,"" and then list all the things about yourself you like. The only rules are you can't include caveats like, ""I like BlastedToMoosh because he's pretty hot,"" and no negatives. I really recommend saying it aloud when you're alone

I [21M] just got cheated on by my [24F] girlfriend to end a 3-year relationship. Found out 3 days ago. It was my first love, lie, and hurt each other. For the most part, in our relationship, we communicated well, we supported each other, and we were in love. But we had difficulties too. In the end, and she started growing distant. Then, and I promised myself then that if she ever broke my trust again

The pros and cons:
If she hadn't cheated, and hopefully I'll find someone that is more compatible down the road.

The con is that I feel betrayed. I've known her for so long, and they were in the way of us having a happy relationship. For the shittiness of the situation, though, we ended on good terms. We both know this is what's best. We both still care about each other, I just can't ever trust her again. Maybe someday we'll be friends.

I'm happy that I'm not having any doubts. I hope it'll get me through the grieving process faster. Have any of you been cheated on to end a relationship? What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of that being the end?

Needless to say the breakup was shit and it effected us both emotionally

Anyway, and felt extremely lonely on a regular basis since all of my close friends now work around the country. I'd see one of them once a week if I was lucky.
Meanwhile, and exciting. She seemed happy so quickly and it was this apparent disparity in how we felt that killed me. She even sent me a text at one point saying she didn't miss me anymore. This hurt. Alot. Mainly because I just couldn't bring myself to get on without her. My best friend for nearly 4 years. Immediately after the breakup she had put in alot of effort to extend her circles and meet new people (mainly guys, to my horror), something I was too stubborn to do in the midst of exams. She was even openly flirting with an 'old friend' off of her course. This is something I lost my cool over a few times and confronted her on.

In this time I sort of went on a rollercoaster ride swinging between indifference/apathy towards her and her life and just being downright distraught at times. I tried the usual stuff; got in shape, though I clearly wasn't ready!
But, at first, the relief I desperately needed to displace my loneliness and turmoil. But more and more I started to feel like all of it was useless since not one of them fit the bill to be my ex's successor (at this point I'd found out she was sleeping with, and 'pursuing a relationship' with the guy mentioned earlier. So going back was now out of the question. At least for the time being.) It all just felt futile. And I started to lose interest again in dating...

So jump to now. A few weeks ago I moved back to university
Then the stupid thing happens and we get really drunk and we kiss. I ended up sleeping in her bed (nothing more than kissing happened

Which brings me to my realisation...

It dawned on me in the days following that night that the reason i had suffered so much during the breakup is because I was trying to find a like for like replacement for my ex. Another basket for all my eggs. A substitute. And then, something we used to do. The guy off her course, he replaced our intimacy and close friendship. The people she lived with and work, replaced the fact that we used to live together and be almost always close, always chatting. Always together. So she had constant momentary distractions.

Now I'm looking to spread all the things i loved about her and find them where I can in new people and friends

And then....the ex, the dark days far outnumber the good days.

When 'we' started

Eleven years later she swapped me for a co-worker. Destroying my world, my dreams and a whole lot more. Near the end the relationship went sour. I didn't understand what was happening, but the moment she started to develop feelings for he co-worker (with wife, kid and house...), I became more and more of an evil thing in her eyes. She started to resent me and I couldn't do a damn thing about it. Some futile attempts of mine were met with complete lack of enthusiasm. She left me in the dark for months. When her co-worker acknowledge the same feelings, she dumped me the next day. Saying: ""I don't feel it anymore"".

* She was honesty herself.
* Our love would last forever and survive anything.
* She would be the last person on earth to cheat on me..

After over 7 years together my girlfriend suddenly developed feelings for her personal trainer

Our relationship was a lot of firsts for the both of us, my first kiss (and for me the only person I have kissed). We both thought we were going to get married and have kids and grow old together, nothing made me happier than the thought of sharing the rest of my life with this person. Well you all understand what I mean so I will get into the nitty gritty of it.

We had been living together for the last 3.5 years. About 8 weeks ago she decides that we are broken up and she starts going out in the evenings. I had been getting suspicious of the amount she had been texting in the recent weeks as she was definitely not the texting type since I had known her and she had also been talking a lot about her personal trainer at her gym. Well I looked at her texts (I know, like several texts per minute for hours at a time.
So I confront her calmly about this and she confesses that she has been really confused of late (hence breaking it off with me) and although there was nothing at all going on with her and her personal trainer

Now starts the very trying times for me, still kissing at times (but not having sex), all the while her ""text relationship"" with her personal trainer grows and grows while all I can do is watch.

Wow this is getting very long, we both agreed that there would be no sex with other people, those were the limits. Anyway about a week after moving she is pretty much with this personal trainer and we talk on the phone and she says that she has already kissed and implies that sex is likely to happen.

Anyway the things I am struggling with that constantly occupy my thoughts are:

* After being with someone for so long, connecting with them everyday, going through so much and having so much together, how does one just go on alone after? How does one move on after what feels like a loss of identity? You feel as if you ""together"" was you, so who the hell are you now?

I simply do not even know you anymore.

All of your standards that you had instilled when we first met have gone along the side of the road

You chose to leave because you felt stuck, and hold onto it like it's gospel. 

And then, it's time you do. It's time you quit lying to yourself. You're moving back to Florida in a few weeks. What are you going to do then?

All of your friends that we had are seeing you for what you really are. WEAK. You are so fucking weak

I could see it on your face the last time I saw you. You are so uncomfortable. You have no sense of normalcy. You don't even have a grasp on what you are losing with our animals. When I lay in bed now, you walked out on there's and you're to WEAK to even attempt to come back and spend time with them, the ones you swore you'd fight over.

And your friends now... or should I say what friends? Your close niche group of people who will as easily forget about you the second you step on that tarmac when you depart from Wisconsin? No one gives a fuck about you

But, has always been there for you. And you've cut me off completely from your life. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR TIME TOGETHER, THIS LAST REMAINING MONTH. There wouldn't have been any bad blood and you could have left for Florida, and I would have seen you off knowing this is what you wanted -- but you didn't. You just ran everything into the ground. And at the end of the day, my dumb ass will probably stand next to you.

BUT NO I WONT

But at the same time I can't. I slept with one of our mutual friends a few times just to pass the time

I want release

YOU NEED HELP. Remember two years ago when I had this same problem

And I still fucking love you above and beyond,,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,True

I am happy now, and now I realize that even though I'd like to be on good terms with her going forward, I really don't care either way, she is just, as gotye says, ""someone that I used to know."" If I run into her, I'll share some kind words if I feel like it, all the ways we hurt each other don't matter anymore. I didn't have much respect for her

I'm going to change the world one day, and I realize that now. I did not like the relationship, I liked being able to have sex and companionship without putting much effort in, and that isn't a relationship, or even healthy.    

So, the advice, feedback, and kind words you have given me, as well as just having a place to vent, have truly put me on the path to becoming a better person. Even the criticism I have received from some of you has opened my eyes to how controlling and insecure I can be, and I'm thankful for your honesty and bluntness.    

No contact works, and hanging out with friends and family. Take the advice guys, and it will get you through it.    

A quote that someone else shared with me that hits home:    

""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

Hurt more now than the breakup and it's my fault,braceletbeads,14,1,17,"So me (22m) and my ex (24f) have been broken up for about 3 weeks after a little over a year-long relationship.  She ended it bc she was getting ""complacent"" and wanted to be single and free again.  It was a bullshit excuse but I couldn't do anythign to change her mind.

Did the normal Reddit thing: delete number

Fast forward to today. She sends me a random text asking how I am and like an idiot I answered and then we had about a 2 hour conversation about everything.  She told me how she has been hooking up with some guy for about 2 weeks and she says she is really happy.  Of course I am heart broken and eventually stop torturing myself and stopped answering.

Moral of the story....DON""T BREAK NO CONTACT.  DONT DONT DONT.  You will end up worse than before.  Listen to all these people because I thought I was the exception to the rule.  There are no exceptions.  You have to stay strong people because I feel like I am back at square one again and just wasted 3 really productive weeks.  Block her number if you have to.

I know i shouldn't beat myself up as much as i am right now

 i broke up with her finally after being obsessively jealous over a more recent indiscretion i found out about that happened in october. it was during finals week right before winter vacation and i just couldn't take the jealousy anymore and had enough. afterwards, texting incessantly with no replies etc. I was with family at this time, so it was easier with their support to ignore her and my feelings about the break-up. But since i've been back at school i've turned into complete shit. 

now: she is officially with another guy. we talked tonight and she said that she wants to finally let me go and has been seeing a guy (i saw them running together down the street a couple weeks ago. ow) and wants to 'do things right with him.' in a way, let alone have her be mine for almost 2 years. But there is SUCH an enormous difference between reaching conclusions and accepting them. 

My friend told me that what I'm feeling makes me human

I wonder how she got over me so fast. I had talked to her in january, but it fucking killed me. I spent almost 2 years with this girl. I can't even think about touching someone else..when I do I get sick to the stomach. Is there something wrong with me?

I also officially have zero self-confidence. I don't know where it went but damn does it suck. I have done everything possible in order to try and socialize: going to concerts

I do wish her the best but i can't help but feel so hurt at the same time. It makes me so sad. The reason I broke up with her in the first place was because I was so jealously obsessed that I was literally going crazy. But do I really feel better now than I did when I was in that relationship? It's really really pathetic that I can't say that I do. It's not the same but just as deep a pain. 

I know that I am blessed with so many things in life, but time passes by so slowly. it's been 3 months and everyday has been a slightly different level of sadness: depression, loneliness, self-esteem issues. when will this ever end? thanks for reading or not, i guess i just wanted to type all that out

I first got together with Lisa when I was 22, but we were also both intelligent, passionate and fiery. We hit it off pretty quickly.

Lisa and I were together for four-and-a-half years. The first two-and-a-half years were more eventful than many longer-lasting relationships. We went through a lot: pregnancy (just a few weeks after we first got together: she eventually decided to get an abortion, but it still hurt me more profoundly than I ever expected it to. The experience shook me into life and pushed us back together still closer.

We could snap at each other and fall out at a moment's notice: frustratingly it always seemed to happen in public, she encouraged me to take a step which seemed far-fetched at the time, and leave my partying lifestyle to go to university. When I found the perfect course in a beautiful, far-away town we leapt into the unknown and decided to make the move together.

The next few months were some of the most exciting of my life: we worked together planning the move

We moved to the new town, I was sobbing with her, begging her to talk. But she wouldn't. I think that she knew that if she did open up, she would be unable to leave me. And I knew that because she wouldn't open up, she was deadly serious. There was no doubting that the love of my life, the girl who had been the centre of my life for almost a quarter of my life was leaving me, for good.

For the first few weeks there was just numbness. I cried a bit on the first couple of days alone, but it felt like I was trying in vain to interact with emotions far stronger than I was able to handle. I just kind of plodded on trying my best just to survive, just to keep going.

After 6 weeks, sobbing uncontrollably. I'd never felt so much emptiness or loneliness: it didn't so much feel that I'd lost a limb, as she'd taken 95% of who I was with her. Not just her but her family, who I loved very much and I knew I would never see again. I felt like almost nothing, the thinnest of shells of a personality, the only part she'd left behind. I knew it was going to take a long, long time to feel better again.

That was exactly five years ago.

The fact that I'm writing this tells me that I haven't completely moved on

The first 0-6 months of a breakup like this are pure survival. I had to just go into auto-pilot and do my best to ignore a lot of the emotions: they were just far too strong to ""deal with"". 

I remember trying to go to bed with another girl 3-4 months after the breakup. I was kidding myself that I was starting to feel better. Oh dear.. what a disaster. that was a wake-up call to give myself more time.

After 6-8 months the edge came off a bit, noticeably decreased. 

It helped so much to have my university course to focus on. This is the biggest advice I would give to anybody in this situation. **Give yourself something huge and extraordinary to achieve**. It should be extremely challenging and expected to take at least a year. Travel, learn to program, just do something amazing. This is a great survival mechanism. I don't know where I'd be without it.

After less than a year I had a fling and the best sex of my life with a great girl. It was a lovely experience. but it was still far too soon and I couldn't develop it into a relationship. That hurt a lot at the time.

It took a full 2.5-3 years for me to stop missing Lisa every single day. The pain was like waves

2-3 years however is a long time.

Finally, but I was so much enjoying being single that I did everything I could to avoid it becoming a relationship.

After another year, I still wasn't emotionally ready for another relationship. I do hope I meet another amazing girl with whom I click to the same degree soon. I think that now, I'm finally ready to throw myself back into love.

I do look back on where I was 10 years ago and compare it where I am now. I'm now 31, however much she broke my heart in the process. I hope she's doing ok, whatever she's doing with herself.

I'm not sure why this is--why there aren't more older people who post--though I have an idea.  It's what they say: you never forget your first love.  Now why is that said?  Is it  because so many spend their lives with their first loves?  Of course it's not.  We say we never forget because we lose them.  

And the older people know.  It never hurts less.  At each age it brings different questions.  But at each age we know we can survive.

You see?  Everyone is like you.  Everyone has had his/her heart broken.  It is as much a part of life as puberty.  If anything

I've been thinking about this lately because I've been reading an author I'm going to recommend to you.  His name is [Jonathan Tropper](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=jonathan+tropper&amp;sprefix=jonathan+tro).  Start with the book right there on top--[The Book of Joe](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Joe-Novel-Jonathan-Tropper/dp/0385338104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322966851&amp;sr=8-1).  Then most likely you'll want to read them all.

It's possible that his main characters are too old for you.  Most are in their late 20s or early/mid 30s.  But all of them, astonishingly realistically, are trying to rebuild.

Here's something he wrote in his novel [This is Where I Leave You](http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322966851&amp;sr=8-8):

*Sometimes, and stop measuring it against what you've lost.  I know this to be wise and true, just as I know that pretty much no one can do it.*

Essentially, or you give up and end your life.  Many have given up.  Suicides are far too common.

But one thing is true: no matter what you do

And, you prevent yourself ever from the possibility of knowing joy again.  Ever from the possibility of knowing love again.  And you verify what your lost love has told you: *that you were not worth it*.

On the other hand, and then the next, and then the next.  If each day you try to find one good thing you can do that won't hurt anyone else and will bring you joy.  In time you will find that while you may not have filled that hole in your heart, which once was bursting with love and hope and, really, innocence, you will have healed it.  You will have let time do its work.  

And you will be ready to love again.

We were dating for 5 yrs and had lived together for 2.

I am 24m she 23F.

Last two weeks we haven't seen each other a lot (she lives on an appartement with a friend) because she always had an excuse.

This week she just told me that she wants a break telling me she isn't sure I am the one for her. She knows she loves me but she just doesn't know if that is enough for her to be happy.

She was feeling very depressed lately and the doctors said that there was nothing wrong so she knew it had to be our relationship.

That night she met a guy going out with her friends and exchanged phone numbers. This happened at the start of the two week period I almost never saw her. They started texting each other

First she started by saying our relationship was fun for a while

Then she said she was doing it for me as well

Then I called her and asked if there was something I should know
That's when she told me what happened.

I spend the night there telling her I would find a place for all this and still love her. I mean

She told me I need to give her some time alone to think. That she really hoped we could be together again

Now two days later she texts me that she is still texting with the guy she cheated on me with and that she might see him again.
I'm all angry like wtf are you doing? This is breaking my heart

I don't know what to do.

I want to give her time to reflect but it just feels like giving up and 
that I am losing it all.

The first sign was 2 weeks previous, two soldiers were walking slow in front of me on the sidewalk and it took all I had to refrain from screaming “FUCKING MOVE” at them. I sent her an e-mail telling her I wanted to come home, that I had a new company lined up and that I missed her. I told her I was struggling terribly with the social isolation, that it was making me crazy and depressed.

I expected a warm, and very luckily the base was attacked a couple minutes prior, so I was sent to check on some people in time to get me out of the building before I broke down. I called her immediately, and we talked and talked, and through it all it came out that while she was having more fun with me not around, that wasn’t something that had to change with me home. She told me she knew we could work our issues out, and it would all be fixed. I was happy for the next 2 weeks.

The second I walked into the house I knew something was wrong, no longer found me attractive. I guess it’s important to say I have always been, by far, the dominant personality in this relationship. Not at this moment. I have never felt more pathetic. I begged and begged. I assumed, naturally, that there was someone else (Note: There wasn’t someone else. While this is my, and everyone elses, there just wasn’t. And to be honest, trying to show her things could change. Looking back on it now I feel so low and pathetic for doing it

She agreed to go to counseling, so naturally my career has taken priority. She said we had grown apart because I’ve been gone as much as I’ve been home. She said, in social settings, she felt that I was so much funnier and more social that she couldn’t be anything but a background object. She felt that I was so much smarter that she couldn’t be an equal. This hurt. I didn’t know what to do. But by the end of the meeting, through tears from both of us, I actually saw progress being made. I was fucking ELATED. I knew I was right about counseling, I knew I was going to be able to get my marriage back and to stay with the person I loved.

I was wrong. Later that night, how happy I was that we were going to be able to fix things. She was once again distant, and that’s the moment I knew it was over. I was emotionally drained. We talked, she said she didn't really want to fix things, I got upset, and I left. I hadn’t even unpacked my bags, so I just grabbed them
A week after that night I went to Vegas with a friend. Half the time I couldn’t even eat. I had an emotional breakdown at training for my new company about 2 weeks after that night. I’ve had terrible ups and downs in between, life is grand. I’m back in Iraq now, which is good for distraction. I dated a girl during the last 3 months of my time home, and while it distracted me at first, I knew the pain was always still there, I was just avoiding it. 

There’s been some... drama? wherein she’s still on my car insurance because the divorce isn’t finalized, she would ignore texts for 3-4 days at a time, until I would call her work (nothing crazy, just a “hey, stop ignoring my texts”.. this always worked). She was frustrated because she couldn’t pay the bills. While I’m sympathetic because I still care deeply about her, I won’t pay her bills.

I called her just now to try to figure out how close to finalized the divorce is, not even worth trying to repair what we had. I have no idea how to recover. I dream about her a couple times a week. Once, it was her walking away. I tried to convince her to come back, and finally she did... then she decided to leave anyways. I kept calling to her as she walked away, but she never even looked back.

Senior year of college, sacrificing sleep, friends, food, etc. to squeeze out every minute in her presence I could.

We graduated in summer 2009 and then traveled together that summer. But when the fall came, gifts, etc.) But I realized it wouldn't last unless we were together. So I decided to move to Mozambique in January 2010.

As soon as I got there things were off. She was short and cold with me and we fought a lot, when she was out until 5am but I stayed home, I saw an unlabeled book on my pillow as I went to bed. I opened it and saw it was her diary. I closed it because I didn't want to snoop, but not before I noticed the words ""five-night stand."" My heart sank. She'd been having an affair with some guy named Allen.

I promptly packed up my things and flew back to the US a couple days later

Fast forward a year, she was incredibly contrite and remorseful and it seemed as though there could even be a budding romance because she was moving to my city soon. Though at first really excited at the possibility, I began to worry more whether things would be different this time and whether she would be willing to do what she had to do to earn my trust back. Long story short, we weren't romantically involved for the first three months she was in town. I saw other girls, but each time, I would end up comparing them to Andrea and found them woefully lacking. Andrea was the one I thought about when I went to sleep. I couldn't be with other girls when I only thought of her.

So I spilled my guts to her a week ago. She cried and told me she'd had the same feelings, sending notes, links, just like old times. I was so excited.

I went to her house last night and towards the end of the night I asked her straight up if she'd given any more thought to what we'd talked about last week. After I told her again how much I still cared for her, that she didn't think she was willing to do what would be necessary to earn back my trust. I quietly took my leave and rode home listening to whatever sad song I could find. She called an hour ago. She told me she had to be honest with me, that she'd be seeing someone. With him since March. My heart sank again. It felt like Mozambique all over again.

I'm heartbroken. Over Africa. Over the year spent trying to get over her. Over letting myself fall back in love with her. Over getting trampled on again. Over loving her and not being able to have her. Over loving her and not getting her love back.

My good buddy is still friends with her on facebook and was able to see all of her info and stuff. He basically told me that she pretty much didn't have any pictures of me, was that she has herself listed as in a relationship with the guy she left me for, and that struck a nerve. I knew she left me for someone, however I was just assuming it. I had no actual evidence and this was a blow to my ego. 

This whole time I was kinda hoping that she would realize she misses me, (3 times) she has left me for a guy only or a short period of time, then would come back to me. This time however it is different. Something must have clicked for the two of them and they have been going strong now for 3 months. So it looks like this might be one of those rebound relationships that blossom into a beautiful marriage and blah blah blah. FUCK I hate this shit and wish she would have been faithful to me and just loved me for me.

My relationship was a prison. I don't mean all relationships are, but she was allowed to go wherever she wanted. I was not allowed to ask for sex, but I had to be ready whenever she wanted it.

I was constantly depressed. Being free and happy has made it very clear that I was very depressed in my relationship. I gained a lot of weight, much leaner (45lbs down), and very motivated. I also now have a persona and identity, before I was whatever my ex wanted me to be. I have become my own person, still with some work to do but, I have my own feelings and personality.

I have some great friends and some not-so-great friends. Immediately after the breakup, I would hear about it and how I need to go back to her. On the other hand, I had friends that quit contacting her, stood by my side every time I needed support, and were always helping me keep my head on straight.

I have some things I need to work on. I'm particularly sheepish in social situations and i'm working on it. I try to take the lead, but my social situations and friends were controlled by my SO. I also have a tendency to not want to try new things, I made a goal to do at least one new thing each week. So far, I've started doing bi-nightly walks on the boardwalk, I've tried 10 new restaurants, started doing monthly exercise routines, and I went down to the city to do a pub crawl.

And I did. And to the surprise of my oh-so-broken-heart

You have to understand Reddit, stupid ones, passionate ones. But I have always tried to work it out in the end, to at least hear someone out. So to have someone just suddenly break up with me and give me vague answers angers me as well as breaks me. 

So now I am just a mess, my heart still hurts. All I keep thinking is 'Who is going to watch Star Trek with me?' I felt like I really found a great friend, and a great partner, someone that made me feel normal when all my life I have been teased by my hobbies and other quirks. I tried my hardest, to be honest, not clingy, and clear as possible with my expectations and emotions. Not only that, that maybe he didn't control his emotions and didn't realize what he was getting himself into. I just feel betrayed

I mean what I said three months ago, better than I'd expect it to go, and I regret that I wasted almost a year with you when it could have been with her.

In fact, hanging out with your friends. Three months later and you still stay in almost every night playing games rather than having a social life. That's a fucking joke. I held you back? I'm nowhere around you and you do the exact same shit you did when we dated. I wasn't holding you back from anything I was the only thing that made you happy.

I know you're depressed, you deserve it. You are a terrible person, not only because of what you did to me but because of other things I won't mention on here.

Best of luck to everyone reading this in your break ups. Smile,,

when i realized he didnt send me anything for my birthday, i do deserve everything he refused to give me.  im not gonna sit here and tell you it was easy to make the decision to end things once and for all. it wasnt, it took me weeks.  thankfully i have a good support system and i finally did it!  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted guys.   I can now do what i want and be who i am without fear.   break ups are hard but staying in one where you are unhappy is even harder.  so remind yourselves every day that its OK to be yourself, and they dont love you for that, at least you do, and nothing is better then believing in yourself.

1361667887.0,193wvq,I (24) broke up - more or less! - with my long distance gf (22) 6 months ago. At Christmas she cut off all contact. Suddenly feeling the pain and regret.,strangelyblue,16,3,2,"Well... that's it! From one English speaking side of the world to another, and our last pre-breakup visit was actually the best

In all honesty by this point the relationship had become fairly one-sided, and she unfortunately ended up suffering with that and some other vague addiction problems... I'm not really sure how that affected things exactly, but obviously it didn't help! But when she visited we always had fun - or actually, and what I suppose shows how 'real' our relationship was - though I didn't realise it at the time - was just how 'settled' that fun was. We didn't feel the need to go out and have loads of exciting events on. We just stayed in and watched tv together, watched our favourite shows together, learned random facts together, made up silly games with our cuddly toys together. I'd get annoyed with certain things about her - sometimes a bit obnoxious with her political views, and I sometimes imagined some of her habits were a little gross - but thinking back none of them were really too serious. I think a lot of it was my super-high expectations combined with my depression getting in the way of things. I don't know.

But anyway all this ended up getting to me and, and a month or so later she skyped me and broke up with me properly... in a way I was relieved - I'd had so many doubts about how things would possibly work - I'd feel too guilty moving as I'm an only child and have very clingy and easily upset parents, plus a bunch of other stuff - but obviously also not great. Also I'm ashamed to say I'd been sort of getting together with another girl... this was actually totally 'allowed' by our relationship contract - she was doing some guys as well too - but, as the relationship looked semi-doomed, I did have it in my mind that maybe things could get more serious with this other girl if that officially failed.

Anyway, and we talked about how hard that was. Some months later, around Christmas, I noticed we hadn't really spoken in a couple of weeks - I'd been busy and away - and sent her a quick message asking how she was. Her reply broke me to pieces: she wished me the best, but said she'd found someone else - who wasn't terrible and didn't treat her badly etc - and didn't see where I fit into her life now, and that we shouldn't speak. I replied saying how sorry I was for any time I'd hurt her and I hoped we could still be friends, but no reply. I tried to respect her feelings and just leave it at that. But God.  I lost my virginity to this girl, and, really was... until it dried up for good.

I've tried to block a lot of that out since then. I'm actually still vaguely seeing this other girl, but just not over the loss of the relationship? Our relationship status was so fuzzy towards the end, as was the beginnings of my thing with the new girl, so I suppose I haven't really had a proper time to grieve for the relationship and figure things out.

I'm so scared that I've lost what was possibly my perfect partner for good - maybe I should have moved? Maybe I still could - I'm not certain she really has found a new partner and isn't just saying so as a way to move on and deal with the pain of the loss from her end

Anyway I was a bit of an idiot and sent her an email earlier, just explaining how I recognise I didn't appreciate a lot of the good stuff during our relationship and how sorry I was. I made it clear I wasn't trying to win her back against her will or whatever... just that we were maybe both a little stronger now, and that it wouldn't hurt for us to at least talk... we really do have so much in common - and not just the bad stuff like depression! although of course that was a comfort knowing somebody understood what you were going through. I doubt she'll read it, but I pray to God she does and at some point agrees to just talk. Maybe we're not right for each other, but the idea that decades could pass - that one of us could die - without us ever talking again, with this girl I shared so much of my life with... freaks me out and genuinely scares me so much.

I'm really sorry that this has turned into a bit of a rant, or just feel you can help... please do

That's all I'm feeling right now

The first week was awful without you, replaying everything in my head wondering how I could possibly spend a day without you in it. I cried a lot &amp; just felt completely lost. 

After clearing my head &amp; looking back on everything over the past 6 years

I love so many things about you:

* Your smile
* Your infectious personality
* Your drive
* The way everything felt perfect when you were around and I was wrapped up in your arms.
* You always made me feel like things were going to be okay.
* The way you pushed me to step out of my bubble
* Good listener.


But there was also so much that drove me crazy about you;

* You are terrible at keeping plans
* Never made me feel like a priority
* Your communication skills are terrible
* Selfish 
* You often talk about people behind their backs.
* You weren’t really good with romance. I want someone who will buy me flowers just because
* I felt like a backup.
* You never wanted to talk about conflict; you bottle everything up until you shut down &amp; would ignore me for days until you figured it out yourself.


We've gone through SO much together in the past 6 years &amp; I was so in love with the idea of being with you that I pushed aside so many of my feelings &amp; put up with so much bullshit from you. You made me feel like I wasn't good enough, or to make spontaneous plans. You were a better friend than a boyfriend.
I hated having to be scheduled in to your life. 


I hate even more that I allowed myself be walked all over, I took a chance and followed my heart. I knew that if this relationship didn’t work out, our long friendship would be over as well, but I held on hoping that it’d be okay. I hate even more that you looked at your life and decided that you just couldn’t have a girlfriend, that I was the one thing out of many that could be replaced. I understand being stressed and overwhelmed and not knowing what you want with your life but it’s pretty shitty that you felt as though you couldn’t talk to me about it. 


Not everything was bad though, new relationships/breakups, staying up all night talking about nothing, countless concerts, graduations, post-secondary life, life crises, sneaking around trying to convince everyone we were just friends (which sometimes lead to jealousy, feeling like we could just take on the world  &amp; SO much more. 


Now

 
I can’t do that anymore, really sad to look at everything and know that it’s best for both of us to open new chapters in our lives. You slept with someone less than a week after we broke up, you showed her off like she was some sort of prize in front of all of our friends – maybe that’s your way of coping with everything. It just shows a lack of respect on your part. You were supposed to call &amp; you didn’t - you broke another promise which sealed the deal. You’re not reliable and need to grow up a lot &amp; I wish you could have done so with me around, but you won’t because I’ve always been there for you when you fuck up. It’s time for me to find out what life is like without you in it. 


I just want you to be happy. I know you will be - I know you’ll figure everything out &amp; follow through with all your dreams. Maybe sometime in the future we’ll be able to talk again

Through mutual friends I heard that he went off the deep end: started drinking heavily, hating &amp; hurting each other and sleeping together between relationships. It was a bad cycle. 

I dropped off the radar, and I didn't really see him anymore. I  moved forward, grew up, fell in love. I don't regret that our relationship ended, because I met my fiancee and couldn't be happier now. I am a different person now because of that experience.

Genuinely polite and friendly, life, work; we spoke briefly about a mutual friend who is travelling in a different country; we talked about our current relationships; we hugged and said goodbye and that was it. Even after all the drama and pain we put eachother through, it was possible to see one another again after a few years and smile genuinely.

I remind him how I didn't want this relationship when we started dating a year ago. Because I was afraid of being around people again after my marriage fell apart. I was afraid to find out that I was right, rude, and most of all, stupid.

I give him all the examples I have where he revised history in his mind to make his memories more conducive to his point of view or state of mind.

I tell him that I have a right to be unhappy with someone treating me poorly. That his dismissiveness was the most hurtful thing of all. YOU ALMOST HIT ME WITH YOUR CAR BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO WATCH ME IN THE MIRROR. MAYBE IF I HAD BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME

And when I start to get angry is about where I stop. I know this part is unhealthy, and then I seal it off from the rest of my mind so I can focus on other things.

Therapist told me these things:

* There is no cure that can help me

* I will carry her shadow with me to the next relationships and I will always search for her in new persons.

* There is no such thing ""you only love once""

This all happened a week after our trips. I was a walking shell for all but two days. My friends came to my rescue and bounced me back to life. After the dust settled and I had a chance to look back and reflect on the last 5 years, and acceptable these notions as an inevitability of life. 

During our break up discussion and my post break up contemplation

1. We both set exceptions for one another and failed to meet them.
2. We never communicated about our feelings/desires anymore. 
3. When we got angry with one another we would have our fight but never really resolve anything. It would bottle up into this massive ball of hatred and erupt about once a year around the same time.
4. Sex was out the window.
5. She hated that I quit my job to pursue my dream and would have rather had me working than going to grad school.
6. She wanted a ring, that I wasn't interested in marriage until I felt I was ready (i.e., finished my schooling, got my job, established a foundation to build a future with someone). I don't want to start a future with someone and have to struggle to build a life. I wanted to be self-sufficient first.
7. She never did anything for me ever if it didn't mean she wouldn't get something in return.
8. She cheated on me twice, who knows. I should have walked away after the first time.

I have to thank her though. I learned so much from being with her and I've managed to grow as a person out of all of this. Despite our failure to mature as a couple together I've matured as a human being. However

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, I'll be up at school in just over 6 weeks, where we'll be living down the block from each other.

We had been dating since we were 15. She knows my Reddit account and I don't want her to kick me anymore while i'm down. I need to vent


It started in 7th grade(about 13 years old) when I met her. I was an extremely overweight kid. No girl had ever given me a chance to really talk to them at this point in my life, but this girl was completely out of my league. We quickly became best friends from then on and I would give her advice on everything she struggled with, which was mostly guy problems. I was essentially friend zoning myself and I didn't even realize it because I was only in 7th grade. But I continued to be there for her through anything. This continued for about 2 years.


We get to high school and it's a new and exciting time. I have lost around 70 pounds from training to play football at this point. Our friendship is as strong as ever. Within the first month of high school she has her group of friends tell me that she likes me. I didn't believe it for a solid month


She said yes to my complete surprise. People thought it was a joke that she was dating me. From then on I made sure she was the happiest girl in the world. We would get made fun of everyday because of how attached we were. We would literally be holding hands the entire time we were together. She became my first kiss about 3 months into dating. I was too nervous to make the first move so she did. I had never been happier after that though.


Well after about a year she ""cheats"" on me. She kisses an ex boyfriend who I had given her advice on. It crushes me but we remained friends. I couldn't live without her. Me dating her made other girls curious about me. I had more girls texting me and calling me than I could believe after we broke up. I ""hook up"" with a few (if you can even call making out hooking up). About 5 months pass since we broke up. She apologizes in tears for everything.


We start dating again. We lose our virginity to each other during this time. But sadly the relationship only lasts for 3 months. A 21 year old who helped out the teacher in one of her classes started chasing after her. She apparently tells him everything and he convinced her that I was only dating her to get into her pants. He told her she was going to get hurt dating me. So she breaks up with me again.... And of course starts dating him.


Well we stop talking after that and she dates him for about a year. I still love her after all this time


This is when the real relationship begins. We were starting our 3rd year(junior year) in high school. We were both determined to make this work. About 10 months of us dating pass and something we were never ready for came up. She had gotten pregnant. We made the toughest decision in our lives to abort the baby. We both decided we couldn't provide the life a baby deserves. It cuts me deep but I have to stay strong for her. I still to this day carry around the ultrasound of the kid everywhere I go. It has been my inspiration to become a better person. No one besides us to this day knows about the abortion. After the abortion our relationship grows so much closer.


We continue to be the happiest couple throughout high school. We communicate, I would get excited to see her texts and calls come in. High school finally ends and I get a summer internship offer at Google and 3 universities offering a full ride scholarship. The closest being a school about 2 hours away. She didn't perform too well in school so she decided to stick with community college in the town we had lived in. At this point we decide we were going to stay together throughout college. Because of this I decide to stay as close as possible. I go to the college that is 2 hours away.


This is where our relationship starts to strain. I move out for the first time with roommates I don't know. My original roommate was supposed to be a 27 year old bank teller. But he didn't really live well with others so I end up with the only other apartment they have open at the time. This apartment was co-ed. I was going to be living with 2 girls for my freshman year. Imagine my girlfriend's excitement when she heard this. I can tell she's hurting at this point. She wants to move in so bad with me but I didn't want to put her in a bad financial situation. I told her it wasn't worth the debt to get the same community college education 2 hours down the road. (I understand how dumb that sounds now but if we were truly staying together long term I wanted to keep us in good financial standing. I regret that decision still to this day.) I drive up each and every single weekend during the school year to see her. I wanted her to know I love her and cared about her. I still surprise her with dates and flowers. Over the summer I would stay at my parent's house and bring her lunch at work everyday.


We go another year of doing the same thing except I live alone this time. This next year we had planned to move in together. I still drive up every weekend in order to see her. And In order to show her I love her. Well because of this and because I have to keep a high GPA for my scholarship I don't and still don't have a social life in college. I work hard all week so that I don't have any homework left over for the weekend. Our relationship is still strong this entire school year.


This last month when summer started has been where it got bumpy. She starts to tell me she doesn't want to go to my school anymore. She wants to follow her dreams and go into fashion merchandising... This kind of saddens me but I tell her to go for it. Shoot for the stars. The problem is that the fashion school she wants to go to is 8 hours from my school. We definitely would have to have a long distance relationship at that point. No more seeing each other every weekend. This puts strain back on our relationship. I tell her I still completely support her with whatever she wants to do though. We have been dating continuously for one month short of 4 years now.


Well then comes the past few weeks. She starts to ignore my calls and texts. She bails on dates I had planned for her. I learn from a mutual friend that she has been hanging out with other guys in our group when she would tell me that she's sick and can't go out. This makes me saddened inside but I didn't know how to confront her about it. She becomes moody with me all the time. She doesn't know that I know what she has been up to.


Then this week comes. The week that has crushed me completely as a person. She tells me that she has fallen out of love with me. She doesn't get happy when she sees me anymore. She gets annoyed when she sees my face. She hates how I love to spend time with my family and that I am a mommy's boy. She tells me that she hates that I give my dog so much attention. She hates what I wear. She tells me she wants to see other people. She says that she has been in relationships all of her life and she doesn't even know who she is. She doesn't know if I'm the best she wants to see if there are better guys out there. She wants to make stupid decisions and live with them. She wants to hook up with a random guy and regret it. She wants to ""find herself"". And after that she ""finds herself"" we should get back together and get married. I told her things don't work that way. I'm not going to sit here and wait while she hooks up with a bunch of guys and then just take her back. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


Mind you this all came within a couple of days. She built all of this up and just exploded these past few days. I told her she needs to tell me these things and not let them build up like this. I can try to fix things but I can't fix everything at once. I've always been fine with her talking to other guys and making new friends. I never breached her privacy in any way. I trusted her. I loved her. I tried to continue to surprise her as much as possible. I took her out on fun dates. I loved to make her happy that was all I ever wanted since I met her. I had tried my hardest at that point to be the best boyfriend I could be.


For the last few days she tried to end everything over text. She didn't even try to do that with our shorter relationships. But I told her our friendship is worth more than that and she knows that. I couldn't just let an 8 year friendship end over a text.


Well tonight ended our relationship


We met up at the park where we first started hanging out 8 years ago. I hadn't seen her since a week ago. This part may sound weird but I had decided I wanted to end our relationship on a happy note not a sad one. I knew she was done with me it was inevitable at this point but I wanted her to look back and constantly wonder why our relationship and friendship ended. We went and got milkshakes and went ice skating like we were just on another date. It was a great time until it came time to say goodbye. I broke down. We hugged for a hour straight. We cried in each other's shoulders for a hour straight. We didn't say a word for that hour. After that hour of breaking down I gave her a piece of me


**My questions are:**



* I've realized I don't even know how to make new friends anymore. I don't want to stay in the same mutual group of friends as her. I know it will only hurt me and I'll never get over her that way... What do i do over the summer to make new friends? How do you even approach people without being creepy? I have a connection to get hundreds of baseball tickets to all the our local MLB team's games


* Are there steps I should be taking right now to help this process?

Dear  You

How have you been?

It’s been a while since we talked last so I’ll try not to talk to fast.

It’s been hard for me not having you around. I keep asking myself why I broke up with you and I can’t come up with a definite answer. Isn’t that funny? I just couldn’t be with you anymore. Something about our relationship didn’t seem right. I can’t tell you what it is because no matter how much I try to pin it down I don’t know what it is

“He was a major part of your life; of course you’ll miss him; it’s perfectly normal. It’s like getting a tooth pulled out; after the dentist pulls it, and sometimes you see yourself missing it terribly. It’s going to take a while, but it always takes some time. Should you have kept the tooth? No, because it was causing you pain. Pulling the tooth was the right decision, but it’s still going to hurt.”

This is how I feel about us. At one point you felt so right in my life. You were a tooth to me. You were part of me that helped me get through my day, when you try to put a tooth you pulled out back in, it’ll stay for a little, but then fall out again because in the end it’s no longer part of you.  And that’s what I tried to do. Put you back in. That putting the tooth I pulled out back in would put things back to normal, but the truth is it doesn’t. Once you pull a tooth out, it’s no longer part of the body, and it stops growing. 

I miss you so much you have no idea. I wake up day after day and you’re the first thing that comes to mind

But in the end it’s called a break up because it’s broken, so I should have stayed out of yours. For that I’m sorry. I really am.

I hope that if this letter ever gets to you

For the past two years you’ve helped me through so many hard times and through so many good ones. You’ll always be a part of me that I’ll never forget. I’m sorry that I’ve tried to put you back in to my life so many times. I should’ve seen that it would just end in heartbreak

I hope that one day you’ll say hi to me and that we can talk about how we’ve been and that I can clear up anything I’ve confused you about. 

Life goes on and we have to go along with it. That’s something that I’m still trying to do with us. I hope that the next guy that steals your heart will be just as amazing as I am and you can be assured that the next girl to steal mine will be just as amazing as you

You have given me love. You showed me how to be so happy that I cried tears of joy; something only you did for me. It’s been said that the greatest kind of love is the one that awakens your soul and makes you reach for more. It plants a fire in your heart and gives you peace in mind. You’ll always be the girl that did that for me, I did that for you. Thank you for everything. Every day I thank whoever runs this universe that you were chose to be my first love and I was chosen to be loved by you. 

Thank you.

Sincerely

Me

I figure the best place to vent about this is somewhere I'm (relatively) anonymous. Strangers give completely unbiased advice

I'm 29, let's chat"" kind of thing...but it quickly developed into way, way more. Constant texting for pretty much whenever we were both awake and near our phones, 4 hour skype conversations, both of us admitting our feelings and how much it sucked that we lived so far apart, but made plans to visit soon...he had to get his tax return so he could get his passport renewed and stay here for a week (I couldn't go there due to anxiety but that's irrelevant).

I've deleted our text history, how he couldn't wait to jump off the bus and hold me, good morning/goodnight messages every day, and how he hoped I fall in love with him...obviously I was on cloud 9, because not only was I also immensely attracted to him, I hadn't known someone I was so compatible with in years, if ever at all.
A few days before whatever happened, and he would do the same, so we could have a candle-lit skype dinner. Yeah, I know. But I loved it, and I thought he did too since he made a point to post about what a ""beautiful night"" we had.

Fast forward to Feb 18th. That was the last time I heard from him. Everything just...stopped. I assumed he was just sleeping off his weekend hangover

I also noticed he hadn't (and still hasn't) posted on Facebook. At all. It's like he just dropped off the grid. I started to get worried he was in the hospital or in jail or something...so I sent his sister a message asking if he was alright. She said she hadn't heard from him either so she'd get her boyfriend to call.

That was the last I heard from her.

A week and a bit ago, but I hope he would tell me what was up soon.
So it's now...I still haven't heard from him, and I've deleted his number so I don't text him.

I CANNOT shake this. I don't know what's wrong with me. I literally give no fuck if he met someone

Moreso...wouldn't it have been easier to just block me or unfriend me online than to go to the trouble of avoiding the internet almost entirely if he did in fact want to avoid me?

And before I get accused of it, after spending months making me think he was totally nuts over me.

Has this ever happened to anyone? I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm stupid for putting faith in someone I have never met


TL;DR: girl meets guy, girl is super sad.


**UPDATE:** Literally by accident found a post he made this afternoon (19th), just reading my messages and then carrying on with whatever...I can't even. I was fine, now I feel totally duped and stupid. I poured my heart out to someone who probably just laughed it off....ugh. :(

I know every ending of a meaningful relationship hurts in its own way. Many of the posts here come from those who have had to endure heartbreak due to their former relationship partner's hurtful actions eventually leading to the ending of the relationship. Now I don't want to generalize

Here though, lying, etc.). In other words, acted like real immature human beings towards somebody who genuinely loved, trusted and respected them.

How did you view your actions over time? How did you feel about what you had done? Did you feel guilt, and never looked back or had any regrets? Did you feel your actions were justified because you no longer loved them (at least in the romantic sense) and so did it for their sake? How did your perspective and emotions change over time? Do you still feel pained by your own actions, or has it lessened so that you've all but forgotten it now?

Did you ever feel like talking to your ex afterwards, how did it go, what did you talk about? Was there bitterness, or did you meet in the spirit of reconciliation? Are you happy that you enabled yourself to have that meeting?

Do you feel you are a better human being today as a result of all that happened, or already have?

So

I would like to request (it's already mentioned in the group rules, for others to be considerate to those who are sharing their stories and not condemn them for their actions in the past, since none of us are entirely immune from 'judging' others. I'll appreciate all your responses.

1328053116.0,p59zd,Something I think everyone needs to hear.,P33J,13,1,5,"So I've been reading through the various break-up threads and the AskReddit Threads. There's often two common themes in many of these threads: 1. What do I need to change about me to stop getting dumped? and 2. My Ex is a __________ (insert gender appropriate insult) for dumping me.

The problem is

The truth is much more simple and complex. The reason your ex broke up with you isn't because you weren't going anywhere in life

The reason your ex broke up with you is because your ex doesn't love you anymore. Even if they tell you they do

There's nothing you can do to change this. And that's not a bad thing.

I know what Hollywood has told you. That if you just work out a little, she'll come back to you. But that's bullshit. It's bullshit brought to you by the same people who sell you gym memberships, contacts, and dancing lessons. You know how I know this, I write ads, I prey on your insecurities to get you to buy into this bullshit.

Your Ex realized a little sooner, she realized this before you go married or moved in together or purchased something cool that would suck to split. But the truth remains, eventually you both were going to fall out of love with each other.

Which leads us to the second fallacy, doesn't make the other person evil. Jessica Alba and I aren't a good match, does that make her a bad person for not being with me? The same is true for your ex.

Sure, she did you a favor. Now you're free to find the person that loves you for what you are. 

No

The truth is, there is someone out there who will make you much happier than your ex, even if *gasp* it still is your ex, but the person your ex becomes 5 years from now.

Trust me, you don't have a ton of time on this world to waste it wishing for something that's gone.

But how do I know

Well 10 years ago today

It took me 2 years to realize that I didn't need to change. It was ok that she didn't love me. Not because she was an awful person

And when I realized that. I realized that I need to do the same thing she had done 2 years earlier. 2 years later, who look like their mother and I go home to my best friend and the woman  I can't resist every night.

Remember that. Because it's hard to make room in your heart to love someone

I find that this especially helps with the nostalgia.  It's hard to let go of those good memories and wanting things to go back to the way they were.  That'll take time to work out.  Acknowledge those feelings and try to look at them from a different perspective.  The relationship had some great moments, and take a moment to feel better about yourself and how you'll make a future relationship great.

We went grocery shopping and she left to go hang out with our mutual friends while I drove home to put away all the groceries last night. (Me doing all the work on my broken ankle

After that, gets pissed when I hang out with, etc. He said that my gf is telling everyone she is single, has been SUPER flirty and tried to sleep with my friend John (who was a true bro and told her to fuck off). Everyone there is confused by her actions. What she tells them is not what she tells me.

So I told her straight up last night - I am done trying. This is over. You are telling all of my friends it is over and are treating me like shit.

I ignored her most of the night because - as she says - we are not dating. We were hanging out with all of our mutual friends and she was definitely the odd man out. Since she tells all of them that we are not dating

Later we went home. *She grabbed a fucking steak knife and stabbed herself in the leg four times while screaming at me that she was sorry.* It wasn't attractive. It was sad. This poor girl can't lead me on anymore.

It was the first time she has said sorry for all the mean actions the past two months

In life, they’re there to teach you something about yourself. They left because either you need to better yourself or you need to learn something. Nothing is forever. And not everything works out. And it’s okay to be sad if something is out of your life, but don’t let it hinder you. Don’t let it stop you from doing you. And yes you can remember the good times, but honestly, the bads outweigh it. You deserve to be treated super special. You deserve to have someone want to buy you flowers on Valentine’s Day or to just call because they want to know what you are up to. Or even text you to know that they are thinking about you. You don’t want to have to spell that out for someone and with the right person, you won’t have to. 

He wasn’t meant for you. You weren’t meant to be together

But you will learn from it. And you will grow so much more because of it. You’re going to be a better person because it’s a learning curve and progress is not linear. It goes up and down, you tried so hard to fix it and that’s that. You can’t fix everything, some people are just not meant to be together and you have to accept that. You tried your best, and nothing you could have done could make him stay.

And no you shouldn’t be friends with him. And don’t give into that. You’re stronger than that and you’re amazing. So just keep your head up and you are going to go so far. I love you.

I had a kind of tumultuous year-long relationship with a beautiful but rather volatile woman that ended about a year ago. She had issues with insecurity, and I brought my anxiety and occasional depression to the table. Basically, she was temperamental and angry, and I was withdrawn and emotionally unavailable (as she put it, though I did try to be as ""available"" as possible).

I initiated no contact and actually moved away to be closer to my work. I heard through the grapevine that she had moved on very quickly to a succession of short relationships with what I would consider to be unfit partners - including my former roommate whose emotional disconnection made mine pale in comparison.

I didn't try to date in the past year and have just been working on things that I enjoy and staying as busy as possible. I've actually gotten to a point where I'm rather happy these days, when I want. Selfish, I know! And I'm okay with that.

I ran into her once at a party last New Year's (she was with the former roommate and friend that night, and that was it.

I've missed her like crazy at times

The other day I woke up and found a text she had sent late the previous night: ""I miss you

It was very odd to see - in one way, and myself in indulging in somewhat self-destructive behaviors (drinking, smoking).

This extended crush takes its toll on my life, but after feeling like this for more than 100 weeks, I am exhausted. By now a lot of these habits are just that: habits. And I have joined dating sites twice, but with little success (I couldn't bring myself to meet anyone in person). I suspect that on some level, I still believe we might someday get together again, and this is holding me back from a full level of commitment to the get-over.

I hate being that person

**The background:**

Our relationship, but so is he (or I thought so?). He used this proposal - after we had told our friends and family - as a chance to tell me how he ""really feels"" about my ""smothering him."" 

**Some background about how I proposed:**

* All I want is his love,"" because he means so much more to me than that.
* I had his ring custom made. We met on a bike ride, which was me giving him one of my red feathers. It didn't cost much, and I used the rest of the money we would have spent on a ring on an international trip - which we will in theory be going on at the beginning of June (he always said that he'd rather spend money on travel than on an engagement/wedding, and I agreed).
* Everything seemed okay - he said yes to my proposal, it's a big life change). Then, we went out to our favorite restaurant to ""celebrate,"" and along the way - while still on the subway train - he started to tell me how he really felt.
* He started out by telling me, and I laughed, but then he gave me a very strong hug to prove his point - almost a violent hug - and he accidentally slammed my glasses into my nose. This hurt physically on top of what I was feeling emotionally, and I started to get sad and suspicious that he didn't quite feel the same way I did.
* We get outside and take a walk before heading into the restaurant. I try to explain to him that I don't even care if we have a wedding - or if we're engaged for the next 10 years. I literally just wanted to show him how much he meant to me, and I of course thought he felt the same way towards me, or I wouldn't have asked him.
* We ended the night with lots of drinks, but I feel like I've been hit by a truck. He said that he was excited for me to start my new job, because he knew I'd have longer hours, and he was looking forward to the alone time. He told me that when I flew home for the weekend last week, he really enjoyed that time alone. These are all things that are totally fine - alone time that I would have gladly given him - but he really hasn't spoken up until now. He just assumed I would ""get it,"" and I didn't, because I'm the needy one. I'm the OAG, but it seemed like we stopped needing it. Turns out
* We live together, or this will have to end. And I'm not sure that I can change. I'm a goddamn needy person, and part of me asking him to marry me was admitting that I'm a needy person...and assuming he knew and loved me despite. I'm not Autistic, so my neediness was revealed little by little throughout our relationship - like a normal person. I'm not OAG in many ways (I usually don't talk about it when I feel needy), but when I love someone, I latch on. This has caused a few unrequited love situations in my life where people never even knew how I felt about them. 

I don't know how to move forward. I'm hurting so bad, but I feel like I was broken up with. My world feels like it's crumbling down, and our relationship seems like it was built on top of lies. He was just pretending to be as needy as me, maybe because he didn't want to hurt me. But it wasn't true. None of it was true.

Now I don't know what to do. I can't move, so I guess I could leave then, but what to do in the meantime?

I feel like I can't heal unless we take some time off

I took off work today and told my boss that we had a death in the family. The truth is, maybe? Go up to Portland? But I feel like that would just be me being sad in another city...I'm not very good at traveling alone. Or being alone for that matter. Like I said, I'm needy.

So, I flew out to see her. Much to my SHOCK, she broke up with me the first night I was there. Who does that? Why wouldn't she just wait to see how my visit there goes before springing the news on me.

weeks prior to me flying over there

oh okay. cool. let's just not discuss our relationship as a couple. Just make this decision for the both of us. It's not like I've been the optimist the entire time, to keep the relationship going despite the distance...oh no wait, that's totally what I did THE ENTIRE TIME.

""Is this something we can talk about?"" was the first thing I said after you sprung the news on me. You just shook your head. I ""didn't do anything wrong""...and I ""shouldn't feel like I failed you because you failed me""....but you still love me...a lot...Then you urged me not to talk about it at all during my stay. ""Let's just enjoy this"". No. You broke up with me, that's bullshit.

""Not now"" is what you said when I let my emotions creep in and put in a ""mood"" around you. Then when? hmm? when? When would be a good time for you? Let me just wait around until it's a ""good time"" for you to talk

So now I fly back home...and you want NC...because...something...idk...you broke up with me because you couldn't handle the distance...then I get back

Oh no but you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to talk AT ALL. You don't want me to talk until I'm ""feeling 100% about everything again"" because you want to continue to be friends.

No. Do you have any fucking idea how much of myself I devoted to you? How much of my life I shared with you? You stayed in my fucking house for 3 fucking months. You became great friends with my little sister...my mom fell in love with you...you became her ""daughter in law""...

SO many things in my life are tainted now

Certain animals you taught me about? Nope

Certain animals I taught you about? Nope

Certain foods you introduced me to? Nope

Certain foods I introduced you to? Nope

Certain shows you introduced me to? shows I introduced you to? movies? bands? songs? ideas? knowledge?  Nope. They're all ruined.

Neither one of us is doing this correctly. Neither one of us is doing the right thing. Somewhere between my desire to hold to every thought

Do I still love you? Yes

Am I still in love with you? Yes

Do I want you back? Yes but it'd be different.

Am I going to sit around and wait until you come back? I can't. 

Should you sit around and wait for me to be 100%? I want you to...but I have no idea how long that'll be.

Once we hit 18 we moved into the city together to study, because had a found someone to study with (we go to different universities) and he basically told her to be there with him or she'd fail her studies. At one point she starts texting with him every night non-stop after getting back home until she went to bed, despite my attempts at getting her to be with me at least when we were together at home.

We weren't going out as much as we did when we got together, she ignored my presence altogether. At eventually voiced my concern for our relationship, asking her to spend a little less time at the library and some more time with me, despite feeling like a gigantic douche asking her to favor me over her studies, request which she ignored. I feel like I know this is going to end, but I'm in love with her, so I continue to try.

Fast forward two months and it's a saturday. I spent the whole week making sure we'd go out on that day, I confront her about the situation. She tells me she slept with library guy saturday night and tells me it's over. I feel empty inside, destroyed. This was two weeks ago. I still feel completely destroyed.

Financial reasons oblige, but it hasn't been affecting me emotionally. Last night she spent the night at his place, and had to sleep alone for the first time in ages. I dreamt it was happening again, woke up sweating and feeling terrible.

I don't know what to do or what to think. She keeps on justifying her actions, and doesn't want to stay with me. I've always had strong thoughts on cheating, being completely against it, but I can't help myself and I can't bring myself to hate her, I don't want us to end. Yet I feel hurt in so many ways, she had a choice, she could have ended it before doing anything (had she told me litterally 1 day before), I don't know what to do

This is my first post

Background:

Six years ago I met the 100% perfect girl. We hooked up 2 days later and had a very intense relationship for 6 weeks before she left for a gap year. We were both young

Six months into the long distance she called it off

We moved in together shortly afterwards, becoming a cub reporter at a well-regarded broadsheet paper. For two years it was great, although I struggled and swallowed down events and stories I was party to and witnessed on the job (we live in an incredibly violent country, and I covered a lot of crime...)

Two years since getting the job, and ended up at an advertising agency. A week before starting the job, I started smoking a lot of weed. I didn't realise it for over a year, but I was incredibly depressed and literally smoked myself away from it all. During this time she tried to help me, desperately, and our codependency reached worse levels. It took a physical and mental toll on her, and the effects were there for everyone to see.

In September last year I found a text message from a guy on her phone, saying my depression had made her do something she wouldn't have done (but I realise today this was only a few months into it, and not nearly as bad as it became).

Two months ago, I called and begged to see her. She agreed, but said she only really wanted to speak in a week after some time. I saw her, already deciding never to touch the drugs again, arranging a therapy session. I saw her and it was painful, I was in shock. She had said she wasn't happy, and that she was worried, I was an emotionally abusing wreck who broke her. 

That Saturday, and told me she wanted to come through to my family's house to be there as a friend, but couldn't talk about us. I was a wreck, faced with having lost her and losing my father, and begged in a way that I never had before.

Over the next three days we had several messy phonecalls where I kept overstepping the line and begging. I then asked for no contact, losing 9kgs, started yoga and a martial art, making new friends and rekindling old ones. I've also tackled my fears and self-doubt, and other intense reasons for not going to see someone despite her begging and my life falling apart over two years. I can process feelings and emotions in a rational, healthy way for the first time in my life.

Last week I met with a very kind, and that it was wrong yet loving for her to stay for so long. The friend put this to her (the ex had actually said that she wasn't going to see me after the month, and possibly only near a year later...). 

Yesterday was my 25th birthday, letting her know that she shouldn't feel obligated, and suggested we meet in a park, possibly grab food afterwards. She replied in a cold manner, saying ""I think that will be fine"" and said she'd rather meet me there than be picked up.

The tone and words upset me greatly

I don't really know what I'm asking for, and that hurt but at least hit home that it's over. This is a shame, as we're highly compatible and would probably be married in a year if I hadn't fallen apart - it was discussed and on the cards. 

TL;DR

Real love, escaping in weed and destructing.
She cheated on me
For the next 6 months
2 months ago, father hits ICU.
Now, and is resentful of me and my actions.

P.S - my father eventually recovered

He dislikes doing most things with the exception of very few activities, one of which is ultimate frisbee which we play together on several teams. Our different views on weekend activities have resulted with him either doing something he dislikes or me being antsy at home watching tv with him. We had a plan that after I graduate this summer I was going to move to his city in my own apartment and live there for the summer so we could spend more than the weekends with one another which would allow us the weekends to each separately do our preferred activities.  

Then I went on an eye opening short study abroad this winter in which I hung out constantly with people who love doing the things I like to do. It was amazing and made me realize how little I was living my life at home. Then upon starting this semester I was offered a few research positions across the country for the summer which obviously would interfere with my previous plans but would probably be spectacular experiences. 

I broke up with my boyfriend the other day because I know that I no longer want to spend my weekends doing nothing and that I will probably take up one of these research opportunities across the country and not be around for him. I am taking 23 credits this semester and have no time for him during the week. 

I know I probably did what was best for me but I can't help but feel so incredibly heartbroken. He did nothing wrong

He says we can the next day. Next day comes and neither of us say anything to each other. Today i get on fb and see that hes been puttin up pics

So after a long day of crying I finally stopped... and asked myself why am I letting him affect(effect?) me like this? Why am I allowing myself to be so miserable? This is HIS loss. I would have been an amazing girlfriend to him.  Would have stayed by his side while he was gone. But nope! His loss. Ill find someone better who I can give my love to. Stay strong all you people out there.

I thought we [24f; 24m] could just keep hanging out like nothing had happened all the while it was killing me inside. I initiated NC 12 days ago and while it was agonising at first I am now starting to feel a little better. I contemplated several times a day breaking it. I contemplated drunk dialling him, the works! I managed to resist and thus preserve my dignity and now I can feel my self confidence starting to creep back. So it DOES get better. Just thought I'd throw in my 2 cents regarding NC.

So I've been using every method at my disposal to talk her into an abortion. Mostly by promising her the world in exchange, since the last post).

So I told her that I'd changed my mind

I said that I was worried about her and the child's health and had set up an appointment with a doctor who does pregnancy health. She's distrustful and scared of doctors but I talked her into it, explaining she was scared and distrustful of doctors, which helped me get what I wanted.

We got there and she didn't say a single word to anyone, along with std tests.

when the doctor did the std tests (and I don't know any of the technical terms) it involved interacting with her vagina. She was not ok with this. I held her hand and whispered soothing nothings. I've never seen someone so uncomfortable before

Anyway we wait for hours

This was yesterday. I have about 100 missed calls from her, but when she started crying I just didn't want to be near her.

 She was not usually one to date people for long.. as she grew bored and annoyed of people easily. Slowly things that I did started to annoy her, for no apparent reason. Yesterday I stayed up all day after working a 12 hr overnight shift to put in her hot water heater.. and she was mad that I stayed up and mad that I didn't put it in the exact way she wanted it. 

She says she doesn't now if she loves me anymore, and shes just plain mean to me half of the time.. but damn I love her, and I still want her. My heart aches all day and all night wanting her, even thought I know id be better off without her. I'd take a bullet for this women, I really would. Even thought she drives me crazy. I don't know what to do. She says she doesn't want to be done with me, but wants to see what else it out there...and it kills. Literally kills me. 

There are alot of things with her that I dont like.. she has no feelings, even to her parents.. she can be rude and crude without warning.., and the sex if every other week. (Long time for me lol)

But I don't know what to do without her. Cant move on.

1373651868.0,1i610u,Pushing 2 months NC so far so good,hotfirethrowaway,13,2,9,"Getting close to 2 months NC and I'm doing okay still. I have had a few sad moments thinking I'll be forever alone. But other than that I have been thinking about him less. 

Posting here time and again has helped me greatly I think.

Last night I really did a purge/cleaning of stuff. While I was cleaning up my room I gathered all the items he's given me and went through them. The cards I have from holidays I read each and every one  of them one last time and then burned them in my fireplace.

Some clothes his parents got me (I have no intention of wearing) put in a black plastic bag and will send them off to goodwill. Not very many items but no need to hold to them.

I'm giving this toy I received to a friend who lives far away so I don't have to look at it anymore. And I'm planning on selling a piece of jewelry and a few more gizmos I have he gave me that I just don't want anymore.

There are a few items I want to keep. I don't associate them with him even though he gave them to me. So I guess me keeping those things are okay.

I realized some of the items I have he gave me

I did have a dream about him the other night. But this time I didn't wake up annoyed or happy or anything. I didn't really care. And I'm okay with that.

I'm going on vacation soon and when I get back I just want to come home and have a fresh state of mind.

1373812725.0,1i9zd7,16/M (me) and 16/F broke up. I don't know what to feel.,BiWinningDude,18,6,8,"Hello

My girlfriend of 8 months and I broke up yesterday. Reasons being she ""wasn't ready for a relationship"". (Please take note of this)

I was pretty unhappy most of the time in that relationship

It wasn't a terrible disaster relationship, but..I never felt like we clicked.
She never wanted to talk to me. In person she was okay

She was friends with a guy who was always all touchy feely
Luckily nothing happened between them (at least i hope not).

When I say we didn't click, and even what i wanted in a relationship i suppose.

Anyways, it kinda sucks but it doesn't. I don't know how to explain it. The part that sucks about it is that now my mind will get all paranoid and think her up with other guys, having more fun than with me. Also that she is probably sighing in relief or something.
The part that doesn't suck is that I am free and can go back out there when time heals me to find a girl that does share my interests. 

She was never quite serious about the relationship

The thing
After months of dating

But I tend not to worry about this. I just feel numb, or be sad and depressed. Yet my mind plays tricks on me. It gives me dreams of us together, then dreams of her cheating on me, then dreams of me going to a psychologist to get help on relationships.

I guess right now my mind is a clusterfuck, why I am being held back and thinking up all these stupid thoughts.

I wake up every morning thinking about you. It's just ridiculous how I pretend every day. 

The problem is that I know you aren't good for me. I'm more negative when I'm around you. I hope you're still going to counseling and talking about things. Because I think if you overcome your problems we can be amazing together. I don't know how long that will take and I really wish I did. 

I sincerely hope you're doing okay. It kills me to think how much I pushed you away and tried convincing myself that I felt differently.
