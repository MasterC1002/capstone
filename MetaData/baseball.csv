We are trying to get the attention of the BBWAA Here is the link: http://goo.gl/PJNNB

Dale Murphy is my Dad. He is the greatest person in the entire world. Besides that, providing a great example for me and other kids that grow up idolizing sports figures. This idea has been not only tainted but lost throughout the steroid era. Were it not for injury prone knees, his career would have been even longer and more successful. I'm posting here (for the first time ever) to raise awareness in this crucial Hall of Fame year. It is the first time that Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Roger Clemens will be on the ballot. That is the hot topic in baseball. Do they deserve a place in the Hall? To quote the Baseball Hall of Fame Website under Rules of Voting:

""5. Voting: Voting shall be based upon the player's record, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.""

It's time to start voting for the right reasons. A combination of respect for the game and skill is what the Hall of Fame claims to be looking for. Yet Dale Murphy has been on the outside looking in for 14 years!

This year is the last year my Dad will be on the ballot. He is too humble to come out and campaign for himself. Discuss

The numbers are there. But THIS IS NOT A POST ABOUT NUMBERS. It's a call to the Baseball Hall of Fame and it's voters to observe the criteria listed to be inducted. Off the field should matter just as much as on the field. If it does not

Dickey is not just a great pitcher -- and he _is_ great, we do Dickey. And he hits about as well as Frenchy does, too. (Oh, and he's lights out on the mound.) It's rare that you have a legit star who respects the game like Crash Davis and appreciates the fact that he's getting millions to play a game any of us would gladly do for a micro-fraction of that. You're getting someone special.

You're also getting someone special in Reyes. Any negative reputation he has is unfounded

We're excited to get d'Arnaud and Syndergaard but it's bittersweet. And

If you're against this deal, the Mets had a top prospect -- BA #9 -- Lastings Milledge. And before 2007, we had BA #22 -- Fernando Martinez. And we also had Aaron Heilman, who had a really solid 2005 out of the pen.

From 2006 to 2008, of course, but with the benefit of hindsight, we realize how big of a mistake it was to not try and turn those three into someone bigger. (And, [ugh](http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2006/10/healey-red-sox.html). [Ugh](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ramirma02.shtml#2007-2008-sum:batting_standard).)

Your window is HUGE right now. HUGE. The AL East is as weak as it's been in recent memory, reeling; the Orioles are the Orioles; and the Rays just sold off or otherwise lost about 10 fWAR. The AL Central, outside the Tigers, doesn't have a 90-win team in it. The West is going to have three good teams, but with the extra Wild Card, you're in great shape. I'm jealous, in fact.

While I hope the Mets make it to October

Have a great 2013

1341935826.0,wbz90,My thoughts as a lifelong Royals fan on what happened to Cano.,the_mattador,630,156,529,"Let me start by saying that I am not trying to justify what happened last night; I only want to offer an explanation. 

So by now everyone is aware that Cano was booed relentlessly last night during his time at the plate and on camera.  What’s more

If you have a minute,” and see which team is forgotten the most.  Now do the same for MLB.  Spoiler alert: It us…In both games.  

You might be saying to yourself, it’s our owner.  He doesn’t care about Kansas City, about baseball, or about winning.  He doesn’t even live in Missouri.  A self-confessed Cardinals fan, Glass is content to sit back and let his holdings turn him a marginal profit while his unqualified son presides over the team.  He not only allowed an All Star outfield to slip away, but also the one bona-fide starting pitcher that we have produced in the last 15 years.  And so, year in and year out

But this year, remodeling our stadium, and planning events.  Needless to say, this week is the biggest event to come to our city in years.  We don’t get to host (or participate in) Olympics, or Superbowls, or World Series, so this is it for us.  This is **the event** for Kansas City for the foreseeable future.  This is evidenced by the fact that we set records for attendance at the ASG 5k and the Futures Game.

And then, Billy Butler, would be hacking homeruns with the best hitters in the game on ESPN in primetime.  Billy Butler, a guy that **we** drafted and developed.  *Our* guy – on the big stage, representing *us*.  Not the Yankees, or Red Sox, or Cardinals, it was Danny Tartabull in 1991.  Robinson Cano was going to end 20+ years of irrelevance

And then, but nothing more than that. I imagine most people felt the same.  But then both talk radio stations in town starting running with the story, and Royals blogs and websites started encouraging people to boo Cano.  I planned on jokingly booing once or twice him myself, betting that most people there would not be aware the situation.  I was very wrong.  The booing started as soon as they put him up on the big screen in batting practice.  It only got worse when he didn’t hit any homeruns.  The booing and cheering for outs grew exponentially with each out that he made.

My theory on the booing is that it happened for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, people were trying to force the talking heads on the broadcast to mention Billy as the explanation; a plan that I am told didn’t work out.  The other was to exercise some anger and frustration.  Midwesterners have been neglected by national sports media for years, and this was our chance to do something to stand out, something worth noting.  People were angry with Cano, but he was more of a scapegoat for deeper reaching issues. 

I apologize for being so long winded. If you think I am totally off-base (no pun intended)

TL;DR – Robbie Cano felt the brunt of Kansas City’s frustration with an absentee owner

1355842944.0,151xop,Most and least favorite teams survey results!,thedeejus,500,72,728,"OK, and I can slice the data any which way.  Here's a couple interesting things to start off:

First of all the top favorite teams were a bit surprising:  Blue Jays led with 11.1%, Padres, Royals, Rockies and Diamondbacks, all bunched up between 1-2%.

[Graph courtesy of timaldinho](http://i.imgur.com/ZniXm.png)

Big surprise - the Yankees were the most hated team with 64.9% of respondents indicating they hated them, making them by far the least-liked team in the majors.  Next were the Red Sox (68% hated or disliked), Phillies (58.4), Cardinals (51.6) and Angels (47.5).

The least-disliked teams were the Mariners and Blue Jays (tied at 9.7% hated or disliked)

To figure out the most popular team (not necessarily the same thing as least hated), what did non-fans of a team think about that team, to avoid undue influence of popular teams?)  The most popular teams were, unsurprisingly, scrappy upstart teams who were good this season after being mediocre the past couple years: Topping the list were the Orioles (M=3.29), followed very closely by the A's (3.28), then the Rays (3.16), Blue Jays (3.12)

Bottoming out that list were the Yankees (M=1.42), Cardinals (2.33) and Marlins (2.40).

The most indifferent teams were the Padres, Royals (71.1%), Rockies (70.7%), Diamondbacks (70.3%) and Indians (68.3%).


Here's a table if you want to copy it into Excel and fiddle with it, but keep in mind it might be skewed by popular teams:

Here's a table summarizing same-city teams' opinions of each other.  Looks like the Bay Area teams are most supportive of each other (Giants fans especially love the A's)

There are lots of other neat things I can do with this data - for example, but only 7.9% hate the Blue Jays; among Red Sox fans, 94.4% hate the Yankees and 4.5% dislike them (i.e., 99% hate or dislike the Yankees, or all but two respondents).  One Red Sox fan ""likes"" the Yankees, and the other one listed the Red Sox and Yankees as their two favorite teams.

If you can think of any other cross-tab analyses like this you're interested in

EDIT:

Behold the gigundo-table.  I hope this works.  Going across is what each team thinks of each other team (using average rating), and who your team hates the most, etc.  You'll probably want to copy this into Excel:
