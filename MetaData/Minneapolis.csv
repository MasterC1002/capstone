1352097359.0,12nn0y,**Important Voting Information**,lilith480,85,19,26,"* **Where do I go to vote?  What will I be voting on?**

Go to [this link](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/Default.aspx) to find out where your polling place is

* **I'm not registered to vote

YES!  Use the link above to find your polling place

a. Photo ID (if your current address is on this ID

b. If address on ID is different from current address, etc) from the **past 30 days**; if you get online bills, just print one out, or bring your laptop/smartphone

* **I just moved/I don't pay any utilities/none of the bills are in my name

Bring someone else with you who lives in your precinct and is registered to vote.  They can vouch for you that you live where you say you do.  If they're not registered but they do have proof of their residency

* **I want to vote but I can't walk/drive to my polling place**

No problem!  You can sign up for a free ride to the polls, they will sign you up for a ride.

***

Now for the personal appeal:

Voting is a very important civic duty, it would personally mean a lot to me if you vote NO on the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment.  Here are some reasons why they matter to me:

**Voter ID**

1. The amendment is written very poorly.  It doesn't account for a lot of unintended consequences.

2. Unlike voter ID measures in almost every other state that has them

3. No other state with voter ID laws has same-day voter registration. Election officials have said that the law

4. Unlike other states

5. The amendment

6. Once it's in the constitution as currently written, we should send it back to the legislature and make them rewrite it, and decide **beforehand** how they plan to enforce the law, so they don't force us to vote on something without first knowing all of the consequences.

**Marriage Amendment**

1. No one would want to be told it's illegal to marry the person they love

2. Gays and lesbians will always be in the minority; therefore, to stand up for and protect their rights

3. No single religion should be held above others and put into law, 5 of the 6 Minnesota Lutheran synods, many Baptists, Episcopalians, Anglicans, Quakers, Unitarians, have same-sex marriage.  We shouldn't be discriminating against those religions.

4. The polls show that the vote is 50-50.  Whether the amendment is defeated will come down to how many people show up on election day. **You could be that 1 vote that makes the difference** (think of Al Franken's election)! How empowering is that???

***

Thank you all!  Please pass on all the information about how to vote to your friends.  This is a really important election and it's really important that you actually go out and vote!  I'm happy to answer any questions about how to vote if anyone is still not sure.

I don't even care to press charges I just need it back.

* Always lock when left unattended:
I can't remember where I read this but apparently the vast majority of bike theft is *opportunistic*. That is, you can't really say that when the bike was expensive, had sentimental value, is your only owned means of transportation, or had all three properties at once.

* Lock both frame and wheels:
A nice u-lock for the frame is basic now, it's a must to lock both wheels. How many bikes have you seen without their front wheel? I've seen many.

* Lock in a visible place: That is

* Don't fucking buy a bike from some dude in a street corner. You know it's stolen.

A really determined thief will always get the bike he wants, but you know no one is going to take it while you sleep. If you must leave it outside, don't use a puny 4-digit combination lock that anyone can pull on. Use a lock you could brain someone with, along with another, lighter one for the front wheel.

If you really care about your bike,False,self,t5_2r3bl,1370911742.0,,,t3_1g31y9

I'm looking to start a team in the Kenwood Park Kickball league.  I played tennis at Kenwood Park a lot last spring and noticed that there were some sweet kickball games going on.  There's gotta be somebody here who is in that league.  I couldn't find much when I googled it.  

EDIT: ding ding! i found my answer!  quoth morganbird: If it's Tuesday or Wednesday night I'm 95% sure it's a pickup game. I sometimes play in a pickup game at Painter Park and sorta know a few people in the Kenwood game. You can probably just go introduce yourself and ask to play with them if you want to.

EDIT 2: The-Cure says:The Painter Park League starts Wed. April 25th, Northeast Park, Bossen, and a few others). If everyone wants to start a team, lets figure out what night would be best. They are all co-ed 18+ Adult League, 10-20 team members (equal ratio of men/women mus be fielded at all times). Fees are $395 for the season. That's 12 regular season games and maybe potential for playoffs. Registration begins in 1 week, Feb 19th. 

EDIT 3:auriolrd says:**Hello! I am a weekly player in the Tuesday night kickball game. It is 100% a pick up game and open to anybody who wants to play. We're very loosely organized but announcements on when in the year we're going to start playing are done via our Facebook group page. PM me your Facebook info and I will invite you to the group!**

I would love some advice and tips!",luminouslylurid,21,44, and I just have so many questions. If any of you want to answer them here or be my official Minneapolis/Minnesota chat buddy that would be great!

Note: I'm sorry if some of my questions seem stupid. I'm from Billings, so just be patient with me. Thanks!

Some of my questions:

I sort of want to leave my car behind in Montana. Is just having a bike a good idea? 

What areas of town should I absolutely avoid?

How many parkas should I bring?

Where are the best places to fish (near town) and where can I learn to ice fish?

What restaurants do you recommend for delicious

What is the sales tax like there? I've never lived in a state with sales tax before. 

What are some fun things to do for those of us who don't turn 21 until October?

Do you guys have an Asian market? If so



That's about all for now. Like I said

Recently accepted into UofM for a masters program.  My girlfriend will be relocating with me.  She works in retail and expects to transfer into the Mall of America.  We have two dogs and two chinchillas.  We currently pay $1500/mo rent but are hoping to decrease this either with a roommate or lower cost of living than where we are now.  I drive and have a car.  She does not and relies purely on walking and public transportation.  The public transportation here is limited to a fairly basic bus network with one hub.  We aren't big drinkers/party scene people so we don't need to be near the bars.  We can get there for the rare times we go out for that.

So, and have grown attached to amenities like a garage (I have a small wood shop), a yard for the dogs, and our own laundry.  I don't mind driving to school (unless public trans is cheaper/easier) but I want to ensure she has the easiest possible commute without multiple bus transfers.

Driving in the Twin Cities - I've only been to Boston and NYC.  A car is mainly a hindrance in both of these cities.  It's almost impossible to park

I know it is really general but what can I expect to be drastically different than living in a city of 43k in New England?

I have noticed several places around here are guarded like a well kept secret! I just want to help others by letting them know about some of these places! Some of them have taken me two years to find!

The Camden Promise Food Shelf is through the Gethsemane Lutheran Church and meets the 1st and 3rd Saturday of each month. The church also hosts Angel Food Ministries so you can order food packages to be picked up there

Pastor Paul's Mission is a great foodshelf they give some bulk items, green peppers, it varies) and have a meal club you can join, not to mention a clothes closet. They are located at 1000 Oliver Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55411

There is also a foodbank from the Salvation Army at 2024 Lyndale Ave. N

Also I want to mention Loaves and Fishes There are several locations throughout the Metro area that serve  meals

Here is a list of more places

http://grovelandfoodshelf.org/

http://www.emergencyfoodshelf.org/

Second Harvest Food Bank, MN 55427, (763) 593-2712

http://shutdownriseup.org/ Is providing meals in the evenings during the goverment shutdown.

There are several Churchs that give out free bread anytime no questions asked

http://www.sharingandcaringhands.org/ also gives out meals daily

I have heard that http://houseofcharity.org/?page_id=75 gives out mid-day meals to all even on weekends which is rare!

There are also 2 places probably more

http://sisterscamelot.org/ is another place to check out.

So this past weekend, and emailed the manager, Amy Olson, explaining what the memorial was and why it was there.  I haven't heard back from anyone.

That was Tuesday morning.  Now, I just got off the phone with my widowed grandmother, Libby, who just called to tell me she drove by the spot and the ghost bike memorial had been taken down.  I'm not sure if it was stolen or cut down by the city, but my hunch is that it was the city.  Is there any way that you folks know of to make a formal complaint, or to officially register this ghost bike with the city?  I've seen some others around that have been there for a while without being taken.

I have a beautiful older, de-clawed, long furred, soft grayish cat named Sydney. He is very laid back and likes to nap a lot. Seeks out attention when he would like some love but he is never pushy or annoying about it. Not a big meow-er, unless you are opening a can of wet food for him and then he is very encouraging. 

I have had this cat since he was a kitten; he is just the most amazing cat and is so important to my family! We are in a bad situation and cannot have him at the hotel with us. My brother was caring for him but is now moving to a place he can’t take Sydney. We literally have until the end of this week (28th of October) to find someone to watch him for us while we try to find an apartment. I hate to have to do this but I am afraid that if I can’t find a temporary home he will end up in a shelter that will put him down because he is old. This would be devastating.

There have been a lot of posts about see X, Y, etc. so I will look those over but are there any specific sites that would be awesome to see around Memorial Day weekend?  We are going for more of an urban exploration vibe rather than a museum tour, as I can do that on my own when I relocate.

So, bed bug infested type places.  My parents traveled cross country and enjoyed Holiday Inn Express but there must be somewhere more interesting to spend $100/night.

Also, and Dives locations but I don't know how cliche that is.  Again, our budget is fairly tight.  As I stated before, I've only been to NYC, Boston, and Baltimore but we are looking for less than $14/plate, if possible, as we are perfectly happy with a good burger

today.  Do you guys really think the transit system is that great?  

The light rail is only useful if you live right on it.  

The buses are unreliable and don't nearly cover enough ground.  Plus they seem to be mostly good for commuting to downtown

Biking is great

It's definitely not a walkable city unless you live downtown.  Especially in the winter.  

Add to this that all transit stops from 1:30 to 4 am right as thousands of people are leaving bars forcing them to get behind the wheel of a car.

I visited pretty much every year when I was growing up but have only been back a handful of times as an adult.

About me: I'm Patrick. I'm 28. I've lived in Oregon all my life. Most of my family that doesn't live in Minneapolis lives in Hawaii. Everyone immediately pegs me as an artist, etc. I'm a struggling independent graphic designer after quitting a soul-sucking job last year.

I bike everywhere. I love to run. I don't like many video games made after 1996 (I love Tetris, tropicalia and bossa nova, dance music from the last decade, and Ethiopian jazz. I don't read much, but I love Bret Easton Ellis and Douglas Coupland and my favorite novel is *The Crying Of Lot 49*. I love cooking and eating, but I think the current food crit craze is really out of hand. I'm in love with jQuery. I have some hipster tendencies. I'm gay and get along well with most gay crowds.

I think most people are too emotional. Lots of people have tried to amateur-diagnose me with Asberger's over the years. I'm a moderate ent. I have really good hair.

1295853863.0,f7xv7,Legal advice needed with intrusive landlord.  (NE Minneapolis),warfrogs,6,0,4,"Hey guys

I know it's late, I really need some help.


Long story short, that was all alright, I could deal with it.

Then the landlord's kid started showing up unannounced, would post things on his door, leave dirty footprints through the house, and generally act somewhat unnerving and obnoxious.

It's gotten way worse over the last 3 weeks.  During all the snow emergencies

He said it was fine but that I had to pay.  Well, in front of one of my employees and said very loudly in front of customers that I owed him rent and have been avoiding his calls, which I haven't as I haven't received a single one as far as I can remember.  I told him to leave or I'd be calling mall security.

I figured the issue was done since my rent should have shown up by now, all of my lights on, and some of my possessions in my closet rifled through along with a note to call the father immediately about further renting.  (Their words, not mine)  I've never met the dad, but our downstairs room-mate has and says he's a reasonable guy and that this sounds more like the son on a power trip, but I'm not really sure.

Now, but as a kid just out of college with student loans, rent, utilities, car payment, and car insurance payment, I don't have a lot of money to consult a lawyer

Does anyone have any ideas as to what I could possibly do?  I'm calling the cops in at 7 in the morning on 311 before work to report trespassing, but I do have deposit records and the like.  Would I be absolutely screwed if I took him to court about this?

What in the world should I do?

**EDIT:  Called 311 this morning and was floored when they said that it wasn't a criminal matter since it's his property, got pushed BACK to my local precinct and filed a report.  The officer said that it was B&amp;E with trespassing but because I'm on a ""oral month to month contract"" that there's not much I can do without ending up on the street.  He said my best bet was to look for another place and once I found it to take legal action against them.  Lesson learned?  Don't bother with 311, call your local precinct.  Hopefully I can get somewhere quick, because I'm still super floored.  I'll check the thread again tomorrow and keep you guys updated with any developments.  (I'll also be calling the ACTUAL landlord tomorrow instead of his son with whom I've had most dealings so that should be interesting.)**",,False,self,True,t3_f7xv7

Thought I'd share this experience
I live in Minneapolis and get internet service of 40 mbps down / 20 mbps up through Century Link. I had a 6 month promotion from when I signed up for the service. During the 6 month promotion I was paying approximately $40 per month for the internet service and modem lease. I do not use or need a home phone line or television subscription so I only had this internet service.

The 6 month promotion period recently expired. When it did

I looked up the prices/promotions for new customers at Century Link and Comcast. New Century Link customers can still receive what looks like the same promotion I had when I started with Century Link. New Comcast customers can get 50 mbps service and a basic TV subscription for $50 per month (for 6 months).

I called Century Link customer service. From the list of automated options, she would have to transfer me to another department if that wasn't satisfactory. I asked to be transferred to the other department.

When another representative picked up

Don't know if this will work for anyone else. But figured I'd offer up my experience in case it can help you avoid overpaying for internet.",self,t5_2r3bl,1376434179.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1kb5x7/how_to_lower_your_internet_bill/

We were told in our closing staff meeting that this would be the last time that happened, I learned that while we DO recycle, the company that handles our recycling isn't able to keep up with the sheer amount of recycling that comes out of the stadium, so they were only going to be collecting our glass recycling. That is only ONE THIRD of the recycling that can be processed from each game. 

Is there something that can be done about this? I'm not really sure how to go about getting this fixed. It is absolutely disgusting to me that with all of the pressure to recycle,False,self,t5_2r3bl,False,,,t3_zq20l

Part of growing up there comes with perks. One is you just kinda know its there
It was about 30 to 40 minutes out of the city

So many people have gone out there and taken advantage of it, car part, computer monitor, grave yard. Everything half destroyed or broken from being used as target practice, and the grounds were covered in gun and rainbow colored rifle shells.

One of the coolest places we found to go shooting.

So my question is directed to some of the long term residents to the area. Is there anywhere in Minnesota that has a similar place to go shooting? Ideally not more than an hour or two away?

If anyone knows of any info
Thanks all!
