1374465477.0,1ishqt,I started making a r/fitmeals cookbook. Looking for some input.,dustinkdkl,209,24,21,"Edit: I appreciate the feedback so far. Keep it coming. Also it came up and I feel it's worth mentioning. I have no intentions of making any sort of money off this. It will 100% free

So I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1io2pp/a_new_rfitmeals_recipe_book/) the other day. A lot of people seemed interested so I figured I'd take a shot at making a r/fitmeals cookbook. 

http://imgur.com/a/6uOne#0


Here are 14 pages I made up to just give a basic outline of the cookbook. Naturally each chapter would be expanded and I'll likely add a Snacks/Misc chapter too. 

My goal is to have it available in pdf and iBooks format so people can put it on their iPads/Tablets/Computers. 


I would like to get some input/constructive criticism. I had a few questions about it myself. 

1. What should be the criteria for a recipe? I've been compiling recipes most by sorting by ""Top - All Time."" Some posts have better pictures/nutritional info/instructions than others. Should I only take the recipes that had quality photos/instructions or just continuing to take most from the Top Voted?     


2. I don't have any sort of design/art experience. If there is a color scheme or formatting tip you want to give I'm all ears 


3. How many recipes total would you want to see in the cookbook?


4. Currently I have it in chapters by meal types. Do you think it would be better to organize the recipes by the post tags? (i.e [Low Cal][Veg] etc) 


I hope you like it

**Ingredients:**

* 3/4 cup flax seed meal
* 1 scoop unflavored whey protein
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/2 tablespoon of Splenda
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup water

**Nutrition:**

Whole crust has 4 grams of effective carbohydrates, 65 grams healthy fats, and 745 calories.

**Preparation:**

* Preheat oven to 425
* Mix dry ingredients together.
* Add wet ingredients

* Spread on pan into a round 12 inch pie
* Bake for 15-17 minutes until cooked through

**Topping Options:**

My only suggested tweak is that, and maybe some onions. I could also see this being good with all sorts of flavor/spice combinations. Oh, and in case there are any other gluten-free folks out there, I used Manini's multipurpose GF flour and it worked really well for the breasts.

[Cauliflower Fried Rice](http://timgetsfit.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/faux-fried-rice1.jpg)

Serves 4

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless
* 1 medium head cauliflower
* 1 Tbsp virgin coconut oil
* 2 large eggs
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small (1/4” piece) of ginger
* 1 large zucchini
* 1 large yellow squash
* ½ medium onion
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 medium carrot
* ½ Tbsp soy sauce
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation**

There are two ways you can ‘rice’ the cauliflower.  I use a food processor and break it into small pieces then pulse until it’s the right size.  If you don’t have a good processor you could also use the large openings on a box grater

Next

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add ½ Tbsp of coconut oil.  Add the sliced chicken to the pan and cook until no pink is visible
aute for about 30 seconds then add the vegetables.  Cook the vegetables to your liking

Microwave the riced cauliflower for 2 minutes.  While that is cooking add the remaining ½ Tbsp of coconut oil to the pan and scramble the eggs.  Add the cauliflower to the scramble egg and chop the egg into it.  Season the cauliflower and rice then add the chicken and vegetables  and combine all ingredients and check seasonings again.  Heat for 1-2 minutes to make sure all ingredients are warm. Serve.

**Tips

* Use any variety of vegetables you’d like:  Water chestnuts and bamboo shoots would be a good addition and you can top this with chopped green onion as well.
* This is mostly Paleo but if you’re 100% hardcore paleo this can be made without the soy sauce and sub coconut aminos. (I haven’t tried the coconut aminos so I add that as a recommendation from others.)
* This can also be made with shrimp
* Sriracha makes this even more awesome.

A few users were posting regular recipes using the [HIGH CAL] tag, cheese burritos, etc. Gaining is important for a lot of us, hence the tag, but there should be something that sets it apart from literally *every other recipe* outside fitmeals (foodporn, allrecipes, etc). It's typically used to describe a calorically dense food that has a great micro- or macro-nutrient profile for health / athletics, veg

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/12nawm/high_protein_100_grams_beef_stew_for_your_winter/) a recent example of the tag used correctly.

Since past submissions are being collated on something we planned to finish ages ago (my fault as well) it's going to be a bit of a pain in the ass to go back and sort through the ordinary recipes that don't belong. Kindly report any links that clearly aren't a *fit* (HAHA)

Ingredients:

&gt;**200g Diced chicken fillets**
&gt;
&gt;**200g Bell Peppers (green/red/yellow/whatever)**
&gt;
&gt;**100g Onion**
&gt;
&gt;**200g Spinach**
&gt;
&gt;**100g Asparagus**
&gt;
&gt;**50g Green beans/snap beans/similar**
&gt;
&gt;**1 clove of garlic, and a dash of worcestershire sauce**

~~                                                            ~~

METHOD:

1. Roast hazelnuts - gas mark 4 (350 F) for 10-15 minutes. Shake the tray/move them around every 3-4 minutes (warning - awesome smell/flavor. be careful not to indulge).

2. Slice asparagus down the middle length-ways and cook on low-moderate heat for 3-4 minutes with a crack of salt and black pepper

3. To your now empty pan, and ginger. Cook until, well u know, goldeny kind of browish. Still on low-moderate heat. Not too hot now.

4. Add your sliced and diced chicken and cook until cooked.

5. Add rest of vegetables and the nuts **except the spinach**. Add the dashes of sauce now too. Maybe add 50g of spinach after a minute or two to promote moisture

6. Doing well, add as much spinach as you can fit in the pan. 150g of spinach is quite a lot you will find out.

7. Cook as much of the spinach down as you can and add the rest.

8. Cook the remaining spinach down as you please. Check the consistency of your peppers and other veg; basically how you want them cooked.

9. I like to leave it on for a few more minutes to let everything sweat a lot. You actually get quite a lot of liquid (sauce almost) which is so delicious.

10. Plate up

~~                                                            ~~

There is no added sauce packets or anything. You will be surprised at the amount of moisture comes out of spinach (I was). All good natural ingredients. Remember to season with black pepper during cooking too.

~~                                                            ~~

* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp PB2
* 1 packet truvia
* Dash of salt
* I threw in a little vanilla. Optional.

* 2 tablespoons fat free cool whip

Mash the banana in a mug or bowl with enough space for this to rise a few inches. Add in the protein powder, salt and baking powder. Add in 1/8 cup of water. If its too dry add more. You want this the consistency of thin cake batter without being runny. 

Microwave on high for 1:00 to 1:15. You will know when it's done because the entire thing will rise and then start to set. Give it 5 more seconds after that and you're good.

Ingredients:

2 Cups Red (Orange) Lentils - You can find these at ethnic stores and some chain grocery stores near the beans or in the ethnic section.

5 Cups Water

1-3 tbs olive oil

1 large yellow onion

3-6 cloves garlic (crushed and diced)

1 inch of ginger root

2-3 tbs Cumin (ground)

1 tbs garam masala (Indian stores will have this)

1-3 tbs red chili powder (depending on the spice level you want)

Salt and Pepper to taste

1 large lemon or about 4 tbs lemon juice


In a pot

While boiling the lentils, add cumin, garam masala, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic.  Cook until garlic browns.  You may need to add more oil and/or water when you add the spices to prevent burning and sticking to the pan.


Add onion mixture to the lentils that have been simmering for 45 minutes.  Let simmer until lentils begin to fall apart (skin separating from bean).  You can add more salt


Now you're ready to eat.  Top off your bowl with some more lemon juice.  The end result should look like a soup, which I prefer to do.  


Cost:  About $5 for the batch (not including if you need to buy spices)

EDIT: Changed Lime to Lemon

I will go ahead and give proper credit to Cooks Illustrated

What you will need:

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

2 medium onions

1 red bell pepper, and cut into 1/2 pieces

6 medium garlic cloves

1/4 cup chili powder

1 tablespoon ground cumin

2 tablespoons ground coriander

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Salt (as needed)

2 pounds 93% lean ground turkey

2 (15 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans

1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes

1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree

Side-note: I hate beans and do not add them to this recipe. 

Now

1) Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until ""shimmering."" [Add onions, chili powder, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, oregano, cayenne, stirring often

2) Increase heat to medium-high. [Stir in 1 pound of ground turkey](http://imgur.com/KMIVh) and cook while breaking up the chunks with a wooden spoon [until no longer pink](http://imgur.com/oB5h1) (about 3 minutes per pound). 

3) [Stir in the beans, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.](http://imgur.com/BTOMl) 

4) Uncover and continue to simmer, [rolled into balls](http://imgur.com/d2CFx), to the chili. [Simmer and cook until chili is slightly thickened \(about 45 minutes to an hour\)](http://imgur.com/2nCeA). [Pro-tip: if the chili begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, stir in 1/2 cup water]

For those wondering why the last pound of ground turkey was rolled into balls prior to adding, like ground beef; otherwise, the turkey will have a stringy appearance.""

[Image here.](http://imgur.com/owCe0) This is a small portion of the total yield- we split it up and I had already eaten most of my share before taking that picture.

Ingredients:

2 pounds flank steak

2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce

2/3 cup soy sauce

1 tablespoon honey

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons onion powder

1 teaspoon liquid smoke

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:

0. Slice meat into thin 1/4 inch strips

1. Combine the ingredients listed above (including meat) in a ziplock bag and refrigerate overnight or for 8-12 hours. 

2. Take meat out of marinade and place in oven at lowest temperature (we used 170F and it turned out perfect

3. That's it. Watch the jerky and start checking up on it after 3 or 4 hours. We kept it in for about 6 hours and it turned out amazing. Pretty tough and chewy


Macros for the [whole recipe](http://imgur.com/HQlk4)

Notes:

- In addition to flank steak, rib eye, top round, eye round, or bottom round. I haven't experimented with any of those (although I plan to), so results may vary.

- For some more marinade ideas

- If you want to go full ketard

- Credit to [Alton Brown for the marinade.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html) That page also has another fan based method for drying the jerky

Ingredients:

* 225g (1 pack) of frozen strawberries

* 2 scoops of protein powder (I used berry flavor)

* Water (or skim milk*) to texture preferences (I used around 100 ml)

Instructions:

Unthaw the frozen strawberries by waiting for 15 minute or so. When they are choppable but still cold chop them up in small cubes and toss them in your mixing bowl. Now put in one scoop of protein powder and get your hand-mixer but dont mix yet. Mush everything together so that when you start mixing it your protein powder doesnt fly all over the place (happened to me on my first try lol). When everything's mixed up add in another scoop and add some water to however you want the texture to be. If you did everything correctly it should be just like ice cream now! You can eat it up now or put it in the freezer for later. My gosh this is so good!

1322664283.0,muqzz,[LOW CAL][CHEAP] A chicken breast with real flavor and the world's best roasted vegetables with Balsamic Glaze.,ButterThatBacon,75,12,17,"Chicken breast.  

Say it.  

Sounds awful, dry, flavorless, gritty always-overcooked chicken breast that tastes more like particle board than meat?  Neither can I.

Well - get ready for this.  I present to you, perfectly cooked and accompanied by some roasted veggies that will make you go 'Whaaaa!'.  We're gonna get a bit cheffy with this one, and it requires some doing on your part - so if you're halfway through a campaign on Skyrim and not trying to make a really nice dinner to impress your significant other - this may not be for you.

Let's begin

Ingredients: (Serves 2)

1 Whole Chicken breast (this is bigger than you think it is - a 'whole' breast is actually two of what folks normally think it is a breast)  It should weigh about a pound total.  I used Bell and Evans chicken from Whole foods

About 1lb of vegetables of your choosing - I used Shallots

1/3 cup table salt (for brine)

1 tbsp sugar (for brine)

tbsp Kosher Salt

tsp Pepper

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

1 tbsp honey

Pam Olive Oil (important if you want to keep calories down!)


Let's begin

Start by putting 1/3 cup table salt and 1 tbsp sugar into a large bowl.  Fill bowl with about a quart of COLD water and use a whisk to dissolve the salt and sugar into the water.  Separate the breast into the two 'lobes' and place them both in the brine for 1 hour.  The brining is super important.  

Preheat the oven to 375.

Once the chicken has brined for 40 minutes, sprinkle kosher salt and crack some pepper on top.  Be gentle, roasting brings out huge amounts of flavor from the veggies and too much salt can make them...well, too salty!  Give them another light spray with the oil and pop them in your oven.  Set the timer for 20 minutes and relax.

Ding!  20 minutes are up...the veggies aren't quite done yet

Remove the chicken from the brine.  This part is important - pat it dry with a paper towel - you definitely don't want any water on the surface of the chicken for the next step.  If the chicken still has water on it when it hits the pan

Spray the surface of a pan with pam - not too much, heat until it's just about smoking.  Place the chicken breasts right into the pan.  When they hit, they should be sizzling hard.  Let it fry there undisturbed for 1 minute and 30 seconds.  I know, sounds like a pain in the ass, but trust me on this one.  

We then take the whole pan and put it in the oven with the veggies.  Set the timer for 5 minutes.  Let the chicken and veggies get to know each other.

Let's make some sauce!  Take the Balsamic Vinegar and honey and put it in a small saucepan (I use a baby egg pan I got at Target for 5 bucks for my sauces) heat it up and it will boil quickly because its so little liquid.  You want some water to boil out of it

DING! Looks like our chicken and veggie timer went off.

Alright

""But wait!  This chicken doesn't quite look done yet!  There's still a little bit of pink in there!""

SHUT YOUR MOUTH!  The chicken is done.  It will continue to cook after it has been removed from the oven, it's a bit lower than the gov't regulation of 165 - but the government isn't exactly known for their tasty chicken, are they?  Fuck those guys.  Trust me on this one.  

So now we're going to rest this chicken like a steak.  This part is also important - we want the chicken to retain its yummy juices

Let's get plating!

I like to start by putting our sauce in the center of the bare place.  The consistency of the sauce will now be slightly syrupy

Next

Now

NOW YOU ARE DONE!  I know, so the recipe/times/temps should work, but as always, YMMV.

I really hope you guys dig it!  I had fun making it and the combination of brining

This entire recipe

ENJOY!

This makes 4 meals.  Divide into Tupperware containers.  You can adjust the amount more or less to make what you want.


You only need:

Tupperware (x4) 

Extra virgin olive oil

1lb Lean ground beef (93% or leaner

Brown Rice (I like boil in bag rice

4 servings of your fat free cheese of choice (I used Kraft fat free 
singles)

Mustard

Ketchup (I only use organic)

Cook up your rice.

Cook up your ground beef in a little bit of olive oil.  (I used a little garlic power and pepper for flavor. This is of course optional.)

Put rice in Tupperware, put some ketchup &amp; mustard in there, and enjoy your cheeseburger satisfying macro.  

I put ketchup &amp; mustard under cheese &amp; beef if I want to throw broccoli in there too to take to work.  

Make it your own

Easy on ketchup and mustard so it doesn't add too much sodium.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This came out awesome

So I set to work and made a few simple changes and knocked out over 40% of the calories vs a traditional recipe and reduced the fat and carb grams.  There was a also a small gain in protein and fiber.  And it is delicious

The tweaks... creamy mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes

**[Healthier Shepherd’s Pie](http://timgetsfit.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shepherds-pie-with-cauliflower.jpg)**

Serves 6

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb lean ground beef (93/7)
* ¼ yellow onion
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* ½ cup beef broth
* 1 Tbsp corn starch
* 1 cup small lima beans (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 cup sweet peas (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 cup sliced carrots (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 medium head cauliflower
* 2 oz low fat cream cheese
* 1 clove garlic
* 2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation**

Spray a heated pan with cooking spray

Stir corn starch into cold beef broth making sure the corn starch is thoroughly mixed into the broth.  Pour the broth slowly into the pan of ground beef and stir continuously until hot.  Once heated it will start to thicken, carrots and peas to the beef mixture and cook until heated.  Add a generous amount of black pepper to the mixture and place on low to keep warm

To make the creamy mashed cauliflower:  Clean and cut the head of cauliflower into small florets.  Cook in salted

Pour beef mixture into a casserole dish and spread into an even layer.  Top with the creamy mashed cauliflower spreading that into an even layer covering all the beef mixture.  You may add additional grated Parmesan

**Tips

* You can use any mix of vegetables you like for this.  If you don’t like lima beans
* Do yourself a favor and get some REAL Parmesan cheese
* The creamy mashed cauliflower makes a great side dish on its own.  Also

I was really impressed with how this turned out.  The bit of cream cheese in the cauliflower really helps to nail the consistency that makes mashed potatoes so damn good.   Since the veggies are mixed in with the meat and sauce mixture they have a ton of flavor as well

Ingredients:

32oz of Canned Whole San Marzano Tomatoes (brand doesn't matter

1 Head of garlic - suit your taste

2 tbsp of chopped basil (I used fresh

2 tbsp Organo (I used fresh

2 tbsp of Red Pepper Flakes (only if you like it spicy)

1 tsp Olive oil

1 tbsp Sugar

1 Chicken Buillon cube (veggie if you must)

2 tbsp tomato paste

S&amp;P to taste.

1 Large spaghetti squash

Direction:
Oven to 400. Slice Spaghetti squash lengthwise

While that's roasting, but food processor or blender works, too.  Pop them in the pot with a bit of S&amp;P, let them simmer for a bit.  

Meanwhile, sugar, bullion cube and tomato paste.  Mix it all up and let it simmer until your squash is done.  If you want it super smooth, put it all in the food processor or blender.

DING! The squash is done.  It should be tender when you touch it with a fork.  Remove it from the oven carefully

Now you're ready to rock.  Put some squash in a bowl

Total for HUGE portion: about 330 calories.  Perfect for killing those pesky pasta cravings

So I decided to use a combination of cottage cheese and greek yogurt instead! It actually turned out FABULOUS. Once it's cooked

Ingredients (I didn't really measure things when I was cooking

~2 1/2 cups of plain low fat Greek yogurt 

~1 cup of low fat cottage cheese 

6 eggs 

~2 cups of white cheddar cheese
could definitely reduce this amount if you want or switch up the kind of cheese.) 

1 10 oz package of spinach 

1 carton of white button mushrooms

1/2 a small onion

1 tbsp olive oil 

1 large or 2 small potatoes

1/2 tsp of salt 

Directions: 

-Heat the oven to 375 degrees F

-Toss the spinach into a large pan and turn on the heat. Let the spinach wilt down until it releases most of its moisture. Set aside. 

-Heat the olive oil and add the onions. Once they turn translucent and just barely start to gain some color

-Dice the potato(s) and add them to a pan of water. Let it cook until the potatoes are just tender. No need to cook them until they're very tender

-Whisk together the cottage cheese, mushrooms, and potatoes. Add most of the cheese, but leave some to sprinkle on top. 

-Pour the mixture into a baking pan and sprinkle the reserved cheese on top. Pop into the oven for around 40 minutes

-Let cool for about 10 minutes, and cold. 

This comes out at around 260 calories per serving :D 

I bet a few cloves of garlic minced and sauteed with the onions and mushrooms would be delicious. We were all out

First dice up all your veg and meat. Toss the meat into a hot wok or frying pan with a tbsp canola oil and cook it until it is brown and cooked through. For tofu drain before cooking and use a firm tofu. Salt and pepper to taste as you go. Set meat aside.

In the same pan cook your veggies and water chestnuts beginning with the onions and carrots if you're using those because browned onions are awesome. Once things start to warm up add your garlic, stir and cook another minute or two. Return meat to the pan and add the hoisin sauce. Stir to coat.

I tend to be extremely busy

What I'm imagining is some sort of recipes that mix beans, seeds, grains, and various fruit/vegetables. I know Quinoa is great.  Warm or cold is fine. I'm just looking for something affordable, filling and quick on the go--preferably something that keeps well (~5 days). The plan is that I'd put them together during the weekend and eat them throughout the week.

Any tips on what works well together? Any spices or additions that improve the experience?

Thanks! Your input is greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR Looking for recipes to make small, and can either be microwaved or eaten cold.**

Edit: I don't have any cooking stuff outside of the basic pots/pants. No george forman, etc.

**Ideas so far:**

* **Southern Quinoa Salad**: Cooked quinoa, whatever), diced onion, black beans, diced tomato, corn, olive oil, salt
* **Mediterranean Quinoa Salad**: quinoa, red onion, bell pepper, olives, garlic, parsley, chives, olive oil. Optional: feta
* **Simple Bean salad**: Kidney Beans, Corn. Olive oil, pinch of cumin. Salt and pepper to taste.
* **Veggie Chili**: Diced tomatoes, chick peas, kidney beans, black beans, onions, jalapeno, chili spice. Optional: mixed cheese (pepper jack, cheddar)
* **Lentil Soup**: Lentils, carrots, zucchini, celery, black pepper, salt, crushed red pepper.
* ** Cucumber Salad**: Chopped cucumber, onion. Salt, pepper, vinegar.
* **Tomato soup**: Crushed tomatoes, onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, basil, pepper. Optional: Crushed red pepper
* **Yogurt Mix**: Greek or Plain yogurt
* **Citrus Cottage Cheese**: Mandarin Oranges and crushed pineapple
* **Tip**: Hardboiled eggs last about a week, just don't eat the yoke. They can also be crumbled and put into salads, sandwiches, anything.",,False,self,1345479674.0,t3_xzzat

2 medium zucchini

5 medium mushrooms
3 eggs
soy sauce to taste
2 tsp butter

That's what I used, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, bell peppers, whatever low cal veggies you like (or better yet, are on sale). 

1) Prepare the freekeh as you would white rice (in a rice cooker or a pan) according to the package instructions. Either set aside or proceed with the other steps while the freekeh is cooking. 

2) Chop all the vegetables and onions and peppers fairly finely (to about 1/3 inch cubes). I don't remove the seeds and ribs of the jalapenos before chopping but that's because we like it really spicy. 

2) Melt 1 tsp butter in a pan and then add all the chopped veggies at once. Stir constantly over medium-high or high heat

3) Fry eggs in 1 tsp butter. Finely chop.

4) Dump the freekeh into a bowl. Add the cooked veggies

+1 cup low fat cottage cheese (I personally use Lyncott brand but whatever is okay)

+4 eggs

+A teaspoon of vanilla extract

+2 Spoonfuls of low fat peanut butter (I generally use creamy

+2 spoonfuls of hersheys cocoa powder



**Preparation:**

Basically put everything in the blender and blend it like there's no tomorrow. I found out that this recipe makes the mix thicker than the original one

Once you get the pancake batter just put it in the pan and cook to your preference. One tip here is that since I usually get the batter really thick i use a spoon to better distribute it around the pan and actually get a round pancake shape.

That's it

Ingredients
(serves 4

* 150g oats (I used rolled)

* 4 eggs (you could probably get away with 3)

That's it!

I also added:

* 1 tsp cinnamon

* 1/4 tsp stevia (but I'd leave that out next time)

Method:

Cook like normal pancakes but if you don't know how to do that

1. Heat a non-stick pan on a medium high heat - you want it high enough to cook 'em fast so they keep their shape (get solid fast) but not so high that they burn. (If you don't have a non-stick pan

2. Pour on the batter letting it spread until you have the size you want.

3. Wait for a bit until it look reasonably solid (about 2 mins)

4. Turn it over and wait til you reckon it's done.

Next

Add the spices and the meat. Cook

1. Roast your beets: Preheat oven to 400F. Wash beets and cut off the greens (save for later, place on baking sheet, and bake for about an hour. Halfway through, flip the beets. Bake time will depend on the size of your beets; they are done when a fork slides easily to the center. 

2. After beets have cooled, so bake a bunch in batches!

3. In a heated frypan or sautee pan

4. Cut your beets into large cubes about 3/4 in to an inch thick. 

5. Toss your beets and arugula together. Crumble feta on top

Lean ground beef (I used 90% lean) 1 lb raw

3 cans of diced tomatoes

1 Green bell pepper

1 sweet onion

Chili Powder

Directions

You need a large pot (I use I believe a 8 quart deal)

Pour diced Tomatoes into large pot (save one can for grease if needed). You do not have to put them in first

Brown Meats and place in large pot once done

Dice onion and pepper while meat is browning to save time. Produce about a 1/2-3/4 cup of each depending on your preferences and add to pot.

Once all meat and veggies are added

Turn on med-low heat and bring to simmer

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Ok so this usually takes me about an hour to make, but if you only have smaller pots and pans you can always halve the recipe. Anyway

TL;DR: READ IT. I SPENT LIKE AN HOUR WRITING THIS UP. IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY IN THE LONG RUN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BULK ON A BUDGET.


Ingredients:

2 lbs. dried lentils

2 cups + 4 tablespoons of olive oil *(about 17 oz. or 500 ml. they sell bottles of this size at my grocery store for $5)*

1 cup red wine vinegar

3-5 tbs. ground Cumin

3-5 tbs. Chili powder

2-3 teaspoons garlic powder *(for all the spices, but obviously unless you want to be eating garlic for a week, you'll have left over garlic)*

2 large onions

2.5 lbs. boneless

Directions:

1. Cook the lentils in a large sauce pan. Basically, but it's highly variable so check them every now and then to see if they're tender. Once they're tender drain them using a large colander. I usually need to use two colanders at this step because it's just so many goddamned lentils, but I'm sure a more clever man could figure out a way to do it with just 1 colander. Anyway, after they're drained dump them back in the sauce pan.

2. While the lentils are cooking you can chop up your onions and chicken. If you got frozen chicken make sure it's thawed first (easier to cut) and then cut it into small pieces &lt; 1 inch square.

3. In a large frying pan

4. Add the chicken to the browned onions and cook for about 5 - 10 mins, stirring occasionally. *(This should take 15 - 20 minutes depending on how large or small you cut the chicken, but you'll have a good idea it's getting done when you don't see any pink and the chicken starts to take on a firmer texture. Obviously you can also cut open some pieces to make sure.)*

5. Now take your remaining cumin and chili powder along with the 2 teaspoons of garlic powder

Since I live in NC, and is probably not low-carb. I recommend [Scott's Barbeque](http://www.scottsbarbecuesauce.com/)


I've been making this for a couple of months, but whatever.


This is ridiculously simple. What you'll need is as follows:

* A Crock Pot (perhaps some olive oil)

* Beef Chuck Roast

* Vinegar-based Barbeque Sauce

Start by rubbing some olive oil on the inside of the crock pot to keep the roast from sticking to sides of the crock pot. I've skipped this step before without problems


Place the roast in the bottom of the crock pot and pour on half of the bottle of sauce. Turn the pot on low


Drain the juices out of the crock pot. The roast should be tender enough at this point that you can separate it with a fork. Take two forks and break the roast apart. Place the separated beef back into the crock pot and pour on the remaining half of the sauce. Stir it around a bit and let it cook on low for another hour. That's it. 


I usually refrigerate the extra barbeque and microwave it when I need it. Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/agWz4.jpg) of it on a sandwich.


I don't have a caloric breakdown for you, and most vinegar-based sauces have negligible carbs.

**Prep Time**

10-15 min (easy)

**Ingredients**

- Marinated steak tips
- Kale
- Collard greens
- Spinach
- Olive oil
- Salt

*Cost:* This varies greatly depending on the quality of the ingredients. Leafy greens are most susceptible to pesticide deterioration, a butchery, organic, grass-fed...the list goes on. So I can't really put a price on it, but I can almost guarantee it will be less than a steak salad you order at a restaurant.

**Directions**

Throw the steak tips on the George Foreman. Depending on how rare you like your steak

While meat is cooking, add in the spinach - it should only take a minute or two to reduce.

Right about now the meat should be done as well

**Ingredients**:  
3 lbs stew meat (the more fat
4 cloves garlic
1 onion
1 lb rutabaga
1 lb turnip
1 lb celery
1 lb carrots
.25 lb mushrooms  
1 bottle of red wine (merlot works best)  
1/4 cup butter  
Beef bouillon (cubes or paste)

**Directions**:
Chop the vegetables first; this can take a while. Pour yourself some wine, add the garlic and onions. Pour the wine into a big stockpot with the beef bouillon and turn it to high. When the onions and garlic have reduced and the beef is browned all over, add it to the (now hot) wine. Bring to a boil and then turn down to simmer. Add butter and mushrooms.

After 30 minutes, then let simmer. Keep it simmering for as long as you can stand it (it just keeps getting better!), and then eat.

This is about 7 pounds of food

Right now what I've been eating is:
breakfast: eggs with goat cheese, and for carbs I'll mix in some flour (gives it more of a pancake-y texture the more you add)

lunch: grilled chicken breasts with cheddar cheese, broccoli, and whole-grain toast if I'm having carbs

dinner: super lean ground turkey, sour cream, red/green pepper mixed with zucchini, garden salsa, and brown rice if I'm having carbs

You need:

* Blender
* Med-Lrg Bowl
* Spoon
* Spatual
* Non-stick pan
* Cooking Spray (butter if you like)
* 1 cup Old Fashioned Oats.  I used the quaker ones in the cardboard cylindric container. Real Cheap.
* 2 scoops protein powder (heaping scoops if you choose protein over exactness).  This is where the macros vary.  Mine is 20 grams/scoop.
* 1 cup cottage cheese.  I used 1% milkfat Publix brand.  On Sale.
* 1 cup Egg Whites.  Pick a container in the egg section. $2-5 and you'll have some left over.

It puts the oats and protein powder (dry ingredients) in the bowl.  It mixes them.  It puts the mixture in the blender.  It blends them until they are combined (it will see lil specks of oatmeal).  It dumps them back in the bowl.

Put the cottage cheese into the blender and blend until smooth.  Then add the egg whites, but not frothy. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture while stirring.  Stir until combined.  If it seems really thick, add some milk.  The mixture will thicken as it waits to be cooked, so keep some milk handy to add as this happens.  Try to keep a similar consistency throughout, just cause.  I only added milk once.

Heat the non-stick pan to med/med-high (6-7 on my stove).  Coat with cooking spray or butter. Cook like they were pancakes.  Mine were 4-5 inches across.  Made 8.

(For those that don't know how to cook pancakes.  Pour into a pan, these cakes don' run... too much.  Don't touch them until the edges look rounded off and you see bubbles or tiny holes form all across the pancake. Think 10 holes, not 2.  Flip and cook for another minute or two.  Flipped side doesn't take too long. Easy.)

They are pah-retty heavy.  I ate two

The important stuff...

**AS A BATCH**  The macros read as 8g fat/64g carbs/215g protein at about 1200 cals.  So just divide by how many cakes you make.  These are good for cutting.  Using butter instead of spray

Side note:  They are a little bland as made above.  I added a pinch of salt and it helped a bit.

When I make them again I will take some process pics if I remember.

Have Fun!

Grilled Pork chops: 150g, 0g carbs, 7g fat  

  
  
  

Pretty easy to prepare.  



1) Put the pasta in boiling water (10 mins).

2) Meanwhile

3) Stick the pork on the grill (I use a george foreman).

4) When the pasta has been on for 6 mins (ie 4 mins before it's finished cooking) throw your chopped carrot and peas in the water with the pasta.

5) Once the pasta, drain them off.

6) Chop up your pork steak (should be cooked by now) into small chunks, and carrots.

7) Add pesto and mayo to the bowl and then mix the FUCK outta that bad boy. You're about to devour 1.5k worth of calories

8) Sprinkle your pumpkin and sunflower seeds on top

  
  
  

What I like about this recipe is you can tweak it to your needs pretty easily. Less fat? Forget the mayo. More protein? Add some more pork! Or turkey! Or whatever! It works with most meats. And most of the fat in there is mono or poly-unsaturated as well. It's great!  


So I hope you enjoy it and good luck with your gains!

1348068130.0,1050q7,[Recipe]How I eat cheap/healthy/adventurous every week [paleo][keto],funkyskunk,34,5,4,"I've been doing this for a year now. It is a blanket recipe that can be fucked around with to fit your dietary needs.

Basically

Get them from your local indian/ethnic store for about 1.50-2.00 each. They are spice pouches for different indian dishes. I usually ignore the directions on the back and make it how I want (the pouch recipes usually just add yogurt and paneer, etc.).

My go to recipe:

1) Cube about 3 lbs of chicken and 3 lbs of pork

2) Cut up some onions

3) Take my big ass cast iron pan and throw in a few healthy spoonfuls of coconut oil. Put on medium-high (like a 7 out of 10).

4) Throw in the veggies and let them cook a few minutes (not too much

5) Throw in the meat. Continually stir so that the outside of all the meat gets a bit cooked (but the inside will still be raw)

6) Throw in the spice packet. Continue stirring since the cast iron is hot as fuck and I don't want the spices to burn to the pan.

7) Throw in a can of coconut milk (ie. nectar of the gods)

8) Stir everything around until mixed together nicely. Sometimes it is necessary to add a bit more water to cover everything. You want it to look like a nice stew.

9) Put on low heat and let it simmer until meat is done and veggies are tender. If it gets hot enough that it starts bubbling turn it down low. If it gets too hot the coconut milk starts to break up and thins out

Optional: Throw in some plain greek yogurt to thicken out and give a tasty texture. Just make sure it doesn't get too hot or the yogurt breaks up as well. Just think low and slow.

10) Eattttttt. As a reference

I get three meals out of the above. The other plus side is it is really easy to add more calories to if you need it. Just throw in a few eggs over easy

Each packet is a different flavor so you won't get tired of it (also changing up the veggies and meat with whatever is in season/cheap). Seriously

Happy eating.",self,t5_2sd23,1348069039.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1050q7/recipehow_i_eat_cheaphealthyadventurous_every/

**Bad Points**

**Props to [this blog](http://fedandfit.com/2012/02/24/paleo-chili-relleno/) for the tomato sauce recipe**

**Two Bean Beef and Quinoa Chili (~8 servings)**

**Ingredients**

* Can of black beans

* Can of red kidney beans

* 1 lb ground beef

* Package quinoa

* 2 1/2 cups Campbell's No Salt Added

* 1 cup chopped onions

* whole bulb of garlic

* 2 stalks of celery

* 1 container of whole white mushrooms

* 1 carrot

* 3 large tomatoes

* 2 tablespoon cumin

* 1 tablespoon chili powder

* 2 tablespoons dried oregano

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt

* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon


**Method**

1. Saute half of the onion and half the garlic in a little olive oil on medium-high heat. 

2. When lightly browned

3. Let saute for 2-3 minutes

4. Transfer to a bowl and use an immersion blender to puree or transfer to stand blender and puree. Set aside.

5. As you're preparing the sauce

6. Return burner to medium-high heat. In the same pan, carrots and celery. Let saute for 3 minutes, stir if you notice things burning.

7. Add the beef

8. Add the sauce you created in steps 1-4 back to the pan with the beans

9. Lastly

**Suggestions**

You can serve the chili on top of the quinoa or just mix it straight in somewhere between steps 8-9.

Add any vegetables you see fit.

Transfer everything to a larger pot/pan after step 7 if the rest of the ingredients won't fit.

**[Nutritional Information (Courtesy of Calorie Count's Recipe Analyzer)](http://i.imgur.com/8eujR.jpg)**. This is just an approximation that is highly dependent on what veggies you put in and the method you chose to cook the quinoa.

*This is what the original recipe says but I just used a casserole dish that I greased up with butter. I didn't include the butter in the calorie count as it was so small of an amount.

1327548712.0,ox32i,[Quick][Veg][Cheap] Treat of Spicy Tomato Soup with cheese.,MockDeath,29,3,3,"Today I was craving tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I really didn't want the extra calories from the bread since I have been kicking ass with the diet/exercise thing and I felt amazingly lazy at the same time so didn't want to saute onions and the like.  So I came up with this soup as a treat and it was so tasty I had to share.  I apologize for the fact I never measure my seasoning.

**Equipment**

1 Pan

1 Spatula/turner

Blender or immersion blender



**Ingredients**

1 Can stewed tomatoes *about* 122 cal

½ cup 1% milk *about* 55 cal

1½ ounces of shredded cheese *about* 165 cal

1TBS olive oil *about* 120 cal

*Spice to taste with:*

Crushed red peppers

Garlic powder

Onion powder

Pepper

Oregano

Parsley

Sage

Rosemary

Thyme


Drain tomatoes and reserve liquid.  Heat the pan with the olive oil.  When the pan is hot pour in the tomatoes(Careful they can splatter badly).  Cook the tomatoes till they begin to fall apart, make sure to stir occasional to avoid burning.  Add milk and blend soup until uniform consistency.  Remove from heat and stir the cheese in till it melts.  If cheese does not melt return to heat until melting is complete.  Pour into bowl and place spoon in hand.  Scoop the soup up with spoon and place in mouth, be sure to swallow.

The soup was beyond tasty and rather filling at only a rough 460 calories.  It isn't the healthiest soup on the planet,False,self,t5_2sd23,True,,,t3_ox32i
