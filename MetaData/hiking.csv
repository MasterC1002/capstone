The Forest Service may only charge a fee for use of sites that contain all of the following amenities: permanent toilet; permanent trash receptacle; developed parking; interpretive sign or kiosk; picnic table; and security services. But, FS has no authority to charge you for parking there. The court rejected Forest Service's argument that it could charge a fee simply for making the amenities available, stating that the law ""clearly contemplates that individuals can go to a place offering facilities and services without using the facilities and services and without paying a fee.""  The court also rejected Forest Service's argument that it could charge a fee for picnicking in undeveloped areas that are ""in the vicinity"" of developed sites.

The case involved fees charged on the Coronado National Forest in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Idaho &amp; Montana.  So, if all you're doing is parking at a trailhead, toss anything in the trash can

We said hello and we chatted for a bit, my wife had and still has no clue that he was there) he then turned away and got into his car and drove off. I felt very unnerved by him for some reason and I've hiked a lot of places far more remote and ran into all kinds of characters but never quite had a feeling like that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt

Probably taking an Aunt/cousin there to keep us company.

I'm looking to do the 1 day hike to MP.   If I understand correctly

- Do I need permission for the one day hike?   I've been reading I need to pay a fee for the 4 day Inca Trail

- If I was by myself, I want something more respectable, does anybody knows of places in Aguas Calientes? (online I find mostly Hostels)

- How long do I have to be in Cusco/Aguas Calientes to acclimate to altitude?  Specially since I want to hike?   I'm usually a hiker in the US (New Hampshire

- Any ideas on the plane to Cusco and train to Aguas Calientes?   This wont' be a proper hiking trip

- If I see Macchu Picchu on Monday morning can I make it to Cusco and fly back to Lima on that Monday or wait til Tuesday?   Stay in Aguas Calientes that night or can I make it back to Cusco?

I tried asking /r/travel

Thanks.

There were two relatively large groups on the mountain that day

On my way up I came across a group of four kids, and one girl was freaking out. Her friends seemed to have a handle on her so I moved along. 

This next one is what absolutely blew my mind. I was getting towards where the steep part of the White Dot is easing up, how much longer, etc. Turns out this kid was with a scout troop. I was never in the Boy Scouts or anything by my head nearly exploded. A scout leader just left this poor kid behind by himself? This might be the military in me coming out, but something done as a group should be done as a group. If one person in your party is having a tough time, you slow down for them or turn around and go back. You certainly don't leave them all by themselves, especially a young kid! I ended up passing the troop leader on my way up as he was making his way down, and I'll tell you I was very

The great thing about this insurance is 1. It's only $45 (for CALSTAR) 2. Many care flight services honor other services insurance.

Purchasing this insurance will cover you in many regions accross many service providers. $45 (Roughly $80 for a family package) is a very small price to pay and even if you don't use it

1. [Morton's toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe)
This is a foot shape characterized by a shortened first metatarsal, which can make a hike a dozen times more comfortable.  The laces on the ankle also help to hold your heel in the back of the boot, which stops your short toe from banging the front (this can cause long-term health problems).  The only real plusses to this foot shape are prehensile toes and knowing that the ancient Greeks thought you had pretty feet.

2. [Morton's Neruoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_neuroma)
This is a much more troublesome condition.  Insofar as I understand it, but much stronger, going from your toe up through your ankle).  They only way to prevent symptoms is by wearing the right shoes.  For women, no heels, only flats.  For men, this means wearing shoes that fit in the right dimensions (different people are vulnerable to different kinds of compression).  The fit needs to walk a very, very fine line between loose enough to fit well, a shoe needs to be wide around my toes.  Most shoes that fit me aren't made that way, my boots are really only secured at one point

3. The last, fine.  That just means they'll be picking up a little more weight.  I get used to it every winter when I have to break out a pair of boots that weigh 700 grams each (for my fellow Americans, that's about a pound and a half).  After that, a boot that weighs a third as much is nothing.

**TL;DR stop complaining about other people wearing boots.  They're not ""the cancer that's killing hiking.""**",,t5_2r9om,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/v9m41/three_good_reasons_to_stop_complaining_about/

This is a slightly lengthy read

Basically, and in less than 3 weeks, I'm about to embark on a one week (120 kilometers) hike on Western Australia's famous ""Bibbulmun Track"".  I HAVE been preparing, as much as I can with my day job, done a few 10 - 12k hikes with minimal inconvenience, so I am fairly confident I can tackle the distances involved on a day to day basis on the Bib. 

What I really need advice on is a few more practical measures. 

Most notably : FOOD. 

First of all, along with a pan to cook things on (who knows, I might catch a rabbit or a fish), and that's about it. 

This will be my first time hiking for seven days

I plan to take with me : Dehydrated food packets for dinner (a well known New Zealand camp food brand that are extremely well balanced meals with around 1500kjs of energy per pack), and then a few sticks of salami to chew on throughout for salt/fat, a jar of honey for natural sugars, and trail mix to chew on as I walk. 

My general question to this subreddit is kind of twofold : What am I missing, and nutritionally too hard to look past for a hiker on a seven day, 120km walk? 

I look forward to hearing your hiking nutrition/good food ideas. ",,t5_2r9om,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1f2x14/call_for_general_nutrition_advice_for_an_120km/

I haven't gone camping in a long time - usually just day hikes, some of which weren't even active.  The park websites are not easy to understand or navigate, and 2 out of 3 rangers I spoke too acted like pricks.

1343731659.0,xfyyu,Putting the slowest walker first.,great_scotty,23,8,39,"Hi Hiking

Putting the slowest first

I was talking to someone about always putting the slowest memer of the party first this week and I realised I wasn't articulating myself terribly well so I thought I'd write it down instead. When I was doing walking holidays with cadets it was always emphasised that the slowest member of the party gets put at the front. I've been away with others quite a lot and having experienced being both the strongest and weakest member of the group

The main reason given is safety, fatigue, urgent call of nature etc, then those out at the front won't necessarily see or hear about it if there is even a modest gap(with cycling that is even more difficult). Unless you're proactively looking behind you to check, it could be several minutes before anyone realises someone is having issues which is easily enough time for them to be out of sight, at which point people will wait a fair amount of time before retracing steps. If someone needs help, that delay could be harmful.

Navigation is obviously important, there isn't really any way of knowing if you're on the wrong path or not. How far will the less experienced members continue on an incorrect path without seeing the rest of the group before turning back?

It could be argued that as long as the party stays tightly together, hungry, cold or miserable. It may be manageable for short periods but I know from personal experience that it is draining. Placing the slowest at the front and fastest at the back naturally causes the group to stay tightly together, the bigger the difference between fastest and slowest, the better it works.

Aside from safety

If the stronger members of the group go off ahead of the weaker members

The whole group will make better progress and get there quicker if the slowest member is at the front. Each time the group sets off as a whole

When out walking and cycling, it lets them assess a situation first, figure out when you are, look for paths themselves and take a bearing. You don't gain those skills by someone explaining to you what they've just done, you get them by doing it yourself and THEN explaining it back to the more experienced member to check if you're unsure. If you have a struggling member of the party arrive at a decision point after the stronger members. All the interesting work has usually been done and a decision taken, aside from them missing opportunities to build those skills, it's pretty dis-empowering.

Being the most experienced in the group means that there is plenty of advice and support you can give to others. Walking behind less experienced members gives you the opportunity to see what they are doing and how their equipment is performing and be able to advise and guide. In addition, they are far more preventable.

Morale plays a huge part in someone's ability to keep going when they're tired, and they're not going to want to go and do things with you again. The strongest members are far less sensitive to it so they are in the best position to make sure it is kept up for others. There are a few things about putting the slowest first that affect morale.

I have seen first had that taking someone who is straggling at the back and putting them up at the front gives them a massive boost in morale and they are much better able to keep it up. It can get pretty depressing seeing the people you are with have to constantly all stop and wait for YOU. It's not difficult for whomever is at the back to start to feel like they are holding everyone back and shouldn't be there

You can often tell who is struggling by who goes quiet, unless they turn around, can only be heard by those immediately behind them. If you're breathing hard trying to keep up with the group and they are up ahead laughing and joking and enjoying themselves, then even if the group does stays together, you can't hear them. If the strongest members are at the back laughing and joking, then everyone can hear and at least be included, even if they can't always contribute. Some of the most memorable jokes of walking holidays have been when out walking. I would hate to think that some of the group could have been isolated from social side of walking because they happened to be at the back.

I only point these things out because I've made nearly all of these mistakes at various points in the past. If I'd read something like this earlier then I would have been less likely to make them.

I first started writing this app for windows mobile to use for my own hiking trips but have since got an android phone so I decided to port it over and make it better.

Basically it is a GPS recording application.  It will record your hikes and create a google map for you to share.  Here are some more features:

-Compass with waypoints (to help you find your car or something if you get lost)
-Altitude graph
-Placemarkers
-Speed
-Multiple trails per hike

Here is a link to the trial version:

The restrictions on the free version are:

-Can only save 3 trips
-Can only save 3 waypoints
-Can't share trips (since it uploads files to my server)

If you guys download the lite version and like it.  Just send me a message and I will send you a link to the full version for free.  I wish I could put a coupon on the paid version but the android market doesn't let me.

This weekend, and it was being used as my GPS navigation to get back to my car. It was 100% charged when I left, but only lasted about 3 to 4 hours in the cold.

Well, and ended up around 15 to 20 miles away from my car in the wrong direction. Long story short: I lucked out and a sheriff found me as I was building a shelter on the side of the road to stay the night in the snowstorm. The shelter I was making probably wouldn't have been enough. I was an idiot and didn't pack in a map and compass.

EDIT: [Blog post about my hiking adventure](http://jeffstagg.com/hike-camp/mount-elbert/)

I need a GPS that will last through the cold. Now, but I can't find anywhere that says if I can export my Garmin-tracked trails to Google maps. Does anyone know if this is possible, or if there is a GPS that would allow me to do this that is more accurate and more durable than my Droid?
