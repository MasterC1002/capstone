Trajan was the first since Augustus to expand the borders of Rome (Dacia and the East). Big time expansionist.

Hadrian, as well as fortifications along the Rhine and Euphrates.

My question is

I've always been curious about this

As for other explanations, since he just ignored it* and continued travelling and building merrily.

*""On coming to Rome he cancelled the debts that were owing to the imperial treasury and to the public treasury of the Romans""

I intend on making 3 -4 seasons of an animated series I will call Raging Romans, and a clarification of elements in the Roman army that caused alot of confusion. There will be 4 episodes per month. A 20 minute Main episode, a 3 minute ‘quick’ episode, a DIY and a ‘clarifications’ episode a few minutes long which will be feedback and corrections to whatever I have presented incorrectly 
In the early days of my Roman obsession I used to get angry (seriously) that one movie called their soldiers Roman and had chain mail and yellow round helmets, the now obvious difference between a late republican legionary in montefortino helmet verses a lorica segmentata clad Dacian war veteran were lost, only because most websites said there was a 'gap' but never showed this visually.
I want to explore the lesser known elements of the roman Panopy, or enough knowledge and direction to look for more.
We will also be doing DIY episodes for tunic making
At the moment I have multiple questions
- Why did the Roman Shield Change
- Did soldiers really wear crests
-what colour is my tunic
-Ode to the Montefortino (these will be episodes dedicated to one item)


TLDR - If you have ANY question about Rome, please ask here and we'll consider it for an episode and answer what we can now.

The ruling class and the Senate in Rome at the time was utterly spineless, over time, Rome could hope to return to it's moral strength before the Punic Wars. The influx of wealth after conquering Carthage had corrupted the Roman elite, made them fat and weak, and Caesar had hoped to rectify this.

No era of Roman history is as complexly misinterpreted as during the fifteen years when Nero ruled from the Imperial palace. And, one man's villainy would eclipse the prosperity of his reign, and Nero's end would bring about a legend more enduring than such an ineffectual leader was ever worth. Yet, the reaction to Nero’s suicide in 68 AD from the Roman world reflected a much different person from the megalomaniac monster commonly depicted in the darker passages of Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio.  Lord Acton , a contemporary moralist and historian remarked that “power tends to corrupt, it fails to truly resemble his reign from his inaugural address, and the various programs instituted under his reign that inevitably ended the line of conquering Caesars and began the road to Rome's fall as a world power. 

And I would like to convey the thesis that he started out as a good ruler
