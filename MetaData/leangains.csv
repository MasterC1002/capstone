**Stats:**
23 year old, never measured BF% accurately

**Routine:**
I started SL 5x5 in March and have pretty much continued with that up until now 3x a week. Though recently I have been incorporating some Madcow in to help break through my squat plateau. I do a good amount of accessory work as well like weighted hanging leg raises, planks, etc. I also usually run a 5k or do tabata sprints 2x a week. Aaaand I'm heavily addicted to rock climbing.


**Lift stats progress since March:**

Squat 65lbs -&gt; 150lbs 5RM

Deadlift 45lbs -&gt; 195lbs 5RM

Bench 45lbs -&gt; 100lbs 5RM

And I can do like 5 pull-ups in a row ha..woo.


**Diet:** I did keto from October 2012 to early May 2013. It was cool, so there's that. This week I've been super strict to &lt;1400 calories and it's helped me get definition and drop 2.5 lbs. I find that calories matter more for my progress than macro cycle, but I still do cycle fats and carbs on rest/workout days.

Here are a couple pictures from my journey:

First

Though this is my first post in r/leangains (and on reddit)

I've been on a -20/+20 recomp since July and only recently switched to a -20/+30 bulk

Some things I find to be noteworthy:

-I counted calories pretty meticulously for a few weeks or so when I started

-I kept protein to about .82 g/lb bodyweight. I replaced the missing protein (according to ifcalc) with carbs.

-I didn't really worry about macros that much; I made sure I was eating enough protein and then just focused on eating a lot more carbs on workout days and a lot more fats on rest days. I didn't worry about hitting 300g carbs/70g fat/etc (though I was pretty close to those targets on most days)

-I eat 2 meals a day on most days

-I have a sweet tooth and eat a lot of snacks - cookies, CHEESECAKE, etc.

-I made sure I ate a lot of vegetables and drank a lot of water every day (~128 oz). I recently started eating more fruits

-Workout routine: 

 Tuesday - Squat (RPT), BW Chinups)

 Thursday - Bench (RPT)

 Saturday - Deadlift (RPT)

 I recently started doing 10 minute cardio sessions on Sundays (for health

 All RPT exercises are done for 5

-Staple foods: naan, spinach, pomegranate seeds, cereal/milk, QUEST BARS (best snack), nonfat ham, low-calorie bagel thins/tortillas

-I drink green/black tea every morning. I don't take any other supplements (I need to start taking some vitamin d3

-I usually get around 7 hours of sleep/night (at least 6).

-I've probably had about 1 cheat meal every two weeks on average

1360243062.0,1829tw,What I have learned doing leangains,kikapu,123,20,56,"1.	IF/leagains is easy.  After the first week the hunger of not eating breakfast isn’t an issue.  No more 6 small meals a day and you can eat large satisfying meals and still lose weight!

2.	Keep a record of your progress!! Take photos,3,6,9 months you will be amazed at the boost it gives you to see how far you have come!  Wish I had done this more!

3.	Low fat on training days. I thought this meant as low as possible

4.	Low carb on rest days.  Much like low fat on training days

5.	You don’t need lots of fancy exercises, chest press, pull/chin ups &amp; overhead press will do pretty much everything you need.

6.	Black coffee is amazing.

7.	Green tea doesn’t  taste too bad.

8.	If you are making progress be that losing weight

9.	You don’t need to get all your carbs from whole/low GI foods.  Mix it up

10.	If you are going out for a meal don’t fret it just enjoy the meal and get back on it the next day.

11.    Listen to your body! If you need to miss a day then its fine! All your progress or muscle wont be lost but if you push your body too far you may need to miss more than just the one sessions.

12.  Protein is important but you need to be sensible if you have too high a protein intake you restrict your carbs and fat intake both of which are also important see 3 &amp; 4.

Am sure there are lots more thing but these are things that spring to mind!  Now just wish I followed the above advice!! ;)

1348757461.0,10kciw,College LeanGains: A Guide,frogpjb,113,20,18,"So having seen many questions regarding doing LeanGains while in college

**Okay
&gt; Yes! It works *amazing* for college. Having done several other diet styles, you're going to have seriously increased concentration. I plan my most difficult classes to be during the fast (organic chemistry) so that I can benefit from this. 

**Irritability?**
&gt;Chug coffee or green tea (you hipster) like there's no tomorrow

**Scheduling**
&gt;This is the other wonderful thing about LeanGains. *You can sleep an extra half an hour because you're skipping breakfast bro!* As you college students will know

&gt;In terms of scheduling the fast, and don't worry if it ends up being a 14 hour fast or 13 hour rather than a 16 hour one. Just do the best you can. I do recommend timing the window so you can have dinner with your bros though. 

**Workouts**
&gt;I strongly recommend scheduling your workouts on a M-W-F cycle. While scheduling things F-S-T or something like that may make things easier because you'll be working out on the weekend

&gt;In terms of timing around classes. You have a few options, get to the gym, shower, and get to class in 2 hours, which means I get up at 8 M-W-F to lift before my 10 am classes. If it takes you longer than that to get in and out of the gym (assuming a short commute to the university gym of course) you need to stop masturbating in the shower and stop doing curls in the squat rack, brah. So basically, you just need to find some 1:45 to 2 hour spaces you can lift in on M-W-F. If that means eating at night, don't stress about the fast. If you miss the 16 hour window on your workout days don't worry about it. Get your calories in and move on.

**Drinking**
&gt;Woah there man

&gt;EDIT: Thought I'd add it what dbpdaemon said about drinking hard alcohol: if you're gonna drink

**Meeting Macros**
&gt;For those of you with a sick dining hall(s) and meal plan, easily. This can definitely help save you money. 

&gt;For those of you with a money based meal plan or a bad dining hall that doesn't serve lots of protein, peanut butter, Greek yogurt and cottage cheese. I buy these in bulk and eat them to try to bring down the cost per week of my current meal plan. Overall though, if you're on a meal plan you probably won't have complete control over your diet, so don't stress if you get too many fats on your workout days or too many carbs on rest days. Just do the best you can, and keep your calories in line. Consistency and calories matter the most.

&gt;[EDIT: Added link to useful comment by wesimplymustknow about preparing your own protein.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/10kciw/college_leangains_a_guide/c6ei2z2)

&gt;Also, so I recommend using the info on their site as a starting point and then tweaking from common sense (I don't think that one chicken breast had 70g of protein and 110 carbs, thank you very much BC).

Literally the only items on the menu:  white rice (heaps), green leafy vegetables, starchy root vegetables like cassava, tempeh, chicken and beef.

**Diet:**

* Leagains
* 2 meals a day
* Macros split in grams (Protein/Carb/Fat): Training day - 130/170/50
* No calorie counting
* Greens (Cucumber, broccoli) with every meal, not counted against macros
* Snacking and incorporating some 'junk' like chips
* Very little dairy

* Carb sources: All kinds but mainly breads, and I counted all sugars as carbs 
* Fibre sources: Lentils
* Did not worry about sodium at all.


**Exercise:**

* Based on Starting Strength
* Lifting 3 days a week. Occasional 4th day for assitance excercises for abs
* 4 main compound lifts done first in workout sessions - squat. bench
* Added in chin ups &amp; pendlay rows after 2 months as I felt I was recovering well and could handle more volume


**Current weights on major lifts** (consistent strength gains and only just hitting a plateau):

* Bench: 5 x 120 lbs 
* Squat: 5 x 200 lbs 
* Deadlift: 5 x 250 lbs 
* Overhead press: 5 x 75lbs 


**Motivation:**

* Breaking an ankle and getting a plate and pins put in


**Learnings:**

* I will never see nutrition and eating in the same light ever again. This is from a past of having tried the whole 6 meals and training, crisps and giant bars of chocolates, coke instead of water).
* I think the key for me has been consistency with the workouts. I probably missed one session since I started. And putting form before weights and ego has helped with avoiding injury. (touch wood)
* Have proved to myself that it's possible to do this at home with a simple setup (cost me $650 for all my equipment

First go to My Home -&gt; Goals -&gt; Change Goals

There are two ways to do it, but if it's 25/75 - 75/25 or such then method B).

**Method A: Only calorie goal changes**

This is easy. Say you have 1500 calories on rest days, just make a new exercise on myfitnesspal called 'Workout Day Surplus' or something, and make it be worth 500 calories. Click 'Exercises' on top, then 'My Exercises', and make a new cardiovascular exercises. Time or name doesn't matter, what's important is that the calories burned is equal to the difference between your rest day and workout day calories.

Now, and also automatically adjust the macros ratios. Magic!

**Method B: Both calorie goal and macro ratio change**

This is a little trickier. First, create a new food, which has a calorific value of -dR, a carb value of -dC, and a fat value of dF. Yes, myfitnesspal allows negative values, heh. Now, the carbs/fats/calories remaining will be correct for workout day levels.

Since method B might be a little confusing

* 1/2 lb chicken breast
* 1/2 lb turkey breast
* 1/2 lb shrimp
* 1/2 lb lean white fish (eg: tilapia
* one dozen egg whites
* 50g protein worth of protein powder

&gt; So if you needed 150g protein on workout days

###Step 4: Plan your rest day fats.

Rest days should be a bit of a mental break in terms of strict macroing

Fattier meats/fish? Go for it. Coconut butter straight from the jar? Sure.

&gt; For this example

----

###Step 5: Fill your rest day remaining protein.

Unless you're a ghee-from-the-jar kind of person

Chances are good, the more lean protein you'll need to supplement.)

&gt; For example, but my goal is 200g protein on rest days, so I still need 140g of it. How do I get it? See step 3 for a list of lean proteins.

----

###Step 6: Fill with vegetables.

Don't forget your veggies! A common leangains mistake is to be so focussed on foods that complete macro ratios that you forget all about your veggies.

&gt; I like to plan for ~1.5-2 lb veggies per day

Remember that veggies keep you full on rest days (yay!) and help reduce insulin spikes on high-carb workout days (yay!).",,t5_2saqe,1343735073.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/xfzz6/lean_gains_food_shopping_guide/

The **long story:** I was a fat fuck. I was 255 pounds, and had a myriad of other health problems. Couldn't walk a flight of stairs, couldn't lift a fucking thing. After my stroke, I split up with my fiance of 7 years. That was it. I decided enough was enough.

The first couple of months were me being mopey and starving myself. I dropped 20 pounds in the first few weeks. Losing weight was awesome. I wanted more. I spent every waking moment researching fitness and nutrition. I quickly dispelled all the bullshit magazine myths about stupid workout routines and decided I wanted to gain strength and not look like a fat fuck anymore. I started IF in February of 2012, and I couldn't do a pull-up; not even a neg. I didn't let that shit deter me, and I kept at it. I tweaked my diet, I pushed myself hard, and I would not relent. 

At first it was pretty basic LG. Once I hit 200/300/400

This post will include my final thoughts

----

First

1. **To people concerned about the amount of soy I take in and the effect on estrogen:** 

&gt;It has none.  At least, I did the smart thing: I ordered bloodwork from LabCorps before I began.  I got the Male Hormone Panel, which includes testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, and some others.  Cost was less than $200.  All my hormones were in range.

&gt;Three months later, they were marginally lower.  Not a significant difference.  Accounted by regular hormonal fluctuations.)  No ill-effects on any other hormones, either.  That eased any worries I had lurking in the back of my mind.

&gt;The lesson?  Take everything you read with a grain of salt

**Next

[**hughdaddy**


&gt;When the site first came out I put up the link here
It had 2 Word documents, calorie calculator, and weight log. Everything jives 100% with what's said here, except for small details where 31minutes is interjecting his own experience.  
This is it folks, as I believe most people fail on Leangains by leaving too much to chance when it comes to meals/food choices - deciding each day what to eat is a huge cognitive waste and drains willpower, dangerous things for a diet.

[**my_clam**


&gt;You keep the training day at maintenance - 0. Then adjust the rest days as low as needed to get the weekly deficit you want for the BF range you're in (9-11% - 1lb a week - 3500kCal weekly deficit).  
Adjust the carbs for the rest days to only 7% (you can overshoot this number with fibre but it doesn't count). That way the fat ratio is larger. These numbers fit in accordance to 31minutes numbers.  
The rest days seem brutal but I think I like it. It means the cut will be over quicker. I thought I was going to have to start my cut soon to get shredded in time for summer


---

**And finally


&gt;Sub has value, paying clients.  

&gt;If people use *this* as their starting point

&gt;It's about community and helping one another.  The last thing I wanted was to see Martin's method of LeanGains die out because he quit.  It is

&gt;People consider Andy as the last standing LG authority.  Andy tries hard

&gt;I've laid out Martin's entire program here.  Everybody has full access to it.  What people do with it is up to them.  The ""LeanGains Magic"" will not die as long as my AMA and this thread stays up.

1365788189.0,1c7va7,Questioning the calorie deficit dogma.,alycks,82,9,73,"I'm in the process of scouring the literature to answer my question

Is it really possible for trained individuals at a healthy weight to lose fat free mass eating a low calorie/high protein diet in conjunction with sparse

My hypothesis is that such a thing would be very difficult. [This article](http://fitnessblackbook.com/main/starvation-mode-why-you-probably-never-need-to-worry-about-it/) details a military study in which lean, these guys were basically tortured and it's safe to assume none of them were eating enough protein or engaging in strength training. Now, I can't find the original study to confirm these findings, but if they're true that seems to really damage the notion that non-super lean individuals can lose muscle tissue just by not eating enough protein. This study (if it exists and has been accurately represented here) is the only one I've ever seen to expose lean, trained men to a VLCD.

The only studies I can ever find on this subject are on obese individuals. [This study](http://www.jacn.org/content/18/2/115.full) put obese individuals on an 800 calorie/day diet and had them either participate in resistance training or aerobic training. The resistance training group lost **30.8 lbs fat** and only **0.88 lbs lean mass.** The aerobic group was not as impressive - they lost 28 lbs fat and 9 lbs LBM

Now, I've never tried a very low calorie diet while being very lean. I've never been very lean - only down to about 14% body fat. But on a previous cut (22% &gt; 16%) I ate at a consistent -750 deficit diet and increased all my lifts. I'm an experienced weight lifter (&gt; 5 years, 1.25xBW bench; 2.0xBW squat; 2.1xBW deadlift) so these weren't noob gains. I've been eating 1,500 calories/day for 3 weeks and my lifts keep going up. I've lost 4.2 lbs in that time period and, according to my constant and/or increasing lifts, that's almost entirely fat loss.

My personal opinion is that trained, as far as I know, basically perfect: fasted RPT weight training 3x a week, 30 min fasted LISS cardio every day, 1 g/lb LBM protein, and cycled macronutrients. The only ""blemish"" might be a constant 1,500 calorie level

Lessons learned:

1. A caloric deficit is good

2. A caloric surplus is good

3. Want to reduce the binging? Don't be too strict with your diet

4. Don't expect to keep on increasing your strength on a cut, I broke my plateau, and gained a bit of muscle and strength. Some of you might be saying ""duh!"" right now, but I bet that there are many people out there who continue to attempt cutting and gaining strength for far too long, and without much success (I am guilty of this).

5. This might sound counter-intuitive, but that is something that I went through after reaching a weight loss plateau.

6. When I starting LG, and eventually ended up working out 3 times a week and no cardio, and my fat loss did not slow down. It all depends on your calories. I honestly believe that it is 80% food and 20% exercise at this moment in time. Your joints will also thank you in the long run, sorry rotator cuff!

I am sure that there will be those who might disagree with me

When I started LeanGains I had been out of the gym for several years (as you can probably tell from a chest that was pathetically devoid of muscle) so I chose StrongLifts to get back into the habit of lifting. I think I'm beginning to reach the maximum gains I can expect from lifting according to that protocol, as promoted by Medhi of StongLifts, or the RPT program as recommended by Martin. In all, I've found LeanGains to be an incredibly effective way to manage my diet. While my change isn't as impressive as some of the results others have experienced, they are real and they have been relatively easy to come by. I might also mention that I try to integrate the Primal Blueprint/Paleo diet recommendations into what I do (I probably eat more quinoa and beans than the PB would recommend and more dairy than the Paleo community would recommend). This might explain why my results are not as striking as some because generally my macros are slightly skewed from my targets (I generally get more fat and fewer carbs than my targets).

* Dips: BW+45 --&gt; BW+75
* LISS on rest days for the first 8 weeks (no LISS following that)
* Notes: while I deviated in the specific structure of my lifting plan

**Supplements**

* Yohimbine HCl
* Creatine
* Multivitamin
* Fish Oil
* Calcium / Vitamin D
* BCAAs pre-workout
* Whey Protein
* Notes: I'm not sure whether or not the Yohimbine aided in fat burn and if the creatine was helpful during the lifting sessions. I stopped taking both of these supplements in my final week and noticed a drop in weight (most likely due to water loss). The Yohimbine may have been doing a good job of staving off hunger as I felt quite hungry in the mornings this past week. As for creatine

**Diet**

* High protein every day (150-200g)
* High carb (&gt;250g) and low fat (&lt;30g) on workout days
* High fat (&gt;75g) and low carb (&lt;50g) on rest days
* Eating window of 11am - 7pm
* Drank on average once a week (maybe 8 times out of the 11 weekends)
* All calories were consumed post-workout with the exception of BCAAs
* Weeks 1-7: 2400/1600 Workout Day (WOD)/Rest Day (RD) split
* Weeks 8-10: 2650/1750 WOD/RD split
* Weeks 11-12: 2300/1700 WOD/RD split
* Notes: I ate healthy most of the time. However, I had a box of low-fat pop-tarts. Another common post-workout meal was 2 footlong subs from Subway. I also want to say that you can definitely get good results and still enjoy yourself and have a few drinks, provided its done carefully and in moderation.

**Calculations**

I always recorded how much I ate and how much I walked. Below are some calculations that sate my curiosity.

* Total Calories Burned (TCB) due to walking (both LISS and daily walking) = 38360 kcal
* Total Calories Consumed (TCC) = 166300 kcal
* Effective Calories Consumed (ECC = TCC - TCB) = 127940 kcal
* Weight Loss Calories (WLC = 8 lbs x 3500 kcals / lb) = 28000 kcal
* Calories for Sedentary Maintenance (CSM = ECC + WLC) = 155940 kcal
* Calories for Sedentary Maintenance / Day (CSM/D = CSM / 82 days) = **1900 kcal / day**
* Calories for Active Maintenance (CAM = TCC + WLC) = 194300 kcal
* Calories for Active Maintenance / Day (CAM/D = CAM / 82 days) = **2370 kcal / day**
* Notes: This is assuming I lost 8lbs of fat. It is also assuming that the tool I used to track calories burned walking was accurate. Putting aside these gaping holes in reliability and accuracy, I would have guess somewhere between 2300 and 2400 kcal, which is indeed close to my calculated value of 2370 kcal.

**Goals Evaluation**

After 12 weeks

**Future Goals**

I am going to continue working towards that unflexed six pack! I think it's a better goal than a specific bodyfat % as a number seems awfully arbitrary, I'm think of performing a slow cut to the level of leanness I want.

I started out at 145lb and am now 135lb.  I did a -30/-10 cut to shed all the unnecessary body fat.  I also followed the RPT Training method while on LG.  Like most people i was skeptical of LG initially but kept seeing all these results and said Fuck this i'm trying it out.  The first week was tough adapting to the diet and the whole intermittent fasting but after that it was a cakewalk.  I made great progress in my lifts.

Ha


I am 28 years-old, fasted 16 hours with an eight hour feeding window (1PM-9PM), hit my macros while enjoying IFIFYM, lifted heavy and slept normally. I got accustomed to the fasting period and enjoyed it (though I was occasionally irritable), but the only thing that happened other than that was I felt like crap and I didn't lose any weight.


I know a lot of people will say I did something wrong. I thought so


But it was something a user here commented on that caught my attention one day. He or she said, poor insulin metabolism might be the culprit. My 300-400 grams of carbs on workout days might not be in my best interest. 


So, and I feel much better and am now without the mood and energy swings that plagued me before. In one month I have lost about 12 pounds and my lifts are still solid.


I know that Leangains has worked for a lot of people in this subreddit


I still think Leangains is a valuable tool for cutting while helping keep hunger at bay, even on training days (if you feel the need to carb cycle at all). 


I don't have a good pic of me

*edit: Added larger spaces between paragraphs

*edit: Some people seem to be missing a big point of my post. If you feel like crap after you eat, eating 200-500 grams of carbs in one sitting might exacerbate your situation. MAYBE!

## Bodyfat calculation

I'm aware of the fact that the bodyfat calculation is very inaccurate. That's why there's a way to supply your own estimation. *LBM* is relevant to calculate the required *protein*:

Just another dude with a program issue
I used to be 200kg, running etc. but that’s another story). 

Therefor I got a lot of over-due skin. Had a skin overation for the stomach area but the arms

Been doing gym since Nov 2010

Since the weightloss ive been slowly going down to 80 and been around 80-85 since I started to gym.

My activity factor is between 1.35-1.5 pending on the day but lets keep it on the downlow and say 1.35.

I’m 184 cm tall

My BMR is 1936 kcal

TDEE is 2662 (balance)

LBM on 74 kilo (8kg fat)

9.7 BF according to calculation.

Since I got all this overdue skin its kind of hard to know my exact weight guess the diff could be around 2-3kg

I do 3x/ LBM protein which comes out: 222.

222 P = 888 cal


Should I go with +10 -20 or +10 -30?

Training: 2900 cal 435 C 32 F   

-20: 2100 cal 105 C 90 F

-30: 1900 cal 50 C 85 F


P is kept 222 both days.

-30 = -0.31 /week

-20 = -0.17kg / week



My lifts:

150 v 3 Deadlift

120 v 7 Squat (got a leg problem therefor I go slowly on the squats)

85 v 2 Bench

60 v 8 Shoulder press

+10kg v 10 DIPS

+15kg v 5 Chinups

+10kg v 10 Chinups



Would be nice to hear your input my ‘brothers/sisters in arms’!

Thanks!

Before the hiatus I ate maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days. I saw pretty good results with this setup.  After the PT test I decided to try eating at a deficit everyday (roughly -20/-40) and incorporated some LISS in the mornings.  Saw great results with this.  

For weightlifting I did:

M: Deadlifts

W: Weighted Push-ups on Rings

F: Weighted Walking Lunges

Hi there

I'm 36 years old

I was using RPT workout

The macros used during recomp are on the imgur album.

**This were my stats on December 12

Weight: 148
Body Fat: around 20%

**This are my stats today:**

Weight: 132 lb
Body Fat: around 13-14%??

**Album:**

I've been in a brake for two weeks eating at maintenance preparing for a slow bulk

* 1) I'm planing to use Greyskull LP during my slow bulk
* 2) Can I keep training fasted during bulk
* 3) I'm using 12grams of Purple Wraath as BCAA is this the right amount?
* 4) I have a tube of MP Assault that is 40 cal per serving
* 5) How ofter should I recalculate my macros during bulk?

The calculated macros for slow bulk are on the imgur album

I'm not sure about carbs on rest day
The same for fats on workout days  are those numbers too high?

Thank you guys.

With all the LG'ers in this subreddit we could probably come up with some pretty damn good tips/tricks.  I'm just starting my 2nd cut with Leangains and here are a few things that have really helped out:

* check out [EpicureanBodybuilder.com](http://www.epicureanbb.com/).  It's a food blog written by a sister of one of the creators of Fitocracy.  All the recipes are designed to be ""Leangains friendly"".

* BBQ up half a dozen chicken breasts at a time and store them in your fridge - they always come in handy and it's a huge time saver!

* If your PWO meal is getting too damn big to eat and you lay on the couch after like a boa constrictor trying to digest an antelope, and protein powder can go a a long way as far as hitting your macronutrients are concerned.  

Another way to make eating 3000+ cals in an 8 hour window on workout days easy is to utilize fasted training.  This does a couple things.  1) It allows you to break your fast with your biggest meal of the day (when your are obviously your most hungry) and 2) it gives you basically your whole 8 hour window to eat your other

* Check out Andy at [rippedbody.jp](http://rippedbody.jp/category/english/).  He has a ton of free info on his site to make dieting and training super easy while following Leangains.

* Weigh yourself weekly and take measurements - always in the morning before you have eaten.  If you are losing or gaining weight too fast

That's a few off the top of my head - Feel free to add.

[January to May](http://imgur.com/a/UAXdA#0) (tight boxer briefs warning)

*Background:*

I've been really interested in fitness for some years now. I'd been into lifting on and off since college, with the intent of building muscle on a small frame. That didn't pan out the way I wanted to (didn't eat nearly enough). Eventually, my interest waned and I let myself go again.

Summer of last year rolls around, and I was down to 180 prior to finals, when I let go. That and Christmas gave me about 10 lbs.

Somewhere in all this I discovered reddit, or a slight variation thereof.

**Routine:**

I felt as though SS workouts were awesome, compound lifts, squats every workout, and linear progression. My program is based more off the SS Practical Programming variant, you could say. I don't do clean &amp; jerk, and added pull-ups to every workout. I also started off doing captains chair or bicycle crunches for an abdominal workout.

Recently, Pendlay row, barbell calf raises, and an acessory chest exercise I am switching with something else as well.

Warm-up sets are different to. I generally do 3x5 at 40%/60%/80% of my work weight for that day.

In retrospect

You can see my workout in detail on my [Fitocracy page](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/jc214x/).

You may notice my DL/Bench are on the low side, earlier this year, I pulled a rotator cuff muscle, which put a stop on my bench/press progress for a few weeks. I have never in my life stressed proper form as much as I do now.

You will also notice the relative lack of substantial progress between April and May in my photos. I took a 2 1/2 week hiatus from lifting for finals.

***Edit:***
If you can see my fitocracy page, and simply alternate between the two. Here's how I have it set up currently:

A:

* Squat (3x5)
* DL (3x5)
* Bench (3x5)
* Weighted Pull-up (3x5)
* Standing Barbell Calf Raise (3x10)
* Hanging leg raise (sometimes) (3x10)
* DB Flyes (subbing out) (3x10)

B:

* Squat (3x5)
* Press (3x5)
* Bench (3x5)
* Weighted Pull-up (3x5)
* Pendlay row (removing) (3x10)
* Lateral Delt Raise (3x5)
* Hanging leg raise (sometimes) (3x10)

This is the general scheme. I'm actually in the process of trying to simplify it

On rest days

**Diet:**

For the first two months or so, shooting for a fairly consistent net deficit. After midterms, I decided to switch to a Leangains-style diet. Little to no food pre-workout, low carb on rest days, low fat on workout days. It seems to have worked fairly well - I have not had any long-term stalls on any of my lifts (aside from press, always has been a challenge). I have deloaded my squat once or twice. Progress is slower than I expect it to be if I were bulking, but that's how it goes.

You can see my diet in detail on my [MFP page](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/jc214x).

**My goals now:**

Bulk. It's time. Shooting for a fairly consistent 3000-3200 Cals/day for 8 weeks or so. Low fat. After this

**Macros**

TDEE: 2446

Rest days: 1957 cals (-20%); 82g carbs; 109g fat; 163g protein

Workout days: 2935 cals (+20%); 428g carbs; 63g fat; 163g protein

I was very strict with my macros. I weighed and recorded everything. Basically hit them close to spot on everyday. Some days I would exceed my protein

**Before**

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/hAWGE) (taken about mid-December; shitty posing...)

The above pictures were taken right before I went on a 3-week Winter break. During that time I didn't lift or strictly monitor my intake. Shortly after I got back to school early January I began the recomp.

**After**

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/mXSzp) (taken yesterday

The above pictures were taken at the end of a 1-week Spring break. Just like over Winter break

I guess the 2 albums are about 3 months apart

**Routine**

I basically continued doing the program I started back in September

Monday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 3 sets of weighted chins

Wednesday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 1x5 DL
4. 3 sets of weighted pull ups

Friday:

1. 3x5 Squat
2. 3x5 Bench OR 5x3 OHP (alternating)
3. 3 sets of weighted chins

**Progress**

Squat (5RM): 215 -&gt; 240 (focused a lot on getting my form down)

OHP (3RM): 115 -&gt; 140

Bench (5RM): 175 -&gt; 195

Deadlift (5RM): 180 -&gt; 240 (started on 1/30/13 due to back injury)

Chin Ups: Bodyweight (16 reps) -&gt; 55 (6 reps)

Pull Ups: Bodyweight (14 reps) -&gt; 45 (7 reps)

Bodyweight: ~163 -&gt; ~161 (end of recomp) -&gt; ~164 (after Spring break)

Height: 5'10'' -&gt; 5'10'' (no surprise there...)

I don't own a scale

If you have any questions feel free to ask! I switched to a -30/+10 cut today and changed my routine to RPT. I plan on following it all through the Summer. I'll be sure to keep you guys up to date on my progress!

**Workout A:** Squats, Chin-ups

**Workout B:** Squats

As I mentioned

Working time around 12 or 1. 10g BCAA before leaving home. i slowly drink 30g of whey protein and 5g of L-glutamine during the workout.

**Chin-ups:** Bodyweight (152) --&gt; Bodyweight (146) + 37.5 == 183.5

**Overhead Press:** 90 --&gt; 110

**Pendlay Row:** 65 --&gt; 132 (Weight was artificially low to learn form at first)

-----
**Edit:** Added Diet and tracking sections
----


###Diet
----

As I mentioned in the comments

Two things helped me succeed at this despite not focussing on the numbers:

* I spend four days tracking everything I ate. That gave me a pretty good intuitive sense of how much protein and how many calories I was getting.
* I stopped eating sugar and junk food. You *can* eat junk and succeed at leangains

**Main Foods**

I pretty much eat the same thing each workout and rest day. 

Workout days: 400g of smoked salmon, vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchee and kombucha. Sometimes skim milk. Whey protein and l-glutamine post workout.

Rest Days: 4 eggs, chicken, cottage cheese, berries, vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchee and often kombucha. Sometimes whey protein if I didn't get enough protein.

Might be too much smoked salmon...but hey

I tried casein

###Tracking
----

I do track a few things that have really helped. 

* Scale Weight
* Weight lifted + reps + subjective measures such as strain

If scale weight is going down and weight lifted it going up

I found that simply tracking my scale weight each day helped accelerate losses. Likewise,,False,,t5_2saqe,1342186761.0,,True
1375377027.0,1ji75b,"LG, ESE, Combining Diets, Fasting, and Alcohol",47,"So, up until a month ago

You're welcome to dismiss all of this, etc. Yes, it is a wall of text.

**1. Combining LG and ESE**

This can be a struggle over a long term and, but a couple examples:

* **LG @ -40/-20 with two fasted days**: this violates the inherent principles of both plans, cause malnutrition, etc.

* **LG 5 days a week and ESE 2 days per week**: this is different from the first example because I'm assuming you're at maintenance at least one day a week. They take their post-workout meal (say, which may be 600-1200 more calories (depending on what they're doing). Do the math. You have not cut out a full day's worth of calories. You've eliminated the back end of your LG feeding window on the first day (which Martin never accounted for because it's not what he recommends) AND you've just moved your big meal of the day back an hour. **See below for how ESE should work.**

* **TL;DR**: *You CAN combine LG and ESE

**2. Confusing LG with a 16/8 calorie restriction**

I'm not the first to point this out in this forum, not just getting lean. If you're following 16/8 with P90X or Insanity or Turbulence Training or anything that is not *heavy, compound lifts* possibly with some assistance work, you're not doing LG. You will likely get more help from /r/Fitness or /r/fasting! The fasted window is not specifically about caloric restriction, it's about timing your eating to make the most of your workouts. MB went into the science of it, so no point in me repeating his work, but it's there

* **TL;DR**: *LG is not only about caloric restriction... the heavy lifting is part of the theory. 16/8 is a different issue.*

**3. Alcohol &amp; LG**

I love beer and bourbon. I spent much of my 20s proving it. And when I started following ESE and LG, popular reference sources online have very detailed and sourced information), but some highlights that changed my habits:

* alcohol messes up absorption of nutrients
* alcohol increases iron absorption... this was a big one that my doctor and I discussed at length. If I'm following a high protein (lots o' meat) diet, this *could* be a sign... but it could also be something else.)
* if you count alcohol as calories and STILL staying below maintenance (it's possible

The takeaway is that fasting can hurt you if you go for the alcohol during your fed window. I believe Martin found a way around this (back when he was just dropping knowledge bombs and being a god on his site). I'm not saying I don't drink. I have a dark beer or a bourbon two-three nights, especially the bit about how fasting and alcohol can be dangerous.

* **TL;DR**: *drink daily and heavily if you must

**4) Eat Stop Eat Misconceptions**

enough people use a 24-hour fast (and I've been following ESE since the first edition) that I thought I would share some thoughts (some of which I shared in another post here recently). If you're going to follow ESE, like iPhone contracts, LeanGains, evolution, and communism, if you don't actually read what the motherfucker wrote and only go by what you've heard, you're going to have the wrong idea.** Brad put a lot of work (he's up to about 300+ sources now) into his theory.

* **TL;DR**: *ESE is 24 hours of fasting


**TL;DR**: You can combine LG &amp; ESE, and attention to the methods both employ. LG is not necessarily caloric restriction and requires heavy, compound lifts. Fasting and frequent, heavy (&gt;2 drinks) alcohol use can cause issues with nutrient absorption and may increase absorption of iron, causing liver problems. ESE is not just ""stop eating for 24 hours twice a week"" if you want to do it effectively... buy the damn book.

I'm done. I know it's long and I'm sure the formatting could be better. I also know (and forewarned you) that this won't be informative for someone who has been doing LG and/or ESE the right way for a while.

I have been dealing with a left shoulder problem for the last 4 months so my progress isn't as high as it should be. This is because I can't externally rotate my arm due to fluid in my bicep tendon, my physiotherapist said it'll be 4-8 weeks until it's back to normal, doing a series of exercises to lengthen the process. I break easily.

The information I've learnt from reading about here has been so useful
Sorry if people feel this is an inappropriate post but I thought I could encourage others who are undecided about doing leangains and share my experience.

I had been steadily losing weight for the last 3 years or so by trying to cut down my portion size and eat healthier more wholesome foods. I also tried to drastically cut down on fizzy drinks/chocolates.

I then ran the Dublin Half Marathon in September and got to around 81kg (not a very good muscular frame though) but then put on a bit more weight until I found out about LG on 17th of November.
Then did LG with SS for about 9 weeks and then RPT for the last bit (I had previous lifting experience)

TLDR: So basically I was always a fat kid and went from my heaviest which was around 100kg/220lbs and XL t shirts as a teenager to 85kg  before this LG cut to 79kg/174lbs currently!

I want to share with you all
First of all

after two years of ""working out"" and ""eating properly"" I gained around 50 lbs of fat a maybe a bit of muscle doing the basic bodybuilding split routine that the average Joe does...

When I realized that most of the weight I gained was fat, I started doing the fasting and also working out using the Reverse Pyramid method that Martin suggests on his site.

Basically

The progress is really slow but noticeable. 

Sometimes I think I'm not eating enough so my strenght is decreasing.
For example

Right now I feel that I want to change my routine and workout everyday for five days a week

Anyways

These are my stats comparison between February and now:

And, and have the Default Cals/Macros apply on any days that you have not defined (eg: Rest Days) if you prefer.

Note: Using the Default day is OPTIONAL and was only intended to save time for those people whose rest day calories/macros are consistent through the week. If you prefer

I've done a bit of testing of this script and it worked fine for me. :-)
That said, I only modded it).

Zip file containing the script and example data file are located here: http://www.filedropper.com/myfitnesspal7daymacroscript

Instructions:

1. Inside the file ""macros-7d.txt"", [Tuesday], etc. that you want/have specific macro requirements. (As shown in the included .txt, I've defined data for every day)
2. Under the [Default] header input the macros that you will use for non custom days (eg: Rest days). For any day that you do not define macros for
4. If you have defined EVERY day
5. You MUST delete days (ie: delete the header ""[Monday]""
5. Using the Default header will help those people who only customise their macros for a few of the days of the week. For those who do customise all 7 days
6. Protein/Fat/Carb percentages can only be a multiple of 5 (eg: 5, 70, etc. Not 23, 31, 78, etc)
7. Enjoy.

WARNING: The download is a script file and data file ONLY! If you are using Python on your PC/device then the scripts should be easy to get working (see Xablor's thread for some help). I apologise

FYI: I'm using Tasker+SL4A on my Android phone (Galaxy S3) to run this script at 00:01 AM each day

This story is to get two points across:

a.) Even if you mess up/gain weight/whatever reason that you fall off the wagon - you **CAN** get on again.

b.) LG works.  Amazingly well (as if most of us didn't know this already).

There are a few pics here.

So....what happens when you lose that much weight and don't get the results you want (all the while people are telling you you're way too skinny)?  You start to believe what they're saying....and you eat. I ate everything I saw (and of course with all the shit food

http://i.imgur.com/2xWpN.jpg

And in early April......at ~185 pounds.

http://i.imgur.com/IL6XV.jpg

So....at this point...summer is coming up and I swear...there is nothing like the disappointment I felt knowing that I wanted abs

**Enter Andy Morgan**  I had read about LG for months and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I needed someone to get me on track (because I clearly couldn't do it on my own) so I emailed Andy.  From day one

This is my starting picture I sent to him on May 12

http://i.imgur.com/kuRuc.jpg

Needless to say - LG went against everything I learned in 2011.  In 2011

Here's the final picture I sent him on August 5

http://i.imgur.com/NzJmq.jpg

After spending a year looking for abs....here they are.  During a cut.  Better progress than the whole year of 2011 in months.  With several out of town weekends.  Eating two meals a day.  It's still hard for me to believe...but it worked.  My lifts stayed consistent (while some even went up) **AND** I even had lower back issues which took DL's and Squats out of my routine for the last half of the 12 week period.  

Here's a pic from last week (at ~160 pounds):

http://i.imgur.com/9HcHQ.jpg

I know this is a lot of text....but if you take nothing else from this

a.) If you mess up

b.) **Andy Morgan at rippedbody.jp knows what he's doing.**  I had my doubts at first....even well into the first month when he'd say things like *""Look forward to seeing what the next few weeks brings.""*

Now....time to slow bulk.  Will update in a few months!  Good luck everyone.

Edit: If this seems like a big push for Andy's services

[**Me after a year at 155 lbs**](http://imgur.com/rQmz9) of finally controlling my diet and working out. Until this point I was still using bro-science logic. Small meals 7 times a day

Middle of the semester **I got really interested in power lifting** so decided to go on a bulk upto **175 lbs**. This was a traditional bulk where I basically ate what ever I could. I did see strength gains but also a lot of fat gain. I bulked till January of 2012 at which point I decided to go on a cut. 

* **January 2012 : Discovery of Leangains**

One of my friends who's also a power lifting enthusiast introduced me to Leangains and. I loved it. Eating big meals a couple times a day was great. I didn't have to carry around little tupper ware bowls any more so I can eat every 2 hours and **being on an empty stomach during the morning hours made me feel light and active**. In about 3 months **I cut down to 164 lbs using a -40/+30 split

* **May - August 2012** 

Summer consisted of a **Leangains bulk** but it was a lot less meticulous. I did little to no calorie counting. I measured my caloric intake with my lifts. If my lifts were getting harder

* **Fall of 2012**

[**Here are a few pictures of myself now.**](http://imgur.com/a/nleJw). I am still using leangains 16/8 hour fasted-fed split and my rough calorie measuring technique. I realize that I'm not as lean as most progress pics on here but that's not really what I'm going for. It took me about a year of actually counting calories to get to the point where I can eye ball the ammount of food I need. The only supplement I use right now is **Creatine** and I can't recommend it enough. I don't have any protein powders

Before the glucose test you are to fast for minimum 10 hours.  I wound up fasting for 17 hours. During the fast I  played hockey and did a 1.5 hour hike (during the fast).

I did all my blood work and a few things came back out of whack.  Urea and Bicarbonate... figured so much

My ALT (primary liver function)came back fine

What was really crazy was my Bilirubin (turned over red blood cells) came back nearly double.  38 (normal is sub 20).  My blood work came back saying I was in early levels of Jaundais.

I called my DR and he wanted me to get a Liver/Gall Bladder ultrasound.  I had done some reading

Also my AST levels were slightly elevated

I told the DR

I stopped fasting on Wednesday of last week and ate like a normal person for 5 days.  Last night I ate a pizza super late at night to make sure I had plenty of calories to keep me from getting into any sort of fasted state.  

Redid the test today

So this post has a few purposes. 

1) If you get blood work
2) Elevated Bilirubin is actually shown to reduce coronary disease by preventing arterial hardening (http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/14/1476).  
3) Bilirubin is also potentially a potent antioxidant. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029864)

1350244143.0,11h2db,One Year Progress - What I've Learned,bryanno,53,17,42,"I've only recently found this community

Progress Pictures - Unflexed:
http://skitch.com/bryanno/ea9m6/iphoto-2
http://skitch.com/bryanno/ea9m4/iphoto-1.jpg

Starting Weight - 185-195lbs (I had spent the year before crash dieting or following things like 4 Hour Body

Current Weight - 160lbs

* Squat -180x8 &gt; 260x6. 
* Deadlift - 225x7 &gt; 320x8 / 375x1. 
* Bench - 110x8 &gt; 145x12.

I know my numbers aren't wildly impressive and I don't have striking abs

**What I've Learned:**

1. If you're new to all of this
2. Stick with everything you try for at least 3 months. As you get a better understanding of what works for you and moreso what you enjoy the most
3. Not every principle will work for you. IF and the macro splits are great, if you don't follow what's listed, you're not doing a ""modified"" version. You're doing your own thing. That's well and good but in the first year, remember the words of Ygritte, ""You know nothing"". Absorb, learn, progress.
4. Measure, measurements, and record your workouts consistently. If you performed like crap, try to identify why. Not enough sleep? Skipped your coffee? Keep track of this stuff as it will help you improve and also help you feel better if you just couldn't keep up one day at the gym.
5. Find a buddy (and honestly, really made me not feel insane. You're not alone.
6. Take time to rest, and also find your maintenance. In between different 3+ month goals it's not a bad idea to take 1-2 weeks and just figure out what your maintenance calories are. Sometimes I see the most weight loss progress in those two weeks. Lyle Mcdonald has an article on this too.
7. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. I currently pull my shirt up and look at my stomach every time I pass a mirror. I weigh myself daily if there's a scale around. Is this healthy? No freaking way. Talk to somebody about it. My wife hits me if she sees me doing this and I'm thankful she does, and if you already are, let's talk it out.
8. And finally, maybe even most, but if you don't feel awesome, don't do it. Believe me, nobody wants a flat stomach more than me, but this is about living a healthier and sexier life. Abs are useless if you feel and look deflated. THAT'S JUST MY EXPERIENCE and I'm not saying don't do it, but pry yourself away from the idea that if you were making progress on -20/0 then surely -30/-10 means you'll make DOUBLE the progress.

I am just an average joe. I'm not ripped yet. I don't have a ton of muscle mass. But I'm also no longer the kid who skipped gym class because it was the day they made you run a mile. I'm the guy who is DYING to deadlift 405lbs this month so I can say that I went from lifting 225lbs (1.15xbw) for 7 to 405lbs (2.5xbw) for 1 in my first year of lifting.",,t5_2saqe,1350244638.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/11h2db/one_year_progress_what_ive_learned/

I wanted to share my process and help others if possible ..not that im huge or that more knowledgable but i have not lost a single lb now and have a recomp that i didn't think was humanly possible without drugs 

Stats 
* 6'2 205 
* Bench 225x5 
* Squats 225x5 (could do more but every time i go heavy i get knee problems ..bad)
* Deadlift - 275x5 (could do alot more but had back problems for years) 


My recomp here http://imgur.com/a/jT3ei   the skinny picture is after a night of vodka shots LOL ...i just added that to show how big of a change can happen with a whooosh 

Now i have only been to the gym once a week but have done 3 days a week with very little cardio ...(im actually a big runner but haven't much because no time or need to. The crazy thing is i ran the shamrock shuffle (8k) with no training and still ran an 8:13 mile)

But my first two workouts are ""pump training"" with drop sets to failure weighted pushups pullups etc with acessory CURLZZZ and stuff to deplete glycogen and the one day a week in the gym Is a massive 2 hour Power workout with Bench  squats deads millitary weighted dips and more 

Any way sorry to be long winded but here are my tips and tricks that i believe helped me 

Believe it or not this is a -30/-10 and even lower sometimes ....i log everything i eat drink on myfitnesspal and i drink over a gallon of water a day

Work out days 16/8 
Non workout 20/4 


Things i eat 
Fasted -no eating just 
Monster Zero energy drinks  and redbulls Zero 
Lots of water ...lots 

Feasting 
* Steak with a side of steak 
* All other kinds of meats (think this goes without saying)
* Lots of peppers 
* Dannon lite and fit Greek ..lots of it 
* Greek yougert plain 
* Casesin and Whey protien shakes with ice Silk unsweetened almond vanilla milk (30 cals no carbs) 
* Rice cakes with Natty Pb 
* Sweet potato fries (cant remember the brand but low fat) 
* Whole grain cereals 
* Quinoa w/ hot rotel 
* Bacon /turkey bacon on both days 
* LOTS of Avacados ...there expensive but dammit they are awesome 
* Cottage cheese with rasberries and blueberries on top (4% rest days 1% workout days) 

and a little bit of IIFYM 

Condiments 
* My own special sauce ...mashed avacados mixed with greek yougert and siracha .....best ever IMO 
* A1 - how steak is done 
* lots of other hot sauces lol 
* Ketchup on occasion (with my sweet tator fries) 


Supplements 
* Thermogenic containing yohimbe every 2 hours fasted  (finally got some yohimbe coming this week and will be taking this instead soon) 
* Creatine 
* Fish oil 




Anyway i will update this if people have questions ...i know im still a long way from ""ripped"" but i was just excited and wanted to share with the community that helped me out so much 


Also i DEFIANTLY recommend reading ""Eat stop eat"" ""The Stubborn Fat Solution"" and ""The ultimate diet 2.0"" to get a better understanding of how your body works 


Edit ....
Well finally lost some strength in bench .. had to get a spotter for my last reps :(  ....it just felt heavy ...now it could have been because I was an idiot and bored at work so I went and did pushups to failure (Addicted to the pump lull) on Friday and didn't refill my glycogen or just compromised my power day by fatigue ....but I woke up today and had a big Whoosh .. didn't weigh myself after my workout but I wouldn't doubt if I lost 3-5 lb just last night ...I'm not kidding I will post pictures soon ... but think I was holding a lot of water in the above pictures and will probly switch to a -20/+10-20 for this week to be safe ...can't loose those gainz hahaha 
Interestingly enough though my deadlifts felt light and I did up the lb by 30 and added reps to my leg press as well ... still got a little stubborn fat but I'm excited to see what a week or two of a small deficit will bring!!! 
Will post pics tomorrow when I get time to illustrate the whoosh 
Ok the last 3 pictures are post whoosh .. http://imgur.com/a/jT3ei

&gt; Background

&gt;There are limited data regarding the relationship between cannabinoids and metabolic processes. Epidemiologic studies have found lower prevalence rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in marijuana users compared with people who have never used marijuana, glucose, and insulin resistance.

&gt;Methods

&gt;We included 4657 adult men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2010. Marijuana use was assessed by self-report in a private room. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured via blood samples after a 9-hour fast

&gt;Results

&gt;Of the participants in our study sample, −26, −6) and 17% lower HOMA-IR (95% CI, −27, −6). We found significant associations between marijuana use and smaller waist circumferences. Among current users, we found no significant dose-response.

So I began IF last fall. For me it wasn't very difficult at all to skip morning meals, high carb lunch, then another for dinner, and be done eating by around 8 pm, making my fast around 17 hours or so. Everything was going swimmingly until about 3 months ago, when my wife began complaining about a sour smell that seemed to emanate from me. She couldn't really place just what it smelled like (I couldn't smell a thing), other than to say it was sour and was made worse if I had a lot of coffee or had been drinking alcohol. I upped my teeth cleaning, and this really started to freak me out. I should say at this point that my wife was/is pregnant with our 2nd kid, that I was developing diabetes

So finally last week I went to the doctor. After explaining everything to him, enough so that my body could very well achieve a mild ketosis and give off this sour odor, especially in the morning (when, with coffee breath, my wife often notices the odor). 

His solution? Eat breakfast. Even just a little bit, he claimed, and that putting my body in this state is rather unhealthy.

So that's that. I've since started having a small breakfast every morning (a banana and some source of protein)

So that's my story. Any thoughts

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks to all for the responses! It's been great to read through all the theories and suggestions as to why the hell I smell. I think it's safe to say that the odor my (pregnant) wife detects is diet-related. A high ketone count combined with coffee breath in the morning could make the symptoms worse

Edit: 

Workouts:

I spent a good 5-6 years lifting very consistantly before beginning to rock climb about two years ago. When I started to climb, dl 285x4, bench 205x1 (sort of floundered at those numbers for a while). About a year ago, I started adding some lifting back in, mainly bench/military press to offset all of the pulling I do while climbing. Currently I bench RPT using dumbells and my last work set was 90s x 5. I will do the occasional (once ever couple weeks, if I can't climb) pulling RPT workout. I am going to start adding some leg work back in for reasons of injury prevention, but haven't done any meaningful leg work in 2 years. Basically, so I'm trying to drop it.

""Average adult male needs about 130 g/day.

""130 g is a number that gets thrown around as a general guideline for the adult

""But since brain size and energy consumption is not as variable as say body weight and BMR (i.e brain size does not vary much between individuals vs body weight/activity)

In my [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1evf81/average_adult_male_needs_about_130g_of_carbs_a/ca4eewg) I dismissed the number out of hand

The [2006 Institute of Medicine Dietary References Intake (DRI)](http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2006/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Essential-Guide-Nutrient-Requirements.aspx) is where 130 grams per day comes from. The relevant chapter is Dietary Carbohydrates: Sugars and Starches. In this chapter

The chapter on carbohydrates describe typical carbs in the diet and provides an overview on carbohydrate digestion. Here are two important quotes in the chapter:

""The requirements for carbohydrates are based on the average minimum amount of glucose that is utilized by the brain...The recommended amount also prevents ketosis

""The amount of dietary carbohydrate that confers optimal health is unknown. The ability of humans to endure weeks of starvation after endogenous glycogen supplies are exhausted is indicative of the body's ability to survive without an exogenous supply of glucose. However

These points inform [this excellent article by Lyle McDonald](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/how-many-carbohydrates-do-you-need.html). In the article, and Martin knows that - he even said the 130 gram number carries the assumption of avoiding ketosis. So the 100-130 gram numbers created by the IoM are not minimum requirements: they're merely guidelines for good health, fueling the brain, and avoiding ketosis. 

Although I do perfectly well in ketosis, they just feel ""hungry"" and maybe a little ""grumpy"" so they assume their brain has stopped working due to the low carbohydrates. In any case, everyone's different and I shouldn't assume a low carb brain fog is impossible. So I shouldn't have dismissed the 130 gram number out of hand. (I do, however, stand by the fact that most /r/leangains readers should adhere to the [top all-time post: KISS and Do It!](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/13ice8/kiss_and_do_it/) and stop fucking around with the sidebar calculator when they're not shredded after 14 days of leangains dieting.) 

**tl;dr: 130 grams carbohydrates per day is the RDA set by the Institute of Medicine and it's designed as a guideline (not a minimum) for good health and avoiding ketosis.**

1366401582.0,1cp1uh,Best way to bulk/cut for aesthethic seekers,,38,9,29,"So many people are scared of bulking or cutting because they don't want to look too fat bloat or scrawny and small.

It doesn't help that usually they're told to just suck it up and that you must sacrifice aesthethics momentarily in order to look good later.

But a friend of mine is always gaining muscles while looking lean year round. After seeing how this is working so well I'm going to use the same approach and suggest the same to those who would rather look decent year around.

What he does is simply +500 calories to gain 5 pounds, when he is 5 pounds heavier he starts to cut, when he is 5 pounds lighter he starts to bulk. At the end of a 4 months cycles he has gained muscles and lost fat, just like recomposition, but better than recomposition, since the bulk is a real bulk and the cut is a real cut while with recomposition you're never sure if you're really gaining or losing and might has well spin your wheel for months without realizing it.

It seems such a banal advice but many people don't think they can change their body in this way since they have been told that a bulk is useless unless done for at least 6-12 months. It sounds as if many believe that the more you're on a bulk the better your body adapts to building muscles. It's actually the opposite, as if the gains would suddenly appears at the end of a long bulk rather than happening evenly through the duration of the bulk. So really, one of the worst broscience concept out there is that you must necessarily bulk for long to gain something out of it.

My friend actually told me he started as a somewhat skinny fat guy and decided with a friend of his to join a gym and to start working out. The he came up with the thought of limiting the bulk to a certain number of pounds gained while his friends chose a more traditional approach. 5 pounds by 5 pounds he trained his way to athletic

[http://www.leangains.com/2009/03/low-carb-again.html](http://www.leangains.com/2009/03/low-carb-again.html)

Look in the comments

&gt;""Average adult male needs about 130 g/day.

&gt;130 g is a number that gets thrown around as a general guideline for the adult

&gt;But since brain size and energy consumption is not as variable as say body weight and BMR (i.e brain size does not vary much between individuals vs body weight/activity)

&gt;One might assume that intellectual activity plays a role here. For example, i.e the glucose/fat ratio tilts a bit more towards glucose whenever you are doing something that requires thinking or problem solving. 

&gt;And of course

Weird because I can't say I feel more sluggish / brain foggish on rest days when I have 40-60g of carbs. But I *do* feel awesome on training days after downing lots of oats. I'll pay more attention to this and track how I feel and function on rest days.

* Ability to specific up to seven different macro goals over a specific period of time. So for example

* All foods can be tracked by grams, so that was another calculation you had to do for each food you ate.

* It tracks every nutrient. Most I've used make you pay to track anything more than calories, and carbs.

* Ability to add custom foods for the day. So for example

* TDEE calculator. I added the ability to track your weight on a per day basis

* Ability to add custom serving sizes. Does your favorite Batman glass hold 2.6 servings of milk? You can save this as a custom serving for even easier tracking.

I'm sure there are other things I'm forgetting, I'm going to add Google custom search as a second option so that should pick up any slack the built in search misses.

Progress to date has been good - I am very pleased. My weight has not changed - as you can see my lean mass gain has more or less matched my fat loss. I don't expect this to last...!

I have not been terribly strict about rotating macros etc - from what I understand that is more important the lower your body fat gets. I'm around +20/-20 at the moment. I break the fast with training around 1pm and eat until 8pm. Most days I will start eating at 2 or 3pm (18-19hr fast). I do not find this difficult.

Progress improved greatly in the last couple of weeks - I attribute this to training stimulus increasing and the fact that my protein and BCAA supplements arrived. I use them on training days only. 

I missed one day of training (Monday 18th) as I was out of the country for a meeting. I fasted on this day instead

Weights are consistently increasing (all 3 sets of 5 as per SS practical programming):

Squat: 90kgs (198lbs) - 135kgs (297lbs)

Deadlift: 120kgs (264lbs) - 150kgs (330lbs)

Bench: 60kgs (132lbs) - 75kgs (165lbs)

Press: 40kgs (88lbs) - 55kgs (121lbs)

Pull ups: 3 sets of 5 strict - 3 sets of 7 strict

Kipping pull ups: 3 sets of 10 - 3 sets of 13

Male, -20/+20 Recomp over 3 months

**Starting Stats:** Weight=184lbs, Bench: 184lbs, DB Press: (not tracked initially, but I'd guess ~95lbs)

**Current Stats:** Weight=173lbs, 195lbs current front squat max), Bench: 196lbs, DB Press: 107lbs

**Background:** I'd done some lifting in the past, regularly playing pickup basketball and biking. Leangains is the first time I've tracked what I eat and had specific nutrition goals, and the first time I've lifted heavy (5 reps or less) since high school.

**Notes on my leansgains experience:** My starting TDEE was 2350 kcals. I recalculated to 2200 kcals about 1 1/2 months in as I lost over 5lbs in weight. Used the 5-3-1 BBB rountine. For the first 2 month I did exclusively dead lifts or squats as my primary lifts, then eat from 1pm–9pm. I'm really pleased with the progress thus far, and frankly this system of working out and nutrition is far more manageable than anything I've done in the past.

**Questions:** 

1. I didn't expect my results to be this significant this fast. Is it possible I miscalculated my TDEE? I have a desk job and only recently started doing cardio on rest days (and adjusted my rest day kcals upward accordingly). Are these results typical of a recomp?

2. Where do I go from here? As a former fatty

3. Estimates on my body fat % please?

All year I've been regularly attending (3-4x week) Crossfit and alternating between keto and primal dieting with occasional indulgences. I lost a lot of progress as I was out of town for most of June and dieting mostly went to shit. 

Three weeks ago I began a -30/-10, QuestBars, vegetables (carrots and broccoli), sweet potatoes and rarely: So Delicious Coconut Ice Cream. I am trying to avoid all breads/grains except on workout days where I'll sometimes eat rice in order to hit my carb intake (I've been avoiding carbs so long it's been tough figuring out how to work them in again). Diet soda has been my nemesis and I'm drinking way too much, so I'm aiming to cut it out entirely over the next week in exchange for water and coffee.

My workout routine: I've cut out CrossFit WODs in exchange for Wendler's 5/3/1 program 4x week and his 'Boring But Big' assistance work. I plan on incorporating some light cardio and Yohimbine HCL supplements 3-4x week. Also

Currently I am using a total of 30g of BCAA during my morning fast/workout and will start titrating that down by 5g a week as long as my progress continues. I am curious to see if I can still maintain consistent progress with a smaller dose.

    Since fiber is often an issue in our diets anyway, and have 10 calories/5g fiber per serving (two gummies). My little trick is, if I have hit my calorie ceiling for the day and still feel like snacking, is to have a couple of these. They take a while to chew, are sweet and won't kill your fasting state really. I'll grab a few if I am hungry in my fasting window, and they really help me feel like I've had something to ""eat"" when really the impact is minimal and quite helpful (5g/fiber per serving).  
    Anyway just thought I'd share my experience with how helpful it's been to have these around the house. They've helped with regularity and sticking to LG a lot easier. Even though some may balk at ingesting calories during the fasting period

I had been using BCAA exactly as prescribed by Martin since I started Leangains because my feeding window is 12-8 and I train at 6am. I had never failed to make the prescribed weight/reps on any workout during that time.

This week I started a new cycle of 5/3/1 and figured I would experiment with not using BCAAs to see if I could cut some cost by no longer using them. This week was all 3x5 workouts and on each main lift I was only able to get 3.5 on the third set. This is the first time since beginning the program that I have not been able to complete the prescribed workout.

The only change in my diet/lifestyle is the removal of BCAA. I did change the timing of my creatine as well though, I took the creatine with my pre-bed magnesium the night before. Most studies I have seen show that the timing of creatine is inconsequential, but nonetheless I will try moving that back to preWO next week to see if I have better success in the gym.

4. Overhead Barbell Press
5. Stiff-Legged Deadlift
6. Barbell Curls
7. Standing Calf Raises

Schedule (3x/week):
Monday - Heavy- 2x8-12 of 10RM adding one rep each week until I hit 12 reps. At which point I reset to 8 reps and increase the weight by 10%. If I fail to complete 2 sets of 12 reps on Week 5 I restart the cycle using the same weight. 2 warm-up sets (25%

Wednesday - Medium - 2x8-12 using 90% of Monday's weight. Starting at 8 reps and adding 1 rep each week until I hit 12 reps. 2 warm-up sets (25%

I did absolutely **NO CARDIO** except yard work and occasional walking

**Diet**

* Before reading Eat Stop Eat/How Much Protein

* Started fasting 16-22 hours a day as I preferred a somewhat consistent feeding window. I wasn't anal about macros. I suppose you could say I fasted LG-style but subscribed to Brad Pilon's relaxed nutritional philosophy more rather than Martin Berkan's high-protein cycling methodology.

* Used FitDay to track calories. As I said

* Started **low** on calories (around a weekly average of 1550 cals) and tapered upward. I think my no-cardio maintenance is in the range of 1950-2100 calories. This week I'm aiming for a week average of ~1800 calories.

Weight as of 1/4/13: 83kg (182.6lbs)
Height 1.77cm ( 5ft 10inches)
Body fat estimate: 14-16%----&gt;9-11% (Taken with the Accu-measure callipers)

I had been doing a -30/-30 (fuck all my muscle mass) aggressive cut for a week which was around 1500 cals. Unbeknownst to me was that I was actually ONLY eating 1500 TOTAL
I've since bumped that up to around 1700 net cals ( If that still sounds wrong

I use MFP to calculate all my calories and weigh as much food as I can. 

I keep to a 2.3g/kg bodyweight intake of protein and usually have to supplement it with ON Gold standard

Speaking of macros: W/O days and rest days P/CHO/F (168/150/50). However on weekends I try to reduce my carbs and increase my fats

Due to my uni schedule I usually eat 2-3 meals although most days I would fast more than 16hrs so I could break my fast after my afternoon workout.
Workout regime (focused more on strength alternating with 5/3/1
Mon- Chest/tri: Flat db press, weighted dips

Tues- Legs/lower back: Squat, front squat, 45 degree leg press

Wed- Back/bi/abs: Penlay rows, db shrugs, EZ-bar curls, hammer curls and a few burn out sets of various weight based ab exercises

Thur- Chest/shoulders: BB bench press, lateral db flys, cable pull throughs???? I don't know what it's called but it smashes my lower pec when pulled across the face of the pectoral.

Fri- Deadlifts: with chalk and weight belt as my lower back has minor lordosis and would otherwise ""snap my shit up"" 

I realise it goes against the 3 workout principle but its working for me.

I'd gladly give more information on my exercises

I found leangains last summer and had good results. Before christmas, changed my training/diet and got fat(ter)/weak. (Fuckarounditis)  
I found Rippedbody.jp a couple of months ago and decided to re-focus my diet and training. I went for a cut at roughly -30/+10.  
Training still suffered a bit of Fuckarounditis
A:  
Squat (RPT
Overhead Press (SS to RPT
Weighted Chins (RPT)  
B:  
Deadlift (RPT
Bench (RPT)  
Single Arm TRX face pulls (SS)  

This has eventually evolved into
M.  
Deadlift (RPT, 8-10) (Those ranges represent targets for each set)  
Weighted Chins (RPT, BW to ""Failure"") (I should lower the rep ranges a bit, I think)  
W.  
Bench (RPT, 10-12+)  
Weighted Dips (Bro-Style
Suspended/Regular Pushups (Bro-Style to failure, can't help it)  
F.  
Squat (RPT, 10-12+) (Hit 15 on my final set this week, for fun)  
Overhead (RPT 6-8
Overhand Pullups (BW 3.8)  
This is essentially the RPT routine on Rippedbody.jp

Here is the current result:  
http://i41.tinypic.com/350os41.jpg

During the first portion of the cut
1. Use a lower BMR multiplier. This allows a little more sanity
2. Keep workouts intense
3. As BF% drops
4. Working in higher rep ranges seems to reduce systemic/CNS fatigue by staying a bit farther from 1RM.  

Current Stats (in LBs):  
DL 275x6 (Going for 285 monday)  
Bench 175x6 (STUCK)  
Weighted Chins BW+45x6  
Squat 255x8  
BW 130-132  
Height 5'4  

I intend to cut a bit longer and then progress into a slow bulk. I really just wanted to share my experience with IF in a public forum

Here are a few points that I have gathered...

* Slower Digestion
        -Since meal timing isn't really an issue
* Satiation
        -Casein is much better at telling my belly that it is full
* Protein = Protein?

Just a thought I had while deciding wether I wanted to restock my 10lb bag of whey or if I wanted to go a different route and buy casein for its satiation benefits.  I know that that casein is a little more expensive but my 10lbs bag lasted me since February and I know I still have a good 10 servings left.

Besides the price


**Edit**
So here is another question.  There was a study done on proteins that gave a percentage of protein that was actually absorbed/available vs. what was advertised.  Were any of these studies credible?

But alas, that I would would be 6-pack bound.
All I wanted to do was lose fat. And the scale was going down so I thought the muscle will just show more and more.

So anyway, but then I compared pics with the mirror and it's very obvious.  I think if I continued like this I could even become some strong rendition of a skinny-fat guy, haha!

I will maintain the 16 hour fast and calorie/carb cycling.  The major changes are to the post-workout dinner (i.e. it's not necessary to eat 2000 clean calories in one sitting)

Just to continue the logic into the rest ""day"" 24 hours--  the next dinner and lunch

Thoughts?  Has anyone tried anything similar?

On January 1st I decided to begin intermittent fasting. I did this for 2 weeks without counting macros or doing actual leangains. 

On january 14th, but honestly I didn't look much different. I made very slight strength gains and made very little body fat loss. 

At this point, and then begin bulking. I've been on a -30+10 cut for about 4 weeks and have seen significant fat losses. 

Here are my progress pictures thus far: http://imgur.com/a/Xg4EF#8LaZ1Gw

Just to keep in mind, just after waking up. 

I am 6'2

In January I was 197 Pounds
I am now 185

I followed the RPT set up as outlined here:

* http://rippedbody.jp/reverse-pyramid-training/ 

but I added accessory exercises to fit my personal goals.

* Mondays: Back/Biceps
* Wednesday: Chest/Tricep
* Friday: Legs/Shoulders

Here is a link to my workout log Excel spreadsheet

http://www.filedropper.com/workoutchart


My January lifting numbers were: 

* Squat: 225x8
* Bench Press: 225x6
* Deadlift: 255x6
* Chin ups: 8 Bodyweight

My March lifting numbers are:

* Squat: 265x7
* Bench Press: 225x4
* Deadlift: 315x6
* Chin ups: 8 with 20 pound weight

For instance Brown Rice and black beans will give you a complete profile just like chicken. But the catch is you end up eating more calories than chicken. Also Oats and Milk are a good combination.

Also we needn't always combine proteins with compelte amino acid profile. For instance

I am just wondering if anyone else notices this and also if you have any idea what causes it.

Now I'm sure some of you will think that it doesn't make a difference and that if I'm DLing correctly the weight should just go up and down, move the bar, or focus on setting the wieght down gingerly enough to not have one of the plates spin. It's also troublesome because I tend to think ""pull back"" on deadlifts, and in getting that initial momentum off the floor, the shape seems to inhibit my motion. More than anything, though, it just messes with my focus.

My question is then, but for some reason a quick google search shows me that some people(like the StrongLifts dude) recommend against this since you're doing a ""rack pull and not a deadlift"" (http://stronglifts.com/deadlifting-with-hexagonal-plates/).

I know that this seems like a ridiculous goal to many of you and I won't argue except to say that I am a rock climber first and foremost--my goals are not primarily driven by my aesthetics nor by my lifts. I have no disrespect for those of you who want to get big and strong--it's just not my jam at the moment.

Thus

Initially, my lifts actually increased a bit. At some point I decided to up my protein intake to 200g/day as I restricted my kcal totals further, hoping to improve my overall recovery. 

At some point in the last 2/3 weeks I decided to give full blast by-Martin's-book carb cycling a go. I restricted my workout day fat to 40-50g and my rest day carbs to 50-75g. I'm uncertain if this was doing anything further or not, it's good. On workout days, this was a pretty minor note. However, on rest days 1 cup of ice cream represents more than half of my carb intake for the day.

You've likely figured out where this is going by now, and general abdominal discomfort. Where satiety had always been a struggle for me, I found myself feeling sickeningly full at the end of my feedings this past week, several times unable to finish. I complained about it a bit to my g/f but never went into detail because, I dunno, I don't talk about my GI tract with most people.

At some point yesterday


TL;DR I cut too much fiber out of my diet during carb cycling and had to squirt saline up my ass. Learn from my mistake.

&gt;For the carbs, bread, potatoes etc…) 80% of the time and you’ll be fine. This is to minimize chances of spill-over into fat stores on your workout days. I’ve expanded on this with and included a quote from Lyle McDonald in the comments below. If you wish to get geekier that that then see the glucose vs. sucrose vs. fructose part of this article by Martin Berkhan.

The quote he mentions:

http://rippedbody.jp/2011/12/17/12-weeks-on-leangains-what-you-can-expect-to-achieve/#comment-2059

&gt;“…people sometimes do notice subjective differences in carb-load quality depending on the types of carbs eaten. Generally
&gt;
&gt;At the same time, pasta) with small amounts of sucrose (usually some type of sherbet or high sugar cereal). The key is to keep starches dominant with small to moderate amounts of fructose or sucrose. This should let you satisfy any nagging cravings you have without ruining the quality of your carb-load.”

The article he mentions:

http://www.leangains.com/2010/11/cheat-day-strategies-for-hedonist.html

&gt;The above is in particular reference to glucose; sucrose and fructose are more lipogenic due to some differences in metabolic pathways. Fructose do not go to muscle glycogen stores
&gt;
&gt;* From results: ""The type of carbohydrate overfeeding (sucrose or glucose) had no significant effect on de novo lipogenesis in either subject group."" Which means that the difference (10-20%) was not enough to be deemed significant from a scientific standpoint. Fructose-overfeeding has not be compared to glucose in a controlled study, half glucose)

and:

&gt;* Sucrose, cakes and alcohol, should preferably be added in last, when you're full from the main meal(s).

I don't have a problem sticking with the IF protocol. I often go 20+ hours w/o food. My problem is stopping eating once I stop. And fighting my cravings/""hunger.""

Fortunately

* 165x5x5 bench

* 190x5x5 squat (shaky form)

* 275x5x1 deadlift

* 105x5x5 OHP 

I still weigh around 155 lbs but I definitely have some more muscle now than I did 3 months ago. It's noticeable in my shoulders and arms. I was initially going to stick to SL5x5 until all my lift numbers were well into the intermediate range on [strength standards](http://www.strstd.com/). 

However, especially when on a cut. In fact, [someone asked him about 5x5 specifically](http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1jjrci/former_berkhan_client_ama/cbfyt85
), so I'm giving his advice some serious thought. At the same time, I'm starting to stall on SL5x5. It's become very hard to add weight every workout onto my bench, OHP, and squat especially. DL is still going up, but I'm sure it will stall soon as well. 

I want some advice/opinions on whether I should stick to SL5x5, and an unplanned surplus on weekends. So it was probably around or slight above maintenance for the week. My maintenance is ~2100 according to the calculation method 31minutes gave us) Could it be that my stall is a result of eating at a deficit during most of the week? Or is just a classic stall that people have with SL5x5, meaning that I just need to keep at it? 

And for what it's worth, went back to 190 and failed that. These last 3 workouts plus the heavy deadlifts I did at the end of two of them have left my entire back and posterior chain sore for multiple days. Perhaps the volume is too high for a cut ...

1372730819.0,1hgwhq,[Progress] My 6 Month LeanGains Experiment,dimshum,20,3,16,"**Overview:**

[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/a/PEriB#0)

I started working out my freshman year of college after I gained the freshman 15 in just one semester. It took 3 years of fucking around to realize that I wasn't where I wanted to be physically. I did some crossfit here and there and focused exclusively on barbell training but still never hit the point where I was satisfied aesthetically. My upper body (shitty genetics) was never on the same level as my lower body.

At the end of January this year

Things that I wanted: more arm definition

Note that I did indeed lose weight though my strength / numbers went up dramatically. For the first 4 months, my weight fluctuated due to a breakup (loss of appetite) and traveling for work, so I couldn't stick to the program as rigidly as I would have liked.

**Stats:**

   * 24M / 5' 11""
   * Weight: 170 lbs -&gt; 166
   * ~2800 cals burned / day - I'm fairly active

**Lifts:**

I leg pressed instead of squatting (don't really enjoy squatting) and didn't really do a good job of tracking my progress. Also

The numbers listed for DB exercises below are for each DB.

   * Deadlift 1RM : 385 -&gt; 410
   * Leg Press 1RM : 520

   * Bench 1RM: 220 -&gt; 250
   * DB Bench (1x8) : 90 (each) -&gt; 100
   * DB Seated Press (1x8) : 65 (each) -&gt; 75
   * DB One-Arm Row (1x10) : 95 (each) -&gt; 110
   * Weighted Chin Up (1x5) : BW + 65 lbs -&gt; BW + 82.5 lbs
   * Weighted Dips (1x5) : BW + 90 lbs -&gt; BW + 110

**Diet:**

I only followed the diet during the weekdays and pretty much ate normally on the weekends. Also

Workout Days - On workout days, but it was really great for me. One shake = 2 cups milk, 2 scoops of whey, 1 banana, 1 cup ice cream = ~900 calories

   * 3300 cals
   * ~500 g carbs
   * ~180-200 g protein

Non-workout days - On these days I only walked and didn't engage in any high intensity exercise. I would just take a break during work and walk around the park for 20 minutes

   * ~2200 cals
   * ~200-220 g protein
   * Sub 100 g carbs

**Routine:**

I incorporated Martin's RPT model with my own modifications. It worked for me and may or may not work for you.

Day 1 - 

   * DB Bench Press - 1x3-5
   * Barbell Bench (subbed for the second DB set every other week) 1x8-10
   * Weighted Chins - 1x3-5
   * Seated Cable Row - 2x10-12
   * Cable Crunch - 2x15

Day 2 - 

   * Deadlift - 1x3-5
   * Leg Press - 1x3-5
   * Weighted Dips - 1x3-5
   * One Arm Row - 2x10
   * Face Pulls - 2x12
   * Chin Up - 2x15
   * Dip Station Leg Raise - 2x20

**Tools I Used:**

   * Fitocracy - My main tool for tracking progress. Excellent to keep on target with your numbers.
   * MyFitnessPal - Enough said.
   * Nike Fuelband - This was actually really great to track my daily caloric expenditure. Wasn't necessarily the most accurate

**What I Learned:**

Through this process, and so the weekdays were the only days I had to work with.

Also

Finally - lean gains really can be a lifestyle diet. I can't really tell you whether or not IF was what made the big difference

**Going Forward:**

In the next 6 months I plan to get back to around 170. Not sure where I stand bodyfat wise currently but I'd like to be at 10%

I'm about 2 weeks into trying this IF/LG lifestyle.  I record EVERYTHING with MFP.  I eat around 1400 calories on rest days and 1800 calories on workout days.

From what I understand

* Protein 40% (~140g)
* Carbs 30% (~100g)
* Fat 30% (~50g)

**But the reality is more like...**

* Protein 21% (ETA: about 90g)
* Carbs 52%
* Fat 27%

As you can see, legumes, quinoa and things like that.  I'm not a vegetarian, but it turns out to be that way for most of my days.  I don't have a problem avoiding fatty foods as I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables everyday.  Overall my diet is hella clean IMO.

I find the IF protocol to be extremely conducive to my productivity and lifestyle and makes calorie-restriction very

* **So anyway
* **Is this going to make fat-loss or muscle gain slower?**

PS: I have broken a month-long plateau with this IF/LG diet and have already lost a couple pounds at least in the past 2 weeks so I will surely be continuing.  **I'm just wondering how the protein/carb discrepancy is going to play out in the long run.  Thanks!**

ETA: In lieu of all the suggestions to eat more protein powder, I just wanted to say I don't eat those things because I simply don't enjoy them.  (I rather have nutrient-dense, ""real"" food with fiber any day over some protein powder.  You feel me?) I'm not against meat, although I'm not crazy about it.  I love the fat free Greek yogurt and eggs idea.  I thank ALL of you for the suggestions, it's much appreciated, however, **I would still want to know what the consequences are with my current diet more than anything else if anyone could speak from experience or point to articles.  And am I miscalculating carbs? Should I be looking at *Net* carbs [total carbs - fiber] and not total carbs? (Since I eat lots of fiber)**

------------------------------------------------------

___Thank you all for your responses___ 

ITT I Learned The Following Changes to make for rest days:

* My diet should be set up around my protein intake: ""Your thought about every meal should start with your protein source
* Eat more Eggs. 
* Get some 0% Fat Greek Yogurt.
* Low Fat Cottage Cheese is much cheaper though (I will mix in some blueberries and be in cottage cheese heaven).
* More meat/chicken/fish up in this bitch.
* Save the quinoa, legumes for workout-days (they're high in protein, low in fat, but high in carbs).

**edit:**
I've decided to keep up the -30/-10 for another week.  If I feel like I need more energy on workout days, and hopefully I can reach this goal by the end of March (6 weeks).

1350487794.0,11mtbq,5 Months of Bulking: Incredibly Slow Strength Gains. What Gives? ,frogpjb,25,8,21,"So I just completed 5 months of a slow bulk. I hate to give my life's story before I get to the meat of this post, my bench dropped 155-135

This May I began bulking. My 5 month anniversary, and I took some time to evaluate my progress.

Age: 19
Height: 5'11""
Weight: 156-167 (note that the first 4 lbs were a rapid water weight gain that happened over a week).
Body Fat: I have gained a small amount. Nothing horrible though.
Muscle: I guess it's been okay. I have put just under an inch on my arms

Squat 235-270 lbs (7 lbs a month gain)
Bench 145-165 lbs (4 lbs a month gain)
Press 110-125 lbs (3 lbs a month gain)
Deadlift 270-330 lbs (12 lbs a month gain)
Dips BW + 25-50 (5 lbs a month)
Chins BW + 2.5-30 (5 lbs a month)
I train in the 4-6 rep range for my top set
Note that given numbers are 5rms.

So from looking at this

**My Routine:**

Monday:
Squats 3 sets RPT
OHP 3 sets RPT
Front Squats 3x5

Wednesday:
Bench Press 3 sets RPT
Dips 3 sets RPT
Incline Pushups 3 sets
3 sets Tricep Extensions

Friday:
Deadlift 3 sets RPT
Chins 3 sets RPT
Rows 3 sets RPT
3 sets Curls

**Diet**: Still Following LG.

WO day :
3400 calories
240g protein
85g fat
430g carbs

Rest Day:
2600 calories 
215g protein
150g carbs
125g fat

I follow this pretty damn consistently and hit my protein goals 19/20 days and if I don't hit my calories its always from me going over my goals.

**Other Important Stuff**

I sleep about 7-8 hours a night. My numbers have basically remained the same for the past 1.5 month since I came to university. My first workout I had to drop weight by 5-10 lbs on every lift (especially upper body) and I couldn't do Deadlifts until I ordered some chalk since they didn't have it here. Since then I got my Squat up to 10 lbs above where I started when I came to school, but not much heavier. It also took me about two weeks to lock my diet in again with the switch to university food. 

I have another 5 months of bulking planned, on a damn cut, and I think my strength ought to be coming a hell of a lot faster than it is. How can I make this happen? Is my diet the issue? My training?

I've thought about this for a while and I honestly can't figure out the issue. I go as hard as I possibly can in the gym each workout and try my heart out to get more reps and use more weight. In my mind my diet and training routine are great. The only thing I can think of is that this summer and now I have a very exhausting life. This summer I worked a highly active outdoors job and was constantly doing stuff with my friends as well. Now at school I have classes from 9-6 3 days of the week and study from when I get back till midnight or later every night except Friday. Its probably worth mentioning I've been getting sick a lot more over the past 5 months than I used to as well. This is extremely frustrating. 

So

&gt; Carbs are an essential part of muscle building. Starchy carbs are great for building muscle. Read what Lyle McDonald says about that. Carbs can make you fat ... if you overfeed on carbs chronically (we are talking about 700g+ a day for many days).

In Lyle's article

Edit: what I've taken away so far: 

- protein after a workout is critical 
- replenishing glycogen stores after a workout is important
- to get protein into your muscle cells you'll need insulin 
- starchy carbs are a great source of glucose which spikes insulin and replenishes glycogen

I've lost a lot of weight just doing 20 minutes of exercise

So w/ lifting I'd like to do Chin-Ups, deadlift, dips, overhead press and calf raises.  Now is there any thing I need to add or take out?  Also I like the idea of doing RPT were you go 3-5 rep max then 6-8 then 8-12 if I understand that correctly.  

Now currently I weigh around 135 lbs and I think I'm around 12% BF.  I want my abs to show I want every thing to show so I'm assuming I need to be on a cut?  Now in terms of calories I've only been eating around 1300-1500 a day because I'm 5'4"".  I do eat 135G protein minimum every day and try to keep my fat around 40.  My fat some times is really low and my carbs have always been low

Snacks: maybe a cookie

* Should we really be looking at calories and macros on a daily basis or, but then are in deficit over a week, does it really matter if the calories on that workout day were comprised of more fat than the leangains approach suggests? Does the body react that quickly to excess calories from fat? 

The above is more in relation to recomp/cuts. Curious to hear your thoughts and as to whether you think  those with higher bf% (14% and above) would have more success keeping carbs lower at the outset (perhaps 150g max on workout days) and then gradually increasing carbs/decreasing fat intake on workout days as the trainee becomes leaner.

A bit of history about myself now, joined a gym and started doing squat, deadlift, chest press and pull ups 2-3 times a week and started to watch my macros.

I am now 139lbs and probably about 10-12% BF and waist is 29.5”.  I am so much happier with my body than I was this time last year.  My lifts have made slow progress while cutting but am now at a point where I am quite happy with my leanness (my Mrs says she doesn’t want me to lose any more weight!! So need to put on some lean mass before I lose more BF to keep her happy!! ;) ) 

So I am now going to do a -10/+25% for the next few weeks and see how I go if I don’t put on too much fat will raise to -10/+30%.  Macros are here: [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/4rQ1XvG.png[/IMG]

Been doing LG/IF for around 3 weeks, then bulk and cut after the summer.


**Weekly Schedule**

So I'm back on a 5x per week lifting schedule.  I actually do a 3 on, to 2 hours (I don't do any 'cardio' or running or anything like that, though I do play 10-20 hours of beach volleyball per week).  I know this is not necessary, and even slightly detrimental to a cut, but I do it because I love it.  My workouts are like therapy, and give me a sense of pleasure like no other!  An average week might look like this (yes I'm aware it looks like I do 6x a week because of the 3 on 1 off, but thats only week 1 that looks like that):

Workout day nutrition is obvious: eat most food post-workout and eat high carbs/low fat to produce a large insulin response for maximum transport of amino acids into cells/minimum transport of fats into cells.

Rest day nutrition is slightly more subtle in that a) carbs aren't very important and b) muscle synthesis peaks at 24 hours post workout. So eat a giant

So in a traditional MWF workout schedule, there isn't anything particularly important about Sunday. Sure, muscle synthesis may still be elevated from my massive squat workout on Friday, but is there any reason to not eat very little on Sunday? My feeding window is 1 PM - 9 PM; could I eat a 120 g/protein meal at 1:00 PM and fast until Monday at 1:00 PM?

Best mental / physical health I've ever experienced was when I didn't eat what I was supposed to, I tried to up the calories as many had told me to, but the more carbs I tried to fit in, the shittier I felt - enter LG and the actual -20/+20 recomp.

I've been doing SS (squats, chinups) on a -30/+10 cut for nearly a month now, but really have seen no weight loss according to numbers (fluctuates alot, but averages to 175).

Macros:
T day: P-158
R day: P-158

Chose sedentary and have consistently gotten in cardio at least 3x per week on rest days (30min of 10min/mile)

My lifts are increasing linearly still

Here is a current ref. photo:

EDIT: any body fat% guesses would be great too to help with the macro calculator

Any reassurances or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Basically I'm just wondering if it's possible that I'm gaining muscle rapidly enough to compensate for fat loss or if I need to recalculate TDEE or something.

So first off

**Stats**

(old stat/new stat)

Height:6'1

Weight:(204.6/185.2) bucknekkid

Bodyfat:(Unknown/17.2%) - note that i could be off about the bf

Waist: (37'/33')



**Lifts(old gains/new gains)**
Note that most of these gains are mostly due to muscle memory rather than anything else. Also

DB Bench Press(80x7/80x5-6)
DB Shoulder Press(50x6/60x6)
Box Squat(175x8/225x6)
Deadlift(175x7/245x6)Form improved also
I stopped doing pulldowns
Pullups(Bw x 3/BWx5-6)
Chinups(Bw x 2 or 3/BW x 7 or 8 not on a back day
Dips(BW x 9/ +25x8/+35x4-5)

So no real improvements when it came to my bench press or shoulder press. I'm doing OHP now

Supps
The only supplements I took were Jack3d for preworkout and Green Magnitude Creatine by Controlled Labs. I used those two from start of my log, I started taking a multivitamin and fish oil. I don't know if that contributed at all.

For the first 2 months, because my parents are celebrating ramadan and they think I am too(I'm not), so my whole eating schedule is fucked up. I pretty much did RPT on all of my lifts, unless it was accessory work. My lifting routine was just:

**Day 1:**

Box Squats

Calf Raises(acc)

HyperExtensions

Pullups


-

**Day 2:**

Bench Press

DB Press/OHP

Dips 


-

**Day 3:**

Deadlift

Kroc DB Rows

Chinups

Overall, and I at least got 200g's of protein. I also got most of my protein from whey shakes, which I didn't really enjoy. Hopefully when Ramadan ends I can buy a lot of meat for myself.

When I got my blood pressure checked I had been off my meds for 6 weeks and my blood pressure had dropped to 128/78 the lowest it has been in 7 years. This is still high but not enough to require medication so I have stopped needing my hypertension meds. In the past when I would go off my meds I would suffer headaches and my blood pressure would be 150/92. DO NOT GO OFF you meds without doctor approval. I have been monitoring my hypertension for ten years; the ability to stop taking meds was an unforeseen benefit of Leangains.

Jan. 1, 2012, it is my belief that even with my caloric restriction my body still acted like I was in a bulk state. My lifts and endurance increased throughout the 90 day period to April 1, 2012 as my lifts jumped significantly. Furthermore I was finally able to perform compound lifts in a fasted state. My weight did not drop as much as I expected but I lost over four inches of fat off my midsection. My strength and body stats as of April 1, 2012 are as follows:

Decided I was too lean to bulk and fatten back up to 10% (which involved a lot of alcohol and Nutella.  It was fun as hell
  
Finally, fatter, but not really any more muscular.  
  
I have lifted with different rep ranges
  
BTW

Nov 2010 164.1lbs, 8.4lbs bone - 6.1% body fat  
Deadlift: 275x4 (est 300x1)  
Squat: 240x6 (est 279x1)  
Bench: 225x6 (est 261x1)  
  
Feb 2012 185.0lbs, 8.5lbs bone – 16.5% body fat

Squat: 295x5 (est 332x1)

Body fat: +10.4%  
Deadlift: +66lbs (up 22%)  
Squat: +53lbs (up 19%)  
Bench: +26lbs (up 10%)  
  
Being stronger is nice.  I am way stronger and leaner than all my friends (even at 16.5% body fat).  However
  
If you are wondering how I can be stronger with such a tiny amount of lean mass gain it is because my central nervous system is stronger.  I pretty much have the same number of muscle cells/fibers as before
  
Lifting in the x5 rep range is supposed to improve strength.  Lifting in the x10 rep range is supposed to improve size.  I am going to cut back down to probably 8%-10% (which is going to suck because I am sure I am going to lose some muscle cutting).  I am also going to switch to lifting in the x10 range and hopefully gain some size.

Excerpts: 

&gt; Our main outcome was to look at the post-meal response for glucose and insulin. When I say post-meal, high fat meal and then we wanted to see how well the body responded over that remaining period. It was a five hour period - what we've found is that compared to the uninterrupted sitting, so when they sat all day, when we introduced the activity breaks, the response in terms of glucose and insulin was 30 per cent lower over that five hour period compared to the uninterrupted sitting.

Also interesting...

&gt; If you're somebody that sits all day but does 45 minutes of exercise before you go to work or after you come back


&gt; Yes - it appears to be independent of leisure time physical activity.

     MONDAY through SATURDAY
      4:00 AM   Wake up
      5:30 AM   Lift or run
      8:00 AM   Finish workout

    SUNDAY (Rest Day): Feed 10AM to 6PM

**Questions:**

* **Most important question:** Considering I do 3 days of lifting, what kind of calorie and macro split would you recommend for each type of day? I'm at a loss on this one...

* Due to schedule constraints

* Is not having BCAA's really that big of a deal? It sounds really gimmicky. If protein loss during post-workout fasting is really that big of a deal

* I'm concerned about hypoglycemia. I'm not diabetic or anything

* (Hypothetically

* I heard that having low insulin levels when sleeping (e.g. not eating before bed) helps keep growth hormones high during sleep

* Does the IF Calculator from the sidebar do all the math for me? Or is there other bro-algebra I need to know about?

* What else am I missing? Any problems stick out to you?

I would also like to add though people might downvote for this. 31mintues knows what hes talking about but he doesn't know everything. The main thing that I disagreed with him on is his view of bulking. He said that you shouldn't have to add any volume to the RPT routine for a bulk. If your main goal is strength gain choose a powerlifting routine based upon your lifts. RPT just isn't as good as gaining pure strength as a true powerlifting routine. I don't claim t be an expert but I know that the big powerlifitng routines are there because they work and most likely work better then RPT when on a bulk.

Doing the 16/8 split of fasting is now ingrained in me and is normal. I can go for hours past 16 hours fast and not feel hungry until I think about it. I started an **8 week cut** on June 1st. In addition to fasting I followed **Lyle McDonald's Ultimate Diet 2.0**. Now

**[After 8 Weeks relaxed and flexed at 172 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/VxWYZ)**

* **Conclusion**

I would  say that it was a successful cut and would definitely do it again. That being said

Every time I go to punch in a piece of somewhat fatty steak for supper or whatever, coming out to like, anywhere between 1000 and 1300 calories, depending on the size.

Heck, the calorie number is stupidly high. I've resorted to squeezing 90% of my food on rest days into one meal in the evening and just not counting calories. This meal is usually a 450g piece of ""fatty"" meat, some veggies cooked in coconut oil, and maybe a bit of fruit. My calories are clocking in at about 1500 for that one meal, but it just doesn't feel like 1500. I'm hungry again shortly after, and I wanna be like 'Arg! Fuck fatty meat. I'll just eat goddamn skinless chicken breast for every meal.'

Am I counting wrong, except fatty meat.

Monday:
Deadlift 2x5  *(158lbs/72kg)*
Overhead Press 3x8 *(41lbs/19kg per dumbell)*

It started when I was 1/4 of the way home in the car -- slight nausea, but it has always passed, so I assumed it would this time.  It got progressively worse as I got closer to home, and I actually had to pull over about 200 yards from being home and lay on the curb grass and call my other half to come get me with sodas and stuff (had no idea what the problem was, but thought this would help).  By this point, also had tingling in both my arms -- it was just like the kind you get when you feel the circulation isn't going so good because your lying in a weird position, only I wasn't.

I started feeling a bit better by the time my girlfriend showed up to get me (which my doc explained was because I was now lying instead of sitting), and my otherwise-normal pressure of 120/80 was 100/60 (no idea what it was while I was lying on the side of the road).  Per my doc, I'm on increased salt and fluid intake for now, but it is still taking time to rebound from this; 36 hours later, I still am feeling a bit messed up.

Extra info: I am type 1 diabetic, they were perfectly normal all throughout this episode.  It was warm here yesterday, but not *that* warm.  Also, I drank a fair amount of water at the gym.  I have been on a -30/-10 cut since the end of January with zero problems whatsoever.

Anyway,"" but I'm guessing there likely is some sort of dehydration/electrolyte imbalance going on here to cause all this.

I'm sure you all will laugh that I kept reassuring myself that everything was okay because, and nothing could take that away from me.

Just curious if anyone has experienced something similar to this, but I just don't want to under-react and pretend like nothing's wrong either.

**TL; DR:** Unsafe drop in blood pressure after DL made me sick

**EDIT, I've been cramming water, salt, and other fluids the best I can.  Also, I've let my diet relax, trying just to eat around maintenance and hit protein the best I can without going crazy.  I've gained 6 lbs. since this started, btw

I still feel weak and can't do very much, I am trying to get in to see my endocrinologist as soon as I can also.

1360577983.0,18aw6b,IF / LeanGains - How to start as very weak skinny-fat (??) guy?,LearPilot,16,2,38,"Hello together!

So after more or less unsuccessful attempts to significantly improve my body shape I would like to get some advice here. I stumbled upon the topics of intermittent fasting and leangains and hopefully can find something that works now.

**My data**
Age: 32
Height: 174 cm
Weight: 70.9 kg
[Photo](http://i.imgur.com/PZOSF7w.jpg)

I consider myself as somehow skinny-fat. If I hardly pull in my belly it looks like in the picture above. Normally my belly clearly stands out and no ripped structures are visible at all. So to be honest the photo above is a rather complimenting one

**My history**
Many years of fuckarounditis in the beginning without a clear concept and no complex barbell exercises

I then came across the book ""Beyond Brawn"" from McRobert and realized that I was basically doing EVERYTHING wrong: Too low squats with rounding back

**Current status**
After this complete ""reset"" mentioned above I continued to VERY slowly increase weights keeping good exercise technique.

The workout schedule is as follows: Monday: Squat, Standing Military Press - Friday: Chin-ups, Bench Press

Unfortunately I still struggle to see good progress. To give an example I will post some comparison values for my working sets:

August 2012: Deadlift: 3 x 8 with 61.5 kg - Squat: 3 x 8 with 45.0 kg - Bench Press: 3 x 8 with 50.0 kg

Today: Deadlift: 3 x 8 with 65.5 kg - Squat: 3 x 8 with 48.0 kg - Bench Press: 3 x 8 with 52.5 kg

So when checking these weight values for example on strstd.com or when reading on leangains.com I get the impression that these values are still ridiculously low. So there seems to be no ""newbie bonus"" anymore or something like that. I just don't get the weights up. Progress is rather tiny and it will take ages to even reach the intermediate level - this is my impression at least.

So what are your recommendations for me? Should I better go for a Big 3 session 3 days a week as recommended on rippedbody.jp to increase the much too low weights? I think this would be too hard

Should I stay with the split routine according to Beyond Brawn with tiny progress?

What IF routine do you recommend? I think Body Recomposition might be the right one.",,t5_2saqe,1360587825.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/18aw6b/if_leangains_how_to_start_as_very_weak_skinnyfat/

30% protein/20% fat/50% carbs on workout days.

**Goals:** Primarily weight loss. Strength gain would be nice, which seems like a reasonable goal to me. Slightly more difficult would be to hit the 200 mark by the time I graduate in mid-May. I’m new to this, so I have no idea if that would be possible or not.

**Questions:**

-I’m working out in the morning, but then don’t eat again until I’m home for dinner. Since I don't have the time or access to a kitchen during the day, it's much more convenient to have a smaller lunch and larger dinner. So how bad is it to have the second meal be the larger of the two? Not ideal but acceptable, or is it absolutely necessary to make my post-workout meal the biggest?

-On carbs, so where does pasta fall on the acceptable list? Is whole grain pasta a good enough compromise?

-I'm getting a lot of confusing/conflicting information on macros, is that much protein necessary? 585g (2.5x234) of protein seems like a totally impossible amount to eat.",,False,,t5_2saqe,False,,

I also plan to switch the Greyskull LP while on the bulk, do you modify the weight progression at all from the standard program?

Just wanted to share something I tried this weekend and get your thoughts on it.

I'm on a +7/-25 cut/recomp (yes I realize +7 is a weird number but for my TDEE it comes to approx. 2500 calories and I like that. And the -25 is what it's come to after some experimenting - it feels the most comfortable for a fairly large deficit).

So on to my experiment - I had a big workout on Friday at about 3pm after a 17hour fast. Managed to get 6x275lbs on my deadlift

On to part 2: Next day, stretching etc.,. And then I had one large meal Saturday night - about 1200-1400 cals, mostly protein and fat. My rationale for this is as follows: **I theorized that with my increased leptin levels due to my refeed, it would be a good time to do an extended fast with a lot of LISS to burn off a lot of fat**

So I don't know if it's because I wanted this to succeed, and my upper abs gained a lot of definition. I'm at about 11-12% bf right now so this is where I see the most of my improvements. I did my usual 16-hour fast on Sunday but didn't eat particularly well - had a couple of beers in the evening. Still as lean this morning.

So that was my experiment. I had the idea after doing some reading on Martin's blog and after I read the AMA by the div 1 soccer player a few weeks ago. I thought I'd post and get your thoughts on this - if any of you have tried anything like this or if any of you are willing to try and see what your experience is - that would be awesome.

I recently joined a gym that I love, who explained that I'm going to burn more body fat lifting weights than riding a bike going no where for hours. So, she gave me a basic weight training routine, and I've been following it two days a week, but have still been pretty heavy on the cardio the other 3 days I work out. 

So

1. The strength class was lifting free weights/body bars (anywhere from 7-12 lbs) and doing hammer curls, etc. Is this an okay place to start out? I'm still intimidated by the bench press, especially if I don't have anyone to spot me/ let me know if I'm even doing it right. 

2. The calculator said I need to eat something like 2200 calories since its my ""training day"". I'm really not sure I can eat that much, so just grabbing something quick and high-ish calorie is a little harder ( like pizza or a sandwich or something) 

3. About the early morning fasted training schedule- I know he recommends using BCAA to supplement. Unfortunately, so will whey protein work in the interim?

Started leangains on a -40/20 cut for 2 months, but I do eat low carb/ high fat on rest days and the opposite on workout days. I rarely meet my protein requirements since I have a hard time getting enough without shakes and plus I've been really enjoying the food I've been eating. For the most part everything is eyeballed and overestimated and since I've been continuing to see good results, I've left it that way. For the intermittent fasting I will do a 18/6 split on rest days and 20/4 on workout days due to extra time spent working out and cooking. I have also thrown in 40 hour fasts every month or so just to cleanse myself or if I feel if I had done too much damage that weekend with overeating and alcohol. I might throw in a few more 40 hour fasts before the end of June due Mexico trip/Bachelor party.

It lasts all day whether my wife gives me a massage or not.

I also feel extremely thirsty all day long and more tired.  I easily end up drinking 1.5 gallons of water total on these days.

The strange thing is that the only time I didn't feel this is when I took a product called supplement Phosphatidyl Serine (several brands available) that's typically used for memory help.  

I noticed that it was in a workout recovery product called AfterGlow.

I quit taking the supplement because it was kind of expensive.

I did change up the routine a little bit, which I will list below. 


Anywho I did about 2 weeks of a deload before, not wanting to give up. After about 6 weeks of upping weights my squat only went from 225x8 to 235x8. I was not too pleased strength wise, although I was bulking up pretty decent. And I know its Lyle's Generic ""BULK"" routine not strength so that's why I was kinda ok with that. But anyways so I decided I was gonna deload now and do another 6-8 week run at it before switching to a cut in about april. 


I just finished my deload and this is my 2nd week upping the weights... my squat is fucken terrible! after the deload I couldn't even get 225x6, and I barely made it out on my first rep! I Almost lost it on myself :p like wtf is going on, I feel like my squats are getting worse and worse, so I have come to my fellow leangainers to look for some help! I feel like my form is getting worse also, so im tempted to lower the weights to practise form again, but I don't wanna lose possible size progress in my legs from dropping the weight.

squat - 3 x 6-8
GHR - 3 x 6-8
leg ext - 2 x 10-12

I am currently eating 3225 cals, 40f on T days and 2200 cals, 200p, 110c, 105f on Rest Days. That was bringing my scale up at a slow rate but a constant rate, which I was happy with. I'm currently eating a bit over those cals now as to compensate for my weight gain so far.

I did a bit more digging around on this subreddit and saw a bunch of people saying that the 3g/kg proportion is way too much and should be aiming for ~1.8/kg instead.

As an athlete, you must TRAIN like an athlete.

This means blending various traits together

    *strength

    *speed / power

    *muscle building / functional hypertrophy

    *conditioning

    *fat loss

As you will see in your workouts

day where you mix all the aspects together and focus on having FUN

and simply being a “Soul Lifter” - training according to what you feel as natural

Your workouts will be organized into 4

workouts:

    *Hybrid / Freestyle / ""Soul Lifting""

    *Strength &amp; Speed

    *Muscle Building / Functional Hypertrophy

    *Conditioning / Fat Loss

On your “off / rest” days you can and should stay active through outside activities.

These activities can be your choice and will vary depending on time of year. For me they vary between playing basketball, running, and etc. The key is to remain active and open your body up to a wide spectrum of fun activities. 

(**Note: It would be wise to find time to stretch/and or do yoga. Reasons will be explained at the end.**)

************************************************************************************

Now

workouts

**1.Ladders - Perform the prescribed ladder reps while resting 30-60 seconds between each rep. As the reps climb, 2, 3. This means you would perform 1 rep, rest 30 seconds, 2 reps and rest 30 sec., and finally 3 reps followed by a longer rest period. This would be ONE ladder, and 4 more ladders would be left.**

************************************************************************************

**2.SubMax Effort (SM) - this means to NOT destroy yourself when performing the set

************************************************************************************

**3.Max Effort (ME) - This means you go ALL out and crush the last set

************************************************************************************

**4.Dynamic Effort (DE) - Perform each rep with maximum speed

************************************************************************************

**5.Grease The Groove (GTG) - With GTG you perform the exercise several times through the day for up to 2 weeks at a time (Or the prescribed length of time). Every set is performed with perfect technique/form and is NEVER taken to fatigue. GTG is excellent for improving strength and skill in body-weight movements that are challenging you.**

************************************************************************************

**6.Supersets / Circuits : Anytime you see A, no rest between each exercise. When you finish the last exercise in the sequence, then you can rest. Example = Set 1A) Set 1B)**
************************************************************************************
When performing weighted body-weight exercises
exercises in multiple ways: - Weight Belt - Weighted Vest - Weighted Back Pack - Chains

You can purchase weight vests or weighted belt with chains for strapping weights onto at your local fitness stores. These stores often have much cheaper prices than online stores and of course you skip the shipping charges as well.

I’ve even seen my fair share of people make their own weight vests or sometimes using a Back Pack loaded with magazines or small sandbags / wood pellets wrapped in contractor bags.

************************************************************************************

If you are new to body-weight training or perhaps body-weight training is your weakness

This will keep you focused on body-weight training and you can still perform any barbell movement *WITH* these workouts using the 5 x 5 method or Martin's prescribed Reverse Pyramid Training. Simply begin your workout with either and then move onto the calisthenic program you've designed for yourself.

There will be less variety in these body-weight workouts because we are more focused on increasing your strength and skill in the basic movements first and foremost. Continue with grip work at the end of at least 50 % of your body-weight workouts. My favorites are the basics

Weak Hands = Weak Man. Google for some grip exercises.

************************************************************************************

Use a simple notebook to track your workouts. Record the exercises

energy levels for the day. Look back on the workouts often and see if you’re

progressing. (&lt;--Just as Andy has suggested.)

NOTE: Make sure you do some sort of yoga/stretching when you can on off days

you do!

Also watch some YouTube body-weight training videos so you

understand how to properly &amp; safely modify an exercise if it’s too hard OR too easy for you.

I hope you enjoyed my post and comment/thumb up it if you like what you read.

May the gains be with you all!

(Currently I'm doing this style of training and noticed I'm getting stronger, vascular, and more muscular as well! Test, test, then retest things I always say! You never know if it will work if you don't try! Edit: Food for thought)

I have been doing Leangains for roughly a month now by slowly implementing it.  My questions are:

I can't seem to find many female success stories? Are there any women out there with success on Leangains? If so how long did it take and how did you implement it?

How low is too low in terms of macros and calories? If tracking them weekly - has intake spiked on training days and created a deficit on rest days? Or has it been consistent regardless?

Small meals or large meals? Is it right to assume that 2-3 larger meals in the feeding window is better in terms of reducing insulin increas versus spreading small meals out in the feeding window?

A journey indeed.

Currently, male, activity sedentary (10 hours a day sitting), IIFYM and IF scheduling.  I hit the gym four days a week (not in this order, but here's the outline):

* Chest/tri &amp; HIIT
* Back/bi &amp; HIIT
* Shoulders/abs
* Legs
* LISS
* LISS
* Full rest (daily activity only)

A little background: have been overweight my entire life and never had abs.  I also had barely any strength when I began the weight loss (followed by fuckarounditis for the first six months or so).  Beginning lifts to now (measured at approx 3x5):

* BENCH: 65lbs &gt; 135lbs
* SQUAT: Bar &gt; 155lbs
* OHP: 40lbs &gt; 80lbs
* DEADLIFT: 155lbs &gt; 205lbs

My lifts have 100% stalled and I am making zero progress with increasing numbers.  I expected this based on my sustained caloric deficit.  I do 16/8 IF, but finishing it since I paid for it).  Since I did IIFYM, I never really ""cheated"", but there were a few days I'd be off on my macros if I had a family dinner.  For instance, super high on fat and carbs/low protein, or any combination, however I tried to sustain my caloric requirements daily.  Never really had a refeed period/day or a blow-out day

I’m 24-years-old, and work-out as often as required (though I’ve read that 4 times a week is plenty). 

Using the Harris Benedict Formula, but I think the former category of ‘Moderately Active’ is more apt as I intend on doing 4 days of heavy weights per week.

To gain weight, I should consume 3525 calories on work-out days and 2441 calories on rest days. I picked Option 2 for weight gain, which was -10% maintenance calories on rest days and +30% maintenance calories on work-out days. [This is the macro-split I need to adhere to according to the calculator](http://i.imgur.com/FFUc3Is.png). 

Q1. Is it necessary to consume so many carbs? I've read that carbs don't do much for you apart from give you energy

Q2. Does the above macro-split and calorie consumption seem sensible? I'm going for a bulk but with as little fat gain as possible. 

**Weight-lifting**

There is so much information out there that I'm completely lost - could anybody please post up a work-out schedule that encompasses a full-body work-out and will result in lean gains and quality muscle. In short, Fridays and Sundays (with the days inbetween being rest days) - but I'm not sure what I should actually do on the work-out days e.g. arms? if so, which movements? etc. I will work out for 1hr each day.

My working and lifting currently looks like this.

* I get off work at 4pm and arrive home at 6pm, and begin lifting at 7pm.  
  
* After this I eat dinner around 8:30pm  
  
I lift Tuesday, alternating every 7 weeks. I also add in an additional shorter session during my lunch on Wednesday and Friday. These shorter sessions are designed to target a lagging muscle group (right now Wednesday is Forearms/Calves/Traps, and Friday is all Back).  
  
This means I lift at 7pm 3 days a week
  
How on earth am I supposed to time my meals? At first I thought I'd just skip that breakfast and fast from 8pm to 11am (which is ~15 hours) and have lunch, but that doesn't seem like accurate enough timing.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtgR-pQGNWuKdGZzTlRzTWp2S01zckdJa1ZqSU02Vnc&amp;usp=sharing

To use it: 

First

The **Weeks Breakdown** sheet is your workout for 4 cycles with breakdown by day and exercise. If it's a bar lift (e.g. deads) it'll subtract out the bar and split it up into plates. So a 205 dead looks like ""5@45,45,45,5.  I _think_ the math is working correctly, let me know if it's not. This spreadsheet uses a bit of Javascript so I'm not sure if that will translate over when you make a copy. Again, let me know. 

The **Sources** sheet is where you can add your own exercises and alter the progression numbers, use body weight and so on. 

Let me know if you have any improvements or see any problems. If you think I need to move some lifts to different days

**The way I use this**: print the breakdown sheet onto a single sheet of paper, cross off the days as you complete them or make notes. The paper should fold up so that one week will fit onto a 1/4 sheet of paper. 

Here's what's on the list already: 

------

Deadlift

Chinups (PF)

Overhead Press

Bench

Split Squats

Dips w/ weight

Plank w/ weight

Squat

Pull up (PA) w/ weight

LeanGains has treated me quite well. I've lost weight and gained significant strength. Granted, newish to squats) but I have been lifting for a couple of years so it's not like I'm a complete novice. After the adaptation the first 2 or 3 weeks, it's basically just been an increase in 1 rep or 1 set. 

These are the changes in strength for my top sets(I use RPT for everything except chins), deadlifting, and rowing heavy for about 4 weeks due to a silly lower back injury unrelated to my lifting, and spent about 2 weeks eating maintenance, without calorie cycling for recovery. Also, no cardio whatsoever.

Weights are in pounds

Bodyweight: 196-198 lb to 189 lb(Jan 31st). I instantly went up to 193 this week from starting to take creatine.

Deadlifts(3-5) -&gt; 225x5 -&gt;300x5

Seated OHP -&gt; 105x7 -&gt; 125x6

Bodyweight Chin-Ups 5 -&gt; 8

Bench 185 x 3 -&gt; 195 x 7

Pendlay Rows -&gt; 120 x 6 -&gt; 125 x 8

Close Grip Bench -&gt; 120x7 -&gt; 150x8

Squat -&gt;185x5 -&gt; 195x6

Close Grip Barbell Curl -&gt; 55x6 -&gt; 70x7

Of course, squats, and chins had been stalling the past couple of weeks, and my lower back felt like it never recovered adequately. Thus, I dropped the Close Grip Bench Press and Barbell Curl, and decreased OHP and Rows(now chest supported T-Bar Rows) to just 2 sets. I did this last week and all of my strength stats went back up.

Ok so here goes...


I decided early 2012 to get my s*** together and lose some weight. Im not a tall guy (5'7"") but i had accumulated a lot of weight from my mad weekend alcohol binges.

I started going to the gym (with major fuckarounditis) for about 3/4 months but eventually fell out of the habbit as I hadn't really any specific goals. Summer came and passed along with holidays and I hadnt noticed much difference.



So i decided to do Insanity ( I used to be very active so I thought i'd be able for it). So I completed that (with calorie deficit) and lost a good bit of weight

The last 3/4 weeks of Rushfit, i lost a chunk of fat of my belly and now fit into trouser size (30"") I haven't fit into in years (i'm 25 next week) and even that's beginning to loosen :)



Now however, not sure about bf% ???



So my question is:
- should I now start at the gym tomorrow morning with proper leangains methods (carb&amp;cal cycling



PS. If I cut

There are some LG-compliant, though.

One idea I've seen (that I haven't figured out yet) is Protein Popcorn.  The recipe I came across suggested bulk kernels microwaved in a paper bag, but it's my own preference to cut out unnecessary macros on days I'm not supposed to have them, since I find that I too easily exceed my off-macro on a given day with incidental sources (veggies on rest days, fat from chicken on workout days, etc.).  Even though I followed the recipe, though, and used the specified amount of oil

Another thing I'd love to perfect is LG-style no-bakes/pro-bakes.  No-bakes are my **favorite** cookies

So those are the types of things I'm interested in.  I'm imagining snacks that are a little more complicated than, of course, the shit).  Here are some other guidelines that it would be nice to meet:

I mainly find myself wanting these things at work

A couple weeks ago I thought I'd struck gold when I started trying all the various artificial sweeteners that exist (Equal and Splenda being the tastiest for me), even though I love plenty of soy things).

I just bought a candy thermometer recently, and all I've used it for so far is making homemade yogurt (bloody brilliant success, that, but I've eaten so much of it that maybe that's why I'm looking to branch out, so the difficulty/elaborateness of a given recipe isn't a problem.

I don't have a gym nearby so I can only work out from home. I've been training with an RKC kettlebell instructor and so far it has been great. I went from about 230lbs, basically by following a fairly low carb Paleo diet and by doing kettlebell work-outs 3 times a week (and sprinting once a week) + 16/8 Intermittent Fasting. I recently got a pull-up bar and I use that regularly as well now (I can only manage about 6 chin ups in a row, quite poor but before I couldn't do a single one).
I've been reading quite a lot about the Leangains protocol and it all makes sense to me. I like Martin's scientific and no-nonsense approach. The question is: are kettlebell work-outs heavy enough to be compatible with LG? I have a 16kg and 24kg kettlebell and usually do swings, swings, squats and get-ups are recommended in the kettlebell world to achieve general strength and conditioning.
I've been experimenting a bit with LG and have been upping my carbs and calories on work-out days (usually potatoes, but that is tough as I'm so used now to eating fatty food). One thing it has taught me already is embrace the carbs on work-out days as I have so much more strength than before. Low carb helped me shed the initial fat, but I feel I need to start transitioning now.

Deads: 175lbs/240lbs

All of the above are my working sets, my original body fat percentage was estimated to be 20%, but honestly that was a more or less wild guess. One of my next steps is to pay for some kind of measurement to get an accurate number on that.

Things that I've learned / that have happened:

1. I had to quit running because it was interfering with my recovery. Now that my form is getting better, I quit smoking at the start of keto (Almost 5 months now!) so it is really important to me to maintain cardiovascular health. I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate it into my program, but I assume I'll just have to carefully compensate for the calories burned.

2. I don't know if it's psychological, and having to deload because of degradation in form. This time, I seriously felt perfect at 185 and was able to crank out 3 sets of 5 easily, but at 190 it was like I'd tripled the weight. Anyone have any insight on that?

3. I have cheated. A lot. I try to compensate for it either that day, so I thought it would help for me to do the same, and I've chosen to consciously focus on strength gain for now. Still, I find myself feeling much more comfortable erring on the side of fewer calories than more, and I still mildly panic when day-to-day water weight fluctuations put me over 145lbs. This is something I'll work on from here.

In terms of progressing, but I still have a decent amount of fat I can burn before I feel that any sort of bulking is appropriate or necessary.

Fat: R 80 T 40 (approx)

Protein: R 183 T 183

Carbs: R 30 T 340 (approx)

Hour Breakdown: Eat 2pm-10pm (usually 2 meals per day

Your Training History: 3 years on/off (bordering on fuckarounditis)

Your Program: RPT m/w/f evenings following one pre workout meal (roughly 20% daily intake)



I'm currently 4 weeks in and 3kg down with no noticable muscle or strength loss. I was previously on a typical bb bulking diet eating 5-6 times a day with protein/mass shakes. Now I eat all whole foods with no shakes and i feel much better in terms of general mood



My current goal is to cut down to a stage where i can begin recomp (i.e 12% bf) whilst maintaining muscle/strength hence a 30/10 setup.



I work 9-5 and train in the evenings from 6-7pm. Workouts revolve around compound moves in a RPT setup



Mon - Deadlift (4/5/6) 100kg -10/20%


Wed - BB Bench Press (4/5/6) 92.5kg -10/20%


Fri - Squats (4/5/6) 110kg -10/20%



This is only my second week of RPT following a 3x8 split routine using mostly compounds so I'm still getting use to the setup/weight.



In conclusion the first month has been a good experience with noticable fat loss (3kg), but now i sail through to 2pm with just black coffee/water in the morning.



Sometimes i find it difficult just consuming 1600 calories on rest days whilst getting the protein/fats i require but using an app like myfitnesspal (highly recommended for anybody trying to count calories/macros) makes it more managable. Training days are easy to get calories/macros in and sometimes I add a treat but generally eat clean on both days (have always eaten clean).

The context was that a new ""LG"" dieter was asking for advice about whether integrating a solid ""conditioning"" (read: running) program into a lifting regimen was a LeanGains-approved idea. A vocal member of this community was arguing that Berkhan 'advocated' HIIT cardio for fat loss

Frankly

---

I'll come out swinging: cardiovascular conditioning and strength training are not hand-in-hand goals, LG itself has no claims to being a 'good' program for cardio training and there's no reason to think its macro recommendations, fasting windows and meal partitions are ideal or even useful for cardiovascular training. Some stuff to chew on in the debate:

* [A nice post from a while back on bb.com summarizes Berkhan's recommendations vis-a-vis cardio](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=131542323&amp;p=638829893&amp;viewfull=1#post638829893):

&gt;I am in disagreement with Tom's cardio recommendations and consider them counterproductive. Especially if used in the context mentioned in the book. After weights

Translation: Cardio after weight training is not recommended.

&gt; Add cardio or whatever else to get your energy expenditure up. A personal favorite of mine is lower intensity and longer duration activities like walking in the 12-16 hour time interval of the fast. Not only is this the ""golden age"" of subcutaneous fat oxidation

Translation: If you must do cardio, and **not HIIT**.

&gt; Elevated levels of cortisol can cause water retention, and low calorie intakes increases cortisol... Only do low intensity steady state cardio, such as walking or similar activities with a low perceived rate of effort.

Translation: Only do LISS such as walking or similar activities. The exertion should be far below the threshold of endurance athletics.

&gt;Some people rely heavily on cardio in order to maintain their leanness. This allows them to be somewhat more lenient with their diet. I am however no fan of cardio and don't use it to stay lean. In my view cardio as a strategy to maintain a low body fat percentage is not only time-consuming

Let's repeat it for emphasis: **I am no fan of cardio and don't use it to stay lean**. LeanGains is first and foremost a diet and strength training protocol

Now

&gt; Never attempt to train yourself into a caloric deficit. Don't spend hours on the treadmill. Diet comes first, but most people use cardio as a fat loss tool - and force themselves through regimens that aren't very conducive to their daily routine (or mental sanity). Next time, skip the shake and the cardio. Sleep two hours longer, but skip breakfast and fast until lunch time. This way you can create the same caloric deficit with the added bonus of feeling more rested and having saved more time. You'll be much better off.

* [Berkhan responded to this post directly and outlined his reasons for his recommendations](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=131542323&amp;p=639771283&amp;viewfull=1#post639771283). 

I won't repeat these here, and doing both vigorously at the same time will get you less progress than choosing either separately. (This 'interference' phenomenon is more true of strength training than cardio, incidentally; but cardio is *not* a priority in LG.)

---

So all of this begs the question: is cardio consonant with LeanGains? Considering that LeanGains is a protocol explicitly for strength and mass athletes or people interested in body recomposition, a little back-door has been thrown in there to accommodate all the cardio junkies of the world by explicitly approving LISS cardio *at the intensity of walking*. This back-door, however, should not be abused as a wedge to accommodating all sorts of other activities--as it often is.

Now: can cardio ""work"" on LG? If you take ""work"" to mean ""Will I make progress in my workouts?"", there's lots of reasons to think you will actively harm/make mediocre progress in your strength training/body recomposition efforts. (See the 2nd link for a few reasons for this.) And if your primary goals aren't strength or mass building or body recomposition, then why the hell are you doing LG?

...

Which takes us to the million-dollar question: if not LG

1376458668.0,1kbyo7,[Progress; beg. of Week 1] Introduction &amp; my leangains experiment,amerikant,14,1,6,"Hi everyone

Longtime lurker here, how to count macros, etc. after having finally read the FAQ and guides. I've been involved in athletics all of my life, have an extensive background in lifting, martial arts and other sports, but have never, and I mean never, however, another day 22:2

I will track my progress for 30 days “ending” on Sept. 12th. I'll post once near the beginning of each week (this post essentially doesn't count)

**Here's the catch**: I'm in Ecuador at the moment with no access to a gym

On my workout days (5 days) I will be doing: 

* ~~at the very least 550 pushups (the majority of them are on my finger tips or knuckles) in a mixture of 50,~~ but I am limited because of a level 2 AC joint separation from a bicycling accident;

* ~~at least 100 air squats in a mixture of 25, and sometimes resisted with a band;~~

* ~~resistance band training to help rehab my shoulder;~~

* an intensive stretch routine that lasts for a minimum of 45 minutes;

* and a variety of slow martial arts movements i.e. holding static stances

On my rest days (2 days) I will still perform ~~air squats, but instead will bring down the # of pushups to 250, no more and no less.~~

Everyday I'll be briskly walking an average of 2 miles.

Also please consider that I'm recovering from a second right knee ACL tear (first time was a full tear from American football, operated Apr. '13), as well as a [**deep laceration worth 14 stitches**](http://imgur.com/oiX4FRr) **[graphic]** on the same goddamn knee (operated Oct. '13) from the same goddamn bicycling accident that injured my shoulder. I also caught an inguinal hernia on my right side in Mar. '07 and had it operated on Jan. '08, so that's yet another injury that I have to constantly be wary of.

**Here are my stats**:

* 22y/o male

* 5'8”

* 149.8lbs (as of Sept. 12th)

* Body fat % is unknown **(do y'all have any estimates for me based on pics?)**

* Waist is 31.98 measured at its girthiest

In the IF Calculator I put “moderately active” **(do y'all think this is appropriate or should I insert “lightly active” instead?)**, and a **25/75** split...

* Rest days: **107**g carbs

* Workout days: **465.4**g carbs

* Week calories: 18

* Week TEE: 17

* TDEE: 2578

~~TBH I don't think I'll be able to hit my carbs on workout days (definitely not calories), but seeing that I'm trying out lean massing, I'll try my best to eat more. Also worthy of notation is that I don't hesitate to regularly hit upwards of 200-225g of protein because fresh fish and lean meats are so cheap here.

Please, experience, suggestions and especially criticism you have for me; and also feel free to **a**sk **m**e **a**nything!

Here I am: [**relaxed**](http://imgur.com/C4TJ2gr), [**good leg**](http://imgur.com/g6EVs0W), [**chicken knee**](http://imgur.com/3zwDAw0) and [**good knee**](http://imgur.com/rLOBCUh).

Again, since this post doesn't count, I'll be posting again at the beginning of next week titled ""[Progress Week 1]"" and it'll include daily exercise regime and macros.

Looking forward to your responses and meeting all my fellow hungry artists! As a token of my appreciation, trust me, you'll eat it up.
