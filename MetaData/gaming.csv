1339494005.0,uxpil,I've been playing the same game of Civilization II for almost 10 years. This is the result. ,Lycerius,48520,36460,3663,"http://imgur.com/a/rAnZs

I've been playing the same game of Civ II for 10 years. Though long outdated, but I often return to this game when I'm not doing anything and carry on. The results are as follows. 

- The world is a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation.

- There are 3 remaining super nations in the year 3991 A.D

-The ice caps have melted over 20 times (somehow) due primarily to the many nuclear wars. As a result

-As a result

-Only 3 super massive nations are left. The Celts (me), we have conquered all the other nations that have ever existed and assimilated them into our respective empires. 

-You've heard of the 100 year war? Try the 1700 year war. The three remaining nations have been locked in an eternal death struggle for almost 2000 years. Peace seems to be impossible. Every time a cease fire is signed

-Because of SDI

-The only governments left are two theocracies and myself, I was forced to do away with democracy roughly a thousand years ago because it was endangering my empire. But of course the people hate me now and every few years since then, there are massive guerrilla (late game barbarians) uprisings in the heart of my empire that I have to deal with which saps resources from the war effort.

-The military stalemate is air tight. The post-late game in civ II is perfectly balanced because all remaining nations already have all the technologies so there is no advantage. And there are so many units at once on the map that you could lose 20 tank units and not have your lines dented because you have a constant stream moving to the front. This also means that cities are not only tiny towns full of starving people

-My goal for the next few years is to try and end the war and thus use the engineers to clear swamps and fallout so that farming may resume. I want to rebuild the world. But I'm not sure how. If any of you old Civ II players have any advice

Edit: -Wow guys. Thanks for all your support. I had no idea this post would get this kind of response. 
       -I'll be sure to keep you guys updated on my efforts. Whether here on Reddit
       -Turns out a whole subreddit has been dedicated to ending this war. It's at /r/theeternalwar

[Uncharted 2 (178 mins)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfAkg0s7_iA)

[Uncharted 3 (196 mins)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgDq64ATsmU)

The Uncharted games are personally my favorite series of games, and I agree with both of those things. That gave me the idea to edit these games into movies. That way I would be able to watch the story of these games in one sitting easily, and without having to take up a considerable portion of my day. Not only that, but I would be able to show these to people who either don't have a PS3, don't have or want these games but still are interested in seeing the story, or even don't play video games at all. 

With these projects I was trying to make movies that would be viewable whether or not you had played the game, button prompts, and more to make it seem less like a video game. There were certain aspects I wasn't able to remove, such as the current weapon selected, or an occasional button prompt. I tried to focus mostly on the cinematics, but also include the minimum amount of gameplay to link them, especially focusing on the more cinematic elements of gameplay. I wanted to make sure not to cut any cutscenes or any gameplay that would leave the viewer confused if they hadn't played the game, but that's just because the stories are much more complicated than Uncharted 1's. Either way it's still a lot shorter than playing the real game, or if you want to show these games' stories to friends or family that don't care about playing video games. 

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Yeah, about 11 months ago. [G4TV came next](http://www.reddit.com/domain/g4tv.com/?count=300&amp;after=t3_cg8ek), about 9 months ago. And [GamrFeed most recently](http://www.reddit.com/domain/gamrfeed.vgchartz.com/?count=50&amp;after=t3_f3bfz), about 4 months ago.

Now, most seem to comment a decent amount along with their submissions. However, pay attention to *which stories* they're commenting on (mouse over the titles in their user page and check the domain), it's almost always ones that one of the other accounts submitted, and usually with a very short, generic comment that wouldn't take any time to think of, or write. This is just another way of making their submissions seem more ""active"" when they're pushed up. Some of the comments are on real submissions, and just uses the last account they were logged into from their spamming. Going through and getting full statistics of every account's comments seemed a little unnecessary

While looking through comments, so this may be a clue as to who's behind them.

Mods, everyone, please downvote any submissions from these sites with extreme prejudice. They've been heavily abusing the system for months, and don't deserve any more traffic from reddit.

Some of you may remember me from the [Uncharted movie trilogy I made last year](http://redd.it/sm2nf). This year I've been hard at work editing the Assassin's Creed series into movies. I tried to keep them as short as I could, and making them any shorter than I did would sacrifice that storytelling imo.

I'm planning on making more movies in the future. The next movie I plan to do is the new Tomb Raider game. However, but you can suggest others here if you wish.

I also recently bought an HD capture device, and perhaps I will be able to remake my Uncharted movies in HD eventually as well. I plan to make AC4 when it comes out, and will likely be using the PS4 version, as it will likely allow me to capture at a higher resolution than I was capable of doing on the PC. I could have captured at 1080p, but it caused major frame rate lag. I'm assuming this has more to do with hard drive access than my CPU's capabilities, so capturing from an external device would solve this problem, although an SSD may fix it as well. However, it did dip below 24fps in a few spots

1351884224.0,12j1jn,I do graphics programming in games. This is everything you need to know about mirrors in games.,ExpiredPopsicle,14296,11638,1006,"/r/gaming

But first! Let's talk about performance

(Warning: Holy crap this is a lot of text. I'm so sorry.)

**Fill rate**

Fill rate is how fast your GPU can calculate pixel values. At its simplest, like texture fetches, texture cache performace, blah blah blah). It's also (often) the biggest factor in GPU performance. Adding a few operations to your fragment shaders slows it down by a multiple of how many pixels use that shader.

For a deferred shading engine (like what they use in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and the newer Unreal engines), and you hopefully end up drawing each pixel on the screen once - plus the lights, which are drawn after the objects.

For a forward rendering system, and doing somewhat costly queries to the scene graph to see what lights affect the object before rendering. The information about the lights is sent to the shader when the object is drawn, instead of after.

Many engines use hybrid techniques, using traditional forward-rendering techniques. Alpha objects are also often sorted back-to-front so they render on top of each other correctly.

What does this have to do with mirrors? Well

http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter09.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillrate

**Vertex and face count**

Each vertex runs through a vertex shader. These can be quite complex because they are generally expected to run for fewer objects than the fragment shaders. In these

Skinning also happens there. That is, rendering characters becomes much more costly than rendering static level geometry. There are other factors that differentiate characters and dynamic objects from static objects too, affecting vertex shader complexity.

**Draw calls**

There's also an amount of overhead associated just with the act of drawing an object to the screen.

The rendering API (DirectX or OpenGL) has to be set into a different state for each object. It ranges from little things like enabling or disabling alpha blending to setting up all your bone matrices in a huge buffer to send to the graphics card along with the command to render the model. You also set which shaders to use. Depending on the driver implementation and the API

For example, but I wouldn't push it. (DirectX 10+ and OpenGL do not suffer from overhead that's nearly that extreme.)

When you draw the scene for the flipped point of view of the mirror

TL;DR: The number of THINGS you draw to the screen is just as important

http://members.gamedev.net/jhoxley/directx/DirectXForumFAQ.htm#D3D_18

**Skinning information is huge**

Oh yeah. That huge buffer of fifty-something bones I mentioned? That's a big thing to cram into your rendering pipe. When drawing a character

(Each bone needs at least a 3x4 matrix associated with it, this starts adding up.)

**How games used to do it**

Games such as ~~Doom~~, and (maybe) Marathon used what was called a ray-casting engine. For each column of pixels on the screen, a line was sent out from the virtual eye of the character. Any wall it hit would be rendered, and the scale of the column of pixels for the wall would be determined based on how far away it was.

Okay

A mirror is extremely simple to implement in this type of engine. Once you detect that the line has hit a mirror surface

~~Duke Nukem 3D had some other limitations that came into play that required them to have big empty areas behind mirrors. I can only assume this was due to some limitation in their character and sprite drawing rather than the walls and floors themselves.~~

NOTE: ~~RayCASTING and rayTRACING are two different things. Raytracing works for each pixel. I'll discuss raytracing later.~~

EDIT: As a few people pointed out, ""raycasting engines"" are commonly the 2.5D variety I specified.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting

TL;DR: When /u/drjonas2 said in his post ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12gvsn/as_somehow_who_works_on_video_games_seeing_all/ ) that reflecting Duke Nukem in Duke Nukem 3D was easy

**How some games do it now**

* Portal

Portal just renders the game world again on the other side of the portal. It's also a game with extremely limited complexity in rendering. Only a single character, and (IIRC) only a single directional light that casts shadows. Using it as a benchmark to judge games with more complicated rendering requirements is ridiculous. Stop doing that. You look really dumb when you do that.

* Fake reflections

Shiny materials can give a good impression of reflecting the environment without actually reflecting the environment. This is often done with a cube map. It's basically just six square shaped textures arranged like a box. We can sample pixels from it with x,y. To visualize what it's doing, imagine a box made up of the six sides of the texture, facing inwards. You are inside the box. You point in some direction indicated by the vector x,y,z. The pixel you're pointing at is what we return, blended with the rest of the material in an appropriate way

This lets us have a pre-rendered reflection for the scene. It won't cost a whole lot of extra rendering time like it would to constantly re-render the scene for a reflection

If you aren't going for a perfect mirror

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping

**Render-to-texture versus not render-to-texture**

For those who are okay dealing with the limitations of just rendering the scene to another texture and dealing with the extra draw calls, and all the other stuff that goes with drawing most of your scene twice, there are still limitations to drawing to a texture and plastering that texture on something.

First

So what do you do? A lot of games just dispense with the texture and have an identical area on the other side of the mirror

Obviously it's nice if you can do that with some kind of scene graph hack instead of building it into the level data. Maybe a node that just references the root level with a transformation to invert across the mirror axis. Otherwise you're going to subject your level designers to some pain as they try to justify a big inaccessible area in their building that they used for the mirrored area (Duke Nukem 3D had big empty areas behind mirrors

**All of this is for flat mirrors only**

Oh yeah. All of this won't work if you want a curved mirror. Fake cube-map reflections work of curved surfaces

**Not really worth it**

Another reason you don't see too many perfect mirrors in games is that it doesn't really justify the effort that goes into it. You might be surprised to know this, that's neat"" and then move on to actually play the game. A game company's graphics team can usually spend their time better by fixing bugs and adding more useful features than something that most people will - at best - think is mildly interesting.

Keep in mind the context I'm assuming here is for FPS games. For the Sims

Given all the time in the world

**Raytracing is not a magic bullet**

Raytracing engines have no problem with mirrors

EDIT: See note about me mincing words above concerning raycasting vs. raytracing.

However, Unreal Engine, and others.

There's no argument that rasterization techniques are hacky and complicated by comparison, and trying to get them to look as pretty as the other devs' games, while still keeping a decent framerate.

EDIT:

**TL;DR**: I refer back to /u/drjonas2 's post: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12gvsn/as_somehow_who_works_on_video_games_seeing_all/

EDIT:

Doom used a different rendering system involving BSP trees. Woops.
Duke used something else too.

EDIT: Fixed some minced and misused terms.

1370743130.0,1fyjgr,Regarding XBox One and Allegations of Vote-Rigging,airmandan,6296,3680,1421,"Gaming community

As you are no doubt aware

Yesterday, and alleged that during a visit to Microsoft's Redmond campus, she overheard Microsoft employees discussing content they had posted on behalf of their employer to ""pics and gaming,"" and that she witnessed one of these employees mass-downvoting reddit content.

This provoked a **HUGE** thread that quickly spiraled out of control, we were forced to step in and end the thread, as this kind of behavior violates the [Rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) regarding vote manipulation.  Further, some people had become so angry at the allegations of corporate interference that personal information (dox) of people accused of having any affiliation with Microsoft—proof or not—was getting posted.

At this time, and I would like to do so now.

1. In the original post that set off the entire firestorm

1. In the comments on that post, and alleged that this PR firm was ""really trying to ramp up their presence on blog sites and Reddit in particular.""

1. I have since communicated with Peter Wootton, and as such that individual would have no knowledge of any of the operations of that firm.  I reviewed the data he sent me and found it compelling enough to assert that it is true and correct.

1. I asked Mr. Wootton the following questions
*Is your firm now, contractors, volunteers, or associates to post, comment, and/or vote on content for or on behalf of any company, firm, firm, or associates to post

1. His response appears below:  
*Totally fair question

1. Mr. Wootton has agreed to participate in this thread and answer questions you might have about his firm and their relationship with Microsoft.  His username is /u/petewootton.  I know many people will have an initial instinct to distrust and downvote, after all, has provided proof of who he is and what he does, something the original poster making the allegations completely failed to do.

1. Let's reiterate that last bit there.  The original allegations that Microsoft was engaged in manipulating this community **did not come with any proof** and the person who chimed in to back up those allegations (see point #2 in this list) **has been proven false**.

1. Let's also look at it from a pragmatic standpoint.  If Microsoft *was* trying to manipulate /r/gaming, for the last 24 hours, has consisted entirely of memes making fun of Microsoft and the XBox One.

When you add all this up, we have been trolled**.  A zero-day account showed up with a lot of claims and no proof, but knew all the right things to say to rile up the community in their revulsion for both the XBox One and corporate interference in our free community.  The post was *explicitly designed* to trigger rage at heavy-handed and Orwellian tactics, and it did exactly that.

Unfortunately, they found themselves at the receiving end of dox dumps, threatening PMs, and crowds of downvote brigades annihilating their user account all over reddit.

Friends, type a couple paragraphs, and get a three-million-strong pitchfork mob going for funsies and lulz.  When someone comes along with claims like that, we should take a cue from /r/IAmA — ask for proof.  *Demand* proof.  If we had done that in the beginning, we'd have quickly found out the whole thing was a fake, and saved this community from the last day full of headache and front page shenanigans.

In the end, because we sure as shit delivered one hell of a show.

We can do better than that.  We owe it to ourselves to do better than that.  I hope

You’ve probably heard that Demon’s Souls is hard. Pshh. Lots of games are hard. Some are even harder than this one. The difficulty is not the point. What sets Demon's Souls apart is the way that it doesn't just kill you

It’s a lot like life. Sometimes in life you win, asshole. You go back to the beginning of the level, leaving all your hard-earned souls out there on the pavement, and you fight your way back. And you learn a lesson from the whole thing, because you should have been wearing your Thief’s Ring, now shouldn’t you? That’s life.

The trend in hard games these days is to unlock “Easy” mode for you once you’ve died enough times. Do you think Demon’s Souls does that? Do you think Demon’s Souls is so much as aware of the concept of “Easy” mode? NO IT IS NOT. If Demon’s Souls even knew we were talking about “Easy” mode

I’ll tell you what happens in Demon’s Souls when you die. You come back *as a ghost* with your health **capped at half**. And when you keep on dying, it gets **harder**. Why? Because fuck you is why.

Have I told you about the online elements? At any time when you’re in Body form, you cannot opt out of this feature! This is what you signed up for when you agreed to be a **man**.

When this happened to me -- when a guy strolled into my game like it was Taco Bell and exploded my torso

Now, and the greater the challenge, the greater the glory.

Always online doesn’t bother me. I’m already always online. 

Not buying preowned doesn’t bother me – I always buy new and never trade my games in. 

The Kinect doesn’t bother me because I have the ability to realise I already own half a dozen devices with the ability to listen in/see what I’m doing – including one with a built in GPS that I carry with me everywhere I go. I also realise that if I’m worried about privacy

But you know what does bother me? Your utter contempt for me. Your lack of focus on me as a gamer. Your failure to recognise that your draconic DRM systems are punishing *me*, then I shouldn’t want a next generation system. 

So despite the fact that not one single thing you are doing would really inconvenience me personally

Sony is bending over backwards to give gamers everything they have ever asked for. We don’t know if they’ll deliver – but they’re a lot more likely to deliver on a promise they’ve made than you are on one you haven’t. 

As a gamer who has *never* owned a Sony console, matching each other’s promises and method to try and outdo one another and capture the gaming audience. 

But no. I look at you and I see a company that says “Oh you want to play games? FINE. But you do it how WE SAY!”. I look at Sony and they’re telling me “Hey, everything you’ve asked us for.. no really, everything. All of it.”

This is a message from a gamer who has actually been supporting you all this time – in fact take a stroll through my post history and you will SEE me defend you.

But I’m getting tired of it. I still want to buy the Xbox One.. but the people pushing me away aren’t fanboys or your competition.. it’s you. Because so far

I think that should worry you.
