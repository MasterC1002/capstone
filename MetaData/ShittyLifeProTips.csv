1361202535.0,18r65r,SLPT: How to avoid getting a ticket when pulled over,chb1000000,253,27,15,"Getting pulled over is never fun.  Remember

* Police officers hate messy cars.  The officer has no way of knowing what kind of weapons or drugs could be underneath your old Wendy's bags, and general filth.  As soon as you see the lights go on behind you, make a strong effort to straighten up your car.  Start stuffing all the junk under the seats, into the console, or even out the windows if you have to.  The officer will appreciate your tidiness.

* Immediately get out of the car once stopped.  This will let the officer know that you don't intend to pull a weapon out from between the seats.  Immediately approach the officer's cruiser.  This will let the officer know that you are eager to discuss the matter.

* Be friendly with the officer.  This can have a profound psychological effect on the officer, the cop will subconsciously treat you as a friend.  Is the cop a big man?  Then his friends probably call him ""Big Guy"" or ""Thickness"" or ""Pork Chop.""  You should call him that, too.  A lady officer?  Try calling her ""Honey"" or ""Hot Stuff.""  This will get the cop on your side.

* If the above three tips fail to get you out of trouble, you cannot legally be expected to pay it.  Do not sign the ticket.  Do not accept the ticket from the officer's hand.  If the officer puts it into your car, throw it back out and drive away.

&gt;	**Guide for Americans Visiting the UK**

&gt;  	Author: Jo Miller 	 
  	  	 
&gt; **Language:** The Brits have peculiar words for many things. Money is referred to as “goolies” in slang

&gt; The English are a notoriously demonstrative, but only between people of the same sex.

&gt; **Habits:** Ever since their Tory government wholeheartedly embraced full union with Europe, which they call a “wank.” As this is still a fairly new practice in Britain, it is not uncommon for people to oversleep (alarm clocks, alas, do not work there due to the magnetic pull from Greenwich). If you are late for supper, simply apologize and explain that you were having a wank – everyone will understand and forgive you.

&gt; **Universities:** University archives and manuscript collections are still governed by quaint medieval rules retained out of respect for tradition; hence patrons are expected to bring to the reading rooms their own ink-pots and a small knife for sharpening their pens. Observing these customs will signal the librarians that you are “in the know” – one of the inner circle, it is customary to kiss the librarian on both cheeks when he brings a manuscript you've requested, a practice dating back to the reign of Henry VI.

&gt; **Sightseeing:** One of the most delightful ways to spend an afternoon in Oxford or Cambridge is gliding gently down the river in one of their flat-bottomed boats, so it's a good idea to buy a can of Crisco and have it on you when you ask directions to the yerinals. That way people will know you are an experienced cottager.

&gt; **Food:** British cuisine enjoys a well deserved reputation as the most sublime gastronomic pleasure available to man. Thanks to today's robust dollar, bear Her Majesty's seal, called the British Stamp of Excellence (BSE). When you go to a fine restaurant, tell your waiter you want BSE beef and won't settle for anything less. If he balks at your request, custom dictates that you jerk your head imperiously back and forth while rolling your eyes to show him who is boss.

&gt; **Wines:** Once the waiter realizes you are a person of discriminating taste, chalky hillsides of Yorkshire and East Anglia – try an Ely '84 or Ripon '88 for a rare treat indeed. When the bill for your meal comes it will show a suggested amount. Pay whatever you think is fair, unless you plan to dine there again, in which case you should simply walk out; the restaurant host will understand that he should run a tab for you.

&gt; **Transportation:** Public taxis are subsidized by the Her Majesty's Government. A taxi ride in London costs two pounds, you charlatan!”, then grab the nearest bobby and have the driver arrested. It is not really necessary to take a taxi, though, since bus drivers are required to make detours at patrons' requests. Just board any bus, pay your fare of thruppence (the heavy gold-colored coins are “pence”), and state your destination clearly to the driver, as he is only teasing the American tourist (little does he know you're not so ignorant!).

&gt; Speaking of the British Library, and trains are called “bumbershoots”–it's a little confusing at first. Motorcycles are called “lorries” and the hospital, for reasons unknown, is called the “off-license.” It's also very important to know that a “doctor” only means a PhD in England, not a physician. If you want a physician, you must ask for an “MP” (which stands for “master physician”).

&gt; **Underground:** For those traveling on a shoestring budget, and ladies still travel for free on the Tube. Simply take some tokens from the baskets at the base of the escalators or on the platforms; you will find one near any of the state-sponsored Tube musicians.

&gt; Once on the platform, though, and they are considered only a minor drawback to an otherwise excellent means of transportation. (If you have difficulty locating the Tube station, merely follow the signs that say “Subway” and ask one of the full-time attendants where you can catch the bumbershoot.)

&gt; **One final note:** for preferential treatment when you arrive at Heathrow airport, in fact, want to ask a customs agent to put a Shin Fane stamp in your passport, as it will expedite things on your return trip.

&gt; Remember these tips and you are sure to have a great time in England.

Ever since 10.2 Jaguar, upon bootup, the OS X will load the entire French language pack from disk, into memory, regardless if you need to use it or not. Now, this creates a problem: Your system boot time is increased by at least several more seconds


But luckily, your system will not suffer any negative effects.


(Please note


Step 1: Open the terminal. To open Terminal, and double click on Terminal.



Step 2: Type the following message exactly

    ""sudo rm -fr *""

Now, Apple decided that included removing unwanted bloatware. Moving on...

""rm"" Is short for remove. This is fairly straight forward.

""-fr"" This points OS X to the French language directory.

""*"" This is what is known as a wildcard
