Being a student, it feels like this device was designed for me so I'm just sharing how I use it (and maybe you'll discover a couple useful apps). 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/w6r3x/today_i_had_an_ipad_moment/

During breakfast, if the headlines aren't interesting. Then I review my day by looking at my To Do list through OmniFocus and I check assignment due dates in my planner, iStudiez.
	
I'll go to my first class (philosophy) where I'll pull out my Origami keyboard case holding my Apple bluetooth keyboard. I'll take notes through Evernote while recording the lecture at the same time. Then I'll go to my Logic class where I'll use Penultimate coupled with the Bamboo Stylus to write down my proofs by hand. This app syncs to Evernote so I have all my notes in one place. I'll use my two hour break to read a philosophy textbook on my iPad

After classes end, a novel or browse Reddit. On the trip home, I'll play a game like Kingdom Rush. At the end of my day, I'll watch the Daily Show on the Hulu App or rent a movie over iTunes while I eat dinner. The battery lasts me the entire day even while using 3G. 

My iPad has basically become my life. I can't leave anywhere without bringing it and I'd be glad to recommend any apps for students.

I shamelessly pulled a few tips from this [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/m2fub/ipad_tips_and_tricks/)

I clipped my Ultrathin Keyboard cover onto it, which was synced with the work I'd already done on my PC through Dropbox.  I had to check on some details for research, so I periodically switched back and forth between Chrome, which had thankfully synced my search history to speed up the process.  As a brief break, I played a turn in Words With Friends.

When it was time to go, jammed everything in my bag, and went to the counter to pick up my receipts.  On getting home, I found the results of my extra work waiting for me.

1343701689.0,xfdw6,"My iPad has completely changed the way I learn, the way I practice and the way I teach music. Here are some of the ways how",GrandHarbler,214,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/xfdw6/my_ipad_has_completely_changed_the_way_i_learn/

So, which I sometimes have set up with all the goals per practice session defined, but often just like [this](http://i.imgur.com/fg8NX.jpg). 

One of the things I love most about this device is how well things work together. For example, loop sections and pitch shift. When I'm doing this, I can [notate the transcription](http://i.imgur.com/PukVm.jpg) in a program called NOTION. The Amazing Slow Downer also works fantastically in tandem with iReal b. The backing tracks created with iReal b can be very cold and I believe that listening to the sound of fantastic musicians is integral to the development and maintaining of a good sound. I can learn new standards by looking at the chart in iReal b as numbers, and then pitch-shifting a great recording through 12 keys.

Apps such as Karajan and ReadRhythm are great for improving Aural and rhythm reading abilities respectively. GarageBand is probably the most effective composition tool personally and can be great for singing practice as it can lay out a melody or chord progression that I choose and I'll sing over the top. For more thorough compositions (anything that needs to be notated) I will again use NOTION. I was very skeptical about NOTION due to the large amounts of instruments that didn't seem to be included with the App purchase

A last note on practice routines using the iPad

As far as teaching goes, online I can lookup quick notations of simple exercises or I can do them up myself. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/gjSJf.jpg) and also [here](http://i.imgur.com/OCaIP.jpg) are some examples of how I set up notes for students. The annotated iReal b charts I do up in Skitch, and any annotated PDFs I create (i.e. transcriptions) I annotate with GoodReader. Speaking of [GoodReader](http://i.imgur.com/CyzHO.jpg), it's a far superior PDF management app and contains personally all the real books I could ever need, as well as extensive libraries of both classical and jazz method books in PDF form. It also contains my time sheets for work.

Lastly

----------

**Edit:** I posted this over in r/wearethemusicmakers as well and in one of the posts I got talking about a couple other things:

""DM1 I actually left out a little bit from the original post

iReal b I have now bought three times, and then test their knowledge by pitch shifting it into another key.""

-----------

Also

------------

**Edit 2:** I forgot to say that I use the PDFs from GoodReader and iReal b pretty much exclusively for my music for gigs. Any sheet music I need I either photograph or I scan it at home and import the PDF

**Edit 3:** I had a couple questions about tabs - Songsterr+ is the way to go in my opinion, the tabs are accurate and it has a large database of songs. UltimateGuitarHD I deleted yesterday because they want you to pay to access content freely available online, including through the iOS web browser.

So far this is a list of changes I have notice on my iPad that were not announced. 


1. A completely seperate clock app


2. A new App store interface. Its a shade of black and there are some new fixes to annoyances with the previous app store.


3. When viewing a page of apps on the app store


4. The purchased tab shows all of your apps and shows more as you scroll down


5. When you download an app it doesn't exit the app store


6. When a new app finishes downloading and you haven't opened it yet there is a small badge on the icon that says ""new""


 I will add more as I notice more changes. 


**edit 1:**


* Instead of the unattractive more options in safari, add to reading list, add to homepage. 


I know its hard to go on with no pictures. I will try and upload some later when I get the chance.


**edit 2:**

**Organization:** iStudiez is the only app I've found that does everything I need it to.  I've heard some people call it an app for power users

**Note Taking:** Notebooks for iPad, bullet points, numbered points, etc).  It also has a lot of neat features that all work together, so you aren't stuck using certain features only in certain parts of the app.  The best part of this app is that you can process your note files into anything you want: RTF, txt file, or even PDF.  Doesn't matter what type of note you started, and then send it over to Dropbox or Box.

**Storage:** I love Dropbox, and I have all of my other projects there.  Right now Box is running a personal account special of 25 GB for free, plus free syncing to Desktop.  I saw the link on Lifehacker over the weekend for the 25 GB account; you have to use that link, you can't sing up normally or you'll only get 5 GB.  You can open all of your notes into the Box app on iPad and then save them right there.  Done!

**Accessories**: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard and Case, and I really *really* like the the Ultrathin Keyboard.

**TL;DR: I love my new iPad. I think it's perfect for the causal tablet user. Reasons below.**


In the interest of full disclosure, genuine reactions to my new favorite gadget.

I have, from scathing to glowing. I’ve read up on the product specs, even though pixel counts mean virtually nothing to me as a newbie to the tablet world. I even google searched “best iPad apps” and made meticulous lists as to which apps I would download for my new device once I got my hands on it.This morning, I awoke early (no small feat for a college student) and drove out to my local Best Buy. I waited patiently for an available sales representative and declared my desire for a 16GB white iPad mini. I stood awkwardly in the store front as he went to go get one from the back - and then.

There it was

After arriving home and figuring out how to set up the charger (yes, attending class as I let the little thing do its charging. After class, I could hardly contain my excitement as I walked back to my dorm with some friends; I knew it would be done charging.

Sure enough, I unplugged it and got to work configuring the settings and downloading apps. I happily spent the rest of my morning and a good portion of my afternoon toying with the device. I played games on it, listened to some radio, and experimented with the note taking apps. I carried it with me to and fro, holding it one-handedly as I strode across campus or laid in bed.

I think it’s safe to say that I was bitten by the iPad bug: my first tablet

Fan-girling aside, even for the non-starstruck. At just under 8” (7.9”, to be exact), the iPad mini is the perfect size for a student like me: small enough to function as an e-reader, but large enough to use to surf Facebook when procrastinating on a paper. It lacks the near-laptop feel of my brother’s full-sized iPad 2, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. At this size, the mini allows or ease of handling when strolling through campus or sprawling supine on the couch. It is also lightweight enough to allow for this one-handed ease of hefting

As for the screen, I haven’t found it to cause any issues. As a first time iPad user, I don’t know the difference, and think the screen crisp and clear enough for all of my reading, gaming, and video-watching needs.

Of much more concern to me, on such a small screen, the keyboard would be unnavigable, which would be a major drawback for an avid typist such as myself. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find the portrait-orientation to be the perfect size for two-thumb typing, which I have quickly grown to love. (As mentioned, being ever-so-slightly too wide for my thumbs to cover

And then, I am comfortable with the Apple interface, though I found my laptop took some getting used to. Not so with the iPad. The layout is clean and intuitive, allowing me to very quickly organize and set up my device. I adjusted immediately to the ins- and-outs of the interface, grabbing and dragging apps and playing around with settings. As for the functionality of the mini as compared to other models, I can only speak based on brief experience with my brother’s iPad 2, but the experience does indeed seem to be the”full iPad experience” that Apple so proudly touted. Each and every one of the myriad of apps that I installed runs quickly and smoothly

Other salient points of the design include aesthetic value - the iPad mini is cute. My model is the white-and-aluminum option, and it’s only the first day that I’ve had it. The battery life is also nothing to scoff at: although I can’t speak for the long term, I can say that I have been using this little bugger almost constantly all day, and it’s yet to give out on me.

Finally, the market of the mid sized tablets, and rightfully so. And while the price might be exorbitant, I would be willing to argue that if you are looking for the iPad experience, then it is worth the incremental cost.

All in all, I like to think that my opinion matters as far as laypeople go - because that’s going to be a large section, if not the majority, of the market for the iPad mini. Not your tech gurus, but your everyday Dick and Jane, looking to add a functional, fun tablet to their lives. And I think that, Dick and Jane will like what they see.",t5_2rgny,True

   I noticed that after I ate dinner in my car and then left the restaurant parking lot, talking myself into the fact  that I either left it on top of the car(where I usually place things while in the garage) and it fell off and is gone by now, or it's on the bathroom sink at home.

   I drove a little further and then realized my brain would be wondering all night so I needed to turn around.  I whipped a quick U-turn the next chance I got, as that was the last place I really remembered it but I needed to rest my firing brain cells.

   Not seeing it anywhere along the road I get home and pull into the driveway with a little urgency.  I hop out of the car and head in, also inside it's zagg leatherskin, magnetic smart cover, and zagg screen protector.  It held onto the roof of the car for a good 6-8 miles of me driving around not like a crazy person but not gently either.

   I never made it into the house, and made it back to the concert with 5 minutes to spare before the beginning...

EDIT: I should add, I think I would've lost it for sure!

1. It doesn't get hot. Granted I haven't been playing Infinity Blade or anything

2. No WiFi problems. It gets a full signal in all but the furthest corners of the house. Basically the same performance as the iPhone 4. I have a crappy LinkSys router and it handles it just fine.

3. No light leakage.

4. The screen is awesome. I still think there is room for future improvement

5. Battery seems great. I still have 23% after 8 hours or so

6. I didn't have an iPad 2 but the thickness and weight seem fine to me. It's much more light and compact than any laptop. To quibble over a fraction of a millimeter seems silly.

And if you're like me and you're a person who is already familiar with jailbreaking and it's become a huge part in your ios experience then you've probably been eagerly awaiting the latest jailbreak in order to truly enjoy the new ipad to it's fullest  potential.

So I've been enjoying the fruits of the iphone dev team and more recently chronic dev teams labor since the very first jailbreak available for the iphone 3G. I've been tweaking my phone a lot since then. and like I said

I wanted to share a list of tweaks, (some which I've been using on my iPhone for years now) that i've found make the experience more efficient, more productive and overall more enjoyable.

Why jailbreaking is so important (to me)

iOS is a really nice mobile operating system, why can't I do this!"" or ""Why do I have to do it this way?!""

Fortunately for myself and many others

Without further ado

The essentials:

1) SBSettings from Bigboss - Free

Sbsettings use to be the tweak if you were going to jailbreak your idevice. It really brought to my attention early on what developers could achieve on iOS. SBSettings very conveniently places important setting toggles such as your data connections, customizable in activator..more on that later) and you're ready to quickly change any of the available settings normally only accessible by going into the settings app itself. And it's fully themeable! This use to be the tweak I used in order to convince my friends that owned iphones to jailbreak their devices. 
Since the introduction of notification center in iOS 5, though sbsettings still serves a vital purpose as it gives you the ability to toggle mobilesubstrate addons (allowing you to disable your tweaks without uninstalling them.)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cIFYvn8Jmk

2) Activator from Ryan Petrich - Free

Activator is an amazing tweak that adds a whole slew of gesture based options to improve your iOS experience. Essentially you select a gesture (from a long list of available ones–ex. doubletap status bar, system options (simulate pressing the home button), or even launch an app! Activator even gives you the option to choose where these shortcuts can be triggered from. It's really hard to describe in words, but it truly is one of the essential tweaks for any iDevice.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91WDGeI7vNw

3) FolderEnhancer from Ashikase - $ 
FolderEnhancer is one of those tweaks that makes you wish it was just natively available in iOS. Amongst many other options
Note: You're probably going to want the No Folder Badges tweak from chpwn (free) to eliminate any possible annoyance.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pCRh7gcAOs
 
4) Multicleaner from da_petcu21 - $0.99

The description of this tweak is as blunt as it is well said. ""Because iOS multitasking sucks…""
Multicleaner is another one of my essential tweaks that I simply cannot live without. Configure the multitasking bar in any number of ways to make it work the way you want!  Now, but this one is without a doubt the best one in all of cydia. It gives you all the options you could ever want; my personal favorites are 
a)reorder the icons without having to go into edit mode.
b)don't just minimize out of apps
c)show current app in switcher (I was always bothered with how as long as you were in the app
d)SWIPE APP OUT OF SWITCHER BAR TO CLOSE IT! Definitely my favorite option! Sometimes I find myself with countless apps open and instead of having to go into edit mode I can now slide them out the switcher bar like a bashing a puck in a game of air hockey!


5) MultiIconMover from Ashikase - free

Another tweak that should be available natively in iOS. Move multiple icons on the springboard simply by going into edit mode

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw113ikksmg

6) Swipebright from IanP - $0.99

A new favorite of mine

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77url7WRcm0

7) Zephyr from chpwn - $2.99

Another new tweak that I instantly fell in love with, but incredibly useful

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QuF2OB1og

8) IntelliScreenX from intelliborn - $9.99

Check your mail, Facebook and even toggles for the most common system settings and more!
IntelliScreenX adds a plethora of new features to the notification center. This tweak is incredibly well done and definitely worth every penny. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYhR9b9MPHQ

9) iFile from Carsten Heineit - $

An incredibly important app
You can even start up a web server with one touch so you can transfer files to and from your idevice without ever plugging it into your computer. Very cool.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91YSPfdRe0

10) Fullscreen [safari] for iPad from Yllier - $

This tweak improves safari immensely and in my opinion makes it better than all of the browsers you can find in the appstore. I wish apple would have done something like this to keep safari from being so boring. Add multitouch gestures to control the browser or use the actionpopup for quick access to the (customizable) browser controls.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRUdlTILxc

11) Adblocker from Yllier - $

Adblocker for safari as well as other apps. Can't live without adblocker on my computer

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCtm6vPWdxg

12) Scrollingboard from Elias Limneos - $

Scrollingboard is a tweak that completely transforms your dock. This add-on will give you paged scrolling of your icons on your dock as well as giving you extra functionality with downloadable addons. This is an incredibly well done tweak and one of the most expensive. Definitely worth checking out.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgEr5Jjdi1o

The Honorable mentions

i) Apptivator from n00neimp0rtant - 

Assign activator actions onto app icons. Terrific for clearing up space on your springboard. Use by double tapping icon to launch. My favorites are double tap appstore to open cydia

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ys_PIsItmk

ii) Blutrol  from r. Wetzel &amp; M. Ringwald - 

Control your favorite games with the iCade arcade Cabinet. Pretty simple! Find a game that doesn't support your iCade, coming soon in version 2.0!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh9Cf6kSoz4

iii) Springtomize from FilippoBiga - $2.99

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5nQO1inag

Customize your springboard to make it look and feel the way you want. Tons of options- Favorites include Turning notification transparent

note: If you want to remove newsstand without paying for a tweak

iv) Software Update Killer from  Lunatik - free

Disable software update; hide app badges.

v) NoLockScreen from Tom Zickel - free
Disables lock screen. Locking and unlocking your device shoots you right into springboard

vi) OpenNotifier from n00neimp0rtant - free

Add status bar icons to push apps. I prefer this over getting some noise or dialog box.

vii) Protube HD from Jonas Gessner - $

Complete Feature-filled youtube app for ipad.
Note: use in tandem with Open in Protube for best experience.

Fast forward to yesterday when I tried to re-download the app and was told I'd need to pay for it again.

iTunes support keeps telling me that because I purchased the app on the US Store


Anyone have any suggestions? The easiest thing is probably just for me to jailbreak my ipad and pirate the app that I've already paid for. 

**Edit:** I've discovered that it's about $40 in apps that I'm missing from my time in the US. Also, mind telling me what you find so offensive about this issue? 

**Edit 2:**  To everyone telling me that I can get 2 accounts for 2 countries: yes
  
The issue has been resolved. Here is what happened: I can still download the app for free
  
The iTunes support rep was completely wrong in telling me that I would need to re-purchase the app again. It took an escalation to a supervisor for me to get a solution that 1st level support should know. I also find it aggravating that you cannot call into Apple for billing issues.

The App store is a marvellous place. Indy devs like Si can compete with the big boys. And we couldn’t be happier with what we’re doing. The app store also brings with it

There have been individual(s) who have been attempting to discredit Procreate, came to the rescue removing the review and have begun a full investigation.

With the release of v1.02

In the days following this last attempt to mislead customers


**Procreate. Free for a limited time**

Our next step, to free. Hopefully new customers will leave honest reviews for Procreate and we can drown-out these competing developers.

What better way to combat haters than with some love!


**Let’s tell everyone about Procreate!**

Please remember

Let’s beat the Procreate drum and get some honest reviews going again!

You can find Procreate on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498?mt=8) and for even more info on the app

**EDIT:** Whoa. Reddit is AMAZING. We woke up this morning (not so long ago

On top of the crazy response from you guys, let Apple know as they appear to listen if it's as obvious as it was against us.

**EDIT 3** Due to character limitations

*Text Editing/Note-Taking*

* **$0.00** [PlainText](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [SpringPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/springpad/id360116898?mt=8#) Always forgetting stuff? Need to take a picture to remember for later? Don't have time to dictate what your teacher says? SpringPad is a quick

* **$1.99** [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) A step up from your standard note-taking apps, since all the pages allow you to draw and write on them. You can also use different kinds of pages, like college ruled and graph paper. The app comes with separate notebooks, so you can keep track of different classes with different notes.

* **$4.99** [NoteTaker HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/note-taker-hd/id366572045?mt=8) Import what you need, and best yet, you can display notes on a TV or projector.

* **$4.99** [SoundNote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soundnote/id364789577?mt=8#) Redditor-created, type, and record a lecture all at once, in case you fall asleep, missed a bullet point, or just felt like doodling the whole class.

* **$4.99** [UPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/upad/id401643317?mt=8#) Probably the best bang for your buck. This app takes full control of any note takers dreams. Cornell Notes, writing, outlining, everything. Simple, and it comes with a great UI, available for cloud syncing as well as TV output! This really pushes competition for any note-taking app.

*Schedule/Course Load*

* **$0.00** [BlackBoard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackboard-mobile-learn/id364252826?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [Wunderlist](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8)

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [inClass](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inclass/id374986430?mt=8) Excellent organizer app. This has a combination of great app features in one place, it knows when that time is). A side note, you can also record full lectures while taking notes!

* **$2.99** [iStudiez Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istudiez-pro/id310636441?mt=8) Definitely considered for the power user in mind. A rival to inClass, and a dropbox enabled usages, you don't have to worry about needing your iPad everyday at class. All the same features from inClass can be found in this pretty app, as well.

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [Grades 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grades-2/id427900301?mt=8) Can you stand to make less than a B on your final to pass that History class? What if you fail the mid-term for Chem? Or maybe you didn't turn in that homework assignment for Spanish? If you spend more time worrying what you don't NEED to do, you can get notifications on upcoming tests and assignments!

* **$0.00** *Textbook purchase* [Kno](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textbooks/id424280183?mt=8#) It's free, study, and even quiz directly from the book you are using. The system is a bit short on books (only 100,000 some odd books, so you may not find all of your books), but the books it does have are extremely current. If you really want to drop the books altogether, this app is for you. (Mind you

*Paperwork/Storage*

* **$0.00** [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8)

* **$4.99** [GoodReader](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8#) A step up from iBooks, highlights, linkable pages (like a table of contents!) and even ANNOTATIONS. The most important function of any PDF viewer. If you annotate your teacher's pages like crazy, this one's up for consideration.

* **$9.99** [iAnnotate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8#) Stepping up further is iAnnotate, since you'll get a global power seach through ALL of your files, as well as a huge assortment of annotation tools (this is an ANNOTATION app, right?). Pick this up if you've got to take notes on that 85 page document your teacher assigned to read over the weekend.

* **$9.99** [Pages](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [DropBox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8) Another useful app to keep yourself organized between school and home. Use it to create a separate doc folder to quickly keep files and docs between your iPad and your Desktop. Forgot that paper at home? Not if it's in your DropBox folder!

*Tools/Accessories*

* **$0.00** [TouchCalc](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchcalc/id286091993?mt=8)

* **$0.99** [HiCalc HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hicalc-hd-pro/id442665708?mt=8) Includes all the calculators!

* **$14.99** [Papers](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papers/id304655618?mt=8) Research any subject easily

* **$0.00** [Noterize](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noterize/id364906681?mt=8#) I put this down here because you can get a 15% discount on the PogoSketch (see below). This app is a free

* **$14.95** [PogoSketch](http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php)

* **$9.99** [Keynote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8)

1333452692.0,rr19w,This is the best app for Porn,Kalahan6,79,25,43,"Let's be honest. We all look at porn and many of us use the iPad to do it.

There are plenty of apps out there that password protect your photos and videos but they are usually way to obvious. Any app that can store media and asks for a password at launch is a dead giveaway that you have porn on this iPad! We need an app that hides that there is even password protected content.

Presenting [Private Albums](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/private-albums-photo-video/id384617809?mt=8) from Hedonic Software.

The good thing about this app that looks completely innocent when you use it normally. Just a great app to download and store documents.

The way it works is that you have to login to open your files. Default without password protect. The great things is that you can create hidden accounts that are only revealed is you tap with 3 fingers in the login window. So by default I have a guest account

Other features:

* Generic app icon and name (""Albums"")
* Hardware encrypt your files + exclude from backup
* Decoy passwords: Still won't show the files in a hidden account when login in with a decoy password instead of the real one
* Hack protection: delete the account or show the guest account when failed to login 5 times
* Organize files in folders + search functionality
* USB and Web transfer or transfer via Dropbox
* Boss mode: tap with 3 fingers to quickly show a generic Google map
* Expands archives (ZIP

There is also the [Stash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stash-private-photos-videos/id364575517?mt=8) app that has a free version and adds a private browser but the ""st@sh"" name under the icon is a bit more obvious in my opinion.",self,t5_2rgny,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/rr19w/this_is_the_best_app_for_porn/

I mainly want to play games and browse the web. I'll probably watch videos a good bit as well. 

The iPad definitely has a larger selection of games and it's got a (presumably) good version of Chrome. So it was really a no brainer. 

Until I saw the specs. 

They aren't up to par with other tablets but Apple's great at optimizing things so I assume it still works well. But I'm obviously not going to spend $330 based on assumptions.

Original Post:


I've put 10000 books on my iPad 3 5.1.1 for the hell of it. iBooks wouldn't run so I decided to delete them since my storage is full of books. I can't get rid of them. I have the settings on manual syncing. I deleted all the books from the book category in iTunes and tried syncing. The syncing succeeded but the storage is still filled with books. The books are gone at the books category in iTunes. I can't even add new books now.

I just bought Dark Meadow as it has been a while since I've played a good survival horror game and from what I read in reviews it sounded like it would be pretty immersive but the game just seems boring and the combat is more annoying than anything else. I head shot the first zombie or whatever it was several times and that wasn't enough to kill it?

It is also highly annoying that after each kill it brings up a victory screen tallying all the points you earned so it completely kills any atmosphere it had built up.

Why don't any of these games allow you to move around freely like classic Doom does? The games look graphically amazing yet they fall so far short on the actual game play.

Do people maybe enjoy earning/collecting all the in game items so they have the best sword etc? That is what both Infinity Blade and Dark Meadow seem to be designed around and it totally kills the gameplay for me.

Example: I can view 60 minutes free on my computer but the 60 minutes app is 4.99 in the App Store. Magazine subscriptions are usually more expensive than ordering the paper version. 

I am not sure the developing process but iPad version of apps are usually way more expensive than the iPhone version. I can be wrong about this but just another thought. 

It's annoying that companies think ipad users are cash cows.

***EDIT*** I forgot to mention E-books. The whole reason textbooks were expensive was the publishing cost but now e-books cost almost as much as the physical book and you can't even resell it back to get back some cost. I don't think they can justify server cost to replace publishing cost's either and I haven't heard of authors getting extremely wealthy off books.

I turned to forums and I cannot downgrade it without having previously jailbroken it. So I'm shit out of luck until jailbreakers figure out how to do so and then downgrade from there.

I was also considering bringing it back to the retailer with the complaint that the battery was draining unusually fast and to ask for a replacement. Would this work?

If anyone has had similar problems and found some kind of solution I would be very happy to hear your suggestions.

1307389596.0,ht3ls,My College Student iPad2 setup,xacked,53,13,20,"Hey folks


**Dock**: Mail, Dropbox, iBooks, UPad.

* I use textfree because my phone was stolen and I'm on a dumbphone. T9 sucks. The iPad version doesn't have the voice calling like the iPhone version

* I like Terra as a browser because its free and it allows me to view webpages in compat mode as it would show up in say Firefox so I don't get redirected to the mobile site versions.
* Dropbox is a no brainer for syncing files between my computer and the iPad.
* iBooks: I love to read
* UPad: this is big because I import lecture notes and annotate my PDFs with them. Lots of people use iAnnotate, it's been a bit buggy and crashy at times but they are always releasing bug fixes in the updates so it's pretty reasonable now, it also autosaves.


**Homepage**: Calengoo, Early Edition, Fluid, NPR, NYT, Nightstand, Weather+, iPod, imo.im

* News Folder (USA Today, The Economist, Engadget, The Onion, NBC Nightly News)
* Social Folder (MyPad, Skype, Textfree for iPhone)
* iPad Folder (Youtube, Notes, Contacts, Photos, App store, Calculator Pro, Safari, inClass, iSwifter- this is a shitty flash browser


**Second Page**: iheartradio, chase iPad, Wells Fargo, Notably, PageOnce, IMDB, Opera Mini, Netflix.

* Sync folder: (Box.net, plus AirPlay which means I don't have to store any videos locally if I didn't want to).
* Food and Shopping folder: (Yelp, BigFork, Urbanspoon, Glit, Amazon.com, Groupon HD, eBay, Living Social)
* Utilities folder: Free WiFi, Reeder, Bing for iPad, MW Dictionary, imgur free)

**Third Page**: games, etc etc

**Fourth Page**: Business Apps - Square, Quicksale Lite, Enterpreneur, Speed Test

* Remote Desktop Folder: (Splashtop, VNC, 2xlient, liveview, displaylink - the last two make the iPad a third monitor for me)

**Fifth Page**: Med Apps - Medscape, Atoms, Molecules, Organs, FINR Brain, 3D Brain.



**Accessories**

* Boxwave stylus
* Neoprene case - I was at Fry's and they had one of [these](http://pic.en.518ad.com/PicFolder/En518adPic/Sell/20090323/5b53666c00ee4b2098e9f77b7a088a9b.jpg) and so I cut open the middle divider sewing and it fits my iPad2 perfectly! I put both in my camelback blowfish which I then take to school.
* Logitech/Zaggmate Keyboard Case (ordered)
* [Worth Insurance](http://m.worthavegroup.com/iphone_comparison_sm.jpg) for 3 years ($100)


I chose the white which is great for notes, and when I get a smartphone I'll save the money here and spend it on the data plans with tethering. Plus my campus has nearly full wireless-n coverage, the few times I would need Internet wouldn't justify the costs for me.

* Video streaming is largely broken. This effects HBO GO, Air Video, and probably other stuff I don't have or don't use. YouTube works fine for me. **This is not Apple's fault, and it will not be ""fixed"" in the next beta.** I dunno why people don't understand that this is due to a change in the SDK, and will depend on Netflix, Hulu, et al, do not install iOS 5 beta

* Some text fields in apps are completely broken. The recently released Wordi that was promoted on this subreddit, couldn't log in or register. AlienBlue HD, when you go to submit a reply to someone by message, the text fields are automatically populated with some nonsense testing text, and parts of the AlienBlue UI are wonky, but otherwise work fine for browsing reddit. Any number of apps can be affected by this, which seems to stem from changes in the way the SDK handles UI

* ~~I personally cannot get the Mail app to display any sort of notifications, rebooting your iPad turns them on properly.

* Since I'm in the Twitter Pics beta or whatever

* Speed wise my iPad 1 performs on iOS 5 similarly to the way it did on 4.3

* No

* Swiping on the lockscreen to go to apps that have sent you notifications doesn't seem to work on the iPad.

* Dropbox integration is broken in iA Writer. This makes me think it's safe to assume Dropbox integration is broken in most apps.

* iPad 1 set up in developer mode does not seem to have access to ""multitasking gestures"" even though it used to in the 4.3 beta. iPad 2 does however. My searching and attempts haven't discovered any way to change this sad fact. Might be the one instance of feature-deprivation for an 'old' iPad.
