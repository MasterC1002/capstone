Hi! New here at /r/deals, I figured I would contribute deals that I think are worth a look. FYI, all of these deals are shamelessly ripped from slickdeals. I don't know if this subreddit subscribes to any abbreviations for common shopping terms, i.e.:

* YMMV - Your mileage may vary 
* OOS - Out of stock 
* S/H - Shipping and handling 
* MIR - Mail in rebate IR - Instant rebate 
* B&amp;M - Brick and mortar store (A physical retail store as opposed to an online merchant) 
* CPN - Coupon 
* FAR - Free After Rebate 
* GC - Gift certificate 
* PM - Price match
