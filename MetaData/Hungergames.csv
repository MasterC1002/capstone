**What we thought Suzanne Collins was doing:**

* writing an incredible action-suspense-coming-of-age story that was character driven. 

* Appealing to teens with a Twilight-esque love triangle.

**What Suzanne Collins was actually doing:**
 
* Luring us in with her characters and love story to send us a stark message about the dangers of war, classism, consumerism and more.

* Turning us as spectators into something like the villains of the book (Weren’t the arena scenes the best to read? Weren’t we also entertained by teens and tweens fighting to the death?)

While there was a lot I did not like about *Mockingjay* (basically meandering

We want Katniss and Peeta to go through this horrific series of events and come out as heroes. But they (particularly Katniss) come out as prototypical post-traumatic-stress victims. For her to come out any other way would be to condone everything that happened to her. “What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger right?” Well not when what is trying to kill you is heinous and completely irredeemable. That Katniss is a mess at the end is a major indictment of the events that led her there. 

Frankly

In so many ways, we pay for it. We see the cost. There are victims. The victims are our heroes, either completely gone (Prim) or wounded beyond repair (Katniss and Peeta). Collins won’t let us off easy because she is holding on to the hope that we are not the Capitol.

First off, I waited and by chance the movie played at my school's theatre at the beginning of this semester. I found that it actually was not that bad and decided to give the book a read, with NO intention of reading on into the series.

Little did I know I'd be sucked into it. And tonight, but I was skeptical and certainly did not expect her to die in the way that she did. I was in shock for a few minutes. The whole undertone of the ending of the book (the depressing, dark, secluded feeling) really caught me off guard and I was very surprised at how it ended. Most books end with a semi-happy ending, but I couldn't help feel depressed. Even in the epilogue I was like...NO."")

Also, unlike the mindset of people in Katniss's era. 

It would've taken a while to build the first arena, the districts are very persistent in their belief that they might still win. 

As times goes on

Little do the people of Panem know that the arena is finished

The tributes aren't chosen in such a civilized manner at this point. A boy and a girl from every district is chosen by some nameless person working for the Capitol. Then

They are congratulated immediately - further mockery - and told that their child has been chosen to participate in the first annual Hunger Games. The boy and girl are then immediately taken

The only thing the children are given is a tracking injection and plain, and nothing else. The children are all taken to the entrance of the arena. 

Twenty-four doors begin to open, 9, 8 - everyone's heart is racing - 7, 6, 5 - a girl from district nine begins to panic and makes a run for it, and is immediately obliterated by a landmine - 4, 3



That's my take on how it would've gone. It's not finished (probably never will be)

1) they make a point to show that she is familiar with plants and surrounding foliage during the training  scene where she is at the big screen matching the different plant silhouettes with apparent ease

 Early in the first book, and bread in her head. The dandelion was a symbol of hope, life, and renewal for her. Remember. After Peeta gave her the bread that saved her life, and her family's lives, she saw a dandelion in the distance. The bread alone would likely have not been enough to have saved their lives. It was a temporary reprieve from their starvation. But, the dandelions showed her that there was something for her to do, and it suggested that she winter was giving way to spring.  She could hunt and gather

At the end of Mockingjay, all along, the dandelion (Peeta) that symbolized rebirth and life. Those qualities in Peeta complemented her fire and aggression. And that wasn't just because of what had happened. Remember, she said that this is what would have had to have happened anyway. She had to end up with Peeta, as they are much better for one another.  Peeta was, just as the original dandelion, she spring after the brutal deadly winter.  Just as she was about to give up hope, and sees that spring and rebirth are right around the corner

An interesting thing to note is that the dandelion always follows a major event.  But, the dandelion came after winning the war, and preventing Coin from replacing the Capital with another dictatorship.  I think that the story of Peeta and the loaves at the beginning of The Hunger Games is a microcosm of the entire narrative arc that follows.

In the film, they're in cushy seats, watching a screen. They're basically in a movie theater. The director intended that. The film is saying, ""You could be these people.""

That's why I was terrified when almost everyone in my premiere audience clapped at the deaths of Clove and Cato. A girl was beaten to death against a wall. Cato delays killing Peeta to explain that his life doesn't matter

Would the games exist without Seneca? He is not the driving factor. He could easily be replaced. Snow is no different. He's just a part of the madness.

Readers, remember that there is a greater enemy behind it all: that part of our nature which craves the sight of bloodshed, which refuses to see past the surface of the stories we are told, which cares more for fashion than for the starving or afflicted.

I'm not saying that people shouldn't be satisfied by justice. I won't say we have to give our lives up to save the poor. But we must stop rejoicing in violence. It's ok to be impressed by a show of power or to want the villains stopped and kept from doing harm ever again. Regardless

1335558080.0,svt58,Finally finished Mockingjay. I see what all the fuss about the ending is about. I have some comments. [SPOILERS INSIDE].,TareXmd,68,4,28,"It hit me hard, it seems essential. Either we get this ending, 'count' in a very unsatisfying way --the rebels would have killed him anyway)

I have to say, thus the reader's only motivation. Prim was hope. She was the innocent future that lied ahead. When she died, so did everything else. Even if the Katniss/Snow/Coin exchange hadn't occurred, everything good was already gone with Prim's death. But she had to die. And this brings me to why the ending was so masterful.

When Prim died, but Panem as a whole. It also helped Katniss decide it was Peeta she needed to survive. It also led to Snow's ""irrelevant"" death, since it really wasn't all about him, as a person. Prim's death triggered a chain of events that lead to a much deeper conclusion bigger than Katniss, Snow and Prim as individual people. It had to happen. It was sad, and you can feel the remnant bitterness in Katniss' life when the book ended --you can feel she'll never be a 'happy' person again... The kids and Peeta could give her something to look forward to, but not enough to make her a 'happy person'... It felt sad

The exchanges between Katniss and Snow were incredible --both the one in his room, and it was made better by the fact I never saw it coming. I also loved how Collins didn't seem to hint at it in any of Katniss' internal monologues.

Other annoyances were also diluted by Prim's death, and thought nothing could make up for that, not even a Katniss-delivered arrow into Snow's heart, especially knowing that the rebels would have got to Snow anyway. It made me hate Katniss for her selfishness, causing all those deaths for her own personal vendetta. However, Prim's death brought matters into prespective, and it was no longer about losing Finnick

In short, given how 'real' this ending felt, and how dramatically it was delivered. Well done, Ms. Collins.",,False,,True,t3_svt58
