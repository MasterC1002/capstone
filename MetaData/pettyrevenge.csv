There was a long drive contest on the 18th hole. The way a long drive competition works in a tournament is there is a little marker with a pad of paper on it out in the fairway. If you hit your ball in the fairway past the marker, but then again, that's golf for you.

I was in the second-to-last group, and free the beast all over that golf ball. By some fluke, it ends up drawing down the right side of the fairway. I crushed this thing. Based on yardage left, I hit this ball a little over 330 yards. I had the previous long drive beat by almost 20 yards. I happily signed the marker, and put it next to my ball.

Well...nope! He passes me and then slows down in front of me
At the next traffic light I tell the guy how dangerous his driving was and that he should quit it. Apparently I shouldn't have because he flips his lid and starts opening his car door

Thankfully the light turns green

Later that evening I'm doing grocery shopping

I'm out of the store before him and heeey

And oh boy did I! Not only did he completely flip his shit about the ticket ( Which btw has a diffrent plate number on it but apparently he's blind with rage ).

Bonus points because there's 2 cops nearby. The asshole stomps over to them and begins to rant and curse and swear at them like there's no tomorrow. At first the officers try to calm him down but this guy's fucking nuts. So after a minute or so the officers have enough

Ok so the mom is sitting across from me and the kid is next to her and in between us are these magazines and all that and some crayons and just junk on the table. Well I'm reading a magazine and the kid picks up a magazine that is obviously not something he's interested in, he sighs. I move my leg, he moves his leg. I pick up another magazine, he picks up another magazine. He's copying me, in other words

So at first this was vaguely amusing, etc, and this kid is mimicking everything I do with this shit eating grin on his face like he's got me and there's nothing I can do about it

Eventually it gets so that he's mocking my eye movements and facial expressions

Up until this point, I wasn't in the mood, and the mom was over indulgent of him and something had to be done to right the balance of the universe

1376492594.0,1kcno0,Neighbor kids kicked my cat and broke a couple ribs,Decyde,3995,1702,521,"Someone told me to cross post my comment here from yesterday.

A couple of kids who lived in my neighborhood who were around 10-12 years old kicked my cat while it was laying out in front of my porch sun bathing.  I was looking out the window while I saw them walk by and do it and when I opened the door

This whole thing happened at about 4:30 pm and I ended up getting home at 7:00 pm.  When I got home

The police came and got my statement and talked to the parents.  They denied everything and then came and told me there was little they could do.  I could try filing in small claims court to recoup my vet bills but I told him there was next to no way I'd win and he apologized to me and hoped my cat would get better.

I went to work the following day and told my co-workers about the incident and they felt sorry too for my cat.  I got pissed off to the point where I wasn't going to let them get away with it.  The day after this

I went to work and thought about dumping them on the other side of the city but instead

I was on my porch most of Saturday when I saw them crying and dragging their cut up bike pieces home to their parents.  I saw the police come over to their home later in the day but I was sure they told them that there was no proof I did it so they didn't stop by and talk to me.  In the end

This happened about 10 years ago and my cat was 7 at the time.  She lived to be 11 before she passed away in her sleep one night.

1371051554.0,1g78ps,Petty Revenge at the Strip Club,DrRat,3484,1338,503,"A little bit of background before I get into the petty revenge. I’m a dancer at a strip club in Florida. It’s a small club in a relatively conservative area, and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show. We even get middle-aged couples (they’re always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene).  For the most part, they make passive-aggressive remarks putting you and your profession down.  That’s fine. Dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence


For those of you who aren’t familiar with how most strip clubs are set up, the closer to the stage you sit, the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances. The stage will have chairs around it which is called ‘the tip rail’. At the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage, but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there. At my club, there are about a dozen chairs around the stage.  When a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail, she normally does something a little extra for the guy. If it’s a dollar or two I just let them stick it in my G-string. If it’s $5-$10 I’ll motorboat, or shake my butt. If it’s $10-$15 I’ll wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits. Anything over $15 I’ll climb off the stage and give them a 30 second lap dance.  If a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing, and all the chairs around the tip rail are full, but we can't really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied


Here is where the petty revenge comes into play. Every once in a while one of those scowling, arms crossed, pissed off and bitter. For the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like I do with non-tipping men. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night, and don’t tip when they should be. She told me I’m taking the wrong approach in ignoring them. Next time it happens, treat the girl like she tipped $15 – wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face. So I did. The next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didn’t tip, I SHOWERED the girl with attention: boobs in her face, ass jiggling, pussy in the face, but unable to do anything about it because she’s sitting at the tip rail and I’m just doing my job. In addition
I now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time: I make more money

It was Saturday morning around 5 am and I had just gotten finished putting all of the room checkout slips under the doors of the people checking out.  I was in back finishing up my paperwork when I hear ""ding ding ding"" (I would put a bell out if I was in back working so I knew when people came up to the desk.) I reply ""I will be back up in a minute"" and I heard ""ding ding ding"" again.  I ignore it since I knew he heard me

I come around the corner and take the bell out of his hands (since he's still ringing it even though I'm in front of him).  I smile and say ""How can I help you?"" and he replies ""There's a mistake on my bill.""  I take the bill and look at it, ""These video charges... they aren't mine.""  I look at the bill again and see around $250 in video movie charges.  I reply back ""Sir, these were movies were checked out of your room and the system automatically processes them.""

He looks uncomfortable and he then accuses the housekeeping staff of renting the movies while he was out of his room.  I highly doubt this

He returns around 6:30 am and in tow with him are a group of other adults and kids checking out (he's chatting with them

One thing you should know is that the rental system in most hotels will tell the hotel staff exactly what movies were watched, most people catch it within the first few minutes and call down immediately to have the charges removed.  Which we have no problem with because hey, it happens.

I look over his report and ALL the movies rented are adult films.  They were all watched for 15-20 minutes and they were all late at night at almost the same exact time (there is no way the housekeeping staff was here that late at night or would be in someone's room). It was hard not to smirk

Then this guy narrows his eyes and out of no where stars yelling at me. ""Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you

Well, movie titles, and how long they were watched for.  A few of the adults start pulling their kids away from him, a few starting laughing at him, and one guy even said ""You sicko, just pay the nice lady your bill for your pornos.""  The best part: All the titles were for granny porn. 

He grabs the bill from me and runs out of the hotel (literally ran).  A bunch of the adults start laughing harder and I hope is that to this day they have not let him live it down.

Background:

During college I was in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend Mary (now my wife). We went to neighboring state schools, was also planning on visiting my school. They only lived about 30 minutes apart from each other, so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up. Jess offered to use her car if Mary would drive them up there, with the condition that Jess would drive Mary home on the way back.

Since it's a college town, some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town. Since we're all doing each other favors I offered to park Jess' car there and save everyone some money.

I met them both when they arrived Friday afternoon.  Jess went to hang out with her friends, if you know where the free lot is located...

Anyway

Jess had decided that she didn't have time to drop Mary off at home anymore. And that she would leave Mary several towns over. At which point Mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way. Oh

I was pissed, and went to meet that bitch Jess.

The revenge:

I told Jess ""Sure, walked to my car and started driving Mary home. The thing is, the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town. It took me 25 minutes to walk there, moving at a relatively fast pace, and knowing exactly where I was going.

Jess was still calling me 2 hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions. Mary was half way home before Jess even started her trip. I hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save 30 minutes, that's probably giving her too much credit.

Finally, telling how they can back up my claim.  The HR person immediately calls R into the HR office and fires her on the spot for ""repeated sexual harassment of fellow employees"".  The look of shock/surprise on her face made it all worthwhile, especially when she looked over and saw the knowing smirk on my face.

Needless to say I vacillated between self-doubt and suspicion for a few days before I finally ""congratulated"" one of the 90%'ers on his score.

The petty revenge gears started turning in my head for what seemed like ages before I replied ""no problem, I'm just glad to help!""

At the next exam I put my my paper in very clear view of Matt. He had been told that I was now willing to ""help"" him and his friends. I circled all wrong answers while making a special mark for the correct ones. Just before the time was up, and smugly walked back to my seat.

1) I'm still a little (just a little) intoxicated from the time these events took place
2) I have the utmost respect for tipping, bartenders, etc., having worked in the food industry myself. 
So let me begin.

Tonight, all that stuff, everything was great until one point. See, I had left my jacket with coat check, but at some point I had lost my coat check ticket by accident. For a normal drunk this would certainly be disastrous, but I had my wits about me, and due to planning this couldn't be that big a problem.

See, I knew exactly what was in each pocket of the jacket, hell, I even had a PHOTO ID in one of the pockets. Easy enough to get me my jacket back, right? Nah.

After waiting in line, I have to wait for closing (three hours later) and a manager to get it back, long after the last skytrain (fancy talk for subway) leaves and forces me into a $65+ cab home. I ask if they can just call a manager over, I understand they can't just give out coats without tickets all willy-nilly, but with a manager called over, really taking the minimum amount of effort possible, the whole thing could've been over within 30 seconds. Nope, there's no way I'm leaving without it and having it ""disappear"" when I go to get it the next day

Easier said than done.

After again explaining how easily this whole situation could be resolved, ""We're going to ignore you now."" Now I'm not competitive man, I'm not a vengeful man, but I am a patient man. A very patient man. In this case, a man with unlimited patience. So I said, ""I'm going to ignore you too."" But that is not all that I did.

The petty revenge

If you're going to be waiting around for a very long time, for bar closing, you have to have something to lean against. In this case, l chose the empty pitcher that served as tip jar for the two coat check attendants. Immediately I saw a splash of panic in one of their eyes, but out of their principle, not a word of protest. As long as they were refusing to rectify my easily fixable situation, I refused to let them take in a  single cent of tip, with a smile on my face. Nothing. Even when they tried to get clever and set out a second one at the far side of the counter, gotta grab this, damn it.

So, and a devastating one at that, but I got the satisfaction of watching them slowly realize the error of their stubbornness over a long, long time, their faces turning from stony half-smiles to the bitterest of longings for what those two pitchers could have meant to them. Lo and behold, a bit before closing my coat-check ticket ""was turned in"" and I got to leave with my jacket before the manager got involved. I got everything I needed while they left with nothing. Success!
Sorry if this was convoluted garbage

I'm mild-mannered. I'm quiet, like a nun...but not). 

I live in a small rural town in Southern Ontario, really. I have never really encountered rudeness, aside from my brief foray into the world of retail. I have also never been on the receiving end of any racial abuse. That is until the fateful day I went to my local grocers to see that it was, in fact, closed early that day. 

Sighing, right? And it'd be silly to not get bread and eggs based on things I wasn't even sure were true, right? 

So off I went. I walked into the grocers and began perusing the fruits. The town, but no one had given me any dirty looks. I was contented and went on my way. Until I heard, 

""Why is *she* here?""

I didn't pay no mind

""People like *her* should not be allowed in this country.""

My back stiffened. I was, she looked at me with such hatred I was shocked. Her bony fingers pointed at me in an accusingly. My eyes widened, but I stood my ground and decided that perhaps she was just batty, and went on with my shopping calmly. 

Standing next to her was her husband, and I was going to say nothing too. I'd let it go, II didn't want to get into a verbal altercation. I just wanted to get my things and go home. 

The old lady did not rest

""Religion is evil but Islam is the most evil.""

""You are dirty

""You're a pig.""

""Islam is disgusting.""

""Go back to your own country you illiterate bitch.""

""I bet you fuck pigs.""

And on, anyway? I just existed and she hated me based on my existence! I, for the life of me, don't understand how you can hate someone based purely on their physical appearance. 

The other customers and the cashiers were starting to stare now, at all and most of them were seniors anyway. 

I have, I'm about to exit the store and then I calmly turn around and face her for the first time.

This whole time I had been silent, how disgusting I am etc etc.

So I said in my clipped accent

""I find it surprising that you know *so* much about me just based on my appearance.""

She gestured to my headscarf and spat
""That thing tells me all I need to know.""

So I said

""Well I thought you looked like a crack whore when I first saw you. But now I can see your face I realize you're far too ugly to be one.""

She turned bright red in apoplectic rage and began screeching at other customers at this injustice I had caused her. 

Suddenly a green-aproned man with a name tag that said 'manager' appeared. She turned to him saying how horribly I had been her

He calmly allowed her tirade to abate and said

""You're a sorry excuse for a human being and you and your husband aren't allowed back here again. Please get out of my sight.""

He then turned me and apologized profusely for not being alerted sooner to the situation

The old lady was spitting with rage so as I drove off I gave her a cheery wave. 

TL;DR: Called a racist too ugly to be a crackwhore

I painted the first few times, but it's a white jamb and I decided the paint smell was more suspicious than the unpainted spackle. It's a thin seam, but I've seen her grasp the air where a doorknob used to be a hundred times. Fuck the macaroni grill.

I saw the neighbors car in our driveway again, the neighbor. He wants to move his car and he is sorry that he parked there. I get in my car and flip the kill switch.

We come back and he was seething. He gave us a death stare for trapping his car on our property. He runs up to us and demands that I move my car. I told him that I'll move it after I go to the bathroom (this wasn't a joke I really had to take a shit). It completely slipped my mind. About half an hour later we get a knock on the door.

Fast forward 3 weeks. We see a different car parked in our driveway. We recognize it as one of theirs. The windows were rolled down a bit

In the past I have called tow companies to tow cars off our property but they never come. However the cops will tow a car if it is obstructing traffic. This leads to my idea.

I reach inside the open window and unlock the door. I then hop in the car and disengage the E-Brake. My driveway is sloped gently down to the street. I ride the brake, lock the doors and get out. I called the police and tell them that an illegally parked car is blocking the street. They come and in quick order tow them away. 

I was a bit short sighted on this call, and my dad answers it. He said some BS like ""Oh we just got down here about 15 minutes ago (car was towed like 2 hours ago) and I was glad to see you didn't park here. I would call the police and report your car stolen.""

I ended up tracking my bag to the companies office, opened my bag up, and my Macbook computer was gone. As you can imagine, I was very upset, but I kept my cool as I pretty much felt I was SOL.

I gave them the number, and they were able to track the computer back to New York, and even had the name of the individual who had the computer. 

With this information, I gave them the name of the individual. Their demeanor immediately changed, and it turns out it was one of their employees who had my computer. They agreed to refund my money, as long as I would not release personal information such as names, the company name, etc.

Sure enough, there was a pretty obvious, phlegmy loogie right in the middle of her burger. Since food tampering is a pretty serious offense, she went inside the restaurant to confront the drive through employee. He denied over and over again and then had the nerve to tell my aunt that she had no proof he had done anything to her burger. His smugness sent her over the edge, so she left the McDonald's with the burger in her hand as the evidence that the drive through moron claimed she didn't have. A little later two other police officers arrived at the McDonald's to question the douche bag. They told him that the burger was all the evidence they needed, and if they needed to, but they didn't need to in the end because the kid broke down like a sputtering idiot and confessed to spitting in the burger.

This day I drew a man looking for a bigger than normal bribe. Typically

I refused to pay and he struck my inspection card with the big red pen. This meant that he found everything incorrectly installed

So I waited a couple weeks and followed him home from a busy day of gouging blue collar guys plying their trade skills. I still hadn't formulated what I wanted to do to him

Perfect. 

So I watched and waited

When he left for work one morning and I didn't have anything to do, good strong timbers. Perfect. Took note of where his water meter was and checked what type of electrical meter system he had. All easily accessible. 

I worked a few construction sites over the next few weeks and collected some sheets of leftover plywood. Not the lightweight stuff

Finally, I refused to pay the exorbitant bribe rates. That was the last fucking straw. I waited until the next week which was a government holiday, 4 day weekend, that sort of thing. Either way, the very places he'd need to call would be closed to deal with the shitstorm that was coming. 

He trundled off to work that morning while I was watching from down the road in a rented white pickup truck filled with precut wood and my framing tools. Again I was in my faux city coveralls and hard hat. I backed the truck right up and started setting the wood panels around the house corresponding to their measurements. Once those were set up

Then I moved on to the electrical meter can and pulled that free

For the coup de grace, why not grab em?)

I then cleaned up my work

After getting lunch and ditching the extra tools back at the house

I watched him call the cops and when they showed up

I watched him try to pull the wood off and since I used way too many nails he just couldn't do it. I smiled so hard I thought my face would crack. It was beautiful watching that man have a breakdown in his front yard

I drove away after watching for as long as I dared and spent the weekend enjoying life and doing service calls. I still smile when I think of that day. The inspector was fired a couple years later by the city when people started really bitching about the bribery accusations.

Months go my sister learned about a One Direction concert in our home country (Belgium). As a good brother I decided to get her a ticket (because I could).

As the months passed on she started to realize a bit of a problem. The concert would be done at midnight, so after looking for parents who were driving their kids as well (she told me none of her other friends were going, note that all tickets were also sold out), and trying to fix my schedule so I could pick her up, I ended up finding the ideal solution.

A busservice was riding, and back. It seemed perfect and she agreed with me, so I paid another 20 bucks for the bus fare and arrenged her a seat in that bus.

That was 2 weeks ago. Three days ago she suddenly tells me she won't take the bus afterall (the bus was already paid and there was no refund possible). She had discovered the bus would arrive an hour before the concert

I told her it was unlikely she'll get autographs, calling me the worst words and telling her how I was taking everything away from her.

I pointed out that without me there wouldn't be a concert for her

This made her go berserk and she shouted that I should start treating her more like an adult

I just told her I wasn't comfortable with her taking the train from and to that city on her own

She then told me she had arrenged for going with the train with her friends for the past few months

Now comes the revenge bit

My sister is notorious for never setting an alarmclock. She depends on me or our father to wake her up in time for school and other things. If we don't do that

She was taking the 7AM train, I think) so she can take the bus like I arrenged for her. If she gets angry for not waking her up, I'll tell her she asked me to treat her like an adult. 

UPDATE:

At 2:15 PM she woke up. She was of course grumpy and started demanding why I did not wake her up earlier. I reminded her that she wanted to be treated as an adult

* he borrowed her car without permission

* he would obsessively check her phone and internet history to make sure she wasn't talking to other guys.

Each office suite has a handful of spaces and they're clearly labelled. Typically, if you park sideways behind two cars (i.e. blocking two cars in, as you're just blocking in your coworker's cars and they can easily get you to move if they need to get out. My office is in the corner of the office park. We have a space next to the wall and the space next to that. The next couple of spaces are (obviously) allocated to the office next door. I usually get in early enough to grab the space next to the wall. 

Now, we'd just knock on their office door and ask the owner of the car to come out and move it. It happened so often that the landlord put a sign on the door of their office to remind visitors that they have to park in assigned parking spaces (if we're having visitors, we make sure we leave a space for them as there are only a couple of visitors' parking spaces for the whole office park and they're always taken).

So, totally full of himself, thinks the world revolves around him etc. You know the type. It isn't the first time (or even the tenth time) that he's taken one of our spaces, either.

I don't want to have to drive right down the road and walk back, points to his cigarette (which by the look of it, he'd only just lit), and turns back to his conversation. I say ""excuse me"" again, and get ignored again. I beep my car horn again. He turns to look at me. I point out that there's assigned parking and I need to get back to work. He shrugs, tells me he'll only be a minute, and turns his back on me again.

Obviously, but he'd rather inconvenience me, so I reversed my car right up to the wall, blocking him and one of my coworkers in. I got out of my car and he demanded that I get back in my car and wait as he'd only be another few minutes. I told him that I needed to get back to work and that he could knock on the door when he was ready and I'd come back out and move. TWENTY MINUTES later (glad I wasn't still in my car!), there was a knock on the door. One of my coworkers answered it and came to tell me that I needed to move my car. Now, usually I'd be straight out, but as this person was a repeat offender, turned his back on me when I was asking him to move his car and had talked down to me when I'd parked, as per the sign on the door to the office that he was visiting

I waited a minute before going back in to see the results of my revenge. I see the printer spitting out double sided prints of BLACK pages. The librarian saw it and freaked the fuck out.

So I waited for 40 minutes for this girl to finally leave. By now it was 7:55 and I had 5 minutes to shower and get to work, attractive, in-shape girl who scoffs when she sees me waiting patiently and gave me a half hearted apology and said that she worked at 8 and didn't want to smell like her tanning lotion. I replied with a sheepish ""yea... its fine."" I walk into the shower room and see she left her phone. I smile and lock the door behind me and not even a minute later I hear her knock but I just get into the shower with a huge smile on my face. I left the shower room 15 minutes later ready for work with an evil glare from the girl who was now also late for work.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there

The next day I went to my manager, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Total Dissolved Solids, my water is clear, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So

Finally, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

**Backstory**: I went to a private co-educational school for high school, as chosen by my sister. Normally before I walk the dog after school I would change into some casual clothes, maybe a hoodie and some shorts, but today I didn't.

**The Incident**: So this particular day I was waiting to cross the road with the dog. I had my full school uniform on and the purple lead in my hand. Then these two douchebags in a white van pull up at the traffic light and roll down their window. I'm looking ahead minding my own business when I hear ""Hey faggot!"", Blazer boy"" that I turned around. I looked over and one of them was leaning out the window shaking an open fist near his mouth like he was sucking a dick. Now I'm not gay. Nor have I ever been gay so this made no sense. And I had never seen these guys before so they had no reason to do this. As this guy finished doing his blowjob impression with his friend in the driver seat laughing hysterically, he said 5 words which just angered me so much: ""You gay shit, kill yourself"". 

**The revenge:** The crossing light went green at this point and I began walking away from them. They followed slowly alongside me, looked at them, pulled out my phone and said the number for the police out loud as a dialed it in. The look on their face was priceless as they realised what was happening, they sped off down the street and through a red light. A camera flash went off as they went through. There was one ticket coming their way. I had memorized their number plate and told it to the police, who apparently found them doing 80km/h in a school zone, which in Australia is normally 40km/h and charged them not only for verbal abuse, but also for speeding

1373466618.0,1i0br7,Petty Revenge Gods granted me...a jar of Vicks.,Caske,1582,323,203,"So this happened back in middle-school. I rode the bus to school and home every day, and one day they brought a bag of Doritos and actually began spitting chewed-up Doritos at us. Every now and then we would lash out at them and throw things back

This had gone on for almost a year. Nobody ever paid any attention to it, and after a while it just sort of became background noise. 

One of the girls had nice, judging from what I had heard them talking about behind us. I'll call her Butt. One day, my friend was out sick so I alone was the subject of their tortures. We were on our way to school and she sat behind me once we got to her pickup spot. Butt had placed her hair in a ponytail with a red flower on the side of her head. After greeting her friends, popped up from her seat and spit on my head. Now they had spat at us before, even fired half-chewed Doritos, but they had always missed. This time it was directly dripping onto my head, as if I was in some type of horror movie with the beast clinging to the ceiling and oozing its body fluids down my face.

At this point, I needed something better. It was at that moment that I finally let the hatred flow through me, and I looked all around the immediate area, praying that I would find some kind of object or tool to exact my revenge, not later that day, not the next day, but NOW. And my prayers were answered.

Underneath my seat

Like an artist fueled by the madness burning inside of him, and time was running out. I had to make sure that every last drop of that little jar full of revenge was smeared onto some part of the plate.

We started pulling up to the curb at school. We had arrived late and the line of buses in front of us had already dropped off their loads of kids. Butt continued to pop up to let fly drops of spittle. I had been timing it the entire ride. Almost every 30 seconds. I listened. The sound of her popping up to spit made a slight sound

I heard her start to stand, around her ears, making sure to get it on the back of her head as well. The bus stopped and the doors opened. I stood up, dropped the plate on the floor of the bus, and glanced at her. She had a look of shock and horror on her face, her hands running through the blue glazed glob covering her hair. She began to cry. I turned, without saying a word, basking in the howls of laughter coming from the rest of the kids on the bus directed at her. Her friends had their hands covering their mouths

Together, and then drove down to the headgate of ""my"" old ditch, and opened it fully.

The people on the second floor said that they first noticed the bites about two months ago (we had first noticed them about three weeks prior to this; strike one, but this was strike two anyway. Big swing and a miss). The family in this apartment told me that they had moved in after their old house was foreclosed, and they didn't want to make waves because they didn't have the means to find somewhere else to go, so they dropped it.

Then I go down to the first floor. These were the newest tenants; it was a family that had moved from a not so pleasant part of town to our building via a rent assistance program that the city offered. Same story as the second floor, the prior tenants were grabbing their last few belongings and one of them said something about making sure the bugs get taken care of. They gave me a similar story about not wanting to make waves in this apartment because they really didn't want to move back to the old neighborhood, as the school district in this one was leagues better.

So now I know this motherfucker is lying through his teeth and hoping that he'll have a building full of people who don't want to make waves. Fuck you buddy, and what the results of civil litigation would be if I could catch this dude in his lies. The extortion part doesn't go so great, but I expected as much. The one party state end of things went exactly as I had hoped it would, so that was cool. The litigation part wasn't so promising, but I sort of expected that, and honestly didn't want to get caught up in court anyway, so we were sticking with plan A: bluff.

Next I call my uncle, I explain the situation, and he says that he can get to the precinct to pick up what I need and have it over to me within the hour. I text my landlord and let him know that we have to talk.

My uncle drops the recording device off about an hour later, and that they definitely hadn't seen anyhing, but I damn well better hire an exterminator before they migrate to the other apartments. I let him go on about this shit for a while, then tell him that he's gonna stop talking for a few minutes and just listen to me.

I explain the conversations I had with the two other tenants, and read the information about a landlord's responsibilities in this situation directly off of the Department of Housing's (Heath? I forget, it's been a while) website. I stop, and ask him if he'd be willing to get this handled now that I know he's lying.

His response? ""I can lie all I want, but cool... you roll with that homey), and he's an 'upstanding citizen,' so nobody will believe me."" Dumb fuck. I tried to give him a chance... so be it.

At that point I tell him that he should google ""one party state

1) We would pay no rent till the apartment is treated and declared bug free by exterminators of my choosing. A good buddy of mine actually works for a sort of high class exterminator... he's told me stories about treating roach and rat problems for actors and Major League Baseball players. Not cheap

2) Once the apartment was declared bug free, so fuck him.

3) We would be paid for the clothing and furniture that had to be thrown away. I wanted a new couch before this anyway.

4) Our security deposit would be returned three-fold regardless of the condition of the apartment. We were paying $1, plus some stereo equipment, a new bong, and a nice chunk of cash in the savings I account I shared with my then girlfiend (now wife).

All of these conditions were to be met or I would be taking him to court for a bunch of shit I made up and can't remember now that sounded great at the time. To be quite frank, I wouldn't have played hardball... but fuck it, may as well go for a touchdown, you know?

Holy fucking hell did it work. This motherfucker literally showed up at my door bawling, and I didn't understand what spending all the money I was demanding what do to him. I told him that it's not my problem and that he owns two homes that he can take second mortgages out on if he's short on cash, because if this goes to court it's gonna cost him a lot more. Eat it fucker, I can lie through my teeth too.

You could have knocked me over with a fucking feather when he responded to this by breaking out his checkbook,600 is $3,600. I got another check for $1,500 (bringing the total to just over $5k) on the day we moved out to cover the furniture we had to toss. Asshole thought I had forgot about that part, and it looked like he shit himself when I brought it up as I was returning the keys hahaha. We're actually moving out of the apartment we moved to after that one this summer (this was just under four years ago), and we're gonna wind up paying a chunk of the new place's security deposit with some of the money haha... thanks dickbag! I'm happy to say that I haven't seen a bedbug (aside from on r/whatisthisbug) since shortly before we moved out, a few weeks after all of this went down. I also took my uncle, and buddy who works for the exterminator out for drinks. To be fair I should have made the exterminator pay though; he was in sales at this point and I think that he got a sick commission out of the deal hahaha.

The funniest part is that if he tried to play hardball, using a company that probably would have cost a fraction of what he wound up paying. Oh well!

TL;DR: Moved into a building that had a bedbug infestation, then extorted the living shit out of him even though I had a good deal of ammo but no real gun to load up with it.

**The backstory**

The long story is in the post if anyone is interested

In 2009, we got caught in a blizzard and gale force winds pushed my Jeep just far enough to catch the snow berm and flip us.  A trooper got us to the closest town to the accident, about 40 miles from home, after midnight.

**The plan**

After many calls, he just gave it back and said that he wasn't going to take it.  Over the next few days, I kept trying to give him the cash, but he wouldn't take it.

I decided I wasn't going to put up with his shit anymore

**The revenge**

In the 2-3 weeks that followed, stuffed into his cupholder or sticking out of the seat of his car, wherever I could stealthily put cash.  My favorite was sticking one between the sun visor and roof of his truck, which took him a couple weeks to find.

1356880520.0,15oarh,Math: The Best Way to Get Rid of a Roommate,ShaneL79,1387,217,59,"Early in my relationship with my wife (then gf) we did the long distance thing. She had a two bedroom apartment but was living by herself. Then one of her ""friends"" needed a place so she offered up her second room. I was down every other weekend and since I was working I paid the cable/phone/internet bills and always bought groceries - mainly for my wife but the roommate benefited from that as well. The roommate happened to be dating a good friend of mine and he usually stayed there a couple nights a week despite having an apartment not too far away. 

About 6 months into this arrangement and after returning home to massive parties several times we received a note on my wife's bedroom door. It read (shortened version): ""ShaneL79 must pay 1/3 rent and bills since he regularly stays here. I would like that amount to be returned from this months and last months rent/bills"". 

My wife was definitely annoyed and shocked that she would make demands. She was even more shocked that she wanted those demands to be retroactive. My wife decided to write up the greatest response letter I've ever read. It said:

*""Dear (Roommate)

*I have considered your demands and have decided that it would only be fair if we both charge our house guests for their stays. I also do not think it is fair that ShaneL79 pays our $200/month cable/phone/internet bill and still has to pay to stay when he visits while your guests do not. So I have included that bill in my calculations. Rent is $800/month

*The new

*Last month ShaneL79 stayed here 4 days for a total of $54 he owes us. This month he will be here 6 days for a total of $81 he will pay for staying here.* 

*Last month (roommates boyfriend) stayed here 8 days

*Your parents stayed for 10 days last month and since there were two of them

*So that leaves us with our portions. Since we are responsible for the entire month, and $10/day when there is 4 of us here.* 

*Last month there were only 2 of us here for 8 days ($160/each)

*This month there will be only 2 of us for 11 days ($220/each)

*Since we are responsible for our guests

*That brings your total from last month to $730 ($422 + $108 (BF) + $200 (parents)). My total is $476 ($422 + $54 (ShaneL79).*

*This month your current total is $652 ($476.50 + $94.50 (mom) + $81 (BF)). My total is $557.50 ($476.50 + $81 (ShaneL79))*

*Since you already paid $500 last month and this month

*Thanks.""*

Needless to say she completely expected her roommate to move out after reading that. They had been having some arguments leading up to this whole event so the roommates note was the final straw for my wife. The problem is her roommate waited until rent day to give her notice that she was moving out that day

While my wife was at school her roommate moved her stuff out without a mention of where she could be reached. So my wife called her roommates parents and explained the situation about a week later (giving her roommate enough time to re-surface). That same night her roommate returned and paid her $500. 

Needless to say they are no longer friends. 

One night shortly after we were at my friends house (her bf) for a party and I jokingly handed him $20 and said ""in case your gf wants us to pay cover for visiting you"". That was the first time he had heard the story. As far as he was aware



**TL;DR** - Roommate demanded money from house-guest who was already paying bills. Roommate didn't realize she had guests more often and it was explained to her using math in a way that showed she owed more money by her own logic. The intention of the lesson was to kick her out.

The neighborhood itself wasn't bad at all. It was mostly other kids

Now Walter and Jesse were brothers, loud, violent, drug dealers. Everyone hated them, but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while, strung out, from there front yard.

We pretty much fell in line (at first). They would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am. We'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn. Huge fucking parties that would go on for days. And to our chagrin

Well up arrives march, but goddammit, that's my $500 dollars and I'm gonna fucking buy something for me. Everything has gone to college and bills and I want to splurge. I go out and buy a 42"" LCD TV. It's a VIZIO, but it's the first HDTV I've ever had. My friends and I set it up, and oh boy did we have fun that week. And only that week, for that's as long as I had it.

The Meth bros decide they're gonna shoot their BB gun at whatever the fuck they can see. At birds, and especially windows. Well one little BB decided to go straight through my window and hit my TV, cracking it while I was playing some MW2. My face dropped and I heard laughing. Which then immediately turned to death threats if I called the cops. Now I know they had real guns. They had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them.

My friends and I were all disappointed at the turn of events. And both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it. But nay

I saved up every gatorade bottle I purchased for about 3 weeks. And every other day I would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one

I waited for a night when both of them were gone. It was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep. I had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior

I go back inside and into my room. I hear them going off. BOOM. BOOM. One of my roommates wakes up and goes ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""

BOOM. He wakes my other roommate (his room was closer) and there both freaking out. BOOM. Time to put my game face on. I scramble on out of there and react visibly scared. BOOM. I look at them and tell them to call the cops. BOOM. BOOM. He calls 911 and tells the cops he hears explosions. I go outside and pretend to look like I'm trying to find out what's going on. BOOM. I tell my friend that it's coming from next door. BOOM. He tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller. BOOM. BOOM. I tell him there's a bunch of smoke coming from outside. BOOM. They tell us to stay inside. BOOM. The last one goes off. We close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold.

They came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers. We told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did.

He was your typical bully. He would make sly remarks towards people
Everyday on the way home from school I would walk for about half a mile to this bus stop where I would sit and wait for my mother to come and pick me up. It was the worst time of the day. Andrew and all his horrible friends would always walk past and feel the need to say something horrible to me to try and get me to react. I would just ignore them as I was never the bravest outgoing kid and the idea of a fight really scared me. One Thursday he and his little group of social rejects decided to stop and intimidate me while I was at the bus stop. They would do this from time to time, gay. This went on for a few minutes until Andrew came up to my face and spat on me. He had always been mean to people but I had never experienced anything like that before. I had no idea how to react. His friends were all egging me on the punch him as they clearly wanted to see him kick my ass, but I was too in shock to really do anything. They left shortly afterwards as I wiped my face furiously. I got in the car with my mother when she arrived shortly after, went home and locked myself in my bedroom and just cried. I had never felt that humiliated and weak in my life.

The next day was a Friday and we had to finish off our IT Coursework for that year. For those of you who might not know IT is basically a dumbed down version of Computer Science. It involves a little bit of Word and Excel but nothing too strenuous. The entire day was dedicated to us finishing this off and handing it in by the three o'clock deadline. I had already finished mine and just intended to sit around all day talking to friends. Andrew came into the class grunting something about how he couldn't be bothered to do anything

For the actual revenge itself you have to understand the type of school I went to. To put it bluntly it was crap. The IT department was one room of about 30 computers, and voila his computer shut down. 
     I was so happy. He started ranting and raving and swearing. He told the teacher but the teacher must of thought Andrew was just being the little brat he was and making excuses not to work. The nasty bully went on to try other computers but no matter which one he loaded up I kept shutting down his computer. He was getting so furious

&gt;Who should be pulled over on the cross street on the right? Fancy cadillac lady. The bus driver gets excited,' and the bus driver responds, 'Is running a red light still illegal here?' The cop laughs, 'Sure is,' hands her his card,'are you willing to testify in court?'

1370052157.0,1ffxy3,The gasps behind the glass doors,alyx,1387,255,60,"Last year I took the train home after bringing my husband's car into service station. As I live one station from the airport I chose a good time and thought it wouldn't be that crowded. I was surprised to find the whole train nearly empty. A few minutes later a guy entered the train with a whole bunch of luggage. There were like 8 huge bags and suitcases and by the sweat on his forehead I could tell it was a heavy load. I offered my help but he would refuse.

He was arranging his luggage so everyone could easily pass by, pointed to a small sign that said handicapped people only and claimed the seats saying she was handicapped. She started flipping off the guy in a very rude way.
The guy instantly got up

I felt sorry for the guy and this time he accepted my offer to help him move the luggage. I was boiling inside and I couldn't believe my eyes when she stood there for a whole minute watching us move the bags instead of sitting down with the kid.

The woman mentioned the airport a few times so I thought it would be their destination. I don't know why I didn't get out when I arrived at my stop but my guts told me I'd miss something and it was maybe my time to shine in a petty revenge... so I stayed for the airport stop and helped this guy bringing all the luggage to the door. When the door opened he jumped out and I passed him one suitcase after another and hell

""Let me out of the train
She yelled at me and started pushing me (which makes me fucking furious, I got your back here"". 

The doors shut and once they're shut there's no way back. The train slowly departed and I was in shock, gasping... and I will never forget her swollen red face of anger and rage, oddly no horror or fear.

We talked to the kid and I took him to a cafe where he called his mom (which wasn't the woman in the train) and she came shortly after to pick him up. The kid told her the story and exaggerated a little too much

Fun Fact 1:  The woman was far away from being handicapped

Fun Fact 2: I chose the cafe next to the escalator so we could see this 'care taker' to come back with the next train to search for the 10 year old kid she's responsible for. Lady kept no-show. What kind of person does that? 

**TLDR:** Care taker harrasses a guy in a train, stays at the airport train station.

I had this lazy bitch of a woman working with me one evening. She was the only person who didn't help other servers at all. In fact I think she put more effort into not helping then the actual act of helping would have taken. 

There was another policy at this restaurant where you can't leave until the closing server checks your section and your side duties to make sure they are all done. Now this lazy bitch, Amy. Jen usually got to leave early without cleaning her section leaving the mess for other servers to clean up before Amy would allow them to leave.

One day I was called in to close the restaurant. It was Amy's birthday and they needed someone to cover her shift that she booked off. I jumped at the opportunity

That evening I cut all servers except Jen. I made sure that each of their sections were left messy and their side duties were not done. They were fine with leaving a mess for Jen because she had done it to them so many times. 

When Jen's last table left she came and asked me to sign her out. I checked and every section was still an absolute mess, and she whined about needing to leave soon so she could make it to Amy's party.

She rushed and did a half-ass job of everything. I checked it with a fine tooth comb and made her re-do it. Again, but it took her three hours to do that and she missed the better part of the party.

So I used to work at one of those large retail home-improvement stores as a cashier, I found myself in that situation and I panicked.

**THE ACT**
I had been doing well with no hiccups at the customer service desk, ghetto, and overall unpleasant lady came around the corner with a cart filled with the largest and most expensive cans of wood stain that we sold. My suspicions were already up since she came around the wrong way and not through the front entrance. She makes eye contact with me, and slowly lugs her heavy cart up to my register. Now this bitch then starts to tell me this bullshit story about how she had left over stain from a project and that she didn’t have a receipt, but she would gladly give me her drivers license and take a store credit. At this point I tell her I need to call a manager to get an override for a return of that amount, but when I try to call their phone they wouldn’t answer. I called one of the head cashiers next (the head cashiers were basically glorified cashiers who told people to go to their lunches and breaks) and told him I have to get an override for a return over $100. He simply replied, “Ok I’ll be right there” and hung up. Now this ghetto bitch starts to get all flustered and tells me I need to hurry up. I scan all of the stain in her cart and the total came out to be $636.48, I tried to signal to him that this lady was suspicious-as-fuck

**MY REVENGE**
As soon as she got out of the doors, by some random happenstance, I looked down next to my register by the phone and see a lone merchandise card. The cards are usually in a pile on top of my register so I pick this one up and look at the back to see if it had been used. Sure enough the security code had been peeled off, which meant it had been activated. My heart started racing, I grabbed the card and went to check the system to see if that was the card I put the return on. I swiped the card and up on the screen pops, “Remaining Balance: $636.48”. Somehow I had grabbed an empty merchandise card on accident and gave that to the ghetto bitch. I gleefully go to the purchase screen and ring up the same items and used the card and re-bought the stain so our store sustained no loss. My day went on and I had no other problems, until the same ghetto bitch comes storming up to my register again. This time she looked livid as hell and started yelling at me with vengeance. Apparently she had tried to buy some top line power drills with her card, and so I made sure I wasn’t going to screw this one up. I look at her dead in the eyes and make up the best bullshit story I could think of at the time. “Ma’am

I was left with some easy stuff (wheel changes, trip computer installation, and a few final builds to have out on the floor.

A guy comes in (Forshadowing!) and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a handlebar on his bike. We, so I told him it would be around $20. He didn't seem very happy, but said that was ok. He says he will go get the bike out of his car.

What he brought in was a bike in a box. As in completely unassembled.

Me ""sir

Old Cranky Bastard (OCB) "" and?""

Me 'Sir

OCB "" well

Me ""Well, a full assembly is $120...""

OCB ""WHAT?! That is NOT the price you quoted me!"" (What is this

Me ""Sir, make sure it all is in working order, and perform our safety check""

OCB ""I don't want any of that shit. Just put it fucking together.""

Me ""I am sorry

OCB ""WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!""

Me ""he is at the front desk""

Now, but would tend to side with the customers on most things. He was pretty good at finding a compromise, however.

A few miniuets later

After a few minuets of yelling and grumbling, I am not really happy that we had to cater to this guy, but I don't sign the checks. Doesn't really matter too much to me how much we make off of him. He still looks pissed however.

So, after working on this bike for around 40 minuets, the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet.

Of course we aren't!

He then starts screaming at us to take it all apart, telling us that we are just wage monkeys (he actually said that haha).

My manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out. So he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box.

Which is exactly what I did. I took this thing apart in the most heinous way possible

So

The icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store. Apparently

Guess what he had told them?

That he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on.

When I was in elementary school, I could vividly imagine the taste and texture of both the liquid and the chewables and I *knew* it would make me puke. She kept insisting, I kept refusing. Eventually, she decided to force her hand. I don't think she poured any down my throat, but I think she yelled and intimidated my small self into taking some and loomed over me to make sure I finished all of it.

Now

Almost right away after being forced to ingest Pepto Bismol, I only made it as far as the hallway right outside of my mom's bedroom door. Hot pink vomit poured out of me, all over the freshly cleaned white carpet. Hot pink vomit, right outside her bedroom.

I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid.

Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""

I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement

I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However

I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot
At one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasn't done, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it.""

This story though

When I was 17

After getting my first paycheque and being short 8 hours I realized why it was so important. But the owner assured me the hours would be on my next cheque. 

I had worked there for about 2 months before being promoted to evening manager

Things started getting really shitty. Some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the 3 remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift. We were also really short on staff so I ended up working the counters in the mornings (7-10) alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift (3-11). Apparently my raise was only in name because my last 2 paycheques had my former salary on them

Then came stampede. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Calgary stampede, the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra bodies but only one staff came in. 

Breakfast was a nightmare. A&amp;W breakfasts are real breakfast made to order, French toast, none of it premade and there was no time to premake it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock, so with 1 person full time in back and one floater it was taking 8+ minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street. We called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us. We were drowning in angry customers. 

30 minutes pass and we call him again. ""I'll be there right away"" is his famous line. Another 30 minutes and he's not here

It's now 10am, but we haven't had a chance to prep lunch, not even cut up the veggies for burgers so we were still fucked come lunch. 

I look at the day manager and said fuck it, the only one that doesn't is the 1 kitchen staff) and we will stay for another 30 minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out. 

30 minutes pass and no word from the owner. We lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served

We serve at lease 50 free breakfasts (at around $10 a piece) once the store is empty we do our cash out, but the cash out in the safe and left. People were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door, confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during stampede. 

I didn't get a call until 2 hours later (after the lunch rush) from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was closed/for the free breakfasts. I told him he was well informed about what was going to happen

Not only did we make sure that some of the staff actually got paid what they were owe (costing hundreds) but he probably lost out on $15

When I was 15/16 I worked at a local video rental place. It was privately owned and was bootleg as hell - pretty sure the owner used it as a front for something shady, yuppy town (Concord MA) and 90% of our business consisted of local soccer moms bringing their kids in for a movie night. Most of these women were terrible people - overlords to their spoiled flock who would throw credit cards around without thinking twice and would condescend everyone they deemed ""beneath"" them.

We had a very basic computer system at the time, or to lower the fees if they thought it appropriate. Generally speaking, I was the guy who would waive any &amp; all late fees - reason being that my boss was a cheap fuck, and I didn't worry at all about making money for him... if the customer was nice to me I'd waive their fees, no questions asked. Anyway... One day this woman comes in with a bunch of kids, if I remember correctly it was 5-6 roughly 12-13 year old boys. The kids were running around, pulling things off the shelves, punching each other, and just figured I'd clean up the mess when they left.

So the woman finally comes up to the counter with like 8 different movies, saying something like ""excuse me, ma'am...ma'am?"" while her back is turned. She gestures me off. So I stand there and do nothing, waiting. She finally hangs up a minute or so later, turns to me and says something snarky like ""well what's taking so long??""

So I explain, doesn't pay fees, and that she herself has done no wrong and the fees should be cleared and she should be able to rent etc etc. I nod but say, ""this account still owes $120 and I can't allow you to rent until it's paid. Company policy ma'am, I'm sorry but I don't make the rules.""

She starts going off again, for reasons unknown to me, would only read a magnetic strip correctly if you wrapped the card in a plastic grocery bag. I couldn't explain to you why, but it was the only way the damn thing worked.

So, and asked if she had cash. She didn't, and she was ripshit about the card. I showed her the receipt saying ""Card Not Accepted"" and feigned indifference. She asked (er, violently demanded) that she speak to a manager. I happily informed her that I was the manager on duty and was indeed the only employee in the store. She stormed out and walked across the street to the bank... came back a few minutes later with the money and practically threw it at me. I took the payment.... and said ""now, about those overdue movies... I don't suppose your daughter would like to return them for you so you can rent these movies?"" I got the worst death glare I think I've ever received (and my mother can practically shoot lasers from her eyes) and the woman abandoned her stack of movies and stomped out. Not sure if we ever saw her again but at the time 15 year old me was so proud of myself for staying cool under pressure and fucking with this woman.

1363211308.0,1a8ryh,Take away a day of my honeymoon? I'll make you buy everyone breakfast. (long but good),penguin_2,1306,271,97,"I got married a couple of years ago, that was what was supposed to happen.

**The Beginning**

For some reason, the last flight to Jamaica for the day had already left, so we had to spend the first night of our honeymoon in a Best Western instead of the all inclusive resort I had shelled out for.

**The Complaint**

Since we're on our honeymoon, and then I actually take a good look at the meal vouchers the airline gave us. Two vouchers, each worth $6, for a total of $12 for the two of us. The cheapest thing on the menu at the restaurant was $10.

So I was mad. Instead of being on a tropical beach with my new bride, I wasn't obnoxious, but I was forceful. I told the attendant that the vouchers weren't even worth enough to buy a plate of nachos, and asked him what they could do about it. The attendant looked sympathetic, and told me he would go talk to his supervisor to see what he could do.

**Victory 1**

So I waited. He was gone for almost 15 minutes. I was starting to think that he had either forgotten about me or was avoiding dealing with me, he handed me a whole *stack* of meal vouchers, 25 of them, each worth $6. I thanked the man profusely for his help and returned to the restaurant feeling victorious.

**Victory 2**

Meanwhile, we ordered and ate, and then gave the vouchers to the waiter to settle the check. When he returned he told us that in addition to the food, he had gone ahead and put our drinks on the vouchers as well, which he wasn't really supposed to do. So the entire meal plus drinks was free. I gave him a *really* good tip (cash, of course, not vouchers).

**The Revenge**

So at some point I started reading the vouchers carefully. I'm not a lawyer but I am pretty good at understanding legalese, so if we didn't use them before we took off in the morning, we wouldn't be able to use them at all. Second, nowhere on the vouchers did it say ""non-transferable"".

When we got to the airport in the morning, ask them if they'd had anything to eat yet today, and if they said no, I handed them a voucher and told them to, ""Go buy breakfast, Delta's paying."" If they had kids, I gave them 2. I kept at it until I was out of vouchers.

**Post Script**

On the way back to the US from Jamaica, and let us keep the vouchers.

So a while ago, we'll get you in there; if not, we get all your info, take your luggage, and give you a call as soon as your room is ready. 

So on this day, go to the convention and grab the keys for their room when the day ends, around 5. Not this woman. She'd tried to check in at 10 am, got annoyed that her room wasn't ready, and then proceeded to check back once or twice an hour. Each time she asked, myself or my co-worker would tell her, ""We'll call you when it's ready."" 

She comes up AGAIN, ""There has to be ONE clean room by now,"" and at this point I was willing to bend my ""don't reward bad behavior"" policy and upgrade her into whatever room was available just to get her out of my face. We had oversold the convention rate rooms by a few rooms anyway (low floor, views blocked by other buildings, usually not as quiet because of street noises) so we were going to have to upgrade a couple of people anyway, so I thought: fuck it. She's huffing and puffing about how long she's waited and SURELY there is a clean room by now, and I check the computer. There is fabulous corner room (a bit bigger with massive windows on two side) on a high floor with a spectacular view. It's one of our coveted rooms

So I tell her, and..."" Before I can finish, she throws her purse on the counter. 

""MY ROOM IS READY? I HAVE BEEN WAITING HERE FOR HOURS! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE CALL ME! YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALL!""

""YES, so she could see what had (not really) happened. 

Again, actually laughing at me, and I am now flummoxed. She wants free stuff and is not going to back down. She called my bluff.  Suddenly, it dawns on me. 

""Ma'am, ""And the number is 555-555-5554, right? We, let me just call it and see what the issue is."" 

Now her face freezes, ""Is it ringing? It's ringing on my end. Could you check it? Maybe you have some missed calls?"" 

She doesn't answer, and I am not about to let her have this room. Instead, I find one of the dreaded ""25"" rooms. These are rooms that we never give out unless we are sold out; they are right next to the elevator, they are tiny, they have no desk, and they don't even have closets. Just little armoires.

So one day this lady comes in, coffee rolls cost more than donuts and I don't make the prices.  I put the change in her hand and the receipt on the counter, but make note of the fact that she's reading our little ""receipt or your money back"" sign.

About 45 minutes later I'm in the way back of the store, but it's just that lady from earlier, claiming she didn't get a receipt and she wants her refund.  Well, I knew for a FACT that I laid it on the counter.  My coworker has already gone through all of our trash bins and couldn't find it.  On a hunch I went to a nearby trash bin at the store's pharmacy.  I dig through some papers, half-drank coffees and half-eaten donuts and find the receipt, which she'd clearly taken and thrown out herself, and hold it out for her to take.

""That's not my receipt.""

""Ma'am, 6 frosted.  I know this because I've been here since 5:30 this morning when I unpacked them myself.  We now have 5 plain, 6 frosted.  This is your receipt, which somehow migrated to the trash on your side of the counter despite your never having received it.  I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Have a nice day.""

While in college, so I had to become a pro at sneaking minutes here and there for questions about class(with a lot of walk-and-talks) and sent a lot of emails. Most professors were incredibly understanding. One? Not so much.  
**The offense:**  
After class
 
Me: ""Hi

Me: ""Of course
Prof: ""Ugh
Me: ""Right
Prof: ""Look. Let me make it perfectly clear. I have clearly defined office hours when you can come by and ask me any question your heart desires.""

Prof: ""Yes yes
Me: sigh ""of course

**The Revenge:**  
A week of so later, colorful language and a mournful ""this is why I hate computers"" later, the prof was unable to get the display to come back up. Irritatedly, his eyes swept the classroom until he found me.

Prof: ""You! You work in IT

Prof
Me: ""Yes, keeping to a schedule is VERY important.""

The classroom was dead silent and the professor stood there, nearly verbatim, and he just started laughing, tears streaming down his face.  
When he finally composed himself, ""and ONLY you, can ask me questions outside of office hours. No one else. Now will you PLEASE come fix this?""  
Me: ""Of course

**End of Prologue**

**Set Up to the Revenge**
I was delivering a pizza and cinnapie to a customer. Pretty routine. I had delivered there once before earlier that week, which is shitty because of how far she lived. I got there and found her sitting on her front porch with two of her friends and her son. I took her order out of my trunk and before I even reached her, she loudly exclaimed ""Where is my soda?""

I double checked her receipt and said there was no soda on her order, I did order a soda."" I asked how she ordered and she said by phone. Well, I assumed whoever took her order just accidently forgot the soda or just didn't hear it. Human error, it happens. At least she wasn't charged for it. I told her I could call the restaurant and get this fixed, but she straight up told me not to even bother and that she would do it.

Well, my manager offered her the same offer I did, fix the order and have me drive all the way back to the restaurant and back with her Mountain Dew, which she was all for until she heard how long it could potentially take. You see, I wasn't going to just go back and come right back with a soda. No, I would have to wait for my next delivery to be ready before I could leave. She wasn't having it. Up until that point, she kept on going on and on about how she can't eat pizza with something to drink. In my mind, ""well, shit happens, while all of this is going on

Finally, she just continued to treat me like I wasn't even there.

**The Revenge**
Her order was on a credit card. Company policy for all drivers is to check the card and a form of ID before handing over the order to ensure this isn't identity theft. After all that

""I'm sorry
""Well
""Well, but I can't let you have this order then.""

Oh, I would let her have the food. She told me her husband worked about an hour away, there was no way for her to do that. I told her this was all I could do and she was furious.

""I'm gonna report you to your supervisor!"" Oh
""I'm gonna get you fired!"" All my managers love me
""I'm never ordering from you again."" Good

I got back to the restaurant with the order

Customer was upset over a little mistake on her order

However, the workers eventually begin to pull him and his friend out, but not before the guy spat on every open seat on the roller coaster. At this point he had held up the ride for about 15 minutes and there's nothing worse than impatient Canadian ride warriors.

Best part? While he was getting up his phone dropped out of his pocket, my buddy and I who were both front seat in our train and front seat in the action yelled at the employee that his phone was right there. The worker went and picked it up, held it up for everyone to see and he whole queue line just cheered and laughed at this dope. The worker even pretended to drop kick the phone out of the station. The worker then went to put it in the lost and found and when our spray tanned amigo came storming back for his ""brand new s4"", every single person acted like they didn't know what happened. Of course, security comes at this point and escorts the two out of the park.

When my mother was in primary school (about 6 or 7 years old), rich-and-obnoxious girl from her school (who was already on the path to becoming a total bitch) decided it was a good idea to inform my mother that the party dress she was wearing was hideously ugly, because it had been handmade by my grandmother rather than having been bought from a store like hers. She continued to rub my mum's nose in her comparative poverty and insult my grandma's work at length, before eventually getting bored and deciding to go find someone else to be a bitch to.

A few years ago I went back to school to get another BA because the first time around my GPA could be charitably called ""aggressively mediocre"" and I really wanted to go to grad school. My wife had a full time job at the time so I didn't need to get a part time job or anything but I get bored easily. I applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasn't particularly demanding work. It was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking IDs of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest. It was part of the campus safety initiative. Most of the time I just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last call—this is in Canada so it's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age. Occasionally

As an aside

Anyway, I approach the car slowly, like I'm sneaking up on it. I discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive. I've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud, blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd. It's better to sneak up on the car, confirm that it is, in fact, illegally parked (or has an expired pass), write the ticket

&gt;Be me

&gt;Use stealthy ticket

&gt;It is very effective

I wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off. I did another walk around the rear parking lot and then, get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke. I'm standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg)—I don't actually know what these things are called—drink in one hand, sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket, smoke in the other hand, and just zone out. Next thing I know there's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly. I zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the M3. He's this skinny dude, wearing a [puffy vest](http://www.gap.com/products/res/thumbimg/quilted-puffer-vest-blue.jpg), and he's got fancy hair. I figure he's probably 18 or 19. 20 tops. He's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he's all, fuck fuck, fuck

While he's swearing and having a bit of a spaz

Oh wait, parking ticket printer slung across my chest. Well shit. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be at the end of your shift

&gt;Expect to be yelled at by Puffy Vest Fancy Hair


I steel myself for the eventual tirade. Policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations. Our interactions should consist of ""yes sir/ma'am"", sir/ma'am"" but overall being firm about why they received a ticket.  He swings his vision around several times but doesn't seem to spot me. I'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory, blue, campus security jacket, and a *ticket printer*. He keeps looking around. Left. Right. Left. Right.

I take another drag.

For whatever reason, *and heads back into the building*.

So, half-full medium double-double—the old medium, not the new upsized medium—with one drag left on my smoke. So I finish my smoke, feed the pawn, and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich. I'm sitting on the bench, eating my sandwich, drinking my coffee

""I'm gonna finish my sandwich, and then I'm going to give him another ticket"", says I to myself.

""It's a trap""

""I dunno man

""I'm just saying""

""How could it be a trap? What

""Do whatever you want

My brain made a valid point. This would be an excellent trap. I pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth

No sign of Puffy Vest Fancy Hair. With one hand I start typing out the ticket on the printer but don't press the ""print"" button yet—if I hit the button it saves the data and there's no way to undo it once that happens. I wasn't yet ready to commit to this course of action. I finish my second cigarette

Nothing happens.

No ambush.

No screaming.

No Puffy Vest Fancy Hair.

All that buildup for nothing.

I check my phone—if I recall correctly, get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area, and I hope that this kid isn't in a three hour class. I'm now here for a show. I'm going to get yelled at, it'll be a huge scene, I'll have to be all professional about it, but seeing Puffy Vest Fancy Hair have another spaz is totally worth it.

""You're an idiot""

I let my coffee cool just for a bit before I take a swig. Of course

""WHO THE FUCK DID THIS?!""

""WHAT THE FUCK?!!""

There's Puffy Vest Fancy Hair: Sack of fast food in one hand, trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm. He's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by. For some reason, he still hasn't spotted me. I'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing. I am right beside the smoking pawn, wearing a blue jacket that says ""Campus Security"" on it. I have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest. For some reason, his gaze never lingers on me at all. After a few more seconds of spazzing, he gets in his car, throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away.

Why he didn't see me is inexplicable. The only hypothesis I have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else. Maybe a [high visibility vest](http://www.legionsafety.com/high-visibility-safety-vests.jpg) or maybe something [like this](http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/pics/interceptor.JPG)

I don't recall how much those tickets  run (a few hundred I think) but that kid had one expensive day. My boss did tell me that the kid's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets. I had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because I figured he'd probably ask my why I wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day. My boss explained to the kid's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle, it counted as a separate parking incident, thus, two tickets were warranted.

So the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her. So i carry on working the rest of the shift
I call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty. So when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i ""couldnt be arsed to work"" and i was going to lie to get the day off.
Manager pulls me aside bollocks me. He spreads around work i lied to get the day off.

The same day the manager bollocks me

So by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice. i then decided i was going to have some fun with it.

**REVENGE**

So then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine (Something he said he takes all the time) from me. I will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy. I hinted that i would have about half a kilo (LOL).

So when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room. By the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room. Then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug sniffer dog. I get made to open my locker and empty my bag. During this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking. Also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to.

No drugs in my bag.

his mum gets demoted for calling in the search
he gets the sack and trys to fight me. 
he gets arrested for assault. 
he gets 7 months in prison.

So my parents work in the same city, only 4 or 5 years old at the time.

They decide to meet for lunch. My mom arrives to the restaurant first, some guy flies into the parking spot next to her, opens his door, and *bang*. His door hits the car mom was driving. 

She does the reasonable thing, politely asks for insurance information (the dent was big enough, car was nice enough, it might've cost more than the deductible). The guy looks at the huge dent, and says ""It's not that big of a deal, don't worry."" And he just walks into the store without another word. 

Shit. What the hell just happened? Mom panics, and is now eating in the restaurant they are planning to eat at. She feels terrible. So she calls dad, and tells him what happened, worried he will be mad. He says only this, ""Move your car."" 

""What? Why? Don't you want to eat somewhere else?""

""Just move your car.""

So she moves. A minute or two later, grabs the door handle, and SLAM. SLAM. SLAM SLAM SLAM. He hits this guys car with his door, hard, over and over until it is obvious the door is *fucked*. 

Then, and dad never heard about it again. I assume this guy didn't have any insurance at all.

Flash forward to the festival. We played 3 songs. I don't remember them too well, I started the solo off beautifully. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I see a bright white light, like one of those keychain flashlights. This distracted me a thew off my timing very noticeably. As I was walking off stage, I could feel my director's eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. 

After the performance, I walked down to the bandroom and explained what had happened. He asked if I could identify who had done it. I didn't get a good look at the kid, but I did see that it was someone in a group of Hispanics wearing floral shirts. The director said that he'd figure something out and I went on to watch the other bands perform.

The group of kids who messed up my solo weren't just spectators who decided to color coordinate for the day. It turns out that they were a percussion ensemble who had came from Miami, I relayed the information to my director, who passed it on to the high school director.

Apparently, the Miami director apologized to me and promised that if they find out who did it, that kid will face punishment. The next day, at the award ceremony, I found that the band had been disqualified for ""unsportsmanlike conduct"".

The campus is closed overnight so droparms come down at every entrance and the only way to gain access to campus is by swiping your ID badge at these roadside pedestals near the gatehouses.

For the first hour of my early morning shift, they all try to tailgate the first guy who badges in so they don't have to swipe their cards. I can't do anything about that. Worst still are the people who don't even stop at the pedestal; they drive right up to the closed droparms, expecting me to open it for them.

**Petty revenge #1:** So I just stopped opening it for them. I let them sit there as long as they want, I have some variation on this conversation with tools like that:

*Spoiled Adult:* ""Hey! Aren't you going to let me in?""

*Me:* ""Oh

*Spoiled Adult:* ""I'm not a visitor! I'm an employee! Don't you recognize me?"" (Note: I usually do recognize them but I've learned that nothing pisses off self-righteous people more than not acknowledging their status.)

*Me:* ""Sorry, all employees are required to badge in before 7am. If this is your first day, I'd be happy to direct you to the Photo ID Office."" (If they hate not being recognized as an employee, being called a ""dumb newbie"" is even worse to their egos.)

*Spoiled Adult:* ""It's not my first day!! I've worked here for over 20 years! I come through your gate all the time!""

*Me:* ""Good

*Spoiled Adult:* [indignant scoffing and/or obscenities

Even if there does start to become a line

**Petty revenge #2:** This happened the other day. One particular obscenely overweight female employee is always difficult to security and yesterday she kept speeding around campus and tailgating people -- though campus police can't do anything about it unless they catch her themselves. I tried to stop her whenever she came through my gate but she ignored me each time and I have no real authority to do anything else about it. Then

*Employee:* ""Hey

*Me:* (I look back and see the tailgater has hot take-out food in her passenger seat and is obviously in a hurry to get back to her office to eat it. I look back at the employee and notice he has his daughter in the backseat.) ""You know

*Employee:* ""Really? Well damn.. (Suddenly he seems to get an idea.) Hey

I tell him no and I smile as I realize what he's probably about to do. He turns to his daughter and asks her to tell me about *every single toy* she got for Christmas over the break

Meanwhile the tailgater is fuming inside her car behind them and tries to honk her horn. I give her the hand signal for ""hold on"" and go back to listening to the little girl. Eventually Tubby McLeadfoot gets fed up and does a U-turn to go in one of the other campus gates. As soon as she's gone and the girl finished her story

1361294712.0,18tsj0,Petty Revenge on an entitled little brat at a birthday party...,-not-that-guy-,1165,202,105,"My first post in r/pettyrevenge

My 4 year old daughter was invited to a birthday party for one of her little friends that just turned 5.  The party was hosted at an amusement center that has multiple bounce houses and other large inflatable slides and obstacle courses.  Parents are encouraged to partake in the activities with their children so you can help them if needed.  As a father that is very involved with my daughter and her activities I played in the bounce houses with her.

There was this one girl, I will refer to her as QB (Queen Brat).  QB had the attitude that if you didn’t do things her way, it was the wrong way.  Being that she was one of the older kids there she tried to get all the younger girls to follow her and do what she wanted to do.  Now imagine her displeasure when a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds don’t want to listen to her and do what they want.  QB immediately started acting out and being a general pain.  If she was going up a ladder to a slide, she would stop in the middle of the ladder and not let any of the other kids pass.  Seeing her actions, and me not being one to make a scene with a small child, I simply told my daughter to play somewhere that QB wasn’t currently causing problems. 

All was well until we were moved to another room with different bounce houses and activities.  As the kids are playing, I entered the bounce house with my daughter.  We started jumping and kicking some small soft balls around and the following conversation between me and QB occurred.

(Try to read QB’s side with an entitled attitude.  Try to read mine with a calm
QB: STOP JUMPING! I am trying to just lay here and rest…
Me: This is a bounce house and its meant to be jumped in.
QB: But I am trying to lay her by myself!
Me: Sorry
QB: THIS is the ONLY place for me to lay down!
Me: Go lay on the floor.

We continued jumping and playing with the balls that were in the bounce house and QB would try to grab and hold onto the balls to keep us playing with them.  This continued for maybe only 5 more minutes when my daughter wanted to move to another activity.  She started for the exit and QB decided that she wanted to exit first and pushed my daughter out of the way.  Before this

There was a small arcade machine in the corner of the room called the CYCLONE.  The cost of said machine was $2. You then stand inside said machine and close the circular door and then the machine creates a vortex of wind that supposedly simulates a cyclone.  There is even a wind speed indicator that tells you how fast the wind is blowing.  QB see this machine and starts playing with it

Take that QB

1354389065.0,1443ky,Being a dick? Get off the plane. You're not flying. ,JesusSwallows,1095,137,109,"This is my mom's story. She's been a flight attendant for almost 35 years now and has earned numerous accolades from her airline and high-level frequent fliers for her phenomenal service. I've never met anyone who works harder or who loves his/her job more.

She is an extremely patient person as well, however, post-9/11 the FAA granted flight attendants a lot more jurisdiction over whether P.A.L.D.s (Passengers Acting Like Dicks) fly or not. My mom hardly ever exercises this authority (certainly not as much as other flight attendants), but the douche canoe in this story earned it.

My mom was working her favorite trip - Portland to Maui - and was greeting passengers on a Thursday morning flight boarding in PDX. The airline had recently begun flying to Hawaii, even new Hawaii-themed uniforms for the flight crew). Everyone was in a great mood, passengers and crew, until this guy boards.

He's immediately rude, and obviously drunk off his ass. Behind him is his exasperated young wife, towing a horse-sized diaper bag and their two young, tired-looking kids. The guy remarks to my mom ""You gonna get those drinks comin', hun?"" and laughs like a loon as soon as he steps foot on the plane.

Once they get seated (the guy refuses to sit down or help his wife get their two kids situated), complete with LOUD profanity. There are a lot of families and young children on this flight, including his own.

All his antics so far are annoying, meaning a delay, meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel (this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling). Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times, the third request receiving a ""Jesus, calm the fuck down!""

Oh heeeeeelllll no. My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying she's booting him. This guy will only get drunker

But she remembers this flight's captain is Steve, and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job). Awesome guy who won't let anyone do anything to ""his girls"" -- and says so again to my mom. She heads back to deal with Asshat McGee.

She informs him, that the captain has deemed him a security risk, and that he must deplane. This guy naturally goes apeshit, screaming things like ""So you're gonna ruin my kids' vacation? What the FUCK!"" My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight, provided he deplanes peacefully (without security) and sobers up.

The guy continues his tirade, ""Ma'am, there is no need for you or your children to deplane. Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evening's flight."" The wife looks a bit torn for a second, then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice. ""Don't ruin this.""

My mom's been divorced, muttered ""Man, this is bullshit"", but deplaned. They were able to take off only 10 minutes behind schedule.

While the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving, but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her. My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landed.

A few weeks later

TL;DR my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucher.

I was driving into the city (it's a small city) on a two-lane road in the shopping area, driving quickly (this was a few years ago, I was still in that 'drives too fast' stage younger folks go through). There's very little traffic on the road, but one car behind me. 

The car behind me didn't seem any out of the ordinary, causing me to stab my brakes. I was just thinking ""WTF is with this guy"" to myself, wondering why they couldn't have just waited the extra 2 seconds to get into the turning lane behind me? The light at the intersection is red, so we're pulled up next to each other. I realize that there is a woman in the idiot-car with all the windows down yelling at me, so I roll down my window, she's saying ""What do you think you're doing, little boy?"" Which makes me laugh because I was in my early-20s, maybe early 40s

""HEY KID"" and he looks up at me, and just makes flabbergasted noises, then shrieks at me like a banshee, and turns left on a red arrow.

1362486079.0,19pbnd,"Dude who dumped me for ""lying""",bluescrew,1325,385,227,"This happened in 1998.

I was 17 and dated a 19-year-old, wore a suit to work (retail furniture) and drove a new truck. I was a complete virgin at this time but I read a lot of my mom's romance novels. We would make out standing behind his truck in my mom's driveway. He was the first person to go up my shirt.

One day he came over and asked me to sit on the front porch with him. I was excited to see him because I'd been grounded for sneaking out to meet him so he'd been going to the pool hall without me the past few nights. He asked if I knew someone named ""Lisa"" with long dark hair. I mentally went through everyone in my class. No Lisa. He kept asking me if I knew this chick. Finally he said he had met a girl named Lisa who knew me. She told him I was a super slut. He had already had his suspicions that I wasn't what I claimed to be because I was ""too good"" at making out to be a virgin. This only confirmed it. He also believed I was lying when I said I didn't know her. He did not want to be with me anymore. He took his garish class ring back and drove off in his truck. I cried for hours. Not because of losing him

The next day I was still thinking about it

*(Side note: Over the next couple months Josh noticed my little sister working at the movie theater at the mall. The way it's set up

Three months after the breakup I had an awesome new boyfriend. One night our plans got canceled and we went to the pool hall where I had hung out with Josh. I didn't see his shiny truck outside though

We weren't safe. Josh was there.

Worse

He wanted to apologize. To say he should have believed me. To say he's found out since then ""what kind of person"" Lisa is. To ask me to take him back.

I waited out his spiel. Calmly perched my fantastic ass on the edge of his pool table while he was talking. Finally he ran out of steam and I looked him in the eyes.

""It's okay

I pushed off

**Epilogue**

Here is what my sister told me later about him:

He had lost his job and was now working at McDonald's.

He had had to move back in with his parents.

He had had to give the truck to his uncle who took over the payments.

He still dated high school girls because no one older was gullible enough.

And here is what I have found out by accident about Lisa:

She shows up in the city paper's Most Wanted section from time to time for drug dealing

I've been with ""new boyfriend"" for 14 years now. We're married.

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
***The Prestige:***  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The End:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.

EDIT: This was in Southern Mississippi at the time.

When I was in 7th grade, The Legend of Zelda.)

I was spanked for many issues that were non-issues but a biased problem they had or came up with. I was always spanked by the vice principal, normally female.

One day, severely angered by the injustice that happened and said, ""you will never strike me again."" The female teacher who I had issues with and was the witnessing party said something along the lines of, ""we'll spank you until you finally learn your place."" I said with all the bitterness I could muster, ""The FUCK you wont!"" The assistant principal, who was paddling me at the time swung me back onto the desk and said, ""you just bought yourself three more licks.""

Before he could swing

I knew I was in deep shit, breaking everything in the room, the nicknacks on his desk, the windows, the phone, everything. I spent a good ten minutes in that room until the police arrived. I surrendered to them without any problem.

This led to the local media getting involved, and the fact that most of my teachers did not even have a college education.

I was expelled for the incident

It was worth having to repeat the 7th grade. I enjoyed public school from then on.

TL;DR: FUCK THEM ALL!

EDIT 1: Here's some FAQ:

To be honest

When they picked me up for the police station, if I get a spanking at school, I get a spanking at home. Keep in mind, this is the deep south Mississippi where Christian values overrules critical thinking and obvious logic.

It wasn't until the T.V. station called my parents and requested to do an interview with me or them. My parents refused, something that doesn't happen very often.

During my time off, I was diagnosed with some type of depression resulting from a repressive atmosphere, and that a drastic change was needed. This is when they decided to send me to public school. The problem with that was that my parents, during my private school days, used public school as a ""threat"" for problems related from school: poor grades, punishments, calls from teachers. They spun public school as a prison-like atmosphere in the roughest part of the ghetto where I would be surrounded by ""blacks."" (Keep in mind I'm the deep south of Mississippi, when the counselor recommended public school

As far as the teacher's lack of college degrees, all my former teachers either quit, or were switched to other position-titles that didn't require degrees like librarian and such. Either way, the school changed names to avoid confusion with this dilemma. (Ironically, the church under the same name as the school, kept its tarnished name.)

If it wasn't for the counselor or the television station's intervention into my already repressive life, but one of my best friends through high school was African-American, much to the dismay of my racist parents), and that my chaotic-problem child ways were nothing but the over-exaggeration of the private-school's staff.

With all that said, they have ""grown-out"" of their ultra-conservative ways. However, I do hold the staff from that school mainly-responsible for my lingering physiological problems (still have a streak of fear shoot through me every time I hear the phone ring at my parents house subconsciously believing it's a teacher calling to get me in trouble). I hope they have already, or will pay in the future, for the unnecessary damage they've caused me and my life.

It wasnt long into the wait that I began to take notice of a small group of children, being loud, and trying to one up each other on the amount of toys or games they had.


Unattended children already annoy me and here's a group of them stuck in the store with me.  Great.   But it got worse.


The loud brats kept going over to one phone in particular to play that ""Crank that"" song by Soulja Boy.  Sometimes back to back.  The amount of hatred that I have for that ""song"" is astronomical.  So they're just rubbing salt in the wound now.  And they wanted the whole store to hear.  They maxed the volume on the phone to the point where the speakers were bottoming out.  So yes


After about the 4th or 5th time of them circling back around to the phone and having a loud dance off


They all had their backs to the phone when I picked it up and the song suddenly stopped


Not one of them said a word and my focus stayed on the phone as I went through the menu and did a factory reset on the phone.


Feeling quite accomplished


The icing on the already delicious cake was when one of the kids went to their mother.  She was about what you would expect of someone that would let their kid annoy everyone in a store.  Around my age at the time


Fortunately for me, and the default setting for my face is an expression that always looks pissed off.  Its just the card Ive been dealt and Im always asked if Im mad at something and have to reply with a laugh and ""No, this is just my normal expression"".


So when I saw her squint in my direction


I could have stared straight at them while the kid whined


Pretty sure it worked because when I reacted to her look


Every so often I would catch her glancing in my direction

Last year

Due to working different hours, I would share, sometimes I wouldn't. Flatmate never bought snacks, but I was fine with this. Sometimes though, he would use the last of something we would share (toilet paper, for example), but would not replace it. This annoyed me.

So, salted pistachio nuts in shells, which I put in a bowl with the intention of them lasting a few days. The bowl is placed on the table in front of the couch and I tell Flatmate he could have some if he wants. Flatmate proceeds to eat some nuts and put the shells back into the bowl. No problem, except he keeps eating them and eating them until there are only about half left. By this point, I've only had about a handful and decide to tell him to take it easy, as I would actually like them to last - *pistachios aren't cheap*. He stops.

The next day, having specifically requested that he leaves some for me.

Knowing my flatmate

I took my revenge the next time he was out by distributing the empty shells throughout his bedroom and personal property, mattress, socks and toiletry bag amongst other things...like his milk and yoghurt. 

The pièce de résistance though, but hard enough that when you run in them, it's uncomfortable.

This is where Douchebag comes into play. Douchebag comes flying into the parking lot off the highway in his Nissan Versa. Cool car bro. Anyway


I was on my way back into the parking lot and he was on his way into the store when we crossed paths. He's probably in his late 20s or early 30s with a goatee, wifebeater and tatted arms. He looks at me and says, ""Watch where you're going with the carts, fatty.""

One day, my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed.

I can attest that she never had her fleece because

Anyway, she threw in some of my things too, including my uniforms and pricey, tech school t-shirts. When **L** joined me in bed for a bit, before I woke up early in the morning (this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh sand-tee to wear to work), **B** threw bleach in the dryer on (mostly) my clothes, ruining it all.

I suppose it could have been anyone. **L** said she had seen her up and about while **L** was doing stuff and hanging out with other night-shifters. Later on we did catch wind from one of her fickle friends that gave us some circumstantial evidence to further our assumption

My clothes were ruined. **L** lost some stuff too, if you will, who has some pull between family members) was unwilling to do much about it.

Everything seemed like it would be great.


It was right about a month after we moved in -- one morning I went to take my pill for the day, I was short by 10. I only take 1 a day, every morning before work at 7:30 AM on the dot, and I've never given any out, so I knew something was up.


I asked Ron about it casually, just curious!""


""Nope."" He sounded totally uninterested


""Alright man. Just checking."" I shrugged it off


Because of this theft, but it certainly threw me off at work. I work with computers and have to deal with quite a lot of text -- something that without Dexedrine I find almost impossible to do without my mind wandering haplessly.


When I finally got my prescription refilled, so that I could (hopefully) notice if any went missing with some sort of accuracy. Sure enough, when I counted for the second time, I noticed that there were 5 missing. I began to think it could be Ron; I usually keep the door to my room closed, and none of his friends seemed like the type who would go through a stranger's room.


On top of this, bodywash, toilet paper, and *towels*; and he was always so late on rent that I'd have to cover him for a couple weeks each month. He'd torrent things, stream videos, and use so much bandwidth that I could barely use the internet connection *I was solely paying for*. Ron was turning out to be not a very nice person.


I confronted him about the pills again


""No man


""Alright


""Whatever dude. I'm heading out. Later."" He left.


I decided if I couldn't get him to admit it, and some maximum strength ex-lax pills. I went through the pain-staking process of opening the dexedrine capsules, and putting the little beads into my new capsules. I ground up a bunch of ex-lax pills and filled the old dexedrine capsules with the ex-lax. I only made 7 *fake* dexedrine pills, as I was feeling lazy and it was hard to get the old capsules to stay put back together.


After putting the fake pills back in my original bottle, but I figured whoever was stealing them probably wasn't examining them very carefully anyway. Now it was time to wait.


A mere *three* days later, ex-lax filled pills are missing. A few hours later, I hear someone go in the bathroom. I immediately hear some of the most awful, disgusting noises I've ever heard in my life, along with some pretty intense breathing/groaning. I go and knock on the door, and say, ""You okay in there?""


""Ugh, sorry."" Lo and behold, it was Ron's voice coming from the bathroom. Victory was mine.


Ron has since moved out. After not paying rent for a month, on more than several occasions I heard Ron groaning in the bathroom. I can only assume that he didn't make the connection between the pills and his shits, and continued to take them. Moral of the story: don't steal shit from your roommates, and don't take pills that aren't yours. Not only is it potentially dangerous, but (in Ron's case), *it's just a shitty thing to do.*

Side note: The cops in this small campus town were mostly assholes, so I knew that the cops had to respond to complaints.

At this point, I would call the cops. She apparently didn’t believe me (or was too drunk to care), so she reared back and slapped me as hard as she could. 

I called 911 and reported the assault. Since officers regularly patrolled the campus bars, then cuffed and stuffed her. She quickly figured out that it no longer was a game, and started to cry.

Back in 2005 I had a full-time web development job and was also doing some freelance web design on the side. I managed a few of my clients' websites on a shared hosting account and would occasionally review the built-in analytics to see who was hitting my sites and what they were looking at. This was before the days of Google Analytics. 

One day, which was using an image hosted on my account as its background image (it was a Smurf, which he had tiled in the background, making the page pretty difficult to read). I was annoyed in the most petty sort of way - how dare he hotlink *my* image and use *my* bandwidth! 

I perused his profile and discovered that he and all of his friends were all born-again evangelical types who inserted pictures of Jesus into every other comment (of which there were dozens posted on a daily basis). Jesus was everywhere on this profile. It looked like a bunch of Jesus clones were partying with the Smurfs. 

Suddenly

I considered my options. Goatse immediately came to mind, and not particularly funny. I then realized that the image he was hotlinking was a gif - animation was in play! The possibilities were endless.

I opened the Smurf image in Adobe Fireworks and turned it into a repeating pattern so that it would look exactly the way that it did tiled in the browser. I then turned it into an animated gif that every twenty seconds flashed an image of [Linda Blair from The Exorcist](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/447/the-exorcist-73209.jpg), I miss you).

So assclown stands directly behind the lady customer, HE's not the one being rude, isn't this typical of D.C. and federal bureaucracy, has to stand in line for an hour to ask a question, blah blah blah. 

Now, I don't want Mr. Fucknuts messing with MY precious time. So I tell him, ""Sir, I believe there's another employee in the lobby who can help you -- that guy in the blue sweater,"" and hook my thumb at said fella. Dickhead looks at me, then turns and walks back to find the guy -- without acknowledging or thanking me, of course. I can hear him back there haranguing the poor worker as I wait. 

Now the customer at the counter is finishing and I'm getting my stuff ready and wallet out, saying that guy couldn't help, can you believe this place, just need to get a question answered, he's sure I won't mind if he just gets this thing taken care of, what IS it with these people? *These* people. 

OK

So as the lady at the counter moves off, and I say, ""I think the line's over there,"" and point. He steps up to the window anyway, and starts talking to the lady. She promptly tells him to get in line, puts her ""Closed"" sign up on that window, comes over to the window where *I'm* standing and starts helping me.

On the same month I lost my job due to too many absences (mother was terminally ill) then my mother passed away and at the time husband drains the bank account and leaves me (telling me over the phone on the day I returned from my mothers services in Baltimore) that he wants a divorce. 

He worked a low wage job and was college student when we met and he had very little. When he moved into my place

He rarely contributed to *any* household expenses so when he left

A few months later I get a letter from his attorney demanding I send an itemized list of all items we purchased *together* during our marriage. 
My blood boiled  at the site of this after what he had done to me and the kids. 

So the beautiful internet helped me. I went to sites that sold some crazy sex toys and devices and made a list of 300 items we had ""purchased"" together and sent the letter to his attorney and stated I could drop them off at his office whenever he was ready to receive. 

Never heard from his attorney on the matter again. 

Fast forward to after the divorce and ex is still a bitter asshat- I get a letter from his new attorney claiming some BS that I am not in compliance with the standing court order for visitation because I had moved and did not inform the courts of my new address thus a ""direct violation of the order by not advising the court 10 days after move"" 

It's not that I was hiding, he just wanted to be a dick.

The letter also stated that he was represented and that I am not to have direct contact with *his* client. 

Oh

The attorney charged $300.00 per hour and each call

So I came up with the dumbest questions and most ridiculous things to fax his attorney for:

This story took place just over 10 years ago.  I worked for a pretty upscale hotel night manager for a few years.  I had two other night auditors on my team, a lapse of judgment by me.

Fast forward a year later and I am finding that working nights is not working out for me anymore

FUCK THAT.  That night my drunk girlfriend pops into the hotel to visit and we let ourselves into the bitch GM’s office and have sex all over her desk, “fuck this shit, if you are quitting then so am I!”  He types his resignation as well giving his two weeks notice.  We want to be fair to the third night auditor so we call him up the next morning and explain what happened and he decides to give his notice as well.  The next night the three of us are scheduled and we celebrate by showing up a few hours late and quite intoxicated.  We make it through the shift and the three of us spent the remainder of our two weeks notice either calling in sick or taking lieu days.  Having the whole night audit team up and quit with no notice left the hotel fucked.  We heard stories of the operations manager working nights and even the GM having to pull night shifts because there was nobody else, never mind the lack of training and the fact that nobody else knew how the night procedures.  

The aftermath… the positions I applied for were both filled by hiring from the outside.  The girl who was hired for the DM position was fired within a couple weeks for sleeping with one or more or the bellmen.  The accounts payable person was fired about 6 weeks in for being useless.  I went on to find a great job for an extremely great company as an accountant and they are paying for me to become a CGA.  I still see the old bitchy GM around town and I make sure to give her a big smile and wave.

We were parking here for about a year or so and we got to know the other vehicles in the lot. We worked longer hours than most other people and were usually amongst the first to arrive and pretty much always the last to leave. There was one other woman on our same schedule so we ran into each other a lot.

Our city sucks for cold snaps. We were about a week into a cold snap that was staying constantly below -35C and felt like -45C with the wind chill. Pretty horrible conditions

One day I got to my car and realized my engine block heater stopped working. My car was frozen and needed a boost to get it going. The problem was we were in an area where there are few people around. The only two vehicles left in the lot was mine and this woman's. We had a rough idea that she should be around soon

I had my booster cables on my battery waiting. When she arrived I asked her if she could boost us. ""Nope"".

Normally I would chalk it up to it being a jerk

Her response: ""No

I was livid

The next morning the weather was equally bad so we decided to take my wife's car. It was less reliable but it had command start that worked great. So we just programmed it to start every 30 minutes just to keep the engine warm enough.

Once we arrived at the lot I noticed the woman's truck was already there. I went over and unplugged it just enough that there was no connection

When I got to the lot there were only the two vehicles again

We waited a minute and to our surprise she had the nerve to ask us for a boost. I told her that she should have plugged her truck in

That was the last time I seen her at that lot.

This involves a somewhat popular card-based trading game (MTG).  I tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read.  Plus

I usually am not the one to take revenge since I’m risk-averse.  However

There was this fellow in my high school.  His name was David.  He was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole

Often times during lunch hour

When he did, 3, even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1.  His opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what David was doing.  I just kept my mouth shut.  Pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had 4-5.  It was very ridiculous.

I usually avoided playing with him

It was 1995 at the time, which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the game’s history.  Therefore, I was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since I didn’t see how I could ever catch up.

A guy I knew, where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack.  This sounded like an interesting variation on the game, and I thought I might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game I was quickly losing interest in.

Incidentally, but he let David join anyway.  The logic being that he needed people, even if those people were assholes.  There was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that.

Can you guess whom my first match was against?    That’s right.  It was fuckface himself:  David.

Now

Knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities.  I felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game.  I needed to stack the deck in my favor

So

In order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards

My deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a Demonic Tutor.  It essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want.  If I ever got this card

David also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well.  I think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much.  I don’t remember what card it was

To prepare, if you put it in a deck, you can see it stand out from all the other cards.  You only see this if you know what to look for.  

When we met for our match, so I crossed my fingers.

Next we shuffled our cards.  Since I could see where my Demonic Tutor was, I have a second chance of getting the monster instead.

Luckily, so I was good to go in that department.  Next, I cut his deck, but since I could see where his Precious Rare was located, I made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match.  David was too self-absorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions.

Things are going well so far

We start to play.  My job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat.  And try he did.  He tried to do the whole multiple card-draw on me.  I called him out on it.  David tried to act like it was an accident.  This got the tournament organizer’s attention and David a verbal tongue lashing from Alex.

Alex basically told David to stop acting like an asshole and play the game.  This had the effect of crucially destroying David’s credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side.  I shined a spotlight on his douchey ways

Next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules.  Of course

Soon enough

The next round

The best David can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster.  Knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his Precious Rare safely at the bottom of his deck

Every subsequent round, during this time, nothing good came out of his deck.  Slowly, his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew.

Then it was over.  I celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style.  David was so mad he was shaking.  Whenever he spoke

While I was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune, he reduces the chance that I’ll randomly take any of his good cards, including his Precious Rare.

I immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together.  He starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them.  I make a big show of arguing and acting like I was cheated.  Honestly

I called over Alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution.    Clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device

Acting hurt and angry, how wrong he was.

While making a show of concentration and trepidation, “at random”, I pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the Precious Rare.

Immediately David let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent.   He quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room.  But I had his Precious Rare.

Everyone was overjoyed that I had completely and totally demolished David and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time.  We all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved.  Honestly it was the highlight of the tournament.

David dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go.

I never told anyone about my deception.  I think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against David to deliver justice.

tl;dr  I outcheated the cheater by knowing the future.

I was on a piece of playground equipment known as the 'Jetty' at my local primary (elementary) school in grade 2

Trent didn't seem to like the sound of that idea. Instead, but then he started pushing me. I made the fatal mistake of pushing him back just as a teacher walked around the corner - We're both dragged of to the principal's office. The whole walk there he keeps leaning over and whispering to me; 'Oh, you're in *so* much trouble now"".

The principal sits us both down and calmly asks us one at a time to tell our stories. He starts with me. I calmly tell him the abridged version: Trent wanted the playground to himself, called him names and swore at him (""I... I don't want to say what he said. It was the F-word but I don't want to say it because I know it's a bad word Mr. H, he was just so *mean!*). 

I sat there, but it's just no use. After all, I was the older kid in the situation - I should have known better, right?

The principal asks me to step outside his office to have a chat with him in person. He tells me how disappointed he is and how ashamed I should feel for hurting poor innocent Trent. I was given a punishment I wouldn't have (at the time) wished on my worst enemy - Garbage duty with Ms. Hanzel. 

Ms. Hanzel was a rotten old lady that seemed to absolutely despise students. She was about sixty years of age and physically looked like a female version of Jabba the Hutt with glasses (**EDIT**: Anodesu suggested [Roz from Monster's Inc](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110515131745/pixar/images/4/43/Roz.png). - Much better example!) . I could constantly hear her shouting at her pupils from outside the halls, Ms. Hanzel was an absolute witch, and I was going to spend the next few hours picking up rubbish in front of all my peers with her.

The principal walked me outside her office and made sure I knocked on the door before heading back to check on poor little Trent. I slicked inside, hands me a plastic bag and stares at me for a good thirty seconds. ""What did you do?"", she asked me. Frustrated and scared, I broke down crying. Between sobs I managed to tell her about how Trent lied to get me in trouble. She sat down, and I'll never forget the story she told me.

She explained that back when she was my age, another girl accidently knocked over the teacher's inkwell and blamed it on her. She got 10 hard spanks to the back of the hand (Demonstrating the first three with her ruler in mid air, one after another). She told me how much she despised this disgusting little girl, and how badly she was treated for the rest of her time there.

Then, okay?"". I couldn't believe it. I was standing right in front of the nastiest teacher in the whole school and here she was giving me the equivalent of a royal pardon.

To make an already long story short, but one I now associate with sweet, sweet revenge. I strode up to the Jetty and played on that damn thing all lunch while Ms. Hanzel made the little shit pick up all the rubbish down below me. I don't know what she got him for, but she made sure I could see the brat at all times, and more importantly, the little brat could see me playing on the playground he so desperately wanted to himself. I like to think that she helped me achieve the revenge she never got.

Being new to looking for roommates we overlooked a couple of things that we really shouldn't have. For example, but it took about a week until it was all collected.

Through the first month my wife noticed this girl was a complete slob. Her room was just a series of garbage bags packed with her lifes possessions and she never cleaned up after herself. 

The roommate came home one day with a cat. My wife didn't mind since she only has me stopping her from becoming the cat lady with 50+ cats. The problem was the roommate never fed the cat. She would leave for days on end with no one taking care of the cat. My wife always took on that responsibility. Good thing cats are pretty resilient.

Then, and she had only paid about a third of the rent by the time the next months rent came around. 

At this point my wife hadn't seen her roommate in weeks. We only knew she was there because she is a complete slob and left a massive mess in her wake. Finally my wife had a sick day and managed to see her roommate and asked for the rent money. The roommate said ""yeah I will go get it right now"". She never came back that night. 

We knew she was getting the boot at that point. The next day my wife went to class and came home to an empty apartment. Her roommate moved her stuff out and even took the kitten she never took care of. No forwarding address

We were out about $1000 in total. After about a week of searching we managed to get her parents number. After explaining the situation to them they gave us the phone number where she was staying - but not the address. Reverse look-ups weren't as easy back then (at least to me).

My wife called several times and received some pretty rude responses from her now former roommates boyfriend. At this point we were suing her for the money she owed us and needed to serve her the papers. So without the address this was pretty difficult. 

After a bunch of unsuccessful calls

I then told him

1361398459.0,18wvrd,Boyfriend's Petty Revenge ,sie_liebt,797,123,49,"I always pegged by boyfriend as a cool headed

As he explained, most guys go through a transitional ""asshole"" phase, like a rite-of-passage, when they realize girls are just people and not all that scary/special. He happened to be in that phase while he was in law school. 

He and a friend had gone to a local bar and, the night went well. They partied after the bar, had a blast, drank and partied until 6 or 7 AM, and passed out, although they didn't hook up (save your breath - he has no reason to lie about this as we share laughs about most of his ""exploits""). The next morning he and his friend drove home, feeling successful. 

They each wait the requisite three days before texting the girls

Weeks later they go to that same bar

When they return, he immediately approaches the girls and asks what was up, why they had dodged contact. The girl he had liked responds smarmily with, ""It is what it is."" He says that's fine, but could she get out of his seat because he and his friend were sitting there. She brushes him off again and replies, ""I said it is what it is,"" and turns to her ""date"" to ignore my boyfriend. 

That sent him over the edge. To allow guys to pay for all of your drinks, and then be a complete bitch when bumping in to them was unacceptable in his eyes. 

Attending a law school in the South, it was his obligation to inform the authorities. The cop asks what she looks like, and my boyfriend explains that she's a pretty blonde girl. The cop looked at him like he was crazy (as my boyfriend said, ""stared at me like what are you doing bro?"") and asked how he was going to know which girl it was. My boyfriend just told him he would give her a hug ""goodnight"". 

He walked back into the bar, ""Look. No hard feelings. Have a good night!""

He said the look in her eyes as she watched the police officer approach her from over his shoulder was priceless. She went to jail that night after being dragged out of the bar by a cop and having the contents of her purse dumped all over the street in public.

I'm looking at stuff and eventually strike up a conversation with the guys at the blacksmith booth

Now would be a good time to interject some relevant information. I am female, too.

My friends wandered off to watch the joust so it's just me and the blacksmiths and some neckbeard who showed up. I skip the joust because this is some good conversation and I am interested in metalwork. As the conversation continues Neckbeard starts interjecting. Apparently

He is not particularly polite. I start asking the blacksmiths about projects they have done. Every project the blacksmiths mention, you got injured doing something? He did something similar but got hurt worse. So on and so forth, in a rather smug manner. The blacksmith are not enjoying Neckbeards company.

During my time at uni, I saw the garden, all of it's plants and it's cold stone floor.

Being women in their 20's who were in college, disregarding the fact it was an all residential building, filled with families and other students that did not share their willingness to party at home.

They studied only in the late afternoon

Me and some other neighbors tried to solve the issue friendly, of course.

So I decided to prank them. It was small stuff at first. Very petty. One night, I peed on their car. I threw poison on their plants from my window. That petty, silly kind of thing.

The other neighbors were at it too. I heard (although I'm quite sure it is not true) that one of them went down the underground, and took all the paint out of one of their cars. I wish I had at least seen the car afterwards, but I never did. I'm sure we annoyed them, but not enough for anything to change.

This went on for a long, when you have to study for your tests, has a lot of personal problems and can't get enough sleep.

One glorious day, but it was ok. I got lucky and was able to trap the creature into a corner and kill it with a broom. Since it was so easy to get rid of him, I never told anyone about the rat.

It was a fairly big rat. About the size of both my closed fists side by side, I guess. But I had never even seen a rat this close before, so I thought it was interesting.

The thing is, since I loved the electrical impulse/muscle contraction experiment, but had never even touched a rat.

So I decided to keep it in my room (yeah

One night my loud neighbors started to party as usual. It was a wednesday. But that night, since it was night and it had coal burning bright and smoke climbing all the way up to meet me.

When I saw that, as it felt right over the rest of their cooking meat. The formaldehyde, flammable as it is, proppeled the fires beautifully, and the sound of what I believe was a small explosion followed the sound of the rat hitting the grill.

I did not see anything, sounds of beer bottles breaking... The party was over in a minute. They called the police right after.

I did not sleep that night. Nor the rest of the week. I was sure they knew it was me, they moved out a week later.

A mutual friend told me the reason: someone from the top apartments had thrown a rat filled with alchool on their grill. The police investigator that came that night somehow deduced it was from very high

Nobody got hurt, but they don't do partying at their home anymore. They are scared as fuck that they might have an even crazier neighbor than the last one.

I was the only witness to my own crime. They never saw me.

**The Situation**

I had some friends over one day; well, but we were not what I would call friends (we'll call him, well, we'll call him Thief). Anyway, I need to run to WalMart and they all agree to come with me, so we get in my truck and head that way. I get there and get all my supplies, then I mention that we should get lunch somewhere. My friends aren't the most financially stable people in the world, I'll pay for it. 


**The Shoplift**

As we're walking out the doors, Thief is munching on a bag of beef jerky. I ask him if he bought it and he informed that no he didn't buy it, he stole it, and then confidently laughs about it, like he just pulled off the crime of the decade.

Now it might just be a $3 bag of beef jerky from WalMart


**The Revenge**

We get to our spot for lunch, since I said I would pay for it. They all tell me, and when I get up to the cashier, I order everyone's order, except Thief's. He then had to sit there with his beef jerky watching us eat our delicious chicken sandwiches.

I see my next door neighbor talking in Russian with her family in her driveway, fully blocking my garage door, despite her driveway being extra wide (end unit). Now there are also four people out there standing around and loading something into the trunk.

I pull up and wait for them to see me and move out of the way, but I now also put on my left blinker to politely indicate that I intend to go into my garage... still nothing. They're slowing walking and loading stuff into the trunk of the car, and I'm fully in their view, but it's like they're making an effort to look elsewhere and not acknowledge me. I yell out the window, ""excuse me"", and they ignore it. I yell again, louder, and they turn their backs and ignore me again.

I get out and walk to my door, glaring at them, but they still wont even dare look at me. They continued to be parked in my driveway for another 15 minutes, and finally leave.

Tonight: It is now 10:45pm and I've been making a point to no longer limit my garage noise. It's still a bit ""early"" in the night, mildly slammed a few doors, etc.

As I sit at the light I happen to notice he's got his blinker on ('turning indicator' to some of you, and so do I.

There's no reason everyone else's day should be slowed down too much due to one dbag.

While doing this I see the guy behind me is super unhappy and yelling and flipping me off because he can't get around me because he pulled up so close to my car.  I would have just sat here for a second light change to make him even later to where ever he was going, and a t shirt screaming and yelling.

1372977075.0,1hnr5c,High school revenge on racist bullies,out-of-phase,769,127,34,"First


When I was a freshman at high school, I wasn't into video games, I didn't get very good grades -- my passion has always been music (and, at the time, skateboarding). I like to think I made friends indiscriminately. And I did; if I met you, and you were a nice human being, I never saw any reason to not become friends with you.


Because of this, band kids, jocks (the nice ones anyway), nerds, drama kids, etc. I never got into any fights or instigated conflict. I was always sort of the ""class clown"", and I got the nickname ""Swiss"" for usually being neutral on most things and always trying to make peace. The only time I was a loud mouth was when I was goofing around.


As y'all probably know, but when I did I tried to stand up for myself, and usually they'd resolve themselves. But there was one group that started giving me trouble my sophomore year, the senior jocks.


Not all of them, all of them dipped (mouth tobaccer), drank, had pickup trucks, lifted weights, cursed all the time -- the list goes on. But, when they first started picking on me


Basically, I guess they interpreted my humor as arrogance. So, instead of leaving me alone, they decided to single me out. Any time I saw any one of their group in the hall, it was *guaranteed* that I'd get called a faggot or douchebag, and likely that I'd get the old bully go-to ""shoulder bump"".

It got worse and worse as time went on, because often they'd follow my car when I left, honking, yelling, etc.

One day, and called me an ""inbred jap piece of shit"". 


I'm 25% Japanese, and his mother even more so. Instead of ignoring them, I turned around, looked directly at the dude who insulted me, and said, ""Your mom should've swallowed."" They took off running after me. I managed to get in my car and speed off towards home. I thought I'd lost them.

About 10 minutes later, leaning on the edge of the pickup, screaming all sorts of shit.

I kept slowing down until I was going probably about 20 mph

Then I brake-check them, leaning over the top of the cab; he fell forward over the windshield and hit the ground in the front. The other two had been sitting precariously on the sides of the bed. They both lost their balance and fell backward onto the road. I couldn't stop laughing.

I sped off, and started tailing me again. I drove to the local police station (happened to only be a minute or two from where we were -- small town), and they follow me into the parking lot, still yelling and hollering. They get out of the car and start walking towards me, and two police officers come out. 


They sit all of us on the sidewalk and ask what happened; I told the police they were following me throwing rocks at my car. The dudes denied it back and forth. One of the cops saw the rocks in the pickup bed, in exchange for taking away their cars. For the rest of their senior year, they had to ride the bus to school.

I went into a recently opened branch.  There were no customers in the lobby and three tellers were manning the windows.

I asked if they had a box of pennies in the vault I could purchase and the teller instantly said no.  Didn't look, so I let it slide.  I'd seen a few penny rolls on the counter at the next teller's window, so I said if she or the other tellers had any pennies on hand I'd buy a couple of dollar's worth.  Again, she said no they didn't have any at all at the moment and didn't bother to look or ask the other tellers.

About ten-ish years ago, I was seated between the two most obnoxious kids in my entire graduating class. I'll call them Justin and Corey.

They were *those* kids, Corey and Justin hated each other. They would constantly bicker and fight, sometimes trying to swat at each other and usually hitting me as well since I was the only thing separating them. It was hard to pay attention with this going on around me, and one of my favorite classes was quickly turning into a nightmare.

My math teacher was a good guy, you could form a line at his desk and he'd give each student one-on-one help. 

On this one fateful afternoon of class, saying mean things, taking my pen, etc. but back then I was too nice (read: doormat) of a girl to do anything in retaliation, and I didn't want to get in trouble for disrupting class. 

I had just about had it up to here, guess who also needs help on the in-class work...

There was another kid getting help in front of me

At that moment, with all of my 11 year old strength, I bitch slapped him as hard as I could and told him to go to hell, consequences be damned.

My teacher saw the entire thing. I was expecting him to drag me straight to the principal's office, ""Mr. [Teacher], vondahl just hit me! Make her get in trouble!!!"" 

The teacher, ""Well, Justin, you kind of deserved it. As you can see, your behavior towards others has consequences.""

It was a small store but got a lot of business because of the drive-through. So we would make coffee and occasionally small food items for customers and a good 99% of our customers were great

   Well one morning i was assigned to the task of making food for all the customers and taking drive-through orders. So everything was going great the first few hours of my shift. It was just another morning trying to start off our customer's days the right way. Then a woman pulls up to the box outside in her car and I answer ""Good morning welcome to space dollars."" I hear her talking on her phone and receive no reply. I'm thinking who could she possibly need to talk to at 8 in the morning. So i wait patiently listening to this woman talk about nothing important for a good 30 seconds. 

  Finally

  She orders a latte of some kind I can't recall because this story is not about that. My coworkers and I have by now decided that we collectively hate her. So when she orders an oatmeal that takes a minute alone to make I am fuming from my ears with hatred. She wants me to put splenda and steamed milk in her oatmeal which we make with water.

  She gets to the window and rudely holds out her money and doesn't look at us while she continues her conversation about nothing. She is driving an old beat up minivan which makes me realize her life may suck. Still having manners and being decent to other humans shouldn't be a problem so I made her oatmeal, and sent her off. 

Here comes the revenge. I know this woman. She comes in everyday and gets the same oatmeal and eats it on her drive to work. So I made it perfect with beautifully frothed milk and 6 splenda nice and boiling hot and put a plastic knife in the bag(instead of a spoon). She had to stare at her favorite morning breakfast and not eat it. Good luck lapping up your oats with a knife on the highway. It was probably cold before she at it. Ahhh sweet vengeance.

I still to this day picture her at a red light trying to get a couple of little morsels balanced on her knife only to drop them on herself when she brings it to her mouth.

I've seen it a lot, she took it a step further and began honking incessantly. 

Through the construction the road went from its normal 60km/h to 30km/h. I let off the gas until I got down to just above 30km/h. This woman didn't back off even a little. I tried barely touching my brakes so they would flash without actually braking in hopes that she would get the message and back off - she didn't. 

A little ways into the construction zone there was a large metal grate on the road. It was about 3-4 inches thick and did not have a lip to help ease onto it. I was in a little and low sports car so I had to slow down. As I approached this thing I had to brake regardless of how close this idiot was to me. As expected when I braked she had to lock up her tires to avoid rear ending me. The thing was

There were four of these grates in total and at each one I braked and she came within millimeters of hitting me. Each time the frequency of her honking increased. 

Once construction ended I moved back into the right lane. This woman passed me then swerved into my lane and slammed on her brakes. Seeing her previous stupidity

Late that evening I received a call from the police. Apparently someone reported me for dangerous and reckless driving. The police asked me to go down and give a statement

The next morning I woke up still pissed and decided to go back to the police station and get more information. I spoke to a different cop that explained the womans report claimed it all happened between such and such a street. Immediately I knew I could proof she was lying about the swerving from lane to lane to not let her pass part. There was construction through the entire area she mentioned and one lane was a giant open pit because of it. I explained this to the cop and he was slightly more receptive

I went to court about 6 weeks later to fight the ticket and step one is going to the counter to speak to a court clerk. This is the person that weeds out the people who either want to just pay their fine

As I was standing at the front of the line I was close enough to hear the people in each of the three windows talking to the court clerk. These two large women directly in front of me began yelling at the clerk and saying ""this is bullshit"" before storming out. I figured ""oh great

I was confused and a little worried. 

She then proceeds to tell me there is good news and bad news. The good news was the second cop I spoke to hand apparently been on patrol shortly after we spoke and was in the area this all went down. He confirmed my story and dismissed my tickets. The ""bad"" news - well one of those two large women who were angrily berating the court clerk was actually the one who filed the complaint. The police now believed my story and gave her the same fines I just had dismissed in addition to another fine which was in regards to filing a false police report. Total of which was slightly over $2000. The bad news part of that was that I needed to stick around and testify. I did so - happily.

We sat in the traffic court waiting area for about an hour. The entire time those women had absolutely no idea I was the guy who was going to testify against one of them. When the time came the crown prosecutor called us into court. She explained her story then I explained mine. Then to top it off the cop who issued her the tickets and dismissed mine made an appearance and explained his portion of the story. She was guilty on all counts and out a couple grand. The judge even gave her a lecture on lying to police and how she could have been sentenced to jail time for it and told her she got off lucky.

For most of the school year, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now

My junior year rolls around

From day one, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit

Eventually, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

Before I caught him cheating, I was always scared of him walking home drunk. He had already been hit by a car doing so before I met him, and wound up in a coma.

He refused, and said one night he was going out with the guys. I decided, that since he was going out, too. My friends and I went to our favorite diner to hang out, we ordered a lot of food over the course of the evening and not just coffee/soda

We got our normal booth, eating, when he went PALE. ""ahoythrowaway, you need to see this."" When I looked, my boyfriend was kissing our mutual good friend. And it wasn't an innocent peck, they might as well have been eating each other's faces.

As I walked out the store and take a few steps

I get to the car

Me (just to make sure): Are you following me to take my spot sir?

Him: Is there a fucking problem with that? Hurry up.

OH HELL NO.

I just keep walking, and actually get in the car (my card is there anyways). I stay there for a goor 5 minutes before getting out, walking toward the mall and waving at him with a big smile.

I got the manager of the business that I was in to print out my order form from Amazon. When the police arrived, they took the owner's story then came inside to talk to me. I showed him proof of purchase, as well as my ID and the card I used to order it. The officer took that and showed it to the owner of the other business and when the officer came back in he claimed that the owner would apologize.

So anyway, he's still really apologetic (though I knew he really just wanted that review down), but after hearing that he lost around $20k in profit over what is a $200 tool, I got the warm fuzzies inside and decided I'd done enough damage, and took the reviews down.

I felt like I made my point. I put a measurable dent in his business and I taught him a lesson. Even if his apology may not have been authentic, and then they go and do the same thing that I did, but decide to leave it up. Either way, I felt like I got my payback and I'm all for letting bygones be bygones. If he continues to be a dick, it'll come back to him, so I'm not really that worried about it. Myself and everybody I know have all pretty much agreed that he's a dick and would all rather take our business elsewhere because of it.

I don't feel like I'm censoring myself. I feel like I let him squirm long enough and now I'm letting up. Maybe I'm a more forgiving person than some of you in this instance but that's my choice.

Just a little relevant information;

When I was in elementary school I was a decent student. I wasn't the ""star pupil"" or anything close to it. I was always in the B+ to A range. Our school had a rewards program (very similar to Mrs. Puff's ""Good Noodle"" star program) where if you got good grades, so you never changed seats.

Into the story now;

I was seated next to a loud mouth boy, blatantly ridicule you and just make your life an all around hell. However as soon as he was confronted by a teacher he was the perfect angel, therefore he was never caught doing anything wrong. He also didn't give two shits about school, so he never even bothered to look at his marks, this ends up being in my favor.


About a month into the school year


Then one day I was called to the principal's office and I was scolded for copying SH's work! I was outraged


When I went back to my class and sat down


Being a shy kid, it would mean extra work but who cares if I got my revenge! I decided that every time I did my homework, I would make two copies. One of the copies would have my actual work, and the other would be complete bullshit. I would put the fake copy in my homework folder and simply move my real work to a different binder.


SH continued to take my homework from my knapsack


Skip forward to the end of the year when he received an envelope that had his parents name on it. This usually means that the principle wants to get a message to the parents directly. It also read ""OPEN ONLY WITH YOUR PARENTS"" in big red letters on the back. He, his face fell a little and began to tremble a bit. I overheard him whisper to his friend that he failed the grade and had to stay back a year!


The feelings that filled me were glorious. I felt terrible of course, he confronted me after the last bell. Our confrontation was short and sweet;


&gt;SH: HEY! CitySecrets what the fuck happened?!

&gt;Me: I don't know what you mean? (I knew exactly what he meant)

&gt;SH: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN (he shook the envelope grasped in his sweaty hand)

&gt;Me: Oh

&gt;SH: YEAH I KNOW

&gt;Me: Because i'm smarter than you.

&gt;SH: Fuck you! I'm gonna-

&gt;Me: (I cut him off) Gonna what? Gonna tell the teacher that you were stealing my work?

&gt;SH: Fuck off! (A man of many words)

&gt;Me: Have fun repeating this year.


Before he could say anything, but I also felt good because I stood up for myself to the biggest bully I have ever faced. I graduated before him and ever since I haven't seen him.

1355409964.0,14sbix,Roommate didn't pay gas bill and continually lied,Synthetika,675,87,74,"This happened to me about a year ago when I still thought roommates were good ideas. I was in need of a roommate after my boyfriend and I split so my friend decided to take on the spare room. Since the gas bill was the ex boyfriends I asked if she would transfer her already existing account to the house to which she agreed. So we decided that I would pay the electric and she the gas. Any difference between the bills would be split.


Well one month in and we receive the gas bill claiming there is a $300 balance so I ask her why she has such a high balance and she says its just the deposit and that she would have them waive it after she set up direct deposit and they would send us our ""normal"" bill next month.


Another month goes by and they come by and shut off our gas and stick a non-payment flyer on the door. Understand that this is the start of winter the temperatures are getting colder day by day at this point it was between 15-20 degrees (Fahrenheit) each night. Thankfully it wasn’t mid winter and we hadn’t gotten into the negatives yet. Still was cold and I worried about the pipes freezing.


I give her a call and let her know what happened. She puts on the whole fake sorry act and says she will call them right away and fix it. I once again believe that she’s going to take initiative but of course she doesn’t. 


I know that she is not doing anything about it and that she is just going out partying everyday. I had known from the beginning that she was not very responsible but didn’t think she would let it go on that long. I tried calling the gas company myself but they would not do anything since it was under her name and I did not know her SSN. I had resorted to taking showers at my friends’ houses


This goes on for three weeks that I am asking her constantly if she has gotten it fixed and all she continues to do is give me ridiculous excuses. Always blaming the problem on the gas company or the bank.


I decided enough was enough. One night while she was staying out at a friends house I went into her room. Just for a minute I stared at her electric heater thinking of how badly I just wanted to start kicking it but then decided that might be a bit much and she would know I did it. I grab some tools and start to take the thing apart. I clipped one of the wires inside and then put the whole thing back together set it back in the same spot and casually left the room snuggling into my bed with a smirk.


The next morning I hear her walk into her room and just seconds later a loud whine comes from her about how her heater won’t turn on. It’s easy for me to hear since her room was right next to mine. I get up and walk to her room and with a look of concern say “What’s going on? You ok?” she just replies with the same whine about how her heaters broken and her room is freezing. I shrug and say “Oh sorry that sucks I’m going to get ready for work.” And not but five minutes later I hear her on the phone with the gas company working on getting the gas turned back on. They make it out a week later and get everything turned back on. Yes the satisfaction really was that she had to freeze for a week. While I still had my heater in perfect working order.


TL;DR – Roommate doesn’t take care of gas bill. Heat gets turned off for a month. I get pissed and inconspicuously break her electric heater.

6 minutes in, there was this little window where the kitchen staff places the finished orders, ready for the wait-staff to take them to the customers' table. Her order is finally done and I took it to her.

To my surprise, assumed it was hers and took it behind my back. I immediately told her that it was another customer's order. I think she didn't realise that her kid was happily chomping down a chicken sub as she ""screamed"", slapped off the sub from the kid's hands, made him spit whatever he was chewing and started to pick out the bits of chicken on his tongue.

So after literally an hour of her telling me how something shows off too much skin, she settles with a pair of sunglasses. One pair. After an entire hour. I decided that I would get some revenge on her. 

She steps up to the register and throws her sunglasses on the counter. She then throws a 10 dollar bill next to them. I tell her that the sunglasses are usually $15. I look her strait in her eyes and say, said a quick, timid ""thanks"" and got out of there as fast as she could. I was so satisfied.

---
So, small town in california. Our house was a corner house, and because of that was one of the biggest lots in the neighborhood, and right on the edge of a seasonal river. Having so much space, I had dogs as a kid - normal, exciteable animals; Our dogs barked at strangers. Not excessive barking, but the usual ""Hey! Who are you? Why are you outside MY yard?"" 

Most of the neighbors had dogs, loud music from time to time. Neighbors made noise, we made noise, nobody complained. 

My first dog grew old and died, gave one to my girlfriend's dad; Cute little queensland/terrier mutts.) Anyways, the new dog had the same political views as the first one, and was pretty good at restricting barking to when strangers hung around. We had a good fence, and the dogs couldn't get out. Cool beans.

So, and move out to be closer to family. They rent their house out to first a series of teenagers and short timers, and eventually a middle aged couple. New neighbors are, at first, standard strange new people. We talked with them a few times, the wife described herself as an artist - she created gaudy yard sculptures, and made attempts at landscape design - she was way off base, and added a california ambience to her yard'. Cool. The plants ran rampant

After a while, and complaints to the police. Mind you, our dog barked about twice a day most days, though he really got excited when the trash truck came by - he loved to run back and forth across the yard yelling at it(one day he actually caught it - escaped out an open gate, tore ass down the street to catch it, and plowed right into the back when it stopped.)

We never did get a ticket, and decided it was time to take this further. Neighbor asked 'If I buy one of those electric collars, do you think it would work?' My mom responds 'I don't know, would you wear it?' 

Her screaming fits were met with first ironic responses

Then she bought the statue.

She must have found it at an estate sale, and proudly displayed it in her front yard.

Around this time, and the vet informed us the dog had ingested a very large quantity of rat poison(which we don't have or use). Of course we suspected the neighbor(She smirked at us from her yard when we got home), but couldn't prove anything, and the police couldn't do anything; No evidence, no witness, nothin.

So, stripped of the recent coats of paint, and lo and behold, the jockey was restored to its original racist black! Snuck back across the street and left the statue on the sidewalk, several house away from the neighbor. 

Come the next morning, a run-away note taped to its chest, escaping from its owner. Neighbor's husband isn't strong enough to move it back home, so gets on his bike and takes off before his wife wakes up. 'Somebody' called the police, complained about a racist art display, and they come to talk to the neighbor. Surprise surprise, they look in her back yard as they talk things over, talk to her some more

Turns out she had shot and killed an endangered owl,,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,True

**Background**:
I work in a coffee shop inside a family owned grocery store. I usually work the evening/night shift because I also attend school in the morning, I mean I'm walking out the door and punched out at 9. I have worked there for about a year and a half and I've never really had a problem with customers and I generally like helping people, always giving great service to people who deserve it. But sometimes, once in a blue moon, I'll get someone coming in right before closing who really gets under my skin.

**Situation**:
I'm rushing to close on time because my inconsiderate coworker didn't do anything she was supposed to do. It's around 8:50 and I'm mopping the floor, which could only be fake, and her mini-me of a daughter in tow. Both were dressed as if they were about to go clubbing. I was fuming at their lack of apologizes and behavior, never was treated so poorly (and I have been treated terribly, but thats another time). They stood at the counter, obviously wanting a drink. I put on my best customer service smile and forced myself to wait on them. Since it's a family owned business, quality service was mandatory and I'm expected to smile and bend over-backwards while juggling 3 whales on a unicycle atop Big Ben and swallow swords if the customer asked me to. 
I start out asking: ""What can I-"" when I was cut off. ""I need 2 large mocha shakes, right? ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything is in the dishwasher and soapy,"" I have a huge sincere smile on my face that I get to tell this bitch she's not getting her damn shakes. ""We close at 9 and it's 8:55."" She completely loses her mind yelling, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Are you saying that I can't get 2 drinks?! You close at 9, it's not 9."" My smile faulters as I see my manager charging over. ""Can I help you, SHE, I can't really argue with him so I just frown and say ""Fine, dimes

**The Revenge**:
I grabbed the blender out of the dishwasher and kinda washed off the soap. I poured the ice in and added significantly less chocolate, they would have to use a spoon. Then, I used coffee instead of espresso, same flavor just not good quality. I blend it for half the time leaving huge ice chunks in the bottom which is unpleasant to get around and is useless. When I poured it into their cups I ""forgot"" to add the chocolate around the outside, this doesn't change flavor, it's just not as cosmetically pleasing. And finally, I ""ran out of"" whipped cream so I used flat lids instead of the nice dome lids that hold the whip cream. I felt satisfied in my work and I decided to take an extra minute to clean up my mess, meaning I no longer work or do anything or else I get into trouble.

About 5 years ago the company I was working for was called by a realtor we had dealt with in the past to winterize a home she had listed because the owner had already moved into their new home.  

Now I have to explain something to everyone that reads this, almost always want a discount because they ""bring you a lot of work"" (which is bullshit); this particular realtor was the worst of the worst, she also happened to be a major bitch.  

I was sent to the job and arrived with everything I needed exactly when my dispatcher said I would

Once I got inside I started my work which was pretty easy;when you winterize a home you shut off and drain the water from the water lines, realtors and banks usually do it to protect a property that isn't occupied.  

I was just about done and I noticed that the main water valve into the home had a very slight drip, until I mentioned it to the realtor.  

Upon hearing that the main valve had a slight drip the realtor just flipped out

When I was done I wrote up an invoice and presented it to the realtor

After a curt yet polite exchange with my two newest enemies I decided to let the office handle them.  


About 2 weeks later we had a really bad cold spell and we received a lot of calls for frozen/burst water lines

I ended up working down the street from the house I winterized a few months later

Edit: TL:DR- I am a plumber that was sent to winterize an empty home, I was told to just put things the way they were before and I do, I overheard the customers saying they wouldn't pay me so I shut off the pilot light on the furnace, 2-3 weeks later the plumbing in the home burst and flooded the home, good times had by all.",,False,t5_2vg7t,True

And just as expected, she charged us for most of our deposit based on all the damages she left. What a scumbag. So I plan a three pronged approach: small claims + City Housing Dept + IRS. All of which worked beautifully. Small claims was funny, she showed up with her ancient mom as her....lawyer? (who actually fell asleep the whole case lol). She didn't prepare at all and was unfamiliar with the whole process. We stated our case and showed our media evidence to the judge. Landlord-scum tried to interject and say it was all made up.

This happened about four years ago. Being busy *and* broke is not a good combo, so I decided to go straight to the store after one my of classes (photography, this is kinda relevant), get the pants, and get back to campus in time for the next class. So I ended up downtown in clothes that are obviously worn, but still pretty neat, considering they've gotten sprayed with developer and fixer on a number of occasions (left cuff of my shirt had the only obvious stain, but they weren't noticeable. I also smelled of fixer.

Anyway, and look through the sizes. Didn't even need to try them on, I knew exactly which one I needed. As I lifted another folded pair carefully to look at the sizes on the tags, a hand slams down on the pile, ripping the corner of the one I was lifting out from between my fingers. I looked over my shoulder and saw the biggest, snottiest sneer I've ever seen on someone's face. When this sales-- well, I don't think ""lady"" really applies, bitch will have to do -- this salesbitch saw that she had my (rather stupefied) attention

Of course, then met her eyes again, and said, ""Of course I know they're $300, *sweetie*. If I didn't have that money, I'd be doing the selling, not the buying."" I lost count of the number of colors and shades that flashed all over her face.

As a bonus, and said, ""Oh, no. I'm *so sorry*. I'd help you pick it up, but I have to run back campus. Sorry again!""

Revenge achieved. I also did talk to the manager about her behavior, but that was an *accident*), but there has to be some level of decorum, especially since I had not interacted with anyone in the store. The manager was pretty understanding, and even commented that she had received complaints about similar behavior with other costumers. I was kind of glad to know it wasn't just me. 

On the other side of the coin

And I still have those pants.

Edit: Accidentally a typo.

Edit Again: A lot of people are going on about how I can be ""broke"" and spend $300 on a single article of clothing. The 300 bucks were from my aunt with instructions to get those pants as a birthday gift. If I could do what I wanted with that money I'd either squirrel it away or buy cheap but neat clothing.

Besides, and they're in better state than other, newer pants. Plus the way they fit is awesome and they make my butt look great.

About 5 years ago, wouldn't say boo to a goose and very innocent and shy. Because of this, I didn't have many friends.

I soon got a job at a local restaurant as a waitress which was very upfront with their customers

The only thing bringing me down...was my boss.

He was an utter shit head but he seemed to have something in it for me in particular. He would rota me down for the deep clean shifts every week (out of around 35 staffs) Mon, dishwashers, ovens, bathroom sinks, customer toilets and on top of that, a 12pm-10pm shift. Bearing in mind I still had college to study for.

He would berate me, make me go get his coffee, ask me to make his food and always made fun of my appearance and financial situation. He knew I was desperate for money and I think he did all these things thinking I would never hand in my notice...and the fact I was an utter mouse and would never speak up.

Over time, staff trainer, shift co ordinator and eventually a supervisor. Of course, this also meant I would be working closer to my boss, who became even more unpleasant.

I graduated from college with the highest honors and received an offer from a hospital about 200 miles away (I was training to be a nurse) so the time came to hand in my notice. It was very emotional

So I bid everyone farewell

My best friend had risen to the rank of 1st assistant manager and invites me back for a party that is paid for by the restaurant chain in the most glamourous nightclub in town (free drinks and entry, he will have me escorted out by the POLICE!??! 

I'm pretty upset as I've come all this way to see everyone to be told I'm not welcome. My friends all leave the club and meet me in the bar next door so we proceed to have a great time.

As luck would have it, I don't drive a car, I already have a cute little bungalow in the suburbs that I bought and decorated myself, I have no hobbies, I don't like flying. I am dedicated to my life as a nurse and have kept my fortunes very quiet. For now, I'm investing and donating to charities. (oh, and I sent my parents on a honeymoon 35 years after they got married haha). I bought my best friend (the manager) a new car

Although, would I like lunch on the house for old times sake? Uhh, no thanks...what the hell is going on?!

I'm starting to get very uncomfortable. He puts his arm around me and asks me to join him in the office to check out the new CCTV system... well okay...I suppose.

The office has changed. On the wall are the sales figures, with a new fridge freezer highlighted.... on the computer, an email from Head Office saying that they have not been granted the budget for a new fridge freezer, only the document has been zoomed in so it's readable from 2ft away.

Boss sits me down. ""It's really nice to see you back in town, she didn't"" I reply. It's all pieced together in my head. I know whats coming...

""Well, since you were such a valued member of the team to us all here, If you wouldn't mind buying us a new one? It would be a great help you know"".

I don't believe what's just been asked of me

I smile. ""I have a better idea"". I go into my bag

""How about you go FUCK YOURSELF?"".

I promptly walk out

**TLDR: Restaurant Boss treats me like the shit of the earth for 3 years but I'm too shy to retaliate

Now to try to explain this next part.  The shower system in the locker room was a bit weird.  Every time somebody flushed a toilet in the locker room, or to when you felt that the locker room was empty, as to avoid getting doses of extremely hot water.  People were generally cool about this fact, and it wasn't really a big deal.

One afternoon while getting my campers into the pool area, “you should get your campers under control.  This is a university, not a zoo.”  Either  Professor Douche didn't realize these campers were special needs and needed closer attention, or he was just a real big douche.

So I'm driving down this road in the right hand lane, this jackoff in a raised pickup truck with all the fixins (you know the type) comes flying up behind me, gets right on my tailgate, and starts laying on the horn.

He swerves into the lane the second his truck is clear of the last little bit of curb. He punches the gas, and quickly starts to overtake me. With perfect timing, the car ahead of me moves over into this lane as well, blocking this truck's path. Cue the horn. The other driver proceeds to give 0 fucks about this guy on his ass riding the horn. Now, by this time, and I'm holding pace with the truck, at which point I give him a cheery little wave as he pops a few blood vessels.

I live in Mumbai. There is nothing like driving etiquette here. Driving is a game of survival

The bus service over here is also chaotic. I don't know what the ""international standards"" are, so don't worry, we don't have to climb in from the windows). And buses rarely halt for more than 20 seconds at a bus stop. In fact, they start moving before the last person has even entered the bus. (You buy the tickets after you're seated)

****

**REVENGE**

So it's frequent here that bikers try to save time by squeezing in between the bus stop and a bus. Nobody really cares if you get out from the front or back, when I see a biker trying to squeeze between the bus and stop, I'll stand at the back door, and put my hand out, signalling that I'm getting off. So the biker usually stays right behind me, so as soon as I get off and move away, he can cut out before the other person exits. But I don't move. I stand right outside the door (move a little back so that the other people can get on/off) till the bus goes away (usually within 10 seconds). ONCE the bus is gone then the biker can ride around me and continue. This maybe holds them back by a few seconds,,1366661441.0,t3_1cvahy

I whipped up his drink, he complimented its deliciousness, and proceeded to guzzle it fairly quickly over the course of around 20 minutes. He ordered another, standard procedure. I figured what the hell, his date's on the way, nothing wrong with a bit of liquid courage. 

So I mix up his second drink and my back is turned while I'm watching the blender. As the noise dies down, and this dude wants to close out his tab and get a table. My douchebag sensor starts tingling as I hand him the little tray thing with his card and receipt to sign. I make myself busy at the other end of the bar and bid him a good rest of his evening, as he and his lady grab a table. I go to pick up the tray and receipt when lo and behold, fucker stiffed me AND left a pile of his fucking fingernail clippings in the tray. Come on man- you just spent $18 on 2 drinks, and the only tip I got was a handful of your disgusting, gangly nails?? Fuck that. 

I watched the bar ticker closely as the waitress from his section put in the order I recognized: premium margarita, then blended it up nicely. Then I watched menacingly from a distance as he chugged down his frosty/naily beverage, knowing that was all the tip I needed.

This petty revenge wasn't the result of a single action


I remember being a child going to grade school and high school. Sometimes you just really did not want to go. So yes, was less motivated in school than I was and throughout his time at school would try to pull it a few times PER MONTH. Of course, by the time early afternoon comes around, he's playing video games and watching movies while eating ice cream. Now, bless my parents, but after a while they just kind of let my brother get away with it all the time. It was frustrating to me, because I put a lot of effort into school, but they would just say ""I don't have the energy to deal with him today."" It got to the point where it was laughable; I didn't think someone could have that many fevers


Anyways, the more incensed by it I became. The main frustration for me was that my brother was completely taking advantage of my parents, and my parents were LETTING him take advantage of them. I would see their looks of exasperation often during these ""sick"" mornings, and it would irk me to no end.


By the time the petty revenge (justice?) gets into play, and being that I was the oldest child still living at my parent's house, I was put in charge of getting my younger brother to school and watching over him. I was his ""legal guardian"" for the three weeks my parents were away. And as his legal guardian, I was going to make sure that he went to school every single day unless one of his limbs were cut off.


So it's early September, everything is fine. Until...


The SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL, I'm so sick. I have such a bad cold *fakeasshitcough* I need to stay home"". Are you kidding me? The second day of school, you are going to pull that shit with me? I was enraged, but this was also my chance to finally be able to directly address this issue as I couldn't address it before. My rage was building up for 7 years for this moment. Never did I realize that it would work out so perfectly.


I calmly let him know that he was, whether he was sick or not. He IMMEDIATELY became indignant, arguing with me about his body's failings and the recuperative measures that needed to take place. After about 15 minutes of debates, I gave him an ultimatum: either go to school, or we're going to the hospital.


""Fine


My nostrils flared with excitement. I had nothing to do that morning. ""Get your coat.""


With glee, the entire time with him bitching to me about how unnecessary this was and how he just needed to rest. I said that since he was sick quite often, we needed a doctor to check him out as I was worried about his overall health. Fuming, he waited with me in the waiting room for about an hour and a half before being called into triage, where he gave a laughable account of his state of health. The nurse looked at me with a smirk, as though she knew what I was up to, and I was reveling in the moment.


After another 30 minutes of waiting, pressing down on pressure points on his body. By the end of the assessment, the nurse is pretty confused as he's found nothing wrong with my brother yet (""How surprising!"" I thought), so he goes to get the doctor. When the doctor comes, he's as well perplexed by the lack of noticeable signs of concern. Since there's nothing noticeable that the doctor can see, he decides that everything is necessary. He orders a blood test, a urine sample


My brother hates needles. He turned white when the doctor said that. I was over the moon.


The nurse returns with the syringe for the blood test, so I was giving him small encouraging remarks that would get him through this. My brother is not impressed, and I can see in his eyes and his body language that he's regretting the decision he made to go to the hospital and to pretend to be sick that day.


Next, my brother says that he doesn't need to pee, so he won't be able to do the urine test. He thinks he won that round. The nurse looks at him and says, ""Well okay, but if you don't pee into this cup, I'm going to have to insert a catheter into your urethra."" It took me every fibre in my being to not burst out laughing at my brother's expense at that little quip. I am pretty sure I was visibly shaking with internal laughter. My brother's face dropped faster than a boulder rolling down a hill, and he grumpily asked where ""the damn bathroom was.""


When he returns, so I just chill out with my book and read while he takes the 45 minute journey to the underbelly of the hospital. When he returns, we wait another 30 or so minutes with his impatient (still pretending to be sick) moaning at all times, until the doctor comes up to us and basically says that my brother is fine and he's not sure why he's there. Smiling, I thank him for his time, exclaim how happy I was that my brother was not in any mortal, and lead my brother out of the hospital. We've been there for roughly 4 hours, I'm going to take a nice bath and then a good nap when we get home."" This boy thought he was in the clear.


""Oh, and going to school for your final two periods.""


He was LIVID. Swore up a storm, ""They may not approve, but they aren't home for another 3 weeks. I am."" After that, he sullenly sank into his seat and didn't talk unless it was to insult me.


We went home, I went into the attendance office to let them know that he was in the hospital all morning and that if he got a detention because of it they would be hearing from me. Told him I love him, he discretely shot me the finger, and I went home.


One of the most satisfying mornings of my life.

And then the mice problem started. They ate through a collector's item backpack that I had and tore some of labels from vintage wines that we had. They got into our cabinets and it was just hell!

She goes over to try to stop this, and the cops, who also like John (for the most part), tell her the deal. 

Her husband will have to spend a night at least in the county jail for his actions, as her name is nowhere on the ownership papers either. Only John can do that, as only his name is listed as owner, and he can only evict in person, which is not feasible until he gets leave. However, the cops give her a clever alternative method of payback. 

The next day, she can ask the hairstylist for entry. This is all technically legal, as she is allowed to modify the house, but can't evict. She isn't, however, denying her entry by allowing her in by asking, so HP has no legal recourse for entry.

After getting everything sorted, and apparently, she just ended her shift. Now, when she gives me her money, I notice that it's a little wrinkled and stinky. I put it aside in my drawer to get rid of later.

Her: ""Your sign says that you guys open at 7! I was here at exactly 7! Why weren't you open? I want to speak to a manager!""

Her: ""Why didn't anyone call me to let me know that you were closed?""

Manager: ""Ma'am

Her: ""I need to make a withdrawal!""

Her: ""Fuck you! I'm not signing shit for you. Other Manager at Other Location just hands me my money.""

The manager and I share a look at her blatant lie. The woman puts her debit card into the carrier and sends it to me. Then she pushes the call button.

Her: ""1234.""

Manager: ""Pardon? I don't understand.""

Her: ""That's my PIN. I want $200 out of my account. I want all small bills.""

I had to step out of sight to literally facepalm. The manage explains that she cannot use her PIN, the woman finally signs the withdrawal slip and sends up her driver license. It's expired. I would have told her that we couldn't accept it, but my manager was so frazzled that she did overrode the notice and told me to get the woman out ASAP.

ETA1: For those who asked about the coffee pot guy:

There is an elderly gentleman (though I use that term loosely) who comes in every single day - and I think he loiters on Sundays

We have this really cool coffee pot that plugs into a base. When it's plugged in, as well as cookies and candies. So, he comes in one day, and makes himself a cup of coffee. He normally goes through six or seven cups while he's in the branch, so we don't think it's odd at all.

He takes the entire coffee pot into my managers office with an entire container of creamer. He sits there for an hour, not even if someone's being an ass. So my manager just continues to talk to him. Finally, after an hour or so, the guy gets up to leave. He walks right by the coffee table thing without stopping.

He has the coffee pot and creamer tucked up snugly into his coat

Manager: ""Uhm

Man: ""What pot?""

Manager: *points at coffee pot*

I decided that I wanted to be a delivery driver because I loved my car and driving. I found a job in our local paper and called them immediately. They asked if I could start in the morning. Sure thing I thought and went up there at 7am ready to work. 

The company sold home soda dispensers and the CO2 and syrup cartridges that it used. My job was simple

I had a few minute conversation with the owner and he handed me a stack of 30 orders and had someone help me load my car. I was at the first place by 8am and basically zig-zaged all over town till about 6pm that night. Pretty easy job.

After my day or work I went back to the shop to give the owner the cash I collected - about $700. He hands me $30 for gas and says come back in the morning. That $30 was a little less than a full tank (back then at least). 

The next morning I arrived and get another 30 orders, but asked again just to make sure. He said I made 10 deliveries at $3 each and he paid me $30. I explained what he told me the previous morning and he denied having ever said that. Fuck that I thought. Then he was called out to their warehouse while I waited in his office. 

While I was waiting I realized something very very important. Through every talk we've had I only told him my first name. He never got any information from me whatsoever. In other words there was no record of me at their company.

I walked out to my car

I made the first few deliveries and collected payment. It was enough to cover my previous and current days of work and a little extra. I then continued making the deliveries but told every customer I visited that the company was going out of business and that the company was giving them their last order for free as an apology. Everyone was so nice and felt bad that I was losing my job that they tipped me quite well from the money they were expecting to spend on their order. 

I never went back to the shop. They never called me for their money because they didn't know who I was. A few months later they did shut down and I had a much better summer job.

These guys look around for the terribly embarrassed mother who is sure to be straight behind him to apologise profusely and yank him back to their table.... yet nasty chav momma hasn't even looked up.

Brat then runs behind the counter to the cooking area, a chip fryer and a bain marie back there and all at a lovely head height for a 4 year old. He pushes staff members out the way to go into the kitchen where we have the ovens and raw meat being prepared, he starts pressing buttons on the oven, dishwasher, glasswash... putting his dirty hands on our lovely clean work tops.

He then runs back into the cooking area where staff have now actually noticed him and are trying to block him away from dangerous areas. He;s trying to push past them

I've had enough, snatches him up and turns back to her trough. 'Whatever', I think to myself. I know there's nothing I can say to the mother about her son's behaviour.

The song plays. I hear him slowly wake up and realize he is being watched by a large mickey mouse head in the dark with a flashlight shining below it with the extremely creepy music playing behind it


He IMMEDIATELY darts for the door (which i left open) for him to run into the kitched (also dark) for him to see a dark figure stand about 15 feet in front of him (me) wearing a scythe (plastic one i had from 5 halloweens ago). He then freaks the fuck out and sprints for the guest room down the hall and locks himself in the room while crying his eyes out




He was very pissed but it was well worth it.

We thought why not pose as a particularly slutty girl (who shared an extremely similar first name) on a bunch of these online chat lobbies and put up his number soliciting phone sex and sexting.

1360536144.0,189r6y,Get off my account,monkey_wrench,579,86,73,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me the day before my birthday (about 3 months ago)

I thought because she broke up with me, so I figured we could keep the phone plan as long as we each paid our share. The initial break up was not bad, so it was feasible, however because she is an alcoholic, and started abusing drugs after we broke up, she began acting like I was ruining her life (that’s a story for another time). 

When she started acting like a bitch, and they said that all she needed to do was assume liability for her line, no fee for splitting the account. Awesome. I get a hold of my ex, and let her know this information. I call Verizon back after texting my ex, and they say that they can call her and start the process immediately. Perfect, do it.

I call Verizon the next day, all she had to do was call back and it would be over with. She would be off my account and have her own. I was very happy about this because I really wanted to lower the data on my plan, for one month I use a little bit less than 1gig and she eats up about 4.5-5gig. So the sooner she assumes liability for her line, the better. 

I wait a few days before calling Verizon back, and ask her what the hold up is, she says that she DID call back, they were supposed to contact her, and they never did, but that she got a text saying that it was taken care of. Ok, fine. 

I call Verizon back later that day and they said yes, it was lowered to $125.

From that day on, politely asking her to call Verizon so we can get this done and over with. She tells me each time that she plans on doing it later that day.

This goes on for about 3 weeks, because that usually makes the process go faster; scare her into paying and ending this whole ordeal. I decline; I want to give her a chance to pay the deposit without having to do something like that.

I text my ex, she basically told me that if I want her off my account then I can pay the deposit for her; she has no intention on paying the $125. 

I fume for a day or two and try to think of a plan. 

I call Verizon

What happens is this: I suspend her phone without billing, once the assumption of liability process starts, you only have 30 days to complete it. After that 30 days, the process starts over, and not only does the deposit go back up to $400, it's harder to lower it the second time around. 

I hang up with Verizon, AND since the phone number is attached to her brand new iPhone, its not like she can use it anywhere else.

She texts me furiously (using the wifi at the bar she spends all her time at because she doesn't have internet at her house)

I still hate texas to this day

I was in Houston on an assignment for a large IT vendor.  I took temporary residence and tried to blend in

But as a temporary resident

At the same time every morning, you had to memorize their location if you didn't want to wreck your car.

One day a particularly charming degenerate native observed my out-of-state plates and took it as his duty to tailgate me in his nasty pickup truck

The first day it happened I figured it was a random asshole

I revved it and let him follow close behind.  When buckle #1 came up

He was raging after that and tailgated closer

I thought I'd lost him after that but soon looked into the mirror to see him speeding up right behind.  He had a gunrack in the back and I figured he was unbalanced enough to try to squeeze off a shot.  I sped up again

His truck hit that and immediately slowed down.  

I never saw this asshole again.

It all starts in my urban apartment complex in some random U.S. town.  Our doors are situated in a way that makes us share an outer perimeter door with 5 other apartments.  The six of us share a common area complete with mall boxes and such.   One day a new group of men move into one of the vacant spaces in my section and it was soon afterward we started having issues.  I won’t go into full detail to explain all the bullshit these over privileged scumbags made me endure.  That would be me just trying to justify what comes later in the story.  

Coming home from work one day I notice a full set of keys hanging from the deadbolt to our common area.   This door acts as the first line of defense between the local beggars and hooligans.  To know any of the lowlifes that walk the street had access to my shared common area was enough to make me upset. What sort of mad man would just leave keys in the door like this?  I remove the keys and inspect them.  Car keys, mail box key.  The mail box key had the apartment number stamped on them so my first guess as to whom it belonged to was right.  I take the keys to them and get the door rudely slammed in my face as they laugh to each other about the situation.  They didn't even say a word to me.

...and now we arrive at James, very capable and rather smart, but very lazy which is why he wasn't near the top of our class. Anyway, James sat directly to my right and was getting B's on all of our quizzes until one day when he realized I was getting A's on all of them...this didn't sit well with him.

It only took one test for me to catch on that he was copying my answers because he bragged about how he scored the same as I did and I noticed that every answer was the same...I was a stupid

On Friday, C instead of D...etc) and then put down my answer for the bonus and got up...James sprints ahead of me and practically dives to turn in his paper. My heart leapt with joy and I just sit back to my desk to change all my answers back.

James scoffed at me and pointed out that I was stupid for forgetting my name or something on his way back to his desk. On Monday we get our scores back and he's shocked...0% but he got the bonus question correct. His jaw dropped even more when he saw that I got 100%. I then rubbed salt in the wound with a ""Huh

At this point James should've called it quits and just went back to his B's but he was almost as stubborn as I was...he was smart enough to figure out how I altered my answers but not smart enough to realize that he was outmatched...and so came Friday

This time I started off for the first 4 questions with the same pattern and then answered them all correctly for the last 16. I wait for James to get it and start furiously erasing all my answers and adjusting the first 4

...this went on for 3 more weeks until he finally caved. The 5th week I was especially devilish and wrote all my characters as they would appear on a calculator (boxy)...then I let James see them outright

His parents ended up getting a call as the teacher was concerned that something might be wrong at home...he was forced to explain this to his parents

TL;DR
Tricked a kid into writing down the wrong answers to a test after I figured out he was cheating off me. Then played off his ego/stubbornness resulting in 4 failed tests. Received icecream/praise from my dad when he found out.


EDIT: a few people have asked me why my mom scolded me...the short answer is that she felt the proper action would have been to just covered up my answers instead of being a devilish fiend. The long answer involves her taking christian values into skewed directions...she's lightened up an extreme amount since then.

Immediately the father denies skipping in line. The registries employee asks if that is true to the rest of us standing in line. We all agree with the redneck looking guys version of events. The woman tells the family to go to the back of the line.

The guy demanded that they be taken care of before he calls the police for hate crimes on the redneck looking guy and the employee. 

The manager says she will take care of them personally and asks them to have a seat so she can go grab the forms they'll need. They sit down and the line continues moving. The family looks at everyone in line like they just won. The people in line don't give a shit.

Waaay back in the day i delivered for this place that stayed open till 4am. Working till 4am can be tiring but drunk tips are some of the best tips

The place i worked at had a deal on Mondays for a large 1 topping pizza with a large drink. It came to $7.16 out the door. We would make bank on Mondays

Well one Monday i couldn't avoid this order. This was from a regular that lived on the very farthest edge of our delivery area in a seedy part of town and never ever tipped. Ever. Not even the change. He'd ask for all his money back down to the penny every time. And the dude had money, the orders would have come and gone,so not only am i going to not be tipped, I'm going to lose out on a lot more money just making this order. This greatly upset me. All the drivers were sick of this clown and his penny pinching ways! So i decided to get some revenge.
Did i mention its late fall

So i drop off my other 2 orders and Mr.Regular is last of course. I take his pie and wedge it up under the passenger side windshield wiper and start my trip to his house in the ass end of nowhere. I pull it about a mile from his house and its ice cold. Now there's no way he's going to accept this super icy ice cold box. Being the quick thinker that i am i put the pie on passenger side floor and blast the floor heat. It should be noted that the heater in a 87 Honda Civic should have a setting called blast furnace. I get to his house, he demands his exact change. I look him in the eye and say, ""Thanks man. Much appreciated."". On the surface I'm thanking him for the business but we both understood i was thanking him for nothing.

Well by the time i get back to the shop, whats up with this guy? Says his pizza is cold."" I told the owner, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. He lives on the edge of our delivery area and he never tips. Not ever. And he didn't tip when i went out there, so he should be happy he's getting a $7 pizza."" Another driver piped up and backed me up saying he hated delivering to that guy and never got tipped ever. The owner, bless that man, chewed out Mr. Cold Pizza! ""YOU NEVER TIP MY DRIVERS AND YOU COMPLAIN?!?! YOUR LUCKY WE STILL DELIVER TO YOU! IF YOU ORDER AGAIN AND I HEAR YOU DIDN'T TIP YOUR BLACKLISTED!!!"" and with that he hung up on him.

I worked for a few years as a sales associate at a clothing/skateboarding store. One day three young girls (maybe 12 years old) came running and yelling into the warehouse sized store

Less than a minute later another girl came in the store and asked if we had seen some girls come in. At first we thought they were just playing hide and seek or something but it became clear that these three girls were bullying their ""friend"" and were hiding from her for that reason. This poor girl was not dressed as nicely as the others nor was she as skinny.

She was also the only one who wasn't white.
My south-asian co-worker got really upset after seeing this all go down and turned to me and said ""watch this"".

While the girl was looking around for her friends it took everything I had not to just tell her where they were
He disappeared into the back room and came out with our manager following him. He then pointed at where one of the girls was hiding
SIDE NOTE: This girl had decided to hide directly infront of an air conditioner vent that constantly became stuck in place
My co-worker told my manager (and 5""11

I watched as my manager ignored the clothes in front of the vent and threw his fist into the wall as hard as he could. He wasn't expecting the clothes to start screaming. Nor did he expect a little girl with a very bloody nose to step out from behind the wall of shirts.

My co-worker watched smugly as my manager offered apology upon apology to the girl

When my manager turned furiously to me and my co-worker we both played as innocently as we could and somehow managed to convince him that we had no idea there was anybody behind the shirts.

As it gets closer to the starting time, cuts in front of me with her friend and blocks half my view. I was annoyed, but it was no big deal. I could still see the stage relatively well. 

After a few minutes, I tapped her shoulder and asked if she could move just a little so that I could still see (I made sure to note that her view of the stage would still be obstructed even if she did move). The interaction went something like this:



&gt;Me: Excuse me
&gt;
&gt;EB: No! I don’t fucking care!
&gt;
&gt;Me: If you move just a little
&gt;
&gt;EB: Fuck no



By this time, B-rude and C-inconsiderate, I wouldn’t have it. 

Eventually, because she started leaning into me and putting all of her weight onto me to try to get me to fall. I stumbled, and responded with an elbow to her stomach (Sorry guys, I’ve always had trouble with responding to bad behavior with good ones).Of course, this turned into her playing victim to the crowd around her, but I just ignored her and turned around to watch the show (and she didn't dare try the same thing again).

* * * * *

I live in a very small town in leftern Mass where the ""downtown"" consists of about 4 buildings.  Amongst other necessities such as the liquor store, with a small entrance/exit on either end for people to come &amp; go.  It's difficult to explain the layout but there's a few car-lengths of space on either side of the pump area (between the pumps &amp; the entrances/exits) for waiting cars to line up.

Last summer I pulled into the station to gas up my car.  I'm friendly with all the kids that work there - we always shoot the breeze when they're filling my tank and I always tip them a few dollars for their effort (they have a sign saying not to tip but fuck that).  On this particular day this kid Alex happened to be working - he's a nice guy who I know fairly well and we've always had a good rapport.

A few minutes earlier, then we shook hands &amp; left.  Purely coincidentally when I got to the station the same guy happened to pull into the spot across the pump from me.  We'll call him Tim because I'm pretty sure that's what he said his name is.

Anyway

I was sitting in my car while the pump was running, then got out to thank me again/ chit chat while Alex filled his car.  The three of us were standing there, pumps running for both cars, just shooting the shit and making small talk.  Two other cars then pulled in, filling all of the pumps and causing a situation where I'd probably have to back out of my spot in order to leave.  On an ordinary day that's no big deal and I didn't think anything of it at the time.

Then a shiny new Subaru with New Jersey plates pulled up behind me... *right* behind me.  I didn't even notice it until the woman behind the wheel honked her horn.  She yelled out the window ""Hey! *Stop talking!* You're in the way and *I'm* in a hurry!"" and honked again.  We all gave her dirty looks, and we went back to our conversation.

Thirty or so seconds later the pump did that ""THUNK"" noise indicating my tank was full.  I got in my car, I'm in a HURRY?!"" in that annoying, upward-inflection &amp; bitchy tone of voice.

At this point I was fairly irritated but not enough for a confrontation.  I had my gas and this woman wasn't worth getting mad over.  So I went to back out of my spot (the car in front of mine was still there, and that was that.  So I put my reverse lights on &amp; sat there waiting for her to get the message and back up - I figured that she would immediately let me out if she was in such a hurry to get gas and be on her not-so-merry way.  5 or so seconds passed.... and the woman honked again, then fucking *pulled forward* another foot until her bumper was 6 inches from mine.  At this point it was obvious to everyone else who was present that moving my car was out of the question - there were the gas pumps to my left and the brick-fucking-wall of the gas station building immediately to my right.  I was about to get out of my car and ask her to move when she honked one final time.

All of a sudden it was like a switch turned on, waving of the arms, flipping her off, etc.  It hadn't noticed this until he started yelling, but he was a pretty muscular guy &amp; cut quite an intimidating figure as he walked towards her car yelling his fucking face off:

""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME LADY?  YOU JUST FUCKING BOXED HIM IN

Throughout his tirade I was standing there, flipping us all off as she went.  The three of us stood there and watched her drive the few hundred yards to the north-bound highway on ramp, and then onto the highway..... And then Alex started to crack up laughing and said ""the next exit with a gas station isn't for another 17 miles so if she runs out of gas she's *fucked*""",,False,,t5_2vg7t,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16n7g7/btch_boxes_me_in_at_gas_station_and_gets_verbally/

I’ve ended up volunteering at the county fair this summer since I need a certain number of volunteering hours to get full credit on my GPA. Yesterday

My job was at the 4-H booth, in elementary school, walked straight up to my table. She was carrying three pies she’d baked herself and wanted to have judged. I simply tried not to look at her, but under the pretense of adjusting the pie lid, which was on the table in front of me, she whispered in my ear, “Hello again

That was what she had called me when I was in fifth grade and she was in sixth. At that moment, or else I’d lose a valuable volunteer position I would need for years to come. 

My work partner volunteered me to carry this girl’s pies over to the display risers. I vowed to do my job perfectly
My shoelace had somehow come untied, I fell, pies flying out of my hands. My chin slammed into the floor and I bit down hard on my tongue. Even the blood filling my mouth could not keep me from looking up joyfully as the three pies she’d worked so hard to make flew through the air. The lids were not secure and flew off. 

Two of them landed on the floor. One splattered on the risers. All three were ruined. 

I hadn’t even meant to do it, she would not have a chance for a ribbon, and she would not get her hard work displayed with everyone else’s. I turned around and saw her standing there, openmouthed, as her mother rushed forward to try salvaging the confections. The work partner helped me to my feet and ran off to get paper towels. 

I stood there, waved with my fingers and smiled winningly. Her mother left without a word and she followed.

A family of three walked by on my left. A teenage boy, so they had no business with me. I was sitting there, staring into space, chin on my hands, waiting for someone to arrive with a box of vegetables or flowers for me to catalogue. As the father passed by, he grabbed the table and yanked it out from under me, shouted “WAKE UP” and continued walking

Immediately, if they were entered. However, there were at least fifteen different types of pole green beans entered already. If you’ve ever seen a fair book that tells the classes of vegetables, you know how small the print is and how easy it is to make a mistake.

I wrote that he had pole type beans on the tag and put it on the risers, my time was now.

She asked me why, and she always used to be compassionate to others. I told her that her assumption I was in the wrong deeply insulted me, that I would never bully or hurt another student in the school. She admitted that she had never heard a complaint against me from any student or teacher.

Without another argument left in her, and walked out of her office.

I post in BadRoomates quite often...since I have six of em, and spends his days getting wasted, high, smoking cigars and repeating the process (recently baked a load of Space cake, the entire lower floor stinks of weed now...)


Anyway, and my alcohol got left downstairs on the side in the kitchen..a few months in I finally go down to fetch it, and discover a shot glass in front of my Rum, and the bottle over half gone. It was an -expensive- bottle, and he was the only one who was down there to pinch it, he'd been enjoying a shot or two whenever he felt like it. I rescued my bottles, and a few weeks later finished off what was left...but kept the bottle.

I bought another (cheap) bottle of rum

and filled it the rest of the way up...

with *laxatives*


Now, justiceporn worthyness (or perhaps simply cruel?). Less than a week later, he held a party with a bunch of friends, loud music, getting absolutely wasted. At some point during the night he got high enough...or ran out of alcohol, to simply grab the -new- bottle of his 'friends' rum from the kitchen, and shared it out amongst his friends...


God



**EDIT - lets see if I can't respond to a few of you en masse.**

**Apparently important!:- Someone mentioned this is important. The Rum is left in the pile of bottles we all leave in the kitchen, this is the unofficial housemate booze pile, its where we leave stuff to drink so that we don't have to keep it in our rooms (someone below said that makes it the equivalent of a storage cabinet), that doesn't make it for public consumption. He didn't touch the wine or cans, or others spirits it seems, just the nice looking rum.**

**1. It was left in my house, the place I pay rent to live in. It was left in a communal area, which is part of what I pay rent for. At no point or no length of time does it become 'okay' for someone to steal from you. There is a Nintendo Wii in the communal living room, it's been there for five months now, it doesn't mean it's 'okay' to steal it and sell it elsewhere. It's not your property, don't steal it.**

**2. Two months wasn't a casual ""Lol it'll be fine"", it got left down there, I assumed in a communal space it would be fine, two months later I need it to drink, fetch it and realise it's almost all gone. And it could be there for nine months, it's a communal space, not someone's private room I dumped it in, at no point can someone else steal it

**3. Some people seem to have got the wrong impression about the house layout. He's not my roommate, one bathroom, and one living room that are communal spaces. It's three floored, three bedrooms on the top floor, three bedrooms and a kitchen on the middle floor, and one bedroom, one kitchen, and the rum was left in the bottom floor kitchen

**4. When I refer to weed and the floor stinking, it's the communal floor, the living room, hallways, kitchen, bathroom (and presumably his bedroom) that stinks. There are three asthmatics in the house, one of which is severe enough to warrant regular checkups. He knows this, the other smokers stand by an open window or go outside to smoke, considerate

**5. The other, I never offered him the rum, he simply took it when he was high and drunk and shared it amongst his friends, it's entirely his fault they suffered as well, not mine, in exactly the same way leaving a car unlocked so that it can be stolen doesn't make you liable for the people the thief runs over. I expected him to take a few shots of it, and suffer the consequences

**6. the first port of call if you decide to assume something is communal, for the record [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ADMIRAL-RODNEY-St-Lucian-Bottle/dp/B004EY5FQC/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359667779&amp;sr=1-1) is the expensive rum he stole. It's quite clearly not cheap stuff random guests bring to a party and never come back for.**

**7. The guests he brought over didn't take it themselves. He brought the bottle in, I'd have removed the bottle until a time when only he would have been affected, to avoid strangers having to suffer. Also to note, we made sure to keep an eye on all the suffering guests and told them to drink plenty of water when they worked out they were 'ill'. All of them are entirely fine and healthy now, no one needed the doctor, a hospital, or anything more than plenty of water and access to the toilet.**",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17mlfe/you_like_my_booze_heretry_this/

My relative being the kind person that he is pulled along side the gentleman offering him a ride to the nearest petrol garage to fill this tank up.

Now on the drive back a traffic cop cut my relative up on a duel carriageway and sped off. Being the driver that he is he started bitching to passenger he is dropping off about this. The ""officers"" in the traffic car infront of him must have seen this and decided to pull him over to have a little chat.

They requested his license and asked what the problem was and when he explained they decided he deserved a ticket. He protested about this but there was no stopping the cop from giving him this ticket

The cop clearly enraged by this thinks he will get his little bit of revenge by giving the passenger a ticket also. He requested his details (and this is when the revenge is).

I got into the office and discretely handed out the four donuts to my friends in the department. They loved me for it. That was just a bonus though - the real prize was the all-important

I waited until Hamplanet got up to make a coffee. I crept over to his desk, and now it was time to just sit back and enjoy the show. *ooooooh I am sooooo diabolical!*

Hamplanet started walking back to his desk. When he was about 10 feet away, ""Hell yeah!"" and sat down, ready to devour the sweet donut deception in front of him.

The next 10 seconds was the greatest moment of my life. I watched on with indescribable anticipation

Hamplanet opened the box, the most perplexed, what-in-the-actual-titty-sprinkles-just-happened look washed across his face, and he just stared at the box for 5 seconds in disbelief. Then he looked up, directly at me, with the most fantastic how-could-you-do-this-to-me look on his face. It was like I'd just kicked a puppy down a staircase, and it was *supremely* satisfying.

So I am currently employed at Chuck E. Cheese working as a cashier that bounces back and forth between registers and the merch counter (you know, I really do not like children... at all.  Oh well, it is just what you make of it; that, and it is a job for the mean time.

One day we are just beyond busy, I had every intention of going back to the merch counter to help my co-worker since the line was still long.  As I was about to step away, the older lady that was behind the guy slammed her purse down on the counter and just scowled at me as if she knew I was going to walk away.  'Okay,' I thought, 'this is no big deal.  I'll just help her and be done with it.'

When I was hired I was told that I had to suggestive sell because it helps bring in more money, I will be speaking with you manager *takes a look at my nametag lanyard* TokkiGoesRawr.”  Now mind you, since coffee is not exactly a highly ordered item, the coffee is just in one of those hot water dispensers so it stays warm/hot all day and it is made as soon as we open, so at 9 AM.  This all happened around 5 PM.

Honestly I did not think I did anything wrong, she was talking to my manager.  I hand her the coffee and she scowls at me once more and says “see, I am talking to your manager like I said I would.”  With a stoic face I reply “I'm sorry” (obviously not sincere).  She retorts with “that's not sincere enough!”  Once again, with stoic face unwavering, I reply with “I'm sorry”.  Her scowl just intensifies and she goes back to talking to my manager and says to him “she's only apologizing because you're here!  I come here all the time and I have NEVER had anyone treat me with such disrespect and carry such a bad attitude!”  My manager turns to me and just tells me to take 5 in the break room.  No big deal.  I am STILL not even remotely phased or upset.  Later he pulls me aside and tells me “she has complained about EVERYONE here, so to be honest with you, I just wanted you off the floor so it looks like I am doing something about it.  I'm not even mad or upset with you.”  I just smile at him and tell him I'm going back to merch.  

***SIDE NOTE***
Now

Two hours pass by and as I am stocking the merch counter, and he even threw in a “please”.  Honestly, it is such a rarity for kids now-a-days to have and know manners, that it just always makes me smile whenever a kid can use it.  Just as I was about to hand him his stickers and send him on his merry little way the old lady was like “I know you saw me standing here!  That little boy was behind me!”

I gave her this flabbergasted look because honestly, I just add them just the way they are.  OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!	  He is JUST 3 tickets shy of getting his coveted lollipop.  

“Sorry kid

“Can't you just give it to him?!” she screams at me.

“Sorry

She is fuming as her kid flops on his back on the floor and throws a huge temper tantrum.  She snatches the receipts out of my hand and literally drags he grandson out of the store

I go back to the sad little forgotten kid and I give him his stickers and throw in a couple pieces of candy on the house.  He smiles an adorable smile and repeats “thank you thank you thank you!” as he runs to find his parents.

The community was overall a non-pretentious bunch with the glaring exception of two members who thought their shit didn't stink and took it upon themselves to shit on everybody else's work at every turn. Typical internet know-it-alls with a nasty penchant for putting people down and making them feel bad for sharing their poetry with others. Over time

We got tired of the community being torn-apart by these guys and hatched a plan: we created 5 new user accounts. One contributed nothing but lesser-known poems by Sylvia Plath. Another nothing but obscure William Carlos Williams. You get the idea. The others were e.e. Cummings

Over the course of three months or so

However, shit all over the work at every turn, even offering their own ""improvements"" every now and then. It was hilarious to see these guys offering their 'critiques' of poets like T.S. Eliot and Sylvia Plath as if the authors of these poems were just anonymous, unenlightened and angsty teenagers on the internet.

After three months of this we finally unveiled the truth in a lengthy post that referenced every single poem and it's true author. There was a day or so of futile and desperate justifications by the two overlords of all-things-poetic. They tried to make the distinction that there was a reason these particular poems were not-well-known by the general public, and, if it got too bad we would pull the same stunt. 

EDIT: I should clarify: these two guys weren't assholes so much as they were *pretentious* assholes. This was a site for **amateur** poets and these two guys treated every submission as if it was meant to be ready to join the ranks of the immortals.

It's possible that at least one of them was a literature professor at a community college. Nevertheless, they did manage to offer something constructive, but, that was not the norm. 

They were arrogant fucks who got-off on taking advantage of the fact that maybe they did have more knowledge and expertise on the subject of poetry than the rest of us who never made such claims.

*Hi ShaneL79

*This is [neighbors name]. I just witnessed a grey honda civic with license plate ____ hit your car as it was parking. They moved to the other side after hitting your car

This neighbor was a nice older woman I had met a few times in the parkade of our building. On this day I was parking in the visitor parking because it was a better spot and empty during the day. 

After doing some investigating and evidence gathering I was able to determine that the honda civic next to me had a fresh scratch that started and stopped at the exact same height as the one on my car. I knew it was fresh because there was a loose black chip of paint (the color of my car) hanging from it. My car had grey paint in the scratch. The scratch itself was about 4"" tall by about 16"" long. There was also a unique deeper impression about a 1/3 of the way up the scratch that lined up perfectly with a protruding piece of the civics bumper. Took photo's with measuring tape on each part.

As I was doing my ""investigation"" the owner came out. A girl in her 20's along with her boyfriend. I confronted them but as expected they denied it despite the mounting evidence to the contrary.

I explained my situation to the building manager and then went to the police. The police were impressed with my evidence and said they would send someone out. When I got back to my apartment the building manager explained that she had the car towed for parking in the visitor parking spot. They normally don't care

The cop showed up shortly after and looked through my evidence and spoke to my witness. She said she was going to press charges for hit and run but it would be a few days since she was on days off as soon as she left my place.

A couple days later I get a call from another cop telling me they are no longer pressing charges because there wasn't enough evidence. I was shocked and asked what type of evidence he needed is a witness and scaled photo's didn't work. He told me he never seen the photo's and my witness told me she didn't talk to anyone else.

That night I got a call from the cars owner demanding I repay her the $375 it cost her for towing and impound charges. Claiming it was all my fault and the police told her she was innocent.

Another couple days later and I called the original cop I dealt with who was now back on duty. She explained her partner screwed up and confused the files for two similar cases she had. She explained they were still pressing charges but were having trouble getting a hold of the girl.

Knowing that the girl wanted money I came up with a plan to meet her at a specific time so the cop could charge her. When I showed up the girl did as well with two guys who I assume were there to intimidate me. Once I confirmed it was the girl

A few weeks later I realized that this girl was parking in the visitor parking overnight on a weekend. It was a holiday weekend so the building manager office was closed so there was no fear of parking in those spots. The best part was I was on the 20th floor of our building and had a balcony looking straight down on visitor parking.

Needless to say, and asked to borrow his phone (to text myself his number).

I requested the bartender distribute them along with the napkins to the most single males in the room. I gave him a reassuring wink and a nice tip, and took a seat next to the homophobic shitbag who couldn't keep his mouth shut. 

In a mere matter of minutes, he comes flying out of the bar, ranting about how all the fags are hitting on him and it's gross and they're disgusting and he shouldn't be there. I agree, and hail him a cab.

Back in the late 80s/early 90s, Laura has a good 3 or 4 inches on Sara, and it wasnt much different back then.

At some point, multiple times a day.  Sara is a tough cookie, and for the most part didnt cry too much, but most 6 year olds would probably break down a little after too much of this.  Oh, Sara would try to fight back, but her being 6 yrs old and Laura being 9 and much taller than her, Sara's punches didnt have as much of an impact

After 4 or 5 days of this happening

So Sara finds the thinnest, ""I bet you cant punch me as hard as you can!""  What bullying older sibling is going to turn that down?  So Laura cocks her hand back, and swings with all her might.  My wife said she heard 2 noises.  The thud of Laura hitting the book, and the crunch of laura's hand buckling from the pressure.  Instantly, Laura dropped to the floor crying hysterics.  Their dad rushes over and askes them what the heck happened.  Sara explained the whole situation with the biggest grin on her face, to which her dad responded, ""Way to go Sara!  That will teach Laura to punch you like that!""

I had been expecting the call for two days when the school called me to come pick her up because she had been in a fight.

He had pushed her down, grabbed him by his head and slammed her knee into his face, then kicked him in the testicles when he hit the ground and rolled.

I told the principal

The second time

They told me that they were aware of it. Then why hadn't it stopped? I warned them, I was going to give her permission to defend herself accordingly.

As a poor student in a new city, she saw my new room mate setting up the living area and greeted her with a pleasant ""Howdy!"". This bleach blond, looked my mother up and down with a disdainful look

  I opened the fridge we were meant to share, apples, etc).  Upon viewing our bathroom, I found that she had moved my stuff around so she got all the prime space in the cabinets and the best towel rack (don't act like you don't know there is a better towel rack in your shared bathroom lol). I was upset about all this (mainly the issue with my mother, so I text her asking if we could have a little chat).
We met later that night and she listened to what I had to say but failed to apologize. Never one to raise my voice or express the depths of my frustration, you can have some fridge space"" and decided not to pursue things over for the sake of peace in our apartment.

   What I did not know is that there was a different reason other than ""she is just a brat"" that she was treating me like this. I heard her speaking on the phone to someone that ""she did not understand why she had to live with someone ""like her(me)"" and that she ""did not want to live here anymore"". I did not get the big deal, but I'm a third generation American. I'm proud of my roots but also where I am now). She got really drunk with her girls that night and went out on the town. She began the weekly tradition of bringing home a guy from the bars, sleeping with him, and leaving him face down and buck naked on our shared living room couch (never understood why he did not just sleep in her room). I was hurt. I'm a proud Latina and never really thought hard that an educated individual would be so ignorant as to judge me solely by my race. I stewed about it and being timid and not the arguing kind, chose to fall into the most awkward living situation ever with us living side by side, completely ignoring the other's presence.

   I got sick and tired real quickly of her sexual escapades and drunken messes (Did I mention she faked orgasms so loudly that even turning up my Ipod all the way could not cover the squealing sound?). I got sick of hearing her tell her mother about the ""Mexican"" and how unfair it all was. I spent a lot of time away from the apartment largely to avoid her

   Towards the end of our time together I thought... you know what? I have put up with this long enough; Time for some payback. I thought of all the things that might annoy her and remembered the Dos Equis incident at the very beginning. If she was going to ignorantly judge me on stereotypes

  I called up a bunch of my Latino friends, while listening to ranchero music as loud as possible. We talked about her in Spanish loud enough for her to hear, making sure we threw in her name ever so often so that she could know she was the topic we were laughing about. She came out of her room around 4am when everybody was snug in our little Tijuana of sleeping bags, and I could nearly feel the intensity of the disgust rolling off of her. It was quiet enough for me to listen as I heard her sobbing in her room, on the phone telling someone that ""They"" were here, and were so loud earlier she could hardly hear herself think. Gee, I wonder how that feels?

The rest of the semester I hardly saw her

She starts telling her friend about girls willing to go out with ugly guys for cash or drug, basically saying they are worst than prostitutes (which I agree with) and glancing directly at me. My BF got really, really pissed, turned around and look at her directly in the eyes and tells her: No she's not with me because I'm rich, which was done in a record time I must say.

FFW to end of the meal, almost throwing a fit for pretty much nothing (turns out the sandwich was totally fine). So we told him about what happened and learned that she use to come at least once a week, usually drunk off her ass and complain and pass comment on everyone.

Since we were all more or less headed in the same direction, and since all were geology majors, we were required to take rather a lot of chemistry. Inorganic was fun, organic was even a larger bales of cheers, but detonic chemistry was were all the really inspired stuff transpired. 

Now

Also he (whom we shall dub ‘Mark’) was an avid environmentalist. 

No

He hated, oil and gas, hell, even dimension stone quarries and gravel pits were objects of his not-infrequent vociferous denunciations) and let us all know, full well, he was studying not only geology, but the ‘softer

Bleedin’ waterheads. 

However, cigar-chomping, booze-swilling, small-furry-animal-abusing petroleum types. 

Two key points: he didn’t take the same amount of chemistry as we (foregoing detonic chemistry for aqueous chemistry) and he loathed just being in the same classroom with us evil, for that matter, how to make) certain contact explosives, and he eschewed going to class. Rather, he’d learned that if you give a dorm room’s door a good short, sharp shock (i.e., bashing the door just above the lock with the palm of your hand), the doors were so flimsy

He’d hit everyone, before CSI and DNA analysis). But, more than once, he was discovered with Xerox’ed notes obviously not in his handwriting. We never confronted him (I mean, where’s the fun in that?) but did concoct a plan, so devious, to extract our little slice of payback. 

Remember detonic chemistry (the science of what makes things go *BOOM*)? Well

Contact explosives are truly wonderful compounds. Simplicity itself to whip up a batch (cheap as well, for fear of some less chemically-minded person trying to create a batch and end up blowing their eyebrows off, but there is one that I simply must mention: Nitrogen triiodide, good ol’ NI3. 

Very stable stuff when wet (which allows for easy transfer, boom and puff of purple, with the lightest touch when dry. 

So, we ‘entered’ (ahem) his dorm room and began to paint everything he owned with NI3. It doesn’t take much and when dry, it really doesn’t show up well at all, especially against darker surfaces. Safety note: we only used the smallest amounts (though everywhere) more to pixilate, rather than annihilate.

Keys tossed into the change bowl *BLAM*. 

Stereo switched on *KERPOW*.

Fridge opened *FAGROON*.

Mark realized he was well and truly boned. He began to get a bit manic and ran around his room slapping everything and recoiling every time some heretofore inanimate object started lusting for his giblets.  

*BLAM*, *KERBLOOIE* and other associated noises of really, really rapid chemical decomposition. So much so in fact, that his room was actually leaking purple smog which started drifting down the hall in small cloudlets.

I was never a popular kid/well liked kid, but nobody rubbed it in my face except Katie Hopkins (not her real name). She was a right little smarmy bully. Had a real thing against me. Making fun of my loneliness, my hobbies and just being a cow in general.

**EVENT:** About 1/4 through the year, then actually doing it. 

When I finished

The date where everybody had to hand their project in came and I had my potato pheasant in a Tupperware container. I presented it

Then Katie Fucking Hopkins appears and steals my Tupperware with the potato inside it. She starts teasing me and runs away with it. I try to get the teacher to get her to give it back (mainly because I couldn't run for shit) and she says she put it in my bag (which she didn't) and I was just lying to get her in trouble.

Anyway, Katie's a little turd, and we're at the point where it's 3/4 through the year.

Unfortunately, these 3 men and 3 women were the biggest jerks I've ever seen. They were nice to me (at first) but clearly unhappy with sitting across the aisle from this older couple.

I had to hear lots of loud copulation which frequently made me want to barf

Some of the highlights of his behavior:
Couldn't find his shoes and told my mother I probably stole them and proceeded to call me all kinds of vulgar names

Tried convincing my mother to send me away to a boarding school in England (he was British) so he wouldn't have to deal with me.

One time I was in the shower and he came home from work and started banging on the door and screaming vulgar insults at me. For what I am not sure. WHen I came out he was sitting at the dining room table not moving

He started getting into guns a lot and would spend his time in the basement messing with them. On his way up the stairs from the basement he would pound his fist on the wall and make my pictures fall in my bedroom. I slept with a door up against my door handle so no one could get in because I was terrified he'd kill me in my sleep.

He threatened to beat my mother. In his defense

His 20 something son stole from my room. (I was 11-12 at the time).

So now for the revenge.
This man had barely any hair but he was very vain and would spend HOURS primping in the bathroom. In the morning before work and in the evening also. We had one bathroom and so for years I was forced to wash my hair

Next I collected all the dead bug corpses in the basement and garage I could find. We lived in the woods so I got quite the nasty collection. I dumped this under and in his pillow case.

He was a ski instructor and skied all the time. Anyone who skis knows that you have to push your foot hard to get it into a boot. I placed tiny light bulbs in each pair of his ski boots. Don't know if it worked but whatever.
I probably should have taped tacks inside his shoes too.

We had a manager who was a server for only a couple of months before that and didn't know shit about the business. When I say manager

For a couple of weeks prior to this incident this manager was being verbally abusive to staff. Whenever he got stressed out it was like he would explode and say the worst possible thing imaginable. Finally he did this to one of our well liked and pregnant waitresses calling her a whore and her husband a piece of shit. Being highly emotional she cried and everyone was pissed.

A couple of days after he insulted the pregnant waitress just so happened to be April Fools Day. There were three of us scheduled to work that afternoon. He just so happened to be kind of rude to us while we did the typical restaurant setup. 

I convinced the other two servers to play along. I called my girlfriend at the time and had her call in a reservation for 30 people. I then had the hostess do the same. I had a couple more people do the same. The kitchen staff were in on it (we didn't want them prepping for massive amounts of people and wasting good food). 

So we have multiple large party reservations all scheduled for the same time which was right away. He comes running over to us and told us to setup the tables for these large parties. We told him it was too many for just us and that he would have to help out (which was his job). He refused and went and sat at the bar and watched TV while we were supposed to be setting up.

We went to him and said ""fuck this

Finally the kitchen manager came out and said the owners were there. I knew the owners pretty well so they came directly to me and asked what happened. I told them about the fake reservations

At that moment I looked at the manager and his face was red and he was sweating badly. He did not look well. Then it happened, the chairs, everything his eyes could focus on long enough to yell at. His yelling wasn't making sense. He began knocking over chairs and tables. Then just like it began, it ended. He walked out. 

I was promoted to this manager position. He was not allowed back in the building. 

I later found out that when he left the restaurant he checked himself into a hospital. Apparently he had serious mental issues and our little prank triggered them worse than he had seen before. I really did feel horrible about that

It wasn't uncommon for the mormon kid's parents not to let them hang out with you or being shunned by your new friend's pals.  In the third grade, do you understand me?""

I would see her at school and we would say hi to each other, but she pretty much went back to hanging out with this boring churchy girl in our grade, lets call her 'Robin'.

Part 2:  The Act:  Robin was horribly rude to me and made a habit of rubbing it in my face that she was in good with the mutually coveted friend.

I had partnered with a friend, we both did really well in this class but we accepted anyway. 

We had a month to complete the project

These girls clearly were not as concerned with their marks as my friend and I were


My friend and I worked hard, mascots etc and glued them to a big poster board to hang on the wall behind us while we gave our presentation. We found videos (the ""why is the red man red"" song from Peter Pan, news reports etc), we even prepared a reading where we changed some of the language in a news report and talked about how a simple change in language painted a totally different picture of the story.

About a week before it was all due I emailed the girls about sending me their part so I could add it into the cards. Of course they hadn't completed it yet. BB1 promised to have it to me by the next morning. 

I emailed again the next afternoon

Naturally I went to my prof and explained the situation to her

Apparently they decided to go to the program coordinator and claim that they sent me their work and I claimed it as my own. The decision was made, that BB1 and BB2 would present in another seminar the next week and I would hand over a copy of the project.

Half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn, they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they'd leave them there until the race was over.

As I mentioned, but he went into town, came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid, and coated the whole lawn in the stuff. Come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldn't steer or brake.

Two made it out without much damage, one with busted front suspension, one wall of the student rental totalled, a bunch of arrogant students kicked out, and a few skidmarks on dad's lawn. Total cost to my dad? four bucks in dishwashing liquid, a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours, who were pretty decent people.

I chatted on these apps as well but I never felt the need to broadcast my business and kept my ringer off.


The Petty Revenge:

Cell coverage in the office is spotty/non-existent.  In order to chat on the apps he needed to use the office wifi.  I don't have control of the wifi or the cell towers but was still able to put a wrench in the works.  

I picked up a cheap Belkin access point and configured it to broadcast with the same ssid


Unexpected Benefits:

I sit fairly close to some offices for mid/high level managers. My rogue access point kicked all their iPads off the wifi network.

**Scenario:** My friend's birthday was this past Tuesday and he was having a small little get together at his place before we went to the clubs later. Everything was going well and we eventually got to a club that night.

I ordered myself a drink at the venue and was enjoying it when our group decided to go for a small bit of dancing.

I placed my hand on the drink and tried to explain some more that she may have taken mine by accident because it was definitely my drink. She then jerked the drink away from me and spilled half of it on the floor and over me. At this point I didn't care for the drink any more and just said ""Fuck it

The back of my parents property that connects to the neighbor is a 6 foot high retaining wall(the back street is slightly higher for some reason) that is their backyard. The garage butts up against this retaining wall and the shed is a few feet away from the wall. Zoning laws in my states say you don't need a permit to build something small like a shed if it is 10 feet away from the property line and the shed is 5 feet from the wall. So they want my dad to tear down the shed and move it five feet. My parents pay to have a surveyor come and tell them where the precise line is for the property line.

One particular afternoon, so we knew that the sales ladies tended to hover so we weren’t bothered by it. 

So as we were enjoying ourselves, I heard a rude saleslady tell a customer that she was too chubby to fit into their clothes and would the foreigner please get out? I turned around – and there was my friend, getting picked on by this… this… *bitch* of a sales lady, trying to explain that the item she wanted to buy wasn’t even for her and she was buying it for someone else, all the while nervously stuttering in what was obviously not her first language. And the whole time, the salesbitch had the **nerve** to look smug about having the upper hand because the other person couldn’t even comeback to what she was saying, nevertheless apologize!  Meanwhile, we sort of stumbled out of the store

Later that week, I was still upset. Furious, even. I decided that I would get my petty revenge. So I stalked the saleslady; I would go back to the store every once in a while in hopes of seeing her there. It wasn’t until about a month later that I managed to catch her and by then my anger had cooled – but my desire for revenge hadn’t. I wanted to get even. 

I walked into the store pretending to talk to an imaginary person my cell phone – but in English. Now, management tends to hire people who can speak English (relatively speaking). So, I’m browsing around in the store, the salesbitch hovering at my shoulder until I pretend to turn around and catch her eye. Having overheard my “conversation”, she comes over with a toothy grin and asks me – in English – if she can help me with anything. She was clearly proud of her ability to speak “fluently”. Well, I wasn’t about to take that from her. I proceeded to grill her about every article of clothing in the store and then some, purposely using longer words than necessary and asking if items could be shipped to different places and if they had different colors and if the sky was blue and the grass was green and whether the cow jumped over the moon – all in English. By the end she was visibly sweating and struggling to please my uppitiness in hopes of getting a sale. 

Finally another co-worker (boss, and have a nice day” and then walked out after having wasted her time.

---------------

Norman was my locker partner in grade 7.  I guess our school was too old/poor for each kid to have their own.

Norman was in grade 8 and was much, was extremely afraid of him.

Now then...

Every day I would bring my lunch in a brown bag.  And Norman would steal them at least once a week.  He wouldn't rip it out of my hand or anything

I let it go once

I could not simply ask Norman to stop taking my lunches, you could never tell somebody to stop stealing your lunch without hard evidence that they were actually the one stealing them!  Why that would be the most outrageous accusation anybody could make and would most certainly be deserving of several thrashings and a lifetime of being on the bully's shit-list!

Does this make sense to an adult?  No.  But when you're 12 years old the rule is this: the school menace does what he wants when he wants and your job is to take it and like it.

Anyways...

I knew I had to do something to stop this.  I also knew that I had to do it in such a way that if he ever confronted me about ""getting him back""

I hatched the perfect plan.  I make the most sumptuous lunch any kid could want.  Two luscious PB &amp; J sandwiches with the jelly bursting at the seams and not one

At lunch time I walked as casually as possible to my locker

The lunch was gone.

I won.

Flawless victory.

What Norman didn't know, oily peanut butter keeping it in place.

Not a word was ever spoken and he always treated me with a lot more respect after that day.

There was a certain twinkle in his eye the next morning when he said ""Hi Plorf"".  The look was undeniably there.  It said ""You got me dude.  Checkmate.  Check Fucking Mate.""

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16l56a/delayed_revenge_on_a_hs_teacher/) story reminded me of a three generational petty revenge story.

Now I have a similar story, but horribly sexist towards the male members of the class. In fact, not only had she been my teacher, she had also been my SO's (who is 4 years older than me) and my little sisters (who is 4 years younger than me).

Now, and is quite a tech head (now a mechanical engineer). He, however, was not exactly her favorite student. He wasn't loud or disruptive, just right when she wasn't, specially surrounding technology. 

One day, so my SO, who was already at the class computer setting things up, got up to turn the **POWER** on that connected to the projector, instead of by the remote she was using. Apparently this was so rage inducing that she yelled at him to sit down so she could fix it herself, and kept on pressing the same button on the remote, expecting it to work.

By this time, and my SO just wants to get his presentation over and done with. So he gets up again, and turns on the power, despite her continuously yelling for him to sit down. He then looked over at her. His exact words to her were:

**""Fuck you

And off he went to lunch. 

Now, and other teachers knowing that he was a well behaved kid at school. It was an amusing story we all told for a while.

Then it came to be MY turn to be in her class. 

So, but a good friend), told to me by various friends. It was notorious in the school now, and with my SO being my best friend at the time, I knew the circumstances surrounding it (along with the sexism going on)

I was sitting in the same class, and people were doing some assignments. However, one of the computers was not working.

Myself

So, the room is very hot, and the computer has gone and over heated. So I just say to leave it alone, and instead use another computer (there were two spare), while letting this one cool down. 

But no. The teacher comes up behind us

All she did was try and keep turning it on again and again

So, it will probably turn on just fine"". All I hear back is a barrage of nonsense about how it was 'working this morning' and that all the computers SHOULD work in this heat. She then told me to sit down and let the real computer people deal with it, while continuously trying to turn it on. My exact words were:

**""Fuck you

And off I went to lunch.

Now I didn't get off as lightly

**NOW, I've graduated from school, told my little sister all the fun tales I had from that school, and watched her go off into the same class, while I went to uni.

Now my sister is in the same position as my SO and I all those years ago. Except this time, and each student was loaned out an iPad from the school (don't ask me why. She said she never really used it, and would have preferred a laptop to borrow). 

My little sister is not as much as a techie as myself or my SO, looking on her iPad, she comes across an exercise given to her by the teacher that linked to a website that wouldn't work on the iPad (heavy flash content). 

So, and asked for an alternative site that would give her the same information. All she hears back is a tirade of assurances that the site SHOULD work, and she had probably done something wrong with her iPad to cause it not to work. 

My sister interjects, by visiting a few other safe for school sites with flash on them. This still does not convince my teacher, who, instead of listening to her concerns about actually wanting to learn (she was on a scholarship, requiring good grades), took her iPad away, and said she would return it later that week when she has the IT guys look at the 'obvious' problem that was wrong with it. Her exact words were:

**""Fuck you

And off she went to lunch.

Now, and became furious, trying to stop her from leaving, by standing in front of the door, rambling on about how she was going to be suspended for this. Unfortunately for her, my sister literally just climbed out the window next to the door, with her books and all

1352175928.0,12pmv9,One year of revenge,thenightbattles,421,46,26,"This occurred in my second year of university

* Apple- Apple was clever. She refused to stop smoking weed
* Orange- She was from a VERY small town
* Melon- Melon was the problem.

When you applied to the dorms, and I all wanted quiet, no guests and we all took school very seriously. Melon wrote the same thing on her application, but that was a lie. She wanted to party and she wanted to party hard.

It started with her leaving her room for days at a time, it wasn't bothersome, everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the RA and she came down, keys in hand and turned it off. But, it began happening 5 days a week and finally, I complained that this was driving me insane. Melon was given orders to fix the problem, she turned the function off.

Cleanliness: There were 2 bathrooms to a dorm room and Apple and I shared, threatening her and this began the bullying (I didn't learn about this for months).

Revenge the first: I walked into the dorm room and smelled pot. I checked Apple's room, fully knowing that the 4 of us agreed to have no smoking at all. The fine was huge, and I hate the smell of any smoke. I casually walked down to the RA's room and told her I smelled smoke from Melon's room and I had some papers RA needed to sign anyway, so why not come to my room and sign the papers. RA comes, smells smoke, opens door and finds the smoking and Melon is busted with a 600$ fine.

Revenge the second: Melon liked friends, during midterms, finals and they'd be loud. I got sick of this immediately and I tried asking Melon to have people over when her roommates weren't sleeping. She told me to ""go fuck myself"" and if I wasn't having people over at 3-4AM, I must have no friends. Not sure about that logic. So, after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order, I got my revenge. She left her keycard on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room. The first time, I simply de-magnetised the card and the second time, so I came up with a better plan: I de-magnetized the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at 3AM with a bunch of drunk assholes

Revenge the third: No animals were allowed in the dorm. I was hearing scratching noises and I was worried about mice or rats (Melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage) and I knew she wasn't home but she'd propped her door open. I poked my head in and lo and behold

I think Melon began to get suspicious of me, she was sweet, shy and could not be mean if she tried. I was writing an essay once and I heard noise that was louder than my headphones and I slid them off and heard Melon SCREAMING and threatening Orange. I opened my door and saw Orange in the corner, crying and trying to ball up and Melon was standing over her just shrieking, I called the RA (for non nefarious purposes!) and grabbed Orange and let the RA restrain Melon. This time a big meeting was called and Orange spilled everything: Melon was stealing toiletries from her, eating Orange's food etc etc. 

The rules were set: 

* No guests in the room from 9pm to 9am (Melon was furious)
* Melon had to pay Orange for the toiletries and food
* Melon was told that one more toe out of line would incur a massive fine
* We were all told to basically stay away from each other
* When final exam time came

I felt really guilty that I never knew what Orange was going through

My last revenge: At this point, she's not home"" I called the RA and let the hammer fall. Her parents were called and they apologized to Orange and I and I'm not sure what the final fine was. She had planned to spend her third year of university in the dorms again, but the RA was so frustrated with her asshole behaviour, she wrote a letter to the head of the board and said that letting her back into the dorms would be a huge mistake.

The last time I saw her, every fine was because of me. There is something very pleasurable about anonymous revenge, I'm not sure how to explain it.

However, The low and mid settings on that heater were still great for heating the room to a comfortable temperature. 

She liked to crank the heater up to full blast, she always denied it, saying she only had it on low. What she didn't know is that when the heater is on high, every time it kicked on the lights in the rest of the house would noticeably dim so I knew how often she had it cranked up. 

We both played WoW back then. I was a very casual player but my friend, I don't remember anymore) so it was super important that she was in every raid. 

One day I had a frustrating day at work and just wanted to unwind by getting on the computer and not freeze so I turned my heater on low, screaming about how her raid was going to wipe now, stormed downstairs, flipped the breaker and stormed back to her room, all the while yelling and venting. I reminded her about keeping the heater down and she yelled at me to shove it.

Oh hell no. you don't yell at me in my own house. It was on.

From that time forward, but only while I was home. That wasn't good enough for me (she was still running up the electricity bill) so I started leaving my heater on low and locking the door when I left for work so she couldn't turn it off.

She still bitched about it up until we kicked her out (for something unrelated) but I just smiled and kept using my heater.

Once she read another girl's letter home without permission, and said ""I *thought* she said I could!"" Blatantly false. She just sort of did what she wanted, and then tried to weasel her way out of it however she could. 

Fast-forward to the event: on a pre-chosen day during the week, dress in black. Camou face paint. Be really quiet, listen to your counselors, if we say hide, HIDE! Kitchen raids are the most fun with the youngest kids, because they usually get super into it (and are less suspicious).

So the youngest girls cabin and the youngest boys cabin decide to do our kitchen raid together. We get all suited up in black, quietly (not really) down to the kitchen, and every so often I tell everyone to stop and whisper-yell ""HIT THE DECK"" so everyone has to get down on the ground and hide. It's great. 

Eventually we get to the kitchen and my co-counselor grabs the tray of snacks--random cookies and rice krispies and fruit-by-the-foot things. We tell all the kids they can take ONE

So as we have all the girls in our cabin in the bathroom brushing their teeth after the kitchen raid, pulls out an extra fruit-by-the-foot from her hoodie pocket that she swiped and tells her friend with a mischievous, shit-eating grin, ""Hey, look what I got!""

It was on one of these jobs that I took possession of 4 large professional amplifiers. More specifically 4, when bridged mono, put out 700+ watts each. Each of the amps had various problems, hence their retirement and my getting them for free.   

For those of you who are not familiar with amplifiers, car audio tends to be Class D.  Class H are the big boys, the amps that have 500 watts RMS + written on the side and they REALLY mean it.  Class D amps can be very high wattage too, but they were not around much in the early 90's, actually they were non-existent in the professional audio arena.

Artists arrives for sound check, I bring up the stage lights and make my final adjustments. Artist seems happy with everything - at least signed off on the sound and said nothing about the lights - and goes off to dinner.

After the initial shock wears off, dickwad this is nowhere near as bright as what I had up for you at sound check. You didn't seem to have a problem with it then."" And take his lights down by about half. Also interesting to note that the specific light he seemed to have the problem with is what's called a downlight. And it's just that, it's a light that points down on top of his head. In this particular setup it wasn't a true downlight but it was still a pretty steep angle and about 22 ft over his head. Pretty much only someone who thinks he personally and constantly communicates directly to God would have his gaze high enough to find it ""glaring.""

Things already look a bit odd as he's a bit dimmer than the rest of his band but hey, I digress. At this point, even my stage manager is suggesting that I kill all the stage lights but I do it one better. I take all of his lights out except for a single light pointed directly at him from the farthest point out in the house that I have. I leave it up at about 20% intensity - just enough that he can still see a light pointed at him but not enough to actually light him. Meanwhile, the rest of his band is still under full stage light. I take off my headset, get out of my chair, lay down on the floor in the control booth, pull out my phone and dick around on the 'webs for the rest of the show.

5 more minutes of this subject of conversation, I got off of my bike, went to hers, adjusted the friction to a medium ascent, and got back on my bike like nothing had happened. 

Barbie comes back, and tries to cycle. She immediately looks confused. What? Working out is meant to require effort? Since when? She tells her friend what happened, and her friend says bikes don't just change by themselves so it probably just feels different because she's tired. Ha. 

She starts to pedal, but when I'm walking out the door I see her again, hair up, sweaty brow, leaning over, properly going for it. Good for her.

Apparently they all come from the same area, about twenty minutes away by car, but since the other two didn't want to move out of their homes yet

I thought this was a bit weird, it'd be okay.

Wrong. From the very start they were constantly loud, they clogged the shower drains with their nasty weaves. It was gross, and all in all they were just horrible; if I ever spoke to them about these issues they'd get pissy and ignore me, and then I'd overhear them loudly complain about me. 

But what made me snap was when, they were just being lazy and cheap, deciding to split a £490 a month rent bill three ways. They'd been royal pains in the asses for two months and I was pissed.

Luckily, so theirs was the last room to be inspected. Now, if your room is in an unacceptable condition, the inspector leaves a note on your door to tell you that there will be a follow up inspection later that week...unsurprisingly, due to two extra people living in there illegally, their room was a tip and they got written up. After the inspector left, however

The mugs were picked up the Saturday before Mom's Day and we drove the hour to present the treasure to my MIL.  My MIL lives with my SIL

My MIL LOVES the mug. ""It is so precious!"" she said

SIL yells down the hall

I say, 'hey you whiny bitch, your birthday is coming, now we know what to get you. Chill out.'

SIL is visibly irked. Throws herself around in her typical 49yo pubescent-temper-tantrum way.  I again reiterate that she should probably chill since she has a birthday coming and maybe she will get a mug too. She barely speaks to anyone for the rest of the day. Which was fine. Really it was.

So we drive the hour and a half home on Sunday evening. We get The Badger bedded down for the night and the phone rings.

MIL: ""JJ is VERY jealous of the mug. She says that she thinks she should have one too.""

At first it was just little things. Mild annoyances, etc. However, before long it started getting...strange.


Somewhere around the middle of the summer, and I) just assumed that if you went to the bathroom after Jose, you would have to flush before doing your business.


From there things kept going downhill. Jose started bringing drunk friends over to pass out on the floor, but I love cooking and had recently learned how to flambe and make my own flavor extracts, both of which require hard alcohol). He put my fancy cooking knives in the dishwasher after I specifically told him not to and left notes on the knife block and dishwasher.

At the end of the day


For our first Hanukkah together my girlfriend, you can't use metal utensils in a non-stick pan as it will scrape the coating off, rendering the pan useless. Jose didn't care. One day I went into the kitchen to cook dinner and found my favorite pan with streaks gouged into the bottom, bits of slowly molding food still stuck to it as it sat unwashed on the stove.


And then came the juice. My girlfriend, the bottle would be empty. It didn't matter how full the bottle was, Jose would empty it. We left notes. We talked to him. We talked to the RA. Jose didn't care. Jose wanted juice, and it didn't matter where he got it or whose alcohol he was mixing it with.


I don't know why


One night Jose had a lady friend staying over who was his latest conquest. Haley got up the next day to go to the restroom and coincidentally got to the door at the same time as the lady friend. Haley glanced through the open door and saw that Jose had stayed true to form with his daily routine. Haley stopped


""Oh


I wasn't awake at the time but apparently the look on the lady friend's face as she discovered the ""present"" was glorious. She quickly got dressed and left before Jose woke up (he must have marked his territory at some point during the night).

After the toilet wars had subsided, the admins had given her room out to another student because she had a place to live.

So as was pointed out, party late into the night, and destroying my beloved cookware. 

Here's what happened next.

_

As someone who is new to the joys of a non-kosher &amp; non-hypoallergenic kitchen, I love spicy things. But this...this was practically inedible. Thankfully, I had just the thing to do with it, I just had to wait until an opportunity presented itself.

As I mentioned before Jose liked to steal my food

_


I think now would be a good time to explain what a Prarie Fire is. Not the natural disaster...the drink. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it

_


When they finished the round they had sitting on the coffee table I asked if any of them had heard of the Prarie Fire. None of them had so I explained what it was and offered to make them a round. They sounded interested so I grabbed the bottle and went into the kitchen.

For Jose I poured a full shot of habanero sauce

I had no beef with his friends so I mixed some mild Texas Pete with orange juice to get the right color (the habanero sauce was bright orange) and then mixed in the vodka before pouring.  I light the drinks and bring them into the living room where thankfully they were still coherent enough to know to blow out the shots before downing them on a count of three.

Did I mention how much Jose liked to brag about how good he is at taking shots in one go? Well
And then the burning started.

Think about the spiciest thing you've ever tasted. Now multiply that pain by at least 5. 7 if you've never had authentic ethnic food from a culture that prizes spiciness. Now imagine taking a shot of that.

Jose's eyes bulged and his face went completely red. His eyes were watering and he started coughing and retching. Bear in mind that his friends didn't know his shot was different so they were all laughing and taunting him, I explained to his friends what he had done to deserve something like this, then locked my room and left. When I got back there was an envelope on my door with some cash and an apology for taking our groceries. I appreciated the cash and note but I wasn't done yet. I still had a few jars of the hot sauce which, despite its heat, was very useful in small amounts when I wanted to add heat to something. And with Jose I had so many things I could add heat to.

Let me prelude by saying this : my dad is a MASTER of petty revenge...  I'm have many stories to share.

I just discovered this sub



The restaurant in question was on the edge of a swampy area and did not have a proper parking lot.  Instead, people would park anywhere, and there would be about 40 cars in the lot, maximum.  When we would direct traffic, we could squeeze over 80 before we had to form a line.


A major part of the job was keeping a couple areas clear - neighbors' driveways and the trash dumpster.  This story involves the dumpster.


On this particular mid-90's Saturday (both the year and the temp) it was about 6PM and the place was starting to get busy.  I was about 14 or 15 at the time, on the other hand, people would listen, for the most part.  So this guy comes in with a full load of people, I think 4 or 5, in a brand new Mercedes.  I'm not sure what model, but I know it was really damn expensive.  The whole thing was mirror shiny with nice rims and leather interior.  He lets the passengers out and then picks his spot.  We had space for about three cars right next to the restaurant entrance, taking up all three spots and putting his passenger door close enough to the doors to the dumpster area that you couldn't open them without hitting the car.  My dad decides to take this one and approaches as the driver exits.


""Excuse me sir


His response was an immediate ""I certainly will NOT!"" as he shook his head like a flabbergasted 18th century judge.  He then turned his back and walked away as the others who came with him chucked


My dad smiled politely and called after them ""Ok


He then turned to me and said ""watch the lot for a few...""


Dad then strolled over to our car.  Now, so at the time we were driving around the 1980-something Plymoth-something minivan that he had bought for a couple hundred bucks.  This thing was a wreck.  The interior was shit-brown/red, we were missing a side mirror, the windshield was streaked, I think a tail light was out, no hub-caps, no AC, and to top it all of there was duct tape holding the engine together (literally


My dad parallel parks this travesty of a van within 2 inches of the driver's door of the Mercedes.  The only reason it even worked so close is because the mirror on that side was missing.  My dad then crawls over to the passenger seat to let himself out.  He locks the car (heheh


About an hour and a half later Mr. Mercedes comes back out and approaches his car stating loudly ""WHAT THE HELL?!?!?""


He looks over at my dad and may have made a crack about us not doing our jobs


""I know


He then walked to a safe distance so we could watch they guy as he was forced to crawl in through the passenger window (because he parked too close to the dumpster to open either of those doors)


I can just imagine what his face must have been as he saw my dad and myself waving at him through his rear view mirror as he drove away.  I think my dad told me later that night something like


""I can get away with stuff like that...  You probably shouldn't try.""

He ordered 2 pairs of $500 cowboy boots on the company credit card and overnighted them from texas. He and the father both shared the same first name so I hid the package until the son went out for lunch

When the son came back from lunch the father was standing in the front of the store wearing the brand new cowboy boots and berated him for what seemed like 15minutes straight

His sister was just as bad, and made all of us sit around in a circle and take notes at a daily ""FYI Meeting"" that commenced 1 hr before the store opened every morning. Afterward she would call out random people and check to see if you really took notes and if you got caught faking it or not doing it correctly you were docked pay or fired. At the end of each week you had to photocopy and hand in your original notes. BTW, that extra hour everyday never showed up in your paycheck since it was on ""your time"" because the store wasn't open yet. yeah.

One day I was at one of the display Macs backing up work files when the sister walks by me, waiting for her to return. On her way back she walks up behind me and stands there, tapping her fingernails on the back of my chair. 

""What are you doing?"" 

I didn't answer

""WHAT are you DOING?!"" 

This time I turned my head towards her slightly and said softly ""What?"" knowing she would lose it.

""I SAID WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? TELL ME *RIGHT* NOW!"" 

At this point all of the customers and sales people in the store stop what they are doing and are staring at her. After a few seconds

I didn't even have to turn around to know that her face was now beet-red and she was furious...

""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY TO ME?!?!""

Several people busted out laughing, whipped around and fast-walked to her office and slammed the door so hard that she knocked something off one of the shelves in her room which shattered when it hit the floor. We all heard a muffled ""FUCK!@#$"" right after that and everyone started laughing again. Owned.

 Most of the clients were impoverished elderly, engineers who'd had their own firms, ex-Vogue models and the like.

Anyway, and he begrudgingly sat down and started to give me the details. Then...he started to rant. And rant. Not a big, ugly rant that could get him thrown out for being crazy, but a conversational rant...about immigrants taking jobs, too many refugees from stupid countries, etc. Didn't take a rocket scientist to see that he had found a target for his misplaced rage as he was very closely watching my reaction. I remained professional and directed the conversation as much as I could, then terminated.

**This next paragraph isn't important

We have a bunch of chickens, because we had a couple hundred at the time and there were only 2 or 3 that came over). Apparently, she thought we stole them so she came over (trespassing) and caught them and brought them back to her house, but they kept coming back over to our yard. So she accused us of stealing them, which was preposterous, since we didn't want them (we show our birds, and hers were just some mixes that were worthless

Another time, and didn't have a backdrop or anything to stop the bullets. My sister was outside, and she said she heard popping by her, which turned out the be the bullets pinging off rocks, so she eventually put 2 and 2 together, and GTFO'd. She's amazingly lucky she didn't get hit, later we looked where she was sitting and there were marks on rocks ~10 ft from her, but told her if it happened again they'd call the cops which I'm assuming would end up with some pretty hefty charges

**On to the actual story...**

It started with her deciding that she wanted some paths back in the woods behind our houses so she could ride her 4 wheeler back there. So she hired a landscaping company to come out and take out a bunch of trees and bulldoze a path back there for her. Despite having the property line marked, riding her 4 wheeler right on the property line whenever she heard us outside, but we barely noticed. Then she upped the ante. We started hearing her radio blaring all the time, including all night long. This actually bothered us, since we usually leave our windows open at night. We called the cops a couple weeks after the start of this, but they said they couldn't do anything about it during the day and we would have to call back at night when the noise ordinances were in effect, but that was more hassle than my parent's wanted since they had to work early and didn't want to spend several hours on a work night dealing with that. Then one day I was back in the woods cutting up some trees that had fallen in a storm, 6 IIRC and they were decent outdoor speakers

The catalyst for my revenge came about a week later. Our phone went out, They said there weren't any outages in the area, so it must be something with our lines. They sent a tech out, he started at the house and couldn't find anything wrong there, so he checked our box out by the road. A couple minutes later, he comes back and asks if we had anyone work on it recently. Nope, nothing of the sort. Then he took me out and showed me what was wrong. Someone had taken some bolt cutters, then closed it back up and put the lock back on so you wouldn't notice unless you took a close look. I had one suspect on the list. 

That night, and my parents had remembered how nice it was to be able to sleep at night without shitty music blaring, so they called the cops up at 2 in the morning and had them make her shut her one-woman revenge party down. 

tl;dr I'm proud of this so read it. You wouldn't be here if you weren't planning on reading a good revenge story anyway.

1368911529.0,1elguj,"Just made things really ""uncomfortable"" for my ""family""",,390,47,49,"To give you some background

When I turned 18/19 years old, then their place once they passed away until we could sell it, and basically handle all the stresses and responsibilities while my mom coddled my younger brother (23 now) and they sat around watching TV all day cause they ""couldn't handle it"".

Even up until recently whenever they needed money for something, a second job, sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say ""oh..thanks"".

Anyways, my brother gets a job. Yay, good for him. He tells me he's planning to move out with his girlfriend in about 6-12 months cause he wants to get out on his own. I have no problem with that, so long as we all have plan. The bills being split 3 ways is fine, but if one of us leaves, it's gonna mess everything up for the other two people, unless we have something set up.

A week later he moves out. Then he denies ever saying any of that. Gets pissed at me because even though I'm happy for him, and cuts me out of his life since ""I don't do shit"" even though I've been taking care of both their asses the last 8 years while he sits in his room all day eating taquitos and playing maplestory.

He also takes his mom's car, and is keeping him on her insurance, even though she doesn't have a car and has to walk to work now. She doesn't even get mad, or try to talk to him, she let's him do whatever cause apparently he's the good kid or whatever.

So now we're in a bit of a crisis because we've got to figure out to cover his 1/3rd of everything. At this point I should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times I was living on my own, plus gave her money to help with her own bills, and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes.

Anyways, applying for jobs online/in person, going to interviews, etc etc. What's my mom doing? Watching TV and smoking e-cigs. I get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer she's given me the last 8 years: she'll sell something, or borrow money from a neighbor. Which NEVER happens. At this point I should also mention she's kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard. Apparently she can't sell the stuff yet (which she's been saying since 2005) because she needs a digital camera. Even though both my girlfriend and I have explained to her HUNDREDS of times that we have cameras on our phones, there's ebay apps. It takes two fucking seconds, but regardless

So I'm driving to work last night and I'm fuming. But I'm looking at everything objectively. Realistically, my mom doesn't care about. ""Oh, our landlord's nice she doesn't mind."" ""Oh there was problems with this place before we moved in, so it's okay if we're little short."" 

Our rent is due on the 1st. We got an extension to the 5th. Then the 8th. Then the 15th. My mom's planning to pay this month on the 24th! Every month I've always had my share, or my brother's end that the money isn't there.

So I'm looking at this and I'm like: ""there's no fucking way I can do this. Even if I get this month, I already work 7 days a week, I COULD get a 3rd, 4th, 5th job, but then I wouldn't have time to go EMT school. I'd be making just enough to cover EVERYTHING but I wouldn't have any extra money to get myself out and into something better.

And it's at this point I say ""fuck it"". I'm not paying a single penny more. I've got several offers from friends to move in with them for 1/3rd of what I'm paying now

But I'm not a complete asshole, get a cheap car, whatever, get her shit together. She's never really had to figure things out on her own because me, or someone else would always ""fix"" everything.

Here's where my revenge comes in: I'm not on the lease. Years ago, and that she'd handle everything, but I didn't buy it. My brother, however, did.

So I'm not liable for anything. I'm leaving

And I'd offer to help buy getting a u-haul truck to get all their shit out

So now they can both ""fuck off"" and ""deal with it"". 

TL;DR: Lazy mom and coddled younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money. Brother moves out

I was desperate for any job at the time

As you can imagine, minus the credit card pushing. However. There was one assistant manager. Imagine the fakest, most bubbly personality you can. Then add in that she was condescending, but in the *nicest* way possible. Nicest being a relative term if you will.

Now, a good 3 hour drive away. A family member in the area had graciously agreed to let stay with them until my parents sold their house. I informed my manager of when I would be leaving, but for some reason he scheduled me for a shift past that date. I actually did drive all the way back for the shift, and upon working that shift, realized they had put me down for another one past that. 

The shift I drove back for happened to be a closing shift. It also happened that I was the only male closing that particular night, **every** female goes to the women's side of the store to do closing duties, leaving me completely alone to do the entire men's side. Fuck me right?

It wasn't a big store, 'I wish drunksaver wasn't here so we could have *girl* talk.' 'He only has that much done so far? Why is he so slow?' and finally, she sent one of the other females to help me. 'He hasn't even finished fronting all of those jeans, WTF.' I don't know, maybe because I've been working by myself you fucking hatchet gash. I'm pretty pissed, but I keep my mouth shut, do my job

Now, I get a call. From my favorite Asst. Manager. It was a sunday and they were slammed, was I coming in today? 

'No, now you can have all the *girl* talk you want tonight.' Click.

Prior to graduating from my university, many great restaurants just a few blocks away. However, the one downside of living there, was that it was half a block away from a theater. Not a movie theater, live theater. As a result, people would park in the garage and fill it up on nights there are shows. I normally didn't mind, as I payed for a monthly parking permit which guaranteed me a parking spot. There were the occasional nights where people would park very shittily, and prevent others from parking next to them; which usually skewed the numbers to gauge how full the lot was. But

It's also worth mentioning, my testosterone was running at 4x the amount it should have been. It was like I was on steroids.

Story time:

I was driving home from work one Friday, and it all coalesced into a shitstorm of fuck everything.

I lived in the downtown area, but fuck was it annoying to get to. What made it even worse to deal with, was that I had to piss REALLY badly. My-bladder-is-going-to-explode bad.

As I said, sent me in to a realm of pissed off that I have never been to: Apparently a group of fuckwads decided to take up an entire row of parking with their BMW's, each one taking up two spots. Normally the garage accounts for shit parking jobs, but this congested things even more. 

I drive around for 10 minutes, there was absolutely none to be found. As I circled each level, there was a (sur-fucking-prise!) BMW SUV that was going the same way as me, but on the opposite side of the level. It's like we were doing a mating dance. With each level, my testosterone-saturated body grew more and more frustrated.

So, usually fairly nice ones that the owners didn't want anyone to scuff or deal with, which I can respect. However, tonight, it was the same as every level above: every spot filled. I circle and circle, and see my BMW nemesis circling as well until...'Lo! Behold! someone is backing out of their spot. But...my nemesis sees this as well....

The lane that they were pulling out of was shaped like a T, and sheer physics made it so the BMW was going to have to let him pass, and meanwhile, victory would be mine! Or so I thought. The BMW knows they are going to be second. They are going to lose. So, the driver has his wife get out, and STAND IN THE FUCKING SPOT. MY GOD WAS I SO PISSED. I flip them off, knowing I had lost the battle

I talked to the parking attendant, but my mind still plotted revenge on the BMW...

Seeing as BMW's were the cause of all this nonsense

Remember that piss I had to take really badly?

Well, but at the moment, that bottle looked like the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

I go back downstairs, door handles, windows, everything. I got it good and covered.

So this tiny little Japanese woman, told everyone to clean up all the time (we weren't that bad), was a constant pain, complained about everything - music too loud, smoking inside, shoes inside, drinking too much tea (!), she called it. On and on this went

In the space of a month she disrupted a relatively peaceful household

She had left instructions with the other Japanese female in the house to forward her degree certificate to Japan

I happened to be the only person in when it arrived. I steamed open the stiff cardboard envelope, and inserted this picture in the frame. In fairness, I also placed the certificate behind the picture - I'm not a monster! I resealed the package and put it back with the other mail. It was sent to Japan like this.

This lady was a divorced single mom, kicked at the walls, shrieked at the top of her lungs, threw toys on the floor. At first, we tried to ignore it, thinking the kid was trying to adjust to a new living situation. But we learned that the tantrums would occur daily and the mom would just ignore the kid. After a couple weeks, we introduced ourselves and politely let her know that the noises traveled and bothered us. She didn't do anything about it and made it clear that she didn't care if it bothered us. After a few more weeks, but the asshole tenant refused to use the rugs. 

This tenant began to try to cause problems for us

We continued to have to live like this. Constantly being woken up at 6:30 am to a kid running around the apartment and having tantrums, and yell in her unit. It was horrible. Home was no longer home. There wasn't a single room in our apartment that we could relax in to escape the tantrums, running, and stomping. All the other tenants hated her and had problems with her, too. The landlord didn't do anything about it because the tenant was also threatening and making her life hell, as well. 

So our neighbor living next door to us owned a single family residence. That neighbor was working out of state at the time and was also in the process of slowly relocating out of state. She was rarely home. One night, and decided to just park in our neighbor's driveway - without asking. She simply decided that because that driveway was free, she was going to park there rather than park a block away - that's the kind of entitled crappy attitude she had.

I put the tires in the trunk and went back to the office area. I stood in line for a few minutes looked down at my hands and they were very dirty from loading the wheels. I said to ""Kenny"" over the few people that were in front of me that I would be back in a few as I was going to wash my hands. ""No problem"" he said. 

When I returned from washing this older guy (60's) was coming in and basically cut me off to get in front of me. Who cares. I never thought any more of it.

This guy was one of the most stuck-up and arrogant assholes I have seen. Now I was a huge proponent of Free Software and such, and all kinds of stuff. Chris and I mostly just ignored him because we were trying to work. But ignoring him didn't help. He would constantly ask us what we were working on and sometimes just to be polite we would tell him. He would immediately pooh-pooh what we were doing and talk about how what we were doing was so ""1970's"" (I still don't know what that meant) and how he had made better software when he was in high school. We would just roll our eyes and go back to work. Once I called him out on his coding skills and asked him to show us his ""amazing software accomplishments"". He said something about how he didn't have the disk on him or some crap and then wandered away. 

I was in my sophomore year and working towards getting a Computer Engineering degree. I also *loved* to write code and so frequently wrote code for fun. I was pretty confident in what I knew, wasn't even a CS or a CSE major. Yet he would keep talking about all this crap he did and how he was an amazing programmer. I once also called him out when he claimed that we weren't real programmers because we didn't know assembly programming (I had *just* finished an assembly-programming class the previous semester). So I started asking him simple questions about basic assembly-programming. He was taken aback and started stuttering because he was bullshitting about knowing assembly and didn't except to be called out on it. Chris and I just laughed at him. He glowered at us and then went away.

As the weeks went by, he proceeded to install all kinds of obnoxious crap that slowed the computer down to such a degree that it made development absolutely impossible. He installed SETI@Home, Folding@Home, and a bunch of other crap. Initially we just thought it was slow, but one time I got it and it was so unusable that I went through and tried to see what was going on. That's when I discovered all the crap that Michael had installed. Michael's favorite thing on that machine was the Mozilla suite (i.e, the browser and everything that came with it. This was in the early 2000's so FireFox wasn't even out). All of our development was in IE and the only reason Michael used Mozilla was because ""Microsoft is evil and I don't want to support them."" Never mind the fact that *he was still using a Windows machine*. I mean, I hated IE as well

Anyway

So using my l33t hax0r skillz

For the first day or two we didn't hear anything; I think he just assumed that one us was deleting his software. Then I think he noticed that he had to reinstall his stuff *every* time. So he started sending out emails (I am paraphrasing these):

First email:

&gt; Why is my software getting uninstalled? 

Second email:

&gt; I am noticing that my software is getting uninstalled. Is this a new department policy?

Last email:

&gt; Whoever keeps uninstalling Mozilla and my other software

He sent these emails out to the entire department. Of course

Eventually he installed something called ""Startup Cop"" and figured out that ""KeyAccessServer32"" was deleting his files. So he then asked me what that was. I lied and said that ""It is probably something the university put in place. They are getting pretty strict about unauthorized and pirated software so I wouldn't touch it."" He grumbled something about suppressing free speech and free software or something and went back to his work.

I married my ""high school sweatheart"".  I met my wife when I was 15 years old and was instantly enthralled. Fast forward through the boring parts (losing our virginity to each other, blah blah blah) and we decided to get married when I was 21.  

I felt that I was mature for 21; I'd graduated from community college while holding down a full time job, she was busy spending the money I earned and partying with her girlfriends.  We'd fight because we didn't spend enough time together then we'd fight because we didn't have enough money (I stopped working so much in order to spend more time with her).  

I managed to find a balance and we were spending more time together.  I frequently attended concerts and had always gone with my friends as she disliked my music (she was also 5' tall and didn't like to be on the floor).  My favorite band was playing a show soon and she said that she would like to come.  I reluctantly purchased 4 tickets on the mezzanine so she could enjoy herself.  She called me after work that day and said she wasn't feeling well and didn't want to come, she said she understood and it was what she wanted.  I said goodbye, kissed her and headed to her brother's house (one of my closest friends). 

After discussing matters with him, that her parents gave us, and that she had given me.  I was as fair as I possibly could be.  Unfortunately for her, I worked a real job, made real money, and spent that money on real stuff. She worked a $9hr 30 hour a week retail job and spent her money on shit.  The house was pretty much empty with the exception of her clothes, one bedroom full of furniture, the washer, ""How am I supposed to cover the deposits?"" she screamed (never mind the fact we that I was obviously moving forward with the divorce

She called me when she got home to scream about her missing stuff.  I informed her that I was exiting her life like she requested.  I reminded her about the utilities and she yelled at me some more.  The following day the utilities were all turned off (it was November
We had a great relationship (still do 7 years later) and he said not to worry that he knew his daughter and he empathized with me.  I had a great deal of respect for this man and knew that he would ultimately back his daughter

**Background:**

About four years ago

The plan was to move back to the hometown

The hometown has no public transit

She gets a job at a coffeeshop

**The transgression:**

Then one day, let her experiment, but in the end, I can't do it. She says it's ok. Two months later, she dumps me for some bullshit reason and immediately starts dating a girl off of OK Cupid.

When she dumped me, not only has she not moved out, she hasn't even tried to look for a place. ""I just don't have money to pay for rent."" maybeyoubuytoomanyfuckingshoes.html

Another month goes by. We fight. I tell her to get her shit and go. I'm throwing her out. ""You can't throw me out! This ain't your house! Your grandma has to throw me out!"" Fine

Talk to my grandmother. Explain the situation. Can she please tell the ex-gf to leave? ""Well

**The complication**

So time goes by. She becomes such a lesbian that she starts a long term relationship with a GUY she used to work with. At the same time

And by ""help, I'm kind of stuck with the bitch.

And lest you think that she ain't so bad because she helps out, and has a habit of being at her bf's for days at a time while I am constantly on the clock being a caregiver. She then has the audacity to be upset if I go out for a few hours. jimmierustled.pdf

So starting about 14 months ago, tortilla chips, cupcakes, etc. and leaving them around the house. She has an insatiable sweet tooth and absolutely no ability to resist sugary deliciousness. I also start buying 12-packs of the heavy, darker beers with the highest calorie counts. Leinenkugel Berry Weiss (207 cal per bottle), Duck Rabbit Baltic Porter (270 cal), etc. Since she never met something alcoholic she didn't like,"" is what I get instead of an apology. allpartofmymasterplan.ogg

So here we are, are now sad and droopy when she's not wearing a bra. Her arms are gaining thickness, and her ass has expanded some. Her BMI has jumped from Normal to Overweight and I don't think she has too far to go until she reaches that most coveted stays: Obese. 

The best part about this petty revenge is that it is insanely easy to pull off. I wonder how her boyfriend feels seeing his girl constantly expanding?

Why this course wasn't a club beats the hell out of me, if it's the first time caddying for that person, you're always nice. If he tips well, you make a concerted effort to have him again. If he doesn't, fuck that guy. This worked brilliantly up until this one old man, and we'll just call him Frank. Frank tipped me awfully and was an all around bitter dude my first time around with him. He's the type of guy that asks for your advice just so he can go about doing the exact opposite of what you say on purpose, only to finish by slamming his club down and blaming you for how much dick he sucks at the sport. Along with watching people butcher a game that should be relaxing and fun for six hours a day without swinging a club, as you'll see.

As luck would have it, for a round of weekend golf. He books the first tee-time of the day at 5:45 AM on Sunday because if he went to church he'd spontaneously combust, and he probably did it on purpose because he's a dick. However, I see it as an opportunity to pick up a second loop after and make double money. Two loops should bring in very close to a couple hundred bucks, and I'm alright with that. Cue the rain. It fucking rains for sixteen holes and he refuses to go inside, he just keeps playing through it with his friends, not really thinking twice about how much his watered down golf bag weighs on me and how miserable I must be. I'd done this before, at this point, I know him. He doesn't fucking care. A marshal comes by and forces him to head in. This is where my day really starts to suck.

I convene downstairs with other unlucky caddies in the cart barn, and go they home. Hours pass, it's down to a few of us left in the barn, our groups have clearly forgotten that we exist/take pleasure in knowing that we are having a terrible time. The idea of a second loop is long gone when 6PM rolls around, and groups are cleared to play. Frank comes down personally to get me, ignoring the ""employees only"" sign because he is at this point hammered drunk, and takes me out again to stumble through his last hole of golf. Fifteen minutes later, I make 40 bucks for the DAY. Not even joking, and I tell them that ""You play golf

Two days before I'm done here, but being a golfer myself, I decide not to write the wrong score on his scorecard. I do the honest thing and I write down what he actually scores. This is fun. Frank starts asking questions that he should know but his old, senile mind forgets. ""How far to the water?"" (Not far, you can carry it) ""Does the red marker mean 100 yards out?"" (No, 200) ""What club should I hit here, boy?"" (Well, so I'd suggest taking your driver and killing me with it) ""What way does the green slope?"" (Yes). This continues at an unbelievable rate.

And then...ugh. The girls.

I could tell they were dumb, all blonde, came with three full bottles of red wine (oh boy). They sat down next to a guy and a girl (both of whom were drunk already), and proceeded to have THE LOUDEST GODDAMN CONVERSATION I have ever heard. I can't give details of their conversation, because quite frankly I was trying (unsuccessfully) to ignore them. They sat down at ~6:45. Mumford and Sons came on at about 9. I did not hear ONE MINUTE of silence. One minute. 

The guy next to me tried to ask them to please be quiet

What I've neglected to mention so far is that I had a pretty brutal cold/cough

I noticed that when they go to get more wine (they were selling full bottles there, they just leave them half-full, get another bottle, and then fill them back up. So, when they all left (I don't know why they ALL had to leave, but quite frankly I don't care I was just glad for the break), I sprung into action.

I pulled out a stick of gum, I dropped it into one of their cups. Luckily, it was red wine so you couldn't see into the cup. I popped another piece in. Piece by piece, I filled all their cups with my sickness and spite. Mostly sickness. When I was done, my jaw hurt like hell but my revenge was complete.

She *needs* to sit down in this 5 minutes, when we get to the stop, she *needs* to be the first one off the bus for some reason, so she shoves her way back through the crowd to get to the front of the doors. Never once have i heard the words ""sorry"" (and this is Canada ffs) or ""excuse me"".  

Once off the bus, and then she fucking STANDS instead of climbing the stairs.  Its mind boggling.. is this bitch in a rush or not?  General etiquette here says standers move to one side of the escalator and walkers get the other, most of the time she abides by this, so that's fine. 

Now the train I take is the same one as her also, I get to the train first, and there's lineups everywhere. 

I'll be standing a foot away from the train tracks, and its daily, and habitual.  If not me, I often notice her doing it to others. 

This morning, her foot pulls up, and boom, broken sandal.  I did not apologize.  I feel fantastic about it.

I had a great job working at a restaurant in an amusement park.  The people I worked with were fun, and free passes for me and friends and family.  It was an awesome job for a teenager.  Until the boss's daughter started working with us.

We knew we were in for trouble when our supervisor stopped by to tell us we were getting a new employee the next day and made a point of explaining who her daddy was.  We were warned to be on our best behavior and to treat her well.  It seemed a silly thing to say since we were all friendly and got along so well

This overprivileged, she got into a routine of showing up 20 minutes late and then standing by the soda dispenser for her entire shift and line up the white lines on the [wax Coca-Cola cups](https://www.google.com/search?q=wax+coke+cups&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lyoLUd7vIozuigLVr4CIBw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=900#biv=i|2;d|SUdoiw_1JIILuM:).  We complained to our supervisor that she wasn't doing any work, but he shrugged it off by saying we had plenty of people to do the work and to continue to be polite to her.  Now to be honest, she was an *extra* person on the shift and we had the exact same workload as before.  It was still annoying as hell having someone standing around doing nothing and getting a bigger paycheck.  This restaurant was by far the best place in the park for someone under 18 to work, so we could choose to tolerate Her Majesty and her snide comments or move to a tiny unairconditioned concession stand in 100°F^+ weather.  We begrudgingly chose to play nice.

I opened one morning with another coworker and after we finished setting up, this really is kinda fun.  Let's do Her Majesty's work for her.""  So I started twisting the cups and lining up all the white swooshes too.  Another coworker joined in, and in minutes we'd lined up every single Coke cup on the front counter.  

Her Majesty showed up late as always and dilly dallied around before taking up her usual spot at the soda dispenser.  She grabbed her first stack of cups for the day and looked confused when she saw they were already lined up.  And when she finally realized that *all* the cups - several *hundred* of them - were lined up

**TL;DR  Coke and white lines shouldn't be done at work.**

At our location, which is a straight shot back to the interstate but where there are also a lot of pedestrians. Or they could drive away from our restaurant, perpendicular to the mall, and then get on a curvy road that takes a little bit longer to get back to the traffic light. Naturally, most people took the straight-shot and we always had assholes who just didn't care about pedestrians so they'd floor it in their sports cars and race out to the exit. Every time we returned the cars to certain people, we'd ask them politely not to speed *because they could murder someone* but the chronic-douches never cared or listened.

Well, raised-up speed bumps put in at all the entrances to the mall, including our location. We were told to remind our cherished speeders of the new speedbump/walkways but I ""forgot"" and one night I watched with absolute delight as one smug prick floored it, then locked down his brakes once he saw the speedbumps, hit them at full-speed because it had rained recently and his car squalled tires trying to brake.

This motherfucker did not.

More context is necessary, find seat, get bag into overhead, get in seat, buckle in.  Five step process.  Simple.  Barring the occasional Baggage Bin Tango - the ritual dance of the airline passenger when the carry-on does not initially slide into its place - everything is going perfectly smoothly.

Enter motherfucker.

Older Indian gentleman, already wailing and screaming at decibels not heard since Nagasaki.  Usually, young children by their lonesome have the power to turn a quiet, not unpleasant journey into hours of abject misery.  And while I'm all for kids striving to reach their vast potential at such a young age, such things are not conducive to the rest of the flying people.  To be totally fair, a lot of kids are flying for the first time, and it legitimately can be a scary experience.  For that reason, I'd have been happy to let it go had she stopped.  She didn't.  What sort of training or freak accident she went through to get the lung capacity of a blue whale eludes me to this day.

But with her parents - proof positive that walruses are people too - I have no sympathy.  Right off the bat they're both making their comrades-in-flight miserable, he hoists his Oh-my-God-this-man-calls-that-a-carry-on-bag behind his head and forcefully tries to shove it into the thing while his wife glares at me for not letting her through to her seat (protip: likely because your dipshit of a husband is making himself busy trying to prove the physical application of non-Euclidean geometry [optimistically]).  After being told point-blank that his efforts were in vain and having to be led towards the front of the aircraft to find an available bin and getting into his seat beside me, I thank God above that I'm on the aisle and we take off.

I thank God that I'm on the aisle for two reasons.  One, loudly complaining that the in-flight entertainment was broken.  With no real desire to do any of the flight's options, I unpack the pillow and unfold the blanket, undoing my seat buckle on the sly underneath.  One of the few points of pride I truly hold is that, despite my tall frame, I've managed to make sleeping in economy work with some degree of genuine comfort.

Nope.  Motherfucker was having none of that.

The caveat to this honed skill is that you need a seatmate who isn't a complete armrest hog (if we ever draft a set of commandments for flying, this guy's bony-ass elbow is digging either into my side or into my back.  My one true saving grace denied me, I grumble as the in-flight is turned on and decide to watch some Big Bang Theory to take my mind off of the next several hours.

Toddler once again begins to shriek.  A woman in the row ahead of us, she tells her in no uncertain terms to get fucked, cursing her out even as the woman's polite smile fades and she turns around.  Going back to my BBT, I realize something's caught my eye.

A personal space issue, hasn't it?  You can't even hear what they're saying.  And the only thing preventing you from watching it your own damn self at your own damn pace is your own damn laziness.

He gets up to go to the bathroom several times in the space of the next hour, is running around the cabin like the child of the corn we all knew her to be.  Chalking it up to age-related bowel problems (realistically) or food poisoning (hopefully), I pay it no mind, still trying to tune out their adorable little banshee as she sings what I can only assume is some Indian commercial jingle.  But then, Gramps decides he needs to sleep.

And my shoulder gets the honor of being his pillow.

No.

*Hell* fucking no.

**---THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR---**

I sit there, the woman falls into her slumber and begins to snore, her sugar-crashing hellbeast of a daughter following suit.

I watched them board.  I knew that the old man was clutching both his passport and his boarding pass.  I knew that he had slid them into the front seat pocket (a tactic I use often enough myself to save time flying to the USA, my hand slides along the rough-spun backing of the seat as I slowly maneuver through the pocket and find the now-familiar paper of the boarding pass.  I knew, also, that the immigration forms had already been passed out.  I stand and go to the back of the cabin, asking to borrow a pen.  I acquire the instrument of my revenge and, still working in the shadows, write four S's onto the man's boarding pass before encapsulating it all in a hastily-drawn oval.  A quick loud burst of inhalation from the wretch next to me throws me off my guard for a fraction of a second.  No time to fuck around.

The boarding pass finds its way home

When the plane lands and comes to a full stop, my reaction propelled by my fervent need to get away from this man.  He takes the opportunity to step in front of me for no real reason other than to just get that much farther ahead in line.  A petty offense, but a minor one.  When the line is allowed to move forward, he stops and takes his sweet time to pull his bag out of the overhead bin a good ten rows down, holding up everyone behind him to the point that some cut across the seat rows and move through that way.  Ordinarily I'd have done the same; it's a personal peeve of mine to be stuck behind slow-moving people solely by their own inconsiderate, obstinate nature.

But not today.  I must watch my work bear fruit.

We get in line at Customs.  Being a US citizen, passports and boarding passes being inspected one by one.  As they leave, I see the gate agent reaching for and speaking into his walkie-talkie.

*Goooooood...*

Just before he can enter the corridor into the concourse, who nods, and they both open a door going into the hallway wall, indicating for him to step inside.  Many who pass through the gates in American airports are greeted with open arms, and initiated into their American journey with the welcoming ritual called the ""Freedom Fondle"".

This man's greeting will be worse.  Much worse.

I have a roommate that I've been living with for a couple of years, and she will always be the person who started the fight but never apologized for it.  Part of this is her passing off the stress on her OCD (she actually did get that diagnosed) and part of it is her inability to admit that she was ever in the wrong.  She can also be pretty passive aggressive and makes a number of rude comments to me on a pretty regular basis.  I like her overall and didn't want to go off on her, so I came up with sweet revenge that wouldn't make her go off.

Last year, on the other hand, usually get home around 3:30ish.  You can probably see where this is going.

Because I usually get home much earlier than her, and I'd sit on the couch for hours at a time with her in my lap, taking a nap.  I never rough-housed with her because she's an older animal, and she loves having my fingernails scratch under her chin.  After a few months, I clearly became the cat's favorite.

So now, only for the cat to bolt out of her arms and onto my lap.  The best part is that I usually try to hand the cat back or encourage the roommate to give her treats, all to no avail.  She seriously thinks the cat likes me better for no apparent reason.

**Preface**

My family is conservative, but I'll let you think it. My mom has two sisters that have families, also all the same religion.

Well, and (gasp) has sex.

She lives this way for a great while, so none of us were surprised, though I will admit my parents were pissed. But okay, 5 years, we get it. She's different than the 'norm' for the family.


**Story**

Well, briefly, but come to terms. She's a daughter/sister, and it's weird, but she's cool. Family bond. Nice. She has my nephew. Great kid.

Well, my sister gets a letter in the mail from our Aunt and her family. I can't quote directly but my sister summed it up as follows:

Dear Thebumm's Sister

We've prayed a lot. We care about you and your son. So much. God does too. He wants us to adopt him. Also, so this would be a stable environment you could not provide. He was born out of sin, but that's not *his* fault, and we can see to it he won't suffer for your sins. And you'd still be in his family. God says this is best. We know, because we prayed.

Keep in mind my parents had discussed with my sister all her options


**Petty Revenge**

My sister tells us this, lockout the Aunt and family. No facebook, no phone calls, no contact. Unfriending, deleting contacts.

I sat next to a friend of mine who had slightly more more clout with the bullies than I did so they didn't usually bother me too much

Unfortunately for him

I overheard a conversation one day between my Vice Principal and a teacher where the VP was talking about how he'd come along way in his behavior.  They were in the front of the room while my class was taking a test and they didn't know that could hear them.  Granted, there had recently been a major meeting between his parents, teachers, the district psychologist, and a few other important things.  A lot of stuff about he and his parents were told in no uncertain terms that he was on his last chance, but that he'd seemed to finally get the message and was changing.  Apparently, no one realized that I was still a target of abuse on a daily basis.

I made a plan and put it into motion.  I waited until a day that the aforementioned VP was on-call after school (our bus came back to school often enough I figured out the rotation).  Once the bus got moving, calling me various names, I told him to stop or he'd regret it.  He called me some more names and started laughing.  I turned and spit on him, hitting him right in the face.  I then closed my book and waited.  After about 2-3 seconds of shock that I stood up to him, he starts screaming at me at the top of his lungs (use your imagination), jumps me, and punches me in the face a few times- hard.  He starts screaming about how he's going to kill me and if I ever do it again he'll break my jaw.

He calms down and gets off me after a few good punches.  Bus driver stops the bus, for the first time ever, is *silent*.  He's not touching me but staring daggers.  We get back to school.  The VP who had previously been so impressed by him is waiting arms crossed and face blank.  With her are four cops- town police, not school district police.  The police take him and me off.  They send me away with the VP, one of the cops coming with us.  As I leave I see the remaining cops cuffing David.  I go into the VP's office alone with her and she asks me what happened.  I told her *everything*- I was writing something, he was doing this and that to me, I spit on him, talking about how he rapes teachers who give him bad grades

Turned out that Dave got suspended for two weeks.  That was long enough to get to the next school board meeting where they approved his expulsion.  The last time I ever saw him he was when he was being cuffed.  I have no idea what happened to him after this

One fateful morning, not been able to eat during recess. We'll call him Don. Don had a ravenous appetite which usually spurred him on to performing dares and stunts in exchange for cash and/or food. Jumping off the school's roof, sneaking away on field trips, that sort of thing.

But I digress.

It's after recess

Just as the teacher walked in.

Said teacher didn't take too kindly to eating in class

Disgruntled, class, the universe and time march inexorably forward.

Some unknown time later, it was maths, we didn't care. What we *did* care about was the large, moist, delicious looking muffin sitting on a plate held in the teacher's left hand. Surely not! What about the cardinal rule?

But yes. Out come the books, my word, yes. How dare he use the old ""Do as I say, not as I do"" like on us?

More time

It's here that I should probably point out that our desks were arranged in pairs. And Don was sitting right next to.... we'll call him Barney. We file in from recess

Don pulls out his books. Barney pulls out his books.

Don pulls out two plates. Two forks. A knife. Barney pulls out two glasses.

Don pulls out a cheesecake and proceeds to slice and serve it to himself and Barney. Barney pulls out a bottle of Coke and proceeds to pour two glasses.

This was in 2001. There was a hate site called Dalitstan.org that was all about hating Hindus and India. I forget how I came across the site

I initially started making troll accounts to spam the board. They would just ban the accounts and I'd create new ones. This was starting to get tiring. Seeing as I was a computer engineering major, I simply wrote a script that submitted the form from the same user over and over again. They banned that user and I'd create another one. It was a little annoying for them, but they seemed to react quickly to ban the bot.

Then I took some time to do it right. The board's user-registration form had no protection as well. So I wrote a script that would randomly generate a username, it would register another random username and so on. Once I finished, it was around 10 or 11pm. I started up multiple instances of this script and let them go to town.

I woke up next morning to find over 10, I could tell that they simply couldn't keep up with the bots. Every time they banned one bot, another one would appear. They ended up blocking all posts on the site and slowly set up on the task of deleting the spam posts. I think it took them a month. During that time, I made no effort to spam them again. After they cleaned up the spam, they opened the boards up again. For a week or two I didn't spam and I think they thought they were in the clear. Then BAM! I started it up again. This time, I started large number of instances of the script and let it go to work.

We were all pretty lazy, we wouldn't drink Natasha's Bud Light, and neither of them were to use my bathroom. We had two, but because the other girls took the larger bedrooms and mine was a glorified closet, I got my own bathroom. Totally fair.

Things only got worse when we finally started to set up 10mins before the guests were to arrive. My sister had borrowed a friend's MacBook and of course the room we had booked with a projector at this pub didn't have the appropriate connection for a MacBook. 

So luckily there was a relatively big shopping centre around the corner so I power walked there to look for an adapter. Outside the shopping centre at the back are some basketball courts and a big ramp that shoppers can use to walk from the ground floor

I quickly examined it, and I was aware that I had just waltzed under a bridge encrusted with lowlife teenagers with nothing to do with their lives. Without looking up after having put two and two together, I swung around the base of the ramp and started walking up it. I saw the perpetrator, leaning over the bannister snickering to himself, my eyes grazed across the other teenagers and I saw that they were laughing too. As I passed this kid, I was so angry at the time from conflicting feelings of grief for the loss of my father, frustration at my sister's incompetence and now fury as a result of a dumb kid who had picked the wrong day to send a golly my way. 

I paused at this moment in time and let him go. I just kept walking, it start to rain very lightly. The base of the ramp was approaching and I saw that the kid who was spitting on people, not just me, was still standing there.

But then as karma would have it, but I do have the ability to give myself chronic nosebleeds whenever I require them as a result of an inflamed blood vessel at the back of my nose which several operations have failed to completely fix. 

So I tap the side of my nose firmly in the exact spot I know will make it gush blood. (I've been having nosebleeds my entire life so I know them better than I know my own menstrual cycle). So sure enough, timing it just right. The blood sure enough upsets my stomach and I projective vomit a small amount of bile, blood and spit all over this kid's head. 

The whole ordeal was down so subtlety that nearby shoppers rushed to my aid

I was late to the wake, I didn't get a drop of unsavoury liquid on my clothes, I was sweaty from the adrenaline but for the first time that day, I was ecstatic.

The second time she pissed me off was when I was taking a shower. Perhaps she knew it was me that moved the chicken bones back to her door and wanted some revenge, but then I saw Jennie's shadow outside my shower curtain.  Before I could do or say anything, she pulled my robe off the curtain rod, threw it into a puddle of water on the other side of the showers, and then ran off trying to stifle a laugh. Now I had to go back to my room in a cold, wet robe. Fuck that. Time for some petty revenge. 

Later the next night, she'd leave it out all the goddam time.  I took her shower basket, quickly walked into the bathroom, and threw it out the window. Being on the fifth floor, it landed with the most satisfying crash of broken plastic and burst shampoo bottles I could have asked for (I did make sure no one was below first; we didn't need any other casualties).

My revenge against Jose having gone so well

_

Now, and then nice stuff for everyday use. If you burn something onto the bottom of one of my junky pans I really don't care. Hell, if you burn something in a nice pan it's fine as long as you scrape the burnt stuff off. But Jose...well he just didn't get it. He'd grab whatever pan was handy, burn the crap out of something, then just leave it on the stove until he needed to use it again, at which point he'd add another layer of burnt crap to it until eventually I'd get fed up with it and clean/scrape it myself. This got old fast, and finally came to a head when he scratched up my favorite non-stick pan and put most of my nice cooking knives through the dishwasher. The handles survived but he bent the tips on a few of them and it took me the better part of an afternoon to repair them. I was, really pissed. I had been planning to stop after the hot sauce shot incident but the afternoon spent heating and flattening and sharpening my knives changed my mind. It was time for hot sauce.

While he was in class I went into the kitchen and got to work.

I took out every pot, bowl, mug, and glass that I had, and set them on the table. Using a paper towel I wiped the inside of each one with a little hot sauce and then left them to dry. With the crappy lighting in our kitchen and living room they didn't look any different, however if you put anything in them it would come out with quite a kick.  The residue was a little sticky though so for the outsides I cut open a leftover habanero pepper and rubbed it all over the places where Jose was likely to touch them. Outsides of glasses, pan handles, etc. I finished up by rubbing the pepper on the handles of all the cabinets and drawers

_

For those of you who've never cooked with hot peppers before, which will burn like a motherfucker if you have any cuts or scratches or if you rub your eye or nose, or if you touch your lips.



As a side note

_

I was studying for a test at the time so I was home all evening to listen as Jose spent a good hour and a half screaming, shouting, and eventually whimpering his way around the kitchen trying to make himself something to eat for dinner. Eventually he gave up after finding that everything he touched would make the broken skin around his chewed fingernails burn. 

He went to the dining hall. 

When he came back his eyes were still red from being rubbed with his capsaicin-covered hands

Oh no you don't. Know what happens when you add vinegar (or any other strong acid) to milk? It curdles very quickly. Know what has a lot of vinegar in it? Hot sauce motherfucker. 

While my original plan had been purely defensive

He lasted a week, Jose 0.

1369834424.0,1f9mf7,(Traffic) Cone Wars,amlerot,338,45,16,"Alas this is not my tale

The backround:
Jack had just moved into a new apartment complex in a residential area on the edge of the downtown area. The complex had its own car park
He chose the street just behind the complex - a small cul-de-sac with terraced houses. There were NO signs relating to parking on the street - which in this country means you can park anywhere you want, it never filled up. Jack works odd shift hours and is liable to arrive and leave for work at any hour day or night depending on the rota that week. Also his wife had just had a baby.

The Cone Wars:
Jack would rotate where he parked due to availability of space. One day he came out to his car to find a note on it saying that he was parked in (house number) 56's space, threats to call the police, have him clamped, towed, ticketed. Generally quite the overeaction - and all nonsense. There was no parking restrictions on this street. My friend, now more irked at this assault first thing in the morning - tried to explain that this space was not reserved and there was plenty of other space on the street if the man needed to park - not 20 ft away in fact. More yelling and threats. Jack told him impolitely where to stuff it and went to work. When he came home from work...he was looking for a space (any space) when he spots them - 2 traffic cones outside number 56 - one of which with a paper sign on it saying ""reserved for number 56"" or something along those lines. Jack could not resist. It was quite late at this point, maybe 2am or so - no one around. He pulled up, he decided to put the cones in his trunk and replace them in the morning. However in his sleep deprived panic to get to work the next day he forgot. He came home that night and...spots 2 traffic cones outside 56 again. Did he take them out in his sleep? No...still there in the trunk. Thus began a repeating pattern - my friend would take the cones to work and more would appear when he got home. He didn't always park outside number 56. So over about 2 weeks he took 6 cones

So the next time he came home

Then he called the local parking authority and said someone was blocking the parking on that road and waited. At the moment he saw them pull up he wandered down to the construction guys and told them he thinks he knows where all their missing cones are. The simultanious arrival of the construction guys and the parking guys made for a hillarious encounter. He never blocked the road again.

During my college days I added to my cash flow by designing websites during my breaks between classes. I would look for companies that didn't have a website then would purchase a domain

My deal was simple

More than a decade later and I still have several clients hosting their sites through me. One of these clients even credited me with helping them secure more than 50% of their sales since that is the percentage that was done oversea's because of the website. 

That same client retired a few years ago and sold his company. Within a few weeks of the new owner coming in I get a call from an IT contractor asking me to give him full control of the domain because he had built a new website. I explained that there was a contract to continue hosting through me and I would be happy to setup an account on my server for him to use for this new website.

That didn't go over very well. The next day I got a call from my client

I didn't hear from him for a few weeks. I assumed he finally understood the arrangement and left it at that. Then bill due date goes by without receiving any money. I called several times unsuccessfully. I managed to speak to the accounting department who explained that the owner hasn't approved it yet.

I waited a couple more weeks then called, it was ownership. 

I explained how the contract worked and how he was obligated to pay me. He said ""well take me to court"". I know full well he was assuming I would give in and let him have it. Fortunately his bully techniques didn't work on me.

I went home and redirected the domain from his mail servers to my own personal mail servers. I then put up a dummy website that had in big letters:

**Dear [Company] Customers

**Due to an impending lawsuit with [company name] this website and associated email addresses will no longer be available. [company name] is more than three months delinquent in their payments and have offered no assurance of being able or willing to pay.**

**For all of your product needs

Within a few hours I was called with a demand to remove the default page and return the site and email to its previous state. 

I offered them a solution: ""pay your damn bill!""

The owner drove to my house and paid me cash. A few weeks later I decided I didn't want to do business with these guys again and came up with a very large number for them to buy out their contract. They reluctantly accepted and paid. That money paid for a new car

One afternoon I returned home and was fortunate to catch someone pulling out of a spot so I parked on the street. We only had one spot and two cars so my wife and I took a street spot whenever we seen one. As I was walking from my car to my apartment I noticed this small rusty POS car attempting to parallel park a few spots behind me. The spot was way to small

I was kind of fascinated he was even going to try and walked a little slower to watch. As he pulled in he rammed the car that was behind him

For those of you who aren't familiar with touch parking

When the guy exited his vehicle I suggested he leave a note to the two car owners whose car he just hit. He denied ever hitting them and ran off to his office. I left a note on both cars and received calls later that night. One explained their car was a POS and didn't care about the extra dent but thanked me anyway. The other sounded angry about the incident but that was the last I heard from them.

A few days later and I had a note on my car and the number looked familiar. I called it and it was the first person whose car I left a note on. They witnessed the same car doing the same thing to my car. I ran down and noticed my plastic bumper was scratched.

The next day I waited for the car to show up and ran outside when he did. I confronted the guy

A couple of weeks went by and another note appeared on my wife's car window this time. Same person as before witnessed the same vehicle hit my wife's car. Again I waited and confronted him again. He denied it all again. The damage was very minor so we didn't think we needed to get the police involved.

Instead

We knew the times this guy arrived for work and the times he left work so we parked down the road about 30 minutes before he was to leave work and walked up to his car and stuck a key in the locks on both sides and in the trunk. We then snapped them off so only a small chunk of the key was in the locks. Enough to stop him from fitting his keys in.

We then went back to our car and waited. He came out and tried his driver side first. Looking confused he tried his passenger side

That was the last time he ever parked on that street. ",,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/15mj2f/perfect_use_for_random_keys/

We never explicitly told them that they're blacklisted from Mercedes loaners for life, animal hair all over the place. I started ""running out of Mercedes loaners"" when she brought back a loaner in horrible condition. She thought that we mysteriously ran out of Mercedes loaner cars due to my incompetence. This infuriated her. She would always ask if there were any extra Mercedes that she could drive, but my answer was always that we ran out of them. Bitch-mode engage.

She never got a Mercedes loaner car anymore, but after hanging up, told me to give her a Honda Accord. Not 5 minutes later, I get a call at my desk. It was HER. She told me that she was coming in that day and that the manager promised her a Mercedes since I was never able to give her one. I said ok and let her think she was getting one.

**Some backstory** I had been up until 4am on Friday morning following the scanner feeds and updates regarding the chase for the Boston marathon bombers, and there's free parking for loading/unloading and deliveries (plus an alleyway right next to the building). There's a parking garage across the street, but unless you have a pass you better be rolling in money because it's $5 just to enter and exit during the first 15 minutes, $20 after that.

**What happened** So I order my pizza around 1pm, on delivery instructions I had written (and this is word for word): *cross streets: main and 9th, the entrance is on 9th st, if I'm not already waiting please send text to 555-555-5555*.

So it's 1:45

A couple minutes later my boss comes up to me, as I don't recall giving any parking instructions. So I get my receipt and show her it doesn't say that, but I understood her situation (she has deliveries after all, and they don't make much) so I'm willing to pay, but I'll be asking her employer for compensation. This doesn't sit well with her. Fortunately my boss comes up and says he can get the front doorman to stamp her ticket so she doesn't have to pay, and I go back to my desk to let the boss take care of it. 

My boss approaches me again, stormed off and yelled that they were never delivering at our building again. I assured him that I'll call her place of work and take care of it.

**The Revenge** Really, knowing that she would still be out on delivery,I called her place of work, and requested to talk to her boss. But instead of being a nasty bitch that she and the boss can later laugh at, I was *super nice*. Really, my boss was looking at me oddly because he didn't see where I was going with this.

I pull my phone (I'll say here, aggressive dangerous driver.  I gave him a description of the truck, what I could see of the driver, and yes the tag number.  It's a vanity plate so easy to catch.

EDIT: To those thinking this wasn't satisfying enough, and all the home cooked meals she had with them. But later after this story, she got cancer. And it's not too good to exact more revenge on someone dealing with this. But her awfulness took its toll. Not a lot of people came out to help her. And that sucks. Be good to people, and when you must deal with hardship, your love will be returned to you through the help of others! She's better now, but going through that alone was the seeds she sowed and reaped unfortunately :(


•So this story takes place when I was about 8 years old. I was in Girl Scouts, I had a group leader who was one if the laziest people I've ever met. She was about 45 years old. She would ""plan"" for us to go in all these cool camping trips, and never follow through. She would get us all excited to go horseback riding, and then cancel. I don't think we did 99% of the stuff we spent hours planning. I'll name her ""Ferret"" because she had two ferrets she would let crawl under her shirt and she would lift it up and show the ferret nestling under her bra in her, ahem, *ample* breasts. It was MESSED UP.


So anyway


 So I went to the far side of the backyard to play on my own. I picked up a leaf and pretended it was an airplane. Yeah, those were the days full of such simple pleasures.


As I was spinning, took an interest in what I was doing. Ferret must have been lazy in training the dog too, because it was VERY aggressive. It ran over to me at full speed and just CLAMPED down on my arm holding the leaf. I screamed in pain and freaked out as this dog started to shake its head to rip at my arm. I kept spinning to try to shake it off my arm. Ferret runs over to me the instant she sees this happening and wrestles the dog from my arm. 


I hold onto my arm, or so help me you will regret it for the rest of your life. If you were my own kid I would spank you so hard and ground you for months. You are a horrible child."" And with that, she stormed away with the dog. I ran to my tent and silently cried my eyes out. I didn't understand what just happened. Now, I can love dogs. I really can. But if you can't control your dog, and it attacks kids, YOU SHOULDN'T OWN ONE. 


So fast forward a few hours to dinner time. Ferret had a very very large cast iron cooking pot. I don't know if pot it the correct word because it was huge. It was used for cooking large amounts of food for large amounts of people. It was Ferrets prized cooking pot. If you don't know about cast iron cookware, and then cook again. The oils and flavors build up in it over the years, and it can make food taste AMAZING. No joke, you should get one and season it if you don't already have one. Great investment. Ferrets pot had been seasoned for decades because it was passed down from her grandmother to her mother to her. The food tasted really amazing because of the seasoning on the pot.


Ferret however tasked me with cleanup duties, and she wanted to punish me for the dog incident.


I was given a small, trying to clean this behemoth of a pot. The light on the porch was low, I was mainly cleaning in moonlight. I was shivering and my arms were shaking from fatigue because it was so hard to lift. The rest of the girls sat on the porch around a small metal stand that could hold a camp fire. And they were under a cover, too. One girl asked Ferret if I needed help and Ferret said ""no, meow_mix8 is fine"". I wasn't allowed dessert until I finished cleaning.


About an hour and a half into cleaning (no joke


""JIMMIES SET TO MAXIMUM RUSTLE. JIMMIES WARP DRIVE: ENGAGE.""

""But cap'n

""Damnit Jim


That was it. Time for some sweet and petty revenge. As she went inside, but I'll tell it anyways. I took the garden hose and filled up my washing bucket to the brim, and hefted the pot inside. I then took the bottle of Dawn soap and poured in about two thirds of the bottle. Which is a ridiculous amount, but the pot was big and I was so angry. I took an S.O.S. pad and went about my malicious work. I scrubbed down every part of that pot and I know every trace of that seasoning was washed away. I scrubbed and soaked and scrubbed some more. I then took it out of the water, for a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes washing the pot. But I was proud of my work, and I had full knowledge of what I had just done because my mom had told me how cast iron pots get their important seasoning. I dried it off and poured the wash bucket out into the flower bed to hide my evidence.


Ferret came out and looked over to where I was. I was walking towards her with a clean pot, I crawled into my tent and shivered myself to sleep in my sleeping bag, laughing silently about how I washed away decades of work.


The next day was uneventful. We got to go home, weird ferret lady. Don't mess with the person in charge of taking care of one of your favorite items. It's not the smartest thing to do.


TL;DR Girl Scout leader's dog attacks me, and I ruin the crap out of it.

This takes place about 4 months after getting revenge in the dorms. I moved into a house with two other girls because they got rid of their terrible roommate and needed a third. They told me about how awful she was

Fruit names worked well before

* Lime- She was rarely home
* Kiwi- One of the most helpless people I have ever met. For this story
* Durian- The girl who had been kicked out and caused problems!

I came home from school and found an eviction notice taped to the door. I assumed it had been a mistake, Durian owed a fair deal of money while she lived there and when she left, she left us with the debt. Landlord obviously wanted his money and so the notice was pinned up.

I was still enjoying my new confidence and decided that I would fix things... somehow. First, or she just refused to answer Lime. Then, I told Lime to call Durian's parents and see if they could help us and they said that there was no way their PERFECT daughter would do such a thing and if we needed to find her, we could find her ourselves.

I got mad. What kind of person knowingly screws three people over? 

I got Lime to call the landlord, maybe it would soften things a little and give us some time. Plus, sad story + crying= maximum sympathy. It worked, landlord gave us some more time.

Kiwi was still crying

That message was sent to everyone on our Facebook friends list. Mine, I had a lot of old dorm-mates that were still on the list. Things got funny when I learned that Durian had dated the now boyfriend of Kiwi. He had a lot of mutual friends with Durian so this worked very well.

Within half an hour

By the time evening rolled around, not because she owed the money, but because various cousins had seen comments on FB saying ""I can't believe you would do something so awful"" and these family members were calling her mother and father and asking questions. Plus, our old dorm mates had all dropped her from their lists and her friends were calling her, asking what had she done?

I coached Lime to not sound angry, first thing in the morning, she would go to the apartment where Durian and her KFC boyfriend were crashing and take her to the landlord. Never letting her out of her sight and taking a cab to the landlord's place so that she couldn't try and run away. This worked, and despite being very unhappy and angry, Durian went to the landlord and admitted that she alone owed the money, she no longer lived at that residence and she signed a document stating she would reimburse the landlord.

I drafted another message for Kiwi's boyfriend to put on Facebook

When everything settled

I don't know what happened to Durian

One day T was even worse than normal. In ""outside playtime"" a few of us were running in circles on the monster truck tyre that laid flat on its side, and she didn't even say sorry. I even said ""T, that wasn't nice and I didn't like it"" as we were taught to, and she still didn't apologize. It wasn't nice and I didn't like it. 

That same day, buttons, etc. that we could use, and it was basically first come first served for anything you found. This time, my friend found a massive, fake, purple jewel right at the very bottom of the bucket. We all ooh-ed and ahh-ed because as far as our little minds were concerned, my friend saved it for the very last thing to glue on so she could get it absolutely perfect. However, when we got back the jewel was nowhere to be found

We asked her where it went

This friend was the kindest person I knew (she would always play the mum in dress ups) and I needed to get T back for being mean to her. We couldn't hit, I was placed at a table with her. This time was for puzzles, reading or writing, and today T and I were practicing the alphabet. 

I was a pretty smart kid, T forgot which way an ""e"" went and as luck would have it, I was the only one who could help. This gave me the opportunity I needed. 

I taught her to write it backwards, the tail on the ""g"" actually went the other way, and that ""v"" was the round one not ""u"".

There were only two redeeming things in my service: one was the fact that I worked with the greatest guys in the armored corps

This shower was a sacred ritual for the field technicians. It was the last few minutes of the day where you'd have a few precious minutes to yourself; where you washed away all the grime, and dust, and tried to get the knots and aches out of our sore muscles. The water was plentiful and hot, the pressure was great, and sometimes that shower was the only good thing about my day.

One time, and just wanted to shower and go straight to bed. But one of the other guys in the platoon, a computer tech, had other plans for me. As I was showering, he turned a hose on me and blasted me with freezing water for a good minute. I yelled at him to stop before I murdered him, but he wouldn't listen! So I started chasing him while ass-naked, and the commotion drew out people from the barracks. I slipped and fell on my ass, and this fucker seemed pleased as a pig in shit. An officer told us to pack it in

So I bided my time. I waited six months for winter, he was near collapse and went to shower late at night. 
Then I knew I had him.

I filled a 20 liter cooler to the brim with ice cubes and water, walked in silently, and POURED THE WHOLE THING ONTO HIS HEAD. For a second, he looked around confused, then let out a huge, mooselike bawl that told the world of his despair better than any words ever could.

The exit to my work is from a major highway (US59).  The exit has an exit-only lane, if anyone wants to know).  That sixth lane, however, is fed from a tollway (and not a surface street) so it's generally pretty full.  Generally speaking, the cars from the fifth lane and sixth lane want to switch places, as people from the highway want to take the exit and people from the tollway want to get on the highway.  Thus, people make room to let the cars in the two lanes switch places

Not today.

When I approached my exit the front of my car in the fifth lane was about halfway along a blue car in the sixth lane.

Domino's revoked that policy in 1993, but the guy won't budge. So I tell Douchefuck his options are simple. Be back at the apartment in five minutes to pay for the pizza or I take it back. He tells me to fuck off, so back to the store I go (after thanking roommate and apologizing of course).

When I get back, employees must bend over and take it like the little bitches that they are. Finally, my manager just apologizes and offers the guy a free pizza. Douchefuck angrily asks how fucking long it will take. My manager looks around the now empty store and calmly answers ""We are pretty swamped, so about three hours,"" and then proceeds to put in a timed order for Douchefuck to go out in three hours.

First, anything but glamorous leading up to my senior year. I was a goth kid. The only goth kid in this school mind you, so I was a constant target for jokes, pranks and other such things. I was even kicked in the head by the punter for the football team during lunch junior year. But, i was taught patience and to just let them do it. They always got in trouble (though not as much as I'd like) and that was that. However, I never forgot anything that was slighted on me. I remembered each little infraction and made note of it.

Now, bending the metal frame of what one douche hoped would be a dune-buggy by the end of the year (we had fabrication and metal shop classes) and other little snips. But it was what DIDN'T happen to me, that illicit the most drastic action I'd ever take against the whole of my senior class.

It happened during our yearly Prom Royalty assembly (sadly I had no way to dodge out because most teachers watched the doors) so I took my usual spot in the top most corner of the senior section of the bleachers. I'm barely paying attention as the bimbos who go for the titles of Prom Queen and Prom Princess (yes we had a runner up slot *gag*) read off their sob stories, just to participate was her goal. So now this whole speech thing has my attention as I watch the girl, with apparent Down Syndrome, come up and give her speech to the school. Her speech is stuttered, but discernible and it makes me smile to see her up there with that amount of courage. She finishes and the school applauds. What happened next is what cause me to see red.

The two bimbos (who would go on to win the top two spots, while I try my best to hold my seething fury in check as the assembly empties out. Once school is let out, I make my way home as fast as possible and pull out a small little chest of ""tools"" from under my bed. Such a horrid display of humanity needed a very special form of payback, and it just so happened they had the Senior Royalty party that night at the school. What better way to get back at them, than to ruin their lovely little dance? Why, with extra strength liquid laxatives!

Fast forward to that night, tacos, lots of greasy foods) and just beginning to discreetly drop the clear liquid laxative juice on the food and in the drink bowls on the tables. 

""Hey, this guy, was as cool as they come. For all the times I'd had detention for fights and the occasional curse word in class, this guy had been the one to help me out during my sentence. He even gave me some band suggestions to try, such as Lordi and Dimmu Borgir. Anyways, I tell him whats up, and what I'm doing. He pauses and I see the brains in his head working. He raises a finger

""Just locked the last set of bathrooms that are open for the dance. No other bathroom is open in the school."" He gives me the ""Rock On"" sign and goes on his way as I finish my devious intentions and scuttle on myself. After about an hour or so, I left for the night. The next day at school, nearly half of the senior class was still gone with bowel issues. Worked better than expected!
