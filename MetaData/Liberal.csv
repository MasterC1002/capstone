I started with conservativism because I was raised fairly conservative and am a Christian. I decided to determine where they stand on several key issues. The way I see the current conservative views are as follows: (foriegn affairs) interventionalist, that didn't cut it for me.

So I went on to look at Libertarians, I was finally able to wrap my mind around the ideas of Libertarianism and they kind of scared the shit out of me. Did you know that they support a system of governance whereby the free-market controls EVERYTHING? Basically, many libertarians are anti-tax, anti-regulation, and believe that the free market and enterprise will be able to effectively regulate itself. Taxes used to build infrastructure are wrong (nay, theft!), taxes used to educate the populace are THEFT!

TL;DR: I now realize that I am a ""crazy Liberal"" because I believe top-down economics doesn't work, infrastructure, etc.) are absolutely necessary to the functioning of a modern economy.

The whole class gasped, laughed, screamed ""WHAT!?""  and two students who thought they were particularly funny literally stood up and began yelling things like, ""you dirty liberal!"" or ""commie!"" This kind of behavior was a regular occurrence everyday. They did not get in trouble for their behavior.

I'm by no means rich, wouldn't the cost of goods and services also go up thereby negating the effect we hoped the raise would make? What good is a raise to 10.80 if the price of mcdonalds goes up? In essence, a raise in the cost of labor would in turn be shifted to the consumer in higher prices. 

Furthermore

and after this raise in the minimum wage

For those of you who ask why liberals tend to shun libertarians

The add itself is straightforward enough, before finally playing soccer in a public park that looks like it hasn't been mowed in months. While definitely hyperbole, it emphasizes the point that without taxes, many things will suffer.

The response was much as you'd expect

&gt;""This is the exact argument for if slaves became free. They need to be slaves otherwise they will just be lazy. Wow.""

As well as:

&gt;""Is that what you believe

And the assumption that government removes all work ethic:

&gt;""The question is one of how powerful a government they will be able to corrupt and use against you. Currently

And here we have:

&gt;""Things get done because people want them done. That demand for action does not disappear just because a government isn't coercing money away from people. If people want roads, then--newsflash--they will voluntarily pay for it! It's not hard to understand.

And of course

I am a Conservative. This is a scary and strange place for me. However

I'm not sure if this already exists but I thought it might be really interesting and productive if we could create a sub-reddit that was for bipartisan solutions. I would imagine it to be a place where the left and the right start with an idea or problem, we could all send it to our leaders. Let me know what you think! and........ugh.......con.....congratulations......you won..... 

Edit: Thanks for the awesome feed back guys. Someone below has created the sub-reddit. Please go check it out and lets get some ideas going. I think the first step would be to pick our starting issue. One that would be fairly easy to compromise on. Any ideas? Put them in the sub-reddit. Thanks!

Private Debt = good; a mechanism by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer

Racism = historical social problem that ended in 1968

Reverse Racism = belief that Racism still exists

Justice = to be defined

Judicial Activism = court decisions they don't like

I think that we have moved from capitalism to corporatism in this country. I do not like it when corporations pay off government officials or work together (like the oil companies do) to screw over the rest of us. Wal-Mart pays their employees so little that Wal-Mart employees collectively get 2.66 billion in food stamps a year. Wal-Mart's profit is over $15 billion. So basically a large percentage of their profit is a government subsidy. Pay your workers more!!! 

After reading what Ben Stein said yesterday on Fox &amp; Friends about taxing the rich leads to a strong middle class

I DON'T like the attacks on Mitt Romney over on r/politics. It has moved from arguing political points to frontpage personal attacks by random bloggers. You guys think that their is so much republican voter fraud and no mention of [democrat voter fraud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT77qP2Nai8&amp;feature=youtu.be). Also the mainstream media seems to be very pro-Obama which freaks me out a little bit. 

So here are my main reasons that I am voting for Mitt Romney. I will try to keep this short and only list the most important ones. 

I believe that both candidates are very pragmatic and really do want to find the best way to move America forward. Both candidates have big corporate sponsors. Both candidates are in the top 1%.

I also think that a candidate will very often say one thing and then do another once in office. You never really know what you're going to get so you have to rely on their past record. 

1. Obama increased the federal debt $4 Trillion. This is the most important reason that I do not want to vote for him. I don't see any changes coming from him in this area. Mitt Romney balanced the budget in Massachusetts
2. The bailouts sucked. It was good to bail out the auto industry because that saved American jobs and they have paid or are paying the debt back but a lot of money went to foreign banks like AIG and companies that went bankrupt. I would have liked to see stipulations placed on the executives of these companies for receiving the money though too. 
3. There is no way Obama can raise taxes on the rich no matter how much he wants too. Congress won't let him. However
4. It is becoming clear that Obama lied about the Benghazi incident presumably to look good. I am guessing this isn't the first time. If you are the president you cannot lie! Stop lying. People say Mitt Romney lies more than anyone. But as far as I can see these lies are contradictions about what he is going to do or what his plan is. Everything that you say that is going to happen in the future is technically a lie b/c you don't know what will happen. Having a plan or changing it is fine but you can't lie about what happened in the past. 
5. It has been over 8% unemployment for almost the entire Obama term. Time to give someone else a chance. Mitt Romney has a plan to create 12 million jobs. I don't know if he can do this or not (I doubt it) but it is like Kennedy saying we are going to get to the moon by the end of the decade. It is a national goal. It is good to have direction. I like this. 
6. Congress is getting nothing done and has the lowest approval rate in history at 13%. Obama's leadership has caused repbulicans and democrats to hate each other. Mitt Romney can work across the aisle better. He got a lot done in Massachusetts even though the legislator was mostly democratic. Obama isn't helping people work together. 

So there you have it. The main reasons I am voting for Mitt Romney are economic because that affects me the most. 

Edit: After reading and responding to many of these (I am not done yet) I have come to one of two conclusions. I have not seen a good enough argument to change my mind or I am not as open minded that I thought. :/ 

Here are the best arguments I have seen against Romney so far:
-His record in Massachusetts actually had  very low job growth
-When he left office his approval rate was 36%
-Most businessmen-presidents have governed the country worse

Yikes. At the end of the day though the debt is still $4 trillion greater when Obama said he would cut it in half. If you could explain what is up with that then that might convince me. However,,False,self,t5_2qxt5,1351362262.0,,True

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld

According to SCOTUSBlog

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent

**Commentary on Commerce Clause

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11

&gt;Footnote 11

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders.

Most recently, and my sister (by far the worst person with whom to start an argument, and whom I avoid doing so with) noticed it and chimed in. We had a discussion. I speculated that it sounded to me like something out of a Dickens book, and that it didn't seem like a good idea, and that imprisoning people for failure to pay small debts would likely cost us more money, even in the short term.

""Put them in prison!"" she shouted at me (The following is of course not exactly what was said, they abuse government aid programs, and they don't even want to better themselves. They don't want to be a part of the system, they just want to abuse it. There are black guys in Detroit who father six kids out of wedlock and don't work at all so they can't pay child support, so they don't have to.""

Never mind that it wasn't quite the points the article was touching upon.

""They need to know that they can't get away with that, either. Their ten illegitimate children won't think it's okay to walk around with their iPhone 5s while their mommy and daddy are living off welfare and food stamps that people who actually contribute to the system have to pay for.""

""I had food stamps

""That's not your money

""I worked and I paid taxes. I still have debt

""No, by the way, so complaints like this about people in Detroit are heard from her daily) have no desire to better themselves at all, and are perfectly content just living off of the system that Obama feels the rest of us need to pay into.""

""Isn't that what those programs are for

""No

""How do you know?""

""They don't. They're lazy and would rather live off the system than put in any amount of hard work to better themselves.""

I could see that our discussion had reached the point where it would basically turn into an infinite loop

How much of a problem is this

These are the types of thoughts they have about a lot of things. I'm an educator, which they all do/are getting), they subscribe to the ideas about businesspeople running schools, even when I bemoan the massive charter corporations who are failing our students by teaching them how to take standardized tests and removing arts programs.

""Well

""That's not the point, except students' ability to take those tests.""

""Well

""Teaching kids useful skills and subjects and having them interested in learning things they want to learn about.""

""No, or supported, I might as well talk to a brick wall.

So, as you can see from the earlier example, they catch that, too). I'm not immune to their consistent pushing their own beliefs on me, though; I can't prevent them from coming to me, or calling me, and saying things like ""Did you hear about...? This is why Obama needs to go!""

This was mostly a rant
