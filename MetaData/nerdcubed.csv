Should we have a Dad³ Channel? 

First thing to say is that this won't take time away from my channel. (I'll still do father and son-days too) It will be gaming videos that my Dad makes entirely by himself. Probably a bit more standard playthroughs then you get on my channel but still comedy in tone.

Just wondering what the interest is in a channel run by a 58 year old? :D

1. The playlist videos are in order how i uploarded them. But i want the latest video as the first one.
http://s1.directupload.net/file/d/3192/3g97pice_png.htm

2. Go on edit playlist.
    On the right side there is a ""Quick sort by"" dropdown menu.
    Choose ""Date"" or ""Reverse""
    Click ""DONE""
    http://s1.directupload.net/file/d/3192/jhftcm9e_png.htm

3. Now the playlist order should be changed on the mainchannelpage.

1357483296.0,16280h,PROCRASTINATORS! THIS IS A CALL TO ATTENTION! ,Mattophobia,103,27,198,"Remember the NerdCubed Minecraft Server that started? Well it's expanding! Here's the plan:

The server will consist of 4-5 worlds:

1 will be the spawn in which there will be 3-4 portals.

3 of those portals will lead to three different worlds. A PVP survival (Mad and unmoderated)

There will be a 4th world for special events and will not always be open.

**NOW** how big this server will be is down to you guys! First of all

By donating £5 (Need to pay the server bills here :p) or more you will get a little flair on the server as well as your name added to the donation board at the spawn. But most importantly you will gain access to the donator only co-op survival which will be a friendly survival world in which you have a house and a job and you only build your house/estate and workplace and such. Dan may or may not play in this world from time to time (Shhh). **Also

The fate of this server is down to you! Pleae leave a comment to say wether you'd play regularly on this server and please donate if you can (It's a dedicated paypal in which all money goes towards the server). If everything goes to plan the server should be up in a couple of weeks.

**The fate of this server is in your hands!**

Donation link: *We're currently not accepting donations. When the website is up we will have a new donation system*

- Mattophobia

P.S. The world from the current server will become a museum on the new server and some builds will be used at the spawn or moved onto creative plots. Some large builds may be moved into the project world. We'll see. :p

P.P.S. This is an Unofficial NerdCubed Server which will be ran by me and SN4T14. Dan will pop on and such

Every Saturday I'll be giving away a Steam copy of a game Dan has done a video on. Wether it be a small game or a AAA game like Far Cry 3. The competition will be open for exactly a week. The winner will then be announced on the post which will be for the next giveaway and so on! I'll be running this every week for the foreseeable future. 

This weeks prize is **Super Hexagon**. Here's the video Dan did on it if you'd don't know/remember: http://youtu.be/iaeK9ZTh_OY - You will also be make ""Player of the Week"" on the Nerd³ Steam Group (If you're a member).

A Few Rules:

1. You will be disqualified if you enter more then once.

2. Everybody who is a subscriber to 'OfficiallyNerdCubed' on YouTube is eligible to enter (Except for me and Dan of course).

3. The winner will be chosen at random using a random number generator. 

Now, if I start to make a profit that money will be spent on more or bigger game to giveaway. **So please, disable AdBlocker before clicking the link**. :p

Link to Enter:

**UPDATE: Please make sure you have Steam Guard turned on as we cannot trade otherwise. If you turn it on then you'll be able to trade 15 days later (Bloody annoying). So make sure it's on if you want your prize!**

That probably just made me look like a fanboy. I never meant to try and offend you in anyway neither do I criticize people by what console they use. Im writing this to say Im sorry that I offended you and I hope that you see it in you that I deserve to be unblocked from following you.

Enter Dan and his videos... I can watch a couple during a lunch break

I'm especially fond of the ones where you go off the pre-designed gameplay loop somewhat, it's great to see you set yourself out of context challenges, like in aerofly FS where you were determined to land :)

4. [The experiment begins today!](https://twitter.com/DanNerdCubed/status/329481185791201280)

I will be very surprised if I'm wrong. 720p videos means he can upload them twice as fast

With the amount of series he has going on at the moment (FGF, InTheLittleCubed, Elite Force) he can only upload one video per series per week. That means it could take him almost a year to complete Elite Force, and those videos are really simple to do - no editing required. BUT, if he started uploading 2 videos every day, it would be a win/win situation - more videos for us, faster series and more ad revenue for him.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/1dh5as/so_is_anyone_else_looking_forward_to_two_videos_a/

First of i would like to thank wot for all the work he has put into the [IRL-channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Officiallynerdcubed) even though we all know that he is going trough a very difficult time right now

**we love you wot

Well now that that is out of the way.
I would like to thank this community, this community has some rotten apples in it).

Next i would like to thank matt, and most of the money payed for this comes from him and he does weekly giveaways where he gives away not so cheap games (again mostly from his own money)

Next up is SN4T14 and for those of you that don't know he created and manages [the bot](http://www.reddit.com/user/nerdcubedbot) and manages the behind-the-scenes of the servers (quite a bit of work for one man).

Now the next one i don't really know so well
You guys keep that place spinning by making sure that we show some manors

Next i would like to thank steve, it works.

Now i think that i have showed every person who deserved it some love (i might have forget someone though).

So now i would like to get back to the reason we are all here, so that one day we can say i knew him before he got big. 

Lastly i just want to say we love you dan

It's competition time! We need a logo for the new Nerdcubed Servers Website. It has to be in the Nerdcubed Cartoony style but look different enough that it won't be confused as official!

You can use whatever imagine program you want

We need a logo icon. It must be a high resolution icon logo to represent the server both on the website

The logo also has to be created by YOU. You cannot use any copyrighted images in your entry. Also keep in mind that this is not just for a Minecraft server. It has to be a general logo that can encompass all the game servers as well as future ones.

The winning entry will be used as the official logo for the servers and a £20 (Or your regional equivalent) Steam Wallet voucher!

The deadline for this competition is Midday (GMT) on Sunday the 7th of April 2013. Please post a imgur link to your image in the comments to enter! If you win you will e contacted for a higher resolution version. :p

- Matt

EDIT - Something I need to make clear is that the logo has to be different from the Nerdcubed logo. A whole new logo! It just needs to fit with the Nerdcubed theme! So please remember this when creating your stuff. It can't just be the Nerdcubed logo with servers stuck to the end of it

EDIT 2 - I obviously haven't been clear enough about the kind of logo that is needed. Something simple, [3](http://api.ning.com/files/Fd0Hyt-VB-mLJyE6xLYZ**QLu2VVQfvnaIEzyxSO11rwdkqRti2q4ra1ES1p8jr1BpSEJSaRTmqdCOv-6CXzMGxmhyl-gUex/applelogo.gif), [4](http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/1d/1d2fc9a4ebc452c3594ca73cc5480908b19b1f38_full.jpg). Simple, elegant and looks good at both a 16x16 resolution as well as 1024x1024, so when designing, please look at it at a small resolution (About the size of the up and downvote buttons) as well as a high resolution, it has to look good in both. It also **Can't look official**. I'm seeing a lot of entires which are simply variants on the Nerdcubed logo, different but still relatable. Clean and simple,self,

1364859856.0,1bh291,Some ideas for the Garry's Mod Fanserver (Warning: Wall of Text),Im_Not_A_Tree,24,2,15,"So
Please excuse this

First

1. DarkRP is hard to moderate.

It's going to take more moderators than what we have to make sure the server is safe from rulebreakers. I'm not sure what system you plan to take for this

2.DarkRP is way too commonly used for servers.

By the time of posting this, (I know they don't but this is for demonstration) we can calculate that all the servers have an average of 7 players on them at all times. If you haven't played DarkRP before, you usually need around 15-25 players on for it to be fun, depending on what you think is fun. Also by the time of posting this, it has 13 players on. Good, but it did just launch. I'm not sure how many will stay when the initial wave of people dies down.

Now then

1. Switch to a different Gamemode.

Sandbox, there are many others. Garry's Mod stranded has 27 Servers and 173 Players right now; Bringing an average of 5 Players per server.
""Wait a minute!"" I hear you saying to your computer screen for some odd reason. ""That's less than DarkRP!"" Yes, Garry's Mod Stranded does not need as many players for it to be fun. It's not a roleplay, and if you don't want it to be, not a team effort. You could happily play on your own for hours on end- or, if you wish, create a tribe with multiple people. Plus,  if we assume that 7 people on the DarkRP server are just random people
It's also quite easy to install, adding the [Garry's Mod Stranded Workshop Item](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133364818) to the collection. Choose the map you wish. For clientside, just subscribe to the [Garry's Mod Stranded Workshop Item](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133364818) and you're done. Cinema has the exact same installation on both Serverside and Clientside; Replacing Garry's Mod Stranded With Cinema. Sandbox requires no installation.
Yes

2. If you wish to stay with DarkRP

Dan just mentioned in a post on here that he's recorded videos for several games in the GTA series that just weren't funny enough. He's recorded them

The unworthy video idea is actually not the main reason I would watch a third channel: the real reason is posting entirely unedited videos. We all know that Dan records a couple hours of footage for each video

I guess the best example of why this might be a good idea at all is Minecraft

So, OpenTTD and soon CS:GO). Our plan is to have a big lineup of gameservers for all you procrastinators to play on!

But here's the problem, users, complaints, suggestions, announcements, service updates, donations (Which will have many tiers with benifts in all games and there will also be a few monthly subscription based donation options for awesome shit).

Now

Why am I telling you all this? Well it's because you're the ones who donated and it's your decision how the money is spent (As it was originally intended just for the Minecraft Server). Buying a vBulliten licence costs £170. We currently have £360 in the Paypal account and we're spending about £110 a month on hosting and such. So if we were to buy it we'd take a big hit. So it'd like to know your opinions on this (Or if you have any better ideas)! I also want to push donations again as we want to get this all set up

The new Nerdcubed Minecraft Fan server is now OPEN! Yaaaay! Because this is a new server there may be problems

The current server has been closed and the world file can be downloaded here: http://www.mediafire.com/?nhqneqw4nnpwjlw

The old world is also on the new server for staff use so we can copy unfinished builds and such. You can request you build be moved by using /helpop on the new server

We also have a custom texture! It's just an art pack. You can download the default texture pack with the new art files here: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4ux6d6xbua5di44 OR you can replace the art file in the texture pack of your choice with our custom one! You can download it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?spa53bssj5p2gak 

The new server IP is mc.nerdcubedservers.co.uk

Make sure you read the rules using /rules

We have also closed the Mumble server! We have upgraded to a 72 slot TeamSpeak 3 server! You can download teamspeak here: http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads

The Teamspeak IP is: ts3.nerdcubedservers.co.uk:20027 - Make sure you include the :20027. I am working on making it so you don't have to add the port. :p

It's been quite a bit of work
