**The information contained in this post is 4 months old, quite happy with my service and the updates made to the UI, stability, and performance of Spotify on Android.**


I finally gave up on Spotify. I've been a paying Premium member for right around 6 months now, lacking what seem like obvious features (with no indication whatsover from Spotify that they are making any progress addressing these issues), and is just generally a headache to use.

So I left. Here's what I left when asked why I'm canceling my subscription:

-------------------

I've been paying $10/month for Spotify Premium - the main sell being the privilege of having Spotify on my mobile phone. Unfortunately

The content it accesses is great, no library sorting options, no gapless playback on local files, service outages unrelated to mobile coverage - the list goes on. These are ongoing too - updates appear to be minor and in 6+ months have yet to fix core flaws with the app.

Don't get me wrong, but my uses are almost exclusively mobile. I feel that the mobile users have been largely ignored, and for $10/month, that's not ok.

I will watch Spotify's progress

---------------------

*Playlist Time

I have no idea how long my playlists are anymore.  I make playlists to be a specific time for specific tasks, but I might have to go to another method now.

*Searching for Songs on Artists' Pages

I also can't use the Ctrl+F search on artists' pages if I want to find a particular song anymore.  Now I have to do it through search.  So much for the search suggestion drop-down list; there's no need for it anymore if I'm going to just use the main search results anyway.

**EDIT2:** So I realized there were a ton of errors after looking at the file my scraper returned. I've spent the past couple of days rewriting the crawler and now it works error free as far as I can tell. I also wrote my own program to remove duplicates from the list. The problem though now is a lot of the songs come with funny tags like (Instrumental) or (feat. So and So) and the service I use to generate the playlists can't handle that very well.

If I can get to it today I hope to make a way to update the play list every time Marketplace does. Fingers crossed! There's also the issue of the approximately 3000 songs that Spotify either doesn't have or can't find. I've been working hard on this so don't say OP never did anything for yah!

**I call this one: [Marketplace.org Playlist MkVI](http://open.spotify.com/user/1214043627/playlist/6nFxweTaJVNHyfJAf7ytU8)**

Also if you've never listened NPR's Marketplace thou shouldst! Support public radio y'all it's the best radio we've got!

**ISSUE:** ~~Let me know if the playlist isn't showing up for you. It's not showing up on my other devices.~~ I think I managed to bypass the current spotify playlist bug where it won't update if you post more than 300 songs at a time. Had to hand copy and paste all that. Anywho

And then I started looking closer at the stuff I wanted it to do for me.
I run Spotify mostly from an old Droid I have, because you guys suck at it. 

As an example

And then there's the bandwidth issue. Google devoured 2.45G of data in about 5 hours of streaming. Now, but at the same time, there's something to be said about being a little aware of how much you use. At any rate, I don't think I hit 1g for an entire day's worth of Spotify streaming.

Now, but I gotta admit that Google makes this stupid easy...) I don't know why they don't know that Spotify does this already, and does it in a way that trades less bandwidth for more room in device storage. I've had all my gap fillers on Spotify pretty much since day one, and using Dropbox, it's stupid easy to keep two laptops, a desktop, two phones

I've also heard how people like the Radio feature of Google over Spotify

Even the 'Shuffle' issue has a workaround

I seriously considered using Google and cancelling Spotify

I do have one hope, etc, etc) and attempts to improve on the things that are commonly complained about. (Shuffle feature, making 'owned' music integration much easier, profile pics without FB integration, etc.) You may have kept me for now Spotify, but I guarantee that many are jumping ship because of a multitude of minor issues that should have been fixed a long time ago. 

And if Google happens to fix the DL time and data usage issues I brought up

I started playing the violin in kindergarten (I'm 30 now) and was brought up with classical music. I really didn't get into modern music until my mid teens. So I have a head start but honestly it is incredible to me just how small of a part classical music plays in people's lives. I'm no virtuoso violinist. In fact I'm not even all that good at it, skrillex, miniature tigers, the walkmen, etc...

Anyways the reason I tell you all this is that I figure some of you might be curious but not even know where to start with classical music. So I want to share with you a series of short pieces (""variations"") by Edward Elgar that are truly amazing. 

Because in my years of listening to modern music I have heard some powerful stuff but rarely anything that gives me goosebumps or much less make my eyes water. I'm not talking about sadness but of sonic beauty

For those of you willing to give it a try you need to hear me out on this. You shouldn't just put it on in the background and read a book or study. Well you can but I suggest that the first time that you listen to this you find a nice calm comfortable and quiet place where you will not be interrupted. Put on some headphones too

Turn it up to a comfortable but semi loud volume (it will get louder so make sure you're prepared) and start with the first variation. Don't let it shuffle! Go in order

It's not the most exciting at the beginning

I'm curious what your impressions are. Please don't be shy, or if it was a total waste of time. But only if you gave it your full attention for all 15 tracks (some are less than a minute). Hey maybe I'm just over sentimental or something! 

The story behind the Enigma Variations is quite interesting

Ok so without further diarrhea of the mouth I present to you [Edward Elgar's Variations on a Theme](http://open.spotify.com/user/snowfro/playlist/5HCzoMGP6pq7deVYvGseHt).

Instead they're following the same BS model that has pissed everyone off about TV since the 80s.  I'm driving around

Sorry

Edit: Since a bunch of people are making assumptions, and then you hear the exact same songs every single f'ing day.  So I was **testing Spotify's radio to see if it was better.**  I don't particularly care for/need the ability to access any song I want at any time.  I just want a good radio app that plays a variety of music instead of (what seems to be the case with Pandora) a single playlist on shuffle.

I guess I just wish that these kind of Pandora-esque (and even Pandora) players would give you the option to say why you didn't like the song you gave a thumbs down to. Something with choices like

* I don't like this artist in general

Is there hip hop? A small amount for credibility. (Beastie Boys)

Is there Creed? No. GTFO!

I love music and I love searching for new stuff that I like.

Figured why not try and maintain a playlist for people that perhaps does not have as much time as me finding new stuff.

What to expect on this playlist:

**Folk/Singer songwriters**: I love Nick Drake and I love the new wave of artists that incorporate banjos and otherwise try to take their sound back a few years.

Expect artists like: Elephant revival

**Hip Hop**: One of my biggest loves in music. It is one of the best mediums to deliver good lyrics. Im very fond of storytelling in music and some hip hop artists are very good at it. I also have a preference for jazzy beats.

Expect: Atmosphere, living legends etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Kanye west

**Rock**: This is such a big genre it's hard to not find something you like.

What I like the most are either progressive rock or blues rock. But I also like classic rock and alternative.

Expect: Jimi Hendrix, Rival Sons etc.

**Electronic**: I like some electronic music but im not the biggest fan in the world. I also have a bad grasp of the subgenres here so I usually just lump them together.

Expect: The Knife, Phantogram etc.

Do not expect: DUBSTEP.
**
Metal**: again im not the biggest fan but there are some great artists out there.

Expect: Mastodon, Baroness, Opeth etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Powermetal.

**Lounge/Trip Hop/Nu jazz**: I love jazzy beats and I also like the electronic swing movement

Expect: RJD2, Waldeck, Jaga Jazzist etc.

**Blues/Jazz**: Usually I like music that is inspired by these genres but im not a puritan.

Expect: Tom waits, Jan Johansson etc.
**
Ska/Reggae**: Sunshine music.

Expect: Toots and the maytals

**Sort after ""added"" that way you always get the newly added songs at the top.**

So far I have (the obvious ones):

- The Beatles

- Metallica

- Bone Thugs-N-Harmony (most albums)

- Dr. Dre - The Chronic (not 2001

- Couple of single songs

This is all in the Netherlands. Wondering if these are also missing in other regions and what the reason might be. I know some artists like Metallica simply refuse to be on Spotify

Also in the case of the old Dr. Dre album. No clue if there is a licensing issue or it has simply been forgotten.

Any insight is appreciated!

http://open.spotify.com/track/0KDgzTszGzPjsNtf2TktOy

Not that interesting to look at

* Go to your playlist 
* Copy it all by hitting CTRL-A then CTRL-C
* Open a word processor like Google Docs
* Paste the list



&gt; Dropkick Murphys – I'm Shipping Up To Boston

&gt; Blood Red Shoes – I Wish I Was Someone Better

&gt; Neon Trees – Animal

* Now you can copy the list as text and paste it in comments/posts.

I tried using offline mode, which is not what I want. This definitely shouldn't be an answer, though - why stream that stuff, offline or no offline, if it's stitting already downloaded right here on my phone? Nothing should be streamed in this case, unless the tracks get updated, or something.

I love music and I love searching for new stuff that I like. 

Figured why not try and maintain a playlist for people that perhaps does not have as much time as me finding stuff that they haven't heard before.

What to expect on this playlist:

**Folk/Singer songwriters**: I love Nick Drake and I love the new wave of artists that incorporate banjos and otherwise try to take their sound back a few years. 

Expect artists like: Elephant revival

**Hip Hop**: One of my biggest loves in music. It is one of the best mediums to deliver good lyrics. Im very fond of storytelling in music and some hip hop artists are very good at it. I also have a preference for jazzy beats.

Expect: Atmosphere, living legends etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Kanye west

**Rock**: This is such a big genre it's hard to not find something you like.

What I like the most are either progressive rock or blues rock. But I also like classic rock and alternative.

Expect: Jimi Hendrix, Rival Sons etc.


**Electronic**: I like some electronic music but im not the biggest fan in the world. I also have a bad grasp of the subgenres here so I usually just lump them together.

Expect: The Knife, Phantogram etc.

Do not expect: DUBSTEP.

**Metal**: again im not the biggest fan but there are some great artists out there.

Expect: Mastodon, Baroness, Opeth etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Powermetal.

**Lounge/Trip Hop/Nu jazz:** I love jazzy beats and I also like the electronic swing movement

Expect: RJD2, Waldeck, Jaga Jazzist etc.

**Blues/Jazz**: Usually I like music that is inspired by these genres but im not a puritan. 

Expect: Tom waits, Jan Johansson etc.

**Ska/Reggae**: Sunshine music.

Expect: Toots and the maytals


I have added 100 something tunes to the playlist and Ill add a few songs a week if people show interest. It's by no means a 100 best songs I know but just 100 songs I like.

One feature that was truly amazing was track-by-track comments. So you could essentially walk someone through your playlist. People used this to essentially tell stories punctuated by music

I think one of the biggest parts of sharing music with people is explaining why a song is so perfect and interpreting it. Just dumping a list of tracks on someone does not communicate that. I know Spotify employees stop by here... I think this would be a simple and elegant addition to the service.

What do you think?

I'm Inge, I want to thank you for joining our community.
 
The team has been very busy over the past few weeks getting ready for a major update to Soundrop. We're very excited for this new version and wanted to share the news with you personally. It has some important improvements to the overall experience of using Soundrop. We think you'll really like it.
 
Here's what we've done:
 
- We fixed the ""track not available in your region"" issue. Instead of doing what Depeche Mode recommends and enjoying the silence
 
- We greatly improved how you create and control your room. When you open a room, or ""curated"" which means people can only vote. You control the tracks. You can also customize your room with own picture and room name, and you can tag it so others can easily find it.
 
- Speaking of finding rooms. You can also make your room discoverable by any Soundrop user. If you want to search for rooms
 
- We improved the chat. You can now resize the chat area and also ignore users.
 
We've made a number of other improvements--some small and some big. You'll see it immediately if you get started. Look for a version number starting 1.6 in the lower right-hand corner. If you don't see it
 
If you have any questions or comments, or our Facebook page.
 
Thanks for being part of the Soundrop community.
 
All the best
Inge

In the past I've listed all the bands/tracks

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The playlist focuses mostly on what is considered folk and alternative rock genres. I like playful music that challenges their genre, post-punk, screamo, folk, punk, rock, electronica, dream-pop and a bit here and there. 

There's no r'-n-b' though


&amp;nbsp;

This playlist is can basically be a gateway (drug) into the music scene for those who haven't been religiously checking what the music press has to say about recent releases. Remember to check out the full albums of your new discoveries.

The idea is stream of consciousness. Maybe the song you add sounds exactly like the last one; maybe it's a cover of that last song

Rules: don't mess with the order. Add one song. Enjoy.

If you feel extra non-lazy post here why you added said track.

I'm starting with Blitzen Trapper's Destroyer of the Void. Lots of places to jump off from here.

Who's game?

When i try to retrieve my password on the spotify website. I get a message from the server saying that the email adress is not connected to any active spotify account which is odd because i've been getting emails from spotify on that same email account for over a year. There's no way to contact spotify by phone and i've sent an email already but i havn't gotten an answer as of yet. Does anyone have an idea what might be going on?,,
