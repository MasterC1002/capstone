Status Update
By Dave Lombardo
Statement From Dave Lombardo Regarding Slayer Australian Tour 2013

I want to personally apologize to all of our fans in Australia who have bought tickets for the tour expecting to see me in my usual place on the drums.

So that you all know the truth, and to be honest I am shocked by the situation. 

Last year, this is not the way a band’s business should operate. I tried rectifying it by letting my band mates know, and Tom and I hired auditors to figure out what happened, but I was denied access to detailed information and the necessary back up documents. 

I spent the Christmas and New Year holidays realizing I had toured all over the world in 2012, I was told that I would not be paid until I signed a long form contract which gave me no written assurance of how much or on what basis management would deduct commissions, nor did it provide me access to the financial budgets or records for review. It also forbade me to do interviews or make statements having to do with the band, in effect a gagging order.

Last Monday, I arrived at rehearsals at 1 pm as scheduled, but Kerry did not show. Rather, at 6:24 pm I received an email from the lawyers saying I was being replaced for the Australian dates.

I remain hopeful that we can resolve our issues. But once again
I look forward to seeing you in the future.

Sincerely
Dave Lombardo",,t5_2qhud,1361497565.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/18xwmy/dave_lombardo_is_no_longer_in_slayer_taken_from/

Prior to the Birmingham show, and the good people there saw that they were using the exact gear that was missing. The Birmingham scene took action and confronted Evil Army

Next
&gt; THAT WAS A BADASS TOUR. EVERY CITY WAS AWESOME. THE VENUES WERE PACKED OUT AND WE SOLD OUT OF MERCH BY THE TIME THE NEW ORLEANS SHOW WAS OVER. THANKS TO EVERY ONE FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT EVIL ARMY. WEST COAST TOUR COMING UP. WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER. oh and just a ps. no one gives a shit about what the little people in ga are saying. everyone knows better than to believe their shit. no sweat off our backs and we r gonna keep on thrashn. 

and this...

&gt;who ever is saying evil army stole something needs to come to memphis and say it to our face. did you see our badass van and all our equipment?? WE dont need to steal we have everything we need. our new bass player was borrowing equipment AT EVERY SHOW AND WE ALSO HAVE A BASS RIG ON BACKORDER THAT IS PAID FOR SO THERE IS NO REASON TO STEAL FROM ANYONE. SO ALL U BITCHES TALKING SHIT GO FUCK URSELF AND KNOW UR FACTS BEFORE U START ACCUSING SHIT. LAST NITE IN BIRMINGHAM SOMEONE STOLE FROM US AND WE KICK SOME DUDES ASS OVER IT SO IT WONT BE A PROB DOING IT AGAIN.

The fact of the matter is that according to several witnesses, taking back what is rightfully yours is not stealing. They were caught red handed and they are denying everything. 

This band is a bunch of junkies. Don't let them come to your city and steal from your locals in the future. Word is already quickly spreading and there has been a tremendous amount of support shown for the Atlanta locals who got fucked over. Organizers/bookers from all the way down south and all the way up to Canada have said that Evil Army is no longer welcome in their cities. The gear is now in the possession of friends in Birmingham and will be recovered shortly. 

Thank you to those who take a stand against this sort of behavior

Edit - Please upvote for visibility and spread the word on any relevant forums

Edit 2 - Turns out Aaron Kelly is the merch girl I believe

Edit 3 - Turns out the gear they actually borrowed during the show was Disfigurement's according to the Disfigurement singer. They must have gone into the storage room at the venue and taken the amp that belonged to Sadistic Ritual from that room.

But this attitude is almost never reciprocated. I was at a party earlier (happy new year!), I was absolutely not about to put on metal. And yet,  I got skeptical looks, and was told that people wouldn't want to listen to my music, and a bit of a disagreement followed.

I am offended for two reasons. 

Firstly

Secondly, people assumed I was trying to sneakily get some metal in without them noticing (like they wouldn't!). So I'm insulted because my friends seem to think that I'm so socially unaware that I wouldn't accommodate their distaste of metal. 

This has happened several times with the same group, I'll put on the Fratellis, that'll be fun!', and I got the same reaction (No, don't put on your music!), because people didn't know who the Fratellis are even though they're happy fun pop rock. Similarly with the Butterfly Effect (ok, maybe they're a bit heavy), people just *assumed* it was going to be horrible melodic death metal

Though ideally I wish this wasn't an issue at all and I could just put my music on the same way everyone else does.

1365110682.0,1bossh,Guide to Mastodon,Zinchism,637,133,151,"I thoroughly enjoy these guides and think its a great way for people to get into a band. Seeing as how Mastodon is my favorite band

**Remission** - This is a very out of control riff-house type album. The vocals are all not necessarily screamed, it's tons of crunchy riffs with some bad ass jazz-like drumming in the background. Very raw, spastic, and over all just kick ass metal. The album is loosely based on the theme of fire. Some of of the must listen tracks are [March of the Fire Ants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MarWv25GOyw) and [Mother Puncher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFtXyTZKKY)

**Leviathan** - This album's most notable change is the fact that the vocals sounds more like rough, based around the book ""Moby Dick"" and also the theme of water in general. The crunchy sounding riffs are still there and its still fucking bad ass. As for what songs are must listens, [Blood and Thunder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Su1YXQYek) and [Iron Tusk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzVcC0TAN8k) would serve you right.

**Blood Mountain** - This is when everything gets more proggy. This album is, riffy metal. It's sort of toned down a bit in terms of riffage, but, its not a bad thing. It sounds a bit more patient and smoother, if that makes sense. There'll be parts when the music tones down and its clean vocals kick in and it gets less heavy sounding. Speaking of vocals, the vocals are half clean and half yelled/grunted/whatever. Must listens are [The Wolf is Loose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm9P1QsoGhw) and [Siberian Divide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2IGkpkagz8)

**Crack The Skye** - This is when things get REALLY proggy. The album is another concept album story. This time, but, he flies too close to the sun when hes out of his body and it burns his golden umbilical cord that keeps him from drifting off. He begins to drift off into space, but, gets sucked into a wormhole where he explains to the spirits that he's not dead. They send him to Czarist era Russia where cultists are performing a divination. He ends up in the body of Rasputin. He explains to Rasputin his situation, but, then Czarina warns Rasputin that he's going to be assassinated. Instead of avoiding this, they fly between heaven and hell where Satan intercepts them and takes them to hell. They escape and its assumed they either make it to his body or stay in space forever. The album is also generally based around the element of Ether. Sorry, it's still metal. There's many more guitar solos

**The Hunter** - The Hunter is kind of the result of them getting tired of making these elaborate concept albums, its heavier than Crack The Skye, but, not as heavy as their other albums, but, it still maintains their sound. It's got some sweet riffs and some good vocal pieces. It's a perfectly put together album for what it is, if that makes sense. Must listens are [Curl of the Burl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAihDAJX8Ow) and [Stargasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fte2YrMta7g)

**Call of The Mastodon** - This is just a remastered compilation of their demo with one new song, delivery is definitely a lil different. There's definitely some grind influence in here. Musically, its just a lot of bad ass riffs, not too melodic, just plundering, pillaging riffs to headbang to. It seems like they wanted to pump out a bunch of angry, bursty, which they did. Fantastic songs. Must listens are [Shadows That Move]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93ttGgeUX4) and [Hail To Fire]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIwFfdUD2TE)

No, listen to them.  If you don't, *don't comment* and *don't downvote*.  I don't want this turning into r/circlejerk, but enough is enough.  All you seem to do, and I'm gonna catch hell for this, is act like the hipsters you so despise.

This ""My metal is more valid than [X]'s metal because [blah blah blah]"" attitude you two (and others) perpetuate is what's fucking killing Shreddit, another song with terrible production.  I guess ProTools is too popular for these hipsters, huh?  I guess they just want their LPs to sound like demos.""

Get the fuck off your high horses people; our diverse tastes in music are what makes metal great.  Without that, the solos inspired by blues and classical music, or the epic vocals drawn straight from opera and classical performance.  Act like you've got some common fucking decency about yourselves, and start respecting that there are people out there who will like bands that you do not.  Just hide their submissions and move along.

Ban me if you want, because all you do is pick out bands that you don't like and bash them for not being exactly what you want to hear.  You know, [the same thing that critics did to the original Black Sabbath LP when it first hit shelves](http://bit.ly/dmfk6j).

EDIT: Alright

Oh yeah, etc.- I'm not the one calling for the death of whatever metal I don't like.  It's my opinion that this board should at least be civil and respectful, and if that's not your opinion, then I'm not altogether sure you belong here.  If you think that this subreddit should be a place for you to spout off about how much you hate [X]'s musical taste, perhaps we need a r/metalcirclejerk for you and the rest of the ""old school"" guys on here.

As a fan of a broad spectrum of metal, not complex enough, or simply appeal to an audience that most of us are not a part of. 

However

Few, Cannibal Corpse or Meshuggah, for instance. The growls and screams, the distorted guitar, the complex drums, these are things that grow on you, slowly (or sometimes quickly) and over time. 

So, more intricate bands that we know and love, a stepping stone of sorts.

So, and I suppose I simply want to take a moment to acknowledge these bands for being the entry-level bands they are when it comes to the metal genre(s). These are the bands that mix into the radio lineups of Nickleback and Theory of a Deadman and Limp Biscuit, and these are the bands that help others submerge themselves in metal, the tip of the iceberg, if you will.

&gt; Instead post to /r/MusicPics, /r/BandPorn, /r/MetalMemes, /r/LookWhoIMet, /r/Pics or /r/MetalPorn

The reason for this change is a core reddit problem. It takes a second to view &amp; upvote an image - regardless of quality

As the subreddit grows (115 subscriptions per day)

The mission statement will be changed from:

&gt; All things metal, thrash metal, speed metal, doom metal, traditional metal, power metal, grindcore

to:

&gt; Music, thrash metal, speed metal, doom metal, traditional metal, power metal, grindcore

In addition, but it has fallen victim to the problem it was fighting. Hopefully the image shake-up will help change this.

1365113807.0,1box9l,Guide to Opeth,Jumpset,339,78,94,"I'm not entirely sure if we are doing this for blacklisted bands or not

**Orchid** (1995) - The debut. This album features a sound that is heavily influenced by black metal in many places

Must listen: [In The Mist She Was Standing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtasXTviObo) - [The Apostle in Triumph](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YG-mtaAAQE)

**Morningrise** (1996) - This album might be a difficult listen for some people. Its sound is rather raw in many places and the black metal influences are very noticeable. However, which lasts 20:15.

Must listen: [Advent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9clLCHQKvsE) - [Black Rose Immortal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnCyXOTfsX4)

**My Arms, with all songs being shorter than 10 minutes, whereas the previous record *Morningrise* only featured songs which were above the 10 minute mark.

Must listen: [When](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ZHajw3-3s) - [Demon of the Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrBrH5PZtcc) - [April Ethereal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf8PJvUpjog)

**Still Life** (1999) - This album is, it can be described as more mellow  than *My Arms, Your Hearse*, but it is not less heavy. Overall, the sound of this album is different than the band's earlier works in that the acoustic parts became more prominent and the heavy parts became even more death metal-esque. With *Benighted* and *Face of Melinda*, it is the first Opeth record to feature multiple songs which do not have harsh vocals, with *Benighted* being a fully acoustic ballad.

Must listen: [The Moor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf7REF_qcxQ) - [Serenity Painted Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPsS2rczL4) - [Face of Melinda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg155CcGKE)... Actually

**Blackwater Park** (2001) - This album is regarded as Opeth's masterpiece by many. Musically

Must listen: [The Drapery Falls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfslLWySZYg) - [Blackwater Park](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb9C1u8HsR8) - [Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWdCRYEZGE)

**Deliverance** &amp; **Damnation** (2002/2003) - These two albums were meant to be a double album, death metal influenced record, and *Damnation* being completely clean and, essentially, a progressive rock album. However, even though these albums are meant to go together, both can be appreciated separately.

Must listen: [Deliverance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-PaT0Bgj-Y) - [Master's Apprentices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G6PQLpNad8) -- [Windowpane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CvltVKjacw) - [In My Time of Need](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZixJQDgZrqA)

**Ghost Reveries** (2005) - This album's sound is rather interesting. It could be described as similar to *Deliverance*

Must listen: [Ghost of Perdition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-AEolkRkj4) - [The Grand Conjuration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL3xWJxr_Sw)

**Watershed** (2008) - An album which marks a rather drastic change in the band's sound. The clean parts became even more influenced by progressive rock and more prevalent, too. Overall, it is a very interesting record that is different from the others (and it is actually my least favorite Opeth album, but I'll leave the decision up to you).

Must listen: [Heir Apparent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbJCgDtjSDg)

**Heritage** (2011) - Now this is where it gets interesting. This album marks a complete departure from the band's previous sound, even incorporating jazz influences. The fact that it can barely be considered a metal record anymore caused some controversy among fans, but just because it is (very) different, this does not mean it is bad. I recommend listening to it - you don't have to like it.

The guy was a total douche nozzle though.  I've never seen such a horrid blend of uneducated idiocy, he kept asking me if I had a smart phone so that I could google him, and then when I told him I didn't, he was desperately trying to show me pictures of him on stage in front of crowds.  When I said, ""that's cool man, good for you,"" he took personal offense and then tried to say that I had no taste in music and probably listened to shit.

Through the drunken conversations with my friends he eventually pretended to be an expert on American history and European geography

""First of all

We have been keeping our heads down and not speaking out due to the fluid nature of the situation and the constantly changing information that even we receive daily.
Within an hour things can do endless 180's. It's maddening to try and make heads or tails.

We're taking the time to speak to you as it has been a significant period of time since this situation began and while nothing is immediately clear to any of us

We have reached out and are making use of the resources we have acquired to help our brother who is still detained in Czech jail.

In the two years since

Randy is our brother and we assure you

The best we can do is to stay positive and continue to support our friend that we know is innocent.

We know that justice will prevail and we will continue to do our part to support our friend.

Legacy of Disorder opened up, even though at that point the mosh pit was lacking.  I don't normally enjoy the deep throat singing that seems prevalent in most metal, but there was something that made it seem just right.  

The Cancerbats were the second band up, and nobody was doing it.  The guitar/bass were the best part about the band, and even they were pretty lackluster.  I really did not enjoy them at all and you'd have to pay me to get me to go back to one of their concerts. Honestly, they looked like they had started the after party the day before and were not planning on quitting.  I think their performance suffered because of it.  

Then there was DevilDriver... Holy shit, I'ld say that Legacy of Disorder and DevilDriver were on par with each other.  


Then there was the headliner, ejaculate, EVERYWHERE.  Some poor kid(looked 18ish) was crowdsurfing when Oderus released his kraken and took the first blast to the face.  He had the stream on him for probably 15-20 seconds straight.  He will be green for days.  
GWAR's costumes were more elaborate than I had thought.  There was minions running around swinging swords and jamming air guitar on the swords.  I absolutely Loved this concert.  I would gladly see GWAR again.  Also

Goblin Metal? You Heard Right!
Los Angeles

Official Music Video for ‘No One Survives’ – 2 MILLION VIEWS and Counting - http://youtu.be/KsMKOx6fumc

What happens when you put a bunch of bloodthirsty music-loving goblins together? Well, and practicing only every other leap year on a full moon, NEKROGOBLIKON has finally perfected their brand of crushing music. Arguably the first ever goblin metal band ever, NEKROGOBLIKON is pleased to announce the upcoming release of their brand new crusher of a record, Power, hitting stores on August 27, 2013. Power is produced by NEKROGOBLIKON, Children of Bodom).

For a taste of what NEKROGOBLIKON is about, who has since shot a Major Lazer video, as well as the new Wavves video. Dermer had the chance to catch NEKROGOBLIKON performing in front of a small crowd of people at The Cobalt in Canoga Park, CA, immediately fell in love with the band, the rest is history. The video for ‘No One Survives’ ended up pulling in 1 million+ views in its first week of release.

Currently hailing from the grim metal locale of Los Angeles, Goblin Island, a musical hell-storm of goblin proportions, was recorded over the summer and early fall of 2006. They released it themselves on New Year’s Day of 2007.

NEKROGOBLIKON did the usual band-member musical chairs for a while, Stench (2011), which was produced by NEKROGOBLIKON with Zack Ohren at Castle Ultimate Studios and the Goblin Fortress.

NEKROGOBLIKON is proudly endorsed by Vic Firth, Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park, etc.

2) My associates who are into metal are **not** into anything other than metal. They give this holier than thou attitude and refuse to listen to anything that doesn't take it to eleven.

It's frustrating because I think there's a lot of common ground musically. For example, but was caught in a catch 22 for sharing. A metal friend accused them of being too non-kvlt for him, whereas a non-metal friend said they were too metal for him.

It's immensely frustrating because it's just fucking music

I'm just fed up with the attitude so many of my metal brähs give towards anything non-metal that's good. Like, the non-metal approach anxiety to anything that's abrasive.

Why can't we just like good fucking music and be done with it? Obviously your milage may vary

Also, but who cares? If you do care, listen to an Urfaust album until you become an appropriate vessel for Satan and maybe you'll feel differently when you're inhabited by the great deceiver.

So quit this former nu-metal fan apologism crap that I see in every nostalgia thread. I'd rather listen to Slipknot's laughable attempts at making ""accessible blackened death"" than to most of the garbage infecting Nashville radio right now.

So I just saw Behemoth live in Kansas on Monday, he kicked the shit out of it.  This Monday they returned to my hometown and it was the best concert of my life! (even though what opening bands we saw were rubbish)

I made a shirt that said [ADAM : 1 Leukemia : 0](http://i.imgur.com/bp7El.jpg) (terrible pic

I worked my way up through the crowd and got right up on the railing. When the lights flashed on the crowd I lifted the shit up and made sure Adam could see it.  I noticed him reading it.  A few songs passed and then I took the shirt I made off (I had an undershirt on, SMILED, AND ACKNOWLEDGED ME WITH APPROVAL. Game over man, game over.... The rest of the show I was on cloud 9... no fuck that, I was on cloud 17.  

So I get home roughly and hour and a half or so after the show is over and my fucking jaw is hurting from smiling so much and just having an absolute fucking blast.  I hop on their Facebook page because some bands post shit about their previous show and I was hoping to see something on there, for some reason I knew that he kept the shirt.

Out of sheer curiosity I decided to reload their FB page in the morning.  [HOLY FUCK! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!](http://i.imgur.com/31YS3.jpg) Adam actually took a picture of MY SHIRT

Thank you Nergal, and Seth.  Thank you Behemoth.  Thank you for blowing my fucking mind with your awesome performance, and thank you for understanding how a simple gesture can create a memory that I will have with me for the rest of my life.  Please do yourself a favor and go see Behemoth. You deserve it, and so do they.

EDIT : Adam [posted](http://i.imgur.com/AIhcV.jpg) on his official page as well. AND its even MORE badass!  I replied to him and put the link to this post on it.  Would be AMAZING if he read it!

We are a female fronted power metal band from Deland Florida. We formed back in 2007

Our members include:

Sabrina Valentine - Vocals

Camden Cruz - Guitar

Kevin Byrd - Guitar

Keith Byrd - Drums

Aaron Sluss - Bass

Our band has done a lot of awesome stuff, and have even done a successful mini-tour with independant bands put together by our management crew [Intromental!](http://www.intromental.com) 

Get familiar with some of our stuff on [Spotify too](http://open.spotify.com/artist/0PMYvG0U25tgSi8jQExPAC)!

Aside from that,000 views so far. 

You can [check it out on youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hpa6f6s23PE)

We're hoping to be able to shed some light on what it's like being in a band that's trying so hard to make it as a band and what it's like to be involved in the music industry. And also to promote our album. Fire away!

And now

My band had prepared for months a gig where we just headed straight to town with a generator and our equipment

Today

Followed by a shitload of preparation, and a bigger load of luck, we executed it perfectly and better than we could hope.

Earlier this day, we started packing everything into the van that is seen behind us. The entire band drove to a seemingly deserted place to test our outdoor-sound. It was splendid, until a woman who we had apparently disturbed yelled at us. We packed our shit, drove to Bergen town, and parked the transportation car while the van parked at the heart of Bergen, the blue stone. We put on our morph suits (to remain anonymous) and walked through town both scaring and entertaining people.

We proceeded to the van

When all was set, over 200 people were watching. They cheered.

When we were done

Let me translate the first one briefly:

Headline: - Where's the police?

*We had expected the police to stop this gig before it even started.* said the frontman.

Then they wrote about our planning stage (we were interviewed)

A quote from our vocalist saying it's about peace and love

Another quote from an old spectator: Fuck off

Some info about how unexpected it was


And that pretty much sums up the other article too. Use google translate and set it to Norwegian if you wanna read a poor version. Any questions?

I talked about the history of metal, and even debunked some stereotypical myths about metalheads.  I even played a video sampling songs to show the diversity of the genre, which included Stratovarius, Yngwie Malmsteen, Testament, Megadeth, and Rainbow.

This is what my emailed me after class:

1311935678.0,j33t1,Tales from a military gym. I had to share this with you all :),DocLefty,282,96,165,"So I am in the military on a ship, rap/rock etc... basically terrible generic music that predominates in every military gym. Well the iPod they were using apparently shorted out yesterday because of a heavy sweater and they did not have tunes. I offered to hook mine up but told them it is all metal and the like

Within 10 seconds there is the sweet, followed by Lamb of God, and then some Killswitch, AILD, ATR, and of course my personal fave Unearth. After about 15-20 minutes one of the guys walks up and asks me: ""What...what the fuck is this shit? I can't understand the words to a lot of it but it makes me want to beat the shit out of someone."" I told him that in addition to being actual great music from actual musicians, it had the side effect of making workouts MUCH more productive. I figured that was the first - and last - time I would be asked to provide tuneage for the gym. So this was yesterday. 

Fast forward to today and I am down in the gym with my headphones in. Someone else hooks up their iPod and starts playing some Yellow Card (NOT a bad band IMHO but not work-out tunes by a fucking long shot). Within a few minutes I have about 12 people ask me to hook my ipod up, this is fucking unreal!"" 

EDIT: I realize that none of the bands I listed previously are death or black metal. I can't work out to Cattle Decapitation or Children of Bodom or the like, I don't think introducing someone to Metal would work if I used black/death metal.

**In the Nightside Eclipse** (1994) - Regarded by many as one of the greatest black metal albums ever released, echoey drums, and almost negligent bass create a ""wall of sound"" that is typical of black metal at the time but what really brings out the melody and songwriting are the heavy use of symphonic keyboards.  The keys create this epic, romantic and somber feeling that can take you to another world (at least for me it does).  This album is definitely the simplest in terms of musicianship but the songwriting from Ihsahn more than makes up for any perceived deficiency in that area.  Also, *Inno a Satana* gives us our first glimpse at Ihsahn's clean vocals.

Must listen: [Into the Infinity of Thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tccZs_veliA), [Inno a Satana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PvYoCVAgFg)

**Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk** (1997) - Emperor really amps up the musicianship on this one.  I would say that this album is *In the Nightside Eclipse* on steroids.  We see a newcomer in the band, the keyboard synth has become more varied.  Instead of the typical vocal ""ahhs"" which were much more prevalent on the first album, we hear more strings and brass.  The production irks me a bit as I feel the vocals are too low in the mix and the bass drum is too high in the mix but that may be personal preference.  Ihsahn puts more of his clean vocals on display here.

Must listen: [The Loss and Curse of Reverence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BI4_NMxPb8)

**IX Equilibrium** (1999) - With this album the songwriting has become more varied.  Also, especially on *An Elegy of Icaros* and the synth seems more upfront.  Many would say this is their weakest album, but there are some great tracks.

Must listen: [Curse You All Men!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHCCaP0dAE)

**Prometheus - The Discipline of Fire &amp; Demise** (2001) - Emperor's final album and boy is it a doozy (I mean this in a good way, in terms of replicating real instruments, is far and away better than the previous albums.  We see the use of brass, strings and even some harpischord &amp; electronic sounds throughout.  This album is also Emperor's most technical and Ihashn and Samoth both employ 7-string guitars on this.  Don't worry, the 7-strings aren't used to chug-a-lug through the songs but are used appropriately.  Also, it is important to note that every Emperor album has had roots in classical music but this album in particular is seething with classical influence and bombast.  It's quite amazing to see how much Emperor has transformed over the years to get to this point and to be their final album and go out on something this magnificent is truly remarkable.

Must listen: [The Eruption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QeW-tyRbl8), [Thorns on My Grave](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt6TDAys040)

I hope you all enjoyed my guide.  I really enjoyed doing this as I am a huge fan of Emperor.

I have an example:
The reason I made this: we made a [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1165939595/the-death-march-begins), because they are a group of funny guys, and I could still take them seriously because of how the music side and the personal side are held apart, but they're a national act where you HAVE to take them seriously.

tl;dr- What do you guys think of ""funny"" metal bands? If a band is completely serious on stage and are joking around off stage does it make the stage persona look like an obvious act

Also a big disclaimer: ""Funny"" is a very broad word. If you watch the kickstarter, but it's the idea that I'm trying to get across.",,False,,t5_2qhud,False,,
