--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE 5/15 10:45PM EST**:  
* Champ's Sports and House of Hoops will be doing staggered releases in addition to what's releasing on 5/25. There will be TLO releases each day of the week leading up to 5/25.  
* Cool Grey 9s and Crimson 3s are added to the list of shoes that will be restocked. No word yet where exactly

**UPDATE 5/16 9:30AM EST**:  
 * KD Vs were added to the shipping out list.  
   --- Hulks, Easters, Home, The Black Pack, and Elites  
* Added a compilation of links previously tweeted for restocks. No promises that they'll work

**UPDATE 5/18 8:53AM EST**:  
* Your local stores should have a better idea of what they're getting now with all the releases  this morning pretty much done. Try giving them a call. Most places will know if they'll be doing ticketing/raffles
* Added White Cement 4s to the list of Foot Locker/House of Hoops. Some stores are getting them in now

edit: On the WC4s

**UPDATE 5/18 4:30PM EST**:  
* Sorry to everyone I told that NDC will release all the product links at one time (8AM EST). The speculation is currently that that is not the case. NDC may be looking into releasing links at different times of the day. This restock is so chaotic

I've also compiled a twitter list (you'll only see the above accounts on the twitter feed) on my main twitter account. You can view that **[here](https://twitter.com/TurnonGaming/sneakers)**.
__________________________________________________
This info is taken from Niketalk.com as well as calling a lot of stores (I've done about 20-30 myself) and trying to confirm what they'll be receiving. This is just a copy/paste from niketalk.com because it's already organized and confirms everything I've found so far and then some. A lot of the information is from a user named 'kamuekcmo' who's been nothing but awesome over on Niketalk.com. 

For our friends that are new to being a sneakerhead...

* TLO = **T**witter **L**ink **O**nly -- The retailer will send out a link to the sneakers and that will be the only way to find them on their website.  
* NDC = **N**ike **D**ot **C**om -- [http://www.nike.com](http://www.nike.com)...  
* HOH = **H**ouse **O**f **H**oops -- Retail store started by Foot Locker.  
* GS = **G**rade **S**chool -- Essentially

--------------------------------------------------------------
Nike doesn't really change links for restocks, but there's a high chance they will. Links are from KINGkong34 on niketalk.

Would you like to take a few minutes to answer some questions? These are just a few basic questions to get some ideas of the demographics of this fine subreddit. This is almost exactly like the last one I posted a few months ago (which the results can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1bn4dt/rsneakers_census_results/)) but now that we've reached over 10

Last time I only got about 15% of subscribers to respond and I would really like to get more than that. I will leave this open longer

Thanks for your time!

is happening. 

Shit I know:

* NDC is indeed cancelling orders involving the DB3's/Mints if they were obtained with a bot. 

* If your shit was cancelled you've received an e-mail talking about the commitment to fairness

* There WILL be a restock (Think like that big ass one we had like a week ago) 

* This restock WILL have DB3's | DB 95's | Toro 4's | Hazelnut's | Mints etc.
    Pretty much anything that has been released since May/June up until August/September will be in this restock. 

* If the past is any example this restock WILL happen in September. Decide right now whether you want books for school or kicks (Just saying no girl has ever said ""oh that's such a nice book let's fuck"")

* ~~I completely forgot what this point was supposed to be so this is a place holder.~~

1357165463.0,15umiy,How to Legit Check your own shoes. A very large and evolving guide.,larry_bird_fan,118,12,30,"I’ve noticed that there’s been a ton of posts about legit checks lately and I thought it might be helpful to throw together a post with some things to check out. These won’t be all of the things that you should check


**General Rules**

* Is the stitching terrible? probably fake

* Do the materials on the shoe look like the materials used on real shoes?

* How’s the shape compared to a legit pair? This is the easiest way to tell on any fake shoe. The shape is almost always terrible

* Does the colorway actually exist? **KNOW YOUR COLORWAYS**

* Is the shoe priced under retail on a site with every Jordan ever made in a full size run? This means the site is fake 100% of the time. 

* If the site looks fake

* Does the seller have 0 feedback? Probably a scam

* Run a check on the size tag. Plug the code into google and your shoe will come up. If it doesn’t they’re fake.

* Look at the box if the shoes come with it

* Look at the tag on the box

**Jordan 1**

* Does the shoe have a hologram? Based off what they are should they have a hologram? If there’s a hologram on anything that’s not supposed to have one the shoes are fake. This is easy to check by looking up pictures of the shoes you’re trying to buy.

* Do the 1’s say Nike Air on the tongue? Are they from 1994 or earlier or the Banned 1’s from 2010? If they’re not they’re fake. (Excluding the newest releases coming in 2013)

* How does the toebox look? This is easy to check by looking at some pictures


**Jordan 2**
 
* The Jordan Wings logo on the tongue should be made of a quality rubber that’s 3D

* Is the logo on the back of the shoe right? Does it say Nike? Should it? If the logo is wrong the shoes are fake

**Jordan 3**

* Is the elephant print printed on? It should be a texture you can see and feel

* Is the shape and cut of the elephant print correct? It should take up roughly half the height of the shoe not including the sole. This is easy to check if you look at pictures of legit 3’s

* Is the leather perforated the correct way along the top of the shoe? It varies by year so look at pictures of the exact shoe you’re trying to buy

* Do they come with a metal jumpman hanging from a keychain? If they do they’re fake

**Jordan 4**

* Does the tongue come up high? The tongue on the 4’s goes up very high for a low top shoe and it should stretch back well into the shoe.

* Is the netting huge? It really shouldn’t be

* Is the netting crooked? It should go straight up and down

* Does the jumpman on the tongue look awful? This is a very common problem and is very easy to look for.

* Is the cement print terrible

* Is the mesh replaced with perforated leather? They’re fake unless they’re Columbia

**Jordan 5**

* Does the tongue come past the rest of the shoe? If it doesn’t they’re fake

* Are they made of the right material? If they’re Red Suded DMP’s they should be made of suede

* Does it have 23 on the side? Should it? If it’s wrong they’re fake Does the 23 have a shadow? If it doesn’t they’re fake

* Are they icy? If they’re from 2000 or earlier they probably shouldn’t be. 

* Is the tongue flat? It shouldn’t be, not flat. The tongue should also be wider than the entrance of the shoe.

* Is the jumpman on the tongue touching the top of the tongue? It shouldn’t be

**Jordan 6**

* Does the tongue go past the top of the shoe? It should

* Is the color blocking correct? It’s very common that fakes have the colors flipped on the midsole. Look up pictures of how your shoes should look

* Is the logo on the back right? The DMP’s have a jumpman and a 23

* Are the lace locks the right color? This is a very easy check to do

* Are the bubbles on the heel too flat or not stable? If they’re flat and not “fluffy” then they’re fake

* Is the lace cover on top made of the right material? Does the jumpman look awful?

* Check the color of the airbag and the jumpman on the back

**Jordan 7**

* Is the number on the heel correct? It shouldn’t be 23 if the shoe is an Olympic colorway  or the Miro’s 

* Is the shape right? The shape on 7’s is almost always a dead giveaway
Is the Air Jordan on the tongue the right size

* The pointed tabs on the bottom of the shoe should be pointed

* Are the holes on the sides in the right places? If they’re not they’re fake

**Jordan 8** 

* Are the colors on the carpet tongue in the right order? 

* On the plastic tab on the side of the shoe there shouldn’t be much empty space. The strips of color should take up almost all of the area.

* Is the hash pattern on the midsole present? Is it the right style? 

* The heel tab should stick out very high on the back

**Jordan 9**

* Does the material around the back and bottom of the shoe have a shiny reflective material? Should it?  

* Are the triangles indented in? They should be 

* The 23 should be very thick on the back

* Does the heel tab go up to the correct height? Check some pictures for the right height.

**Jordan 10**

* Is the correct amount of toe box present? The laces need to start pretty early on the shoe

* The wording on the tongue should be indented

* The pattern on the inside of the shoe should be right. If it’s supposed to be a checker pattern

**Jordan 11**

* Is the carbon fiber actually carbon fiber? Is it the right color? This is the #1 way to tell if 11’s are fake. Fake factories don’t use real carbon fiber they use plastic.

* Is the cut of the patent leather right? does the patent leather have little triangles on the edges? If there are triangles they’re fake

* Is the spacing on the 23 right

* Does the tag on the tongue read “Jumpman Jordan”? It should. The tag should also be in the 3rd space between the laces.

* Are the laces thick? Real Jordan 11’s have very thick rope laces

**Jordan 12**

* Are they made with the right kind of leather? Almost all 12’s are made with tumbled leather

* The texture on the mudguard and the midsole section below it should be the same. It’s a kind of scaly pattern. 

* The edge of the mudguard should also be the edge of the Jumpman plastic tab and the section of the sole that comes up. If they’re not lined up they’re fake.

* The back tab should be readable and slept correctly. If you can’t read it clearly it’s fake or you have bad eyesight. The tab should also go pretty high

**Jordan 13**

* The pattern on the side should have stitches around every “hole” they shouldn’t be pressed in. There’s several stitches to each hole

* Does the shoe have 3M stitched in. Should it? The Bred’s and All but the 2010 Flints should

* Is the hologram actually a hologram? If it doesn’t have a 3D feel to it

* Does the jumpman have a circle around it on the tongue? If it does they better be the playoffs. 

* Is the Jordan tab on the end of the tongue and beginning of the front of the shoes the right color? Look up the shoe you’re trying to buy and check. 

* Does the tongue come up high? It should

**Lebron 8**

* The tab on the back of the shoe shouldn’t be white

* The Lebron signature shouldn’t have any loops that are filled in

* The nubuck around the laces should have a pattern on it for the South Beach’s

* The laces should have Lebron’s signature on the aglets 

* The panels should be made of the right material

**Lebron 9**

* Does the back tab stick straight out? It shouldn’t. The tab should go upwards

* Is the stitching on the base of the back tab visible through the plastic plate on the back? If it is they’re fake

* On the Elite 9’s

**Kobe 6**

* The scales on the shoe should go from the bottom of the shoe all the way to the top

* Kobe 6's come in a box with scales on it

* The swoosh ends roughly at the 3rd lacehole

* The tongue on the Kobe 6 only comes out slightly past the top of the shoe. If it's too far look out for that

* The signature on the back starts very off center

**KD 4**

* The KD logo's on the back of each shoe should tilt downwards towards the inside of the shoe

* The swoosh should start on the back of the shoe and go around the edge to the side

* The inside of the strap should say Adaptive Fit

* If something is supposed to be 3M

* Make sure the tongue says 3-4-5 not just 3-5

* Make sure the sole says the right things in the right places

* If the shoe has an XDR tag

**Basic Statistics**

Total number of responses: 872

Out of 6


**[Gender Graph](http://i.imgur.com/pHGrUkV.png)**

Male: 849

Female: 22

Did not respond: 1

Something I suspected



**[Age Graph](http://i.imgur.com/0jsPKVR.png)**

Under 13: 8

14-18: 394

19-23: 301

24-28: 104

29-35: 49

Over 35: 14

Did not respond: 2

Again something I suspected is that most of the responses came from those in the high school and college age range



**[Ethnicity Graph](http://i.imgur.com/0Jet9h8.png)**

Damn
516 answered strictly white while 52 included white in their answer. 
That is over 65% white for those who responded.
Other includes answers that had only one response
like mixes of several different answers and others.

My favorite response to this answer was ""Black



**[Map of Countries represented](http://i.imgur.com/JjanTUC.png)**

I received 862 responses from 24 different countries. The United States of 
America had the highest number of responses at 712. The second closest was
Canada at 67. [Here is a graph of responses
(http://i.imgur.com/PWEz021.png)

**[Map of States with Number of Responses](http://i.imgur.com/KKAIS6i.jpg)**

47 States and Washington DC are represented here
and New Mexico
The least represented states were Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, 
New Hampshire

[Alphabetical list of the states and the
number of responses received.](http://i.imgur.com/PBhLgnw.png) 

**Sports**
-----

The most popular sport
 and I am not going to list them all so here is a [list of all responses.](http://i.imgur.com/Qdd5Bnq.png)
 
Some of my favorite responses not in the list were ""Sometimes I throw food and 
catch it in my mouth""
""none I'm fat"" and ""smoking weed and fucking bitches"" and my least favorite was 
""none you fucktard"" I didn't understand the hostility
 what they do for a job was to ""wank"" so I didn't take it too seriously. 

**[How much do you make Graph](http://i.imgur.com/XxLPET1.png)**

There are a lot of broke motherfuckers round here. The majority of us make less 
than $5
question to kind of gage if these responses were serious based on the age and I
 also wanted to see how many pairs of shoes these people making so much money had.
 There are quite a variety of jobs, or
the food industry. Which makes a lot of sense based on the age groups. After those 
the second most prevelant jobs were in engineering or devlopment/IT jobs. There 
were a few doctors and lawyers out there though. Quite a few people who ""hustle"" 
for a living too.

Those who made $100
4 and 30.  The person who owned the most pairs of 450+ makes between $40
$70
more cross analyzation between those 3 stats and probably make a post about it later.



-----



**Sneaker Statistics**


**[Shoe Size Graph](http://i.imgur.com/L2Nmdf1.png)**

There were 757 total responses to this question and the most numerous shoe size 
was 10.5 with 110
size 11 with 104 responses. 

**[Number of Pairs Graph](http://i.imgur.com/2FSzMrW.png)**

This was kind of an open ended question apparently but there was quite a big range
 of responses. Most people had under 100 pairs but there were a few people who
 at least said they had more. And I would love to see a collection pic from the
 guy with over 450!
  
**[Years ""In the sneaker game"" Graph](http://i.imgur.com/VucmBh6.png)**

Sorry for the stupid wording
it like this to purposefully be kind of ambiguous. To me this meant how long I have
 been ""collecting"" or buying shoes
 an interest or love for sneakers. Most people here responded with less than 3 years.
 With a majority of people being less than a year. 

 P.S. This graph was bitch to make
data but I couldn't figure out how to make this damn graph in Excel.

**[Favorite Brand Graph](http://i.imgur.com/EwJVzt7.png)**

The clear favorite of this subreddit is Nike (I included Nike SB too) at 518. 
In a kind of close second was Jordan with 256. Vans
were all a pretty close third. With various other brands getting some love.

**[Where you buy your shoes graph](http://i.imgur.com/jIbav67.png)**

There was quite a variety but the most popular place was Nike - online
or outlet - with 160
 not far behind with 121. I was pleasantly surprised with how many of you shop
 at local shops
 
**[Resellers Graph](http://i.imgur.com/18zbmqI.png)**
 
The responses to this question kind of surprised me. I knew there would me more
 negative feelings than positive
be neutral
being neutral to resellers
about 8% liking or loving resellers. 

**Grails**
-----
Damn
the script I wrote didn't work at all for this
you can be on the lookout for one or two more data posts from me.


-----


Well thank you all for the responses
well maybe I will do another one in a few months and we can get a lot more responses 
and better structured questions so the data is easier to process.

They are a legit re-seller and help with trades. They only charge $20 per person to do the trade for you. They have many references and are even acknowledged by [Complex Kicks](http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2013/04/20-legit-sneaker-re-seller-sites-you-should-check-out/trusted-kicks). 

If you're wanting to trade with someone in another state and want to play it safe just dish out the 20 bucks so you know it's secure. MANY people get scammed by just getting bricks in the mail or nothing at all. 

NEVER agree to ship first unless you know the guy yourself. I see this happen a lot to many people from reddit and outside of it. There are many scum bags out there who will do and say whatever they want to land a pair of kicks or just money. 

There are other methods to trade without being scammed as well such as paying each other the equal amount of money via paypal, I just know these guys have a lot of references and are legit. I'm not affiliated with these guys at all but just want all you guys to know there are options so no one gets scammed.

***

First

&gt;...which are also called shoestrings, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.

***

**Materials**

* Cotton shoelaces are the most common. This basic lace comes standard in most shoes found in retail outlets. Cotton laces wash more easily and are less expensive than other choices. 
Elastic shoelaces are growing in popularity. These laces have a circular piece at the end that the wearer can tighten
including leather and Kevlar. These laces work well in boots when something stronger than cotton or elastic is needed.

**Sizes**

* Children's laces come as small as 12 inches. Adult laces tend to begin at 24 inches. The exact length needed depends on the number of eyelets
as the size of the space between the eyelets and the curvature of the shoe.

* The length of a shoelace will be dependant on many factors such as the size of the shoe, [here](http://i.imgur.com/bMyqpBv.jpg) is a basic guide to the lenth of laces needed in regards to the the number of eye holes.


**Shape**

* Shoelaces come either [flat](http://i.imgur.com/SnNV5TD.jpg) or [round](http://i.imgur.com/e4UVlc7.jpg). The flat laces often hold the tie better

**Aglets**

* An [aglet](http://i.imgur.com/vdftqs4.jpg) is the metal or plastic piece on the ends of a lace. This prevents the fraying of the laces. Although people usually never have a problem with plastic aglets

**Accessories**

* [Shoelace covers](http://i.imgur.com/OBSek18.jpg): Shoelace covers protect the laces

* [Lace-locks](http://i.imgur.com/VXsZhIo.jpg): hold laces together

* [Shoelace tags (deubré)](http://i.imgur.com/LC0zRaf.png): with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed.

**CLEANING**

**Method 1:** *Hand Cleaning Method*

Supplies:

* Two platsic cups
* Water
* Soap
* Brush

Steps:

1. Soak laces in warm water for about 5 minutes.

2. Remove laces and rub your cleaner/detergent of choice into the laces.

3. Add cleaner/detergent to the water.

4. Put the laces in the water and give them a vigorous shake/stir.

5. Remove laces and use the brush to scrub. This is what will clean your laces so take your time doing this. Make sure to get both sides!

6. Put laces back into the water and shake/stir again. (Repeat steps 5 &amp; 6 until clean)

7. Remove laces and rinse with running water OR shake in clean water to clean off the cleaner/detergent.

8. To dry

9. Let air dry. If you want to get fancy


**Method 2:** *Washing Machine Method*

Supplies:

* A washing machine (duh!)

* Detergent

Steps:

1. Put your laces into the washing machine

2. When done

***

**Where do I buy shoelaces?**

Well, etc all usually carry as pretty good selection. I've looked for laces at department stores such as Target and Walmart but they generally don't have a great selection.

However

[**Laced Up Laces**](http://www.laceduplaces.com/)

* Unique patterns and colors. They stock galaxy style laces

[**Fully Laced**](http://www.fullylaced.com/Shoelaces)

* Great site

[**Finishline**](http://www.finishline.com/store/shop/accessories/shoe-laces/_/N-1sb9nZ1sb9d)

* Good for athletic laces.

[**Mr. Lacy**](http://www.mrlacy.com/)

* They have just about everything you'll need


[**Shoe Lace Express**](http://www.shoelacesexpress.com/catalog.asp)

* Carries a ton of stuff in all kinds of colors and prints including team prints (NFL

[**Amazon**](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=shoe+laces)

/r/Sneakers' resident Roshe expert here.

The Roshe Run was first released last March, Nike Running locations, and very select boutiques, and there was absolutely no hype to begin with. The original release brushed up against the big sneaker websites, and the shoe's minimalistic design gained the interest of a few people. As more and more people gained interest, the word began to spread about how excellent the Roshe model really was, between the minimal styling, excellent colorways, so the remaining stock was shipped off to Nordstrom Rack locations across the US, nearly all the Roshes from Nordstrom Rack had grateful owners

This brings us to the most recent releases, which had a Tonal mesh upper, swoosh, and sole, but with a contrasting medial midpanel and swoosh. Today, we anxiously await the release of the first set of *new* colorways since the original 7 to feature the original mesh. The Squadron Blue, Tarp Green,"" and Black/Gamma Grey colorways are all set to drop in the next few weeks

**To answer your question**, excellent original colorways, and unbelievable comfort that has brought the Roshe to what it is today. If you're curious, head to your local FootAction store and pick up a pair, but be careful, they're addictive!
