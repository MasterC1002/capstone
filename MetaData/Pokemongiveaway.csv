1355940868.0,154b4g,"[5th] Happy Holidays! To celebrate, we're giving away ~250 Legendaries, Shinies, and Events!",Aunna,14, and link it here. We will be doing pick ups all weekend with just a couple of breaks for us.**

**EDIT: Pick ups [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/15ad9r/5th_pickup_info_for_250_legendary_event_and_shiny/)**


--------------------------------------

Greetings, /u/Perhapsso, and myself have combined forces to put on a massive giveaway! We have about 250 legendaries, shinies, and events to give away! These have all been pokechecked and are not hacks or clones. Please read the instructions completely to ensure that this goes as smoothly as possible.

____________

**General Overview**

Here's a basic rundown of how this will work:

* Sign ups will run for a max of 3 days. Starting when this post goes up

* Pick ups will be Saturday and Sunday the 22nd and 23rd. Anything not picked up by Sunday evening will be forfeited.

* On Saturday morning we will make a new post with a spreadsheet that lists who you are trading with. You will contact them before sunday evening for a pickup. This will be further detailed in the Saturday post.

* What you get will be random. The person trading with you will put up 3 random pokes

* If you get something you didn't want

_____________________

**What we're giving out**

Here's pokecheck boxes with some of what we're offloading:

* [Box 1](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=aunna)
* [Box 2](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=5&amp;u=chill84)
* [Box 3](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=27&amp;u=vegadoo)
* [Ribboned Event Album](http://imgur.com/a/0jioB)

(Note: This is in no particular order. Things will be given out randomly.)

(Note 2: Some of the shinies are RNG'd. This does not mean hacked or cloned. They are still unique and will pass any tournament checks.)
_________________________

**RULES**

* One per person.

* Include both things listed in the ""how to enter"" section.

* Don't ask for something specific.

* Anything not picked up by Sunday evening at 7pm [PST](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/) will be forfeited and saved for another giveaway. No exceptions

_________________________

**HOW TO ENTER**

Leave a response to this post including BOTH the following things:

* Your Friend Code. FLAIR DOES NOT COUNT. This is incredibly important so we can have you already added ahead of time. We need the one off your Pal Pad in game

* Share a story with us about Pokemon from your childhood. If you didn't play when you were little

I just want to clarify on some rules that I see are not being followed.

&gt;Be reasonable. **We shouldn't see any requests for shinies

This rule is followed pretty well, or legendary, please report it or send the mods a message with a link and *why the post is breaking the rules.*

&gt;Any true trades should be in /r/pokemontrades.

and 

&gt;If you are running a giveaway don't ask for anything in return

I see these a bit more than the rest. Please

And the two rules I see broken the most that would make this subreddit infinitely easier to use and just make it look better over all.

&gt;Include in the title of every offer or request the generation game that you are trading on(4th or 5th).

and

&gt;*Also include in the title whether you are Looking for Something or Giving Away (LF or FT)

The rest of the rules are followed pretty well

Again
Thanks

If you made it down here

Edit: An example of a good title for asking 
&gt;[5th] LF: Mudkip! 

/u/dragsharder posted that. Thanks! Its perfect. Simple and conveys everything.

For giving away

&gt;[4th] Giveaway: Eevees

Thanks /u/ALXND3R for that post. Its perfect just like the last one.

BAD examples for asking (don't do this)

3. Aerodactyl. (3) Nature: Hasty. Level 100

* Mewtwo
* Starmie
 
~~The last 3 are just level 1's shiny Staryus. If you want one just request it. You won't have to win if you want one.~~

I've always hated the first come, if you want the Celebi; for example, you have to guess my 2nd favorite Pokemon. If you win 1 of the 3, but DO NOT want the Pokemon you won, just let me know and ask for something else, I'll gladly give you another Pokemon listed. If you guess, let's say

**You have 3 guess!**

**Let me save you the trouble

Edit: Totally forgot my FC. 1077-9912-8798

Edit3: I have to leave. I'll be back in 30-60 mins. ALL Staryus have been claimed! Guys please make all 3 guesses in 1 post

Edit4: I'm back and ready to trade!

Edit5: **OKAY THIS IS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME. PLEASE PLEASE CTFL+F THE POKEMON YOU'RE GOING TO GUESS. IF YOU DO NOT AND GUESS A POKEMON THAT'S ALREADY BEEN GUESSED YOU WILL LOSE THE GUESS**

Edit6: **To the people that won and haven't claimed their Pokemon. You HAVE to pick it up by tonight OR PM me to let me know when you can pick it up. If you don't it will be given away by Midnight (Central Time) So you have 5 hours.**

Edit8: **The Mewtwo and Starmie are now up for grabs. Just ask if you want it and it's yours.**

Thanks for the stories everyone, **please read the instructions very carefully** to ensure this goes as smoothly as possible!


You will have from when this post goes up until 7pm [Pacific](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/) Sunday evening to contact someone regarding pickup. No exceptions. We will try to finish remaining trades that have contacted us before taking off

-------------------

**Step 1: Find who you are assigned to**

~~* Check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgDhiI0miLhcdEJBRFZYRkljcURLT0luNThUd2h4a3c#gid=0) for your reddit name. Ctrl-f is your friend. Also

~~* The colored name at the top of the column you are in is who you are trading with. Add the friend code up there. It should be /u/Aunna, or /u/nbomber.~~

**Step 2: Contact**

~~* We will have some friend codes pre-added. Before trying to contact us, please finish reading this section first. I believe perhapsso and chill84 already have everybody added, and I will be posting who I have added in the comments.~~

~~* It is your job to contact the person you are assigned to. You can send them a message directly from their user page linked above

~~* When you contact them

~~* Our online status will be posted in comments below. If you could throw an upvote at those for visibility

~~* nbomber has graciously offered to assist us with distribution

**Step 3: Trading**

~~* When we are ready to trade with you, and select ""trade"".~~

~~* Please be patient and wait for us to try to connect to you. **Do not try to connect to us unless we have contacted you first.** Use the PC. We have a large amount of trades to do

~~* Please don't trade us eggs. A patrat is totally ok.~~

---------------------------

**Troubleshooting/Connection Problems**

* If the connection is saying ""Failed to respond"" please leave the trade room and re-enter. Upon re-entry

* If we leave the room without trading with you

* If you frequently Pokecheck things

* Still having problems? Try hopping into the chat linked in the sidebar of /r/pokemontrades. Chances are one or all of us will be hanging around there and it is much faster than reddit messages.

----------------------

Please remember that this is a random giveaway. You will be shown 3 pokemon and can pick from that

Ok so I'm restarting my pokemon white game for a nuzlocke run(because I'm probably not getting x and y when it comes out for I don't want to buy a 3DS just yet). I've collected quite a bit of pokemon and items on my trip through unova and I'm proud of my collection(although it's not every single pokemon). I don't just want to delete this game and get rid of them all. so here's what I'm going to do. on 1/14-1/16 I will be in my public library(which is the only place I can use the internet since ours is stupid) from probably noon to 5pm. If you want ANY of these pokemon or items just ask. If someone has already asked for it shucks for you. I will also be giving away my team if anyone wants that. Here are the pokemon I'm giving away(no levels or natures unless asked). Also I'm jst listing ones that are hard to get or impossible to get in either of the games(or its pre-evolved form needed a stone or something). if you need another pokemon that is not listed and I may have just ask.

MAJOR EDIT: LOOK FOR YOUR NAMES BESIDE THE POKEMON YOU HAVE ASKED FOR. IF IT IS THERE THEN IT IS YOURS TO GET IN TRADE. IF IT IS NOT AND SOMEONE ELSE'S IS THERE THAT MEANS THEY HAVE ASKED BEFORE YOU. SORRY AND HAVE A NICE DAY! ALSO IF I DID NOT SEE YOUR REQUESTS FOR POKEMON I'M SORRY. THERE WERE PRETTY MUCH WHAT FELT LIKE A HUNDRED APPEARING EVERY TIME I HIT THE MAIL THING. SO IF I DIDN'T SEE YOUR REQUEST I'M SORRY.

 The reason I made this sub is because Contests and Events tend to fall between a gap created by /r/Pokemontrades and /r/Pokemongiveaway so by having a place where contests etc can be - people can avoid breaking rules in either sub by giving away pokemon

 Events are fun. Contests are fun. Pokemon is fun

 If this sounds like something you would be interested in - check us out over at /r/pokemoncontests and see what weekly

 **Edit(TL;DR of sorts) - New sub called /r/pokemoncontests that is where you should head if you are trying to create a contest/event to give away pokemon. Contests *can* include legendaries/shinies/foreign pokemon/IV bred pokemon

 **Hacked Pokemon are NOT allowed in any fashion on this sub. Generated, it is probably not the sub community for you.**

 Thanks as always for being an awesome community and let's hope this makes us even stronger as a whole. Pokemon subs have only things to gain from the inclusion of subs like giveaways and contests.

 Boom.

**HERE IS MY FRIEND CODE BTW =&gt; 2795-8493-8495**

**NOTE A** - CHANGE OF RULES. This is necessary as my Pal Pad suddenly filled up and exploded. Please specify WHICH pokemon you want when you post. This way I add the users of the give aways of THAT hour. Thank you. 

**NOTE B** - Pause and rinse. In order to make sure that the eggs are with who they are supposed to be
 
**NOTE C** - It is getting harder for me to coordinate the eggs due to Family stuff and cooking for X-mas and all of that. I don't want to bother you thinking that I will give out eggs and then not show up. Are you ok if I move it to the 30th? We'll start at 8pm PST.   I also want to have a ""poll"" thread to know what's up with your eggs. Did you get a shiny? The correct Nature? Was your DW pokemon hatched WITHOUT the ability. This will help me in my feedback as I become **THE GREATEST BREEDER OF REDDIT**  

**NOTE D** - HOLY SHIT

**HOW DOES THIS WORK?**

*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* 
  
**RULES**  
  
- You can get up to 3 eggs in this giveaway. However
- When you post
- Any pokemon is fine. Won't judge you if you throw me Patrats or Rattatas.  
- The Starters have been breed with a **GERMAN DITTO** (I have a US cartridge). If the Matsuda method works in your favor
- I will fill my box with eggs. That means there will be **30** eggs of each species. If there's no more
- If you'd like to thank me with something
- I will keep track on each FC to see how many pokemon eggs you get. Any attempt to get more than 3
- **NEW** On regards to DW Pokemon

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution

&gt; Download the .pkm file using the links above and use http://www.pokegts.us/ or [ir-gts-bw](http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/downloads/list) to transfer it to your game.

*The Pokemon I downloaded is fainted and has 0 for all its stats

&gt; You ~~didn't read the rules~~ forgot to make sure you had a full party before entering the GTS.

All of these shinies are legit. These are **not** clones or hacks. I use RNG to obtain them. Pokecheck only flags pokemon as RNG'd if they have four or more perfect IVs. 

------------------------------------------

**Important information:**

* **Post your FC in your reply or you will not be entered in contest. Flair does not count. I must see your FC in your reply!**

* At 3:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) on Friday January 4^th I will stop accepting entries.

* Winners will be chosen at random.

* Winners will be posted in this thread around 5:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) the same day. Winners will also receive a PM.

* Winners my choose their pokemon from the box. First come

* If you win you have 7 days to collect your pokemon.

* If I get 50 entries I will add three random shinies to the box!

-------------------------------------

I have decided to not go with a theme for my shiny giveaways. It takes much less time for me to RNG six of the same pokemon than it does to do six different pokes.

Same deal goes as before though. Suggest a pokemon for next Fridays giveaway. **The first person to suggest the most popular** (according to upvotes and comments) **pokemon for next weeks giveaway will get an RNG'd shiny of that pokemon!**

Also

Please

**Mudkip will be next weeks shiny!** Don't forget to upvote comments that suggest shinies you would like to see next week!

I’d like to get in on this giveaway action. I am giving away one WIN2011 shiny Raikou and one GAMESTP shiny Suicune. Since they have classic ribbons, so their stats/info pages are [here](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=search&amp;vid=&amp;bid=67-49390-24481). Make of that what you will.

This’ll be a simple guess that pokemon contest, using a random number generator and you have to guess what they are. You get one guess per hour, per subreddit—as in, there must be an hour or more between each of your guesses on each subreddit. If you are the winner and have a previous post marked as less than an hour before your winning post, you will be disqualified and I will hold the contest again.

I will be giving out hints every hour on the hour.

For clarification: the pokemon you need to guess is different for each subreddit!

I will respond to you if you have gotten the correct pokemon. So don't think I'm ignoring y'all!

This post is for the Raikou. Head over to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonContests/comments/1btk3y/5th_beasts_event_contest/) for the Suicune! **Suicune has also been won.** Thank you all for a fantastic contest! Nobody ever expects these things to last as long as they do

**HINTS**

HINT 1: It is not a fire type.

HINT 2: It is not a steel type.

HINT 3: It is not a flying type.

HINT 4: It is not a water type.

HINT 5: (I'm back!) It is not a rock type.

HINT 6: It is not a normal type.

HINT 7: It is not a fighting type.

HINT 8: It is not a ghost type.

HINT 9: It is not a bug type.

HINT 10: (Good morning!) It is not a psychic type.

HINT 11: It is not a dragon type.

HINT 12: It is not a poison type.

This means that this pokemon must be electric, ground, or dark type, or a combination of two of those.

**This contest is over!** The correct pokemon was electrode. Congratulations to dr_silver_123 with the win!",,t5_2ub11,1365372438.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/1btkvb/5th_beasts_giveaway/

If no one guesses right I'll go by whoever was the closest or has the funniest name.

Any form of one of my favorites counts.


My FC is 4814 3432 0852. All three will be RNGed to have near perfect iv's and a good nature. I'll also nickname them if you want too. I'm starting to RNG them now so it could take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours for each one so please be patient if I don't have it ready right away. I think that's all so good luck everyone!

* If you are running a giveaway don't ask for anything in return

* Any true trades should be in /r/pokemontrades.

* Any Giveaways of hacked Pokemon must state in the title that they are hacked.

* Include in the title of every offer or request the generation game that you are trading on(4th or 5th). 

I am sure that I have left somethings out but that is what is in place right now and all input is appreciated.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

I'm not someone that is very demanding for my birthday

I don't care what it is, an egg that i have no idea what it contains or your favorite pokemon named after you to give it some spotlight. I'll be making a wallpaper of the ones i get (If i get any) with their name stated if they're named something funny and mails included.  
It would really cheer me up today (Didn't get any presents, the friends that are still here going to meet up and roleplay and I'm not invited) since I'll most likely be playing all day, it'd be the perfect thing. I've got Pokemon Black, Black 2 and Soul silver.

Hey guys! So it turns out my used HeartGold had a lot more to offer from its previous save file than I thought. No more legendaries unfortunately, so if you see that someone has already asked for a pokemon, assume that it is taken unless otherwise stated. I will be crossing off pokemon from the list as they are reserved so keep checking. Three per person, just like last time. My reference page is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1cmo35/benagain1s_reference/), and if you liked these giveaways I'd love if you could write me a reference!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution

&gt; Download the .pkm file using the links above and use http://www.pokegts.us/ or [ir-gts-bw](http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/downloads/list) to transfer it to your game.

*The Pokemon I downloaded is fainted and has 0 for all its stats

&gt; You ~~didn't read the rules~~ forgot to make sure you had a full party before entering the GTS.  Drop your downloaded Pokemon off in the daycare or give it a rare candy and everything will be back to normal.",,t5_2ub11,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/znhrx/5th_rpokemonrng_week_14_giveaway_winner_meloetta/

Just like last time

* During the first part

* Once those pokemon are gone

* Once those eggs are gone

* And, I will be giving away a DWF Bagon OR DWF Lapras to the person who can correctly answer the question that I put up.




Please read the rules carefully:

* Please **pay attention** to what part we are on! Do not ask for something in a part that we have not yet reached. I will be posting when one part is finished, please look for those comments from me as well!

* Adding onto this

* Abbx will be modding this thread for me. So

* This should probably go without saying, since others are waiting on me too.

* Read the limitations, you may only take one from each (ie; one mystery egg, or one breedable).

* If you do not specify what nature or gender of the pokemon that you want from the list

* You are allowed to participate in more than one part. So

* Please do not ask for anything that is not being offered in the giveaway.

* I would also appreciate it if you only took pokemon that you will be using. If you want to take twenty Eevees for whatever unknown reason, try to be considerate and don't take pokemon that you won't use; other people could love them too. One man's trash is another man's treasure, yes?

* Be nice to everyone! We're all friends here. I mean

* All accounts must be at least a month old. There is no multiaccounting allowed either.

* Those that abuse or disobey the rules to a significant level or a good number of times will be banned from the rest of the giveaway. Depending on the offense


**~~PART ONE POKEMON:~~ PART ONE IS OVER!** *These are the pokemon that are still reserved for people.*

* ~~Serious~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW EEVEE)

* ~~male; hardy; volt absorb (DW)~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW PACHIRISU)

* ~~male; hardy; magic guard (DW)~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW ABRA)

* ~~Brave~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW RELICANTH)

* ~~male; calm; weak armor (DW)~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW SLUGMA)

* ~~male; serious; water absorb~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (LAPRAS)

* ~~calm~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW DEERLING)

* ~~male; mild; overcoat (DW)~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW BURMY)

So

As said, but may also involve poking around reddit for the answer. I will provide hints to set you on the right path if I deem it necessary.

**How to enter?** Just post in this thread that you want to enter

**How to answer questions?** Send a private message to me with as title *Contest - Question n* (with 'n' the number of the question) and in the text only the answer. The only exception is that along with your first answer you send in a heartwarming story about pokemon. If you can't think of something

If you answer in this thread

**How to get points?** The first to answer correctly gets 10 points. If you answer within the first 10 minutes after the first correct answer was given to me, you still get 1 point. After a while, I will put the answer in the thread. Obviously, you can't get points for it then. I won't tell you if you're right or wrong and I won't put a score bord up, just to keep in the suspence ;)

**What can I win?** 

The person with the highest score gets my RNG services: you can request any three breedables to your specifications (shiny, ability,...).

Second prize is [this RNG'd (non-shiny) fully EV-trained DWF Bagon](http://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=3355659) (it has 2 extra EV's in attack than the pokecheck says). I have one myself and I assure you: it fucks things up.

Third prize is a pick from any one of [these legendaries](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=7&amp;u=rbhfd). 

As a runner-up prize

That's about it

~~**Question 1**~~ - What were the first games released in each generation and in what year were they released (in Japan)? I'm only asking for the first games of each generation

***Answer question 1:*** can be found [here](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Games). You can now no longer answer question 1.

**~~Question 2~~** - What's my favorite pokémon? I'm not asking you to start guessing randomly

***Answer question 2:*** My favorite pokémon is indeed Umbreon. You could deduced this

~~**Question 3**~~ - About 3-4 months ago

***Answer question 3:*** That awesome user was OrganicOrganics

**Question 4** - This isn't really a question, spin-offs,... I will award points based on originality, whether I would play the game,... with a maximum of 15 points. Since this isn't a real question and I want to award people that put time in to it, all posts will be judged equally, independent of the time of submission. You have time until 5 pm to write this.

~~**Question 5**~~ - I'm not much of a book reader, to read a series of books. They're amazing and would like to recommend them to anyone. I'm looking for the name of the serie, not any of the books. [Hint](http://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=2392209).

***Answer question 5:*** The series is called *A song of Ice and Fire*. And not Game of Thrones

~~**Question 6**~~ - I'm still a student. In July

***Answer question 6:*** I'm now studying mathematics

~~**Question 7**~~ - I used another awesome pokemon I RNG'd for myself. It's adamant and knows Close Combat, **yellow** pokemon!

***Answer question 7:*** [here](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/0/03/Spr_5b_448_s.png).

~~**Question 8**~~ - I mentioned earlier that Tyranitar (in my White game) was my first shiny. This isn't however exactly true

***Answer question 8:*** Obviously, since I just had a Gameboy, not Color.

~~**Question 9**~~ - What country am I from. I have stated it in some of my posts

***Answer question 9:*** As you could see from the link that says at which time zone I'm in

~~**Question 10**~~ (last question) - An easy one to finish

***Answer question 10:*** Bug, Electric, Fighting, Fire, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ice, Rock

*****
To celebrate the two patriotic holidays of this past week

If you can guess one of the Pokémon I RNG'd

*****
Because I only had time to RNG abuse 4 Pokémon for this week's giveaway

*****
Rules:  
 - You can guess one Pokémon and one number between 1 and 25 once every half hour.  
 - You can only win one Pokémon per giveaway
 - If you are guessing for the second time make a new comment
 - You have to guess the exact stage of evolution
 - Please don't delete your guess if it is wrong. This makes it easier to keep track of how long ago you last guessed.
 - Hints will be added every hour

*****
Hints:  
- All of the Pokémon remind me of either the United States of America or Canada.  

*****
Winners:  
 - /u/Lucifiaro won Braviary
 - /u/A_O_A_B won Snorlax!  
 - /u/PokeMaverick won Bibarel
 - /u/cerulean_octopus2 won Bibarel with the number 4!  
 - /u/pokeyman71 won Abomasnow!  
 - /u/ihavethekey5 won Eevee with the number 2!  
 - /u/trettet won Rufflet with the number 19!

*****
If you can think of another theme (like *Murica vs. Canada, I’ll give you an RNG’d breedable Pokémon of your choice! If you have any other suggestions or things I should do differently next time, you should send me a PM or tell me in the comments.  

To everyone who sent me a PM about a future theme last week
