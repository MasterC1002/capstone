and during this time Powerline has been rewritten in Python and loads of 
new features have been added (shell prompts
aiming for a release pretty soon
guys before finally bringing the plugin out of beta.

1. **Documentation.** [The docs](http://lokaltog.github.com/powerline/) 
   are fairly detailed already
   to write a comprehensive guide for many different configurations myself. 
   It would be awesome if you guys could help out with the docs (in 
   particular the installation and configuration guides on OS X and 
   Windows). I know that many users are still having issues even when 
   they're following the existing guides
   improvements are greatly appreciated.
2. **Third-party plugin support.** We've been having a [long discussion 
   regarding this](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues/3)
   proper third-party plugin support still haven't been implemented. In 
   this version of Powerline we won't include any third-party statuslines 
   in the main repo
   support in their repos. We'd love some input from other plugin authors 
   on how you would prefer to include Powerline support. See the discussion 
   on GitHub for more details.
3. **Patched fonts.** I'm hoping that we'll be able to remove the font 
   patcher soon
   fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts). I can't maintain 
   the powerline-fonts repo myself
   font that looks good
   Note that font patching is no longer required for most Linux users
   but OS X and Windows users still need patched fonts.
4. **Testing.** Since there's so many different vim configurations 
   out there
   think the plugin looks interesting
   submitting any issues with the plugin to the issue tracker on GitHub: 
   https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues

Please let me know what you guys think about the plugin in general
could be improved. If you have any code or documentation improvements

* Replace VimScript with LuaJit (or V8). Additionally, Ruby etc. bindings. This creates a uniform environment for scripts, and hopefully some reusable and open APIs. Currently the amount of reuse between plug-ins is absolutely minimal, especially compared to that other editor.

* The cursor is placed before or after a character, ve=onemore and so on.

* Standard plug-in and package management. Vim already has a script 'repository'

* Background processing for some tasks. Vim is single threaded, or run :make while I continue to edit.

* Now goes to 11

The majority of bugfixes were relatively trivial and I am pretty confident to label this release as stable. I do use it on a day-to-day basis

External snips is the biggest new thing. It's basically the ability to link an external file to one of your tasks when you need to provide explanation or take notes (which I've used it for).

You set up a directory where you want snips to be saved, but I personally use ""markdown"").

When you open your task list later on you can just press enter on the snip placeholder and the snip will open for you. It's pretty handy. In the interest of keeping Quicktask light and quick

I just save my to-do list and accompanying ""snips"" folder in my Dropbox and use some switches in my .vimrc to change the path based on which environment I'm in since I use a Mac

You can check out the homepage at http://quicktask.aaronbieber.com or go straight to the github page at https://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask.

Any and all feedback welcome. If you find a bug you can send me a message on reddit or open an issue on github. Better yet,False,,t5_2qhqx,False,,,t3_1530ce

1343708840.0,xfl4b,I never understood how anyone used terminal vim until I found Lucius,dddbbb,63,22,76,"*(I recognize that `:colorscheme` is a personal thing

I've always found terminal vim to be something that's only suitable for quick commit messages or editing during a remote session. Aside from the quirks of whatever terminal emulator I was using (like ctrl-s -- which is more a lack of knowledge on my part)

I picked up the [Lucius colorscheme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2536) from that ""what colorscheme is this clojure code"" reddit post

Then I fell down the rabbit hole of getting more colors in my terminal with this [vim tip](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim) (look for the script that comes after ""to catch gnome-terminal and automatically set the TERM correctly for xterm""). After doing that

It wasn't too stark with too much contrast in some places and not enough in others like candycode look to basic like wombat and other schemes that don't live up to their gui beauty in the terminal.

Explanation:

 * `xmap`  and `xnoremap` declare a mapping in visual mode only (`vmap` would also work in select mode and this is just not right).
 * `&lt;expr&gt;` makes the right-hand side of the mapping an expression that is evaluated when the mapping triggers.
 * So we remap `p` in visual mode. Since `p` and `P` had the same effect in visual mode
 * We are no-op if the currently active register is not the default register (`v:register == '""' ? … : 'p'`).
 * When it is the default register
 * The default behaviour of `p` in visual mode would be that the selected area is replaced with the contents of the selected register. And

As you guys can see it's not just a few milliseconds we're talking here...

It turns out that my slow vim was due to a plugin called: vim-css-color. Here is a quote for a github issue about this problem.

 &gt; This only applies to 256-color terminal vim, however, the s:Xterm2rgb function is required for converting RGB values to appropriate color codes. Because it's implemented with a loop scanning all 255 colors for the closest match, and repeated ~150 times, once per e.g. s:SetNamedColor('#40E0D0','Turquoise') call, it takes awhile.

This is easily remedied by downloading and installing a fork of this plugin by another developer.

After much begging I agreed to see what I can do. Additionally we do in-house ""fun"" information sessions for which we get around 45 minutes. I decided this would be a good candidate.

But 45 minutes to explain vim is *extremely* short. So I am currently struggling with the selection of ""essential"" and ""cool"" things you can do with vim.

So far, insert and visual as they are most useful for beginners. Also explain the ""verb-noun"" nature of the vim commands. It makes many things easier to understand later on.

As a ""cool"" feature I'd like to demonstrate the following: 
 
* command repetition using the ""dot-command"".
* folding
* splits
* tabs
* macros (if there's still time)

I also want to mention ""customization"". As in my opinion

So far

Problem is

I'd like to have a way to use my good old vim with all my nice plugins and see in another window at the same time the result of a markdown to html conversion.

I was thinking of writing a python script that would monitor the vim swap file and render some html on the fly based on the result of a markdown conversion.

Now the problem I have is:
 - How do I exactly parse the vim swap file? I haven't seen any documentation on how it's built
 - More generally is there any other way for an external program to monitor (read only) what's happenning within a vim buffer and take actions depending on it? Also

This is not a plugin you should be using. This was a personal code challenge based on something I saw a user do in an emacs video

**The Problem**

So I was watching an ""Emacs Rocks!"" video, and it turns out that the guy who made [AceJump-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump) was initially inspired by two Vim plugins that do similar things, namely [EasyMotion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526) and [PreciseJump](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3437), both of which have animated demos.

**The Challenge**

Before looking to see if there was a Vim equivalent, *then* researched, and of course found out it exists in multiple forms. No worries; it was all for the learning. I figured I'd share my code here, though. It's heavily commented for your learning enjoyment.

**The Code**

[Here it is](http://pastebin.com/vJek9vvW) (**updated**: no longer needs incorrectly-named GetASCII() function (removed - thanks to romainl for the pointer to nr2char()), and sans comment and blank lines, the actual work of the function is only 61 lines of Vimscript, all in a single function. Not bad.

**Description/usage**

There are 2 lines above the function to define highlights (dark gray and dark red, followed by a single letter. It uses the `\&lt;` beginning-of-word bound to only search for words starting with your search letter, but you can play with that.

**Caveats**

I learned after researching that the other scripts, they first group the screen into chunks of all ""a"" and ""b"" etc jumps, then after you choose one of those, it fills in all the jump characters for just that area, and you press another letter to complete the jump. That wasn't in the video I watched, and it didn't occur to me while writing it (though running out of jump characters certainly did, and is handled in my script by simply not adding jumps for those)

I also didn't think at the time of coding about using this as a motion

**Learnings**

`\%23l` and `\%52c` in Vim regex lock matches to line 23 and column/character 52 respectively. These are handy. I was initially using a range over `line('w0')` through `line('w$')` and `join`ing with parts of those to build up a massive regex to grey out the lines on the screen, store up match points, and later come back and do things to them. You can do something like `\%3c.*\%27c` to match a section on a line, or `\%10l\_.*\%20l` to match those full lines, or even `\%13l\%7c\_.*\%20l\%12c` to match a stream-select-like chunk from line/col 13,7 through line/col 20,12

To undo all the junk the script does, replacing all the letters with their jump equivalents, but it seems a single undo undoes it all. Hopefully that always works. I looked a little into the undo helps, with undoj[oin] and the branch stuff, etc., but couldn't find anything very helpful. I long ago wrote into a function an undo-waypoint system, wherein I could run a waypoint function that did nothing, looking at the undo history to find it

1) Save a text file with this content:

    This is the first line.

    This is the third line.

2) If you do ""ggVGy"" to yank all lines and paste them with your cursor somewhere in line 2

    This is the first line.
    This is the second line.
    This is the first line.    // pasted
    This is the second line.   // pasted
    This is the third line.    // pasted
    This is the third line.

The three lines were not pasted inline.

3) Now exit Vim without saving. Reopen the file in Vim. Put your cursor somewhere in line 2 and paste the lines again (they are still yanked*). This time you should get something like this:

### Some questions

* Is there a binding for copying the URL of the site you're on? I've been manually highlighting the status bar. 
* What's the fastest way to get around the same dozen sites you visit?
* Autocomplete for URLs always ranks the root domain `domain.com` behind URLs like `domain.com/profile/abba4life` even though I go to domain.com every time and have been to abba4life's profile like once. Doesn't it get this data from history? I'd prefer if the root domain was always first.

So I am considering volunteering to develop one or two one-hour tutorial sessions on using vim. To most of these users, one co-worker would hit Esc after *every* command when not in insert mode. *Every* command, other than movement.) However, I am not a vim expert. I use vim regularly, but I also use emacs (and jEdit and whatever I feel is the best tool for the file-type I am working on to be). I have a [modest vimrc](https://github.com/rjray/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/.vimrc), but I'll admit that there are parts of it I've cribbed from elsewhere and don't completely understand.

So I come to ask advice: If you had just one or two hours to introduce good vim practice to a mostly neophyte audience

* Our language for QA automation is Perl
* Clean coding (well- and consistently-indented code) is a **major** issue with these developers
* Basic vimrc content
* Efficient movement

I *don't* want to get into plugins or VimScript (yet), and I'm tired of indentation all over the spectrum, inconsistent use of tabs vs. spaces, no alignment to speak of, etc. (I also plan to do a series of basic Perl sessions to drill in some better coding habits, but those I can handle.) I think that if I can get them to be better utilizers of vim (and completely off of Notepad++), that will at least be a step in the right direction.

Context here:

&gt; Prospective memory holds reminders to perform future actions in specific circumstances e.g. to buy milk on the way home from work (PM).

&gt;Various studies have described how developers have tried to cope with prospective memory failures. For example, developers may intentionally leave a compile error to ensure they remember to perform a task (Parnin:10). A problem with compile errors is that they inhibit the ability to switch to another task on the same codebase. Finally, developers also do what other office workers do: leave sticky notes and emails to themselves (Parnin:10).

Important part here:

&gt; A smart reminder is reminder that can be triggered based on conditions such as a teammate checking in code

I've never made a vim plugin but this does seem like a good productivity booster. It seems like the best way to go would be to work with TODO text already present in comments and allow a way to specify what the triggers are.

The parts I'm not too clear about (since I've never understood a line of vimscript in my life) are:

* how do I go about checking for 'TODO' in a file upon save?
* how do I go about looking for extra options in a line beneath it (e.g. trigger on ':qa')?
* how do I then display the smart comment in its context

There's more I'd like to do but I imagine if I knew how to do all of that I could probably do most of everything else I wanted to do.

Here's [vim-projectroot](https://github.com/dbakker/vim-projectroot) which is a plugin which might be useful to you. It detects the project root folder of files and allows you to use that in combination with other scripts/mappings. Some mappings I've been using with it are:

    nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;dp :ProjectRootCD&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; ]f :ProjectBufNext 'F&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; [f :ProjectBufPrev 'F&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;ef :exe 'CtrlP' ProjectRootGuess(""'F"")&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;F9&gt; :ProjectRootExe NERDTreeFind&lt;cr&gt;

You're probably wondering about the `ProjectBufNext 'F`; well instead of using a filename it is also possible to reference a filemark! When you're working on a project but have a ton more buffers open it would normally be annoying to use `:bnext` to try to get to that specific buffer but not now! Just mark some file with `mF` and can use `[f` and `]f` to navigate between project buffers only.

Not that bad - but what I learned is that vim's errorformat does not like disruptions when you start a multi-line block. I had issues with not picking up information even though if I switched from a continuation (`%C`) to a new error (`%{A,I}`), it appeared as extra errors (that is, the pattern was successfully matching).

Most examples of multi-line errorformat strings usually end with `%-G%.%#` - this tells vim to ignore non-matching lines. What I discovered is that this *breaks* the multi-line group parsing, for the current error.

This introduces another problem: before the error is declared, add the customary `%-G%.%#` on the very end and non-multi-line messages will be completely ignored. So, this ends up looking something like (I took out the inner error format sections):

    let &amp;efm = '%AFAILURE:%.%#,%C\&gt;\ %m,%ZFAILED,%-C%.%#,%-G%.%#'

vimrc file or by adding plugins and costumizing these plugins.
The problem is lately the startup time of vim has gone up to sometimes about
2 or 3 seconds (it has become emacs :) ).
If I am going to be editing a file for a long time this is fine but for a quick
edit to fix something this is not pleasant.

My solution now is the folowing:

define an alias:
    alias v='vim -u $HOME/.vim/simple.vim --noplugins'

simple.vim has the basic settings and loads some plugins that I feel I really 
need: 

    set nocompatible
    syntax on 
    map &lt;f4&gt; :x&lt;cr&gt;
    map &lt;f1&gt; :wa&lt;cr&gt;
    set backspace=2
    set laststatus=2

    ""load eventual plugins here (the ones that would be really necessary)
    let g:p0 = split(&amp;runtimepath
    exec ""source"" . g:p0 . ""/plugin/NERD_commenter.vim""


Note that some of the plugins install files in the folder ftplugin and 
these files will be sourced when you open a file of that type.
This might result in some errors because the commands defined in these files
would have to be defined in the corresponding plugin file
because of the --noplugins flag.
The solution I am using now is to use pathogen. I created a folder d in bundle
and moved the ftplugin folder to bundle/d.
In my regular vimrc file it calls pathogen so everying works file and for this
simple.vim call it also works fine.

Let me know if you have an alternative solution that might be better than this.

1365265490.0,1bsuy7,Subvim: A Vim modification that brings/aims ST2 like features and shortcuts,farslan,36,20,34,"Hi everyone.

I've started a new project that aims to bring/emulate ST2 like features for Vim(MacVim currently). I've started it because I really like Vim and ST2 too. And lots of people try to emulate it. Vintage mode is not much powerful and fast like bare vim. 

But there are to much modifications some has to make in order to make vim really like st2. Thus I've included some pre-compiled binaries

Subvim has really nice features and the same shortcuts like ST2:

* `cmd + p` -&gt; Goto Anything...
* `cmd + r` -&gt; Goto Symbol on  current file...
* `cmd + k` -&gt; Show side bar 
* `cmd + /` -&gt; Toggle comment
* `cmd + [` -&gt; Indent 
* `cmd + ]` -&gt; Unindent
* `cmd + &lt;number&gt;` -&gt; Jump to tab 1
* `cmd + alt + left` -&gt; Move to next tab
* `cmd + alt + right` -&gt; Move to previous tab

and so on .. and features like:

* SublimeText like colorscheme
* On the fly ""Goto symbol,Coffeescript, Objective-C and Markdown are supported. No need to install externalplugins or binaries.
* Full featured autocompletion via YMC. No need to compile the YCM plugin
* Restore latest state (tab
* Automatic closing of quotes
* ... many other fixes and improvements.

It's currently not finished and there are many things that needs to be implemented. It's not aimed for vim-only users. It's just a niche for people that want to migrate from st2 to vim or for people that loves vim but want sublime like editing.

Anyone who thinks it's a good project is welcome to test and contribute :)

I think there are four core bits:

* syntax highlighting
* code navigation (jump to definition
* completion
* build support (converting error messages and callstacks into quickfix locations)

For me this means:

* Getting a syntax file if (shock!) vim didn't come with one.
* ctags and cscope for almost all of my code navigation
* Finding a decent completion plugin. For languages it supports, finding files, syntax checking from within Vim). Since I already have Eclipse open for debugging, I don't mind the weight.
* I usually have to write my own compiler script to get builds working. I rarely find compiler scripts (see `:help :compiler`) and often people set them up to just check syntax instead of running from vim and parsing the callstack. Figuring out the efm is my least favourite part (I've never actually used scanf

After I've got the basics (and I'm still enjoying working in the language)

* Mapping K to pull up language-specific documentation.
* Adding folding to the syntax file. (My default foldmethod is indent
* Interactive behavior with a [slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) or [screen](https://github.com/ervandew/screen) plugin to inject your code in a REPL running in a screen session.
* Auto-running unit tests ([like autonose](https://github.com/gfxmonk/autonose)). These tend to be super-language specific and the most integration I would do is a compiler script for their output. Also

If I only have a single file (buffer) open and "":bd""

So far I've been tediously and annoyingly either working around or fixing the behavior when it happens, in fact, that I would go so far as to say if there isnt a solution to this I now question the astuteness of anyone who uses VIM with NERDTree and doesn't recognize this pitfall as crippling.



**edit:**  To clarify what I mean when I say my approaches have been (unfortunately at the mercy of) ""working around"" or ""preventing"" this behavior here is what I mean:

* If I'm going along my merry efficient way and forget to work around this issue, I simply get a bunch of undefined variable errors the next time I invoke it.  So... what I have to do is this more convoluted and careful approach in which I *use NERDTree filesystem exploration to find a file already in the buffer and open it VIA NERDTree*. This is the only method which allows NERDTree to come back to working order itself.

* By having to always remember to work around NERDTree to avoid the breakage mentioned above, then I can safely delete the buffer with a "":bd"" and then I can bring back NERDTree without it having lost its mind with another ""&lt;leader&gt;n"" and be back to where I wanted to be.
