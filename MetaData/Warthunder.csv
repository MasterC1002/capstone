1364391218.0,1b3x1h,Handy little FAQ!,wokasmasher,173,15,72,"Here I'll try to link or explain the most commonly asked questions I see floating around on this sub.

* **What Joystick do you use/ is best**?

This one pops up a lot, so find something in your price range, do your research and get a tensile sense of the death you are unleashing.

* **Why is my joystick pulling all over the place?**

This was answered nicely by *KamikazeSexPilot* :

It's the torque from your engine. Some aircraft do it more than others, you can see the values in the bottom left when you set it. You can reset it with ""/""
Japanese aircraft are notorious for wanting to pull up
tl;dr **It's the torque from the engine


* **How do I earn money/gain exp faster**?

*MURDER*. Thats really the only answer. You can go premium and get exp/lions faster, but keep in mind they have *vastly* different playstyles than arcade. I recommend you watch the [dogfighting instructional videos]( http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/10709-dogfighting-instructional-videos/) (same as linked on the sidebar) for more murdering tips. You can, on Domination maps, land on the airfields for a cool 2-3k lions. On the subject of landing, should you ever lose your engine and don't want to die a glorious fiery death, you can try to find an open field (or even better, an airfield) and gently set your plane down on it. Try to keep your airspeed under 230 kph (approx 143 mph) and avoid houses and shacks because that is a warcrime. Please note that landing on the enemies airfield will not get you repaired. Its more like ~~plowing his/her sister while looking him/her in the eyes~~ thumbing your nose at the enemy than anything.

* **Whats the difference between all of these ammo types**?

This question should be eliminated by the new patch in-game

I- Incendiary. Burns things

HE- High Explosive. Good against soft targets

AP- Armor piercing. Good against ground targets (not the invincible pillbox) and heavily armored air targets (IL2

T- Tracer. Lets you see where your rounds are going. Almost essential in HB and FRB. As a bonus

Those are the basics, please comment below!

* **Which plane/tree is best**!?

All of the trees excel at certain gametypes and levels. For instance, the Germans get their first BF 109s and Do 217s, and can take on the American Airacobras and A-20s on an equal footing. I cannot cover every plane in every tree, so if you have any questions regarding goodness of planes, feel free to comment below and I'm sure one of the very many helpful Warthunder pilots can help you out.

*Added by Familyengie*
Some clarification of the Russian and Japanese trees which weren't mentioned:
Japanese planes have no armor. Their guns, the rank 2 Ki-43 excels at turnfighting.
Flying with Japan, a 20mm cannon on the rear of each heavy bomber, and the ability to have pretty large payloads. When you get the Zero, you will have fun. The Zeros (minus the navy one) in the game are fantastic. Fast and strong. Still have a lack of armor though.
Russia has flying tanks. The early SU2 does not die and if you can fly evasively, you're going to have fun.
Summary:
Japan has low armor, and very agile. Lousy early and mid tree planes, makes things frustrating.
Russia has high armor, cannons on early fighters, agile bombers, and flying tanks. Strong tree throughout the game, I believe.

* **What should I put crew points in/how do I get crew points**?

I'll go over crews in general here

**Crew Slots**
Each slot represents the folks needed to get a plane up and murdering. Pilot, etc. Each time you buy a plane, the game asks if you want to put it in service. You spend lions to train the crew in the selected slot to operate the plane. This means that while any crew slot can operate any plane, you have to pay for each additional crews training, and noone has the lions to pay for that.
You also have to keep in mind that bombers and the various attackers have gunners chilling in the back

1st Slot: P40 (Fighter)
2nd Slot: SBD Dauntless (Dive bomber)
3rd Slot: PBY Catalina (Tanky Troll Torpedoer)
4th Slot: F2A Buffalo (Fighter)

etc. etc. You'll notice I have 2 bombers



I'll try to give a quick and nasty on the various skills here.

**Pilot Tab**

Keen vision - Lets you identify enemies from a further distance. Most useful in HB.

Visibility - I *think* this is compared to the enemies Keen Vision

G-Tolerance - Points here mean your pilot won't black out from G-forces

*Added by NOACeulemans* G-force tolerance is very important in all three modes. If you push your pilot too hard and pull high-G maneuvers a lot and for extended durations (like during turnfighting or loopings, but that's not the worst part yet. If this happens, your plane will become less agile as your pilot lacks the strength to pull on his flight stick as hard as before. Honestly, among the pilot skills, it's the most important one.

Stamina - I haven't the foggiest

Vitality - How many rounds your pilot can take before becoming an interior paintjob. Again

**Gunner Tab** 

No. of experienced gunners - Absofuckinglutely *imperative* if you have a bomber. A point here means that one gunner (if you have any) will be able to use the points you have put into gunner skills. I do not advise putting points here in a fighter slot.

Fire Accuracy - Affects how accurately your gunners will fire.

Fire Precision - *Not* the same as accuracy. Precise fire with an automatic weapon means short, ammo friendly rate of fire with more points here (standard is 3-5 second burst, or the time it takes to say ""diemotherfuckerdie"")

Not quite sure about G-tolerence, but I put points here anyway, even on a fighter slot, for qualification purposes.

**Ground Service**

Repair Speed - Affects how long it takes to repair your aircraft ingame on an airfield, affects how long it takes after the match ends for your crew to repair the plane for free.

Repair Rank - Each point here corresponds to one tier. For example

Reload Speed - **PUT A SHITTON OF POINTS HERE FOR ARCADE** This corresponds to both in-air (in Arcade) and airfield reloads. Tired of waiting 30 seconds for your murderous death cannon to reload? Skeet your points all over this. 1 minute wait on your bombs? Pointspointspoints. This is, for Arcade mode. It's important in HB amd FRB as well, but arcade is all about putting bullets in faces, and this skill will decrease the time you spend playing pocket-pool.

Healing Speed - No clue. Maybe in a later patch they'll introduce pilot downtime

**Qualification**

Get these. You spend a few thousand (depending on the planes tier) lions to get an instant boost to Keen Vision and Visibility for the Pilot tab, you will have to pay again for the boner-inducing bonus.


* **What in tarnation is up with all of this flap business?; or Flaps: How do they work?**

Answered by *davemanster*. Hurrah! 


Real pilot here
1.Takeoff

* Flaps for normal takeoffs are not used (unless you are in a heavy plane such as a bomber... in real life larger and modern planes use flaps and slats).

* For short field takeoffs some flaps can be used and you rotate just above stall speed and stay at that IAS until the obstacle is cleared. Then slowly bring the nose down/speed up and retract the flaps.This allows for maximum climb over distance.

* Keep in mind for takeoffs using flaps allows your wings to generate more lift

2.Landing

* Flaps may or may not be used in landings

* Flaps might not be used for landings if you have a high crosswind component (flaps allows the wind to affect the wings to a greater degree)

* Landing with no flaps will generally be at a higher IAS, just food for thought)

* In general flaps are used for landings

3.Combat flaps

* Simple; combat flaps increase the lift of your wings, allow you to turn a little sharper. Bear in mind that flaps will increase drag in your airplane decreasing both your acceleration and maximum speed.

* In general, raise them. Parasite drag is really bad for fighters!



I'll continue work on this as I come across more questions, pop it into the comments!

1374030918.0,1igmie,Why Arcade has gone backwards since 1.29,dmh_longshot,135,17,204,"Below is a list of issues that are seriously detracting from Arcade battles. I describe what they do

* Ground Strike ""Gremlins"" (or as the Russians call them, it activates in every Ground Strike game and it happens regardless of whether one or both teams are still flying bombers.  The last dozen or so targets on each team are nearly always destroyed by this script.  Its bad because it deprives bomber pilots of the ability to win the game for their team and earn income, and it makes a mockery of the battle up till that point.  Suggested fix: If this script is necessary, please make it activate only once 10 minutes of gameplay has passed _and_ 3 minutes since the last ground target was destroyed OR airfield bombed.  If a player kills another ground target or bombs the airfield, please disable the script with another 3 minute timer - give players a chance to win the game without the script taking over.

* Domination ticket bleed (introduced in 1.31).  This initially reduced gametimes to 5 minutes or less, the ticket bleed forces an early end.  Is there a need to force  all games to prematurely end like this, and deprive players of the ability to win the mission with desperate last-ditch comebacks against the odds?  If the intent was to force people to fight for the objectives because time's running out, it failed - teams instead race to establish an early lead and then sit back &amp; let the timer do the rest ... Suggestion:  Its not needed, it reduces the fun in the game, please remove it.  Failing that, please make the bleed much slower, put a hard cap of 4 spawns per game to ensure the playing field is level.  Ticket bleed is not a good addition to this game

* Bomb splash radius, which means many bombers are totally unusable as they lack either the speed or agility to survive.  The splash radius may be considered ""historically accurate"", but for gameplay purposes in arcade the nerf has been detrimental.  Fewer bombers in the air has a trickle-down affect on other planes, resulting in gameplay thats less diverse and more slanted towards meaningless dogfights rather than winning the mission.  Suggestion: please restore it to 1.29 levels for arcade battles.

* Bombers &amp; cannon spam.  Over the last few updates, due to cannon reload times fighters that use them are way more effective in AB than fighters with MGs, even though historically some of the MG-equipped fighters were superior because they were a more stable gun platform with a much higher ammo count.  Suggestion: historically cannons had limited ammo and a sharp recoil especially at larger calibers.  Please consider greatly increasing cannon reload times so that these weapons don't dominate all arcade battles, and introduce a much larger recoil such that mouse users have to fight to keep the planes on target.

* This last one isn't new, with minimal lip service rewards for assists etc, or for playing to the misison's objectives.  The economy also rewards ""staying alive"", which is the antithesis of taking risks to win the battle for your team.  The result, as anyone who plays AB can verify, are trains of fighters jostling each other as they chase an isolated enemy.  It rewards selfish behaviour at the expense of your team.  Suggestion: Make assists &amp; criticals worth almost as much as kills, and show assists on the stats board.  In addition, in Domination provide high rewards for rescuing fighters,self,

1363725328.0,1am6ns,Patch 1.29 summed up perfectly on war thunder forums.,keep_digging_watson,147,33,203,"This post was submitted by Aerial_Fury. In it he quotes Osirish and together they sum up the whole of 1.29 quite well. A bit long but worth a look.


Original quote by Osirish:

&gt;""I think that Gaijin need to look at themselves more closely. Who is making these design decisions? Customers, want the game to be fun. Isn't that the reason 99.9% have been playing WT? Gaijin, you want our money, and we'll happily pay if we are having fun and getting value for it. Game developers chose their career paths because they were gamers first. They want to make products that are fun too. Decisions that are made that remove the fun through cynical money grabs is not what customers want, or developers want to see in their games ... so again, who is making the decisions?
 
&gt;I'm an old man. I've been playing games since pong. I was getting jaded and WT gave me back what has been missing from most games in the last 10 years, while there was some grind, it was not beyond someone who was a casual player. There was little that was unachievable for a ftp customer over a premium player except speed of levelling.
 
&gt;I've been playing for a few hours
 
&gt;Why should I give the patch a chance and get used to it if I am not having fun? If it wasn't fun in the first 30 minutes
 
&gt;I don't give a crap about FMs or DMs in arcade mode. Purists and players who like simulations already have two game modes available for them. Casual players have one, then that is exactly the time to whine and QQ about it.
 
&gt;For those who are saying to stop QQing, if you haven't spent money to support the development and infrastructure of the game yet, then why is your opinion more valid than those of us who have, surely it should be the other way around?
 
&gt;Premium is almost a requirement now, but they are not seeing the huge increase in the purchase of new planes, the huge increases in crew training, the increases in cost of ammunition and extra modules that have been added. I don't give a crap about repair costs decreasing by 2000 when my next plane is going to cost 1.5 million, or training the crew to ace is going to cost another million, or equiping it with ammo is going to cost another few hundred thousand. Am I the only one seeing this for what it is?
 
&gt;I own a lot of premium planes. You did one thing right by giving the ""gift"" planes premium bonuses .... but how many have noticed the nerfs on your other premium planes. Planes that were bought for real money to support the game, like the others? If someone buys something that is advertised as one thing and you then take that away after you have received their money .... is that not illegal with most products? Defending this by saying it is just a patch or is a beta is no defence.
 
&gt;Yes, OP Russian planes(ufos),  and the paper bombers were the original complaints ... now we have a whole new set. This does not make patch 1.27 good, it is saying that people would rather play a broken 1.27 than the current 1.29.
 
&gt;Trying to turn arcade mode into more of a realistic simulator is not working. You are removing the fun. Trying to force players into paying money by making it too tough to progress without it
 
&gt;1.29 has made me regret renewing my subscription. The nerfs to premium planes has made me regret buying them too. I play arcade, wonder where you got that idea from?
 
&gt;The gameplay itself ... Handling is much worse for most of the planes I flew today. Most matches are now ending with one side losing all it's aircraft because no one can stay alive long enough to bomb the targets, or how bombers don't seem to have sights at all without using the bomb view. How bomber hunters like the Me410.A are now being out turned and out dived by their prey even when you took out one of their engines on the first pass and they somehow manage to get on your tail and keep up with you. How most players now seem to be flying russian planes for some reason (like it wasn't an issue before!). Maybe someone can put together a list of good things that came out of this patch because I can't?



Following Comment by Aerial_Fury:

&gt;""This. This post is well constructed with both LOGIC and REASON as well as an appeal to emotion. This post deserves more attention.
 
&gt;I agree with everything in that post but if I could add my own two cents:
 
&gt;A few people are saying the new damage model makes the game more ""rewarding"" and ""dynamic"". While these are both relative terms
 
&gt;The new damage model has given planes in arcade mode the ability to quickly (and I mean quickly) kill enemy planes. Planes have more vulnerable spots and even being nicked in the tail wing can make it impossible to fly let alone continue to fight and evade.
 
&gt;Now normally, aim reticule, lead reticule, etc.
Why is this a problem? Because it makes shooting down people TOO EASY. There is no skill
High damage WORKS in realism modes because targeting is so hard. It takes skill and maneuvering ability to hit your shots. This is not the case in arcade (which is not a bad thing
 
&gt;1.29 has REMOVED dogfighting from arcade in the forms of turn fighting and energy fighting. Fights are over faster than people can react simply because they took 1 machine gun bullet to the tail pipe. The game is no longer about targeting an enemies engines or wings as it was in 1.27. Before, you simply spray and hit whatever you can to completely immobilize them and you have won.
 
&gt;Sure 1.27 had problems with balance and such. BUT AT LEAST THE FIGHTS WERE DYNAMIC AND ENGAGING. Planes twisting and turning in epic 45 second fights to see who could get the advantage. Nicking each other with bullets but never getting a killing blow because they couldn't get an upper hand. With patch 1.29 it has simply become ""hey you got the first nick on the enemy plain
 
&gt;Among other things
 
&gt;OVERALL
 
&gt;As for the economy changes, this change can EASILY be felt within the first five minutes of playing arcade mode and is why I feel comfortable making such a post as this.""

TL;DR: Patch 1.29 needs a bit of work.

On the surface it has bells and whistles that might appeal to many



    Say you are a eager player
and you have sunk some cash and time into the game:

You have 150 planes in your hangar

This is no problem

The cost per plane is hard to estimate
in the region of 150 - 200.000 per plane seems reasonable.

Edit: At least if you look in the tier 9-20 range.



~~150 x 200.000 equals 30 million silver lions - to have the same performance in 1.33 as you have in the current patch for all of the planes you have already bought and ground.~~

Edit: Ok - the math was slightly for effect - Lets say 55 Planes you play times an average of 200.000
A ""mere"" 11 millions. Lets get back to this - Any which way  - Its going to be damn expensive.




    Now enter the lock out time for players leaving a game.
(Jury is still out on this one

You can frequently be matched with Jet planes playing a prop plane


They keep adding planes the matchmaker cannot handle

The matchmaker is sometimes so bad

~~Enter the grand development scheme to combat this: 
Lock out the player  of the game for the duration of the game or 5 minutes if he leaves.~~


    This fall nicely in line with other ways to punish players for playing the game:

...the repair times for planes you will not pay to repair is touching a week.

...the cost of repair so high for high tier planes



    Add to the mix
    The cost of high tier ammo will also become an issue in 1.33 I suspect.


Believe me
- And I have spent around 100 USD on the game to date.
I have more than 50 days of premium left on my account.

I will not spend another dime. I will not renew my premium in this environment.
    
    


    These developments are driving me away from a game I love
    which had the makings of being a WoWP killer










They are continuously developing game mechanics that are punishing the players for playing the game.

And in any F2P online multiplayer

There are huge logical flaws in game, meaningless objectives and useless game objects they could improve upon.

~~Instead the focus is on copying WoT
Not totally sold on the strikethrough but... ok..

The constant rebalancing of OP planes

~~There are premium planes that gets lower tiering than their stock counterparts.~~

This has the scent of ""Pay to Win"" and ~~I suspect premium ammo is not far away.~~

Its such a shame that this beautiful game

So

1. People need to keep playing the game. If people are not playing the game

2. Low repair costs make the game more fun. Even if you have to play a hundred matches to save up the money for your next plane they will be more fun than 15 matches where you are constantly worrying about how you will pay your repair bill.

3. Low repair costs promote team play. When your repair costs won't kill your profits from this battle and the last one you are more willing to stick your neck out to help a team-mate or complete an objective.

4. Long times between levels are far more bearable than not being able to play at all.

**(This is kind of TL;DRish for the first section)**

See what I mean? Better gameplay

---

**How The Economy Should Work**

We have a couple things to consider when considering how we want the economy to work.

1. We want to keep people in the game.

2. We want to make gameplay fun.

3. We want to make it accessible to all skill levels.

4. We want people to spend money.

So

But, right? No, under this system planes are balanced by their reward bonus. Doesn't punish rounds where you get insta-gibbed by AAA or whatnot, but still makes some planes less desirable.

Third, if you are making money every round you can at least know you won't be going backwards. This is where the advancement money comes in. Even if it takes a long time to level up you can be on playing. This will help with point 1 and 4.

Add cosmetic options to purchase. Historical and fun skins

Add ""Premium-a-Plane"" as a GE option. Ups the reward bonus and gives an experience bonus on any plane you buy it for. (This is just a good idea

This economy would receive some flak at first for being ""1.29 all over again""

**TL;DR** The new economy will be shit for player retention

**ANY MORE SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. IF I FUCKED UP SOME PART OF MY LOGIC PLEASE TELL ME. I WILL BE POSTING THIS ON THE FORUMS TOO.**

**GOT YOUR OWN IDEA ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY SHOULD WORK? POST IT IN THE COMMENTS!**

___

Why? Twofold explanation:

1. **You screw over your teammates by not climbing at the start.** Every fighter gone lawnmowing is a fighter missing on your side during the decisive high-altitude combat that takes place first in every round. If there are more enemies at high altitude than there are friendlies, the better the odds of winning 'the hill'.

2. **You will not make more by getting ground kills instead of air kills.** Statistically speaking

___

Common excuses that are not valid:

- *It's always worked for me so far!* Except when it hasn't

- *They'll ignore me anyway while you guys do the high-alt dogfights!* Oh yeah that's admirable

- *I'll just kill a few ground targets and then when they come for me I'll kill one or two by outturning them*. Energy advantage is the number one best asset for a fighter. A good energy fighter will wipe the floor with a good turnfighter because the skill cap is much higher and the tactics make much more sense: the energy fighter can strike at you from any angle and escape in any direction.

&gt; [...]So basicly i will bring some more light into the debate, and if those are valid i also integreate some new aspects of the FMs. Basicly due the core code changes, some 109 specs were moved, so i had to correct those again, the SL speed of the 109F4 was too high, its corrected, and the G2 was way to sluggish on high G manouvers etc.
Just to give alsao an impression how difficult it is to judge the right numbers, additional the Weatherconditions etc. So you get a lot of different numbers, so basicly i didn't went to extremes! We don't model the lowest neitehr the highest numbers, we modell the ones in which are backed up by a number of valid historical docs! And if we find an bug or something else, we gonna correct it!
 
&gt;What we're NOT doing, but that happen due some additional parameters of the core code engine. In such case we go back to those modells an correct the specs again. So no nerf and buff on FMs! It never happend here in the past, and it never will happen in the future! So please do me a farvour and stop using this WoW Language! My eras starts to bleed allready about it......

**Don’t Climb into a Fight!**

If you find yourself climbing into a fight you are almost always in the process of making a mistake. The enemy is almost sure to have the advantage in energy-state

**Attack from a position of advantage!**

Air Combat is War! Arena Combat is not the place for genteel dueling or gentlemanly “level playing field” flying. There are plenty of “Dueling Ladders” available for those so inclined. The Arena is not the place for that kind of flying philosophy. Its about using all the advantages that God gave you to shoot down other planes without being shot down yourself. Plan your attacks carefully. Move into a favorable attack position first – don’t just “jump into” that fur ball! Take advantage of “blind spots” and distraction opposition to score quick kills. Never give the opposition “an even break”


**Attack with surprise on your side!**

There is no law against cunning. Look for setting up a surprise attack on a target whenever possible. Look for situations where the target may have poor SA; move into blind spots and sneak up on the target!


**With a superior energy state go high
With an inferior energy state go low**

If you have the better energy state you have the advantage. Stay above your opponent if at all possible. After completing a gun pass its usually a big mistake to “go low” to reengage. Going high conserves energy. Going “low” is good when on the defensive. You are in trouble

**When it Doubt – Go Vertical!**

In air combat, its rarely a mistake to do so. Don’t stick to “flat” turns in a dogfight! That will lead to very high insurance premiums.

**Eternal Vigilance or Eternal Rest!**

The Most important factor in Air Combat is to see the opponent! Spot him first (and his friends!), keyboard etc) learn it backwards and forwards before you do anything else! Scan your views at least once every 15 seconds even in a “quiet” sky. Otherwise the first indication of danger could be bullets ripping through your plane.

Learn how to count!
Don’t attack outnumbered unless you have the energy advantage. The worse you are outnumbered the bigger the advantage should be. If you are badly outnumbered you only have to miscalculate the energy state of one of the enemy gaggle to end up going home via parachute.

**Calculate firing lead before opening fire!**

Don’t fire first and ask questions later! Try to gauge the “Kentucky Windage” before you pull the trigger. Otherwise you might find yourself flying around without ammunition real fast.

**Short Range! Short Bursts!**

When shooting, because ammo doesn’t grow on trees! Short bursts initially, then if you really have the range down, fire for effect! Generally shots over 300 yards are waste of time against a hard maneuvering plane. Get in close and hit hard! If the target is flying straight and level, shots to twice your convergence range are allowed. Outside of that you are most likely wasting ammo unless you are flying a plane like the P38 which has no gun convergence. Remember that Cannon will “drop” faster than machine guns at very long range.

**Get “Out of Plane” when being fired on!**

No that doesn’t mean bail out! When evading fire think aileron and rudder – not just elevator! The infamous “flat break turn” is the easiest defensive move to track with guns. That is an “in plane” maneuver

**Avoid “Dead Six”!**

Its generally wiser to attack slightly from the side than to attack from a dead-on Six O’clock position. The targets presents a very small cross section from “Dead Six”

**Think Energy – Not Stick**

There is an old saying “Colonels think tactics – Generals think Logistics”. Well Fighter Pilots a similar adage. “Average Pilots think Stick – Good Pilots think Energy!” Even when in a tight fur ball always keep relative energy states in mind. This will allow you to evaluate what he can do

**Turn into the attacker – not away!**

Well this one goes back to Boelke! By turning “into” the attack you are maneuvering so as to avoid allowing the guy to get on your “six”. By turning “away” from the attack you are making it easy for the attacker to gain angle.

**Lead turns – Its not just for the vertical anymore!**

Many pilots know that in the eternal battle for “angle”

**Remember the “Rule of 45″!**

When making a energy based rear quarter attack with a fair amount of closure on target, since your high speed will actually work against you as the target breaks low. Instead establish a lag pursuit situation or go vertical to establish a dominant altitude advantage with vertical separation. Then close in for another pass. Remember it is often takes several energy passes to “wear down” the targets energy state to the point where the kill is assured!

**Lag Pursuit with superior Energy.
Lead Pursuit with equal or inferior Energy.**

When attempting to gain gun angle on a target use geometry to close on target who has equal or higher energy by “cutting the corner” of his turn. That is, often you deliberately turn outside his circle, going high. This conserves energy advantage and sets up a more promising shot when you re-engage.

**Always Fly Aggressively!**

The biggest problem I had with the game before the patch was that my bullets did nothing far too often. It was like we were playing with nerf guns. When I burst fire into someones controls, I expect them to bleed. I am surprised to see so much backlash to rewarding people's situational awareness and maneuvering over slow reactions and mindless bullet hosing.

Note: I am only commenting on the damage here. I hope they do reconsider there choices with the grind.

Dorniers are good against bombers and sometimes you want to bomb yourself. Common things we all can agree.

Yet, at least almost. Not all of them can land on the carriers, you see.

1363860474.0,1aq3ng,The Reason it is Easier to Die yet Harder to Kill in 1.29.,keep_digging_watson,75,12,81,"So after playing the game for roughly thirty hours since the patch (ya I play a lot) I have finally come to the conclusion as to why it seems it is much easier to die yet harder to get kills in 1.29.

*To start off let me explain what the new damage model did to the game. The new DM placed more ""critical points"" on a plane's model. This means you can wound an enemy in a lot more places than in 1.27. In 1.27, included the tail, wings, engine, and propeller. Concentrated fire to any of these parts would result in an almost INSTANTANEOUS KILL meaning big white letters appear across the screen that say KILL CONFIRMED or whatever they say. This was satisfactory and felt rewarding knowing you had targeted the right spot and were able to concentrate your fire to that area. Most kills ended with an engine exploding, tail coming off, or a wing flying off.

*Now,immediate kill. What it has been replaced with is far more sensitive damage zones on the plane's model that all have far less impact as a whole. Now you can damage flaps, elevators, engines, fuselages, propellers, crewman, etc. All of which are very easy to hit and damage but none guarantee you an instant kill (except perhaps a direct hit to the pilot). 
What does this mean? Getting a kill is a much longer and more painstakingly drawn out experience for both the attacker and the victim. You might damage an enemies elevator on your first few well placed shots (guaranteeing an EVENTUAL death of that plane) BUT IF YOU WANT CREDIT FOR THAT KILL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY ON THAT PLANE AND KEEP FIRING AND FIRING AND WOUNDING AND WOUNDING UNTIL THAT PLANE CRASHES INTO THE GROUND, good luck trying to throw someone off your tail after you ""got a hole in your left wing"" from the first shot fired by the enemy.

**In summary**: 1.29 has decreased the chance of immediate death but GREATLY increased the chance of getting ""wounded"" in different parts of the plane which greatly decreases performance and leads to a LONG AND DRAWN OUT DEATH. Getting credit for kills has been made much harder due to the increased sort of ""window"" in which a plane is dying


**Edit**: A number of people have commented on how to improve on this system without changing the gameplay. Here are some of the points made that I think will really improve the system as is.

*1. Make an ""Assists"" column next to the ""kills"" column. While this is simply aesthetic

*2. Boost the amount of points given to people who get assists or to people who get critical shots on an enemy plane.

*3. Allow more than one person to get an assist on kill. For instance

I think these changes would greatly improve this game for the better,False,self,t5_2uc6j,1363886872.0,,,t3_1aq3ng

1369484887.0,1f0ysu,Unofficial transcript of Dev Q&amp;A from this Friday - 25/05/13,darkflare42,60,4,44,"Hey guys, Scarper BVV_d (Gaijin's ammo specialist) and Alex Polyakov (War Thunder Senior Programmer) who joined later on in the session.

During the Q&amp;A I transcribed the questions and answers, since they don't work on weekends.

Important to note that this is an **Unofficial** transcript - I left out certain questions which did not add to the discussion (Like questions on future development)

Here it is:

* **Q: Why can I set certain parts of a plane multiple times on fire
 * **A:** This is the current situation

* **Q: Why is mouse aim and instructor more resistant to damage than other control**
 * **A:** This is not true

* **Q: Is there a reason why certain planes with 12.7mm planes have more punch than other planes with .50 cals (they kill them faster)** 
 * **A:**  I think this is because of the different tolerance levels of damage for each plane you are attacking

* **Q: There is a glitch in spotting in FRB
 * **A:** Hang on

* **Q: It seems that Hispano cannons are not performing as well as the Japanese cannons or Germans MG
 * **A:** First you have to wait for the upcoming update, they will have a better explosive effect and thus it will be more efficient than it currently is. For Germans the MG cannon will have better fragmentation or splash effect from the HEI Minengeschoß rounds. So basically hang on tight an wait for the upcoming global patch - there are more surprises in it.

* **Q: It looks like there is an historical inaccuracy in the Ki-61 models - The Ki-61 1c should have HO-5 20mm japanese cannon and not the German MG151. The 1a 388 model should have the german MG151**
 * **A:** It could be that this is fixed in the next global update because they did a lot of work on the planes and guns which are currently in the game. We will however check it again

* **Q: Is there any plans to change the look and feel of how the cannons and the projectiles are fired - like giving them a shotgun effect with more recoil?**
 * **A:** As we said earlier, gun drop and the way the bullets behave is historically accurate.

* **Q: Will we be able to mount different ammo belts to specific machine guns in a certain plane? For example
 * **A:** Yeah we know about this issue

* **Q: Is the Type-99 mk2 performing correctly in HB at the moment or is it over-performing\under-performing?**
 * **A:** Regarding the current version of the game - In 1.29 they are not correctly implemented in comparison to other cannons

* **Q: Some of the load-outs of UK and US are not on par
 * **A:**  The most popular types of bomb loads during WW2 will surely be implemented

* **Q: When you have a damaged wing
 * **A:** The problem you are talking about will cause a change in plane behaviour for sure - We will look into it ASAP and fix it if this really is a problem\bug

* **Q: With the addition of the extra DM that you can take since last patch
 * **A:**  This ""issue"" is connected to the graphical load of GFX cards. We do want and we wish to make it, this is very hard work and it takes a lot of parameters to implement it correctly. We have to make compromises because some GFX cannot handle that much graphical fidelity. You will however see an increase in graphical variety of the damage inflicted Soon™

* **Q: Will we see a bomb bigger than 4k lb?** 
 * **A:** Most definitely yes. Heavier bombs will be introduced at some point

* **Q: When using .50 cals it seems to take 600 rounds to take out plane
 * **A:** The .50 cals weren't super effective historically

* **Q: Do all the rounds in this game have the correct ballistic co-efficiency and is there a damage curve which reduces their effectiveness in regards to range?**
 * **A:** Yes it is  calculated but it will be more accurate in the upcoming update. The higher the caliber the more the loss of energy, weight etc. It will be changed in the upcoming update and it will be much more detailed. 

* **Q: How do you get the stats on the bullets and the damage that they inflict
 * **A:** The ballistics are calculated from real documentation

* **Q: Do you plan on adding more shell racks and variety?**
 * **A:** Most definitely yes. As an example you will have a new belt for the Stuka G1 &amp; G2 (37mm cannons) with only HEF shells which will be more effective for hunting bombers. There will be more ammo belts for other planes as well this was just an example.

* **Q: Hit detection
 * **A:** when you see the damage decal, it is something that we will have to work on, but improvements are coming. 

* **Q: Mouse aim users can pull off maneuvers which Joystick users cannot even try to attempt
 * **A:** We want to implement different filters for you to use when you queue up for a match like ""no mouse players"" for example, we do want more and more people playing on realistic settings rather than arcade and mouse-aim.

* **Q: Economics
 * **A:** We will have a special economy update deployed

Tony was at university in England when the war broke out and enlisted in the RAF. He became a fighter pilot flying mostly Spitfires with many squadrons including 453 (RAAF) Squadron in Europe.

Credited with 12 1/2 official victories and four probables Tony commented the real total was more than 20 due to the stringent claiming requirements.

He was himself shot down over occupied territory in 1943 and with facial and head wounds was fortunately rescued by the French Resistance and made his way back to active service in England.

Tony was the first Australian to fly a jet fighter (in 616 Squadron) and on only his second flight almost killed himself attempting to break the speed of sound in a vertical dive.

When flying a Spitfire XIV he shot down a Me262 jet fighter and later Arado AR234 jet bomber.

At the end of the war he managed to fly several examples of enemy aircraft including the Fw190

I was nestled in amongst the AI B17's on Bulge


I don't see any purpose to flying aircraft with ridiculous repair prices when I can be just as effective in other aircraft and be paid similarly.


If I want so desperately to fly a B17 I'll go play IL2. There's no way I'm buying lions simply because the economy/gaijin is trying to herd me into it.


I personally find this an extremely slimy and desperate attempt at making money when other games have shown you can be profitable by just selling cosmetic items.


I was at the Q&amp;A and this is the impression I have from listening to the devs trying to explain away the mammoth repair costs.


Thoughts ?




TL;DR Gaijin has gimped their own game in a grab for profit when other models don't fuck the players around and are profitable.

Alright, you so mad right now get on my level 360noscopeMLG"".  A guy lands and lets the enemy team get their farm on a bit before he quits a losing game.  Or an opponent who gave you the ride of your life by putting up the most amazing fight you ever saw before exploding into a ball of flames.  Not that cheesey mouse wiggling tree weaving my way back to AAA cover crap, mind you.  I am talking like boss tier ACM.  

These things happen, I wish more players were like that"".  Well I think there could be more players like that.  I feel that if players could recognize and reward eachother's random acts of awesomeness, they would become more frequent and the playerbase/community as a whole would improve.  And I like the sound of that.  So I figured out a way that we could reward each other for it.

I call it the ""Salute"" feature.  

Basically, and a mail message that says ""(player) has saluted you"".  Or you could even type a custom message to go along with it.  Saluting would give the other player a minor reward like 250-500 lions or something.  Small enough to avoid exploitation, and large enough to be significant.  You could also limit it so that you could only salute one player per game.  I guess you could still have clans that just automatically salute each other every game they enter, but seriously, 500 lions isn't going to break the game.

**TO BEGIN**!
Freedom is an export
    
   I'm not doing reserves because I never play them(you make like 100 lions per kill

* **THE SAILING KINGFISHER**   *OS2U-1* and *OS2U-3*


Title says it all. Pretty much useless, however, on water maps. Get a few friends together and go on a family boating trip. May  be upgraded to 2x 100lb bombs. Useful only in that it leads to better bombers later in the tree. 

*Cockpit*

Can't be bothered for cockpit view because fuck this plane.

* **THE MIGHTY BUFFALO**   *F2A-1* and *F2A-3*

This plane is amazing. It zooms about, this plane is so tiny that you either have to be close enough, or directly behind it to shoot it down with any kind of regularity. However, the few rounds that do hit you will quickly turn your plane into future soda cans. 

*Cockpit*

Decent sight all around

^1 there are currently no awesome voiceovers

* **THE UTILITARIAN CATALINA**   *PBY-5* and *PBY-5A*

The Ultimate Troll Plane, bug zapper, there's always something for the [Catalina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_PBY_Catalina) to do. It has a strange bombload. 16 100lb bombs, useful for annoying tanks or bombing suckers on the runway (seriously the best shit ever), 2 battleship destroying [Mark 13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_13_torpedo) torpedos, 4 500lb bombs, or 4 1000lb bombs. It has a total of 4 gunners on it, 2 12.7mm x2 gunners on the sides (which look either like testes, some rolling and wiggling about should bring them back into the [danger zone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KBZCDMIKOk).

*Cockpit*

None

* **THE SURPRISINGLY USEFUL DAUNTLESS**   *SBD-3*

The [Dauntless](http://www.boeing.com/boeing/history/mdc/dauntless.page) is an excellent, because it's tough enough to take a couple hits from gunners. The Dauntless' gunner, however, is a certified badass. His/her dual .50 cal on the rear has sent many pilots to their forefathers in Valhalla. It's bombs, 2x 100lb (which drop first) and 1x 1000lb, are perfect for swooping in like a disgruntled pigeon and shitting on tough single targets.

*Cockpit*

A clusterfuck of metal shit. Includes the zoom telescope thing that is in the Buffalo

Thanks to the Gaijin crew for saying up to 3:40 AM to answer our questions.  
  
**Q: Will hit stats be added to gamer card?**  
 A: Yes more stats will be added to gamer card and leaderboard etc so you can see how you are improving.  

---
  
**Q: Why was the new variations of P47 and P51 seen on test server not included in 1.31 ?**  
A: They need more adjusting and will be in a patch in the close future.  

---
  
**Q: Joystick improvments for AB ? Some planes are instable in AB like Bf 109 F4
A: We will look into this. It shouldn't be worse than it was in real life.  

---
  
**Q: Why were the later FM improvements to P-38 and 47 seen on dev server not included in 1.31 ?**  
A: They should have made it over to 1.31.  

---
  
**Q: N1K2 missing its automatic combat flaps (g-force activated) will this be implemented ?**  
A: Post it in the suggestion forum along with your sources.  

---
  
**Q: Will we be able to see some sort of Escort fighter spawn ? (Ie. Spawning at Bomber altitude). As fighters are split between Interceptors and Escort
A: We will have to talk about game balance etc. Not a bad suggestion and we will think about it.  

---
  
**Q: Why the 128 man limit on squadrons/clan ?**  
A: Technical reason and the guy responsible is not here. Current size will stay for now. [Personal note: My stab in the dark: the database is limited to a 1 byte value for squadron member id.]

---
  
**Q: Both La5 and F4U Corsairs have engines that dies with 1 hit. And oil temperatures of F4U does not go down even if landed or repaired**  
A: Bugged Damage Model it is fixed now. Engine does not die from 1 hit. To kill a radial engine that size it takes 2 or 3 hits from 20mm shells

---
  
**Q: Will xp unlocks be uniform ? (Different planes have different xp required to unlock simimar weapon loads).**  
A: We will change it in future updates.  

---
  
**Q: Does the current FM on P-51D run off Merlin engine or Alison engine? It seems underpreforming at high altitude.**  
A: Merlin  

---
  
**Q: What happened to planes like F9F Panther it seems like it was in the game.**  
A: They were on dev servers but are not ready and need more adjustments.  

---
  
**Q: HB Could fighters with bad climb rate get air start as to not be swarmed by Doras or F4Us ?**  
A: Like said before we will think about an escort start altitude but for now don't climb straight into the combat area

---
  
**Q: Will we get ability to change crosshair colors? sometimes its hard to see when switching to gunner view.**  
A: Old idea

---

**Q: (FRB) Any plans for seperate profiles/configurations for each planes?. One configuration may be good for aircraft A but not so good for aircraft B** 
A: It is on the job list but its low priority.  

---
  
**Q: Back in Wings of Prey (previous flight game Gaijin worked on) we had many user made skins.**  
A: [*This got to be the strangest answer given in QAs so far*] Borisych: Yes yes we don't doubt your abilites to make beatiful skins but we have limitations from terms of security. Adding or changing new skins is connected to actual gaming data and we are trying to protect you from reverse engineeering of our software. Thats why as far as skins are part of the game in this way. Unfortuntatily we are still looking for a way to make it seperate from game data to allow you to create your own. Untill now unfortunately for us we just cannot allow you do to this because it might harm your computer and in the end your personal data is more valueable. For now we have no instruments/tools to make allow you to do this unfortunately. We have different systems of combining gaming data in one pack then other games thats why there is some restrictions including skins.

**Q: Obscure IL-10 with turboprop engine was there any data on it ?**  
A: .. Investigating. Ingame we have standard engine for IL-10 the AN42 an improved version of the IL-2 engine with approx 2000 hp.

**Q: Why after 1.31 when you got rammed by a teammate and your plane gets destroyed and the friendly plane suffers a crittical damage and crashes after 5 secons I get the TK credit penality while the person who destroyed my plane does not.**  
A: Its not easy to automatically understand who did what.

**Q: Theres been some discussion lately about F6F-3 Hellcat climbate
A: Will check.

---

  
  
**Q: The recent diary and random trophies. Are they 'random' or actual skill ?**   
A: They will be based on how you preform in the match.  

---

  
**Q: Will squad be adjustable/increased in the future? For instance if a group of 12 people wanted to fly together the current limit of 4 prohibits this.**  
A: There will be additional type of squad which will allow people from sqaudron to play together with bigger numbers than 4 players.  

---

  
  
**Q: In the upcoming economy patch is the repair prices going to be higher then they currently are?**  
A: Yes

---

  
**Q: (follow up question) Do you think this will affect the player base negatively ?**  
A: The economy update will be bittersweet

---

  
**Q: With the current way the FM teams are working (International and Russian) there is a lot of talk about bias in game. Could this be avoided by having the two teams work closer together
A: Target for both team is to have FMs preform as they were in real life. We will add more forum posts in the future so any one from our playerbase can see what parameters we adjust and how far this is from what you get ingame.  

---

  
**Q: When internal parts get damaged will you change it so that you no longer can pull high g-forces manouvers without breaking up ?**  
A: Yes this is planned. If you for example have a damaged wing spar you will have less durability and can not substain high g-forces in turns.

 **Q: Ki-43 is missing self sealing fuel tank and rear pilot protection http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/16587-43-ii-hayabusa/?p=455859 **

A: [annoyed voice] yes yes.  

---

  
**Q: Hello guys I loved the recent changes to decals and hangars in general in patch 1.31. However it is still a pain to arrage a pair of jaws and teeth aligned on the nose the right way. Will you guys make it easier to apply the jaws and eyes without straining to align them with each others
A: Yes

---

  
**Q: Will squadron leaderbord show winrate instead just number of target destroyed? Any one can go into arcade and rack up massive kill numbers.**  
A: We are working on adding more leaderbords and winrates later on.  

---

  
**Q: Sometimes I experience some sort of bugged hit detection. For example
A: High ping or packetloss issue. Game (client) renders shell impact  while server judges hits. This explains why you see shells hitting but enemy flying like no damage was done. If it happens without high ping/packetloss issue then  send us replay with logs so we can examine it.  

---

  
**Q: Some times I forget to load TrackIR drivers and notice it lacking after spawning in battle
A: We will look into it as its a custom device smiliar to Oculus Rift and we would like to have  support for this.

---

  
**Q: Suggestion
A: We will discuss it internally.

Now this little fellow here said something rather interesting as the onset of the Econ patch started up and said something along the lines of ""I dont seem to be repairing the actual repair cost even when im killed"" this perked my interest because I recall in the patch notes something was slipped in

*""4. After-battle calculation of damage dealt to a plane is changed

This change is not small at all, he was right, incredbily right. I took out my D13 to test his theory which has a repair rate of about 15k lions, and upon death in my first battle with it where I bailed out of the aircraft before it crashed, my repair cost was **barely 6k!** So I was scratching my head and not before long I realized that it said ""MAX repair rate"" not ""AVERAGE repair rate"". In the end you only pay 15k for the D13 IN THE WORST POSSIBLE CASE SCENARIO.

With this in mind I decided to collect some data

B1 : Rep cost : 9702

	 Death type : Pilot Death (Black left wing ; Hull)
	 
B2 : Rep cost : 6197

	 Death type : Plane ram (Black left wing)

B3 : Rep cost : 13884

	 Death type : Fire death

B4 : Rep cost : 13769

	 Death type : Crash (Only Engine remaining)

B5 : Rep cost : 6198

	 Death type : Fire but Bailed out (Black right wing)	 

Bailing out of the aircraft, etc etc. Crashing or dying by fire seems to produce the most repair costs. But in most cases I never got close to the actual 17k repair cost, in fact, if I bail out before actually dying my repair cost is **MORE then 50% less then what it should be!** In fact its barely a third of the old repair cost!

Now I dont have the time to test every plane to see the repair costs and how it changes with each

Now this still doesnt answer the problem of some of the retardedly increased rep costs of some planes such as the Meteor F4's 110k rep cost and the Spit IX 23k rep cost along with the G10 outrageos 46k cost,False,self,t5_2uc6j,False,all-discussion,japan,t3_1h4tag

Look at the chat...
this guy was giving my position away the whole game because I was flying my b-17 the way it was built to fly.. at high altitudes and the other team was talking shit saying I suck and im a noob. this is how I boycott expensive repair bills and UFO's so sorry if I don't like paying for repair bills

*EDIT* By the way im tired of people saying im dissing the other team firstly the guy on my team that was giving my position away after multiple times of me telling him to stop he insisted to continue and that's when I said I was reporting him than I wrote because of his douchbaggary. so there you have it. also their were Russians on the other team probably using Google translate to call me a noob in loosely translated English to descend saying ""defend the pride of American peoples and come down"" so their you have it I don't want anymore hate comments or people down vote stalking me because they think I started this whole thing I was polite the whole time. the dude deserved to be called a douche who in their rite minds gives away the position of their team? Also! for the people calling me childish for this post you should re evaluate your situation for downvoting ever single post I have made providing the facts to curious players wanting the whole story... people like you ruin communities and make me want to leave reddit. people like you are the immature ""childish people"" We redditors and WT players always get a bad rap for your childish behaviours. also if you think this post is childish look at yourselves calling me a fag/noob/asshole/dick/cunt for using my bomber as intended. and infact I wasent wasting anyone's time I was simply climbing high enough for me to pick them off one by one so they were almost inmanuverable  

TL:DR dropped my bombs on their base in HB and climbed HIGH and teammate gave my postion away

&gt;Sorry for the inconvenience.

I wanted to make this before hordes of players start complaining


Moving on, and they change the prices and repair costs of aircraft that are flown more, or consistently have good results, the Dev server did not offer enough solid information (I think). Considering how maybe less than 1000 people where actively playing at one time, and when they were it was mostly jet users, the information Gaijin was trying to use was probably skewed.

Anyhow, simple ideas and reasons for the economic delay. Also because I really don't want 3,000 people asking//complain//taking screenshots about the economy not changing.

So I loaded a crew up with 17500xp points and went to work.

I won't bore you too much with the detailed numbers suffice to say here are the top 3 most XP hungry skills to max out;

Experienced Gunners (6120xp for 10 gunners - not that you'd need that many) 
Pilot G-Force Tolerance (5620xp) 
Reload Speed (5441xp)

So it all added up to a fully trained Bomber Crew (with only 5 gunners) at 31122xp points - that's 1911 golden eagles if you want to buy. 

A fully trained fighter crew (no gunner skills) is 22540xp points - 1340 golden eagles.

In monetary terms assuming a 5000 golden eagle purchase (British Pounds - convert as you see fit/taxes may vary) of £8.32 for a bomber crew and £5.84 for a fighter crew.

A fully skilled 7 plane hanger (5 fighters

**Q: Will the Italian tech tree be competitive against tier 20 jets?**  
A: (Borisych) There will be italian jet fighters later on. Soon(TM).

---
  
**Q: Camouflages like on P-40 that requires Malta and Mustang Mk.1A that requires Kuban

A: (Borisych) There were some changes recently that were not updated


---
  
**Q: Recently someone asked about why the Arado-234 is matched against planes it wasn't designed to outrun and according to a transcript that's now missing from the forums (unpinned unofficial transcription of a russian QA).**  

A: (**Borisych**) We had a huge discussion with our russian players about Arado 234. According to our internal statistics from servers Arado is very effective. For instance if we had not limited the game to 20 tiers Arado would be approximately tier 25 [O.o WTF?!].  
(**FM guy**) 24!.  
(**Borisych**) Based on its efficiency in the game. If we down tiered to 14-15 none of the propeller aircrafts would reach it because its a jet. Yes its slower than Migs and Sabres but its faster then regular fighters and this is the point. With its climb and speed its virtually untouchable by any fighter except jets.


---
  
**Q: Have you thought of a different way of ranking? Some planes seems to be ranked too low or too high
  
A: Yes we are going have to do some changes in our ranking in the future so it will be better.

---
  
**Q: Do you have any plans to increase FRB and HB player base rather then just arcade? Especially in FRB battle ques are fairly long.**  

A: (Alex) When we released open beta test we had 90% arcade players now we have more players moving towards HB so the game is changing. So we have some plans to change FRB which I can't tell about now that should increase FRB players and make it more suited for FRB players.

---
  
**Q: My question is about the US flight models 1.31 we didn't get. Can we look for those in next major update? You mentioned a separate QA for the next major update.**  
  
A: (Borisych) Better suited for the next QA

---
  
**Q :Ammo types and general damage using a Corsair I have put hundreds of rounds into a wellington tail gunner turret but he (gunner) didn't die. I only kill gunners by accident not when I aim for them.**

A: (Borisych) We look into it.


---
  
**Q: Do you have any plans to add birds to the game ?**  

A: (Alex) We have thought about it but never gotten around to implement it maybe later. Its not only a question about art


---
  
**Q: When can we expect to see ships ?**  

A: Soon(TM)


---
  
**Q: [Muted user so I missed his question] ?? New planes ?? Release trees ??**  

A: (**Borisych**) We will update it after the next major update as theres some vitial changes in it right after it we will update the release tree.  
 (**FM Guy**) We will add the Soon(TM) when the official transcription is written.

---
  
**Q: If you hold WEP in P47 you get a reduction in speed is this a bug you know about ?**  

A: (FM guy) We know about this bug we have set up a new Quality Assurance team which we should have done in the beginning really. Their job is to test fly all the flight models on the dev server using all their different controls etc and make sure the aircraft reaches speed


---
  
**Q: Are there some plans made to high altitude interception like P-47 and Ta-152. Are we going to see high altitude missions where they can be used to good effect?**  

A: (**Borisych**) We have added new high alt interceptors including MiG-3 so they should have their historical role in the game somehow.  
(**Alex**) High alt interceptors are for intercepting high alt bombers obviously and to make bomber fly at high altitude more we will probably spawn high altitude bombers on bigger altitudes further from the battlefield


---
  
**Q: A new IL-2 game is coming out

A: (**Borisych**) Be better.  
(**Alex**) We are improving our FRB mode and we will improve it further


---
  
**Q: Why does FRB map rotation work the way it currently does?**  

A: (**Alex**) Due to low FRB population so the queuing is done faster
(**FM guy**) Every map need to be fully tested in all modes and with low population it just takes longer.

---
  
**Q: On the forums there have been quite a stirrup about german mk108

A: (**Slava**) We have not changed anything intentionally this should work as intended.  
(**Borisych**) Submit a bug report with replay and .clog files will make it easier for us to track down possible bugs.

---
  
**Q: US .50 cals seems to be underperforming.**  

A: (**Borisych**) Next update will bring new mechanic to US.50 cal machineguns.  
(**Slava**) Not limited to just US all MGs will be changed. All MGs in general will deal more damage. Americans will have new historical .50 cal ammobelts


---
  
**Q: Matchmaker is it working as planned? ATM you have planes from tiers 8-9 joining a tier 4-5 game.**  

A: (**Borisych**) [Lot of gibberish that made little sense.] It takes highest tier plane selected AND nation rank into account.  
(**MM Guy**) [I failed to scribble down his answer but it sounded more reasonable then what Borisych tried to say] Basically lower high tier population gives high tier bit more delta to make matches and it will improve when we get more players.

---
  
**Q: My question has already been answered but could you give more details about coming FRB changes ?**  

A: (Alex) One part is improving the quality of flight models and we know about the visibility issue, how you fly FRB. I can't say more about it now, work in progress.

---
  
**Q: I noticed MiG 15 got the flight model for another MiG-15 it is more like the MiG-15bis.**  

A: (Alex) It should be the MiG-15bis just that it looks like the first MiG-15. If you're asking about Sabres then yes we should have new cool Sabers.


---
  
**Q: Regarding the new testers is there any chance you will accept public volunteers or is it limited to Gaijin staff?**  

A: (FM guy) We have put out advertisment for testers and we have gotten a big response and I just started shortlisting the people today.


---
  
**Q: Back to the matchmaker. Shouldn't the matchmaker disallow more than 4 players of the same clan in the same map? It seems that Match Maker stacks tier 20 jets on one side quite frequently.**  

A: (Alex) MM guy isn't here so wait for the official transcription the answer will be there.

---
  
**Q: Mentioned in previous answer

A: (Borisych) Soon(TM)

---
  
**Q: Could we expect major update in the next few month? Which will add new planes.**  

A: (FM guy) We can't talk about future development. Next question !!!

---
  
**Q: I've been playing lot of HB last days but I've noticed a lack of bombers in games especially germans in mid to high rank games. Last patch you would see Heinkels or Dorniers and now you see maybe 1 bomber on german side and it dies in seconds.**  

A: [Wait for the official transcription answer. Too much gibberish sprouted by devs while ignoring constructive feedback from other players].

---
  
**Q: FW-190 cockpit is graphically wrong.**  

A: (Borisych) Its on the todo list.

---
  
**Q: On the FRB forums there has been discussions about having historical plane sets which would push newer users into FRB where it would be easier to play FRB with less than level 5 planes is that something you are interested in doing ?**  

A: (Alex) Yes.

---
  
**Q: Do you plan on role based bonus? Ie. bomber get more more for ground kills then a fighter would.**  

A: (**Borisych**) Yes.  
(**Alex**) When you destroy a ground target with a bomber you get more rewards and less rewards with the fighter.


---
  
**Q: Logbook is not correct do you plan to improve it?.**

**Q: Any plans against vultures now the airfield AAs are weak ?**  

A: (**Alex**) Its a general problem for all of us. I'm not sure its weak at least in HB &amp; FRB. I've been shot down by it very often. Players can interact with each other and we want to encourage this so they will be able to cooperate and have some guard the airfield while other reload.  
(**FM guy**) This is the idea with squadrons to have someone to watch your back and protect each other.


---
  
**Q: Which is the criteria for planes to be added ?**  

A: (Borisych) Two main criteria 1. Fill gaps we currently have in tech trees. 2. Readiness of models. In next update we will have planes to close gaps in two nations.

We have tried many of them and have worked out some kinks on how to make them better. Here is a quick list of what games we've made. We want to share these great ideas will all the players of War Thunder.



**1)**  **David and Goliath aka Biplanes and Bombers:** * This game type has been perhaps our most successful and fun. The name pretty much says it all. On one team there is a series of reserve biplanes, the bombers try to survive. This game type is best done on smaller maps.



**2)**  **Sharks vs Minnows:** * This game is derived from a game in reality usually played in deep swimming pools. There are two teams. One Shark (A Jet or other powerful plane) and a series of Minnows (Biplanes



**3)**  **Battle Ships:** * This game is rather unique to War Thunder



**4)**  **Dodge Plane:** * We're still working out the kinks for this game but here's the concept anyways. Dodge Plane is similar to Dodge Ball, and run like hell. From what you ask? The entirety of the enemy team whose sole objective is to ram you going full speed. The Rammers must use the fastest plane they have available, they must maintain their full speed at all times, and they may **NOT** let up on their throttle or use flaps at any time. 



So far that's all we've been able to hammer out, well... They pray and run like hell. Last one alive wins. Best done on maps with proper airfields.

&gt;Transcript - Director's Cut:

&gt;Will there be selectable ammo choices for gunners?

It is quite logical. We probably have it at future.

 

&gt;Will there be new Jets at next update?

Yes.

 

&gt;Are you considering to reduce the crew's training cost of premium planes?

Premium planes are not better. It is a unique experience. They should be in balance like ohters.

 

&gt;Will we see an addition to the planes

There is a possibility. We always respect historical accuracy.

 

&gt;Will there be more information in Encyclopedia about damages

We will have War Thunder wiki very soon. You should find whole information about everything on there.

 

&gt;Are there any plans to add cockpits to bombers?

Yes.

 

&gt;Situation of Economy?

We are always working on economy. We had radical changes and it is not perfect. We know it. This could scare some players but fear not. We are trying to balance it constantly.

 

&gt;Sub Forums:

 

&gt;French

&gt;Can We have some news about French Planes?

There is no definite answer to this question.

 

&gt;What are the key deadlines of the project?

We cannot say it now. But it will be on time.

 

&gt;What will be the next big update?

We will see it at the end of the month probably.

 

&gt;Magyar

&gt;Are there any plans for greater bombs (500-2000kg) creating craters?

Before implementing ground forces

 

&gt;Are there any plans to create battles with different amount of players? Like between 10-25 players/side depending on the size of the map.

Due to current amount of players

 

&gt;Are there any plans to create/enable us to define different control pre-sets for different aircrafts/aircraft types? Like a control settings for bomber

Interesting question. We will think about it.

 

&gt;Czeck

&gt;What about PBY-5 Catalina and D &amp; G versions of Ju-87? Both of them lacks part of their defensive armament - PBY-5 Catalina had 2x7

 

About Catalina

 

&gt;Do you plan to add shooting range or more targets into test flight? I would like to be able to test different impacts before i buy the plane.

There will be additional targets in test flight for sure. Thanks.

 

&gt;Will we be able to open cockpit canopy in future? This feature should be quite usable in FRB.

There is an option to do that but when it will be implement into the game? I do not know.

 

&gt;Chinese

&gt;Have you got a plan about ""Reconnection"" feature? When?

We are working on it.

 

&gt;When will ”guns-targeting-distance“feature be available in Arcade Battle?

Very soon.

 

&gt;Does the Bomb work as intended now?

Yeah they're. We have more accurate bombs according to the their historical ones.

 

&gt;Polish

&gt;Will there be more repaints for airplanes

There will be new options to customize your planes. You can pick some specific nation or squadron skins soon.

 

&gt;Will there be a ""European"" aircrafts nations tree including other European nations in the future (or more as premium aircraft) from Poland for example?

Poland,Finland, Norway made decent contribution to WWII. We are considering to give more space to them. By means of models and skins.

 

&gt;What level of realism we will have in World War mode? Is it possible to have three kinds of level of realism like now (Arcade

Yes. At World War mode

 

&gt;Turkish

&gt;Could you give us a sneak peak about World War mode?

No.

 

&gt;Is it possible to play Arcade Battles in a larger map? Like HB's? There is no time to climb at arcade battles specially with bombers.

Probably no. It may badly effect to whole game play of arcade.

 

&gt;Yak-3 literally better than Bf 109 G-10 and it could be accessible way before it. Do you plan to rebalance it?

Yes. We probably raise Yak-3's tier.

 

&gt;Italian

&gt;Any plan to expand the early jet era planeset in the near future ?

Yes.

 

&gt;What about a multicrew option ?

No. We probably will not have this function in the game.

 

&gt;Is the World War mode something close to a MMO with a persistent world ?

We cannot answer this question.

 

&gt;Spanish

&gt;Is there going to be Squadron wars like Clan wars in Wot?

Cannot speak about future plans but probably

 

&gt;Is there going to be more capacity for players in premium player squads?

It is all about future plans

 

&gt;Will be possible to add the squadron tag to nicknames?

No definite answer on it.

 

&gt;Porteguese

&gt;When will full support for ATI Crossfire be available? Question asked by a user with a 4 monitor setup. 3 wide

Not now but it'll be a support absolutely.

 

&gt;Each HB takes too much time... FRB way more time and I need special hardware... What is the point of moving out of arcade if i can also get all the planes ?!

Point is increasing your own skills and progress. More realistic

 

&gt;Forgive the disbelief

It is a good answer. But we cannot give any information about future development. We can only answer current situations right now.

 

&gt;German

&gt;I would like to have more targets on the test flight/training mission. This would be a good opportunity to train strafing and bombing runs. Also it would be nice if these targets would reappear after being destroyed.

Yes

 

&gt;Can we get a definitive list of finished/unfinished FMs for planes? Knowing which plane has a placeholder FM would help to avoid player disappointment as well as endless discussions about OP/UP planes on the forums and in chat.

That's a good question. We will have to discuss that internally. I think there is good chance that such a list will be published. It will of course only include planes that are already in game.

 

&gt;Today I was flying in a BF110 and was chasing a A-20 (AFAIK Wingspan is 18.69m). When both wingtips touched the revi circle he should have been 180-190m away from me. However the icon readout showed a distance of 460m. Which one is correct? Is the revi set to 1/10 or 1/20 and if it is set to 1/20 will this be changed to the historical correct value?

I will have to check that with the developers

 

---------------------------------- Continue from chat questions--------------------------------

 

&gt;Can we play Tanks and Planes in a same map?

Probably yes. But we are not allowed to answer this kind of question.

 

&gt;Will you increase MG damage of bombers?

Balistics are accurate

 

&gt;If we have a timeframe for FRB in US servers?

We still have not enough players to test it. I cannot give an exact time.

 

&gt;Problem with getting up from ground with Typhoon?

It is probably a bug. We will dig it.

 

&gt;Engine management in HB and FRB seems half implemented?

Yes. In a time you will get more advance controls.

 

&gt;Team-killing?

We are tightly observing TKs and already implemented a modul to punish them to game with last update.

 

&gt;Are you gonna put more maps to Arcade Mod?

Absolutely. We will have Berlin map very soon.

 

&gt;Flight models for P-47 and P-38 FM is dont seem correct?

Yes. We just finished revision of P-47. We will working on it.

 

&gt;When you land in HB without damage you only get re-armed but you do not get an option about fuel. What can be done to that?

Possibly it is a bug. We will work on this.

 

&gt;How about joystick control?

Wait for good changes. Last update introduced advanced joystick controls but we are improving it constantly.

 

&gt;For instance

Unfortunately

 

&gt;I can engage tier4 players with my reserve plane. It could be fixed in future?

Sometimes this happen. Because system could merge players from higher levels to start a match. When we have more players at HB and FRB rankings work more effective.

 

&gt;Fjords will be available for FRB?

Possibly

 

&gt;Will we be able to buy gold with SMS?

Yes. It is still in progress. We had long negotiations with ohter payment operators

 

&gt;We cant turn of our engines on HB?

Turn of instructor and it will be good.

As some of these were addressed in 1.33 I thought it was time to analyse the changes and look at what could be done to further improve the game.

In summary

1. Ground Strike - I love the near-total removal of the infamous Gremlins/Barabashka, so the game is over very quickly indeed - Port in particular is worse than it was with Gremlins.  Secondly, the rules over which units to attack in order to win the battle, and which to leave alone, are far from clear to new players.  Perhaps their target icons could be coloured differently, and text displayed at the beginning saying (for example) ""kill all the orange targets to win the mission"".

2. Domination - The main reason for the parallel ticket bleed introduced in 1.31 was, who just have more planes, and not by those who are playing better, which is unfair"".  The ticket bleed forced a shorter game, which stopped players with many slots from spamming superior plane numbers in order to win, but which also resulted in tentative &amp; defensive gameplay that often ended with both teams still flying a full airforce, especially on maps with 2 airfields.  Now the bleed speed is slower

3. Bombing.  In my previous post I complained of the affect from reducing splash radii, as not only is it difficult to hit targets with them, they often cost more than what you receive as reward for sinking a ship.  I can understand if Gaijin don't want bombers to become easy money trees, but its gone too far in the other direction.  Less bombers in the sky means less heavy fighters trying to intercept them, resulting in shallower &amp; more meaningless gameplay where single engine fighters circle around going for kills, while shouting ""Attack the Ground Targets"" to their team-members.

4. Rewards encouraging teamwork.  The lack of teamwork in Arcade has been known &amp; commented on for a long time now, or for playing to the misison's objectives. The economy also rewards ""staying alive"", which is the antithesis of taking risks to win the battle for your team. The result, as anyone who plays AB can verify, are trains of fighters jostling each other as they chase an isolated enemy. It rewards selfish behaviour at the expense of your team. Suggestion: Make assists &amp; criticals worth almost as much as kills, and show assists on the stats board. In addition, please reward playing to the objectives: in Ground Strike provide high rewards for rescuing and conversely shooting/assisting bombers and ground targets, for capping enemy bases or making enemy bases neutral (these last two are usually suicide missions and should be rewarded appropriately).""  To Domination I'd add a proximity-based award for other nearby players when an enemy field is capped

To point 4 I'd also add making the bonus for winning the mission either the current XP/SL reward

Unfortunately nothing has been done at all, the majority of arcade players won't see any reason why they should put their planes on the line for their team, and selfish play will continue to be the norm.  Players are only doing what the current reward system tells them to do - get kills and stay alive - and that's working to the detriment of overall gameplay.

* First and foremost there will be the Soviet and the German research trees. Other nations will be in a way Italy present in German tree now. In future other nations will get their own research trees.

* First of all

* The basis of the ground forces will be mass-produced vehicles. Prototypes and paper models to be used in extreme cases.

* One of the options to resolve the issue of the lack of high-tiered tanks in some nations - implementing upgraded specimens of existing types of vehicles. Example: Tiger II with a 105 mm gun (original caliber gun - 88 mm). Gun existed

**Planned**

* Dependence of fire behavior from the ignition source (oil
* Possibility to blow up the external fuel tanks
* The possibility of shell explosion inside of the barrel of a tank
* The possibility of shooting off the barrel of a tank
* The possibility of detachment of the tank gun turret with a successful hit
* Interchangeability of the tank crew. Injured crew member could be replaced with other
* Virtual instructor (gunner) in arcade mode (counts level of elevation of guns)
* Night missions (with artillery star shells
* Smokescreens
* Destructible buildings (most of them)
* Sightseeing of Berlin :) 
* Simulation of the suspension: patency depends on the type of soil
* Modular damage system
* The spread of fire in/on the tank
* Ability to knock opponents off the cliff
* Accounting level of elevation of a barrel when firing
* Compliance with the potential range of the weapon with characteristics of real guns / ammunition (10 kilometers – is not the limit
* Possibility to shoot down the plane of the main gun of the tank (in the case of hit)
* On-screen armor as a modification of tanks
* Visual display of damage, etc.)	
* Shooting from the all of the tank weapons (guns
* Physics of ricochets
* Detailed terrain
* Virtual Assistants in arcade mode
* Camouflage system

**Under question**

* Player controlled artillery
* The model of collision and damage to main tank guns in contact with other objects
* Activation method of extinguishment (passive skill or button)
* Amphibious tanks

http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/22962-economy-v129-upd/page-47#entry273751

Quoted for those of you who do not have accounts

&gt;No hot leaks

&gt;1. The economy model change was inevitable for a number of reasons. There will be no 1.27 economy anymore.

&gt;2. Changes in the income are mostly for 0-12 levels. As you can see from tables in the OP, try it!). Check the income bonus percentage for every plane, and you see what I mean.


&gt;3. Income for 12-20 lvls remained almost the same. Really strong planes (top-tiers and jets) could be played in 'plus' only by skillful pilots. It's normal. We don't want dozens of MiG-15 in every battle. Playing the strong plane is challenging


&gt;4. Income is growing from level to level for all players of any skill from 0 to 10th level.


&gt;5. You won't play in 'minus' till levels 10-12 now. If you're newcomer, ask about repairing costs in percentage of income. This is over now. Even totally unlucky and failed battle will bring you some lions. Your personal combat skills are not so valuable before ~10-12 lvl, you may fly bad and still earn - it just takes more time.

&gt;6. You may easily develop and buy one branch of a tech tree from 0 to 12 lvl in accordance (more or less) to your XP level. New level - new plane. No some extraordinary combat skills required for this. Want more planes, or play better, or buy Premium. Fair? Fair.


&gt;So, we do. There will be changes - more or less obvious - in gameplay (accordingly, in economy), there will be fixes and corrections, of course, but the whole idea will remain for now.

So, because with this nerf Gaijin is basically requiring that at some point down the road, you are going to have to purchase Lions (that is unless you have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to grind out Lions).

To get the ball rolling on sharing some of those
- If you're coming in a little hot then lowering your gear and landing flaps will help
- After landing once the repair timer is active you can move around the runway without resetting it - just don't take off. To do this throttle gently and control your direction with the rudder. This can be useful if you've landed but the enemy is attacking.    
- After you have repaired you can leave your aircraft
you start with altitude and speed
you avoid that take off period of being a sitting duck.    
you can change plane if appropriate.

1372452711.0,1h9t39,[TL;DR ALERT!] My thoughts on Heavy Bombers,wrel_,43,7,58,"I’m a fan of strategic bombing, but here are some key flaws that I have found that really prohibit someone from playing as a heavy bomber. (For a frame of reference


- Lack of Survivability

It’s an unavoidable fact, Wellingtons, He 111s, on and on.  When people see one, they target it.  It’s big, it’s slow, and in the current game model, but it appears that only manifested itself as strength against collision/rams and bullets that are .50 caliber and lower; cannons still take them apart.  They can last a bit longer in HB because the enemy doesn’t know at the start of the match if there is a heavy bomber present

As a heavy bomber, as the maps are big, but not realistically big enough to allow for a steady descent without building a lot of speed.  The real problem though, is the gun crew.  Even fully maxed out, bomber gunners aren’t very intimidating.  When attacking a bomber, I’ve never once said “this is going to be rough…” when I went in for my strafing run.  You usually know when they start shooting and where the tracers are coming from, and can easily move along their arc to avoid them.  They are more formidable in HB, solid hits to knock someone out

All-in-all, out-turn or out-gun the fighters looking to knock you out of the sky.   You can hope they don’t see you, and when they do, hope they ignore you, and when they don't, hope they can’t climb as high as you, and when they can, and when they can't


- Lack of Offense

This might be more applicable to the Arcade matches I’ve played, it took hundreds of bombers dropping thousands of bombs to reliably destroy designated targets.  This was mostly a technology limitation, as they were dropping unguided bombs through cross winds, and before the invention of the Norden bombsight.  It feels that War Thunder chose this type of bombing approach when it comes to the potency of strategic bombing.  I can take my B-17 with its 16x 500lb bombs, fly right down the heart of the enemy runway and drop everything I have and have them all hit home, and I’ll still need to make three or four more passes with a full bomb load before I’ve actually bombed the base out.  Granted you could coordinate with some people, and have three or four players fly their heavies in formation to totally ravage the air field, imagine how many people will flock if they see a bomber box moving across the map.  

These two problems are essentially in a symbiotic relationship with each other, in that you’ll need to survive multiple interceptor attacks *and* make several runs as your target.  That’s what I find so inherently discouraging about strategic bombers.  Which takes me nicely to my final point.


- Lack of Strategic Targets

Forgive me for being patronizing here, but for an easy way to think of it is “destroying a tactical target will win the battle, destroying a strategic target will win the war”.  A tactical target could be a column of enemy tanks headed to flank your ground forces, while a strategic target would be the steel mills and factories where the tanks are made.  Destroying the tank column will win the battle, but destroying the ability for the enemy to make more tanks will win the war.

With that said, AA vehicles, patrol boats, destroyers etc.  Small, mobile targets that are *far* lower than your bomber will be flying.  It’s almost impossible to hit them, because of the travel time your bombs will have.  Granted there are AAA nests and pillboxes, but these targets are all tactical targets, get low and dive, you’re left with the enemy base in Arcade battles, something small not all that meaningful in a game mode that has devolved down to a dogfighting race between players.  And atop all that

The Battle of the Bulge HB has the right start of an idea, it’s usually player vs player in a race to kill everyone off so the game ends sooner.  If there were more targets that you could go after and actually influence the game outcome, I think it would be a much more attractive option for players to fly their bombers.  Maybe make a map where the heavies can focus on supply lines and refineries, while the fighter bombers go low and take out tanks and enemy pilots.  Maybe if you can damage these supply lines, enemies are handcuffed while trying to repair or rearm at their base.  Maybe if you destroy the refinery, planes in the air start losing fuel and can’t stay aloft as long.  Something that will split the attention away from a mass rush to boom and zoom in the middle and once your whole team is dead because they are stupid, in comes a lonely Wellington who gets trained by all the fighters looking for the last kill.  And make these strategic targets rewarding to damage.  I realize flying a slow circle over a target at 28,500 feet in the middle


So that wasn’t too bad, then you probably have some comments and ideas of your own on the subject, and I’d love to discuss them with people.  As I said when I started all this, I really want to like playing as a heavy bomber.  But I think things really need a fix before we’re allowed to.

And so does anyone on this subreddit with all that cool gear know anyone who flew in WW2 and would be up to trying something like this?

http://forum.gaijinent.com/index.php?/topic/15833-where-are-all-the-american-flag-decals/



For those of you who would rather not click the link:

Look, alcohol, and guns. I've been flying American planes during my stay on War Thunder because I feel that is the only way to play the game, considering America is the only country playable that has actually won any of these world wars that have happened. You might say that the United Kingdom and Russia technically won the wars as well, but only by technicalities. Either way, that is beside the point and irrelevant.
 
The point is that there are no American flag decals. How am I supposed to show off my patriotism without being able to cover my plane in American flags? How am I supposed to support my country if I cannot cover my planes with American flags? Sure, I feel that this is very important for the War Thunder market to expand into America. All I'm asking for is a simple American flag decal. We've earned the right to fly our digital flags on our digital planes after becoming back to back world war champs.
 
I'm not asking for a huge change in the game
 
While I'm at it

* American planes fly around with a large American flag being dragged behind them.
* American planes explode into red
* Rounds shot from American planes are now shooting stars.
* American planes with the American flag decal are invulnerable.
* Add Hiroshima as a playable campaign mission and include atomic bombs.
* Whenever an American plane scores the final blow
* Whenever an American plane scores the first strike
* American planes can never be placed on opposite teams in arcade mode.
* Players who choose Japan must apologize for Pearl Harbor at the start of each match before being allowed to spawn.
* American pilots also all have assault weapons that they can take out and shoot from the pilot seat when they are reloading their weapons because the Assault *Weapons Ban wasn't instituted until 1994.
* All American planes renamed to Freedom. For example: P-40E-1 Freedom
* When American bombs explode, and blue smoke and also launches fireworks into the air that form into an American flag. Any non-*American planes that fly through the flag explode.
* Players who shoot down American planes are fined all of their current silver lions (out of respect).
* The end of all matches should fade into an American flag waving in the wind
* France is never a playable nation.
* Canada is also never a playable nation.
* Any references to France in the game are removed
* Players can choose Sonic the Hedgehog to pilot all of their planes (I just really like Sonic).
 
That's all I have to suggest. Thanks for reading and taking my suggestions into consideration.

1372760776.0,1hhm48,On the P51-D's In-Game Performance...,lordfuzzywig,41,8,86,"50% legitimate concern

I've had the P51-D for a while now. I love it. I love everything about it. It was the one plane I was looking forward to having in the American tree. But because of the previously-broken FM, biplanes).*

So I went and did some looking.

Here are some stats from various websites regarding the P51's performance:

**Maximum Speed ASL 358mph = 576kph.**

    At 3KM (10k ft) 
    437 mph = 703.2 kph

    At 7km (25k ft)
    325 mph = 523.03 kph

    3475 feet per minute climb = 17.6m/s

And I've only found stats that actually indicate that these numbers might be on the low end. Why does the P51 literally struggle ASL in-game to even reach 400kph when Emils, Tonys, Yaks, and almost every other low-tier plane not only reach that speed easily but also maintain that speed with literally no effort required?

The Me109F4
     
    Low blower operation man. press ""Hg 60.5

    To 20000 ft at Combat Power

Turn times were reported to be about three seconds longer than FWs and similar planes

Here are some graphs to illustrate the point.

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-comp-perf-chart1.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-turning.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-dive.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustang-level-150-2.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustang-level-67.jpg

So the question is why is this plane so awfully under-represented? **Is the FM still broken? If so

Why is a Buffalo literally a better, for example, which I feel has a fairly complete FM, has a max speed of around 410mph (650kph) and this is actually pretty accurately modelled so far.

The Mustang was highly regarded as one of the best planes of the war

tl;dr just click the graphs and look at how the P51 should be performing to how it compares in-game.

This post is going to detail the RDDT squadron's road map of milestones and events we want to accomplish. These are things we need help with

**1. Organization**

We're accepting everyone who applies to join to be a member of Reddit. We are an inclusive Squadron open to all just like this subreddit

Once we near the membership cap for the squadron

[**Here's a graphic example.**](http://imgur.com/a/kDTkU)

We will be holding elections on the sub for anyone who wants to volunteer to be an officer. Officers will be managerial positions within the Squadron that are responsible for coordinating the members of the organization and running or keeping tack of those volunteers who are running the below events. 

****

**2. Gaming Events**

We plan to eventually offer all of the following- but we need help to organize and run them. Please let us know if you're interested in helping with any of these.

* Inner-RDDT tournaments and Open-to-anyone tournaments (Arcade
* Custom Events- Inner RDDT and Open (Historic and Full Real)
* Tactical-focused Custom Battles
* Organized matchmaking squads
* Flight school
* Monthly gaming challenges (EX. Get 3 air kills and 5 ground kills without dying in a match).
* Flying guides for all the planes and maps.
* FRB demo teams
* A wingman system for RDDT events- rank up by proving your flying skills to be promoted to a flight leader!
 
****

**3. Future Growth**

We are looking into the feasbility of doing the following:

* A private RDDT teamspeak.
* Gaijin-sponsored contests

****

Lastly, and elections will be coming soon!

Tonight we're going to do a custom battle 10v10 to try it out- rules are up in the air right now so if you have suggestions you're welcome to put them forward. Custom battles don't give or cost any lions

To start off:

* When: 9PM Eastern TONIGHT

* Where: The RDDT teamspeak

* Scenario: Battle of Midway (US vs Japan) 10 vs 10

* US Planes Allowed (historically present): 
   1. PBY Catalina
   1. SBD Dauntless
   1. TBF Avenger
   1. F2A Buffalo
   1. F4F-3 Wildcat
   1. F4F-4 Wildcat

* Japanese Planes Allowed (historically present): 
  1. A6M2 ""Zero""
  1. A6M3 ""Zero""
  1. A6M2-N ""Rufe""
  1. D3A1 Dive Bomber ""Val""
  1. B5N2 Torpedo bomber ""Kate""

We'll see how many people we get and divide the teams, and then get a consensus if we want to adjust any rules, keep playing Midway, or change anything up. More details to come regarding game password, I'll post in in TS for those who show up.

1376440856.0,1kbf3p,TIP: Escaping enemy aircraft,Ferrariic,38,4,74,"They're many good pilots out there but the best pilots are able to escape enemies and trick them to leave you alone. Here are some tips for you guys planning to live through your next encounter. 

TIP 1: Out run or come to a stop. Simple, various other planes won't be able to get you, be agile. If your plane is slower, use that. Reduce your speed or force a stall, don't raise your altitude but keep a steady turn, the aircraft behind you will pick up speed and pass you. You may now escape or chase. 

TIP 2: maneuvers. 
If you have a light aircraft hold down Q A and S, get closer to the ground as you can use the unpredictability and lack of safety to your advantage here. Other planes will try to follow but will have to follow carefully or risk crashing. For bombers, you are basically Sky Titans, all you need to do is not fly straight, you are slow as it is so don't pick up speed, other planes will easily chase and shoot you down. Staying straight also allows rockets to shoot you down easily. 

TIP 3: Feign death. 
Got a broken elevator or wing? Use to to your advantage

1. Planes

 a. The p-51 mustang turned the tide of the air war upon its production. This plane matched or bettered all of the Luftwaffe's aircraft. The p-51 performs like a wet dog shaking its coat out and is generally despicable. There aren't even any variants of this plane yet they give is 2 airacobras and 3 kingcobras that were almost all flown by the Russians?

 b. B-17. This plane (and almost all other bombers) simply pop to any gun larger than a 50cal. At one point today I asked a 109-g2 (2 km away) if I could drop my bombs before he raped me. Both wings

 c. BF109-G6 A great plane. I understand why every German pilot has this plane in their lineup and do not argue with the way it performs. I do however believe that this plane is not at the correct level as it out classes EVERY other plane at lvl 13. In addition it has the highest reward bonus of any fighter at lvl 13 in the game at 140% thus increasing its abuse.

2. General USA/Japan high level planes. Where are they? The US have three planes above lvl 14

3. Me bitching. broken economy. loads of free exp. sales to gobble down any existing lions. expert training costs too much. CHARGING EAGLES FOR ACE TRAINING!? if the inflation on planes continues they will be charging first born babies and virgins soon. costs on training crew for high lvl aircraft is not worth it. 

I would like to see this game succeed and I love playing it game but things need to change. There are absolutely op nations that everyone should play. No nation should have that much of an advantage but instead each race should have a historically accurate slight edge that attracts players based on their style of play. All nations should have WELL ROUNDED air forces with similar lvl planes performing EQUALLY. I understand this is hard to balance with historical accuracy but this seems to me the only fair way to balance it. Finally

1374753680.0,1j0ta4,Armament and what people seem to forget about it (Long Post),ScrubWTPlayer,53,19,45,"***TL:DR*** Bulletproof glass thick enough to reliably stop 7.62 and 12.7mm fire was only in small areas to the front and back due to the huge weight of bulletproof glass, most if not all the weapons in the game are probably LESS effective in many cases than they really should be.

Also

***************************

I've noticed a lot of complaints about cannons being over powered

First

Today, they only used it just in front and behind the pilot, everything else was thinner, lighter, and weaker material. In addition, not all aircraft even used bulletproof glass at all, for example in the P47's case, info on bulletproof windshield in P47D section towards bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_47_Thunderbolt)

For the actual armament

Although there is different length cartridges, if one of the crew got hit, they would likely go down, or at least would have a lot of trouble continuing to fly/shoot/whatever their job is. Given the information above on bulletproof glass, I'd say that being hit in the front or back of the canopy should have a fairly low chance of killing the pilot, but anywhere else, the bullet would have plenty of stopping power to incapacitate or kill them.

Next let's move on to .50 Caliber

Compared to a .30-06, it it would have a higher chance of penetrating the front and back bullet proof glass, but how often it did so would probably depend on the thickness of the glass used. Again, hits other than the front/back that hit the pilot would be very likely to kill/incapacitate them. In addition, pretty much any fighter, even those with relatively high armor (*for a fighter*) should be able to be torn apart by these bad boys.

Last let's take a look at 20mm and above (grouping these to keep the post from being longer than it already is)

A simple 20mm round has roughly 50 kilojoules muzzle energy [20mm Cannon info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber), and decent damage to ones that are heavily armored. Anything above that and you start to get ridiculous, 30mm and above should heavily damage anything you can get to stay in the air. Their effect on the pilot would depend on what type of round was used; while an AP round from a cannon would probably have good penetration on most bulletproof glass pieces, an HE 20mm round with little actual penetration hitting the BPG one time could possibly be survivable. Again on the flip side anywhere other than the areas protected by the BPG would almost surely result in a dead pilot. 

Here is an image of the effects of a Mk108 30mm cannon hit on a Blenheim to give a visual idea of the power: [30mm Mk108 Effect](http://en.valka.cz/files/mk-108_blenheim.jpg)

Wow. /u/Commander_Adama and I *definitely* did not see this coming so quickly. We'd like to thank you all for coming and being a part of this!

Today we've hit 1, we didn't have Full Real Battles, the game was still in closed beta, and very few of us actually had access to it.

Now we've got distinct subcommunities flying Arcade games, [as you can see here!](http://i.imgur.com/ygbSgn2.png)

**ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CHANGES**

___

We've been running with 6 rules for the last few months and have recently added a seventh: 

- **When submitting game-mode-specific content (such as requests for help in flying in Arcade mode, [HB] or [FRB].**

This one is to make it easier to identify what game mode we're talking about in a thread, etc. There are significant differences in gameplay and airplane performance across the three game modes, so it helps greatly if you use a tag in your title!

If you have any thoughts on our current rules

Please do not use the **report** button if the comment you'd wish to report isn't spam, or against our subreddit rules. Do not use the button as a super-downvote, it's annoying. You're all mature enough to come here and endure a little dirty language and disagreement.

___

Over the past month we've added three sites as resources for helping you start out in War Thunder and improve your tactics and knowledge.

1. **[The official War Thunder Wiki](http://warthunder.wikia.com/wiki/War_Thunder_Wiki)**

2. **[The Complete Beginner's Guide to War Thunder](http://www.kiasa.org/2013/02/12/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-war-thunder/)**

3. **[Dogfighting Instructional Videos](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/10709-dogfighting-instructional-videos/)** (fixed link)

If for any reason you don't feel one of these isn't worth its place there, do say so.

___

**All of you are welcome to add the RDDT_ tag to your ingame handles!**

With no official inclusion of clans/squadrons yet, RDDT is a premier clan wars-participating clan, and RDDT could certainly go for a leading role as a clan in War Thunder too (considering our numbers).

1376016342.0,1k02lc,My Analysis of US Prop Fighters / Discussion,tipsy3000,34,5,46,"Ok I finally hit the milestone of lv 13 for the US fighters

- Bigger payloads
- More range
- More diverse payloads/weapon load-outs
- Tougher aircraft

Really as you go further up the US becomes more and more of the king of multipurpose aircraft, nor that much better at climbing. Literally here is the best example of this...

- F4F-3 - T5 fighter, ok turning, ok firepower
- P47-D25 - T9 Fighter, poor turning, good firepower
- P51-D5- T13 fighter, ok turning, good firepower

Literally Iv flown each of these planes in succession and the only difference I ever saw was that the jump to the P47 gave me a faster plane with piss poor acceleration then the jump to the P51 gave me a fast plane with ok acceleration but all 3 still sucked at climbing. We are talking a 4 Tier gap between these planes and they all almost play exactly alike if it wasnt for the ever increasing range

Now your probably saying ""Hey Tipsy why didnt you mention the good aircraft you know the P63/F4U1D?!"" Im glad you asked. Since 1.33 both the F4U1D which is T8 and the P63-A10 (fastest of the 3) which is T9 got improved FM which are more accurate

When you compare this to a similar increase in the UK line you see actual improvements from each aircraft as you go up in the line.

- SpitMK2 T6 - poor speed, ok firepower
- SpitMK5 T8 - good speed, ok firepower
- SpitfMK9 T10 - great speed, good firepower (more munitions)
- SpitMK16 T11 Great speed, good firepower

The line is shorter between aircraft

The game right now, the US has no hope. Their extended range is useless on all maps because the battle ends in a single sortie under 30 minutes. Their expansive and heavy payloads again are pointless where victory is claimed by plane kills not ground attack. Really right now its all about climb speed and air to air firepower, whoever can hit 6k meters first and fastest has a massive chance of winning. This is something the US does not specialize in, this is why they tend to get badly stomped unless they take massive amounts of time to climb, and work together and work efficiently. Even then as the game stands now it negates really one of the cool advantages of the US fighters with its really diverse load-out options, which if you equip any in the current game youll get called a noob or a dummy for loading bombs/rockets.

There is one other advantage the US line should have but isnt shown in game

Anywho I wanted to throw this out there

1370892704.0,1g2c53,How to bomb bases in a fully loaded B-17E,TomCollins7,33,4,15,"Good morning

Now first, it's important to figure out the approximate distance to target. Maps such as Berlin suburbs are very long, and it takes more time to reach the base, whereas in maps such as Africa Canyon or Rice Terraces, you are on the enemy base as nearly as the game starts. 

The second thing we do when the round starts is to get lighter. We do this by dropping our payload

Now that we're light, which will bring the B-17 to 118% power. I like to climb at a 30 degree angle when wepping. In AB, wepping lasts about 30 secs and there is no penalty for continually using it. It cannot be overstated that climbing in the B-17 is your life blood, which brings us to the next point. 

In a fighter, in order to surive, you press 'S'. Do not turn. Do not dive. Only by climbing while WEPping can you hope to survive. If an enemy comes upon you, you want to get them onto your tail. This is where you will record most of your kills, especially if they assualt you while climbing to you, that is, while you are above them. This robs them of energy making them easier targets to hit. 

Ok, make sure you use the zoom option, which is defaulted to 'Z'. In order to stabilize your sights when dropping bombs, you may want to use combat flaps and cut power to 50% or so. You don't need to do this if you've lined up the airfield for a parralel run, but it is useful on your initial approach, when the airfield can be perpendicular to your approach vector. 

Once you've dropped your initial 8 bombs across their landing strip

Right then, switch to bomb view and see that your crosshairs are angling at a substantial--but steady rate--off center. 

The key to a good, turn slightly against the bank and add some more power. DO NOT drop your bombs if you are wobbling out of control. Only when you are smooth is it worth dropping. Then again--if you run out of runway target, drop the entire load. Better to wait for them to reload and climb than to hold onto useless deadweight. 

Once you whip out of your turn, pull hard up and towards the direction you had been previously turning. Keep climbing and turning until you are again going directly away from the runway. After dropping your bombs, DO NOT CONTINUE TO FLY PAST THE RUNWAY. This will make your setup time faster by 1.5. The fastest way to drop bombs and reload is to fly in a circle. 

I find that on solo missions, it will take about 4000lbs more to finish the job. Do not demand an escort. You are not entitled to one. If you are bombing with a friend in a B-17, do not stay in formation when you are over the target. Rather, split in separate directions so that you are harder to kill.

1365194984.0,1brado,[ARCADE]Major price-cost-performance disparity with tiered Japanese planes compared to everyone else's.,KazumaKat,37,3,25,"I've just ended what is to be a 4-day long Japanese-only stint which quickly became a test of endurance

what I've found after returning to normally sceduled War Thunder is that the Japanese are obviously over-tiered and underperforming. This is evident when I checked my records wherein I actually **lost money** playing the Japanese because of all the mishaps and failures I've gained

The things I've found:

* T7 Zero rolls slower than a bomber at its arcade speeds. This is historically accurate and there are techniques designed to nullify this to an extent, is a bygone era by its tier, due to the strong performing Germans, Americans, and obviously the Russians with their far superior energy fighters.

* KI-61 Ia and Ib at tiers 5 and 6 perform adequately against tiered combatants, they cannot maintain that performance as long as a true energy fighter.

* Default Japanese ammunition loadouts are horrificly inadequate against the targets they are shooting at. This combined with the KI-61's tendency to rudder-waver at its combat speeds and the horrificly bad roll characteristics of the Zero means that if you do score a hit, German, British, and Russian plane.

* It is historically accurate that Japanese planes are known to be flamers, with the ranking the Zero has, its already fighting aircraft that historically speaking already were an era ahead and were designed to take down the Zero. Case in point. The F6F Hellcat, colloquially known as the Zero Killer, is a T6 USA. The first Zero, the A6M2, is a T7. Do the math.

What I'm seeing so far is that the Zero line at least needs to be tiered down

When the long awaited 1.29 update came out it was a sudden change to the flowing game play of 1.27 although in quite a few respects the game improved after a few micro patches and i thought great they are improving on an already great game.

Lately however with the release of 1.31 all I can see gaijin doing with the game is plowing it into the ground as hard and as fast as they can in order to make as much money in a short time as possible. The new economy model makes it virtually pointless to go anywhere past tier 9 without waiting days of real time for aircraft to repair. Now my games consist of me trying desperately not to die so I don't have to pay what are stupidly high repair costs for planes i worked hard to purchase and now cant even use.

I usually only fly HB now anyways since trying to do the objectives on arcade doesn't seem to matter anymore and 99% of the games im getting have 4+ ai on either side so the 5-6 real players who are actually in game rush straight to the enemy ai to get easy kills and the match becomes a low level furball that ends in under 10 minutes. 

The new 1.31 patch I haven't seen a single thing that improves the game play it only makes it harder to earn lions and it wasn't that easy before 1.31

All of the people I knew that i brought to play the game have long since gone and i doubt I will stay much longer if they keep making the game unplayable for those people who don't have large amounts of spare cash to throw at the game.

I know this game is still in ''Beta'' but I haven't seen it even go slightly in the right direction since 1.27 its heading away from what a game should be

* Looking at how to solve technical and secrecy-issues with user-submitted models

* Rocket planes may get lowered tier. If not; likely to get lowered repairs in HB/FRB

* FM team will strive to provide a bit more detailed notes for the patch logs

* More customizability to airplane loadout will come

* No separate game mode for heavy bomber missions. However more types of targets

* Rewards like kill streaks and bomber/fighter rescue will start giving lions instead of XP

* Economy will be tweaked further soon

* Forced bail-out timer in Arcade only occurs for engine being dead

* Force-tilting/flipping planes with wingtip should be tested. Functionality of feature unsure.

* Achievements and other things that have to do with player level will be added. Please contribute with suggestions for things players can strive for

* Planes with larger crews (bombers) may get ability to replace unconcious pilot. Will be tested in Army (tanks) mode before possible future implementation.

* Selling planes will require the economy to change to REQUIRE you to sell planes to progress fast (like in World of Tanks). Such a change is not a goal of Gaijin. They want people to keep all planes

* Other payment options limited because it could mean different prices for the same amount of eagles. European customers not used to that.

* Adding new game modes won't happen until there is a playerbase the size that supports it

* HB will not be split depending on control mode (mouse or joystick)

* The LumberYak video probably a result of what items are collided with

* Pilot-controlled guns on bombers will (likely) get ammo belt variations. Might happen for turret gunners

* Internal review on likelyhood/presence of bad weather

* Reason for reduced XP gain on maxed plane is that the crew is so good [at that plane] that they cannot really learn more from flying it.

* Community Translation Project upcoming

* Britain will get new high-tier single-engine planes in the near future (Spitfire Mk.XXI?)

* Cargo planes will not be added until the current release tech trees have been completed

* 'Reconnect to battle'-function is planned

* Potential addition of ""Punish? Yes/No"" system for teamkilling

1375676614.0,1jpz5l,What's Wrong With Arcade?,Desdichado,39,12,74,"[A simple example](http://i.imgur.com/3rm53wV.jpg)

After more than 300 hours of playtime in Arcade

1)  The first is a gross imbalance between the effectiveness of killing ground targets vs killing planes in terms of their effects on winning the match.  Killing other players has virtually no influence on winning the match in arcade.  This is because the matches are so short, killing ground targets directly contributes to victory through reduction of the enemy's 'tickets'.

2)  You cannot defend ground targets in arcade.  Sure one may get the lucky pilot snipe

3)  Domination rewards players who are willing to recklessly attempt a landing on an enemy-held airfield.  What conceivable analogue does this gameplay mechanic have to historical fighter combat?  Rhetorical question, by definition, do not do.

Therefore, makes you a liability to your team since you're not a) killing ground targets or b) landing on airfields, which are the two ways to win an arcade match.  Personally, I do not find this desirable.  If I wanted to play a PvE game, I wouldn't need to be online to do it.  I do wonder, however, what the point is of building an air combat simulator that marginalizes air-to-air combat in the most used game mode.

My proposal:  Allowing air kills to reduce the opponent's tickets.   I believe this would go a long way toward balancing the two playstyles in arcade.",self,t5_2uc6j,False,arcade-discussion,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1jpz5l/whats_wrong_with_arcade/

&gt;Recently during KRI show (Conference of Russian Game developers) Pavel Kulikov
  
* **Q: Ground Forces: release date and gameplay**

 * **A:** Ground Units will come this year. Recently we’ve published a Teaser, surely we will  make combats for both airplanes and ground units controlled by the players on the same map, but still we will provide the opportunities for our players to take part in airplane-only or ground-force-only games. The tab “army” will be available then, with its own tech trees and so on. Yet I cannot tell anything about certain ground unit classes, there is a huge amount of gameplay, that we are still testing.  Classic tanks will surely be introduced, but concerning the other types of ground units I can not tell now – it is all being tested for now. And we are working hard on the Fleet issue, and we had showed the screenshots of the ships already
 
* **Q: What should the players expect from the nearest patches?**
 * **A:** First of all the new patch will introduce the clan system. There will be leaderboards. so the players will have the opportunity to find out the one who is not only the best player
 
  * We are also going to update the debrief window interface
 
* **Q: Night fights and missions.**

   * **A:** We have already night fights, we're thinking about adding radars, but we have to test them well before adding into the gameplay.


* **Q: 'Schräge Musik' – will it be introduced and

 * **A:** The idea of angled weapons is interesting
 
* **Q: When will the controls be finalized?**

 * **A:** Optimization of game controls is a very fluid process. Our patent-pending mouse aim system was extremely good from the very beginning, much more are to come. One of the upcoming updates will bring response curves available from the interface, for example. Our guideline here is our players' feedback – we're trying to make our controls comfortable for all War Thunder pilots.
 
* **Q: Bomber cockpits**

 * **A:** Bombers’ cockpits gonna be added as soon as they are ready, one of them “Peshka” has already been shown. And one more thing – you have nothing to worry about, we are not going to copy the same cockpit for different modifications of one plane, they gonna be original for every craft.
 
* **Q: New nations.**

 * **A:** Concerning new nations to be introduced – next ones will be the Italians. They already have some biplanes, as soon as we introduce top planes (they're being developped now), the Italians will become a separate Nation to play. France will be introduced after Italy.
 
**Summary:**

So this year we will introduce ground units, Android and iOS versions are in development, this year is very promising and we have surprises for you yet to be announced.",[News],False,self,t5_2uc6j,news,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1eoz4p/news_interview_with_pavel_kulikov_war_thunders/

 People really need to SHUT.THE.FUCK.UP about the flight models. I have sat in on the team speak of the FM development group for a day and the things they are doing is for all intensive purposes rocket science (or aeronautical engineering if you prefer) .Flight models are not some list of data points you fill out. You dont type into the code ""hurr have a turn time of 25 seconds"" ""hurr turn down the climb rate"".  You have to physically model the plane in a mathmatic environment (not a graphical environment) to have the proper wing loading 

The russians are not and I quote ""purposely buffing their planes cuz they are russian"". Thats asinine horse shit that only an edgy teenager could think up. The LA series was simply one of the planes this patch that had an error in it that was either undetected or detected too late in development to delay the patch. 

Like I said  

This is a beta , there will be glitches , and there will be errors in the flight models.  

I dont care If you ""spent your hard earned money blah blah blah im entitled""  

The reason they make you pay for beta access isnt so they can sell you the game early

It allows me to see around the cockpit and keep my combat awareness. Also

I realize that there are better programs out there. Yet for a free webcam only face tracker that works this well I'm surprised. If you haven't used a head tracker before I would highly suggest trying this one out and see how you like it. It takes flying to a whole new level.

(I neglected to specify which mode (Arcade,000 lions to repair if shot down in HB.)

[Setting The Scene]

Imagine you are a pilot who likes to fly mainly US planes, lacks the fire power to bring down the multitude of similarly leveled Russian and German planes. Now that the scene is set, lets begin our story.

You've entered matchmaking with a total faction level of 13 and after several minutes (Usually 3-4 minutes) you finally get placed into a match. You get lucky and end up with a good ground strike map with some good bombing weather and no clouds, scoring a multitude of hits on his wings and engines. Though what should appear to be an easy victory on your part slowly becomes a horrifying realization, the enemy fighter won't go down. He continues to line up his guns and releases a few short burst from his guns, and to your own horror your B-17 decides that it doesn't like flying much anymore and splits in two. You crash before you could even get your payload on target and end up 20,000 Lions poorer than before (assuming you are gong to repair the plane). Now repeat this process every time you want to play your expensive B-17 and thats what its like now. A waste of time and effort. The only way you could possibly hope to support planes like this is through Premium and copious purchasing of Gold Eagles.

Am I the only one who sees it as laughably obvious that the flight models for the Brewster Buffalo and the Republic P-47 are simply switched?

The purchased German P-47 was my first Fly-It-Dozens-of-Times plane

I clawed my way up to the US P-47

But behold, in about 20 seconds of normal acceleration.

Now, He-112, Hyabusa, etc.

But don't worry

But on the plus side

Which should obviously be how the P-47 performs

**STRATEGIC EDIT:**
I definitely derailed my point before it even began with two cheap shots against the premium FW 190 D-13.  I will be the first to admit this isn't fair to pilots who earned their way up to the required rank.  

Worse, one of my first go-to planes that I flew to get comfortable was the German P-47, a premium plane!  Admittedly the plane is basically a disadvantage but the reverse could easily have been true.

What I'm really mad at is not D-13 pilots, please.

Questions about future development will not be answered!

&gt;  Q: 2x daily bonus does not seem to give anything?

A: Will be checked with developers.

&gt;  Q: Why plane of same tiers does not have same cost and repair cost?

A: Variant, weapon rating are all factors to take. It is very hard to place planes to tier to exactly match each other. Sptfire MkI and Bf-109E-3 are good match because they fought each other, but E-3 had an edge on Spitfire.

&gt;  Q: Did Bf-109s were altered in last 1.29 patch?

A: Small tweaks in FM were done

&gt;  Q: How about adding more realism to arcade vs making arcade fun?

A: Arcade is supposed to be fun and it is probably going to stay like that but there is no definitive answer to that.

&gt;  Q: On HB mayor problem is you are stuck with one faction. Friend went other way

A: When WW mode comes out everything is going to change.It is very hard to explain to all players that we are playing only 20% of the game at the moment.

&gt;  Q: Some different map in HB were on and it was great to break monotony but now they are not?

A: Some maps have bugs and developers are working on them. As soon as they are fixed

&gt; Q: What was the reason behind backup planes?

A: A lot of people were pushing to have two of same aircraft and to be able to be used in same battle. And option to do it was added.

&gt;  Q: Do you think HB now have too much downtime during battle (takeoff

A: That is the way how it is done, downtime is part of game and was much more in real life.

&gt;  Q: What happened with economy and why is economy like this now?

A: Basically, people come to game, bomb targets, leave the game or kamikaze not being punished at all. Now economy is set to eradicate that. Also, every economy change need to run for at least a week for data gathering before any decision is made. So, don't worry about economy too much, it will be changed for sure again and again.

&gt;  Q: Do you guys have any plans about wipeout after beta?

A: No

&gt;  Q: Would it be possible to get notice prior to patch itself?

A: It is not possible. Notes will be more informative

&gt;  Q: Premium user in todays economy cannot afford planes because XP is much more that lions. Why premium user does not get more money and less experience? XP gain outlevel lions by far.

A: Will be passed to devs and balance checked.

&gt; Q: Do you have plans to make harder arcade mode (with more realistic flight models)

A: Nothing is planned at this moment. Developers feel there is no need for now to introduce new game mode.

&gt; Q: Bomb load of some bombers in the game is lower than what bombers could take in real life?

A: That was done intentionally because of balance and necessity to stop bombers from killing all ground units in one pass.

&gt; Q: Yer-2 and why it carries more bombs then any other bomber in game?

A: Have to be checked with developers

&gt; Q: Do you have plan to add more area targets for tactical and strategic bombers?

A: There are some great ideas about that and dev team is investigating new types of targets for strategic and tactical bombing.

&gt; Q: Any plans to introduce assets from the single missions and campaigns into arcade mode

A: New maps are in development and are coming when they are ready (have been tested).

&gt; Q: Tu2 is in the bomber line

A: Their line will be revisited soon

&gt; Q: We had a new damage system in hb

A: There was some bugs in it and it will be back in the next patch.

&gt; Q: Can we expect more in depth info about the planes?

A: They will be updated shortly.

&gt; Q: Why is AAA's super accurate? how can they track you from +10km ?

A: When it becomes player controlled your going to see a whole different ball game.

&gt; Q: Why do we earn about 1/5 xp when the planes experience bar is full? any changes?

A: Its all about game balance

&gt; Q: Why is domination mode so rare?

A: Post it on the forum and it will be taken to the developers.

&gt; Q: There is different kinds of bombs where can i find more info about the diffrent kind of bombs?

A: It will be put on the forum tomorrow (03-23)

&gt; Q: Why cant we adjust the gun convergence in arcade?

A: Fill a bug report on the forum.

&gt; Q: Will you give us the option to add/delete guns?

A: No

&gt; Q: Rockets for German planes?

A: It will come eventually

&gt; Q: Are gunners going to be a bit more effective?

A: Try and switch to the gunners yourself

&gt; Q: Why cant we see what ammo is in the 'default' ammo type?

A: Its a bug and will be fixed soon

&gt; Q: Is the ammo velocity reflected?

A: Yes.

&gt; Q: Are there going to be any changes to the instructor?

A: Yes

&gt; Q: Will the economy be changed?

A: Yes.

&gt; Q: Do you have statistics about how long it takes for a player to go from 0-12 and what planes should a level 12 player have?

A: We do have statistics but we can't really tell you.

&gt; Q: Why is there a huge gaps in the current Russian tech tree.

A: More planes will be added

&gt; Q: Will the levels be 'historic' etc planes who fought each other is the same level?

A: Yes

&gt; Q: Why is there icons telling me who is friendly and the enemy?

A: We had a patch where there was no icons and it brought the whole fighting to the ground

&gt; Q: Is there any plans on giving bombers some bonus? etc pilot die

A: This will be taken to the developers.

&gt; Q: Is there any plans to introduce a 4th game mode?

A: Thera are no current plans of introducing a 4th game mode.

&gt; Q: Is there a plan to create a 4th mode

A: There are currently no plans to create an additional game

&gt; Q: Are there any plans to support Linux?

A: Yes

&gt; Q: Fuel count doesn't go down in Arcade. Is there actual fuel in Arcade battles?

A: There is fuel. However

&gt; Q: Clan functionality: We have a lot of buddies with the RDDT tag and many more who could benefit from a separate clan channel. What's going on with the clans feature? (He also asked about clan registration and such to prevent copies with clan tags)?

A: The clan feature is upcoming and I believe it will be implemented in the next upcoming major patch. Until then

&gt; Q: After the latest patch

A: This was not intended. Submit a bug report with a screenshot attached on the newly created bug reporting section on the forums and it will be investigated.

&gt; Q: When an enemy goes above or below you while flying a bomber

A: All gunners should be a separate entity

&gt; Q: When the game goes live will we lose any of the aircrafts we have?

A: No... Not at all. There will be no wipe

&gt; Q: I've been getting a lot of connection issues lately even though I know my connection is okay on my end?

A: Please submit a bug report on the new bugs section if you are repeatedly getting bad ping and even dropouts in the game. Just make sure to comply with that section's guidelines. Another thing you can do is to untick the ""Seed After Download"" button as you will be seeding the game for other people to download while you're playing.

&gt;The cost of repair for aircraft increased

&gt;Changed calculation of damages of the plane after the fight. Now it calculates more parameters.

We have seen images and videos showcasing the repair cost changes and immediately dismissed the increased repair cost patch note as a type or translation error, as a few have noticed, the tooltip has been changed from **Max Repair Cost** to **Average Repair Cost**.  Whoa, what?  I would like to know if the new tooltip is an error, or if the max repair cost is going to be higher than the figures we are currently drooling over.  And how much higher are we talking?

And we are definitely drooling.  Depending on which way this misunderstanding goes

1. Max repair costs for most planes are significantly reduced

2. Max repair costs remain the same or similar, engines still running, intact fuelselage/wings, etc) so the average repair cost is lower *in theory*.  

Option one sounds awesome.  The prospect of breaking even or even making money flying your favorite aircraft just became a whole lot more plausible.  Hell

The second option however **will** result in backlash

Let's assume that the repair costs are the same as they are today, high altitude deaths will still result in a max repair cost in most cases, negating any real possibility of getting a break through this partial repair percentage system.  

And who is (or should be) at high altitudes consistently?  Which planes more often than not will be victims of total loss of control at high altitude?  The hangar queens are- the jets and heavy bombers.  The same people who stand to gain the most from these economy buffs.  The same people who leave their planes in the hangar because their prized plane is too expensive to repair.  The same people that are all drooling over the idea of being able to fly their favorite aircraft without needing therapy after getting shot down.  This second possibility will basically be giving everyone a break on repair bills

I have a feeling that option 2 is coming.  Please somebody prove me wrong.  Has anyone received repair bills on the dev server today who can shed some light on this?  I know that some devs hang out here too who could weigh in.  I'm begging to be proven wrong here.

Thought I should make this thread and try to help some of the newer players out there gain some perspective. There are a few things to keep in mind when after more XP points. You can read some tips [here](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/20878-mariks-flight-techniques-and-how-to-win/) and kudos to Marik for making that thread. Just scroll down and find the **EXPERIENCE** Spoiler tab. I suggest you read through the whole topic

Furthermore, than 2000-3000 points in Arcade. Not only that, but planes also behave *realistically*, and you get to experience another level of aerial combat. Arcade is very fun, while it's less rewarding to win there, both in terms of money/xp gains and of the feeling you might gain from success. At first I was very intimidated by the gameplay of HB, as well as by the lack of the little aiming circle, now that the aim-circle is gone. In fact, if any at all, as well as your nation.

Roles could be played out as so:

Pilot: all flight is AI controlled; AI follows specific

Bomberman (as i like to call Bombdropperguy): the most important person from the squad for the mission. one person from squad is responsible for using bomb sight and dropping bombs whereas required in the mission. Mainly responsible for completing the mission. Can change view from bomb sight to inside virtual cockpit (not at the pilot seat). Suggestions about bomberman subbing in as an additional gunner

Gunners: 3 of the other squad members  (4 if counting gunnerman as additional sub) are responsible for taking control of the gunnery and defending the bomber. Mainly responsible for preventing the whole squad from being shot down and failing the mission. Guns may or may not overheat or have additional ammo near them (suggestions please!). Can change views from first person to 3rd person.

The best planes to fit these missions might be PBY's, or Wellingtons, for all of them can accommodate all squad members as gunners. The remaining spots for gunners will be taken up by AI.

I think that it could also incorporate different squads into one big mission, so any thoughts?

**Explanation of the controls.**

* Left joystick is your main joystick

* Yaw is set to both bumpers

* Right joystick is free look. So you can look while piloting instead of holding down a key to look

* Left trigger is zoom

* Right is fire (Machine guns and cannons)

* Bombs is A

* Rockets is X

* View is toggles by Y

* Map is B
 
* Left stick press reloads

* Dpad UP and DOWN control throttle

* Dpad RIGHT held and Right stick press toggles flaps

* Dpad LEFT held and Right stick press toggles airbrakes

* Back/Select opens statistics

* Start pauses

- Spit MkIX, it climbs better than a 109 G2 by around 9km/h between 3000m and 4000m at 15 degrees and full WEP.

- Spit Mk I has 100 octane fuel upgrade

- Upgrade system seems ok

- Upgrade system now incorporates buying upgrades with Eagles

- 109 F4

- FW190 A5 has the option to add an extra FOUR 20mm cannons via wing pylons for a total of SIX 20mm cannons.

- FW190 F8 has the option for 30mm cannon pylons (~~or alternatively 20mm cannons I think~~). Didn't test this plane. **Only an extra 2 x 30mm cannons for this plane.**

- P47, Hellcat haven't had their updated FM's added to the dev server yet from what I could tell (no working WEP on some planes etc).

- Corsair still seems to be over climbing

- Tested a couple of RU planes

- IL4 now gets more bomb loads.

- Bearcats seem like decent planes, should be beastly with upgrades and FM tweaks. Cockpit wasn't uploaded to the dev server.

- BTD seemed rather slow

- I couldn't really test the new gunnery dynamics in matches as I seemed to be having connection issues with joining a game (450 ping from Australia, and 20mm's are also more effective. (Hispano's now have a new sound effect).

- A lot of FM's are still borked with their Engine Management options, and some other planes with superchargers did nothing with the SC turned on. FM updates should hopefully rectify this.

- I've heard the Sabre is now a beast

- Vampire currently has the Mig15 FM

- Some decals (50% of them at a guess) now cost 200 gold to use

- The crew healing skill has been replaced by a Weapon Management skill which reduces overheating/bullet spread and bomb spread. So throw your spare crew points into healing if you haven't already.

- Bomber gunners now seem more accurate

That's about all I can remember after 9 hours sleep. Here's a few screenies I took

http://imgur.com/a/gCwYW

**Additional:** Repair prices have been altered, so it sounds like they've reset the repair for a base efficiency test considering the FM and weapon changes. This is all an uneducated and uninformed guess on my part.

**Arcade missions**

*(Updated 4th April 2013)*

**[Domination] Khalkhin-Gol**

In this mission there are three airfields and a few ground units

**[Domination] Mozdok**

Same mission with the three airfields and ground units but there are some defenses and fortifications in the center of map.  Also map looks like the historical place.

Then dev speaks about the suburbs of Berlin map but as I know it’s already in game. 

**HB missions**

**Belated convoy. Britain.** *(Updated 20th April 2013)*

The mission is mostly for low-level planes.

German ship convoy was forced to come near to the coast of England because of the storm. As soon as the weather cleared

The Germans will start in the air


German convoy consists of 18 cargo ships that can be destroyed by machine guns. Cargo ships are covered by destroyers that battered by the storm, and then handle ships with guns. Germans can fully focus on protecting the convoy and shoot down beaufighters before they attack. 

Since the Germans had no opportunity to rearm it’s done that way: shoot down one beaufighter is easer then to sink one cargo ship.
In addition the English have a few light pillboxes


Terms of winning the mission: British must destroy 18 cargo ships

Also Germans will win if convoy reaches the certain point.


**Iwo Jima** *(Updated 27th March 2013)*

The mission is mostly for middle or high-level planes.

USA invades Iwo Jima island.
The Japanese fleet had just been soundly defeated

On their misfortune on Iwo Jima are located somewhat obsolete bombers D3N

The entire coast of the Iwo Jima turned into a fortress with lots of pillboxes and artillery.

There are 3 aims for both parties in the mission

**Mozdok** *(Updated 21th March 2013)*

This mission is mostly for low-level aircrafts and there are no heavy armored ground units and there is a little decrease in the distance between the airfields (30 km instead of 40).


German troops reached the bank of the Terek and going to strike the final blow to lose Soviet troops from their positions. However

This mission is a short sketch of Mozdok-Malgobek defensive operation which happened in autumn 1942.  

Soviet forces are in defense and try to hold back the German infantry


German side has several well-defended fuel depots, plying between German stores. Killing them won’t affect the outcome of the mission and won’t bring you lions or XP but they dying and falling down dramatically.

In addition to the trenches

**Honolulu** *(Updated 4th April 2013)*

The mission is mostly for low-level planes.

Pearl Harbor - is the largest naval base of the United States in the Pacific. Knowing that the main forces of USA are distracted by attack on Midway


The Japanese team has a squadron of Japanese bombers
Japanese players who choose the bomber as their plane can join this squadron

Both sides have 1 aircraft carrier


The battle itself is divided into several sectors:


* Japanese bombers 

* Japanese and U.S. Navy 

* Japanese and American ground units

**Ardennes map update** *(Updated 21th February 2013)*

In the next major patch 1.29 this changes can be expected *(yeah


1. Germany's air defense considered that 37mm FLAKs more needed in the eastern front

2. Unleashing tank unit armed with the Tigers

3. Realizing that the pillboxes within the city are not very efficacious

4. German squadron of He-111 failed to start the engines due to cold and they left somewhere in the distant airfield


5. But the American bombers feel luckier, but very dangerous goal (as formation flying and cover each other with fire of onboard shooters). Accordingly, the Germans issued a mission to destroy American bombers, and the Americans job is to protect them.

6. Fixed bugs in movements of units

7. Airfields. Both sides have got new airfields and even a very drunk pilot can land B-17 safely. Gradually airfields will be replaced on other maps.

8. The Americans have replaced m5 stuart tanks with m4 sherman.

*That's all for now.*



PS: Nobody knows for sure when all of this will come

Also there are a lot of rumors that devs preparing something for the 9th of May (Victory Day) and that there would be HB event - Battle for Berlin

Train your crew (gunner too) to extremely high G-Force.

At spawn drop your bombs immediately.. Start to climb.  By dropping the bombs you climb quite decently.. they will reload by the time you need them.

3.5K is your minimum bombing run start altitude.  

Your dive angle is almost straight down.. 85 degrees or so.

You should be reaching a speed of 700+ during this dive.

Drop your first bomb early so you still have dive time to line up your second target.

After bombs away pull out of the dive and climb at 60-70 degrees.  WEP all the way until engine sputters.  

Your guns are not to take out ground targets

If during the dive you decide to level out (to go after some target) instead of immediately climbing.. well you're most likely dead.  

If you have someone climb to 3K+ to shoot you down, you have dive brakes going after all.  Don't be tempt to pursue and shoot at him, just dump your bombs and start climbing again.  Don't get tempted to shoot at someone.. Climb and get to work for the Führer

1. **AI Airplanes:** This one goes for historical battle also

2. **AAA:** As it is right now AAA isn't visible and the only explanation I can come up with is that it's some sort of bug. You have no idea if AAA is shooting at you so often you'll just be cruising along and suddenly your wing falls off because some invisible flak cannon was shooting at you for the past 5 minutes and you didn't even know it. The only AAA that seems to show up is the AAA at airfields which is horribly overpowered.

3. **Bombers:** This one sort of goes for HB but again, it's always because of enemy losing all their planes. Bombers need a bigger roll because right now their only roll seems to be getting shot down by invisible AAA. 

4. **Weather:** Haha, so why is it in FRB?

So that's about it for the major issues I can think of right now. There's many other smaller issues  but these are the ones that in my opinion are making it unplayable. All of my most fun experiences have been in FRB

It shouldn't shock anyone that the Spitfire throughout the second world war had many design changes made to it. 24 different marks of spitfires were produced, here are the 3 main types used and their aerodynamic properties.

So yesterday, and then hop back in my F4U-1c. I get 6 kills my first round. Must have been a fluke, I thought, so I play another. 4 kills, and I still don't have a scratch. There was mention of .50 cals being ""punchier"" in one of the chats, so I decided to take my P51 out. As normal, I found myself in a game with all Doras, before a few friendlies managed to get over and help me finish off all of them. I ended the round with 4 kills (2 of the doras

Then I decided to get in my P47 and give it a a try. Fortunately for me, I assisted some friendlies in killing a few FW190s that were trying to turn-fight at low altitudes, and then set out for home to reload. At some point, a dora got the drop on me and got quite a few hits on me. Normally the P47 would have bursted into flames after seeing the mere shadow of a dora, but not this time. A friendly was already hauling ass over to assist me, and I managed to delay my death long enough for the friendly to scare him off. With my entire aircraft black and red, I made it back to the airfield and reloaded. I think I ended the game with 1500 points

The first thing i'd like to say is that in AB, 5-1 engagements are inevitable--embrace them.

Second, you don't know the guy behind you from adam; he may not give a shit if he kills you as long as he gets the kill. That means you have to sweep--for his sake and yours. Kick out to the left or right of the target to allow the other members of the swarm a vector to the target that does not include you. I call that a win-win scenario. 

Third, you have no right to bitch about being killed by a member of your own team. You knew what you signed up for---hovering around the target's hindquarters' in a swarm is akin to taking yourself hostage for him. And as we all learned from the Hollywood blockbuster ""Speed,"" the solution in that scenario, is to shoot the hostage. 

Third and finally, and all the members of the swarm bank left, your wings stay at the same level of inclination, and your engine stays at the same level of thrust throughout the entire turn. This makes your plane predictable--and that's the name of the game.  

Fourth, you knew what this was--what you signed up for. When it goes bad--don't cry about the other pilot's skill, the toughness of the target's plane, or your own; by entering the swarm, you have made a conscious choice to take the risks inherent in this dangerous formation. Deal with it. 

Air collisions usually happen when someone does something spontaneous and unpredictable. And while we all prefer not to be part of a target swarm in [AB], if we all follow these simple rules. Good luck out there. ",[Arcade],False,self,t5_2uc6j,False,us,

Q: How is it that I can set someone on fire multiple times and in the same place ?  
A: Its a bug and will be changed in the future  
  
Q: Why is mouse aim more resistant to damage than other kind of control ?  
A: Damage is same but mouse aim is given assists to keep flying (instructor).  
  
Q: Planes are hard to spot between 1000 to 5000 meters distance.  
A: Its being addressed by future development

Q: (I muted the guy due to excessive mic hissing) ? Hispano ? MG-FF ?.  
A: You have to wait for the coming update
  
Q: Ki61 Ic got wrong cannons they used Type 2 HO5 20mm not MG151.  
A: Post your documentation and sources on the forum and if we are wrong we will change it.  
  
Q: Is there any plans to change how Hispano cannons are fired? Like a shotgun effect (recoil and fragmentation).  
A: The recoil is calculated by the physics of the plane
 
Q: Will we be able to use several ammo belts for our planes with multiple MGs of the same caliber ? 
A: We plan to this but not now
 
Q: Is the japanese Type 99 Mark II cannon performing correctly in HB? Are they bit too good or not historically accurate ?.  
A: In comparison with the other cannons they are working correctly. In the upcoming patch their behavioure will be changed as will the other cannons.  
 
Q: Mosquito is missing bombload.  
A: They will be implemented.  
 
Q: A damaged wing behaves like its attached to an anchor.  
A: We will look into it.  
 
Q: Will we see accurate damage done to aircraft instead of generic damage decals.  
A: In time we would like to but its not easy work
  
Q: Will we see a bomb bigger than 4000 lbs.  
A: YES.  
 
Q: 50 Cal seems to need lot of hits to get a kill ?.  
A: Historically they needed lot of hits to get a kill.  
  
Q: Dealing with how damage is calculated are all rounds being applied their correct ballistic coefficients and if so is there a damage curve which reduces damage based on ballistic coefficient in regard to range ? 
A: Yes and next patch be more accurate taking into account air resistance and shape of the shell. The loss of energy is calculated depending on distance and curve
  
Q: Do you plan on adding more shell racks ?  
A: Yes there will be more ammo racks
  
Q: Sometimes I see hit decal being applied to enemy without getting damage message ?.  
A: Its a bug that can happen if you cause non critical damage. Its on the todo list.  
  
Q: Will Japan finally get their first jet aircraft on the upcoming major patch ?  
A: Future development
 
Q: Are you aware of a MM exploit about rank 12s getting into biplane games.  
A: Issue is solved on test server. Fix waiting to be deployed on live server.  
  
Q: Do tracer and ball rounds have different trajectories ingame ?  
A: Yes trajectory is based on muzzle velocity
 
Q: Mouse aim whine no.3214354682
A: When player population allows we plan to add filters so you have the option of just playing with other joystick users.  
 
Q: Ki61 climbs faster than it did in real life.
A: Yes we know about this and it will be fixed.
 
Q: Is there a way to keep game audio playing while alttabbed so I can hear the match loading beep? I spend my FRB queue time browsing /r/Warthunder / WT forum.  
A: We add not the sound but make the task bar icon for WT (aces.exe) flash
  
Q: How are the repair costs calculated especially differences between the game modes as example Fw190A5 cost 17k in HB and 24k in FRB while F8 cost 16k in both HB and FRB.  
A: Its calculated on the statistics on how well the plane does in this example the A5 does much better in FRB then F8.  
  
Q: What is the burnout time of the incendiary / tracer rounds ?  
A: What we have now in game is dependent on bullet lifetime. In general 7.7 mm bullets is effective to about 1, falloff included.  
 
Q: Is there any chance you are going to change vitality/health of pilot and bomber gunners? I am a FRB player and its very hard to get enemy gunner unconscious/down. Its too far away from realistic. Is this ammo issue
A: This will be reworked in the major patch update.  
  
Q: I heard there was a rumor about players manning plane gunner positions in aircrafts.  
A: Translation error
  
Q: Will there be a possibility soon^TM that enables you and a friend to play a same match but on separate team as in versus each other ?  
A: Custom battles sure but not in random battles.  
  
Q: Will radar be implemented for night fighters and how will it be an advantage in say HB as we have icons ?  
A: At night the range of icons is reduced and again in bad weather. Radar will help with this as it don't care about bad weather.  
  
Q: There are some skins requiring kills on Malta to unlock can this be unlocked by playing custom games ?  
A: Cannot be unlocked by playing custom battles.  
  
Q: Ramming question people shoot at you before ramming into you and thus gets a kill award.  
A: We will look at this and improve.  

Q: Bullet dispersion right now it seems like bullet drop is modelled but its laser beam accuracy.  
A: Complex work but we continue to improve on this.  
 
Q: Many of the planes we fly are not suited for bad weather conditions  and in HB/FRB battle we often bad weather. Any plans to change the weather pattern ?  
A: Yes we will look into removing the worst conditions like night combined with rainstorms.  
  
Q: Nvidia owners experience micro freezes  
A: Make a bug report and attach the most recent .clog file to the report so the devs can take a deeper look and hopefully resolve the the issue.  
 
Q: With tank battles coming soon^TM
A: Future development can't talk about that.  
 
Q: Will weather conditions change engine performance
A: We will think about it.  
 
Q: I have crash landed and I'm not getting repaired and rearmed what gives ?  
A: It depends on how damaged the plane is if its badly damaged the crew can't repair it.
  
Q: Are you doing to include Do 335 to the game ?  
A: Most probability yes.  
  
Q: Will there be an option in the hangar to see the number of consecutive days you have logged in and the number of days until next reward ?  
A: Post it to the suggestions at the forum.  
  
Q: Will there be Golden Eagles rewards for tournaments ?  
A: Yes.  
  
Q: In HB are there plans to continue the battle after the planes are shot down and let the ground forces decide the battle ?  
A: Not until player controlled ground forces are introduced.   
  
Q: When can we get a better Match Maker ?  
A:  Soon^TM.  
  
Q: AI gunners in bombers are not shooting at ground targets
A: Right now we focus on making them better at shooting air targets and until ground forces are introduced its not a high priority.  
  
Q: 40 mm and 37 mm Bofors had no shells with proximity fuse and at the moment in game they do could you change it ?  
A: They had proximity fuses but again if we are wrong we will change it.  
  
Q: Will you add adjustable bombsight
A: It is coming
  
Q: Do you have a plan to increase the fuel of Rocket planes ?  
A: Changes will come to arcade Me163 and Ki200 different system of spending fuel. It will be more fun to fly them *in arcade*.  
  
Q: Is there possible to add something like a signal or waypoint marker for squadmates ?  
A: Most probably yes but after clan system is done.  
  
Q: Playing as squadron must be encouraged is it possible to have added silver lions and or xp bonus for playing as squadrons ?  
A: When playing in squadron you already have the benefit of teamwork which is more effective then playing solo so you will have better win rate and credit earnings.  
  
Q: Will you add German guided anti-shipping bombs ?  
A: Probability yes. Maybe not guided but different types of ammunition and bombs.  
  
Q: Will you allow carrier aircraft to fold their wings ?  
A: It is partially in the code base but its not 3d modelled yet
  
Q: Will Ar234 be placed at a lower rank?  
A: Not in the upcoming update.  
  
Q: Many players don't seem to like the black X that is on the tail of german planes could you replace it with Balkenkreuz ?  
A: Not sure about Balkenkreuz but the X sign will be removed from the tail for sure.  
  
Q: When will you implement economy improvements based on players feedback.  
**A: We will have a special economy update probability right before the global update or right after it. This will change the economy to a state between 1.27 and 1.29 so for the majority of people this is good news.**",self,t5_2uc6j,False,news,germany,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1f0xss/all_devs_qa_session_2013524_the_half_assed/

~~I just posted on the War Thunder forums in the Ask the Devs a question. And I was proposed to them that they make the kills go to the player who does the most damage.~~

~~This will prevent your teammates from stealing your kills as you just chased a guy down for 5 minutes

~~So

~~Also tell me what you think about it here as well

**EDIT** So

It appears that the best idea is to increase the reward you get for making an assist on an enemy. This way you aren't always fighting for the kill because you get more points and because it counts towards achievements and looks better on your record/profile. Now it would create more of a challenge to get the kill just for the fact it would appear better on your profile/ help you unlock achievements that WarThunder may have

The reason why the ""give the kill to the player who did the most damage"" won't work (From what I've read below in the comments) is that it would turn the game into a hitpoint system where each plane has X amount of health, you get the kill cause well you need a pilot to fly the plane.

1367365263.0,1dg2pa,[HB] Historical Battles is broken- a rant from the German perspective.,Frederick_the_Great,23,2,57,"Hi there r/WarThunder. I don't have a plan while writing this- just a lot of frustration. Bear with me if this devolves much.


An introduction for you all that will be a key part of understanding my rant: I play Germany as my far-and-away primary air force. I am Level 13 Germany

In that time my enjoyment of the game has steadily decreased

I want to present the problems that I have with HB as of this moment


Problem 1: (Nearly) every time I get into the game the map is Ruhr.

I don't know what causes this; I know for a fact that Ruhr is not the only German HB map. We have 2 maps versus the russians, what gives? I would love to play more games against the Russians or the Brits on their own turf. Is the problem that there is a massive population of German and American players dwarfing all other factions? In any case, I am sick and tired of Ruhr and I think that a more random map rotation could help to reinvigorate HB.

Solution 1: Make maps other than Ruhr appear in the rotation more often


Problem 2: The economy is broken- for all of us.

Really, a level 13 fighter, into service costs over 1000000 lions. Hence, my mindset while going into battle has changed: I'm no longer there to have fun per say- instead, I'm desperate to make lions on the battle. Obviously this is not a suitable mindset to enjoy the game in- and it is a huge contributor to the mobbing of any available target by all nearby German fliers. We all need the money desperately.


Problem 3: The HB missions are monotonous even on different maps


I for one would appreciate more varied and more historical HB options beyond the plethora of tactical air-support missions we have. Someone on this subreddit suggested not that long ago that we have the US/UK vs Germany HBs start with the Germans on the ground and the US/UK at altitudes of at least 5000m. How hard would it be for Gaijin to put in a formation of B17s, of course). Why not have a Blitz HB map where the roles are reversed? It's annoying for the game to be tactical air support to a Bf 109 pilot, and nothing is more ridiculous than climbing to 5000m to see maybe 1 US/UK pilot up that high- the realm where the air war was actually fought!


There are of course a slew of other issues- unfinished flight models

1366443619.0,1cqc68,[Arcade] A few tips I have learned or picked up in my first few months playing.,iranoveryourdog,24,3,41,"I had no prior experience with any game like this in the past. I do have an aviation background and there was still a learning curve for me. After spending a long night playing arcade after arcade tonight and having to give out the same tips in almost every game I am going to try and post them here. I might be way off base as some of these might be common knowledge here.

- Know the aircraft. Know what the one you are flying can and can't do. Know what your target can and cannot do well and exploit it. Your P-39 will not beat that Spitfire you have been trying to turn fight for the last 25 seconds. 

- Please do not be 'that guy' that complains that a 37mm just killed you with one shot. Yes

- Do NOT ignore the enemy bombers. Some people say playing a bomber sucks

- Use and abuse the environment. Are you in a Spitfire with a big slow loud thing tailing you? Lead him into a mountain or ground. Fly into the trees. Since arcade has targeting and name tags you gotta out think your enemy more often than out playing them.

- Being chased by a decent pilot? Try and lead him to your base or into your team. Tunnel vision is real. 

- Don't let yourself be led. Know when to break off. I have shot down a lot of planes who followed me for too long in a slower plane

-  It is helpful to aim for weak spots
Example http://youtu.be/lFKNgfLzRTc?t=4m38s start ats 4:40. */u/WhiteRevan*


- Learn how to ""jig"". It's amazing how effective this is and very few people do it. Basically this is the practice of performing erratic random movements when someone is on your tail. Even if all you do is perform an indefinite aileron roll while shaking your mouse around you will evade so many shots

- Try not to fly at a bomber or most attack planes from a direct 6 o'clock. There is most likely guns back there. They have a big plane you probably do not. They will likely shoot you down.

- Don't trust the lead indicator. I have noticed that a lot of people in arcade aren't actually trying to predict your movements or actually lead you into gun fire. I have played with my yaw while being tailed only to have someone shoot at my planes orientation and not the actual flight path I'm taking. Try a few matches with it off. You will notice an improvement.

- For the love of god don't do the conga with an enemy plane. Rarely have I seen it actually take 6 people to kill one person. What usually happens is you all shoot each other, and it is easy.

- If you can help it

- When you are in a lull between fights always reload. With an aced crew and maxed reload speed it should be no more than 15 seconds to totally rearm. Don't get caught with only a few rounds.

- Constantly be aware of what is going on around you. Arcade is in 3rd person

- Know the enemy team. I am not talking what their planes can do

- For anyone that's actually trying to win legit head-on engagements. Start firing when the opponent is within 1km and approaching, they're most likely almost dead with engine gone and pilot most likely wounded. */u/W4lt3r89*

- Manually controlling the pitch/roll/yaw of the aircraft while trying to get onto a tail in a turn fight

- For anyone that plays on the US server. Stop being such dicks to each other. It is a game. 

Anyone else care to add anything? I only really have exp with USA and German planes up to high tier. So take what I posted with a grain of salt. I am especially not very versed in turn fighting.

 Then the repair counter is still ticking

 Now, if the plane is already being repaired in the first place, I feel that flames should be put out or at the very least not be allowed to make the timer count upward. I think that having a fire extinguisher or a water hose on an airfield would be pretty much required, and for them to repair the plane in the first place, the fire would need to be put out. So if the timer is ticking in the first place, there should be no more flames.

The issue is more of a historical one.

Let's have a look at the American captured [BF109 F-4](http://i.imgur.com/jASWdFL.png)

It has a [MG151](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_151_cannon). Note the 20x82mm cartridge.

Now

It strikes me as odd that a nation would produce ammunition for the few examples of a foreign aircraft they captured. 

Surely

There's less issue with 7.** mm and 12.** mm guns because they were somewhat interchangeable - between Germany/UK/USA at least.

The only real decent plane is the Corsair D

-Besides, to avoid ALL the bullets they shoot, usually they hit just one, and because they have a OHKO cannon, you end up being crippled and your whole agility advantage is nullified.

-Is it just me, even with the combined Tailgun+Dorsal turret Quad browning onslaught to the face, it generally takes 5 or more seconds of sustained fire (assuming all shots are contacting) to actually do any meaningful damage. In 99% of cases, the German finishes me off before my Quad brownings can scratch them (Yes I am contacting, it is not hard to hit a German fighter camping 300M behind your bomber).

My suggested fixes:

-Adjust matchmaker and limit planes based on factual numbers (I.e. little to no Dora presence as there were so few of them made in real life

-Give allies # advantage

-Attacking team (Allies for all current HB maps) starts in the air already relatively close to target and high up,False,self,t5_2uc6j,1369029608.0,HB,,t3_1eogbf
