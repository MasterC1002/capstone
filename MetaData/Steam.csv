&gt;A few days ago

&gt;I looked at your Enhanced Steam extension - it looks great (you really did a good job there). Now let us try do our best

&gt;Let's work together. Let's see what happens.

This this was my reply:

&gt;Sorry I didn't answer your previous email, I have no reason to trust it or you.  Your ""offer"" is deplorable: ""Commercialization is a fact of life"" (as it says on your website) is a terrible and untrue slogan.  You obviously did your research enough to find out that I administer a popular Google Chrome extension, congratulations.  What your research failed to show is that it has now been published as open-source material.  This means that if I were to suddenly stick a bunch of advertising in as you suggest, someone could easily fork the code and release an ""ad-free"" version.    You asking me to add advertising is like asking me to give up something I've worked hard to create.

&gt;Using Enhanced Steam requires a fair bit of trust on the part of my users, and one of my three original goals (as it states on my website) is that ""Enhanced Steam is 100% free to download, install, and use"".  This includes adding advertising.  

&gt;Your views of the world are obsolete.

I wanted to share because I want the community to know that Enhanced Steam will always be free and open.  If you don't already have it installed (and would like to) you can download it for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox at [http://www.EnhancedSteam.com/download.php](http://www.EnhancedSteam.com/download.php)

And a huge ""Thank you"" again to the awesome Steam community for your support!",self,t5_2qwis,False,,blackSteam,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d5m7k/im_the_original_author_of_enhanced_steam_here_is/

1341338282.0,vzm65,Tinfoil-hat Crackpot Theory on the Impending Sale,PSBlake,541,133,307,"This is going to sound crazy. It probably is, my hypothesis is that the date of the upcoming sale is being hinted at in the representative image for each Daily Deal game.

Running through the logic in my head

* Most of the Steam community expected that the Summer Sale would follow the pattern of the previous two Summer Sales - Launching on the last Thursday in June. The sale which went up instead was for [Analogue: A Hate Story](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/209370/capsule_467x181.jpg). A few people focused on the clock
* The next daily deal was [Midnight Mysteries Collection](http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/subs/15239/header_586x192.jpg). I'm having a hard time fitting this one into the theory, there are more than six fireflies or whatever they are - I count at least eight)
* The next daily deal was [Governor of Poker 2: Premium Edition](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/70210/capsule_467x181.jpg). Note the $5 chip in the lower right corner of the image.
* Next came [Zombie Driver](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31410/capsule_467x181.jpg) - Four blades protrude from the front of the vehicle.
* Yesterday's deal was [Space Ark](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/19320/capsule_467x181.jpg) - The rocket has 3 windows.
* Today's deal is [Legendary](http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/16730/header.jpg?t=1270602384)

The pattern (if there is one) forms a countdown, is when major events generally happen on Steam anyway.

Yes, I'm probably wrong. But it still makes a weird, ""throw the dehydrated water canister to kill Orat"" kind of sense.

If the pattern holds, or Lone Survivor. In fact, Lone Survivor would seem more probable to me, since it fits the pattern of a lower-profile, indie-developed game which won't generate a lot of excitement if it goes on sale (Since it was included in the most recent Humble Bundle).

That's it. That's my daily dose of crazy.",self,t5_2qwis,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/vzm65/tinfoilhat_crackpot_theory_on_the_impending_sale/

This also serves a dual-purpose because on the last day during the ""Last Chance"" deals you can just check your wishlist to see what is worth picking up at the end and what is not.

1357147533.0,15u13t,Steam Big Picture - Everything you need to know,IamAnEngineer,237,47,65,"Hi guys

I figure our steam reddit could use a general guide (with more details than the official website) for people to get up and running with big picture quickly - I have accrued some wisdom trying to set up my own but perhaps people could comment in with additional details and I can update the main post.

**What is Steam Big Picture (SBP)**
Essentially with the new update of steam, partially compatible, or not very compatible.

**What you will need**
You will need a way to output video and audio (if required) to your larger monitor. A wireless gamepad is recommended

**Choosing an input device**
Ideally you will want a gamepad of some sort - wireless is the best option. I recommend the microsoft xbox360 controller for PC. It can be had for about ~$40 in the US. Also the logitech F710 is a good pad, so minimal tinkering is required with the settings if you go that route. If you don't want to shell out lots of money for a new gamepad, you can buy a cheap USB bluetooth dongle for PS3 controller (if you have a ps3) and use appropriate drivers from the internets to set it up that way (google ""motioninjoy""). Finally, I find having a wireless keyboard is useful if you want to do web browsing in SBP.

**Connecting SBP to your PC**
There are several routes you can go here. If your PC is in close proximity to the TV, you will be safe with a 28 AWG cable, for anything longer go with 26 or lower. Here is an explanation from monoprice: http://www.monoprice.com/home/home.asp?pn=help&amp;idx=12. Note their standards are a bit exaggerated. Do not drop big $$$ on HDMI cables that tout having gold connectors or buy the ""monster"" brand. This is all B.S. I got a great HDMI cable that is 15 ft for about $15. For us Canadians, I highly recommend shopping at Canada Computers (their iCAN brand is fine). Other options involve using a long DVI cable or VGA, and having sound come from your PC speakers. If your TV is far away from your PC, you can invest in some sort of wireless technology. I don't know much about this subject (perhaps others can comment) but such a technology for example is WiDi (you can google). It allows sending of a 1080p signal wirelessly between compatible devices. Expect to invest some serious $$$ if you end up going this route.

**Latency and Sound Configuration**
One drawback to using SBP is latency found in a lot of TVs. Latency refers to how long it takes between when you press something and when it actually happens on the screen. Samsung TVs are among the best picture quality wise, in my samsung TV, I have an input labelled DVI/HDMI1 which is specifically designed to have a lower latency. If you are buying a new TV, try to read up about latency. Usually the TV is the major bottleneck for latency.

If you connect big picture via HDMI, you can follow this guide to have both your PC speakers and TV output audio at the same time: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/is-it-possible-to-have-speakers-and-hdmi-play-at/4563a5f8-4be4-4463-b312-eff594a9ae49. Note you will have to turn off the PC speakers for things not to get annoying when you play big picture.


I think that covers quite a bit - please feel free to comment with more details and I'll add them. Cheers!

**Useful tips from members:**

* when connecting to a TV, for example, has the ability to underscan. You can also improve 10-ft readability by adjusting DPI settings in windows.
* holding the XBOX button on a 360 controller for 10 seconds will launch Big Picture Mode
* a $20 USB ""xbox wireless controller adapter"" is perfect for this setup
* if using audio over HDMI
* some games will still require you use a launcher
* the MotionJoy driver only works with certain bluetooth adapters. i'd recommend checking that before buying a PS3 controller.
* While HDMI does carry audio, this is done with a S/PDIF cable that is supposed to come with your GPU. The two pronged end goes into your GPU, the other end connects to your audio card or motherboard's onboard audio. I'm not sure how it is done with AMD cards.
* SBP mode works in OSX too. But to use the Xbox controller you might need this driver http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver
* Seems a lot of people tend to recommend to disregard the ""high speed"" designation and go for any old HDMI cable - at least for short (&lt;15 ft) cables. The official HDMI website says that the ""high speed"" standard is named so for a reason
* If you want to grab an xbox controller
* there are a few ways to launch directly into Big Picture mode
1)steam protocol: steam://open/bigpicture
2)command line args: steam.exe -bigpicture (I think -tenfoot works too)
3)steam settings: Settings &gt; Account &gt;click ""Start Steam in Big picture mode""
* If you use a wired xbox controller (i use one of the newer black ones) you don't need to buy any plug in to connect the controller and window automatically installed the drivers for it.
* For a logitech pad being used with non-supported games, direct) back if button bindings and joystick directions are weird in some games (saints row 3, red faction armageddon, and spec ops the line are three games that act in this way)",,False,self,1357232086.0,t3_15u13t

Fast forward a few months, feelsgoodman.  

Anyway, it's not too late to go and pay for them after the fact.  It's only fair for the developer to get the money (especially if they are small), and often times you'll find that a $60 game you played when it first came out might only be $10 to buy now.  Even though you're getting it for 1/6 the price you would have paid up front, it's still better to pay the $10 then nothing at all.

It installed fine and so i loaded uPlay. No game tied to my account. Thats odd i thought.... I manually browsed to the Farcry installation folder and ran the exe manually

Ran the game... and now it needs patching. Well i downloaded the full game just now

Ran the patch

Clicked play.... and now another patch-which also crashed.

With nearly 300 upvotes, I decided to make a tutorial on how to download game banners for (all) steam games",megageektutorials,175,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1a8z9z/i_posted_a_link_yesterday_about_the_steam_grid/, is so I could make a [launcher] (http://i.imgur.com/bPmJX1j.jpg) with [rainmeter] (http://rainmeter.net/cms/) but that's for another tutorial.

Downloading the steam banners is actually super easy.

1. Go to the store page for the game you want. I'm going to use [Portal 2] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/?snr=1_7_15__13).

2. As you can see in the URL bar, Portal 2 is app ""620"". You will need this number for every game you want to download the banner for.

3. Next

  |http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/620/header.jpg

 |Notice the 620.

4. It will now show a picture (hopefully from the game you wanted).

5. Right click the picture and click ""Save-As"" and download the picture.



If you want to change (or add) a banner to a steam game

I found a cool pack of banners for a ton of games [here](http://mustkunstn1k.deviantart.com/art/Official-Steam-Grid-Image-Collection-319862312) It has some pretty sick banners.

This instantly makes doing anything within steam miles faster than how it acted before you made the change.

This guide is not a detailed examination of the Steam platform. I'm sure there's plenty of that out there. If there isn't, new enviornment and get the most out of it.

The most important thing to remember about Steam is that its actually three different things put together. It's a virtual software merchant/DRM handler

So

* Look up a game you know on the market

* Search by genre. Right up on the top of the store page there's a list of genres. Starting from that

* If you absolutely must ask the world

Speaking of search (I did mention search somewhere right? ...Yep

Now

Just above that in the blue box is the daily deal. It'll show a new game every 24 hours and generally resets at noon Central Standard Time. What does that mean for your time? I dunno, and the weekend deals which runs from Friday noon until Monday noon (CST). Small note- Daily deal is usually one game, midweek madness is normally one game or one game franchise, and the weekend deals are normally several games.

Last thing on sales: check out [Steam Game Sales](http://www.steamgamesales.com/). They give a rather thorough list of sales not just on Steam

Okay so now you know all about how to find games and get the best deals. But can you even play these games? Well

**Note for Apple Users**: You don't have a whole lot of games to choose from. On the store's main page

**Note for Linux Users** They're working on it. Chill.

**Note for Windows 7 Users**: Old games don't always play well on new systems. If a game was made before around 2006

This next part could probably be called Steam: The good the bad and the ugly. That's super overused though, Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012. That purchase is tied to your Steam account. First, that means that you've bought it forever. The license is yours until the end of Steam. Second that means that **no matter what computer you're on, as long as it has Steam you can use it to play your game**. Of course it helps if the game is already downloaded. If the game uses the Steam Cloud feature, it means it also saves a copy of your game files online, so even those will go with you.

There are problems with this, you can still run Steam in offline mode. However, some of your games either won't play at all, or will give you a lot of trouble. This isn't entirely Steam's fault. a lot of the issues come from [3rd party DRM](http://steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List). That list will show you most of the games on Steam that have some sort of DRM, and how to deal with it. If you aren't sure what DRM is, [read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management).

There is another, its too ugly to use regularly. There is also a grid view, but it just looks cluttered.

You can also add your non-Steam games (and every other piece of software on your computer

Finally, which can be useful for finding out more information about the game, setting up groups for multiplayer, etc. I've found though that most of the user groups don't do you a whole lot of good, especially when they come from random people inviting you. It doesn't hurt you in any way to join a group though, so feel free to shop around! By the way, [here's the primary reddit group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/reddit).

The more important thing about the community is the involvement with game development, and hats were developed by members of the community. Portal 2 has a community-based testing thing that lets you run chambers made by other people. DotA 2 isn't even released yet and people are making custom stuff for it. Valve believes in the power of community creativity, and uses that to help improve their games. Their philosophy is shared by other developers, and support for that sort of thing is slowly being added for non-valve games, such as Skyrim.

As with any other kind of online interaction, scammers, griefers, and all that other fun stuff. Don't accept game invites or gifts from people you don't know unless you can verify that its legit. Trust your good sense to identify potential elicit behavior, and immediately remove yourself from it. Steam uses something called the VAC (Valve Anti-cheat) system. [Details here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869#notvac). Basically, its an automated system for detecting and removing cheaters. If VAC bans you, it'll ban you across all VAC-secured servers. This doesn't mean you can't play online any more. First, or a mix of both. Second

Okay

First of all I just want to say how much we appreciate the feedback we got from our last little pow-wow . As you can see we have taken some of the feedback and have begun to implement some new features (the current deals in the banner). We know that they have been sort of lax on updating but we are gonna get on our shit

Alright, please check to see if there are already posts about what you are going to ask. There do not need to be 5 posts about whether or not you should get this game. On that note, NO BEGGING FOR GAMES BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO MONEY. I know that might sound cruel but honestly I am sick of seeing them. This is not the subreddit for that type of thing.

Other Notes:

* We have added /r/SummerHunt to the sidebar to help those with the Summer Sale 
* We also have added [FAQ about Steams Big Sales](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5/faqs_about_steams_big_sales/) (credit to [bryanhbell](http://www.reddit.com/user/bryanhbell)) to the sidebar. 
* WE ALMOST HAVE 15k SUBS!!!!

We are gonna be working on the Steam user names in flair soon so stay tuned. Also if you have all have any suggestions for how we can improve things here like more flair (suggestions would be helpful), we would love to hear them.

Thanks all

The background is a map, they will be revealed to have trading cards before or at the time of their sale. I expect the map will update, showing us where we are going to next and revealing the next days daily deal before it is live.

We are going on a summer getaway, collecting cards, getting a postcard. Starting with bioshock infinite.

So the following games will be dailydeals



    Dead Island: Riptide

    Kerbal Space Program

    Tomb Raider

    Chivalry: Medieval Warfare

    Football Manager Series

    Reus

    Torchlight

I did [another giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/) a couple of months ago and this one will be in the pretty much the same format.


Here's how it works. Should be simple enough:


1. Everyone who wants a game


2. I'll get back on this thread some hours later


3. Once the list is ready


4. I'll also put up the list of winners so you guys can verify that I have the right ones.


5. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/c46p2x8) is the list of movies I came up with last time. These movies are **not** going to be in the list this time around!


Good luck


**A couple of clarifications:**


1. If two people have the same movie


2. If I have only, that person will get the chance to change their game to something fitting the budget.


3. As an example

1341780408.0,w8hae,Advice For Posting About The Steam Sale,bryanhbell,142,30,16,"Over at /r/Games

The basic idea behind the guidelines is to cut down on the volume of duplicate

1. **Please don't beg for games**: this includes (but is not limited to) ""That game isn't available in my region, ""I get paid tomorrow but it's on sale today, can someone spot me?"", etc. Better to post these kinds of things at /r/RandomActsOfGaming or /r/GiftofGames instead.

2. **Please don't post trade threads**: this guideline is already clearly laid out in the sidebar

3. **Please don't post giveaways**: normally, people get generous and we start to see way too many of them. During the big sales, it's best to post these kinds of things at /r/RandomActsOfGaming instead.

4. **Please try to keep discussions relating to the Steam sales to a single thread per day**: this includes (but is not limited to) ""Is this game worth picking up"", check to see if there's already a similar post first. If someone posts something here like [this](//www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nray9), you might want to add a comment there instead of creating a whole new post.

5. **Please read the [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) before posting a question about the sale**: I made this FAQ to help out redditors who are new to Steam's big sales. The mods here have graciously agreed to include a link to it on the sidebar. If you have questions about the sale that you don't see in the FAQ, and after the sale.

As some may know, the developers of this Multiplayer-mod has regularly held weekend-tests (And a single full-week test).  

This weekend

If you already own Just Cause 2
Your Steam-account will be used to gain access to this mod.

Be a gentleman, now that the focus is all around the summersale, and more people are utilizing Steam than usual!  

EDIT:  
Allow me to also mention that Just Cause 2 is a great game by itself, and a couple of individual developers at the studio.  

EDIT2:  

Just to expand a bit

Multiplayer for JC2 is open world free for all.
Keep in mind, or if something is bugged. Instead, report it properly.  

These weekend-tests are held so that the developers can find any issues, they will release the server-files. The server-files for this mod should release later this year, according to the developers.

Right now

- Normal FFA in the open world.  
- Teleport to specific areas in the world. (Hotspots such as the airport)  
- Join or create factions. Factions can have passwords
- Join the Destruction Derby dome - this is in a different instance
- Join races. These are also in an instance secluded from the open world.  
- Purchase new player-models, and completing races. (Only player-models save upon death/reconnect)  
- Chat with people. There's both a global and a local chat. The global chat can be disabled.

If you're into this sort of game you should check out this free program.
 
http://en.spaceengine.org/

This Russian programmer created the observable universe as a free 3D space simulation and made it available online.

It let's you fly around the universe basically. I would kill if Mass Effect or something used this for a basis of a game.

**Edit:** Excerpt on the Program/Capabilities:

* All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, planets and moons, comets and asteroids.
* The observer is free to move around the universe. Transition between any celestial body and any scale occurs seamlessly.
* Known celestial objects are represented using data from the catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), nebulae, planets (our Solar system data and known extrasolar planets).
* Uncharted regions of space feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, nebulae and planetary systems.
* The observer can move around in space using the WASD keys
* ""Select and fly"" autopilot: just click on any object with the mouse and hit the 'G' key to automatically go directly to the object.
* Automatic binding of the observer to the moving object and automatic selection of optimum flight speed.
* Search for celestial objects by name. Search for stars in certain radius. Scalable map of the Universe and a planetary system browser. Saving locations and autopilot's journal.
* Built-in Wiki system with descriptions of many known objects and ability to extend by user. Possibility of renaming and describing of any object
* The orbital motion of planets and stars is calculated in real time, or reverse the flow of time.
* Showing of orbital paths of celestial objects, celestial grid, current selection pointer and user velocity vector.
* Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds.
* 3D landscapes of planets and stars: for many solar system bodies actual data from space probes is used
* The exact model of the Earth's atmosphere (code by Eric Bruneton)
* Lighting effects: lens flares
* Controllable space ships (alpha).
* Localization of many languages with the ability to add new ones.
* Ability to import users addons: models

It can no longer be updated

Secondly this version offers very little you can't have with the original Baldur's Gate game and some mods. The core experience is arguably even better with the modded original version. In fact if you grab both Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2 from www.gog.com and get the BGT mod you probably have the best Baldurs Gate experience possible right now. They are not on sale over on gog atm

Because of legal struggles the version can no longer be updated and the dev gets no more money.
