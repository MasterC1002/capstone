For all you redditors that are coming in from the front page;

Greg ""IdrA"" Fields is a long time pro-gamer. He's a very polarizing figure in the Starcraft 2 community

State of the Game is a weekly talk show with members of the Starcraft 2 community. One of IdrA's now former-teammate (and long-time friend) Geoff ""InControl"" Robinson was a guest on the show and announced the news live.

While many people may have been thinking that some disiplinary action would come from this

This is an incredibly heated topic, personal experience using the (incredibly) limited amount of knowledge I've accumulated while existing in this part of the internet over the past couple of years.

**History**

For a little bit of backstory, considered THE definitive E-Sport. Over [100,000 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starleague_(Ongamenet)#History_of_Starleague) were attending OSL finals.

There's really not much to argue about here. Starcraft: Brood War was enormous. Brood War was an undeniable stepping stone in order to get to where we are today. **So why does it feel like growth has stagnated in Starcraft 2?** Surely there's only one direction to go from the end of the Brood War to the start of Wings of Liberty

**Stagnation and South Korea**

People expected Starcraft 2 to only build upon Brood War and explode in popularity over the 2010-2012 seasons. ""E-SPORTS E-SPORTS E-SPORTS"" people would chant on the forums. Leagues such as IPL

But that growth never came.

Even Sundance went on Live on 3 to explain that he's still [""not making money""](http://www.twitch.tv/onemoregametv/b/308703349?t=55m19s) and that the amount of money being spent now was more akin to ""investing"" than anything that was turning a real profit. We haven't seen the explosion in prize money we've been hoping for.

IPL's prize pool has [remained the same](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/IGN_ProLeague#Tournaments) from seasons 3-5. The NASL's prize pool has [remained the same](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/North_American_Star_League#Tournaments) since its inception. MLG's prize pools [have been rising](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/MLG#Tournaments)

So we haven't really seen the explosive growth that we were kind of expecting and hoping for. There are no million dollar Starcraft 2 tournaments. And

A [quick glance](http://www.gametrics.com/rank/Rank02.aspx) shows that almost 25% of all South Koreans are playing League of Legends in PC Bangs. It's by far the most popular game, and Wings of Liberty doesn't even make the top 10 list.

**Heart of the ~~Swarm~~ Bored**

There's been a lot of hype concerning Heart of the Swarm. Streamers were looking forward to the (hopefully tremendous) boost of popularity due to having access to the Beta. Players were hoping for innovative new mechanics and play, that most of the HotS excitement died off **in about one week**. There was a noticeable bump in viewers for a little while, but everything has pretty much settled down now and people are back to Wings of Liberty.

To me, it changed **everything** and it remained popular for some 10 years, arguably defining a generation of South Korean athletics.

--------

Alright

**How do we grow Starcraft 2?**

**You** can't.

This sounds like a dick answer, but the impact is incredibly minimal compared to the most important factors - SALES. Companies don't sponsor events so that their PR people can jerk off over e-mails all day long; they sponsor events to get a monetary return on their advertisements.

Here's a simple formula.

I invest $x into an event knowing that it gets y viewers. I expect z% conversion on those viewers and my average sale is $a.

The money you invest into a team is the sponsorships that we hear about. The viewers are the number of people that watch tournaments. The ""conversion"" is a % of people that will make a purchase based on the investment in advertising

If MLG gets 150,500 in sales from ""sponsoring"" said tournament. If I were going to advertise or invest in MLG, there are no amount of ""friendly e-mails"" that are going to cause me to invest more than that into it, because it's simply not worth my time or money to do so.

Yeah, I get this feeling/notion that people think that if we just go on these mass e-mailing sprees that somehow it will ""grow e-sportz!!111"" or cause this huge influx of money into the scene.

In the end

**If we can't do anything

There is only one person right now who can grow Starcraft 2 in the way it needs to grow. One entity

Blizzard.

Starcraft 2 is suffering from a lot of problems. It has been from the very beginning

People, no one wants to play that game except competitive people.

Competitive games are not fun.

It's not fun to play ranked matches that affect a ladder ranking. Why on earth would you play a game that gives you ladder anxiety? Why would you play a game where 11/11 or 6 pools or 4gates can kill you in under 4 minutes? Why would you play a game that punishes mistakes so cruelly?

The average

Let's look at Brood War for a second. Check out [what you see](http://i.imgur.com/KyINg.png) as soon as you log in. The chat + friends list takes up almost 70% of the screen! If you want to play ""Melee"" games (kind of the equivalent to Laddering in SC2) you have to click the ""Join"" button on the right

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to things like these; obviously the people in Blizzard who work in the positions they work in are there for a reason

WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THE FOCAL POINT OF SC2 A COMPETITIVE ASPECT WHEN 95% OF CASUAL GAMERS HAVE NO DESIRE TO COMPETE?!

This lack of understanding on Blizzards part is the number 1 reason why Starcraft 2 is dying

Here are a few suggestions just right off the top of my head

- More ways to get achievements (everyone fucking loves achievements, Steam, PSN, origin, WoW, to name a few)
- Customizable decals or skins for units (no affect on play
- Paid/unpaid name change (THEY ALREADY ACCEPT PAYMENTS AND YOU CAN ALREADY CHANGE YOUR NAME
- Fix the clusterfuck that is ""The Arcade"" (I don't even)

Blizzard is by no means an indie company

Players LOVE ""building"" towards something when they play. That's why people grind out games on League of Legends - they always earn points every game that they can put towards new champions or runes.  **There is no reason to play more than a few online games of Starcraft 2 before putting it down and being done with it.** This is a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM.

What's worse, BUT FIX THE CLUSTERFUCK ARCADE, casual gamers don't give a fuck about 1v1s!

**So what's going to happen in the next few years?**

I'm sorry if I come off as pessimistic, DotA 2 is...well, fuck, it's DotA and Valve, what else needs to be said? Both games push their marketing HARD (RioT [pushes their youtube](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/news/subscribe-riot-games-youtube-get-unchained-alistar) and runs [all sorts of promotions](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=80451) to get people involed in the community, DotA has [HATS](http://kotaku.com/5914769/dota-2-is-free-but-you-can-buy-hats) MAN, HATS!).

Starcraft 2 has....people clapping during Blizzcon when players don't spawn in close positions and people screaming in agony when lag screens come up. And don't give me this bullshit about how ""IT WASN'T B.NETS FAULT!""

Again, the only person we can really rely on to step up their game is Blizzard. The community can help, a bit; purchasing products and letting advertisers know you are making purchases based on sponsorships + telling your friends about the game. But Blizzard HAS to make some kind of serious attempt to appeal to the casual player and to bolster interest and support from the casual gamer.

The ball's in your court

So today after waking up to some of the following scenery

This is what it looks like: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0448.png

The Room:
http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0449.jpg
http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0450.jpg

I've been smoking cigarettes for about 6 years now. Im up to about a pack a day, that costs a lot of money and makes a lot of situations more stressfull, rather than relieving stress which is what people originally use it for.

Other than smoking

Before: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/ret1stprizedhs09.jpg
After: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/ret_interview2.jpg

I have succeeded before living healthy for a long period of time and managed to lose about 120 lbs in the course of 8 months. After picking up SC2 again though

Today will be the last day I will smoke a cigarette, or what kind of side effects I should expect. I thought a fun way to keep myself distracted from whatever may happen - is just to play a shit ton of starcraft. I have 2 big tournaments coming up in November, MLG Dallas and LoneStarClash, and if I just do nothing but play Starcraft 2 for 8 days while beating a bad habit, I think nothing but good could come out of this for me. 

Other than obvious downsides of smoking, and addiction, it also makes your heartrate increase and has a bad influence on your brain. I don't think this is good for a starcraft progamer. I want to try and compete and be as healthy and fit as possible from this point on - we are cyber 'atlethes' after all.

Tonight I will clean out my room, but think about it, and live a little healthier, nothing bad can come of it!

First thing I'll do tomorrow is go to the gym and then I'll stream for 10 hours - everyday untill I go to MLG Dallas to compete, make fun of me, whatever!

But I know now that I've told EVERYBODY about this

My personal goals:

- Becoming a non smoking person over the course of 1 day...2 days... 1 week.. 1 month..forever.
- Living a healthy lifestyle that attributes to becoming a better progamer overall. Fitness
- Being happier. (Of course!)

Short term Goal:

- During this 8 day heavy stream stint before MLG Dallas, obtain rank 1 EU GM!! :D (This is just for fun, and to motivate myself haha)
- You can expect from me to stream 10 hours for the next 8 days each day

No matter what happens I will update on twitter - wether it's sleeping problems, but hopefully after a little while I can start tweeting about how much nicer it is to breathe, and all that good stuff.

As a Follow up of all this I will post a VLOG at some point during or right atfter MLG Dallas

hope you guys enjoy the show tomorrow, that want to make a change in their life to pick up the axe and start axing away in the following days, and we can start living healthier (This bunch of emo crap should appeal to the American Spirit around here - note ret.)

Tomorrow people will laugh at me for this but in the end I hope to see the benefits and I just wanted to make it fun. And If I can get one other person to quit too then this would be a great succes also :)

As I post this the whole room is clean and all the traces of ashes or cigarettes are 99% gone - it was too dark to do it 100%. And tomorrow we start this battle with sc2 as the remedy :D

1334266907.0,s6uxo,"Hi Reddit, This is HD, &amp; I should have wrote this a long time ago.",AlexHDGamer,5871,1180, and I was one of the broadcasters during IPL4 at the Cosmopolitan last weekend. I am here on Reddit to make a post that I really should have done a long time ago. Reddit is a community that is very outspoken with their thoughts, and that


Now, and I've finally had a chance to process the entire event and the feedback. First, let me say that the reason why I haven't responded or made a public post on Reddit before is because quite honestly I was/am? scared. I am human, and last weekend was definitely an emotional roller-coaster. You guys tore me a new one. I was hurt, still am, but I need to address the community. Although I'm not entirely sure how this post is going to come across to you guys, I've decided I'm just going to let it all out


First off let me say that I agree with most of you guys, make ammends with the community, and hopefully look forward to a brighter future. You guys are right in saying that I need to improve my casting, whether it be improving my knowledge of the metagame, the players, my choice of words, etc. I'm also here because there is a stigma associated with me, I'm at least hoping that it can shed some light on me as a person


If there has been any doubt about me not reading posts made about me on Reddit, some of the things that were said (I think I read somebody would like to punch me in the face if they saw me? Good thing that didn't happen O.o), but I tried to take all of the constructive posts and comments as best as I could, and improve the way I casted on Sunday in order to give the community what they wanted. I took great care to slow down my commentary, because I feel like I blurt out mistakes when I get excited, and I made sure to be as genuine as possible, rather than incorporating ""excitement"" that might come out as fake. Althought it still may not have pleased everyone, there were still silly mistakes made in the heat of the games, and it was because of the community. Its also no secret that my fundamentals of Zerg are much stronger than Protoss or Terran, before it was too late. 


Obviously, and never heard from again. But for those who have been there to support me and give me constructive criticism, I want to give my thanks. It can be very difficult attempting to cast and please both the casual and hardcore StarCraft audience, and this is where I have to find a balance that makes sense.  It is my hope that in the future, should I return to IPL, that the community will see I am working hard to improve my casting, and I continue to humbly submit myself to the community and its comments and critiques. Afterall, and you guys have the final say. Constructive critique helps me improve


PS. I would like to take this opportunity to clear the air regarding somebody who was impersonating me on Reddit last year. (That was not me.) I hope nobody took offense to what was said under my supposed alias

Edit: Also would like to take this opportunity to ask Reddit to keep an eye on my upcoming YouTube casts. That's where I can continue to improve with your critique,False,self,t5_2qpp6,True,,microphone,t3_s6uxo

Let's look at them race-by-race.

TERRAN:

To understand why the first new Terran unit is a bad idea, but bio units can not. Introducing the medic, a new bio unit that can heal marines, firebats and even SCVs not only makes Terran bio simply too powerful, but it removes the important uniqueness of the various races. In essence, it stops Terran being Terran.

The valkyrie is expensive and

Special mention should also be given to the ""Charon Boosters"" upgrade for goliaths. By making it easier to a-move goliaths into guardians or carriers, positional play and strategy.

ZERG:

The zerg army is all about manoeuvrability and strength in numbers. So why the hell are they getting a big, lame copy of a siege tank? Lurkers are not zerg-like at all and have no place in the game.

Devourers, where previously players would have had to build (and lose) scourge to take care of those threats.

PROTOSS:

Dark Templar were fun in the single-player game, so they already have detection everywhere, Terran can take out DTs with a single scan, and Protoss has cannons and observers. I don't see DTs being used in any kind of serious game.

Dark Archon. Does Protoss really need another spell-caster? Some of its abilities seem useful (Mind Control could be potentially game-breaking as it allows you to exceed the supply cap (!))

Corsairs: oh great. Protoss gets _another_ useless air unit to go alongside the Scout. Yawn.

Right now it is uniquely more in fashion this week to do your best chicken little impression in regards to SC2. This is because the mammoth of a tourney in TI3 is going on and it is one of if not the single most watched eSport event we have to offer. It's awesome! Amazing production

During this week (in particular) SC2 gets picked on. SC2 WAS the gaming stud in 2010. All other games envied us. Since then things have changed and we are now no longer the top dog and that is ok. That being said

When MLG ""announced"" that they probably won't have SC2 at their last big MLG event of the season they were doing a couple things as far as I can tell:

A. they were announcing bad news (as far as the SC2 community is concerned) months in advance so the story runs it's course and dies down before MLG rolls around.

B. They were announcing it amidst TI3 because this news cannot steal the headlines and will be to a certain extent muffled by this weeks events.

C. It is MOST ok to ""abandon"" or ""quit"" on SC2 this week because people are at a mindset where they are more likely to accept it as a natural course of action with SC2 ""dying""

This is disappointing but also expected. MLG pays Blizzard to run SC2 at their events. They are PAID BY Riot

I for one am thankful for what MLG has done for SC2 in the past. They ran amazing events and they were a hell of a lot of fun to attend

Is SC2 dying? Is the NA scene dead? Is the game.. declining?

Real talk? No. Do we have problems? Yes. I am going to take a risk and voice an honest opinion that can get me in a lot of trouble:

WCS was initiated sloppy. It was a great idea execute horrifically and it cost us time, the job market in SC2 and really any kind of natural growth. By empowering 3 different partners (4 if you count Kespa/Gom) to the extent you do with WCS you are making it illogical to get involved with SC2. WCS needs to have confidence in it's product but also allow for other people to come in and try their hand. Maybe shorter/fewer WCS seasons would be nice. More down time between seasons. Openly and actively work with the community to encourage non WCS content. We are not Riot, you do not have full control over this scene and that is your STRENGTH blizzard. Trying to seize control now is hurting the ecosystem.

So yes

Moving forward the SC2 scene will be ok! We will never be #1 again but that too is ok. I am happy with being top 5

This game, innovate and generate! 

SO SAY WE ALL

And here we are folks. The beginning of SHOUTcraft America is upon us. A couple of years ago we started a little invitational series that rapidly became one of the most watched online tournaments around. After a long break

**Stream** - http://twitch.tv/totalbiscuit

**Website** - http://www.shoutcraft.com

**Liquipedia article** - http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/The_SHOUTcraft_Invitational/SHOUTcraft_America

**Time** - 2pm EDT/11am PDT/7pm BST/8pm CEST/9pm EEST

**Casters** - TotalBiscuit and Huskystarcraft + regional foreign language streams.


------------------
Group A matches - GSL-style dual tournament format.

* puCK vs Vibe
* Maker vs Minigun
* Winners Match
* Losers Match
* Losers Finals

2 advance

---------

**10 reasons why should you watch it**

1) Support foreign players and help close the gap with Korea

2) Support sponsors shown on the Virtual Jersey and help the scene grow stronger

3) Enjoy face-to-face pre-match banter with the players as they face off prior to their series.

4) Gameheart custom maps for a superior viewing experience

5) Evenly matched and unpredictable play from American pros looking to impress

6) The best intermission music with classic originals and remixes from all your childhood videogame favorites. It's ok

7) No caster cams! Seriously

8) The only tournament where you can encourage and reward great plays by throwing money at them. No coins please

9) 720p 60 frames per second free stream. It might even work for more than an hour if Time Warner Cable doesn't fuck it up. Oh who am I kidding... you might have to watch the free VoDs.

10) Husky and TotalBiscuit are pretty decent casters I guess. I mean hell

A while back, I noticed a thread on reddit trying to organize a mass donation drive to coincide with the special.  I was deeply flattered to see people actually offering to send money my way.  

Sadly, I promised myself that it WOULD happen eventually: I spoke to a videographer and an editor to ensure that the episode would have fancy production values and really give people a sense of my day to day existence :D.

As I organized everything for that episode, and traveled to tournaments every weekend, I didn't have much time to do much else.  In particular, I didn't check my paypal donation page very frequently.  As much as I love the image of me F5-ing paypal every 15 minutes while fist pumping and screaming ""SHIP THE MONEY BITCHES,"" I actually derive my happpiness from doing the show, the warm community, and hearing people say things like ""you helped me get into diamond!""  I'm always blown away by how insanely nice and supportive the SC2 community is.

However

Before my eyes were thousands of dollars.  THOUSANDS.  And not thousands of dollars donated by a handful of generous individuals.  The donations were in small increments: 1$, and a couple of 15s and 20s.  In other words, an astounding amount of people voluntarily donated enough money so that I don't have to take out another gigantic loan for my last semester of grad school.

I was so happy I didn't even know what to do.  Student loans have always been a point of stress for me, teamliquid, and other communities provide donations.  But, I know that the reddit community orchestrated the entire drive, and that it would have never happened without you guys.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.

I'm more motivated than ever to keep making as much content as I can.  I'm even expanding the daily so that I can do more than 5 a week! (doing 2 on tuesdays and wednesdays hopefully!).  As expected

At the end of the day, because the Day[9] Daily is YOUR show.  I might use my face and voice, but the daily has been and always will be about YOU.  Thank you thank you thank you thank you for being so awesome and supportive.  I can't express my gratitude enough :&gt;.

1368746462.0,1ehep0,The Rise of IMBAbuilds. The Fall of GosuBuilds.,NoseKnowsAll,1786,428,202,"Hey all.

You might recognize me as the main contributor of GosuBuilds.  You might recognize me as one of the moderators on /r/AllThingsTerran.  You might recognize me as one of the casters of the ATP/ATT and ATT/ATZ subreddit battles.  You might recognize me as the captain of Rice University's CSL team.

Or you might have no idea who the hell I am and really not give a shit about what I'm writing about.  Regardless

In the summer of 2012, and I was definitely willing to help make that a reality.  I emailed the singular guy who owned it and soon started writing build orders for the site.

However, in the time he wrote up 1), and sometimes not being able to contact him for over a month when it comes to basic changes I would like to see to the website, I decided things needed to change.  I asked to buy the site from him.

Surprisingly, and not about helping the community at all--the main reason that I started working on the site to begin with.  He wouldn't settle for anything less than $1000 (money which to a college kid like me is simply impossible to come by - as well as unreasonable to ask for seeing as the builds I wrote up are the only reason the website went from 200 viewers/day to 5000 viewers/day).  Fully aware that nobody would update the website with new builds if I left (he has told me he stopped playing this game and is only keeping it active for the ad revenue), I left the website.

--------------------

**I would now like to introduce the new Starcraft build order site that I'm working on made FOR the community.  Please check out [IMBAbuilds.com](http://imbabuilds.com/).**

It has most of the builds I wrote for the previous website

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to message me below or email me at imbabuilds@gmail.com if you don't want others to see your questions.  Any UI concerns on the website would be great too - a lot of the website design has changed in the past couple of days

Thank you for reading this long essay.  I thought it would be a bit more brief when I first set out to write it

--------------------

**TL;DR** I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds.  Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

PS: In case any of you are Zerg masters+ players who want to write up builds

Thanks

My name is david, I had to pay for my competitor pass myself ($70). Spectators cost ($20). What benefits do you get from getting a competitor pass, rather than the spectator pass? You basically get everything a spectator gets, but you just get to compete. That's a 50 dollar difference, just so you can compete. 

The problem?
The MLG ""staff"" or ""refs"" are completely bias. Unfortunately for me, and then the MLG staff tells you to leave, if you're spectating in the competitor section. 

Since i'm not on a pro team, no problem.. but why the fuck am I the only one being asked to leave? The korean pro gamers that were eliminated, weren't being asked to leave.The notable American players weren't being asked to leave. Some ""semi-pro"" players that weren't very known were asked to leave too.. 

After leaving, word for fucking word I kid you not: ""Why aren't you asking them to leave? It seems like you're only harassing me to leave. Why do they get to stay?""

MLG STAFF: ""I'll tell them to leave too""

Me: ""Can you tell them first

MLG STAFF: ""No

Me: ""You sure now?""

MLG STAFF: ""yep""

So i left once again

I payed as just as much money as those pro gamers(&amp;their sponsors) did

ALSO

I was playing a practice game before the open bracket started for day 2. The idiot staff told me I had to get off! I looked around me

Why am I reporting here
Well
1. I felt like the community should know this
2. I hope MLG gets bright red with embarrassment and fix this issue.

I don't plan on playing at another MLG ever again (unless a team pays for me^_^) waste of money. 

TLDR; MLG staff are stupid. They should fix it.

Let me start this by giving you the backstory of how I got to where I am

**The Bright Beginning**

Back in 2009-2010, so it wasn’t the competitive scene we were excited for, it was simply the game. I watched a few battle reports, watched some HD and Husky vids on youtube and found the site teamliquid on the way. But that was it, before the game came out, my knowledge of the competitive scene was little to none. I had heard that Brood War was big in some asian country, but i never thought to look into it because I didn’t play the game anymore; what would be the point? 

So what were we excited for? It’s really simple: the Single-player, why would we assume this game wouldn’t? 

Upon release, it’s plot-holes and twists, it’s character development and it’s gameplay. But that wouldn’t satisfy us forever. In fact for me, I could only bring myself to play it once. I never bothered with with any harder difficulties because that’s not what I wanted from the game. I wanted to play something more interactive and involving, something that could be shared instantly with my friends. I wanted this because it’s what being a gamer (for me) is all about. Yes, single Player campaigns are great (my favourite game is Half-Life 2) but I wanted to to play this game with my friends. Plain and simple. So we sought other means of entertainment. Enter: custom games and team melee. I’m not going to give my experience of the custom games system yet, but I will come back to this later.

We played custom games for a while and we were genuinely having fun. Then one day, FruitDealer was incredible and the doors to this whole other world swung open so violently that it took awhile for my eyes to adjust. I couldn't get enough. And for a good while there, neither could my friends. I was more passionate about starcraft than I think about anything else. When Jinro was in the Ro4 in GSL, I joined a rally for Julian Assange, holding a Sign that on one side said “Ignorance is Strength” While the other said “[Go Jinro](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=175764)”

Here’s where my story takes a turn. a turn that results in me being alone out of my group of 5-6 friends who still watches any starcraft at all. 

**The Fade**

Why did my friends all stop watching it? For the longest time I couldn’t understand. Watching tournaments and streams was, it was better. Why weren’t my friends sharing the passion I had? After talking to them, I now know the truth, and it’s really simple. They didn’t care about the game anymore. When we got bored of playing the same custom games over and over, they lost interest. (I will also add that a big part of why some stopped is because we are Australians, and since it’s release, we are still playing all of our games on american servers. Even when you choose to log into SEA, whether it be ladder or customs

So that brings me to now. I still watch all GSL code S games. I Follow my favourite teams in the various leagues and I am still waiting for IdrA’s glorious comeback. But this past week has been frustrating to me because almost all of the pro’s and community figures don’t seem to understand me. 

Today on Inside the Game

**The Present Dark**

I watch the show almost every week and find myself in agreement with the hosts on almost everything. But today was different. Today, in their position, cannot know what we want. djWHEAT is one of my most admired community pillars, because of his passion for the scene, but today I differed from him and for once, found his yelling rant to be frustrating and alienating. In almost every tournament, IdrA and iNcontrol are my [cock choices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=33V5n4F-rxs#t=33s), while Greg sat there with this (to me) gross attitude that says “well Blizzard haven’t done anything so lets ignore that and do something else” while not offering us anything of any actual substance as a suggestion. 

WHEAT was saying that we all need to stop believing the unfounded posts of a few and to look at the numbers ourselves. OK. As of right now LoL has more than 3x the viewers on twitch and is behind WoW (assumably because of the expansion). Over at Own3d, simply because it’s the same industry, but I didn’t spend the better part of 2 years dedicated to this game to see it give other games a leg up because the developers aren't paying attention. 

**The Light at the end of the tunnel and the Way Out**

So it all boils down to this: Blizzard are the only ones who are capable of winning my friends back. People say that nothing will happen because the development teams for WoL are too small or that they are spending too much time on HotS. The WCS is a step in the right direction, or that Cross-Server play is too complicated, that name changes must be paid for, that we have to wait for HotS for replays with friends, that it’s too difficult to make the online experience feel more community based, that it’s the tournaments fault when the drop screen appears. All these things add up and result in the average gamer feeling, at the least, and I believe we have the power to make them do it.

Nothing IdrA or iNcontrol say will change my mind on that (I want to really press the fact that i’m not doing this to target these guys

So here is what you guys need to fix

1) You absolutely need a confetti drop/air cannon. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoRBp4ztCr4 I feel like people really underestimate exactly how important this is especially at an awards ceremony. As soon as DRG wins at MLG and walks out of his booth

2) Music. This is also stupidly important. I'm obviously going to reference dreamhack, it is completely the tournament organizer. Watch the dreamhack video and listen to the crowd clapping in beat with the music. The whole point of music, is to fill the air and make it sound busy and !!!take the burden off of the audience!!! clapping and screaming for the minute or two after the match is over as opposed to letting them go crazy for 30 seconds, and then awkwardly fading away. In my opinion, the music should never stop playing in the arena once the games are done until there are going to be speakers, to carry the momentum of the final moments and prolong them as long as possible.

3) The Stage. I understand if MLG might be limited by the venue as to what they can do with the stage, think dreamhack, but it doesn't have to be used like they did. What's wrong with conducting a pre-match interview on the main part of the stage, and then have the players walk down the catwalk into the heart of all the fans and play right in the middle of them. This way, the players are more connected with the fans and are right in the middle of all the joy and passion and energy of the screaming clapping fans when they exit their booth after winning A FUCKING MLG TITLE!!!

""But Dave

Then fucking decorate your main stage and not simply with a few booths. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7krjklSLgfE This is a good example of what I mean where there is no thrust stage, constant music after he won until they're about to speak, go figure.

4) Have the trophy waiting on a pedestal on stage with a spotlight on it or something. A really big negative I get from these tournaments, make me and everyone else watching feel like all the players care about is the title. I've been watching starcraft for almost a year, but I still can't tell you what the trophy looks like, but I can name every sports trophy ever in existence. Fix that. And yes, it's your fault for not ramming that down my throat and making me know, not mine.

5) Rehearsals. Yes I guarantee MLG does run-throughs and dress rehearsals and the like

I feel like I might be missing some things, but make for such a better atmosphere than you already have.

EDIT: TL;DR Confetti Cannon.

EDIT 2: Im sorry if this has come across as a ""copy DH PLOX lolololol"" type of post, I was only using it as examples and that was just what first came to my head. What will make MLG better and honestly, appropriate for TV, is BUILDING ATMOSPHERE which MLG has all the build up but none of the POP at the end. It's like they're the exact opposite of a premature ejaculate. 

EDIT 3: Lets tweet at sundance so hopefully he sees this. My twitter is @Toffee_Dave so maybe just retweet my shit so he would see it? Let's all help make MLG and Esports what it deserves to be.

Previous reference (exactly 2 years ago today) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CAXidm7roE

I'll start by saying

The first thought I had at the WCS announcement was ""HOLY SHIT, it's incredibly discouraging that NA players will not only have to likely compete with a lot of SEA and CN players to qualify, but on top of that, with a lot of Koreans. As mentioned in the article, I can't help but to think the skill gap will continue to grow until we reach Brood War level, where a foreigner taking *A GAME* from a Korean was reason for talk and celebration for the foreigner scene.


I thought WCS was going to be the league to look forward to. With the prize distribution, let's make this shit happen. Let's grow the NA and EU scenes. We'll move to California, close to EG or NASL, and start building an e-sports city there in the hopes that other teams would follow, in the hopes that we can stay motivated and improve a lot, aim at a realistic shot of winning a good part of the NA prizepool."" 


But
For the last 3 years, we can stay on par with korea. We have something we never had in Brood War: an audience! A lot of money is coming from this side of the world, and it's going to the other side, for it to continue to grow in infrastructure and pull further and further ahead. 


My dream isn't to win 100k at WCS. I am happy with the money I make streaming. I am doing what I love for a living, ""I'm a professional gamer"" without people asking ""wtf"". Our gaming culture is so behind, our infrastructure is so behind - we seem to be a good 10 years away from having anything close to what they've got in Korea. The sad part is we keep refusing to even *start*. 


This isn't about the players, nor do they necessarily play more. Are they more organized? Hell yeah. They are a lot better at a ton of shit that we don't know/haven't learned. But they also got coaches, live with team-mates, have schedules, team, practice.


They eat and breathe SC2. 
Go try to eat and breathe SC2 in the US and see how fast you starve.

If I told you I'll give you $100
Would you go and swim every day? 
Would you stop going to work for it and practice 24/7 to beat Michael Phelps? 
Probably not
So whatever job you have/do whatever you do with your time will be better spent economically than practicing for something that you stand little-to-no-chance to win.

Now let's say I say, right? At the end of that, you'll find you're already a much better swimmer, best in town, and ready to compete in the State Championship. Then you'll give Michael Phelps a run for his money in the National Championships. You see how it scales up? 

There's motivation in between with archievable goals - goals that would have teams and players invest more time and dedication into the mindset and infrastructure needed to compete with Korea in the long run. I am not saying that players will be as good as Innovation after even a year. But perhaps two years down the line, prize pools, a GSTL or Proleague around international teams, coaches, and all of a sudden we're on even ground. The viewer base, the support, its all there. The infrastructure and motivation isn't - that's what we need to start building.

The example I used three years ago in a video was USA and soccer. USA has always been trash at soccer. Slowly they developed their own soccer league, to the point where they can put a good game against Brasil or France despite soccer not being super-duper popular in the US.

Now, to play against England and Portugal and Brazil and France. Well, they'd get shit on. They would be worth jackshit in the market, they would be the bottom of the food chain no matter how hard they train. Opportunities for them to be sustainable as professional players just wouldn't be there. People need to put themselves in the shoes of players here and realize that the great majority of them aim at top 16 MLG, which is shit money, because  - let's be honest - top 4 for an up-and-coming player is pretty much out of the picture. The best forgeiners travel to Korea in order to stay competitive. If it wasn't for visibility, the fact that mid-tier Koreans can still lose games to them, they would stand no chance whatsoever. This wouldn't be a feasable way of living. 
This is our job, I have a reason to play 8-10 hours a day. May not be the best practice ever and my mechanics aren't top notch, but the point I'm making is at least I can do it - most players can't.

Do you start to get it? You need motivation, we will *never* catch up to Korea. Sure, Koreans aren't rich, there's a lot of talent etc, but they have the infrastructure in place where b-teamers still get to eat and have a roof over their heads and all they have to worry about is playing Starcraft and performing well. How many forgeiners can you think of that are in the same situation, or have the opportunity to be in that situation at all? Not many. Not to mention culture, which we need to start growing *now*. In Korea, you can say you're a professional gamer without people wondering wtf you're talking about. I've met American progamers who are literally *ashamed* of calling themselves a progamer, or at least not taken seriously.

We need to start changing that. People need to stop saying ""You're not good enough, in my opinion, right now - would've never gotten a chance for anyone to know her had she not won a Playhem qualifier for IPL, where she didn't have to beat the best Koreans in the world, then she went onto IPL and defeated a semi-known Korean, and everyone was like ""WOW!"" Then she lost 1-2 to Oz  - an acomplishment in itself - and turned heads. Then she shined in WCS Canada where she won against *Canadians*. She beat HuK - widely considered one of the best forgeiners at the time. She beat *foreigners*. Then she went on to win WCS North America, defeating ViBE in the finals, practice with the best and live off the game she loves. 

Now let's play pretend and say Scarlett had to play Leenock or DRG in that Playhem qualifier tournament. She didn't make it to IPL

Do you get the point yet? It's not just about practicing, so that you can improve and set yourself attainable goals, rather than impossible ones. Korea has the culture, the infrastructure and the motivation. If you're completely cool with Korea being the mecca of Starcraft and e-sports forever, if you think that's sustainable, by all means - do what you gotta do. I'll stick around to see us fail like we did in Brood War. 

Every sport has regional leagues and divisions within them. You prove that you are the best in your city, then the world. You don't just prove you have talent in your city and get thrown in with people who have been doing this for longer and better. Look at college basketball, college football, and imagine freshmen thrown in on the NBA and NFL on their first year every time. 

Keep in mind, there would be a world finals, where the best in the world would always get the biggest piece of the pie. 
As a disclaimer
I'm not pushing for equality
Slow and steady is fine by me.

I beg of you and anyone who reads this to think carefully and empathize with players.
*Not with me*

Open your eyes, *ONE GAME*, off a Korean pro in BW was an amazing acomplishment - not to mention an extremely rare one. It'd bring a lot of satisfaction, but satisfaction can't buy food or justify the time investment to get better.

I think that a lot of people share a lot of the same views, in the long-run: we need to start changing, the talent is there, and i've struggled to do the best I can do with what I have to help develop and nurture talent over time, but it takes more than time and dedication, I feel like the community support is there for the most part, but we need to start taking baby steps if anything. 

NOTE: NO ONE is saying foreigners should not compete with koreans, and honestly little reason to do so - but that is not to say that regional leagues and tournaments wouldn't help grow and nurture a scene that will continue to go downhill otherwise, please trust me, I am doing as much as I can, since the game released.


 ROOT -WILL- open a team house in the US, and practice as hard as we can. The hope is that more teams will follow and we can start building a culture over here, build a 'Proleague' or 'GSL' in time, on this side of the world. I can do it, I can commit to it, because I stream and I make money like that, I can live off of gaming - Most NA pros and up and coming players -CAN'T- I am trying my best through ROOT to create opportunities always have

But if we're gonna make it as a scene

**EDIT: CLG one of the most prominent and well known League of Legends teams was planning to INVEST money into StarCraft 2, as the exposure these NA players would get by competing in a tournament with realistic chances of winning would provide CLG's sponsors. I as the owner of ROOT can only invest the money that we have and we have a fuckload of players already so growing more is close to impossible in terms of numbers for me, as I mentioned before, I try to as much as I can. For this reason alone, I volunteered to help CLG's management to find and foster North American Talent, provide these players with support and welcome CLG into our scene, we were throwing names around, CLG's business manager just msg'd me on skype:**

I want to personally apologize to you on behalf of all of us at MLG for the mistakes we made with the WCS America Qualifier this weekend. 

As many of you know

First, best of three bracket to maximize individual players opportunity for success, however that impacted the scale of the tournament. Additionally, we experienced strains on both our online product and administrative staffing that should have been avoided. Finally, we admittedly made a poor decision to try to hold back some results of the tournament in order to make spoiler-free viewing a possibility. We will not do that again for any online qualifier. 

We have immediately opened the final bracket to the public which can be found [here](http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/tournament/wcs-america-season-1-qualifyin/bracket). 

We have also created a feedback email address specifically for WCS America. Going forward

Again, the players and to Blizzard for failing to uphold the level of tournament execution we pride ourselves on. 

I assure you that we are making every effort to rectify this for all future WCS America operations. 

Sincerely

Sundance DiGiovanni

CEO

A little about myself...
My name is Evan Ju.  I am 20

Anyways

Until now, Destiny's Stream, reading sc2jokeexplainer, and etc.  However, I now really want to try my own hand in playing SC2.  There are obvious parallels between chess and Starcraft...strategy being the backbone of both games.  However, chess is purely a strategical and psychological game, while Starcraft has the added element of keyboard speed and mechanics.  Furthermore, starcraft is not.  

Basically
So far

One of the best parts of SC2 in my opinion is the community behind it.  There is a sense of togetherness and support that frankly is not felt nearly as much among the chess community.  I would greatly appreciate all of your guys' support as I continue my journey and plunge into the starcraft world :).  It would help me so much if you could like my Facebook page to stay up to date with my progress:  https://www.facebook.com/EvanJu1
and my twitter: www.twitter.com/Evan_Ju

TLDR: Top ranked chess player also trying to become a top SC2 player.  Liking my page helps me tons and I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!  

EDIT: wow!  I did not nearly expect this amount of support so quickly.  You guys really are the best.  Some people asked about the potential of a stream/blog.  I really intend on starting both of these soon (at least the blog, and twitter) and thanks again!

EDIT: I will reconsider the idea of waiting to start the stream before making masters.  I'll let everyone know via twitter/facebook/rstarcraft when I decide.  I am also very interested in taking lessons from top players if you have the time.  Having taken many chess lessons and as a chess coach myself

EDIT: I started a twitch.tv account: http://www.twitch.tv/evanju/videos 
      Not sure exactly when I'll start streaming SC2

1346434600.0,z58e9,I made a streaming application so I could stream startcraft.  Now it's open source and free for everyone,MadCactus,1549,376,438,"When I first had an interest in streaming starcraft and games for my friends to see

So, I have completed the first public alpha version of my streaming application.  This application supports capture cards, webcams, as well as software desktop capture.  You can make scenes, bitmap overlays, and it even has a plugin API so developers can add their own functionality to the application.  It's fairly simple in design, and relatively easy to use.  It's also written entirely in C/C++ and Direct3D 11 to maximize performance.

Best part is it's entirely open source and free.

There are still many features yet to be implemented (such as streaming to avi/mp4 files), but it's become very useable in it's current state, so I decided to bite the bullet and let everybody try it out in it's current state if they wish.

You can download it at https://sourceforge.net/projects/obsproject/

Important notes:

- Currently, but I will get around to making a proper setup application for it at some point

- It does not support windows XP

- There is a 64bit version available as well in the downloads section

- If using software desktop capture, as aero will absolutely kill your framerate and cause frames to lag.  Note that software desktop capture also does not support games in fullscreen mode.  You'll need to run the games windowed, or for startcraft/diablo, fullscreen (windowed) mode.

- The help file is incomplete but should have the basic gist of how to set up and use the application

- I have yet to document the plugin API

- Currently, such as own3d or ustream and such, I'll gladly add them to the list (in services.xconfig)

- It still is untested, or have potential difficulty with certain hardware configurations that I have not yet foreseen

- If you wish to make a translation of the app to your language, the english file, rename it to [iso 639-1 code].txt (example, ko.txt for korean), and then open it and translate the strings on the right.  If you send it to me, I will put it up and include it with the application.  Make sure to save the text file in UTF-8.  There is also plugins/DShowPlugin/locale files that should be translated as well.  Apologies for making them separate, but I really wanted to make the plugin as an API example.

If you wish to contact me

Also, I decided to finish mine regardless.  At the very least someone can learn something from my code, and that will leave me satisfied.

**Created a twitter for if you wish to follow for project updates.  https://twitter.com/OBSProject**

--------------------------------------------------
**Update** You guys work fast.  Thank you for testing it and the support.  As I expected

**Audio**: Certain microphones possibly may not work.  You may have to try another or disable your microphone in the time being until it's fixed.  Please email me your log if you have issues with your microphone.

**Speakers**: Some speaker configurations do not work.  If you get the ""Speaker setup not yet implemented"" crash, and it should work again.

**Video Unsmooth or Stutters**: Update!  This actually wasn't caused by the desktop capture.  This was caused by something else

**Software Desktop Capture not crashing, yes, I actually had this problem some time back, it was exclusive to the 64bit version, but it's possible it could happen with the 32bit version as well.  The issue was not with my app, but that microsoft libraries needed to be updated.  See if you're using the latest windows updates in your windows updates, and if that fails

If you read my Twitter and Facebook, I am excited to share the details behind this project with you as we are finally ready to launch! Today, I am proud to announce the SC2L (StarCraft® II League), Powered by D-Link! Our goal with the SC2L is to create a consistent, high-quality team league for the organizations in the West. We want the SC2L to become the Western world's premier team league.

Why the team format? Well, and in doing so help improve the quality of competition in the West, and the Western scene at large. This is why we are pushing as hard as we can to be the premier team league in the West.

SC2L's first season will be about two months long, ROOT, MouseSports, Acer, Axiom, EG, and Na`Vi, leading into an online playoff. The final two teams standing after the online playoff will receive travel and hotel stipends to compete for the **SC2L Season 1 Championship at DreamHack Bucharest

Our casting lineup for this season is really cool. SC2L Season 1 will be hosted and casted by some of the finest in the biz. I'll be your regular, Day[9], and Artosis.** I'll be bringing the casts to you live from our studio in San Francisco, with our co-casters joining me remotely via voice and webcam. 

Additionally, with D-Link's support, we are also proud to announce that SC2L Season 1 will feature one of the first crowd-sourced prize pools in StarCraft II. 

How does that work, D-Link will add $10 to the prize pool. So while SC2L's prize pool will open at $10K, it can be doubled to $20K with the help of our viewers!**

If you like what you've read so far, you'll get a discount on your purchase, and you'll add $10 to the SC2L prize pool! 

SC2L's first broadcast will be tonight, featuring Day[9] and myself. I hope you'll all join us as we kick off what we hope will be an awesome team league!  Also, if you'd like to read more about SC2L, check out our website at www.SC2L.gg!

1339493741.0,uxpf6,My take on the MLG player area situation,,1960,809,292,"The way MLG handles the player area as it stands right now is really bad. Plain and simple. We want to pretend that this is a competition where things like teams

This is really bad and annoying for a multitude of reasons that I will go through now.

Competition - Remember in DH when Tyler went in the booth and gave some support to his teammate? These are moments when teammates/friends CAN help change the course in history. It's also a huge part of what makes this game and others so great. If IdrA needs someone he trusts to calm him down and help him focus between games 1 and 2 why isn't that encouraged? It makes literally everything better for everyone. It's currently in the rules that players can't talk to anyone between games except for a ref but lets just ignore that at the moment since everyone does both at MLG and everywhere else because that is literally a nonsensical and dumb rule. As it stands

Spectator quality - As it stands right now some people pay to go to an MLG and see specific players compete. If they aren't streamed or on stage they may never see them play merely because the player area makes for horrible spectating. The answer is of course NOT to allow everyone into the player area but maybe more accommodations to be made for those that want to see someone play that isn't on the main stage. Lots of people tweeted at IdrA saying they were there just to see him play and they only saw him play a couple of times and the spectating quality was poor due to MLG format. Featured stations within the player area with monitors large enough for the audience to watch overhead OR having the matches streamed to another location on site.. something so when people want to watch IdrA or someone else they don't have to hope and wish he is on the outside computers otherwise they are in the dark.

Racism - MLG doesn't ask koreans to leave whether they are eliminated

We are not all the same - Yup, sorry"" every 5 second OR I am signing, taking a picture, talking, hugging etc etc.. I am either being kind of a dick for saying ""no"" OR I am literally not participating in my teammates match in any way shape or form. If I am in the player area I can do that x1000 obviously. Additionally, sometimes I need a break. I am fortunate enough to have a lot of fans and I really appreciate that.. but I don't want to be a zombie or rude to them OR be boring.. I want to have energy to express to them how excited I am that they  care about me.. but that means some times I need to catch my breath and charge up. Usually I do this while watching my teammates play and inbetween matches I go outside and sign more autographs and interact with fans. I really hope people aren't reading this as me being ungrateful or unappreciative.. I am.. but I also need to be realistic. I can't go to an MLG and be on call 24/7 ... I need breaks and I want selfishly, to be able to cheer on my team uninterrupted and be available to them. This essentially means I am asking to be treated differently than others and  I get that that isn't a popular notion.. sorry but tbh it's completely true and accurate. 

Now MLG argues it's a space problem and logistics issue that they aren't as concerned about and would rather focus on more important things. Fine

1328283920.0,p9c9h,UI still sub-par 2 years later. Why don't we care?,,2070,939,444,"*I initially posted this on TL, images and background information.*

------------------------------

Counting the beta

Sure. We've seen *some* improvement with chat being added. But it's telling that we had to ask for that in the first place. And we have vague promises for the map marketplace / arcade to fix the completely broken custom game scene with HotS. But there's so much more. 

Personally, I feel utterly alone, maybe play a game or two, and then leave again. Both in SC/BW and WC3, I'd idle around forever, hang out in channels or waste time in custom games.

So what`s different?

**Communicating and socializing is too hard.**

*Chat. It still sucks*. Simple commands like /w outside of games would make life tremendously easier. Real channels would be great. Or sending messages to my whole friends list. At the moment

Everything could be so much easier with a decent chat interface

*Clan support (+clan channels)*. This*rocked *in WC3. You had a place to meet with friends and clan mates

*Automated tournaments.* Where are they? Why was such a great feature removed? Despite losing quickly in most of them, and had an incentive to play for the portraits.

**Simply playing the game can be hard at times.**

*A working custom game system.* Despite the chaotic first impression

I had hoped to see countless maps by now, some TD maps and nothing too exciting else.
 
*AT vs. RT issues in team games.* While team games are looked down upon by many, it's still prone to abuse and frustration. Things like 2/3man ATs signing up for 3/4man RTs is just one example of many. Currently, the team ladders are a sick joke and the results / ratings and the general activity reflect the utter neglect with which this issue has been treated.

**Analyzing is overly hard as well.**

*Shared replay watching*. It was such a great feature in SC/BW. Requested since beta

*Statistics*. Where are they? Why can't I see my race-specific %

*The whole league system.* Sure, but only if you're looking at pros. I can't even judge whether I'm better than my buddy or not, because we're both in meaningless divisions of pointless leagues, and our MMR is invisible. 

------------------------------

Things went wrong when Blizzard decided to develop the new B.Net from scratch, but why for the love of all that is holy did *everything* that worked well in previous games have to be removed? Hell, the better part of Blizzard's fame came from releasing games with fantastic interfaces and great functions, yet SC2 is a step back (or several) compared to 2003's WC3 or even 1998's SC.

And why all this? Well, and the competetive 1vs1 crowd basically just needs a working matchmaking system (which is great, btw, and the only redeeming feature). But there's a huge number of players interested in socializing, custom maps and analyzing their play. Those that haven't left have grown complacent or jaded with Blizzard's ignorance.

The adding of chat and the scrapped forum real-ID feature have shown what players can achieve when the voice concerns; the complete lack of development in the meantimes is a great sign of how little will suffice for the majority to accept their fate. 

This game could be so much better.

I'm thinking you choose 5 (min) people to put in your party. And choose who wants to go first then after the first match you have a choice of who you want to go next. Maybe you could get an achievement for an all kill or reverse all kill.

1359475361.0,17i0wn,OK r/starcraft. There is something I want to get off my chest about balance whining (hyphen?),southernstorm,1802,707,518,"It doesn't matter what race you play. Maybe youre protoss and someone hated on FF. Maybe youre Zerg and someone lashed out at you for building infestors. Maybe youre terran and someone railed against the incredible cost efficiency of 3/3 marines.

**Even more universally, RIGHT NOW, people are balance-whining after a gg.

To all these people

If you played parting, how many games would you win?  If you can say anything other than 0, you are an incredible player. I cant.  So what, what does all this imply? 

Well

* every time you rage quit a game
* your ability to say this meaningfully is inversely proportional to your distance from Code S, great distance**    (see note below)
* if you are worrying about balance and don't yet have constant scv or probe production
* if you take a long view of it
* the difference between you and the league above you is either a balance patch or, and you have control of **1** of those 2 things.

Last one. It is much more subjective than the others

* you are making the game less fun *for yourself


Note from above: The fact that there are Code S players of each race in every single code S means that it is at least possible to attain that level as any race. Therefore, masters player, etc., that is fine, but you must still realize that it is possible for you to rank up to high GM as your race. But what will get you there isn't a balance patch. It is improving your play.

Whether you are playing for Aiur, lets have some GGs and improve together

**Edit 1** changed you into you are and changed phrasing of one comment just after posting

**Edit 2**  I am writing this edit because many people

I would like for you all to consider the following challenge:

I challenge you to try to help me make ladder more fun. Here's how: next time you lose a game that you feel is BS and you should have won
**In return I pledge to post 10 screenshots to imgur of me losing, 1 week from today.** After doing it, if you can say that you didn't learn anything from watching it and you're mad that you gged, then I apologize.  My suspicion, though, is that you'll feel - and play - better.

**Edit 3** Many people are bringing up very good counter arguments

* Note that I never said SCII is balanced. Further
* I am not saying that, I am saying that *using balance as an outlet to whine and vent personal feelings* hurts you as a player and hurts the community by making SCII ladder less fun.
* Last, like those blizzard has.

**Increase Fungal Growth radius to 5.0 (up from 2.0)**

We often see the Zerg players needing to use MULTIPLE fungals to ensure they hit a 200/200 army. This is RIDICULOUS. Increasing the fungal radius from 2.0 to 5.0 will ensure that 75 energy from a single unit should be MORE than enough to kill an entire 200/200 army.

**Decrease Infested Terran energy cost to 5 (down from 25)**

Sometimes in major engagements in the mid-late game we see parts of the screen that are not covered with Infested Terrans (or other Zerg units). This quite frankly is absurd and I'm not sure why it hasn't been patched already. Decreasing the energy cost to 5 will allow more Infested Terrans to be cast to ensure there isn't a single pixel on the screen that isn't covered in free Zerg units.

Do you live in The Netherlands or know someone who does? Send them to [our website](http://nssl.nl/tournament-info/finals-event-june-7th) and have them invite their friends through [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/events/155272411251778/)

______________________________________

*It's been a fantastic experience*. After visiting DreamHack Winter 2011 and meeting many pro's and casters (Day[9]!) I decided that we needed a SC-tournament in my hometown in The Netherlands. So I set up the [Nijmegen Student StarCraft League](http://www.nssl.nl) and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Not only did 72 participants from the Radboud University and HAN University sign up

But back to the NSSL! Like I said I've spent [countless hours](http://nssl.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SlimtimerNSSL.png) running the tournament - from setting up and maintaining the website

Now there's one last event coming up - the culmination of all that we've been working on: [the FINALS](http://nssl.nl/tournament-info/finals-event-june-7th)! On June 7th the semi-finals and finals will be played in front of a live audience in a large lecture hall at the University Campus. Several sponsors have stepped in to provide all the hardware that we'll need

But there's one thing I cannot do on my own: get out the word to as many people as possible about the finals. The event stands or falls with the amount of people that show up. Not only will it be much more **fun** if the room is completely packed with a cheering audience

So please - to all you Redditors - if you live in The Netherlands or know someone who does, and importantly: **invite your friends**!

I would be very glad to welcome you all at the finals

___________________________________________

For those of you who can't make it to Nijmegen there will be a live stream. Check it out on [Twitch.tv/NSSLeague](http://www.twitch.tv/nssleague)! Next saturday the last set of quarter finals will also be streamed live.

I can say I have never been so shocked with a bad attitude from a community until I played LoL and frequented the LoL reddit. 

Last weekend I was alone in the flat and turned on MLG SC2 coverage. It played a clip from the Starnation documentary. It brought a tear to my eye. I then proceeded to watch one of the best events of my life. A game that was beautiful played to perfection by players with passion. Casted by the best casters in the world. This is not a LoL bashing thread but by god is SC2 beautiful in comparison. 

Thank you Blizzard and everyone. Once I make some money I will buy HotS and never look back. 


PS. Feel free to down vote. I just needed this shared with folk because I love you all. Even the SC2 reddit admins rock in comparison &amp;lt;3

Edit: I just woke up. I cannot explain what type of a sensation this is. I feel so humbled and yet so happy to be part of a community that is so deeply empathetic and caring. Thank you so much.

ROOT is built on hype
	[–]Whiskerless 2 points 35 minutes ago
All people got to go on is Vibe's recent WCS win and Fitzy's getting to finals at the open bracket.
Yet everyone is convinced that ROOT is this unbelievable SC2 pro gaming team with a ton of accomplishments and I am way off base to even consider saying the're over hyped.
Although I am the idiot that went into the pit of dick riding fanboys and offered and opinion that might be viewed at a negative light. Shame on me.

----
sure, we didn't randomly make a post about our remaking and a bunch of people got excited for nothing, we have a history, clearly, you haven't been following sc2 long enough to know it, so let me tell you a story, and hopefully 'change your opinion' as you said you would.

Before moving onto the archievements let me tell you a little bit about our team; we recruited every member in the team based on potential and common goals, and we all still are. 

We forged strong friendships and a team spirit like i've never seen EVER before, kevin was our first recruit.

Did you know that fnatic didn't want Sheth -FOR FREE- when we took him under our wing? yeah Liquid'Sheth

Did you know that CauthonLuck became famous under our banner, TLO 4-0 and IdrA 4-1? nah, you probably didn't know that. he eventually lost in that Koth... to Slush

Did you know that SLush won the Team Liquid North America Invitational

Did you know that drewbie and qxc dominated almost every weekly tournament such as team liquid opens in the early days of sc2

You can talk shit about me and destiny all you want, its fine, Steven is moving to poland to train sc2 for a few months soon &amp; i'll do my best to prove you wrong on that front altough i do have some archievements of my own, wether you know them or not.  but you can say w/e u want about me, but don't you talk about my team without knowing anything about it, let me expand a bit on that:


in the beta, SGL the only clan league during the beta in the americas was won by ROOT Twice in a row (every time we competed in it) and every ""major"" NA team played in it

ROOT had FOUR (drewbie,kiwikaki) out of the top 8 seeds going into the 2nd MLG season, vs EG 1, Dignitas 1, Liquid 1, aTn 1 (IdrA/SeleCT/HuK/Socke), there was a meeting with the top 8 seeds and their managers, we liked to call it a team meeting. go check out some interviews on AskJoshy's youtube channel, almost every event.
ROOTKiWiKaKi was the 2nd highest rated player of the entire circuit circuit by points

ROOT had 5 in the top 8 qualifying players for IEM Americas (drewbie, suggy, cauthonluck) cauthonluck retired, being replaced by silver, ROOT took 2nd and 4th place at this event, FIVE IN THE TOP 8.

ROOT finished 2nd in the MRI, ROOT, Prime) - beating Prime and Liquid and losing to EG in a close match in the finals. note: ROOT's record vs EG before disbanding was 6-2 in clanwars played.

After ROOT's 'disband' ROOT's remains in Minigun drewbie and CatZ finsihed the job ROOT STARTED as a team in the EG Masters Cup #V finishing 2nd to Mouz in the whole league

Did you know that EG

Did you know that HuK wanted to join ROOT but at that point in time we couldn't let him in cause Sheth and him didn't get along? ofc they became great friends after

Did you know that drewbie and I practiced a lot and helped SeleCT when he first made his switch from Dota because of the potential we saw in him? he was ready to join too when dignitas made him an offer after winning his first tournament.

Did you know that ROOT was 2nd in the popularity polls on TL back in the day (only to Team Liquid) and that even today

You wanna know why people love ROOT so much? because ROOT members love the team so much, guess how many took the first offer? one: MajOr. Every other member of our team refused MULTIPLE offers and most of us stayed together against all odds until we disbanded. 

Because we're friends, because we know each other and can improve together, because we keep each other motivated and pushed each other to be the best. if that wasn't enough archievements AS A TEAM, here's just a few individual acomplishments that I can think of of the top of my head, from some of our members

drew: 
1st place MLG Winter Arena Qualifier NA
1st place NA Zotac Cup #1
1st place @ The Canadian Cup 2010
4th place IEM Season V NA Championship
1st TL Open #5 and #7
2nd Spaz&amp;justin Tv invitational
1st l2sc lan
1st goasucoaching #6
Top 8 Seed for MLG Circuit 2010
catz:
3rd place ONOG invitational
3rd place Blizzard L.A Invitational
1st place Justin.tv Invitational
1st place Eye of E-Sports Grand Opening
6th place IGN Pro League Season 1
2nd Miami sc League Lan (destiny won)
1st CSN After the Clash 2
2nd SK Gaming NA Champions Throphy
2nd Undeniable Tournament 9 
slush:
1st place MLG KotBH 9
1st place Team Liquid Invitational NA
multiple top 10 finishes at MLG incluiding a top 5 at MLG Colombus 2011
2nd EG Masters Cup #1
3rd EG Masters Cup #2
1st in -3- gosucoaching tournaments
kiwikaki:
2nd Place IGN Pro League Season 1
1st place LAN ETS
2nd place MLG Raleigh
2nd place MLG Dallas
2st place Success Pays Invitational
2nd WCG Canada
3rd FXO Path of Ascension
1st place ROOT Challenge NA
ViBE
1st place WCG USA Qualifier #4
2nd place Tactic 3D Tournament
1st place WCS USA National Finals

I hope that's enough acomplishments to change your mind, yeah we haven't played in much since, but in the little time we have, I think we're doing quite well, with ViBE winning the WCS USA and Fitzy falling 1 round short of the championship bracket at MLG incluiding a 2-0 on Zenio. Are we were we left of? again, no, not quite yet, we'll be working hard and we'll be putting a lot of time into this

 I hope this answers the stupid question of why we are hyped so much. We're not just entretainers bro, the community was essential to us sticking together, telling us all the time ""you can do it!"" we went without a penny for an entire year, thanks to the community, this time, we hope to stay much much longer.

so

Set a compressor to just barely be kicking in when the commentator's at their normal talking level

A downward expander (or a gate with a high floor if you can't get your hands on an expander) on the caster mic might get rid of some of that nasty room ambience for you. Use crowd mics to get your ambience back

Run the room audio off a separate mixer from your stream audio

EDIT: Omni lavalier mics are a very bad choice to use on your announcers who look like they're sitting in the coverage pattern of the PA... No wonder there's feedback. Get some directional headset mics and that should help you a ton. Something that's not held in by the ear canal

Mix the game audio to be sitting just under the announcers. Throw a compressor on there so that huge battles don't blow things up. Not an NASL thing, you don't have music sitting under the game. Turn that shit off.

The interview cameraman: Start with a 1-shot on the interviewer, STAY THERE FOR THE REST OF THE INTERVIEW, even when the interviewer is talking. Pull back out to a 2-shot when the interviewer wraps. If your camera doesn't have tally, stay on the shot several seconds after you think you're probably think you're not live anymore, and the interviewer should stay ""at attention"" for the same amount of time. Whip pans on air should be punishable by death.

Tell the players to not try to grab the microphone.

A little ""NASL"" mic flag would make it look so much more professional and would be really easy to make. A little cube of plastic with decals on the side and some foam inside to grip the microphone.

The casters: I find the endless crowd hyping annoying. This is probably a consequence of the caster audio being piped into the room, address the camera and your stream audience.

Whoever is setting up the matches and running the spectator computer needs to start making the player colors consistent from game to game. Either let each player pick what color they will appear as on screen (though veto any combinations that would be confusing)

EDIT: Watching Sheth vs. Puma right now... Purple and green are the worst colors possible for the players

Try and aim the booth cameras so we can see the players' hands. I loved MLG's booth camera angle. The hands are how the players are interacting with the game, as long as you can make it so it looks on screen like the players are ""facing"" each other.

Not an NASL thing, but the camera was on the announcers, showing a picture of the caster talking about the layout of the map. Totally fucking amateur.

The game video is noticeably delayed compared to the caster audio... Frequently a caster will talk about something before it actually happens. ~~No idea what could be causing this~~ EDIT: Oh wait we can see the mouse cursor. Second guess: Whatever frame sync you're using to get the video into your switcher is adding delay

He was pulling his mules off the minerals before they expired. Why? You may ask yourself. The mules don't complete their last trip therefore wasting the minerals they collect entirely on that trip.

This got me curious if this was true for close and far mineral patches. It isn't. The far mineral patches return the exact same amount of minerals over the mule duration (270) but the mule expires before taking 30 more from the mineral patch

 Everything I have heard has been terrans saying to mule the close mineral patches as the income is greater because they make the trips faster. This is true

What does this mean? Every mule on a close patch will waste 30 minerals (blue). It actually better to mule the far patches unless you intend to pull the mule off before the final trip. that 30 per mule will add up quickly to be a substantial amount. By the time the base is mined out you may have completely wasted hundreds of minerals.",self,t5_2qpp6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/of9oz/mule_efficiency/

MVP has battled criticisms about his plays due to being plague by a wrist injury. He is considered one of the best Terran (Starcraft 2 race) in the world.

The two met in a best of seven series played today in Seoul, speechless.

To the frontpagers interested in learning more about Starcraft; I would encourage you to visit [gomtv.net](http://gomtv.net) the host of the GSL tournament. I would also recommend visiting some of our largest fan communities, /r/starcraft.

I am still here in China with Carmac and he has showed me some feedback from this community.  I personally am thrilled with the abundance of positive responses to this tournament because of the passion I have for esports.  My son and I play StarCraft II - he always makes me bring home player autographs and other SC2 memorabilia.

I am glad that all the hard work that we have done with Carmac has paid off and that we were able to provide a great tournament for so many people around the world to follow.  Your feedback

The fact that it was so positive pushes me even further towards legitimising esports as a real sport.  I hope to see you at our events or that you continue to follow them online.

Hey guys! 

I have been a long time Lurker here on Reddit but have never made more than a few posts.

If you have any questions for me feel free to ask and I will do my best to respond! Depending on how late this goes I may doze off in a couple of hours but will do my best.

Theres only a few things I request not to be asked about:

1) Me and HD. I get asked this every day and have answered it numerous times. There is nothing bad between HD and myself. We simply do not cast together anymore. Its happend with other casters in the past and there is no crazy story behind it.

2) Questions about my income. This is very private information for anyone who has a job and is something I personally would never ask someone.

3) Questions about my super personal life. I personally like to keep some of my life private and dont gloat about who I'm dating (see what I did there).

I'm not going to blame a specific technical issue or put the blame on any one person to scapegoat them. A lot of things were messed up and blame ultimately rests with us. For all of those issues

What I can tell you is what we're going to do moving forward: We have listened to all of the criticism and, all the way from stream/technical issues, to tournament management, to production.

For every subscriber of our Twitch.tv HD pass that was upset

We now want to regain your trust through IPTL which will be launching tomorrow with the Amateur Division. In addition, to make sure we get things right.

We've just invested a huge amount into our studios

If you have any questions or concerns

Thanks so much.

I noticed Polt make an interesting decision in a TvP he played earlier today.  He opened 5 rax and pushed out at ~7:30.  When he reached the opponent's base at 8:00, and a stalker.  Upon seeing this, he immediately pulled back, finished his wall-off, put up 2 bunkers, in an obviously defensive position which allowed him to hold off the all-in that came a few moments later.

I'm a high masters terran and I would have never made that read; my question is what exactly did Polt see that triggered his defensive reaction?  Was the sentry count abnormally high?  If so how many sentries would be normal at that time in the game?  Also what stopped him from pushing up the ramp when he saw those units?  My first instinct would have been to rush up and try to pick off sentries since the zealot/stalker count seemed low.

Thanks for helping me! :)",self,t5_2qpp6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/t0zt8/question_about_decision_making_by_polt/

1. Canada. I have never been past the border up north. I have met many fans from Canada. They have a special flare of passion when it comes to eSports. This is very apparent watching the BarCraft Montreal videos.

2. NASL. From season one to season three this league has grown immensely both in numbers and in production value. The playoffs alone were worth me staying up to 3am. 

3. The community. The people surrounding this league

4. Huk. The hero of Canada. I remember watching as a cameraman back in 2010 as he sat on a pillow and wore a hoodie during his MLG matches. He's come a long way

NASL knows of my desire to host for them. In the end they have to make the decision that makes the most sense for them

Today is my cake day!  I can’t believe I’ve been doing my schtick for a whole year-- I thought this account would last a couple of weeks and then I’d get bored and move on.  I never really anticipated the amazing response I would get from this awesome subreddit.  


To celebrate, (iii) My biggest joke explaining fuck-up, (iv) My utterly terrible previous novelty account, and more! I remain in the bronze league of brevity, so this post is quite lengthy.  

***Favorite Jokes***

I decided to collect my favorite 12 /r/starcraft witticisms over the past year.  Note that these are for jokes that are, webcomics, hilarious interview moments, etc. don’t qualify.  Obviously, these aren’t objective and my own biases about humor are going to come into play.  

[12: Scanner Sweep](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/k0biq/scanner_sweep/)
Brilliant application of a hilarious scene featuring a nerd icon.  It also points out a foible of human nature.  I think almost everybody has futilely tried  to move their units outside of scan range despite knowing to a near-certainty that the scanner has already seen it.  This is

[11: Blizzard reveals new Zerg unit in Heart of the Swarm](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/l7kcl/blizzard_reveals_new_zerg_unit_in_heart_of_the/c2qg11v)

Absolutely brilliant.  I alluded to this in my explanation in the thread, fully expecting to see the silhouette of a hydralisk.  Jokes facetiously suggesting that hydralisks/carriers/reapers aren’t even in the game can be funny, but not “favorite joke” funny-- the concept is both obvious and used quite often, meaning that it’s hard to build an expectation-subverting joke with that punchline.  Hence, when I clicked through, there was a moment of surprise, about five seconds of confusion


[10: Always good for a surprise](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ku5i6/always_good_for_a_surprise/)

I’ve played all three races in both brood war and SC2


[9: We can all relate to this kitten](http://en.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/i2cql/we_can_all_relate_to_this_kitten/)

Simple

[8: If Dustin Browder designed bras...](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/j2j8s/if_dustin_browder_designed_bras/)

We’ve all been there.  Well

[7:I know a lot of you are new to SC2

I don’t even know why this made me laugh so hard.

[6: EMP Rage](http://reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/h63pp/emp_rage/)
I’ve done this.  More than once.  

[5: Day in the life](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/il73j/a_day_in_the_life_of_an_sc_redditor/)

It’s quite funny how there’s a “karma lottery” when there’s a really obvious submission.   Sometimes the prize doesn’t even go to the first person submits.  I’ve given up trying to submit anything

[4: A game theory analysis of PvP](http://i.imgur.com/zyQTR.jpg)
I actually didn’t save the thread where this came from and now I can’t find it.  But

[3: Tales from the War](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jqu7t/tales_from_the_war/)

We don't think of our units much from a lore perspective

[2: Why did the colossus fall over? Because it was imbalanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/geor3/why_did_the_colossus_fall_over/)
[A marine walks into a bar and asks


I include these together because they’re conceptually related.  I took some flak for arguing in the colossus thread that part of what made the joke funny was the inelegant and clumsy appearance of the colossus.  As I said, you could easily switch them-- why did the marine fall over?  Because he was imbalanced.  A colossus walks into a bar and asks, where is the counter?

It’s not as funny

[2: Fuck-yea Bronze](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/g6phy/introducing_fuckyea_bronze/).  I hesitated to include this on the list

The copious backstory: “Forever Bronze” was one of those things that was funny, then extremely unfunny, and is now occasionally funny again.  For those who weren’t around for the Forever Bronze heyday, it was (if I may quote myself) “a phrase used by Starcraft players to refer to players who are perceived as lacking the skills to earn a promotion to a different league, and the practices that prevent them from receiving a promotion”.  The problem with the Forever Bronze meme is that people quickly ran out of legitimate “Forever Bronze” stuff (e.g., [doing a double extractor trick and letting both finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/fxidj/forever_bronze_extractor_trick_first_post_true/) and started just coming up with bad decisions that were far less plausible: (I could cite a few examples here, but that hardly seems nice).

Enter ""Fuck-Yea"" Bronze.”  It proposed a meme that put bronze level play in a positive light.  My personal favorite is the very first one-- somebody who can be happy about a game where they lost at the ten minute mark but had three fully saturated bases has the right attitude and won’t be bronze for long.  In the context of endless “Forever Bronze” submissions, but all of us have the moment of exhilaration when we improve, even in the full knowledge that we’re way behind what the professionals can do.    That, my friends, is the true spirit of Starcraft.


[1:This is not a void ray](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ghk1o/psych/).  Sheer and utter brilliance, is objectively hilarious.  If you disagree, you are wrong.

This was held at,"" which was a wonderful place with tons of gaming systems everywhere, a stage for Rock Band/Guitar hero, a bar with its biggest monitors playing Starcraft streams constantly (even though football games were on), and people playing all sorts of games like Portal, NBA 2k11, and MW3. In short
  
All of the participants arrived ready to play, when suddenly more than half of us were unable to sign into battle.net. For a couple of hours, only a couple of the nearly 80 players were able to sign on, and finally we learned that our IP address was sending too many login requests and had been blacklisted by Blizzard.  
  
Even though our gaming venue had registered with Blizzard and contacted them, approving the white-listing of our IP address and giving us the capability to play. 
  
While I could make this discussion about LAN, by failing to provide support to our tournament, Blizzard made bunk the hours of work the event organizers put in to make this tournament happen.  
  
Because of the failure of the Blizzard support system and its employees

The conference will discuss the transition of OGN and KeSPA from SC1 to SC2. This is a big freaking deal. Without the BroodWar-related work of KeSPA, the SC2 competitive scene would be a shadow of its current self. In fact, Blizzard would probably not have designed SC2 to be a competitive title had BW not had such a healthy scene in Korea.

You can follow [TL's live report twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/TeamLiquidLIVE) for updates

EDIT 1: It starts at 10:30 AM KST

EDIT 2: ""Boxer, DRG, MKP, Leenock, Jjakji, Nestea, etc all present"" -- TL

EDIT 3: ""This event will be hosted by OGN Caster Ms. Jung and GomTV Caster Mr. Chae"" -- pgr21/ESFI

EDIT 4: The event has begun.

EDIT 5: ""KeSPA and OnGameNet have received official licenses to run and broadcast SC II leagues. SC II is now an officially recognized kespa game. KeSPA, and OGN have agreed to work together to help SC II esports develop in Korea, etc etc. Next season of PL will have SC2. No official word on mixed with BW, or just SC2."" -- TL

EDIT 6: More concrete information doesn't seem to be forthcoming. edit: OK

EDIT 7: ""KeSPA rep speaking now. I think I read ""BW + SC2"" hybrid in betwee the lines

EDIT 8: Flash: ""I wish for the global fans to give support to us SC1 players so we can bring our best games.""

EDIT 9: SC2 Licenses have been extended from Blizzard to all parties.

EDIT 10: This OSL might not be the last BW OSL.

EDIT 11: Proleague next season will be hybrid BW/SC2. The season after that will probably be pure SC2.

EDIT 12: KeSPA: ""We will look into how to integrate the Gom/GSTL teams for the all SC2

EDIT 13: OGN: ""We're preparing foreign broadcasts for SC II

EDIT 14: Estimated start time for OGN's SC2 league is early July.

EDIT 15: OGN: ""We haven't been able to talk to Gom in detail about cooperation

EDIT 16: Rights to broadcasts will be held by the individual broadcasters.

EDIT 17: You'll be seeing ex-BW pros playing SC2 in the third week of May. That's when the hybrid Proleague will start.

EDIT 20: KeSPA is being asked a question about the KeSPA-like organization that has popped up for the GSTL teams. Will KeSPA work with them? I'm not going to read the answer that KeSPA gives to that question. The real answer is ""We will crush them utterly.""
