I'm hoping to get some feedback and suggestions on what you would like to see in this if it interests you.   

-Who am I missing?

-What is your favorite beer from X brewery?

-What beer from X should you steer clear of?

-Something else interesting about the brewery? 

-What tastes like piss?

-Why are you drinking piss?



It should be open to comments if you right click on a cell.  If this gets enough interest I'd like to through it into the sidebar.

Just wanted to make everyone aware of a new Iowa subreddit (/r/IowaGamers) I've started that's geared entirely towards gaming

In my searching around Reddit it appeared that any events and information would be shared within individual community subreddits or just the general /r/lanparty subreddit

My hope is that this subreddit will become a location where Iowa gamers can come together and post/schedule events, and share their knowledge with fellow Iowans!

We'd love to have you! Please subscribe and invite your friends!

(Big props to tcpip4lyfe for allowing me to promote!)

This is a 4H camp where I saw many children who were shy and didn't think they had friends learn that someone always cares. I learned more about myself from that camp than anything else in my whole life

At the end of the week, or positively impacted you. I cannot describe the feeling of a child giving you a pin and telling you that you made camp special for them, or that you were the person who made them learn about themselves. I still have all my pins and will probably never be able to get rid of them. I want others to be able experience that feeling and have the chance to make impacts on kids in the same way that everyone else did.

This camp also offered special weeks for children of military families to come and experience camp and just feel like normal kids. They were with others kids their age who were feeling the same things they were, especially ones going through a hard time like their parent being deployed, deserve to have experiences like that.

This camp has done so much good, and staff. I can't imagine not being able to go out to the camp and immerse myself in nature. We are hoping to appeal to the group responsible for wanting to shut the camp down. Currently we are sending letters telling them of positive experiences, and why we feel that a camp that has done so much good should be left open for others to enjoy for many years to come.

I loved the Iowa 4H Center. If you have ever worked for a summer camp or a job where you have seen the positive impact places like this can make on children and young adults

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Iowa during the summer and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration

So, coming here off of fark.com and digg.com's heydays. 

One thing I haven't done, namely the awareness I have that this could be seen as ""selling"" something or ""spamming."" 

This has caused me a bit of cognitive dissonance the last few years because I feel as though there are articles that I earnestly would like to share here, which has further chaffed my resolution to avoid posting [LV content](http://littlevillagemag.com/) here (in the sense that I'd like to contribute, but am holding back).

The last few months, obviously, but I would like to start sharing articles, maybe two a week--maybe zero--which I think /r/iowa would find interesting. 

I want to be transparent on this because I think transparency is what I'm most concerned about here. With that said, I really do think this stuff is relevant for this subreddit, and it truly is, quite simply, ""OC"". It's written by people in Iowa, about Iowa, and it's really no more complicated than that. 

So, on /r/iowa if relevant?  

For reference

Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on proposed legislation to regulate intellectual property infringement online.

The Internet has spawned unprecedented opportunities for innovation, and global competition. Unfortunately, the Internet also produced greater opportunities for individuals to illegally distribute things like copyrighted movies and television programs, as well as to sell counterfeit trademarked goods or patented products. The impact of copyright piracy and sale of counterfeit goods imposes a significant cost. It hurts consumers and harms legitimate businesses and their workers.

While copyright, enforcement of the laws is particularly difficult, especially when a perpetrator is abroad. In recent years, the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am not a member, has attempted to address the enforcement challenges.

This Congress, which is designed to improve enforcement of ""pirate"" websites which facilitate the unauthorized distribution of protected content or counterfeit goods. The bill would give the Justice Department the authority to seek a cease and desist order against ""rogue"" websites that are primarily ""dedicated to infringing activities."" A similar bill, H.R.326, the Stop Online Piracy Act, is before the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet.

Under the PROTECT IP Act, Internet service providers, Internet advertising services providers, and location information providers to require them to stop financial transactions with the rogue site and stop linking to it. Also search engines-such as Google-would be ordered to remove or disable access to the Internet site.

In May, I have not yet had an opportunity to review the legislation in detail. However, as I evaluate the legislation, there are extremely important free speech issues that must be considered. In particular, it will be critical to me that the bill property balances the need for vigorous enforcement of our intellectual property laws with the important principle of a free and open Internet.

Again

 
Sincerely [fuck off  (op ed)]


Tom Harkin
United States Senator

**More details about our project**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

I am a little behind on when I thought I would be traveling through Iowa.  But the time is getting closer and I wanted to first thank everyone for their help

The dates of arrival are still up in the air. EDIT: I am leaving CA this Friday but not exactly sure when I will be in Iowa yet

here is where I'm going and what I'm doing:

Ames (would like to see this creepy doll house but can't find it on google) EDIT: was given the address

Cedar falls (a redditor offered to buy me a beer-then later deleted his offer-figured maybe someone else will?) EDIT: found out he deleted his account not the offer

Brandon (To see a large frying pan)

Mount Vernon (I was told to get lunch or dinner at the Lincoln Cafe)

So I hope someone is interested in meeting up! I will update and edit this post as much as possible if people are showing interest.

I have to mention that I have two dogs with me which are my first priority but I have done many road trips with them and never had a problem.


See Ya in Iowa!

-someone was kind enough to drop off water and fruit for the cause

-despite the number of people

-they had what was called a ""soap box"" where individuals voiced their reasons on why they were attending

-towards the end individuals were volunteering to stay until arrested in peaceful protest on the grounds of the Capitol.  (I may even help in the bailing out of said protesters here around 4 a.m.)

-multiple news crews Rolled up and started filming live however I'm sure it will probably edited to some extent

-protesters were made aware that if their cars on the Capitol grounds after 11 they will be towed

-had the opportunity to talk to 4 people who were arrested the night before who were taken to county jail and booked.  They all said the officers were both respectful and professional (figured id mention this since the Tony Bologna incident) CAN'T EDIT AND DELETE WHAT'S BELOW THIS SORRY!

We have Facilities available to make this happen in the Cedar Rapids area, There are a few things that still need some working out, such as a Roster of players available to make a trip to Cedar Rapids for this, a list of games to be showcased, like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Ect. Several locally hosted games for people to have fun with, a few non computer / console games and some prizes for the winners

I have been working with a few local Hotel's to make accommodations at a more than fair price for those that are willing to make the trip to the Cedar Rapids Area for this

After I can get a decent feel for the numbers, we would be happy to have as much support as possible to make this something that Iowan Gamers can feel beyond proud about, Hope to make it a reoccurring event so visitors use this as some home-state nerd cred / badge of honor, and be able to walk away saying ""I've played with the best in the Midwest"", or knowing ""I am the best in the Midwest.""

Hello Iowa...I'm the co-founder of a fatherhood website

This guy - Remy - is hardcore - he and his wife sold all of their belongings for this trip - and along with their two kids

**In short, Iowa, his bike is breaking down almost to the point of no repair, and he hurt his back. He has his wife and kids with him - and any help you can give him or the kids would be incredible. He's had people across the country to stay with along the journey, but a couple of unexpected stops, and a couple of drop-out hosts cost more than he anticipated.

If you are in or around Carroll, we'd appreciate it beyond words. **Please drop me a private message or answer here and we'll get in touch.**

Remy's longer story can be found [in these posts on our site if you're interested](http://www.8bitdad.com/tag/fatherhood-on-the-go/).
