This is very important to us in Montana (though it is important to all connecting states and Wyoming). Radio collared elk from those feed grounds have been tracked to Montana, which was documented (more cases go undocumented) 25 miles from the feed grounds this last fall, and other diseases as well. We cant afford to have CWD get into the feed grounds and spread it to Montana or neighboring herds. Once the CWD prions have been introduced to our environment (soil), the prions will remain active for 25 years or longer, possibly infecting and decimating our wildlife for generations. As conservationists, wildlife advocates, and hunters, as well as the legal court mandated action of phasing out the unnatural feeding of our wildlife

When people ask me if I have hope and if so what do I put it, and we only really give a damn about what we understand and appreciate. Time because no matter how naive, ignorant, or uneducated a people, a country, or a culture or society is, time will pass and new minds and thoughts and opinions will arise.  

The only thing is with conservation, how can we expect them to understand and then be advocates of more complex conservation and ecological issues. 

As a researcher I can only provide the most objective, tigers, wolves, bears, cycads, fisheries and everything else, that is not my decision.  Ultimately the only reason will will have these animals (or to a great extent intact systems) with us in the future, that these are things that matter to us and are important. And although there are many many many people who do care

So my question or topic of discussion is; how do we make people care and if they choose not to, and only protect that which has economic value? Or do we double our efforts, is it possible to do so? I'm open to any discussion, but I really want to know what you guys think of the future of conservation.  What is it that give you ""hope""?",,False,,False,t3_1kha3z

I am looking for a career as an interpretive park ranger or other similar careers. I have been searching for opportunities for hands on experience in my field and I stumbled upon the SCA. It looks very promising and seems to be just what I was looking for. I have heard pretty much all good things about the SCA but not too many details. Before I go about filling out my internship application and applying for various positions

How should I go about filling in my application? Should I be as detailed as possible? There is an essay section. What exactly are they looking for in this essay? 

How competitive is it to get a position? Are they very selective? Do I need previous experience and a ton of knowledge for most of the positions? 

How was your experience with the SCA? Did you find the position you wanted? I am fine with a less than ideal position. Did you find a less than ideal position but gathered plenty of experience? 

Is it any more difficult to find a position in particular seasons? Summer seems ideal for a long internship position but unfortunately I won't be available during summers. 

I want to immerse myself in a hands-on experience like what the SCA provides to see if this is what I really want to do or maybe there are other similar opportunities. I am willing to take time off from college to do this. Is this a bad idea? Are there other opportunities similar to SCA that I should know about first? 

I would appreciate any help from you folks. ",,t5_2rbpn,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/yxzdc/student_conservation_association_and_other/

I am graduating with a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in May from an American university and plan on taking a gap year to work and gain some experience. I plan on getting a Master's degree at a European University (perhaps through an Erasmus Mundus program) after that, from the age of 8 months to 18 years (this is relevant).

I’m very interested in the intersection of conservation science and society in developing countries. I’m fascinated by situations where conservation cannot be efficiently, the more I think about it, the more I see my life taking me back to Africa in some way as a bridge between conservation science and implementation, and between conservationists and local, marginalized groups. My interest in urban ecology would be fulfilled in Africa, too, as cities continue to grow at unprecedented rates and as conservationists begin to implement schemes beyond protected areas. I firmly believe that this can be done in a non-imperialist (""pro-poor"") fashion that empowers developing countries and does not occur at any other country's ""expense.

My only problem is, any other sources are appreciated! Are there any books/articles you recommend I follow up on, any people you recommend I contact? 

In addition, but they either offer unpaid internships or high-ranking jobs (regional managers and such). I’m excited to get started on something ASAP (i.e. gap year, if possible) and I really need more creative ideas. 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this long post! Cheers

Spending the first few years of my life in the Rockies, and constant threat of losing it I've decided that  wildlife conservation is a career I want to pursue; especially for the (ex)endangered wolves. Sadly I don't really know where to begin. Currently I'm enrolled in a community college, that offers 3 free academic years then allows you to transfer your credits to a four year university. My major is undeclared, and I'm mostly just hashing out my gen-ed classes. Past posts recommend to go out and network, which I plan to do with my local Sierra Club chapter.

* What majors and minors would be most beneficial to receiving a job in this field?

* What colleges have good programs in said majors

*  [An instate College](http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=486&amp;Itemid=297) may be the cheapest option. Which of these colleges have a ""good name"" in forrest conservation? Or where would be the best place to research on said college.

* What are some other

As such

The **first** port of call for general interest and pictures is:

**[ARKive.org](http://www.arkive.org/)**

ARKive is a project that aims to collect media (photos, not too technical, and a way of getting people interested in beautiful species. They often use university students to write the information, using peer-reviewed papers. I wrote an entry on the [Gabela bush shrike (*Laniarius amboimensis*)](http://www.arkive.org/gabela-bush-shrike/laniarius-amboimensis/) (my name is not in the credits, though - the reviewer/checker is credited rather than the author).

I would use this to find pictures and basic information about a species I'd just heard of

The **second** place I'd look would probably be the:

**[IUCN Redlist](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)**

This is a very highly regarded (read: bible) for anyone involved in conservation. They provide the 'official' conservation status (i.e., and provide distribution maps and population estimates. 

Their database is very big, but the largest useful database in the world. 

Using their search engine, proportion of described species that are threatened, etc.

Sites like Wikipedia are useful, so better to go to the source, as it is more up to date, comprehensive, and in a simple, consistent format.

Any prospective students will come to be very familiar with the IUCN Redlist. I would recommend hunting down a ""Global Species Assessment"" from the IUCN - I have one from 2004

**Finally**, using the scientific name I'd found on ARKive or the IUCN page. You sometimes (actually, often...) need a subscription to the journal which is quite expensive. You'll be able to read the abstract, which gives a summary of all the useful information, though, and is often all you need. If there's a paper you're desperate to read, send me a message and I'll see if I can send it to you (though I'm not at university and so can't use their organisation subscription

I suppose this is a very verbose way of linking to three sites

EDIT: Also, the number 1 mammal is the Yangtze River dolphin (*Lipotes vexillifer*) - sadly, I had a lecture from the guy behind the conservation efforts on this species, who told us in no uncertain terms that is was extinct. If it wasn't, and there were one of two hiding somewhere, they'd die soon along with the species. 

EDIT: The IUCN also does a **[Species of the Day](http://www.iucnredlist.org/species-of-the-day)** feature - click the image for a PDF profile each day.",,t5_2rbpn,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/de427/resources_for_conservation/

I'm involved in organizing a student conservation science conference in Australia. We just had a look at the stats and Google analytics and as of now, I was wondering how I could get more efficient exposure of the conference to postgrad students in US universities.

Are there any email lists, of emailing academics and admin staff at the biology/ecology/geography departments of the main universities.  

thanks a lot
the website is http://sccs-aus.org/ in case anyone's curious.

I saw a car hit a beautiful dog. The dog slid twenty feet off the road and go into a creek. The car drove off and didn't look back; I know they knew they hit it because the car came to a stop. The dog then walks out of the ditch limping and whining. I get a better look it has internal damage. It is bleeding through its mouth and has broken bones everywhere. I get to look the dog in the eyes and all I see is fear. Fear. FEAR. FEAR! I am now stopped in the middle of the road in the pouring rain chasing down a dying dog. The dog gets to the side of road and into the creek. I get back into my car and drive away
I drove home crying and stared my cat for the past hour. I am now finally writing this down because I don't know what to think of myself. Am I as bad as the person who hit the animal, can I someone tell me what they would of done and I also wanted your honest opinion of me?",,False,,t5_2rbpn,False,,
