All the interviews didn't turn out well for me.

So on that day

Mom waited in the parking lot while I had my interview.

The boss and some director came to interview me. The director was a real douchebag. He took a quick look at my resume and said:

""What is this, huh? Sorry but we cannot hire you. That's it. You can leave. Let's not waste our time.""

When I came back to the car

""The radio station said it's gonna get cold again tomorrow... Are you hungry? Let's eat something on the way home honey""

We didn't talk a lot and went to an Italian restaurant nearby. We ordered some spaghetti.

That's when mom said: ""Maybe you are lucky and they hire you this time."" ... Well that was awkward. For what seemed like minutes I could not reply anything and finally I said. ""No mom

Smiling

I really started to feel sad at that moment and felt so sorry for mom. I really want to get a job and want to make our lives easier.

There's been an issue recently concerning the amount of posts that are simply Youtube links to depressing music. As we all know, are completely subjective and we're not judging you for liking or disliking a song. However, it feels as if simply dropping a link to a song that gets you a bit feely isn't what this subreddit is about - it promotes no discussion, no thought, and often no real immersion into emotion.

For this reason, 15th of July 2013 (GMT+10)**~~, we are only allowing [MUSIC] posts if they are posted as a text-based post, with a short (*not* one line) description of the song, its meaning, how you perceive the song and/or how the song makes you feel.

I remembered what you said.

You told me not to drink

So I drank soda instead.

.

I really felt proud inside

The way you said I would.

I didn't drink and drive

Even though the others said I should.

.

I know I did the right thing

I know you are always right.

Now the party is finally ending

As everyone is driving out of sight.

.

As I got into my car

I knew I'd get home in one piece.

Because of the way you raised me

So responsible and sweet.

.

I started to drive away

But as I pulled out into the road

The other car didn't see me

And hit me like a load.

.


As I lay there on the pavement

I hear the policeman say

""The other guy is drunk

And now I'm the one who will pay.

.


I'm lying here dying

I wish you'd get here soon.

How could this happen to me

My life just burst like a balloon.

.

There is blood all around me

And most of it is mine.

I hear the medic say

I'll die in a short time.

.


I just wanted to tell you

I swear I didn't drink.

It was the others

The others didn't think.

.

He was probably at the same party as I.

The only difference is

And I will die.

.


Why do people drink

It can ruin your whole life.

I'm feeling sharp pains now.

Pains just like a knife.

.

The guy who hit me is walking

And I don't think it's fair.

I'm lying here dying

And all he can do is stare.

.

Tell my brother not to cry

Tell Daddy to be brave.

And when I go to heaven

Put ""Daddy's Girl"" on my grave.

.

Someone should have told him

Not to drink and drive.

If only they had told him

I would still be alive.

.

My breath is getting shorter

I'm becoming very scared.

Please don't cry for me

When I needed you

you were always there.

.

I have one last question

Before I say good bye.

I didn't drink and drive

So why am I the one to die?

That summer

The year school systems were brought back to southern Louisiana

She always knew when I was sad.



For the past few months

My family has been in debt recently and we couldn't pay for her needs

About three nights ago


What a mistake.


The lady at the counter thought we abused the dog and that's why she did that. She was rude to us and said we don't deserve her and we will never get her back.

 Alright I have a friend who we will call M who lives in California

They saw each other several times a week and they were happy together. Then in one week it completely turned around. His girlfriend had 2 months before she was to move to Oklahoma. Then 2 days after that his mother was put in the hospital where she was diagnosed with lung and kidney cancer

 I kept telling him that he needed to be there for his mother but his mind was completely consumed by this girl that he had only been for a few months. As time went on he became even more consumed with the thought

 So they spend the very last day together before she moved and according to him it went by too quickly and he was just incredibly depressed

 He had doubts before about her cheating but then over time came to trust her only to be cheated on. The first love of his life and the person to take his virginity completely destroyed him. I have not heard from him since that night when he broke it off with her which was about two nights ago and I am worried because he said he wanted to kill himself. I am not sure if he did or what is going on but I still can't get over how tragic it must be to have your heart completely torn apart like that. Not only did he completely lose his first love (Which I have no doubts he will one day find another woman who will actually treat him right and he can finally be happy again) but he is going to lose his mother soon. I couldn't even imagine it. I wonder how he will be with the whole church thing now though... Whether he will stay with the church or not.

I haven't cried this hard in years. I lost my grandfather two months ago, and what he wanted.

I haven't cried this hard in years. Not since I lost the dog I grew up with. 14 years. 14 goddamn years we spent together. The moment I got home from the hospital, she would sprint into the trees. Off to find some scent she picked up. But she always came back. She always came sprinting back out of the trees, and I would always go to meet her. I'd pet her and send her on her way, of course. I couldn't keep up. She was young. But not a puppy anymore. I was just a kid. I didn't want to hold her back, she'd have more fun if I just trundled along at my own pace. She was my first word. The first thing I ever said was her name, and years later she still answered to my version of her name. Azi, I called her. I couldn't pronounce the ""T"" but she didn't care. She came over to nanny me anyway. She was always there with me when I was sick, but she wasn't very young. I always spent time with her. If I had a problem, but she moved a little slower now. Now the tables had turned. She couldn't always keep up with me. I was kind of fat, but not too well. She got tired. She would lay in the main traffic areas of the house. At the entrance to the kitchen

Two weeks. Two weeks was all it took. I know why she whipped our puppies into shape. She knew what they were. They were her replacements. Because that's all life is

It's been 7 years. For seven whole years I've been waiting. I've been holding back, Tazi, and I love you. I still do, I promise. I didn't forget. I still keep that last t-shirt you used hanging up on my coat rack. It's still got rips in it from where you shook your head just a little too hard. I know what they say - ""Think about all the good times you shared!"" And I do, I promise. I won't ever forget. But I miss you. I wish you were still here, so I could make more good memories. But you aren't.

All I can think is that she thought she was going with my boyfriend since he had just left a few seconds before. The door was still open because my boyfriend's brother was smoking a cigarette. I went to grab the leashes to take our girls out on a walk. I didn't even think about the fact that my boyfriend had just took off on his bike

I dropped everything and bolted out the door after her... our other pit, but I couldn't get there fast enough to pull Girlie out of the road before that semi sent her flying. I felt everything inside me break all at once, my heart in my stomach, my feet like stone as I came to her and pulled her to the curbside, tears running down my cheek. My boyfriend was only a block up the road. He saw Nina in the street and snatched her up, not even seeing me on the side of the road with our other girl. I heard him when I realized what had happened. The sound of his cry for Girlie shattered my world.

I carried her back to the house while he carried a struggling Nina, I severely regret taking her there.

They took her to the back, even though she was responsive and wagging her tail on the way there. Then they informed us that any trauma center we took her to would require a deposit before even looking at her. That is EXACTLY what they told us. 

We couldn't afford to take her anywhere. On August 2nd, but no one would be there past 5pm to watch her through the night. The only option they left us was to put her down.

It took time for me to sign the consent form. I was holding the pen and staring at the signature line and all I could do was cry. Girlie had been with us for two years. We had adopted her from a pitbull rescue to be a friend for Nina, who wanted nothing more than to go bye-bye in the car and be petted and adored. She did not deserve this. She did not understand what was happening to her. 

In the end

It was over so quickly. They let us spend some time with her before it was time

I cried all the way home. While my boyfriend dug her grave, she slept in bed with him. She was as much his Girlie as she was ours. She was his best friend. She was like my own child. And we weren't able to save her.

We're keeping her collar and leash. We're going to get her name stitched into her collar and I'm going to keep it for as long as I live.
