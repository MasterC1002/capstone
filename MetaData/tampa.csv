The first step is to march on [/r/lakeland](http://reddit.com/r/lakeland) and tell those few souls that we are declaring Lakeland to be an official part of Tampa.  Once we have expanded East we will have created a Tampa border going all the way to [/r/Orlando](http://reddit.com/r/Orlando).  We will then move into the [/r/Sarasota](http://reddit.com/r/sarasota) reddit and tell them that it is time to band together as west coast bretheren.  Having joined them to our empire we will need to consolidate our forces so the next stop is to invade the stronghold of [/r/USF](http://reddit.com/r/USF) and assimilate them into our Empire.  They have no chance

The road may be long my brothers and sisters but the [/r/Tampa](http://reddit.com/r/tampa) empire is strong.  Now lets go to [/r/Lakeland](http://reddit.com/r/lakeland) and give them their new masters.

My name is Michael W. Johnson and I just put my name in the write in block for Florida State Senate District 22.  The other option is Republican Jeff Brandes (who I know just enough about to disagree, don't we have enough Republicans running the state already?).  My political party?  Presently I'm a registered Democrat, but only because at present, literally today, its closer than Libertarian or something else.  Why don't we say Toga Party.

Is this a joke?  No, I figured by the time I'd be filling out the ballot that someone would have stepped up but I've found nobody.

Do I have skeletons in my closet?  Sure.  No dead hookers, no illegal alien employees.  Weed?  Yeah, sure.  Not today or in the recent past, but *ever*?  Sure.

Am I trained for public office?  Well, having served as a medic I received an honorable discharge.  I have an Accounting degree, but presently work in IT (sales though, so I'm no wallflower).

There are plenty of folks smarter than me

So, you could absolutely, positively do worse and nobody better has stepped up (unless you're happy with the default Republican, then knock yourself out).

TL;DR:  Republican running unopposed for Florida State Senate District 22; write in Michael W. Johnson (Independent).

EDIT:  [**There**](http://imgur.com/0KpTe) you have it.
EDIT 2:  Okay, casual review seems to show District 22 as still being in Orlando.  If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd say this was by design.

1297949553.0,fn6hj,Rick Scott is a DICK and doesn't know squat about trains!,gannon6790,54,13,61,"I'm pretty upset with our Governor.  

I'm fairly certain he did not give the high speed rail a fair shake.  

I feel like he's refusing the project simply to ""oppose the president's agenda."" ie - cutting off his nose to spite his face. 

I don't think his stated reasons to refuse the project are valid.  

1. I've heard it reported that rail companies have offered to take responsibility for maintaining and operating rail line

2. Scott stated that he was afraid that if the project got canceled during the construction due to cost overruns the state would have to repay the billions given to the FDOT by the Federal government.  This wouldn't be a cost to the state

3. I would give some credence to arguments about ridership being less than projected.  But I bet the ridership projections are more likely to be short than overly optimistic.   When looking at a large project like this engineers and analysts should be using conservative numbers and projections.  and often you end up with a chicken and egg argument like the following: why would people ride on a train if they can't get around in the city once they get there?  both Hillsborough and Orange county have rather poor (IMHO) bus systems. often i've heard our buses run around mostly empty.  But once the train is available

We

I'm sure they exist, I just wanted to get this out there.  I'm going to cross post this to as many Florida/other reddits i can we well.

TL;DR - Scott is a DICK who doesn't know anything about trains.  Lets tell him!

2ND EDIT: No money changed hands (meaning, but a meeting of the minds was had. Someone finally listened, and that in itself was gratifying.

======= READ ABOVE THIS LINE FIRST =======

Someone was talking about how poorly their Bright House service was working

BrightHouse Networks owns the local monopoly for Internet access in my area (North of Tampa), my hand was forced into choosing them, but because I had no personal negative experiences with the company (and there is literally no other choice), I ignored all of the complaints I read on the Internet.

Things went downhill right from the beginning. They missed the install appointment without calling, but no record of my account.

Once everything was installed, but was told my account didn't exist. However, this rep was a smart cookie and realized that the phone system was routing me to the wrong division of BHN: I was talking to the Orlando people, but needed to be talking to Tampa. Frustratingly, this same thing happens every time I call, so I try to avoid calling them. I sit on hold forever in Orlando, just to be told they have to transfer me to Tampa. You'd think I could call a direct line, it takes over and ""helpfully"" transfers me to Orlando.

BHN sent a tech out. Heck, and it wasn't something that could be resolved. Luckily, one of the techs felt so bad about the ridiculous speed (it took over a minute to load web pages, and half the time, it just died) that he called a buddy (Jesse — go Jesse!) who knew more about ""special"" BHN issues than the standard techs. Jesse came out and said ""Wow, dude, you have that cable modem? It sucks. Try a different one."" We swapped it out, and said wasn't their problem. Stay classy

Next, but it'd happen several times per day and who wants to wait 10 minutes for a DVR to reboot when you're in the middle of watching or recording something? Speaking of the DVR, it was completely useless because half the time cable service would die in the middle of a recording so there'd be half a program or just nothing in on the drive. Yet, we paid every month for the ""privilege"" of DVR service. We added a regular cable box for the bedroom, thinking that it was a DVR issue, but this box had the same problem.

Finally, since we've be moving two days after we returned. We scheduled this WAY in advance (months!), so there was no issue. However, when we got back, service was still somehow on. Perplexed, I contacted BHN. They said that our trip was too short by one day, and that disqualified us for service suspension. They couldn't go back and turn it off earlier or keep it off longer

I was fighting on and off with customer ""service"" about this issue, but the tech never showed up to get the equipment. I mean, seriously? And guess what? Yup, they kept billing me anyway. I had to send my Dad to get my cable boxes (I wasn't home for another month at this point, during a busy travel season) and return them to the retail store. Later that month, I sent my girlfriend to do the same for the cable modem.

I thought I was finally done,"" who was wholly unable to even understand the issue(s) I was having, and chose to simply berate me instead. I disconnected with him and decided that I'd just cost BrightHouse business by telling everyone who'd listen my story .. and this isn’t even half of it!

I figure they've stolen over $1, so asking them to delete my $150 ""final bill"" seemed pretty reasonable .. especially since their techs failed to pick up my equipment, so I wouldn't even HAVE a ""final bill"" if they’d done their job.

Since that time (it's been a bit since I've moved a town up -- maybe about 6 months), and even a stranger to switch away from BrightHouse. If you figure the average cable &amp; Internet bill is $150/mo, I'm costing them $1,800 per year PER PERSON that I convince to switch. That's over $10,000 this year alone .. and they could have easily avoided it by not making an enemy out of me. Go figure.",,False,t5_2r7ih,True

The upstairs is reserved for us from 8:30 until 11 and is an awesome area with a rooftop bar, tables, etc.  We are free to go join the general group downstairs on the dance floor if we like.  We still have that area after 11 but they will begin allowing people up after that. 

See [This Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1135v0/best_place_to_park_in_ybor/) for optimal places to park in Ybor and rates.

 Just remember food will be there at 8:30 and it stops being a private party at 11:00 PM so don't show up 3 hours late to this one!   We have plenty of space so feel free to invite some friends.  I'm sure the party will go far past 11 as we begin to mix with the general public but don't worry


I will be  providing some basic party food.  If you want to help with food please PM me with what you want to do or are willing to do and I'll get back to you.  Mind-Reflections has volunteered to be our DJ for the evening.

Since this is an outdoor venue there will be a backup date in case of inclement weather.  I'll address that in more detail if it looks like it might come up a few days before the party.  

Please post if you are planning to attend so I can get a very rough estimate of how many will show up.  I don't expect it to be accurate but knowing within 10-15 people would make planning much easier.

I have recently moved to this area and am on a quest to find a worthwhile dentist. I will break the review down into 5x sections for rating, Time Management

The following review is based off a scheduled root canal (non-emergency)

**Facility**

Coast Dental @ Hyde Park is located in an overal nice neighborhood.  Conveniently located next to a bewilderingly small hospital


**Assistant Efficiency**

3x of the dental assistant women were very friendly and out going.  two of the older dental assistant's always walked around with scowls on their face and repeatedly interrupted my operations to ask questions of the dentist.  i picked up that the lead dental assistant thought these two were idiots.  When i originally made the appointment


**Pain Management/Dentist Skill**

I will preface this section stating that **have** had a root canal by my previous dentist in philadelphia and know what is normal pain and what is bad pain.

This dentist did not give any sort of foreplay when it came to the needle.  No Topical, most of the top of my mouth was swollen with the lidocane. 

As far as the Dentist's skill at actual tooth care... it is too early to tell.


**Time Management**

This one was a HUGE biggie with this dentist.

As previously stated, he left to go do some fillings.  45 minutes later the dentist comes back and puts a clamp on my tooth to isolate it from the rest of my mouth.  The dentist then disappears again for a consult. Another 30 minutes pass.  Finally the dentist starts drilling.  As soon as he hits the root, i begin to spasm from the pain.  Doc shoves the needle back into my mouth unceremoniously then disappears again.  twenty minutes pass and the il-fitting clamp begins to dig in to my gum.  I get up and go find the DA to tell her that i could feel the clamp.  Dentist comes back for 10 minutes, cusses then says "" screw it, we'll have to pack this up and have you come back next week""  

appointment started at 8am.  i returned to work at 1pm in severe pain.  

&gt;&gt;tl;dr the dentist overbooked a time slot resulting in half done root canal for two weeks.

The next appointment went pretty much the same just that we finished.


** Price **

1x root canal =$2500 with dental insurance that covers 55%

a pretty steep price for the amount of pain and time wasted.

**EDIT: ** forgot the part where he dropped a drill bit into my throat and had to go digging with forceps. Good thing I don't have much of a gag reflex.  ",self,t5_2r7ih,1348931457.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/10nz8d/dentist_review_coast_dental_hyde_park/

They are seeking donations for a young mare named Sara. She was a thoroughbred at the start of her racing career when she fractured her hock mid gallop. The owner has since waived all rights as the owner because they didn't want to pay the vet bills to try and save her. 

This is the common outcome of horses on the track all over the country. They're over bred

Sara has 3 weeks before the window opportunity of treatment is closed. She needs a sling to relieve pressure from her fractured hock.

By the way I need a large group of people to meet at Curtis Hixon park.

The above is the website for the scavenger hunt that I am doing and I have to do as much as possible by Saturday. My team is called  TheTeamFreeWillLovesDecepticons. We are from all over the US and my friend Brandi and I represent the Tampa department. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iysBt7Xqro

I can't find a good summary video but the above was from last years runner ups. 

This is all being facilitated by Misha Collins who played Castiel from the TV show Supernatural.

--------------------------------
Fellow Tampa redditors

I need to borrow the following items or help: (I will return your items after I take the picture or video)

1) I need three bearded men in ballerina outfits to successfully receive candy from treak-or-treating. (or if anyone who has adult sized ballerina outfits that I can borrow that would be wonderful)

2) I need a chicken suit to borrow

3)I need a group of people who is willing to be an abacus (thinking of doing this at Curtis Hixon park)


3) A four-post queen sized bed with headboard and foot board that I can borrow...And you are willing to let me put it at a Wal-mart parking lot so I can sleep on it. Heh.

4) A full storm trooper outfit 

5) A four-leaf clover (must still be green) and a person with a nose piercing. The four-leaf clover MUST have a stem.

6) Some strapping young (aw hell old would be fine) fire fighters wearing skimpy clothing out of kale. Bonus points if you have access to a hose we can shot water in the air in the background.

7) A uniformed veteran I can hug

8) A burrito and taco suit my friend and I can borrow

9) Some coats I can donate to a local shelter

10) Is there any real Olympic gold or silver medal winners in the area?

11) A couple who has been married for over 60 years sitting on a couch and sharing secrets to a happy and lasting partnership

12) Some ducks and geese I can play duck duck goose with

13) An orchestra that can play Kansas ""Carry on my wayward son."" (I play violin myself)

14) A flight attendant outfit

15) TV News station mentioning either my full name/team member's full name or the full team name. (The team name is TheTeamFreeWillLovesDecepticons)

16) A mariachi outfit

17) 10 people and a guy playing a snare drum in a mall. If you don't wanna participate but have a marching snare drum I can borrow that would be great.

18) A rock band with 1000 fans would be great. If you are in a rock band but don't have 1000 fans

19)A black and white TV set powered by antique stream-fed wooden watermill. Be sure there is a way we can get an episode of Supernatural on there. (I know

20) Some horses that I can borrow so I can pull a car in a corporate office building complex.


And so far that is all.  I know these are silly, then I will be more than happy to help even you can't help me. So if you want to help PLEASE pm me. I have 5 days to do this so let's be creative, bold, and absolutely ridiculous. I will make sure I will give credit on where it is due.

I think at this point our community has grown to a point that we can expect to have 50+ people at a party.  This is great but it makes it difficult for any private residence to have a suitable size or parking for a gathering of this size.  

My idea is to rent out a little used section of a club called Barbarella in Ybor.  It would have a full bar, room, and facilities.  

I already spoke to the manager but have not committed to anything yet.  I really wanted to find out what the level of interest was or if anyone else had a better suggestion.

Food would be potluck, a bar, a stage, and is an outdoor area with a partial roof.  Also, they will allow you in at 18 so you don't have to be 21+ for this place.

I lived in sarasota while younger and have visited tampa many times, but have a few questions first:

- Where are the good areas for independently owned

- If money were no issue

- How did you make friends if you did not grow up in the area? Are social sports leagues big in Tampa? 

Any other things I should know?

1)  No paid parking - meetup should be held in an area with free and plentiful parking.

2)  No age restrictions - Sports bar type places are fine

3)  Have a backup plan for inclement weather - If a meetup is held outside have a backup plan in place.  

4)  Organizer must include both a physical address

5)  Provide a confirmation of attendance post on the day of the meetup.  If you post a meetup and it is made official you are taking responsibility to be there.  If you cannot show up you must post it so that other arrangements can be made and a new organizer can be selected.  

6)  Provide a contact number for questions

7)  Requests for official meetups must be made to a mod at least 2 weeks before the meetup date.  This allows us time to approve the meetup and post it to the banner so that everyone can see it and plan.

Message me to have a meetup added to the banner.

I am writing in response to your vote on recent bills (H.R.1540 and S.1867) that allow you to keep certain portions of the newest NDAA secret from the public before its passing into law.

I have been disserviced by my state.

* Napkins/Paper Towels
* Plasticware (aka utensils)

* Veggies (for grilling or a veggie tray)
* Potato and/or macaroni salad
* Meats for grilling (if you have something special you want)

...if you could please comment below with what you can bring from the list above so we don't end up with 20 bags of ice or 10 bags of chips.

Before I invest the time (and money, looks like about $50 to reserve one with access to parking/restrooms/grill, ball field, horseshoe pit and volleyball) to do the research and pull this together...**are you all interested???**

As the public buys more fuel-efficient vehicles and markets for electric and hybrid cars continue to grow

Despite the growth

""The increase in the number of fuel-efficient vehicles has just exploded, they're trading in their vehicles that got say, 15 to 20 miles to the gallon, for vehicles that get anywhere from 20 to 50 miles per gallon now.""

The less gas pumped

One option gaining momentum is a mileage-based user fee. The more you drive

Such a proposal is sure to raise privacy concerns among drivers. Reichert said technology exists to help mitigate those concerns

Basically, in freely available spaces, such as parks, the library, coffee houses, and our own homes.  Anyone can teach a class on anything in which they have some interest or expertise.

I, so I've chosen to *facilitate* a few meet-ups, such as an Exquisite Corpse surrealist art group, and a book club (this month we are discussing Frankfurt's *On Bullshit*, and in coming months we'll be focusing on banned books).

We've got a great roster of classes, basic computer safety, belly dancing, photography, and a lot more.  And if you have something you'd like to share, you can teach a class. I personally have a wishlist of classes I'd like to take, especially beginner's guitar and anything involving cooking.

-------------------------------------------------------------

So I thought I would guage the interest of squeezing in another meetup before the end of the year.

The last two or three meetups have been on the Tampa side of the bay.

During the discussion of the last meetup it was requested that the next one be on the otherside of the bay. One problem...I live in Tampa and don't have a clue on where a good place is over on the other side of the water. So St. Pete Redditors...what suggestions do you have?

The Beerfest post reminded me to post CCB's other major event coming up on March 9th. 

At the brewery, at the brewery. CCB will roll out a ton of special kegs as well as sometimes extremely special kegs from other breweries (last year, they had a keg of Dark Lord, another extremely rare stout from Three Floyds. CCB will start releasing teaser links on their Facebook page in the coming weeks.

Additionally

Hunahpu is a big, and is coveted in the beer-nerd world. 

That said, depending on when you get there, etc - info is on the CCB page I'll link to), I'd give you the cash for it before the day ($20/bottle) plus buy you a beer or a few *on* the day. So, if you or a friend are going and want to surrender one of your allotted Hunahpus, or if you're going anyway for the home-brews and don't really *want* Hunahpu, but are willing to pick up a bottle or two for a geek like me

After a few hours I get a call from his insurance company and my insurance company to give my statement... Turns out the guy is accusing me of hitting him... So now I'm stuck with having to pay the $500 deductible to fix my car.  

I was looking at some traffic cameras and the one that is on 275 and Ashley that is pointed west would have surely (hopefully) caught the whole thing - if there is any way to get that footage and prove the guy hit me I would be forever greatfull and would spend my saved money buying you a beer!",self,t5_2r7ih,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1h7f9l/is_there_a_way_to_pull_archived_highway_traffic/

1343055589.0,x0noj,Room for rent in my townhouse!,,17,1,6,"Looking for roommate in my townhouse! Located in a gated community near Waters and Armenia in Tampa, full size washer and dryer

The gated community is VERY quiet and well known neighbors. I have never had a problem living here as a single woman for the past 3.5 years. I am looking for someone who is equally quiet, has a stable income and is respectful of my belongings.

Rent is $450 and includes water, so if you wanted to install cable, that is fine, but you would need to cover the cost of that on your own. I cannot afford cable. You would have your own bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is fully furnished, but if you would like to bring in your own things, that is fine, I can easily move my things out of the bedroom.

A little about me...I'm 28 years old, but does not get along with other animals, so I am saying no to animals. I'm sorry, I just don't want the hassle and added stress with bringing in another animal. I am r/trees friendly.

The townhouse is individually owned, not financial background check. You have the option to sign a month-to-month lease or sign for multiple months/years. Looking for someone short-term from now until October 31st as this is when my lease ends, but if everything works out, I would like to stay longer and re-sign another lease.

Please email to set up a time to see the place. I hope to hear from you soon. ",self,t5_2r7ih,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/x0noj/room_for_rent_in_my_townhouse/

Yeah, there's free (awesome) dartboards, and they have an outside section as well if it's nice out. I work that night, so I won't be getting there until 10-10:30, but if some of you would like to meet here or elsewhere earlier, post it in the comments or such. We will be at the Dirty Shame until midnight, and after that we will probably wander down to some other bar, let us know here and we can figure out a way to contact you to inform your of our whereabouts. Address is 1929 E. 7th Ave.


**Meet-up #3- Sunday

A non-bar meet-up was requested, and then run around and have fun. If you have any footballs, frisbees, bochee sets, lawn darts, BRING THEM! They have trails and such, so get out from behind your computers, and come have some fun in the Florida sun! Let's celebrate the fact that we can go outside in shorts and a t-shirts while our northern friends are shoveling snow and freezing! Send them pictures on facebook and make them jealous! Anyways

I snapped a quick picture of the car with the antique Minnesota license plates in the closed off parking lot (will post tonight when I get home from work).

None of the employees I talked to would say anything other than ""we're closed"". I then ask the woman standing there with the ""sound guy""...""so, this otherwise 24x7 restaurant is closed in the middle of the day and employees are running around here like chickens with their heads cut off"". She give me a sly grin as if she can't say anything and finally said, ""well you put that together pretty fast. Yes, we are here filming, that's why the parking lot and business are closed.""
