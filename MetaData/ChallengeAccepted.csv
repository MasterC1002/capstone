Wheeeeeelp, ""Secret of the Forest"")) for half of the time...I'd say getting 21 songs done in 20 days ain't bad.  Still not the kind of pace I would have wanted to accomplish the project in 40 days, but I'm not daunted by the overall program.  I *will* finish this.  You *will* see me play the entire blasted soundtrack.  And hopefully, assuming I can get a better camera to work with (and use the sound set-up I already have but couldn't sync up with the cameras I own)...when I'm done, I'll celebrate the projects' completion by live-streaming my playing the entire soundtrack in one go.  2.5 hours.  No skin off of my nose, I've been known to sit and play video game medleys for 4+ hours at a time; limiting myself to a singular game wouldn't be that hard.

I tried this once before– over the summer– with much greater success than I thought would be possible. Unfortunately

Here's what presumably makes my quest a little more unique: I'll be basing my goals on two key ideals– ""classy"" and ""Hufflepuff.""
The ""classy"" I think should be fairly self-explanatory, when Pottermore came out (yes, go ahead, laugh) I did a complete reread of the Harry Potter books and turned back to the house that I had always identified with, Hufflepuff. The qualities ascribed to it (""Just and Loyal,"" ""True and Unafraid of Toil"") fit in line perfectly with my goals.

So here I go

In these 26 days
• Get back into the shape I was a month ago where I could run the six flights of stairs and cross-campus to get between two classes without getting out of breath.

• Get up every (week)day at or before 6:00

• Have all work done by evening Friday

• Set aside at least 45 minutes a day to read (keeping track through goodreads).

• Practice cello for at least an hour each day.

• Style myself up a little more daringly with the help of /r/lesbianfashionadvice

• Make my lunch bento more interesting

• Have all college applications done

• Shower **every day**. No exceptions.

• Be more outgoing. Don't leave every social engagement thinking

• Keep track of all tasks better. Remember to write them down.

• Do daily 750 words.

• Manage my ADHD better.


Particularly given this last item

1322189181.0,moh9g,"Challenge Accepted: Dependent on Women's Validation No More- More Productivity, No Fapping, FREEING MYSELF",GodofPH,17,11

Me- 20/M

I have a problem: I am hopelessly dependent on the approval of women. I'm always

This mode of thought has a stranglehold on self esteem and feelings. I'll feel depressed when I see happy couples together at my college. When I meet a nice girl who seems interested in me, of course) even if we're not dating or anything close to it.  If a girl rejects me, it will destroy my self esteem for a short time.

Then there's all of the wasted time, or trying to impress a certain woman all day. It's so stressful. Then comes the pickup artist material. I was naturally drawn to this because it promised to help me do better with women, but it makes me overthink interactions with women *even more.* Not to mention I've started acting differently than I normally do around women because of tips the material may give, so women are getting to know someone who isn't really me. I have nothing against the PUA community though- there's a lot of great stuff on not just improving relations with women, but social skills and life improvement in general. I've just had problems interpreting it wrongly and using the wrong techniques on wrong situations.

Possibly the worst thing is that it's twisted my perception of women. I'm so hellbent on getting a relationship that I constantly misinterpret a girl's actions. I oversimplify things- I've come to viewing them as either bitches, or the small dateable margin. That's a gross, gross generalization. I seem to have forgotten that women are, you know, flawed, imperfect people who have their own wants, needs, problems

**But no more.**

In the past I've tried to bury myself in other things

**1- Remove Temptation to Overthink**
The first thing I did was unsubscribe from r/seduction and r/dating_advice. These are both extremely helpful subreddits for those who use them right, but usually leads to stress or disappointment when it doesn't work out the way I planned. I may very well return to the PUA community in the future, but for now, it's best to stay away. Besides, GetMotivated and Fitness give me so much better self improvement material!

**2- Productivity!**
I've lost too much time and brain power to this search for women's approval in the past. All of that lost productivity, self esteem building achievements. I've even ironed out a list of things I can do just to remind myself there *are* things I can focus on instead.

* Learn Maya
* Learn to play notes on guitar (mostly just know chords)
* Develop (and write) the screenplay I've been tinkering with
* Read the works of Edgar Allan Poe (I share a birthday with the man and love the stuff I've read so far)
* Pitch my graphic novel project to more companies (I spent most of the summer developing the pitch
* Finish watching Soul Eater (I started this anime around the beginning of the semester
* Finish Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey (stuck on the final boss since summer before I lost interest- but Mem Aleph's days are numbered)
* Fill out more job applications
* Develop a more cohesive diet (I want to cut fat but still build muscle. I need to diet accordingly)
…and so on.

**3- Focus on Understanding Women**
All people are complex individuals. Everyone has their own feelings, and less likely to be bitter over their actions, and B) Actually make some female *friends*. Not every interaction with a woman *has* to be romantic or sexual. And we can all use more friends, right?

**4- Positivity!**
Self explanatory

**5- Stop. Fapping.**
One of the goals had to be inappropriate for dinner conversation, and leave it at that. I stopped by r/StopFap today, and read about some of the affects of porn addiction- decreased drive for social interaction, decreased libido, etc. Plus, it would just make me feel terrible at times. I've read many stories about guys who broke their porn/fap addictions and experienced less social anxiety and more confidence- even if they weren't getting laid all the time. So I've started the process, just deleted my porn stash on my comp. Not just put in the Trash, though.

Those 5 areas sound like great places to start. I'm not trying

TL;DR: Completely dependent on women for validation in my life- changing that.

You're invited
- no pessimism or ""healthy skepticism"" is allowed
- upon accepting this challenge you are confirming that you believe it is possible
- we shall form a mastermind group and check in with each other regularly to see how progress is going
- we'll celebrate heartily once we've achieved!

Furthermore:
- the logical question to ask is ""how?"" how will we go about making this ten grand? It's certainly up to you: you can earn money however it suits you.
- However at the same time
- Deliberate attention and strong good feelings are all that are required to bring all good things into our lives
- The most important aspect will be focusing on the ten grand regularly
- This is sort of an act of faith (although the word can be sometimes annoying to hear)... but faith will be the lubricant that will make this happen.
- Stranger things have happened to people than suddenly earning $10
- And it's also not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. To the universe
