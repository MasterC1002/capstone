While we could have easily gotten the referrer data from the call we opted to just get the domain. Why? We are using that data to run regression code for the cases where smoothgestures runs poorly.

We're not trying to be dicks here

I also have another plugin called Troll Emoticons that had the same code for about 3 weeks now so we didnt really think it was a problem.
I am going this AMA about the subject, something that the chrome webstore lacks. 

An updated build going back to the way things worked has been submitted to google and it is awaiting their review.

While we're waiting to get the update back in the store and would love to get your feedback.

    +++++++++++++++++++++++++
    Changelog and feature set for the next update
    * 1.7% more awesome
    * 97.3% Less ""spy-ee""

For the curious - I just posted a gist of what was going on serverside.

* OS: All desktop PCs running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
* Extensions: Checker Plus for Gmail, IBA Opt-out, LastPass, Reddit Enhancement Suite and Xmarks.

* The issues have even came about after a clean install of Windows; however, if not a week or two even with all extensions being used. My guess is it began acting up again after an update.",,False,self,t5_2qlz9,1358365964.0,,

First let me lay some groundwork:

* I live in the SF bay area

* I'm a cs major and so I do a **LOT** on my computer

* I didn't buy it as a PC replacement

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**SAMSUNG CHROMEBOOK PROS/CONS**

Now that I have that out of the way let me tell you about the bad stuff first. 

**CONS**

* Chicklet style keys are not backlit

* the apple copycat touchpad only has buttons on the bottom

* there is no caps lock button

* power button is right above backspace

* the speakers suck total ass

* no function buttons. Again

* 16 gb ssd (not a problem for me because I picked up a 1.5 TB external for $80)

* limited apps 


**PROS**

* light as fuck

* screen is actually pretty bright

* Quickest boot I've ever had

* battery charges quickly and lasts a good amount of time

* I'm personally a google fan and have a nexus tablet and galaxy nexus phone

* although they're not backlit the keys feel pretty sturdy when pressed and aren't worthless clicky things like some that I've had.

* 4g network compatible (I havent bought the data plan for it yet

* did I mention it was light?

* less than 5 minute setup if you already have a google account.

* *google drive is a great portable office suite

* *the remote desktop app is a great

* *great Wi-Fi range. I can sit outside of the CompSci building on a nice day and still have full connectivity. (also partly the fact that we have pretty good wireless routers at my school)


________________________________________________
**CHROME-OS PROS/CONS**

Although the newest addition to the list of operating systems I feel that Google did an amazing job at getting something that was fast

**CONS**

* Always working in a browser feels pretty confining even though it really isn't

* not much to customize *(this can be seen as a Pro as well)* 

* it's a web based OS

* will **NOT** replace your mac/pc for any type of graphics editing. Not only are most of the models incapable of running such ram/cpu intensive programs; but you're stuck with web based knock-offs of programs like photoshop

* **EDIT* I've found a pretty good photoshop replacement. It's a ""full featured"" photo editing app


**PROS**

* again the fastest booting OS I've ever had

* this one's more personal prefenrence; but I love the rudimentary styling of the Files app. It makes it hard to get lost in a plethora of folders and it helps me stay focused on the task at hand instead of dicking around with settings and formatting and stuff like that.

* most apps aren't at all CPU intensive so multiple windows hasn't been a problem for me (after adding 2gb virtual RAM from the SSD)

____________________________________________________________________________________________
I'll keep this thread updated as I find more pros/cons (will be notated with an extra asterisk. and I'll submit a conclusion when I've spent more time using it. And Please feel free to add any pros or cons to the comments so I can put them up here.

^I'm ^using ^my ^chromebook ^right ^now ^to ^write ^this



*I also plan to add another thread just for all the tips and tricks to use

special thanks to spif and DoctorBurger for helping me out with those.

There have been a bunch of changes that I see so far:

* Notifications Icon in Windows Notification Area

* The new tab page has changed. It now shows a Google search box in the middle and 4 of your most visited websites under it instead of 8. Broken because you cant middle click these to open them in a new tab. If you have a theme instead

* When typing in the omnibar, but the 'Google black bar' that ran across the top doesn't show, making it harder to access Google services like mail and calender.

* The new tab page has a apps button but looks like it doesn't work yet either. 

* Looks like they are relocating the recent tabs that was in the new tab page to your 'menu button' the three bar button that they use in Android.

I'm sure there's more. Keep updated.

Although the new look is indeed more ""catchy""


= 1) Search | I don't know if you tried recently to search for something in the new webstore

For instance, ""Plants vs Zombies"", ""Turn Off the Lights"". Clearly, the algorithm puts largely too much weight on the popularity or the number of users of an extension/app.

Now, I developed an extension for Gmail called ""Ad Remover and Better UI for Gmail"". Here, again the first result is irrelevant ""MusicSig vkontakte""!! Why the latter extension appears in first position: (i) popular (&gt;100'000 users) (ii)the words ""removing ads"" appear in its description. So, the new webstore algorithm seems to parse and take into account more than before the description of addons and extensions. Again, the weight of the parameter ""description"" should be far less than the one put on the ""name"" of the extension/app to avoid this kind of issues.


= 2) Navigation | The new first page uses tiles to present extensions/apps to the user. Basic information available at first glance are the name of the app/extension and number of stars. While it's good to attach the [1-5] stars-scale to indicate the ""quality"" of an extension/app


= 3) Screenshots | When you publish an extension in the new webstore, ie 640x400px [4]. Why don't include a kind of lightbox functionality making possible for the user to click on a screenshot to enlarge it?

What do you think of the new webstore? Do you have any insights on the new search algorithm they put in place?

* The [Acid3](http://acid3.acidtests.org/) test hangs at 98/100 for me in a normal window (Mac OSX, YMMV).  Running this test in an Incognito Window will make it to 100/100 with one error—""You should not see this at all"" is rendered in the top left corner.  If you are experiencing problems viewing a website, try it in an Incognito Window to resolve some of these issues.

* Extensions are disabled in a convenient way.  Rather than adding a site to your adblock white-list, open it in an Incognito Window.  This is particularly helpful if the site in question is one that you don't go to very often and a permanent fix is unnecessary.

* Quickly log in to secondary accounts.  If you're like me and have no-spam accounts for email, you can use the Incognito Window to access these accounts without logging out of your main account.

Experimental WebKit Features It's controlled by a switch called switches::kEnableExperimentalWebKitFeatures . And there are currently two files that make use of the switch: content/renderer/render_thread_impl.cc and content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc

http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/content/renderer/render_thread_impl.cc
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc

Do a find in page with ""kEnableExperimentalWebKitFeatures"" and voila. Here are the features that are currently in experimental stage and can be tested with the runtime flag on:

* Scoped Stylesheets
* Custom DOM Elements
* Experimental Content Security Policy
* HTML &lt;dialog&gt; Element
* HTML &lt;iframe seamless&gt; Attribute
* CSS Regions
* CSS Exclusions
* CSS Grid Layout
* CSS Sticky Positioning (position: -webkit-sticky)
* CSS Variables

Experimental JavaScript Features can be enabled by launching Chrome with the --harmony command-line flag.

Chrome uses V8

https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/src/flag-definitions.h#133

The custom search feature (go to preferences, will search for the remaining input on that site via a URL you provide.  For example: I've got reddit in there, with the keyword set to 'reddit', and url 'http://www.reddit.com/search?q=%s' . This lets me type ""reddit "" (notice the space) then whatever I want into the address bar, and it will search using reddits own search.  This list is automatically populated as you visit sites, but the keywords are usually the full domain name and never get used.


You can also use this same window to implement non-search keywords. If you dont include a %s in the URL


The only caveat is that you can't have search keywords and regular keywords be the same, 'so' and 'sso', etc.

The real reasons though

I know that Firefox has a Sync feature, on any platform, on any media, and I'll be a short sign-in away from my customized browser with all of my bookmarks and extensions intact. If I'm wrong, and Firefox does have a feature like this that I am unaware of, please let me know and I'll be happy to take this back.

I currently do now own a cell phone, I only have to have a dedicated tab open for it if I'm going to make or receive a call. If all I want to do is text, all I have to do is use the little icon on my toolbar. It also notifies me if I have missed calls or voicemails. So if I do miss a call, a little notification pops up and I know I need to open the webapp and check it.

If one day I get a cell phone, and it will ring my cell phone and then make my call for me. It's really quite the useful addon.
