1334262532.0,s6qmp,Fix-A-Flat: A firsthand account,azulhombre,76,10,65,"Okay

Before we get started

As an employee of these companies, nor did I try selling him anything else he didn't need, and if the tires were not purchased at my store or I couldn't get a matching tire for the customer, I would send them somewhere they could get a match, be it Les Schwab, Discount Tire, etc.  My honesty was something that I never gave up in my employment with these establishments.

The advantages of Fix-A-Flat are that it comes in handy in a pinch and it's convenient.  A product that can fix a small puncture AND reinflate your tire?  Fantastic.  There are many situations in which this could save much time and diffuse frustration.  That is about all the good I have to say about this product

The disadvantages of this product, but that is not the case.  Fix-A-Flat will roll around in your tire and sometimes never escape it.  Because of this, it comes in contact with the entire inner lining of the tire, which in turn breaks down the rubber and weakens the tire.

Possibly the worst aspect of this issue is that it weakens the sidewall, you know that most shops will not repair a tire if there is a puncture on the sidewall or on the shoulder of the tire.  This is because when you drive, your tires flex and bend, and there has yet to be made a patch or plug that can contour with all of that movement and retain a seal.  Sidewalls on most tires, unless specifically noted, don't have much reinforcement so they need all they can get.

Another disadvantage of Fix-A-Flat is that since it is a water-based product, it never escapes unless you break the tire off the rim and clean it out, then putting it back on, which some shops will do very hesitantly.  Not only does it cause a terrible mess, but it jeopardizes the integrity of the tire.  Sometimes the only way you can get a shop to do this for you is if you express that you understand the concerns and have them notate that you were advised of the risks on the work order, which both you and the store then have a copy of (example: Customer was notified of the dangers of this product; requested work be performed anyway).

One more issue with this product is that since it just rolls around in the tire with no real rhyme or reason to it, causing the tire to be heavier/thicker in some areas and lighter/thinner than others.  This results in making the tire very difficult and sometimes impossible to rebalance.

Now if you go and look for reviews of this product, they do all the work themselves and never have to rely on a mechanic or tire shop to do the work for them.  Since not everyone has a tire machine and balancer in their garage, I believe it is necessary that everyone should be aware of these potential risks of using Fix-A-Flat.  And just to be clear, I don't work for some company hell bent on creating a smear campaign against Fix-A-Flat, I'm just an honest guy attempting to share his firsthand knowledge and experience with this product to potentially save people from a very expensive bill in the future.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

**Identify your vehicle**  
The *minimum* information that you should relay to us is the year, engine size, relevant options.  You will have to use your best judgement on what options are relevant.  Remember, it's always better to provide too much vehicle information than not enough.  Options that are helpful to know are transmission type (auto, manual), 4x4 vs 2x4, any aftermarket tomfoolery, and any recent work that has been done.  Again
  
**Vehicle won't start**  
  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, but doesn't start""  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, you should say ""The vehicle cranks and starts, but won't run""  
* If the starter spins the engine
* If the starter does not spin the engine
  
**Noises**  
  
When your vehicle makes odd noises try to tell us as much as possible about not only the noise, and what options are turned on.  Try to classify the noise that it's making, rather than just saying ""it's making noise.""
  
* Squeaks and Squeals: Usually a shrill,"" ""my belt on the front of my engine squeaks when the A/C is on, but only when it's raining out.""  As always, more information is good.  
* Grinding nosies:  That noise you hear when metal is rubbing against metal.  I've heard it described a plethora of ways.  Once you've heard it you will be able to identify it everywhere.  Tell us when and where you hear it.  If it's coming from your brakes then STOP DRIVING THAT CAR until you find out where it's coming from.  
* Clunking and thumping:  Clunking noises in the suspension sound like someone tapping a part with a hammer.  Sometimes it sounds like they are tapping it gently
  
**Driveability**  
  
This is the part that I'm sure people will disagree with me on
* If the vehicle seems to be running fine
* If the vehicle is jerking, or the engine is bouncing around like a [cat in an automatic catwash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyi8ly5dRkU) then tell us when it happens.  Is it only when you're going up a steep hill?  At night with the headlights on?  In traffic?  In the rain?  All of this information helps us figure out whats up.  
* If the vehicle starts, for the love of FSM don't say it ""won't turn over.""  Tell us it starts, and then dies.  Then tell us how it dies.  Does it idle for a couple seconds then die?  Can you feather the accelerator and keep it running?  Does it die when you put it in gear?  Information is key.  
  
**The Check Engine Lamp**  
  
We need to know why this light is on, drive the vehicle until the light comes back on, and have them read again, and tell us all of the original codes and the codes that came back.  The codes will be in a very specific format, such are ""p0300 Random cylinder misfire"" or ""p0305 Cylinder 5 misfire"" or ""p0420 Catalytic converter efficiency below threshold.""

* Check your lights. Brake lights, you get the idea.

Underhood:

*  With the engine cold take off your radiator cap and check the fluid level. If it's nasty in there go ahead and flush out your cooling system. Top off as necessary.

*  Check brake fluid level

* Use a flash light and inspect your drive belts for cracks. If it is cracked

* Look around for oil leaking near your valve cover(s). If you see leaks a valve cover gasket is an easy, 3600, 3800 look in the valey on both ends of the motor for coolant leaking. They leak all the time from the intake gaskets)

* Check your power steering reservoir. If the fluid is low

* Check trans fluid

* Pull off your PCV valve and shake it. it should rattle a little. If it doesn't make any noise

* Check your air filter and if you are feeling so inclined pull of the tubing to the throttlebody and peak into the intake. If it's nasty try some seafoam treatment to clean up the gunk.

* Inspect your battery terminals for corrosion. This is cleaned with a baking soda water mixture. Then rinse off with more water. There is a special paint that can be sprayed on the terminals to protect from future corrosion if that interests you.

* Using a flashlight look for any motor mounts on the upper part of the engine bay. Check for tearing and replace any that are torn through or almost torn through. as soon as one mount goes

Wheel area:

* Check balljoints and tierods. On most cars jack the front end of the car up using the frame or pinchweld of the car. Hold the tire at 3 and 9 o'clock. shake side to side. a loose tierod will be light feeling. If you start to really shake the wheel back and forth you are going to feel some play from the steering rack. Just a gentle side to side shake. A loose tierod will be obvious

* Truck/SUV ball joints are checked differently. (the way these are checked are more dependent on the suspension setup. A good rule of thumb is that if the spring is attached to the lower control arm check them with this method). Jack the front suspension up by putting the jack under the control arm. Then use a prybar and pry up on the bottom of the tire. If the wheel moves

* Pull off one of your front wheels and peak at your brake pads. IF they are less than 2/32nds of an inch thick, you need to replace them.

* Pull a rear wheel and repeat the brake inspection in the back. If you have drums

* On drums check the shoe thickness. under 1/32nd of an inch and you need to replace them (if there are rivets on the shoe

* Check the tread pattern on all your tires. If they are at the wear bars (little raised pieces inbetween the treads) you need tires. If you have jagged edges you are having a toe issue. If you have excessive wear on one edge you may also have a toe issue. If you have a cupping pattern on the inside edge of the tire you need shocks. 

* Look for oil leaking from your shocks. You don't want oil leaking from your shocks.

Undercar:

* Do all that safe stuff so you don't kill yourself in your driveway

* Look at all of your suspension bushings. The little rubber pieces that are in all of the suspension connections. If you find some rotted out or torn badly. They need replacement. (90's Civics

* Look for oil leaks

* Check your exhaust for leaks and rusted hangers.

When I got back I noticed at low speed I heard a creaking/knocking sound coming from my left front wheel. I've had this problem [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/Autos/comments/gokkd/creaking_noise_under_light_braking/) and figured it was my brake pads rubbing the rotor a little bit.

My internet research yielded the same results as the last time I had this problem, cv joints, stuck caliper, poor quality brake pads, differentials... but this time I saw loose lug nuts. 

I check my wheel. 3 of the five lug nuts are loose to the point I could take them off by hand. They jiggled when I shook them. I was floored. 

I tighten them down and the noise is completely gone. 

I guess from this experience I've taken that I should always double check my lug nuts after any mechanic work that involves taking off the wheels. I'm also considering buying an inexpensive torque wrench and torquing them to spec myself.

And to others I recommend that if you have weird noises coming from the wheel area check those lug nuts! Don't make my stupid mistake.

1328550643.0,pdee1,How (not) to use DTCs (check engine codes) to diagnose problems,TrouserPudding,56,16,28,"I see a lot of misunderstanding of what it means when your ""check engine light"" (MIL: Malfunction indicator Lamp) is on and what the ""codes"" (DTC: Diagnostic Trouble Codes) mean.  Let's discuss this a bit in general terms that apply to most vehicles and situations.  As with everything

First of all, time when certain conditions such as speed or engine temp are met, or number of cold start cycles - for misfires it's typically just regular time) a pending DTC is stored.  If the event does not reoccur, the counter is cleared or decremented based on rules very similar to those that would increment the counter.  Should the counter reach a predetermined threshold a hard DTC will be set and your MIL will illuminate.  Specifically for misfires (and no other common DTC that I am aware of) this counter has a third threshold that when reached will flash the MIL.  This is a special situation for misfires that happens to tell you to STOP DRIVIG NOW because you are dumping enough raw fuel into your exhaust that it could cause catalytic converter damage.

Now, little room for interpertation, and little room for error.  Or is there?  What if the other cylinders on that bank are also misfiring but haven't reached a threshold to set a DTC?  That certainly changes the possible cause of this symptom from a single plug/wire/COP/compression/injector issue to something effecting an entire bank or the whole motor.  So how do you know what's going on?  Live data and logging.  You can see all of those counters as well as the DTCs with a laptop, some free software, and a $20 OBDII to USB cable off of eBay.

This is the part where I tell you about DTCs in general

So the guy at AutoZone read the codes for you and it said P0420 Catalyst Inefficient and he told you that means your catalytic converter is dead.  Seems simple enough

P0420=replace cat.  How can it mean anything else?  Well, all ECUs, and good fuel) it really is that simple....the cat is bad.  But you really don't know that those other conditions have been met.  Chances are good they have not.  The first problem here is that O2 sensors age or get damaged in ways that the ECU hasn't yet met a criteria to call them ""bad"" and set an appropriate DTC.  There is a DTC dependency tree that makes a lot of sense but can be quite complicated.  An easy one that is applicable to this example is that you will NEVER get a P0420 if you have one of several codes indicating a problem with the upstream or downstream O2 sensor on that bank because it is rightly assumed that if either O2 sensor is bad, any extrapolated data from it will be bad as well.  This is why you can have a code indicating your upstream O2 is bad, replace it and clear that code, only to have a P0420 come up later: it was simply impossible for the P0420 to be set while the upstream was considered non or low-functioning.

More reasons you can't accept this P0420 diagnosis: you engine coolant temperature sensor could be faulty.  But that should set a DTC also, incorrect or damaged spark plugs, etc the timing is going to get ""pulled"" by the ECU.  The fact that the ECU is doing this should preempt the P0420 code, but this won't always be the case, as the time overlap may not be great enough.  And, let's face it, this is software.  It's imperfect and you aren't exactly running Windows Update on it once a week.  Things just don't get fixed and mechanics who are familiar with your particular model car/ECU will probably be aware of these types of issues.  Now onto another one: exhaust leak.  If you have a leak in front of your upstream sensor if just might cause a P0420.  Conversely

So here we are with what seems like a pretty simple DTC to diagnosis, what and where the sensors read, and how an ECU interprets and uses that data to be of any diagnostic value to you.

This is why the articles of late in regards to [""Ban the Check Engine Light""](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/01/ban-check-engine-lights/) are both short sighted and ignore the larger issue: DTCs are _NOT_ diagnoses.  They are often little better than vague pointers to a specific line of troubleshooting.  Improving the ""accuracy"" of these indicators

So there you have it.  Even though we have these wonderful data gathering devices in every car made past 1997 or so you still need someone who knows what they mean, as certain DTCs tend to correspond with certain known problems that are make/model specific.

turning over - the starter is engaging the flywheel and turning the motor.  This is what happens when your car is working properly between the time when you turn the key to start and right before it actually starts firing and runs on its own.  It has nothing to do with if the car starts to run on its own or not.  Just that the starter motor is turning the engine.

cranking - see ""turning over"".  These are synonyms.

firing - the engine actually runs on its own power.

""crank no start"" or ""no crank no start""

/r/cartalk is a great place with many regular posters from a wide variety of backgrounds ranging from professional mechanics to guys who have restored entire cars in their garage. Have a question about your car? Post away - someone here can probably help you. Have an answer or just a good tip? Please share.

In order to keep it from getting junked up with typical automotive forum garbage and to keep a viable car repair resource the following **rules** will be followed:

1.) **This is a car repair subreddit**. It is not for car reviews

2.) **Be specific**. ""MY WHITE CAR IS CLUNKING WHEN IT GOES WHAT COULD IT BE?"" is not going to get you anywhere. We need to know what make, we need to know that, as well as why. Use a code reader to get the code(s) and post the numbers (they will usually look like P&lt; 4_digits &gt;). If you don't have a code reader, most parts stores will read them for free.
Also

3.) **No car audio threads**. There is a reason why /r/caraudio was killed. We have no interest in repeating that here. If you have a question about your stock system malfunctioning

4.) **No car recommendation threads**. ""What's a good car for under $x?"" posts and the like will be deleted. Most are posted by people who have not bothered to do their own research first, telling you that spending $100 on a pre purchase inspection is the only way to go, or telling you why financing through the dealer at 14% with $1000 down is a bad idea.

1341676435.0,w6j16,"As there seem to be a LOT of Cranking No-Start (Turn key, engine spins, no start) Threads on here I wanted to create a little diagnostic reference for people to start with.",projektnitemare13,36,13

Ok

For a standard internal combustion engine to work it needs four main things.  Fuel, there are other thigns that can be wrong, but from my time working on cars, this will apply to 90% of cranking no starts.  AKA, you turn the key, the engine spins over but will not start.  And here are some basic tests to check for function.  I will include a set of tests for those who have some basic tools and for those without.  

The diagnostic tool kit (and absolutely necessary for those who want to work on cars)

1. Digital Multi Meter:  You can get these just about anywhere

2.  Spark Tester:  These can be gotten at just about any parts store or online

3.  Fuel Pressure/Flow Tester:  Here we get into a little more specialized equipment, if you have a diesel or direct injected engine any other method may be unsafe.)

4.  Timing Light:  With modern computer controlled engines

Onto the testing, the last thing you want to do is just start throwing parts at this as it can get expensive and terrible very quickly.  But with some directed diagnostics you can save yourself a lot of time (and money.)

EDIT (thank you to derphurr):  One thing to add on, if you dont have at the bare minimum ~11.5V you will need to recharge your battery before doing anything else (most batteries range from 12.5-13.5V before applying a load to them) many cars wont even function at this level, but I have one car that will still start all the way down at 10.8V so I wont say they all stop functioning below 11.5, but as a rule of thumb I will either recharge it, or at least know that there may be some inherent issues with further testing.


* Spark:  This is usually the easiest to check and the most likely to be your problem.  
   
   1.  Visually inspect the system

   2.  Check for spark, you then attach it to a ground and crank the engine and check to see if you get a nice electrical arc.  If you do, its most likely not an ignition problem.  If you have no spark, move to the next step.
   
   3.  If your car has a distributor, then you are looking at a bad cap and rotor.  If there is still no spark there then we can address specific cars.  If you have no distributor, just check from coil to plug for spark and if no spark, then once again, its a case by case.

   4.  If you have made it to the coil


* Air:  The inlet side of this is easy to check
    
  1.  Look and make sure there are no kinks crimps or opens on the intake side of the engine.  should be kind of obvious if there are, if these get gooped up badly enough it will not flow enough to allow the engine to do its thing.
 
  2.  Check under the car, this isn't helpful either.  if you see these, they might be your problem.

* Fuel:  Here it gets a little trickier, some are higher some are lower, you'll have to check your car's spec.  Also, the manner you hook these up is a little different from vehicle to vehicle, some are a schraeder valve on the rail, others you have to remove a bolt and thread in there you'll have to look on the web and find out how you are supposed to do it.

* Timing/Compression:  This is the hardest, and sadly it is completely dependent on your particular car and engine combo.  this is one of those that will require some time and familiarity to really be ale to check, so hopefully you can do the others first, and really unless you break a timing belt, your timing should never naturally come so far out that it cant run, it may run like crap but it should still run if you skip a tooth or two.

So that was how you do it with the proper tools. 

* Spark

* Fuel:  For systems with a little valve:  get a rag and use a small flat head screw driver to simply press on the valve it should squirt out fuel

* Air: well thats kind of a visual thing anyways.

* Timing: very likely its not happening without tools unless you have external timing marks

Well, but jsut wanted to post this to hopefully help out those looking for assistance, also any ways I can improve this or make it more understandable, please let me know.

I know that post is over a month old

There was a lot of junk in the bottom of the float bowls as well as the jet seats. The choke was stuck on the front carb, but the upper taper tended to get stuck. 

I should also note that the front carb is the one that has been giving me the most issues in the past. I have to keep the mixture nut very rich (in comparison to the rear carb) in order for the car to idle and rev smooth.  

I took my time cleaning them, I simply moved it up in the piston housing by a 1/16th of an inch to give it clearance and richen the mixture. I gave the linkages a quick spray of silicone lubricant to assist with the choke and throttle operation.

I pulled the distributor cap and inspected the insides for damage or wear. There was some ashy buildup on the contact points on the inside of the cap

The car started right up after initial adjustments were made to the mixture. No stuttering when cold as well. Continued with minimal adjustments after the car fully warmed up. I took the car for a quick drive up to 45 mph with no issues

Thank you to Caedus_Vao for pointing me in the correct direction to resolve the issue!

This story ends with my van. Before you ask, almost windowless van. The main issue I have right now is a sort of ""clunk"" which I believe is coming from the transmission.

The infamous clunk occurs to a lesser extent when accelerating rapidly, sometimes pulsing, although it's difficult to tell if the power pulsing corresponds with the clunking, because by that point in time, I'm in ""Oh shit, I'm about to stop, accelerator to the floor, 30 going up!""

The van does leak some fluids, and stayed at the same level, but when I checked yesterday, it was two pints short, which had to have leaked in the past month or two. I only had one pint of tranny fluid on hand, so I poured that in, and it didn't alleviate the clunking whatsoever. 

That's all I can think of

Oh, here's a laundry list of all the (known) problems:

* The right reverse light is spotty. Sometimes it stops working

* One of the door stopper hinges (which prevents the door from swinging out too wide, if I knew how to weld.

* The gas intake is finicky, repeat. No idea what this is.

* The cabin lights don't work. Probably burned out bulb

* The top rear hinge on the sliding door is weak, I'll deal with a temperamental door.

* The ignition is hard to engage at first, it becomes easier. No idea, minor complaint.

* The engine occasionally sputters out, not sure what the root cause is.

* The transmission makes a whiny noise in first gear. Apparently it's done this for years

* The water pump whines a ton. I was going to replace the pump when I replaced the thermostat

* The power brakes occasionally fail. This sounds like a major issue, I'll have to check it out one day.

* The locks are too much of a pain to close, and leave a wookie sitting in the driver's seat, half-eaten waffle in mouth. This is kind of bothersome, but makes my day every time.

And that's all I can think of at the moment

tl;dr: I drive a death trap.

However, they took the tire off the rim, sprayed some soapy solution all over and couldn't find any leaks.

I was pretty stumped so I got a friend of mine who works on cars to take a look. He shined a light down into the cylinder head and saw a pretty sizable crack. I had him run an estimate for the repair - he wants $1200 for parts and labor and apparently this is a good deal.

I'm done with this car and just want to get rid of it. I'm not sure if I should pay my friend to fix it and then try to sell it, the gauges don't work, there are some scratches on the hood and a little rust on the hub caps.

1334351539.0,s8ju3,A/C PSA for Friday the 13th.,Dirty_Old_Town,22,6,7,"So, so they recovered the refrigerant

Here's where the PSA part comes into play.

The student thought the vehicle had rear A/C - it didn't. Because he thought it had rear A/C, I've never seen one so overcharged and I figured if the pressure got too high the pressure switch would cut the compressor clutch off, or at worst the relief valve would vent the excessive pressure. I've seen both happen before. Today, however, I was wrong on both counts. Once he started the vehicle and turned on the A/C, it ran for about three seconds before one of the lines to the condenser ruptured. It was louder than an airbag deployment, and the entire shop was cloudy from all the refrigerant and oil. No one was hurt (safety glasses!), but in my mind all I could think about was Jeff Spicoli saying ""Awesome! Totally awesome!"" Remember that scene at the end of Blues Brothers where the Dodge throws a rod and Elwood has to clean the windshield with his sleeve? That's how much oil and dye was all over the windshield of this thing. The moral of the story is that if you're working on the A/C system of a vehicle that may or may not have rear A/C

I am not a mechanic. I fix my car when it breaks

Also, and edit anything from this. I'm not promising it's 100% correct.


**How to check if fuel pump is dead**

 - Make sure it’s not out of fuel

 - Check if you can hear the Fuel Pump by Removing gas cap and put ear up to it

       - If you CAN hear the fuel pump

 - Is the Fuse blown?

       - If It’s good

 - Is the Relay working?

       - You should be able to put a finger on the relay and feel it click on when the key is cycled

       - You should also be able to hear the relay click on when the key is cycled

       - If the relay is not clicking

       - If the new relay is not clicking

       - Test this by using a voltage detector on each female plug where the relay plugs in..Please read into this! You don't want to over-extend the female sockets, move onto the next step.

 - If everything still is working

      - If the gauge reads 0 when trying to start the car

      - If there is a reading

      - A reading and spikes means the pump is pumping. You probably don't need to go on

 - At the gastank, sparks and fuel are not good!

 - If 1-6 is good

 - Once you get to the pump, after this much work, it might be worth it to just put a new pump in!

So last time I got my oil changed, they got Hercules to screw that shit on there, and there's no way I can get it off. The filter for some reason was slightly too large for my usual oil filter wrench (the kind that's like a really large driver that attaches to a socket wrench), so I used a strap wrench, which successfully crushed the thin body of the filter. So then I decided to just go out and buy a traditional oil filter wrench, the inch-wide-band-of-metal kind, but I can't get purchase because the thing is crushed. Then I remembered an old gearhead friend of mine that once punctured all the way through a filter with a screwdriver and that allowed him to get the purchase and leverage necessary. So I did that

So i guess now my options are to go to the hardware store and get a really long screwdriver for more leverage, and have them fix my problem for me. But I really don't like that option. Any suggestions?

Please remember to include this information as a bare minimum, drivetrain, etc).

It's good to be able to say ""My 1991 Nissan Pathfinder is having charging issues""

**Why does this specific information matter?**

Well, a variety of different parts. For instance, I have a 1987 Volvo 760. The 760 came with two radically different engines. One was a 2.7L naturally aspirated PRV V6, the other was a 2.3L Turbocharged 4cyl. *Literally none of the engine parts are compatible, including stuff like the alternator and AC compressor*. In addition, the wiring is completely different for those two motors even though the rest of the car (suspension, body panels, etc) is the same.

**Don't forget to include modifications!**

Though not always installed by the person who's driving the car, my '85 Volvo 240 has an upgraded alternator, taken from a '94 Volvo 940T. The stock 240 Alt puts out 55A and is made by Bosch. The upgraded alt puts out ~110A and is made by Nippondenso. This is a relatively minor modification, but if your car is for instance, turbocharged, and it wasn't from the factory, that's a good thing to know.

In one place it's stated to replace every 120,000 miles.  In yet another, that it protects for up to 120,000 miles.  


These qualifiers make these statements vague.  Why?


If it really protects to 120,000 for different applications or because it might be used by consumers after some wear and damage was already done and so more frequent changing is required?

If it really protects to 60,000 to suggest that the vehicle needs little maintenance, foregoing the protection and life of the cooling system?

Is there something else at play here

Three days ago it threw the code P0942 and went into limp mode only allowing me to go 20mph.

Well it did it again yesterday leaving me stranded with my son until it went away ten minutes later only this time the check engine light wont seem to turn off after I clear the code. After some research I found the follwing about this code:

""The p0942 code happens when it sees the malfunction in the hydraulic pressure unit control. The malfunction may not happen right away, you may be able to drive for a while before it retrips the code, all depends on how bad the failure is at this point""

I don’t know if it’s relevant but my car is pretty messed up.  I have random misfires on different cylinders, crazy that I’ve been abusing my poor car for so long, but I took it back to them immediately after the symptoms and to several other mechanics after the symptoms started and have spent a boat load of money fixing approximately nothing.  The place that did the timing belt told me it was the brakes…  The next place said it was the battery.. The next place the alternator… The next place said I needed transmission service..  The next place said it was that I needed to replace my head gaskets and CV axles – I said fuck it at this point and did some research on my own knowing approximately fuckall about cars.  I thought it might be the plugs/cables/coil pack.  I’ve replaced all those on my own but the symptoms remain.  I think it must be the timing belt is off by like a notch but it’s 3 years after the shop made (what I assume) is that mistake, so I can’t imagine they’ll fix it for free – and it’s a really expensive job for a poor person like myself.  This is a pretty long winded way to say I believe I have a timing problem, and would that make me fail my emissions test?  And can I trick it into passing until I can afford fixing the timing belt again?

Day 2 started out poorly:

1) I had the runs.  Excuse the term

2) go to breakfast @ Sonic and they messed up my order.  So I had no food aside from the 1/2 that I could split with my wife.  Not terrible

3) car trouble:

It was chilly that morning
When I turned on the heat, right behind the dash.  It sounded like something mechanical was trying to move into a different position, but was failing... and it was attempting every 30 seconds or so.

I was low on gas (my annoyed attitude @ sonic led me to simply hit the road instead of filling up)

2 miles later, but it's probably empty.""

An exit was approaching, the car started smoking, white smoke (i believe).  I coasted onto the off-ramp to level ground.

I popped the hood... it was smokin' hot.  And... so much for my reasoning that something 'mechanical' wasn't lining up with the ventilation system... the radiator reservoir tank was pretty much empty.

The temp gage may have said that everything was o.k.

After hanging out alongside the road in the middle-of-nowhere kansas with a 2-year-old and a 6-month-old

I added it to the radiator reserve tank and tried starting the thing.  It was like the starter wasn't engaging.  Belts were turning, so don't start.'  (so I removed one of the battery cables and cleaned a post -- my thought was that simply removing the power would reset the computer if that was the issue).

Nothing.  I banged the starter a few times.  Old trick that I thought would maybe fix the issue.  Ixnay.

In the meantime

4) All-State Motor Club had sent us to Enterprise for a car rental.  Calling Enterprise on the way, and we called all the dealerships, 3rd party auto-rental companies, towing companies, everything we could think of... NOTHING.  I got a hold of a guy who ran a towing company who said, ""yeah, if you're going to try to rent a car here on a saturday, but I've tried there about seven times

5)  So... mechanics closed.  car rental places closed.  wedding starts in 2 hours and the town is 1 hour and 50 minutes away.  The towing guy then says that one of their mechanics is in (he was from a smaller town about 20 miles back.)  They could probably take a look at it and if it's the starter

We get there.  Turns out that the mechanic left and wouldn't be back until Monday.  Sooo...

6) We missed the wedding and were stuck in a town of 1000

We did a really good job of keeping our spirits up, did go wrong.  Even the ATM machines at every locale we were at did not work.  So, no tip for the towing guy.

Well... it's now monday.  Mechanics are in.  My guesses about the starter were wrong (my not being a mechanic and understanding the sounds of the starter

The car was purchased for $5K  Getting to the head gasket will be at least $1500... and if it isn't a blown gasket

I'm thinking that the car is going to be a parts car / project car... so if anyone has any insight that the mechanic may have missed, I thought someone here might enjoy the story of my awesome weekend.

The electric wires should all be replaced as they'll corrode in a few years.
They should change my transmission fluid and oil.

About a month ago
Toyota found code P0741 Verified Failure, and when I drive those speeds, I should see my RPMs go really high. He said that probably I had put in the wrong transmission fluid at some point (more on this later.)

I knew I wanted a second opinion, but said I’d have to go to a transmission shop for help.

I searched online, and took my car for a test drive, which didn’t turn anything up. After his inspection, he said that I needed to replace the solenoid, and that I might need to replace the Power Clutch Module, but that he wouldn’t know for sure until after we replaced the solenoid and he could run tests. Apparently, Toyota put out a bulletin that there’s a known problem with the computer

His tests ran fine, so I took my car back. He ran tests again, and advised to replace the computer. I had my car back while he ordered the part, and I ended up waiting about a week to bring it back in because of my schedule. He replaced it (~$700), and just a few *hours* later, the check engine light came back (again at freeway speeds).

This entire time,000 at high speeds). No weird noises, no control issues, no trouble getting to/keeping my speed.

My current plan is to take my car back to the mechanic, and I wanted to know if any of you had advice/experience with something similar.

**Car Details**

2007 Toyota Corolla LE

1.8L 4CYL DOHC 16V VVT-i SFI Engine

4 Speed ECT Automatic Transmission

Purchased New

~66

1 accident, had to replace the radiator and AC, but I double-checked the list just now, and there isn’t anything about the transmission listed. Still, it was like $7000. (Thank goodness for insurance.)

Other than that, all of which except for 2-3 oil changes have been to Toyota, so if they think I put the wrong transmission fluid in, it’s probably something they did. At 15/30/45/60, I took it in for major service, which I would have thought covered at least checking the transmission and telling me I needed to pay X for Y service, but my current mechanic said it looked like the filter had never been replaced (or at least not been replaced in too long.) My last major service was less than 3 months ago. Either A: they didn’t even check the transmission filter, really fast. It’s had standard replacements like brakes

The only other known mechanical issue I have with my car is the water pump. At the 60, and advised to replace it soon. I purchased the replacement part, but hadn’t gotten around to getting it done yet. I asked my mechanic for a quote when I first went in, and he said I don’t even need to replace it; hold on to the part until I actually notice it leaking. He showed me how to check the water levels safely, gave me signs to look for. I really, really like this mechanic.",,,,
1368982861.0,1emze8,Very strange overheating issues on my 2004 Pontiac Aztek,stonetear,18,2,13,"Hello all-

I am having some very strange issues with my Aztek that I would like to get some input on understanding.  My level of gearhead-edness is fairly low

The car in question is a 2004 Pontiac Aztek with 113k miles.

Basically, unless I'm driving &gt;50 mph, in which case the natural airflow seems to keep the engine cool.  If I'm driving around town on surface streets, in 25-35mph range, it will redline the heat gauge pretty quickly.  Also, my cabin heat doesn't seem to work.

**However**, the temperature will magically come back down, and the cabin heat will come on, almost like the heater decides to kick on, and bleeds the excess heat off from the overheating engine.  After driving the car, there is definitely a coolant odor coming from the engine that you can smell from outside the car.

I drive this car very lightly (no more than 10-15 miles a week usually

My local dealership garage says that the head gasket is busted, and the heat gauge dropping back down from redline to normal.  

I think I'm just in the process of coming to terms that I will have to junk this car or pay for an engine replacement.

Also interestingly

Can anyone shed some light on this?  I'm fairly certain I'm screwed

It was due for a Vermont state inspection in December and as part of a little xmas gesture to her parents

Not only did the car not pass the inspection, and the rot *seemed* pretty pervasive. There were a few quarter sized holes through the frame, and the thing looked especially flimsy around where the engine torque arm attaches to the frame.

I passed the news out onto her dad. Apparently the rumor has it (from multiple sources) that the local Midas likes to exaggerate issues a little bit. At the same time

Has anyone had similar issues with PT Cruisers? It's my understanding that rotting subframe is a relatively common issue for that year. We're trying to get another 3-4 years of very mild driving (15 minute commute every week day to college and back) out of it until she's out of school. How dangerous is it? Both me and her dad are concerned that it might not actually be safe to drive even if her dad can get the local ""friendly"" shop to pass the inspection. Trying to see if we would be better off just replacing the Cruiser with another shitty car that's at least safe to drive till she graduates.

Thanks!

P.S.: Sorry for the lack of pictures. In hindsight

**Car details**: 2002 Toyota Camry V6 3L LXE - 148k miles


***


My car's starter died a few months back - simply would not start, and my car started up just fine. However, two blocks down the street after picking it up, my car began to shake and as I neared a stop light, the RPMs dropped to 0 and the engine died. I could not re-start my car.

I took the car back to the mechanic and had the fuel system cleaned and new spark plugs/gasket put in. Car ran fine for about two weeks, felt the car shudder, the RPMs dropped to 0, and engine cut. I was able to start it, but only by keeping my foot down on the gas and not letting the RPMs drop. It wouldn't idle.

This time, same problem.

The new mechanic found that the old mechanic put my vacuum hoses on backwards and that the TPS was dirty

Fast forward about a month or so to two days ago. I managed to drive my car out of the city on the interstate, the shaking stopped, but would resume as soon as I put my foot back down on the pedal. I pulled off the road and sure enough, the RPMs dropped as I was pulling into a gas station and my car died when I let it idle.

The second to last time my car died, the RPM at idle was about where it should be (idles at around 650 rpm), and I was able to get it home with no further shaking.

There are no error codes being thrown, but obviously there's more to it if it's worked multiple times to get my car going again.

They mentioned the vacuum hoses being on backwards may have been causing my car to shut down at lower speeds, but my car knowledge is extremely limited, so that's probably grossly oversimplified or misstated.


***


To reiterate...

**List of things I have done:**

* Clean fuel system
* Clean TPS
* New starter
* New alternator
* New spark plugs
* New gasket
* Fixed backwards vacuum hoses

**Symptoms experienced:**

* Shaking from the engine
* RPMs drop to 0 when coming to a stop
* Engine shuts down
* Cannot re-start car unless gas is held down
* Once re-started

Its nothing flashy but thats okay i like it =) Anyway I've always wanted to change my own oil and learn a lot about how it all works. I figured I would start by changing my own oil seems simple enough and I think i can handle it. I see however that the initial cost of it all can be kind of pricy for lifts and tools and whatnot so i just need to ask 3 questions:

1) Do you have to use a jack and stands or are ramps on the front good enough (they are cheaper and like i said I'm in college and just bought a car)

2) Will these ramps [link](http://www.sears.com/rage-powersports-pair-of-plastic-4-400lb-capacity-mini/p-SPM6524373707?prdNo=2&amp;blockNo=2&amp;blockType=G2) lift up my car high enough for me to get under and preform the work? They seem a bit small but if I also dont wanna buy something too tall.

and finally

3) Has anyone who has changed the oil or owned and worked on a 2010 Dodge Avenger before have any tips? (anything at all about the car just a curious car novice looking to learn)


Thanks in advance I look forward to reading responses and learning about my car

The previous owner let his go past the mark (65, and he ended up doing about $2,000 worth of damage to his engine, water pump, etc.  The previous owner was also a mechanic, so he ended up repairing everything himself.  

As I have no automotive skill

A) It is strongly recommended that I have everything changed that the timing belt touches (springs, etc) = $750. 

B) If I just change the belt itself, that it will cause the same amount of damage to my engine as if I'd done nothing at all (eg, not take it in to have the belt changed).

When we took it out for the first test drive everything seemed ok until shifting into 5th gear.

Shifting into 5th gear while rolling results in losing all throttle control

After noticing this we also come to find that driving in 2nd gear (about 3-4k RPM IIRC) results in the transfer case (this one is separate from the tranny) shaking way too much

My Dad and I thought it over and figured of course it would by the tranny

We're now thinking its gotta be the transfer case but could be one of these as well?

* Clutch plate installed backwards (seems like we'd have more problems in the rest of the gears and I'd like to hope we're competent enough not to screw that up)
* Clutch not adjusted properly causing 5th gear not to fully engage
* We put a spring over lift on it so maybe the drive shaft angle is all screwed up (accounts for shaking but not 5th gear issue)

**UPDATE** **FIXED**

So my friend just bought a 1988 Honda CRX HR with the D15B6 in it. It runs perfectly when cold, as it's just one 'chuff' (that's what it sounds like when it misses) or two every 4-10 seconds. It usually will idle fine, then 'chuffchuff', wait a second or two, then 'chuff', followed by as much as 15 seconds before it does it again. It smells like it's running quite rich, and power goes away (not that there was much to begin with) above 3, like you've lifted your foot off the gas.

It's got new NGK copper plugs, rotor, fuel filter (was on the original), a seafoam treatment, and a throttle+clutch cable adjustment. Compression test shows 200PSI dry across the board and 210PSI wet. I've tried pulling individual wires, but that doesn't change the behavior, though it does not throw a spark very far, and the idle did not change appreciably

Truck in question is a 1984 Chevrolet Silverado (C20) 6.2 Diesel. The truck is running great however it is consuming a fair amount of coolant. The truck doesn't smoke at all. I've flushed the coolant, with a fine vapor (exhaust fumes, presumably). Pulling the oil dipstick with the truck running throws some vapors out as well, presumably from the coolant turning into vapor and finding the nearest exit.


I have the mechanical know-how to do the head gasket job myself, because the truck had no thermostat installed and the radiator was full of that gunky sealant crap. 


I went ahead and went on a limb and got the $60 bottle of Blue Devil Head Gasket Sealant that's supposedly working on a molecular level to seal the leak. After flushing the cooling system completely and removing the non-existent thermostat

I drive a 2003 Honda Civic EX, the check-engine light came on (intermittently) with an error saying insufficient EGR flow. Local mechanic said it would be about $150 to clean it out, or $450 if the EGR valve needed to be replaced. I couldn't afford $450 at the time, so I did some research and determined that I could let it sit a while without it likely running into any problems. This seemed to be born out to be true, as over the last couple months my car has still been running fine, with no overheating or even any loss in gas mileage.

Codes from MIL: P0401 - EGR insufficient flow. Probable causes: faulty EGR valve

Yesterday and today, in addition to the insufficient flow, it said there were some misfires on all cylinders, and random misfires.

P0401 - EGR insufficient flow. Probable causes: faulty EGR valve, P0303 - cylinders 1,2,3 misfires

However, no engine disassembly required) and I can start with a bottle of engine cleaner to clean it out, or the part is about $150 and I can just replace the part.

I need to know what is wrong before so I can get an estimate so I can get a loan to fix my car. My husband says its the clutch but my dad says it isn't so maybe you can give some insight.

First my power steering would go out in the middle of a turn and then come back on after I straightened out.

It started a couple of months ago where if my car wasn't warm enough that my car would die after I pushed in the clutch and brakes to slow down. My husband thought that might be the alternator or the battery.

For the past couple weeks my clutch has felt pretty soft when pushing it in and when I go to shift I basically have to force the gear in

And then yesterday when I was going to leave for work I started my car and let it run for a minute and then I tried to shift to reverse and it would not let me. Everytime I tried

I just need to know what to tell the mechanic so I can get an estimate. Nobody does it for free out here. It is all around 40-60$ for an inspection which I don't have because I spent the last of my extra money on my dog who broke his leg a couple days ago.

There was no sputtering, red battery light also came on solid. When I turn the key, no crank. I remove the key, turn off the lights and A/C, and let the truck sit for about a minute, then try to start it back up. On about the third crank, it comes back on, and all gauges were again within normal operating parameters.

This is the second time this has happened to this truck and so far I cannot think of any single factor that both cases had in common. It's not a huge issue

I guess I should start by having O'Reilly's check for any stored codes? I'm not that familiar with OBD1 so if the check engine light is off would there even be any stored codes?

http://imgur.com/a/W7CVT

so pretty much what happened was I did both upper and lower balljoints and stabilizer link at the same time. I botched the threads to the CV axle that I had already put in and stripped the hell out of it, making prying against the transmission impossible. the old CV had a lip that you where able to pry against, and I got it out in about 10 minutes with the right tools. This one is perfectly rounded edges, save for the track where the boot locks in. As you can see I accidently pulled the boot off of it trying to pull it out. I don't know how to get it out! I've tried lots of different pry bars and places to pry off of, and nothing seems to give it that pop I need to get it out. anyone else ever come up with this problem? Currently I think I need to go grab a another pry bar that is a little bit smaller (looks like a flathead screwdriver except a lot bigger, with a bend at the end) and I might be able to get in there and be able to get it to pop, I dunno though. I'm a computer guy, but we all gotta learn somewhere I suppose &gt;.&gt;

My tipe of gasket is inserted into grooves on the valve cover. Most of the leak comes from the grooves themselves: Oil inside the engine gets inside the gasket and leaks out slightly. Check my fantastic drawing if you can't understand:

1372202032.0,1h2ked,Engine runs but I can't accelerate please help automobile warriors.,Tokyomaneater69,14,3,30,"Good afternoon
Please excuse my lack of car knowledge.Today I was driving my 2003 GMC Sierra on Camp Pendleton (Ca) and the gas pedal stopped making the truck accelerate and power steering went out. All the gauges were still operating and the radio was still on but the battery light was illuminated. I pulled over and turned the truck off and turned it back on and it started up as per usual but again the gas pedal was doing nothing. After a few tries it started up and everything was working normally. I was able to get my truck to a safe location before the gas pedal stopped working again and I turned it off. I talked to a few Marines that work at the motor pool here and they concluded that it was possibly the gas pedal cable or the throttle body. Any help and or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Okay. Long story short, and on my way home from going to advance right down the rod, the car was barely going up the hill and was acting and sounding very weird. Upon opening the hood a very small amount of white smoke was present. I then got home found out i had no oil, and put the old oil back in along with the old oil filter. It seemed fine after that. Fast forward to today. I drove it to work fine and most of the way back on the parkway (80 mph) and when i got off on the exit, it started acting weird and shaking a little bit. It got worse and started chirping like it was a belt squeaking or something. Then it really got bad. My car was running extremely loud and sounded like an 18 wheeler when they slow down. like ""chug chug chug chug"" really fast and really loud, along with the chirping. It barely got up the same hill I could barely make up yesterday barely got to my house. I was almost flooring it up the hill just to go like 15-20 mph.

So now my questions.

Id imagine my engine is shot. Is it fixable by any means? Because I rely on it to get to work. Is there anything I can do right now to try to mediate the issue? Or is my baby fubar? I would post a video

Bent rod? 

Thank you.

I have tried multiple times to push the tubes up high enough to get into the hard clips on the back

Is there a trick to this


--------


Edit: The answer : If you have some way of manipulating a rigid hose in the back of two 6 inch deep


The reality is you should definitely do it to save yourself some effort

To hopefully help someone else from my mistakes

* Prep the tank for lowering from inside the car 
 * (run the line dry
* get your car lifted up in the back for access to the canister 
* bring in the jack for the gas tank and lift it to support the gas tank
* perform the bolt removal steps for taking out the gas tank (don't worry about the 3 hose)
 * Try to leave the bolts in
* lower the gas tank jack a bit so clearance is made but you are still supporting the weight
* get to work on the canister
 * When you get ready to remove the canister
 * The right side should let go first if you need to
* when you put a canister back in
* Put it back together

edit 2: Stretch open the clips a bit before you pop it in to place

So far so good
Long story short, and hey it was a few bucks.
The dealership decided to hand over the parts after having a conversation in between me stating the year and actually getting the parts - I got 2011 stuff instead of 2007. It's similar in construct with a few key pieces, it works (and is doing the trick) but there's a bracket that is slightly off that holds the CCV. I can work with it, but it still pisses me off that I went through hell because the parts are slightly different.

I spent a week taking the train to and from work without need for other errands... the dome light was on the whole time.

The battery is less than a year old

Go home, or

Go spend $100 on a new battery before the walking-distance PepBoys closes?

I don't have time to try charging first; the store will be closed before I've gotten home, and put it back in the car.

Onto the symptoms.  When in idle I hear a tapping noise.  That's the best I can describe the sound.  If I turn the small pulley on the side of the throttle body which opens the throttle plate just a litttttle tiny bit then I can hear it increase for a second.  At anything higher though and the noise completely ceases (it seems).  This tapping noise doesn't always occur though.  But it does happen more often than not.  The engine still performs the same with the same gas mileage.  No CEL.  No idle problems because I keep the EGR system clean.  Also

This tapping noise began to happen after I was told that my crankshaft pulley has a wobble.  I was told that this could damage my bearings.  I'm no mechanic so what says Reddit?  Thank you.

Caught a second of it on video.  Start listening soon after 00:29 seconds.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV5vINqGFMo  

**UPDATE** Fixed?  My uncle came over today and so I had him check it out.  He measured the belt deflection.  AC belt was too loose and the alternator belt was too tight.  I straightened them out and that seems to have cured most of the problem.  I still hear a slight tap and the crankshaft pulley does still have the slightest wobble.  But I am hugely relieved.

Attempt to start the car with the accelerator pushed all the way down. Try this until the car sounds like it is going to start and then release accelerator. 
Did not work, but never sounded like it was going to start. No fumes from exhaust suggests no combustion.

Remove the fuel pump fuse from fuse box. Attempt to start engine until flooding sounds as if clear. When It sounds like it will start

Once you've used up your drive to reverse cycle I can hear and feel the torque converter caveating.  If you leave it in drive with your foot off the forward power shakes along with the cavitation noise.  I say cavitation

I bypassed the radiator ATF cooler and ran 2 gallons of ATF through it a few quarts at a time with no change other than a improvement in ATF color. (letting it drain from the pressure line into a bucket, joe homeowner without a flush machine stuff)

Now, pump and rollers because they were due....I'm such a good guy!) and sent him off to get it flushed once again at a garage with a machine.

**Background**: At about 103

The garage replaced the pan/gasket and no more leak.

**Issue**: Since the pan has been replaced the transmission will slip when slowly accelerating from approximately 45 MPH in 4th (and only 4th) gear. Sometimes it has a violent shudder that is felt throughout the car. Here's a [video](http://s595.photobucket.com/user/free_range_veal/media/2013-05-06_17-11-28_438.mp4.html) of the slip (shitty video

The slipping/shuddering only happens when the car has been driven for awhile. My commute is 22 miles and the problem won't start to happen (usually) after mile 15 when I exit one highway then speed up onto another. I typically cruise at 65 MPH.

**Solutions I've Tried**: I took it to the same shop that replaced the pan and they could only replicate the issue but it was not throwing any errors on their computers. On their recommendation

The dealer quickly diagnosed it as too much trans fluid and drained/replaced to the proper level. I paid for the diagnosis and drove home with a car shifting much smoother for the first 15 miles until the issue recurred.

I've talked with my friends who are car people and much more knowledgeable than me on the subject and they theorized that the extra fluid could have caused my issue when under pressure. After hearing their thoughts and thinking the issue usually occurs when the torque converter engages/disengages I'm wondering if the tq converter is the issue.

Any thoughts you have would be helpful. I want to be able to give the dealer (because they didn't *fix* it like they said) an opportunity to redeem itself. However

**UPDATE**
So the dealership is recommending a new transmission. Looks like I'll be shopping for a new car. No sense in putting the money into the car equal to what it is worth.",,t5_2s47e,1371487355.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1gchcl/2004_mazda_3s_23l_hatchback_4speed_auto_with_106k/

I was driving, as well as a sound that I can only describe as air rapidly being released (also sort of muffled).
After the initial noise, the car makes a shit ton of noise, and is very loud. When the car starts, it sounds like an actual nice, fast car starting, i.e. it's nice, slow and a low sound.
The sound seems to be coming from the bottom of the engine block

**Performance**

After the incident, while making a lot of noise. It also seems to take a little longer for the gears to ""catch"" when switching gears while driving.

It was running just fine, but I don't really hear anything. I tried starting it a few more times, and the same thing happened - as soon as the RPMs fell below 1000 or so, it would stall. I tried giving it some gas while starting it, and was able to keep it running as long as I was revving it up, but as soon as I took my foot off of the accelerator, it would stall again instead of idling. 

I tried putting a bottle of IsoHEET+fuel injector cleaner in it today, it idles really roughly at around 500-1000 RPMs, and kind of makes a hiccuping sort of sound, and the whole engine and everything is really shaky. There is also sort of a clanking sound whole it idles.  It no longer stalls immediately, but when I put it in reverse to move it, it eventually stalled again.  

I did a bunch of googling and was thinking it could be a fuel pump issue

Does anybody have any ideas as to what could be causing these issues? I'm pretty broke so I don't want to bring it in unless there are no other options, estimated repair costs, etc. hope you guys can help!

1360282878.0,183kr6,Saturn SL 1999 - The sound of water comes from the dash when I step on the gas,goishin,11,1,12,"Hi guys
I've a 1999 Saturn SL. Several months ago I moved into an apartment complex that requires me to park my car on a steep hill. The front / rear of the car are level

I believe it might be something with the car's coolant system, all those air bubbles would accumulate in the heater. So, I had the cooling system flushed to try to get rid of the bubbles. This seemed to work, but eventually the sound returned. So, I'm wondering if anyone else out there knows what else to try?

Further troubleshooting information:
The pouring water sound occurs when I rev the engine. If I put the car in neutral and rev the engine I still get the sound. If the car is sitting still and I rev the engine I still get the sound. And no coolant appears to be leaking out of the car.

The first issue that I've had is lately when it is cold out when I put the car in reverse from park

So I'm not that great with cars and I noticed about a week or two ago my oil was creamy

Yesterday I made a quick trip less than a mile away to a local supermarket, pumping the gas to get it going.

Now just today at about midnight I went out for fast food

I stalled at a red light, I drove to get my food and notice my car was not overheated - but running really really hot.

It has a dummy gauge from C to H and well

Ate my food

It was really really low on radiator fluid too. Like put two gallon jugs into it and it wasn't even full yet. I plan to put more in it and take it a few blocks away to a trusted mechanic

If its something like the head gasket and can be replaced - its a 500$ car with 160k miles and an engine that has already been replaced from a junkyard before I bought it - would it be worth fixing? ( Note I'm broke and can't repair it

If it isn't that.... and there is permanent damage to the engine - is there anything I can do short term or basically should I just scrap it. Right now I'm not going out/driving at all and I do have options thankfully.

Was changing some fluids from my new baby

Got to the rear differential, drained the old differential oil.

Then I didn't put the drain plug back on. (which would have made sense, for keeping moisture out of the enclosed system).

Anyway, refilled the diff with 80-90W gear oil, and she drove fine for a few 100km but now there's this fairly constant grinding at higher speeds coming from the rear of the car.

1343424443.0,x9o6f,"'11 Mazdaspeed3 - Shredded tires after 13k miles, not sure if alignment, my driving, both?",Patcher,1, and while I'm actively educating myself about my car, however

Basically, it became apparent that doing the [coin check](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=51) and rotating my tires (front&lt;-&gt;back) hadn't been enough. The insides of all my tires, were basically shredded, the worst of which being [this guy on my left front](http://i.imgur.com/PS2VS.jpeg).

The mechanics at the shop speculated it was an alignment issue and/or my penchant for taking corners fairly hard, and my daily commute can be, depending on the route, about 80% deserted, twisty country backroads).

My tires/wheel history is thus: 8k miles on my summers (225/40R18)

Basically my questions are these:

* Should I be getting my car aligned more frequently? If so
* Is hard cornering really enough to skew the wear pattern as much as in the pic? My gut is telling me that hard cornering should still wear the tires fairly evenly if the car is properly aligned/set up.
* If hard cornering is enough, or can something be done to my alignment to mitigate the wear (or at least make the things wear more evenly)?

(Sorry for the essay

So I was happy with my purchase yesterday, etc), so nothing indicated anything wrong with the ignition. Ran smoothly as well, so nothing indicated a transmission or engine problem.

This morning
_____________________________________________________

I'd been used to everything automatic in a previous car (locks, so my first time leaving this older car I checked to make sure nothing was left on to result in a dead battery. Called AAA fearing the worst. (I realized at that very point how little I actually knew about cars cause I didn't know where to start troubleshooting.) I figured I could have it taken into a nearby shop and have them troubleshoot (while learning as much as I can about the processes). AAA rep suggested jump starting the car (I said to give it a shot, but the power windows, radio, and headlights were all working, and I remembered to turn everything off, so I was not hopeful). 

Turns out his jump helped. He said that if upon removing his jump recharger, but the car kept going, so I felt better about the situation. He left and reminded me to keep the car on for the next 30-45 minutes to have the alternator charge the battery. Meanwhile I ran errands to keep it running, and then got back home after just above an hour and parked it.

After leaving it off for about 20 minutes, car wouldn't start.

I left it for a few hours, but to no avail. I'm thinking it's these $10 cables not supplying enough juice between the Accord and my other car ('08 Saturn Vue), or it's actually dead this time.

-------------------------------------------------


**Some additional details you may need to know:** the car does not ""crank"" or ""click"" when I turn the key to start the engine. The car seemed to run just as it did yesterday in the hour it actually drove today. There is a chime that occurs when I open the car door (and no, I've verified). When I do try to turn the car on, the radio display and digital clock on the dashboard, as well as lights on the dashboard all flicker.

I figure I'll call AAA tomorrow and have it jumped again or have it towed to a shop, or the alternator.

Backstory: I have a 2004 Dodge Durango. Last week while driving it on the highway, and model, but Dodge has not made a recall. The dealer wants $8000 to replace the engine, but a friend and I can probably do it for half that.

Prior experience: I have experience working on cars (done an engine swap in a '95 Honda Accord

Vehicle information: Dodge Durango SLT with a Generation 1 5.7L HEMI

Tools and resources available: I probably have all the tools required (unless it's something out of the ordinary that you wouldn't typically find in an automotive shop). I have the service manual for my vehicle.

This is the basic procedure I know from my prior experience:

1. Remove hood after marking the alignment with marker or tape.

2. Prep engine for removal. This includes depressurizing the A/C and properly disposing the freon; draining the oil

3. Remove drive and serpentine belts, cooling fan, starter, spark plug wires, etc.

4. Remove power steering pump and A/C compressor

5. Disconnect radiator and heater hoses and remove radiator from engine bay.

6. Disconnect and unplug vacuum lines and electrical sensors after marking each component with tape to make installation easier.

7. Detach and plug fuel lines.

8. Disconnect major components like exhaust pipe and manifold. Unscrew transmission/engine mounting bolts. Remove inspection plate and clamp transmission torque converter to keep it from falling off during engine removal. Make sure to mark alignment of torque converter and drive plate to make reassembly easier. Unfasten torque converter from drive plate.

9. Disconnect driveshaft and rear engine support.

10. Secure and detach transmission from engine using tranny jack.

11. Hook engine crane to engine and raise engine off engine mounts enough to release the weight off engine mounts. Remove engine mounts and insulators. Double check all connections between engine and engine compartment have been disconnected.

12. Lift engine out of engine compartment and place on engine stand or used tire.

Some guidelines to go by:

* mark all connections with tape
* sort and label bolts so they don't get mixed up and you know where they go
* take pictures of de-installation process to make re-installation easier

Am I missing anything? Does anyone else have prior experience with this and have advice to offer? **Does anyone else have step-by-step instructions for this project?**

Also, but I'm just making sure.)

Any advice/information on this topic would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

My only concern is the car seems to be sluggish to accelerate but seems to drive normally once you get going. When I manually put the shifter in 1st gear it accelerates normally and then I can put it back to D4 to shift to the other gears without problem. It seems like it doesn't shift down from 2nd gear to 1st unless I do it manually but shifts fine going from 2 to 3 or 3 to 4. 

Could this be indicative of a imminent problem with the transmission?

* How long have you owned the car for?

* Is your name on the title? (I'm in Arizona and have seen so many titles that don't belong to the person I am trying to purchase a car from)

**Things to do:**

* Let it idle for 10 Minutes

* Drive it for 30-45 minutes

Things to Check:

* Check Underneath the car for dried fluid or pools of fluid.

* Look at the wheels

* Does the Axel look damaged?

* Dried grease anywhere under the car?

* Check the rear end differential

Under the hood look for -

* Cracks on any of the plastic
 
* Breaks in any of the lines
 
* Discoloration of any plastic (yellowing)
 
* Radiators should run stable

* Look for the A/C

* Check the interior

Look at the engine -

* Is it clean?

* Any dents?

* Wobbling?

* Look at the muffler

* If there is any kind of crusty powder on the engine? This is a huge warning side.

Wrong! Today I was getting off the highway, but going into third gear the clutch wouldn't grip.

Regarding **coolant flush**:
&gt; Engine cooling system flushing is recommended only if the customer has installed incorrect coolant in their engine. In the very rare instance when flushing is necessary,000 miles and every 60,000 miles thereafter. There is no justifiable reason to recommend coolant replacement more often.

Regarding **fuel induction service**:
&gt; Fuel injection (induction) cleaning/flushing is not recommended by American Honda. This is an unnecessary maintenance procedure and an improper repair procedure. If a Honda vehicle is experiencing a fuel injector malfunction

I was finally able to get in touch with a Honda shop that spoke English and asked Service about fuel induction, but I could just be cynical.  The entire notice from Honda seemed to be very candid and forthright in what is best for customers and what is a waste of both their and the Honda shop's time.


I have about 69k on my car, I've fixed - such as brake pads or air filters, etc).  So it's not like it's in poor condition to begin with.  I found another shop that's better rated and offers the services recommended more cheaply, but so far I'm leaning towards only doing the LOF, brake flush, and a trans drain and fill.  That said, the Honda shop I finally got in touch with today to ask about the flushes/inductor service said they'll do a complete flush (without the machines) for $245, so I'm considering finding someone who will do a drain and fill and doing that 3 times


**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for the time you took in crafting such invaluable responses.  I'll be taking the car in on pay day and I can't tell you how much I appreciate being given straight advice on what actually needs to be done.

**2nd Edit** Just came back from the shop and just wanted to say, I told the guy at the shop that I would be planning to take in the car for 2 more drain and fills (rather than do a flush), and when he came out from working on it, he said that it might be better to wait on the second drain and fill since the transmission fluid apparently wasn't looking that bad (this was something the shop that gave me the original quote said needed to be done right away).  So basically I saved about $600 based on a consensus reached by you guys.  As someone who is broke as a joke but who was planning to splash out on what I thought at the time was necessary maintenance, I can't thank you all enough for teaching me enough about what I needed to know for this stuff so that I didn't get totally screwed.

I ran into my first problem when removing the axle from the transmission. Fine, so I had to remove that. It wasn't as hard as the axle but I got it out.

I got the new axle, great, but there is a larger section to it that cannot go in. It's like a small collar on the axle and I know it goes in, but I couldn't. 

This is where I started making mistakes. I decided to put the axle into the hub already so it could apply pressure to the other end of the boot. I got it into the hub easily and forced the ball joint into it. I accidentally tore the ball joint so I'm going to need to replace that. I then continued trying to push the CV in by hand. It was difficult since it's in a VERY awkward position... 

Here I made the big mistake. I tried to use a prybar to hold the cap near the inner boot in and hit it with a hammer. It didn't budge

Are there any tips/tricks to getting the whole CV boot in? I can't get a good angle and am really limited in leverage. Is there a special tool for this car? Also

tl;dr Cannot insert axle completely into car, need advice...

Thanks.

**Edit: Mission Accomplished.**

I got the car back together today (Can only work Tues. &amp; Wed. due to work schedule).
I was able to get the exchange done at Autozone

I then proceeded to smack the axle in while holding it straight. It took a few good smacks with the rubber mallet and it eventually went in and seated itself very well.

I did damage the seal on the inside during removal. There's a little metal ring with a slight hill and holes in it. I smashed one side of it pretty bad during removal (tried with a small screwdriver first). The seal (green thick ring

When i bought the Car in October everything looked very clean. Previous owner always did service/oil change on regular basis. Just put in a new clutch less then 3k miles ago. Testdrove it and felt so great!

Now the car sat for quite a while because i didnt want to take it out in the bad weather.

After i finally got to drive the car now i noticed occasional clutch slipping and immediately contacted the owner about the specs of the new clutch that has been put in the car and if he knew about the problem. 
Previous owner then refused to give any information about anything pretty much and claimed car is fine. Now with the time passed the warranty obviously expired so i couldn't really do much about it.

Now here are the symptoms.

- There are days where there is no clutchslipping when driving the car no matter what speed

- The clutch will start slipping badly after being stuck in traffic (alot of stop and go aka. engage and disengage of the clutch) and then gets normal again after about 30min out of traffic

- After there was clutch slip in any gear it is very hard to push the clutch pedal down for the first time afterwards.

- No burnt clutch smell... ever!

Now the Fact that it is a rather new clutch in the car just makes me unsure about my fruther steps.

we dont have parts here (in Switzerland) for these cars so it will take some time and alot of money (shipment + taxes) to get a new clutch.

So i really want to be sure if there isnt anything else that could cause this problems.

I can't speak to the state of any parts on the vehicle that I haven't touched - I bought it at 186k from a used car dealership that claimed that they PM'd it, and now the truck is at 240k (I drive a lot for work).  But, wouldn't a fuel filter or PCV valve trigger the the CE light?  (And, FWIW, was $15 of 93 octane with a bottle of fuel injector cleaner.)
  
  
Thanks for any suggestions.  Tonight
  
UPDATE - I completed replacing the plugs and wires this afternoon.  Success!  The truck ran smoothly during a test trip around the block, which I replaced in the lot.  And, then...
  
FAILURE AGAIN.  I hit a small bump in the road, though, the problem hasn't been solved, so I guess that I need to start checking wires and connections?  ",,False,,1365204983.0,t3_1bpmml

1. Dual filament bulb for the turn signal only lights up one filament, really.

2. It blinks very short and fast; when driving it blinks faster with acceleration and slows down as I brake. I think this might be why it's so dim--it doesn't have the time to completely light the filaments as it blinks so quickly.

3. The rear driver's side turn signal ALSO blinks irregularly now; it suffered no damage whatsoever. I'm guessing they're on the same circuit?

So I'm guessing that it's an electrical problem

1362969897.0,1a258b,1996 Subaru Legacy Brighton. Water Pump replacement and transmission issues,Potato_top,12,3,7,"Hi

On top of this my auto transmission is having problems on hills. I took it up a hill on the weekend and it was super sluggish and ran at 4kRPM even on shallow slopes. If I put my foot down a bit made a lot of noise and then lurched up the hill while sounding really strained. The fluid is actually at a good level and still looks alright when I checked it myself. 

Initially some googling pointed towards head gasket issues

I took it into a garage today and they have said I need a new water pump and coolant flush. They didn't mention anything about the transmission either as I had some problems communicating with the mechanic (who was foreign). The price is a bit steep for a student. 

Is the new water pump/radiator flush a sensible sounding fix for this and most importantly is this something I can do myself? I understand that I would have to remove a timing belt as well to access the pump?

The transmission is also a pressing issue as I like taking it into some steeper areas of the country (New Zealand)

Car has tough time idling when it's cold outside

**Long version:**

I turn on car, it runs fine. However, after it gets warm, when I turn the car off and I attempt to turn it on:

*Immediately - 0.5 hours later:* The car starts fine.

*0.5 - 1.5 hours later:* Starts, if I go somewhere, I have to either leave immediately, or commit to being there for 2 hours.

*1.5+ hours later:* The car starts fine.

I consistently get the same timings each time I start the car. If I try to start it right before half an hour has passed

I also get a ton of random error codes

I've now spent a ton of money on shop and home repairs. Shop did a fuel system cleaning (but didn't replace the fuel filter itself, they said both the alternator and battery were dead. Wanted to charge me more ($350) for it. I said fuck that, got a jump starting pack ($80), and was able to get my car home.

Bought alternator, and I'm not taking it back there again.

**Other potential issues:**

* Shop said battery was completely dead, and it appears to be holding a charge just fine. Should I get it tested anyhow? The battery's also only 18 months old.
* It's due for an oil change
* Also, it looks puke colored (like, mix of green and orange). I got a few bottles of coolant to try doing a complete flush myself, but I can't fit under the car to disconnect the coolant line without a jack, and I don't have a jack yet.

I am fairly mechanically-minded and I have a local AutoZone and a Chilton's manual.  I would prefer to fix easier things myself, but it didn't hold).

This is what the dealer says I should get fixed

* replace leaking front and rear struts ($1700)
* align vehicle ($129)
* replace worn wiper linkage ($276)
* replace loose worn shifter U-joint ($341)
* replace leaking power steering pump ($536)
* replace leaking valve cover gaskets ($392)
* diagnose noise at front of engine ($312) - they said that they thought it might be the timing belt, according to the previous owner

The wipers are annoying but I've gotten used to them (sometimes they don't go down the last 2"").  The shifter is also loose, but I'm not sure if these are really all that urgent or if the dealer is just trying to get more business.

TL;DR my car is old and has issues

Thanks!

EDIT: The dealer actually didn't comment on the thing that annoys me the most about the car

DOUBLE EDIT:  Thanks very much for all of the feedback!

Since the struts are so expensive

I found a few links online that show how to replace the worn shifter U-joint - apparently I can get the whole knuckle for about $60 and it's an afternoon repair.

I also found some links about tightening up the windshield linkage - it also looks like an afternoon repair.

I haven't noticed any issues with my power steering

I've been restoring a '66 Ford Mustang for two years. It's going to be a daily driver, otherwise known as the TC pump). I have been through THREE pumps within ~1000mi. Every time that I kill the pump, it's the flow control valve. It seems very prone to getting stuck (both open and closed) and usually requires me to take the pump apart to poke at it until it pops back into its normal postion. I have pulled it out before to examine the edges of the valve for burrs; there are usually some, which I file / sand down very carefully. After that the valve will work again for awhile usually, but it never stays working. I am running an oil filter in the return line to ensure that particles stay out of the system but I'm not sure if it's working. Entire system has been flushed multiple times and it's still being an ass to me.

I was gone this summer for a job. When I left the power steering was not working and had been working intermittently for the past week; when I got back the power steering was working again. I have no idea how long it'll last this time. Does anyone have any ideas about what I could do to make the pump more reliable and keep the valve from sticking for good?

I drove my car into work this morning with no trouble (and didn't hear any sound) but after going over a bit of a bump in the parking lot I started hearing a noise quite similar to the one in the video.  I didn't have too much time to check it out because I was already running late

I suspect either a bad wheel bearing or bad CV joint.  I guess it could also be worn brakes but I didn't notice an increase in noise as I was braking (noise seemed louder during turns). 

I'm not too sure what to do here.  Obvious first reaction would be to take it to a mechanic, NY and my lease ends next week so I don't have many options here).  Clearly, if either the wheel bearing or CV Joints are bad I don't exactly want to drive that distance as the chance of death is something I'd like to avoid at this point in my life.

Another chain (attached to a larger chain department store, putatively trustworthy shop looked at it and at first thought it was only the bolt that needed replacing, which was a relief for her at the time -- she paid about $100 and drove off the same day, only to find that the symptoms came back. Returned to the local shop and they found, indeed, that the rear struts needed replacing - which raises the secondary question of whether they should take some responsibility for not having properly diagnosed the problem in the first place, or at least credit her some portion of the $100 she already paid. The local guys are also quoting her about $600.

Types of chains:

1. Cable chains. Probably the most common type

2. Link Chains. Similar to above

3. Diamond Chains: Same as above

4. Some New Type of Chains. I just learned about these ones when I started looking stuff up online. The basic story with them is that you bolt some sort of thing onto your lug studs at home, such as in a skid. They're also pretty expensive. Example: http://www.thule.com/en-US/US/Products/Snow-Chains/SnowChains/Thule-K_-_Summit

Class S is required for most cars. The class is defined by how far the chains extend out from the wheels

Tire chains are either self tightening or need to readjusted after you drive a hundred feet or so. Self tightening means that they use stretchy rubber loops with clips to keep the chains tight

Chains go on your drive wheels. If you want extra braking power and stability when stopping

What is really difficult about my search, even between differing products from the same manufacturer. The durability of chains, their stopping power, relative traction of various chains, I haven't been able to find any information on any of that, besides sifting through reviews reviews on Amazon.

My spouse and I are thinking of selling our 1997 Nissan Altima to buy a hatchback or small wagon.  The question I have is whether it is worth it to do repairs on the car before selling it

* my car-savvier friend says the muffler is nearly rusted through.  A new one costs about $125.
* the right front fender is a different color from the rest of the car due to some cosmetic damage on the old one.

Other than that, but there don't seem to be any pressing issues with the engine (still runs great, doesn't sound different.  Last time this happened, it was a knock sensor that was out of place and cost $500 to fix).

The car stalls when idling - I literally have to put the car in park and rev the engine while at a stop light, I received the code [P0102] (http://www.obd-codes.com/p0102).

We also got the code [P0171] (http://www.obd-codes.com/p0171) - which we again attributed to the MAF sensor being bad. We will see if this clears once we get the new sensor installed.

It started when I was accelerating onto the interstate, I stepped on the gas to accelerate to match speed with the traffic. Once I stepped on the gas, the engine bumped, hiccuped for a second, and I shifted up into 3rd immediately. I smelt a burning smell, more of rubber than smoke, but that went away quickly. The engine light came on as I shifted into 3rd.

 I stopped the car, no detectable change in performance, so I went to get the engine code from Autozone the next day. Comes out as ""VTEC malfunction."" It's been driving fine, so I just reset the engine light, thinking it was a one time thing with no permanent damage.

However, but only under specific circumstances. The issue is the powerband will just disappear, as in I can feel steady increase in acceleration until I hit about 6k RPM, then it just all goes away, and the engine starts to make a very different noise. The noise matches the engine sound, but it's a lot higher pitched.

The weird part is, once I hit ~6k RPM, the engine gets really loud, adds a lot higher pitched noise, and all the power just disappears. The torque/power when it malfunctions is similar to the torque/power I'd get out of 5th gear at 2.5k RPM.

About 6 months ago I bought my used Subaru Outback at 130, and my engine started acting normal. I took it to o'Reilly's and had them check it out. The code said it was a Cylinder 3 and 4 misfire. Since then it has happened a few more times, and just a couple days ago it was really bad, and stalled my car out twice, and made a squealing noise and was very slow, sluggish. After about a minute, it stopped and I took it to my mechanic and left it with him to diagnose. Unfortunately, put it up on the rack and didn't find a problem. He told me that it might be the head-gasket leaking coolant into the cylinder

My other problem, transmission pan, oil pan, and steering rack leak, the dealer wants me to finance over a $1000 to get that done. At my mechanic's, he said all of those were 'seeps' and not major leaks to be addressed right now. 

My last problem is this

So for my questions
When the engine misfires like that
Is this engine misfire affecting my fuel economy? 
Since this engine misfire is so sporadic
Is the squealing in the morning something to worry about?
My mechanic told me that my catalytic converter has a light code in the system

* Front shocks very soft
* Rear brake pads uneven and low rotors close to minimum.
* Rear shocks leaking.
* Front brake pads low and rotors undersize.
* Castor rod bushes starting to split.
* Top radiator hose coolant seepage.

Those were the things that had me the most concerned. They also reported the following.

* Found coolant stains around water pump.
* Brake fluid flush.
* Tyre (3) replacement and alignment.
* Airbag light has come on.

 * I believe this is from the driver's front right door. That door hasn't had any electronics working externally to it for a while now (it can operate its own mirror and window, I figure there might be damage to the power conduit of the door harness but I'm not sure.

My rear brakes didn't work for a long time. Took it to a shop for something unrelated, the rotors were covered in deep rust and when the brakes started working, it chipped the rust off leaving gaps that also tore apart the brake pads.

A couple days ago, luckily for me. I didn't really know/forgot to spray brake cleaner on the rotors, but I did wipe them off (maybe not enough). Anyway, now while I'm driving, I hear a bit of a squeak coming from the back. When I stop the sound changes a bit, but it's still a squeak-like noise. Could this be because I left too much of that oil on the rotors? I drove it for...somewhere around 40 miles since I put them on and it's still doing it.

1363261277.0,1aa23c,Is it possible to Safely jump a circuit in a fuse box to check the wiring to tail lamps?,wezelx,9,2,13,"Basically I'm working on a 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel truck. I'm getting no power to the rear left taillights. The front left turn signal is working fine but the rear left was dead for the tail and trailer lights. I checked the wiring in the rear the best I could with my limited skills on a multimeter and found a possible short on a heavily corroded jumper. Also I replaced blown fuse (#46) and now have power to the left trailer lights but I still can't get the tail lights working. All other fuses are tested and functional. I'm almost positive the wiring is 100% in the rear of the vehicle. I think I narrowed the problem down to the Front Control Module or the wiring coming into the integrated power module somewhere. 

I was wondering if its possible for me to pull out the left and right tail light fuses and place a jumper between them (possibly two paper clips jumped on each respective side) to verify the wiring is good to the left tail lamp. meaning if I had the right turn signal on then the front right would blink and also the left tail? This way I would know its not a wiring problem and definitely the FCM. ",,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1aa23c/is_it_possible_to_safely_jump_a_circuit_in_a_fuse/

1361750587.0,195rp2,1973 Datsun 240Z - Starts then immediately stops,hacksign23,9,1,23,"Hi everyone!
So I bought a Datsun 240Z on craigslist a while ago and have been problems starting it.
This runs on a 2.4L carbureted engine

Start car for first time. Oops forgot to change dead battery and attach coil + cable to coil.

Start car: It turns and starts within 1-2 seconds

Apply Starting fluid and repeat

- Keep doing until a carb (2 stock su roundtop) floods. oops

Rebuild Carbs

- Take everything apart
- Boil in degreaser (simple green + water)
- Put back together with rebuild kit

Put cleaned carbs back on car

- car does same thing: Starts then stalls after letting go of ignition
- Carb floods after many attempts

My friend and I determine the float bowl setting is off

Since only one was flooding

- Piston was determined to be warped so it was fixed
- Float level adjusted

Put back on car

- Random event: not getting spark from plugs
- Determine coil to be malfunctioning


Currently: Getting another coil and sending other carb to shop

The main problem is the fact that the car starts for 1 second, one carb keeps flooding instead of not allowing more fuel. 

What could be the problem?

I couldn't quite reach the end of the right inner tie rod with the tool so I put the rack all the way to the right.

I was looking at this thread http://bbs.legacycentral.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=45717

and it shows a vent hole on the driver side and there could be one on the passenger side . Could that vent hole have reached the fluid chamber causing my system to bleed out? Or did I screw up the seals? If the rack is fine any tips on refiling the system and bleeding the air?

Did I maybe overfill the oil? Things I should check? The oil filter was in tight after replacing it and the oil level seemed fine after a day of driving it.

I don't know a ton about cars so don't worry about insulting me. I will try to be more specific but as the car is sold and not in front of me I can only go off what the purchaser says.
