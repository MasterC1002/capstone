Live just outside of Fargo, above 75 they get 45 seconds (4.5 gallons). It has been pretty hot and dry here for the last month. On days where it gets above 90-95 they get watered every evening for 45 seconds each.

The trees have been looking great up until this week. Now all of a sudden I am getting purpleish leaves. The existing leaves are lush and green-not thin, soil issue, temperature issue? Should I even be worried about this?
