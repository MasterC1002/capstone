**Getting Mana:**

* Survivals are usually the best way to farm mana. Putting hardcore (HC) on increases drop value, less predictable spawns, and more wyverns.

* There's a higher drop limit with more people

* To play NMHC survival solo

* If you start at wave 9 or above, so at 13 you'll get 720 from each chest. However you can't start at a wave until you've beaten that wave on the same difficulty.

* Once your build is solid

* During long rounds, then you can loot a bunch of stuff and 'sell all' at the end of the round. It's worth noting that the items that disappear first are those that the game deems the lowest quality, so if you're interested in finding good drops to use, you don't need to worry about frantically searching/looting during the wave.

* Magus Quarters is a good map to start with, which have great drops.

* Be aware that there is a 'soft cap' at 600 million mana. At this point you will stop getting any more mana from item sales during a game. When the game is finished you can make a mana token in the tavern (under 'services'). During a game, because the rest will fall by the wayside as you climb the gear ladder. On a similar note, it's generally not good to use upgrades on resists for your build characters. It's tempting to try and make an all-rounder, but really you'll do better keeping your tower and DPS characters separate. Soloing Magus Quarters NMHCMM you will easily reach the 600m cap from zero, and then some. 


**Using Mana**

* Some people are initially confused by how to shop. There's a 'view shops' button at the bottom left when you're on the game search screen. People host 'afk shops' where they sell their stuff. Once you're able to solo Magus Quarters

* Bear in mind that items can't be valued in the shop for more than 600m. If something is on the floor

* Myth armor can vary hugely in quality. The best pieces are higher quality than a lot of trans stuff in terms of the stats they give you. You can reach 1500-2500 tower stats with just good mythic armor and a decent weapon/pet. Info on set bonuses and armor types can be found [here](http://dungeondefenders.wikia.com/wiki/Armor).

* You can also buy items on the [trendy forums](http://forums.trendyent.com/forumdisplay.php?32-PC-Mac-Trading-and-Grouping)


**Cubes and high-level trading**

* A 'Cube' refers to a floating companion cube pet

* Each player can only ever get one cube. When you get yours **DO NOT UPGRADE IT**. A non-upgraded cube is referred to as 'clean', although that information will likely be redundant in a month. That sounds like a lot, but be wary, at very high levels most people aren't interested in selling you things for mana, they want to trade for other rare things (other cubes, supreme armor, pet rocks, ultimate weapons

* Getting your cube is a great way to make a leap in progress


**Getting Experience**

* The more people in a game, No Player Damage (you didn't get hit that round), and Only Used Weapons (you didn't damage enemies with towers). They seem to stack by addition (i.e. for all three, you won't get (1 x 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.3), but rather 1 x 1.9). It's sad that the game rewards relying on someone else's build and hiding in a safe spot not taking damage, but there it is.

* The best maps for levelling are Glitterhelm Caverns and Aquanos. Aquanos is considerably better


**Miscellaneous**

* Turning off camera shake

* Use a genie! Genies are pets that give you mana when you damage enemies with your character's weapon. The amount depends on the base damage of the genie. A decent one will get you around 300 mana per hit which is more than enough. They're a reward for reaching wave 15 on Hall of Court Survival (medium or harder). Genies are great for helping you quickly upgrade all of your towers during the early stages of a survival. You'll need to hit for about 20k or more in the tavern to get the most out of your genie in nightmare. More detailed info on genies [here](http://forums.trendyent.com/showthread.php?32590-Some-Math-on-Genies).

* Imps are pets that repair nearby towers/auras automatically

* While hero damage is scaled down in nightmare


**Building Tips**

* Since minions use MU instead of DU

* Archers and mages are generally considered the best bang for your MU buck, allowing you to save DU on barriers. Building a buff beam for them to stand on is often effective. Alternatively, squeezing archers onto buff beams that already exist for your harpoons or fireball towers is also effective.

* Your build should be centred around trying to get as many things buffed as possible, although buffing a blockade will increase it's resistance to damage. A buff beam will go down when something it is buffing goes down, so be careful about buffing blockades.

* When something is being buffed

* Always upgrade your buff beams first. Upgrading them makes your towers hit harder, which drains quickly in nightmare. If an aura goes down, your buff will go down, which can easily lead to your defenses being overwhelmed.

* Never underestimate wyverns

* Any tower or group of towers should have at least one archer nearby

General game mechanics

a) exp sharing: just make all exp shared 100%. It's anti-griefing and it keeps people from competing for kills and making stupid decisions. If someone isn't doing their part (legitimately) then they can be kicked by the host.

b) elemental resistant, but it also helps out the classes that need the biggest buff. This simple change along with adding physical as a possible resistance makes apprentice and monk towers much more appealing and the physical resistance is also a slight nerf to squire towers.

Quality of life changes

a) Pets (and maybe some items) unlock when you swap them on your hero. Keeping them locked would be nice. I don't want to sell my pet on accident because one for this level was better and I forgot to relock it.

&gt; **Level 74 DPS Toon Gear Guide**

&gt; For your DPS toon, all 4 resist 10+ starting, hero dps +50 or more, piercing +50 or more, and no negative hero stats. (run spd prob won't matter)... and YES, matching is important. 30% boost to ALL gear stats.

&gt; An ideal piece would have 14+ starting value in all 4 resists

&gt; First, then move on to the next... always watching for the 10th upgrade where you can go back and upgrade a capped resist more.

&gt; Your first 20-30 upgrades will probably be all resist. After you are capped in all 4

&gt; This will give you max 90% resist in all 4 stats in non-NM games... basically making you untouchable unless you try to melee 3-4 ogres at once. (You can almost afk insane UMF)

Let me just say that my gear isn't amazing by any means but I get around 10-12mil dps in tavern and have 80%+ all resists in NM.  I can pull some weight basically.

A fellow redditor Wanglah AKA Money on steam

I randomly join a nightmare game from the lobby and Money happens to be the host (it was NM Uber Monster Fest).  I was happy to see him and I tell him how much my gear had improved from last time he saw me

After wave 12 ends I look up and see the first 2 green items of the entire run (I hadn't picked up a single piece of loot up until this point.)  Since he gave no time to do anything except ready up, BOOM I get kicked and thought wtf maybe he misclicked on me or something.  He then messages me on steam:
10:46 AM - Money: mass loot = boot
10:46 AM - Nacho two one: wow ok
10:47 AM - Nacho two one: was just 2 items but ok
10:47 AM - Money: you ran passed me and picked 4 up
10:47 AM - Nacho two one: they were green didnt have time to look
There was someone else behind him

Anyways

Edit: Im not just directing this as him but to everyone.  This is just one case in many but I think in general kicking is way happening way to often without reason.

TLDR: Just cause you CAN kick doesn't mean you need to do so every 5 seconds.  I guarantee a warning would do or giving a second for someone to react before you kick them will go a long way.

I am a predominantly solo player, so it was a steep learning curve to get there.

Spiders were always annoying, forcing players to invest much more heavily in gas traps covering every lane, and even with fantastic positioning, phenomenal builds, and stats pushing 3k, I find that somewhere in the realm of 80%-90% of the time, djinns still wreaked havok, much like djinn, they have created a scenario where even the best of builds can only stop them *most* of the time.

Now, losing somewhere between 10% and 20% of the time with djinn simply getting through gas traps during rearm time.  Instances where djinn would wreak havok but I would recover were prevalent at a significantly higher rate than this.  With sharken, on a map like Misty, I have scaled back from Mixed Mode, started the map at lower levels (17 or so as opposed to 21-23), and I now have a roughly 30% failure rate each wave starting around 20.

My impressions as to why this failure rate is occurring lie in two areas.  Firstly, with few to no ogres and other enemies.  Sharken, on the other hand, spawn much more periodically, in the midst of ogre rushes, spider rushes, and djinn rushes, thence giving the sharken time to initate charges or increasing the opportunity for the sharken to get through gas traps during rearm times.

Secondly, which compounds the opportunities for things to go wrong with trap gaps, bizarre pathing, or glitched mobs behavior.

Ultimately, but focus on what this new set of challenges does at each and every release of new content.  Here I am, a perfect anecdotal case of how, instead of being challenged by new content and rewards, I am instead struggling to maintain my already-current level of achievement.  Certainly there are new builds, I have tried many, and certainly there is more powerful gear to obtain that makes content easier

New builds that the ""voice"" of the TrendyEnt forums point to in order to show how successes are possible (whilst denigrating my own opinions on current content and trends)

1) high-end builders of the following classes:

-TowerHP Series EV

-Buff Beam Series EV

-Traptress

-Squire

-Monk

2) High-end dps Boost Monk

3) End-game pet such as a Mega-Chicken or Trans Monkey

Even then, where unless the player has actually maxxed out gear options, they are struggling *more* to achieve *less*.  This does not feel like a new challenge or progression, it feels like what it is: being browbeaten further from ""end-game"" content with each successive patch.

What are possible solutions?  I am sure there are many

I am unsure whether this sort of commentary is worth bringing to the Trendy Forums

**Some background:**

Von Wolfenstein shoots only electric damage in a + pattern with 5 projectiles

So long as the hero and tower stats on a weapon are not negative

The base stats that we will be concerned about are Base Damage

*NOTE: There are 3 other important stats that are not dealt with here: Projectile Speed, a high reload can negate a small clip size and leading shots can negate low projectiles. Keep these in mind when selecting your VW but they are not part of these numbers.*

There have been some screenshots floating around of hacked VWs with slightly better than perfect stats

***The maximum un-upgraded stats on VWs are:
**
*

* 
70+ Base Damage (have seen some 71's
* 
5 SPS
* 
3 Proj
* 
33 Upgrade levels

Every VW should max SPS and Proj for maximum damage. The maximum for these stats is 6 SPS and 4 Proj.

By knowing these numbers we can break every VW down into 2 numbers

We can find EUPS with the Number of Upgrades (UPS)+(SPS-6)+(Proj-4)

This gives us the number of upgrades available to increase Base Damage and allows us to compare VWs with different stats.

With this

The following is the damage of VWs from 30 to 75 Base Damage over the 31 possible EUPS.

[Overall VW Damage](http://i.imgur.com/bkyTJ.png)

As we can see

We can also see that as the Base Damage increases

Looking at the high levels of EUPS

[VW Damage from EUPS 25-31](http://i.imgur.com/ZXQex)

The difference between 70 and 60 Base Damage is worth ~1 EUPS

The difference between 50 and 60 is ~1.5 EUPS

**Because of this, 31 UPS VW**

This also means that a 55 Base Damage/33 UPS/4 SPS/3 Proj Von Wolf will be better than a 70 Base Damage/33 UPS/3 SPS/2 Proj Von Wolf.

With Base damage being so much less valuable than EUPS

[VW Damage from EUPS 0-6](http://i.imgur.com/4lUST)

As we can see

The difference between final damage of 65 and 70 Base Damage at 31 EUPS is 22 (1098 and 1120)

The difference between final damage of 35 and 40 Base Damage at 31 EUPS is 38 (920 and 958)

**TL;DR/Conclusion:
Above 45-50 base damage

""Here I have found some threads where people advise the use of the Portal Gun

Little did I know, Sky O' Love Challenge Mission* is where fun goes to die.

I joined a group of fellow lvl 74s and quickly impressed the other players with the basic idea I had taken from reddit: Using 6 magic Blockades, with a Strength Drain Aura on top to make the magic last longer.  Then, 1 or 2 of us will teleport the new couples together while the others tend to the Magic Missles, Proximity mines and barricades guarding our crystals.  We were all specced out decently in medium mythical gear, with both DPS and Tower builders having stats in the 700s.

A simple enough plan.  We were excited.  Were optimistic.  We were fools.

In the end, culminating in a mob of Ogres destroying one of the crystals on wave 8.  We never completed the mission.  At the tavern, afterwards, we realized it was past 1 am.  But the time wasn't important.  Our willpower was broken, our souls were tarnished.  Some of us questioned whether we would ever truly be able to love again, after what we went through.  We each quietly left in turn, forever changed by our shared experience.

We just gave up. We don't really have itnernet issue. It happens to just get disconnected. Add bad luck to this and this is what you get. I'm sure many people here had to deal with the same issues. Getting disconnected on a 10-minute map is no big deal. On a 1-hour-long map


My suggestion would be to add a ""Resume your last game"" option. Here me out :

**What does it do ?**

*It allows you to resume your last game almost where you left it.*

**Does that apply to any game ?**

*Yes it does. Whether you crashed during a game or decided to ""Exit the map""

**Where can you ""Resume your last game"" ?**

*In the tavern

**Can you have several game ""paused"" ?**

*No you can't. If you start a new mission (and therefore do not select ""Resume your last game"")

**Does the save bring you back to the last building phase?**

*No

*The game does have some frequent saves. Let's say : You loot something during the combat phase, chances are it won't be in your bags. The point is : the game already has some ""in-game autosave"" implemented for characters. The best solution would be to add it for the map/game ITSELF. Therefore :*

* *If the game crashed/got disconnected
* *If you quited the game

**Worried about people using that to have more time to plan their tower placements for Insane ?**

*No

**Is the game saved for everyone ?**

*No, you will not be able to ""resume"" the one of the other serveur*

**If I have a ""saved game"" and go play on a server

*No it doesn't. Since the maps aren't saved on your side (because you're not the host)

**What about the number of creatures ?**

*You hosted a 4 player game and crashed. As we all know : 4 players = more creatures. You decide to host again


* *If your last auto-save was during build phase : no problem. The amount of creatures adjusts itself like it normally would.*

* *If your last auto-save was during combat phase : You'll have to wait until the build phase to see their number decreases. Basically

What do you guys think ?

That said, I usually stack them to have maximum effect along with other towers but I've had trouble in upgrading specific ones. Currently the game prioritizes the lowest level tower for upgrades and the most damaged ones for repair. The current solution is to skew them in position so that there will be an area where only one of them is available.

1324073273.0,nfntg,"My thoughts on Trendys ""DLC"".",Volkamar,41,21,77,"OK



Trendy is, without any mention of DLC, then deciding at the last minute that a certain part of this patch you will have to pay for. Why are they doing this. Do they simply want to create discussion by including it all the patch? Or could it be something more  subtle that they're seeing what parts of the patch are generating the most interest and then taking that and then charging you for it? Whatever it is, this practice is wrong and deceitful in my opinion, and I am finding it harder and harder to continue supporting a company who insists on nickel-and-dimeing the player base which is helping to keep them afloat and giving them the success that they have been getting.



But the arguments for what Trendy have done is what gets me more, it's just the price of a Sandwich, What are you too poor to get this or something. It's barely anything."", and yes while the content itself is cheap, there are two resounding facts that have been neglected in this argument. The first is that $4 for Gender Swaps with new Abilities, is a lot of money, when you compare it to the fact that the game is around $12. Not only that, it's ANOTHER price of a Sandwich that I am paying to get the optimal playing experience. Just look at the numbers since the time Trendy released Dungeon Defenders

* The Game Dungeon Defenders
* To get all the content from the game via it's DLC, and if you want to experience Nightmare Mode you need to pay a Whopping £7.49. That is around £12.50's worth of DLC, £11's of it could well be considered essential, as it changes the very way we play and experience the game.

AND THIS IS JUST FROM THE FIRST MONTH. If the game was Free to Play I could perhaps understand, even Subscription based games like WoW or Rift are more merciful at this present stage, What does THAT say to you?



Another argument that seems to come up a lot is ""But they're an Indie Developer, the guys behind Terraria, you may have heard of them. Possibly. They just recently released Patch 1.1 for their game, which radically changed the very way that the game is experienced and adds a whole new Tier of gameplay with over a hundred new items, new NPCs, new Monsters, New Bosses, as a patch



The last main point that people seem to bring up is ""I can justify paying for this because I have put over 100+ Hours into the game."", ""I have put 100+ Hours into the game and this new content drastically changes how we played the game, I don't want to fall behind or become obsolete, so I guess I should get the DLC to avoid such a fate."" (Because, let's face it, it's either that or grinding to buy them for extortionate Mana Costs at the Player-made Shops). How many of you, honestly bought this, at that time, a new weapon there



The fact of the matter is, and to an extent, still do don't get me wrong. They will likely continue to place content in the guise of Patch Notes to generate interest and have people say ""Oh wow! Check out what this next patch will have. New Difficulty Modes and Brand New Maps. IT'S JOY!"", then all of a sudden turn around and say, ""Here you go guys, here's the new patch, oh but if you want this part of the Patch that you were talking about so admirably, How long are you going to deem this practice as acceptable?



So you might ask, is tell us what is going to be DLC, and keep it SEPERATE from the Patch Notes. At least that way they would not be coming off as deceitful and the idea of paying for the DLC is a lot easier to stomach as a result. The second thing, is to perhaps revise the pricing or even what they put in as DLC. Perhaps leave the core parts of the game like new difficulty modes and perhaps even new maps out of DLC and make them available to everyone. But stuff like extra Costumes, i'm ok with having that as DLC, as it doesn't directly impact how the game is played. I would be more than happy with that, in fact I would probably shell in



Anyway

(In no particular order:)

- You haven't discovered the fast menu transitions option
- You don't have push-to-talk enabled
- You run to the crystal and press E to begin
- You have several level 74 characters but still run up to people and press F trying to see their info in a normal game mode.
- You are not even level 74 yet but you are confident enough to believe insane UMF will be a breeze.
- You have millions of mana but all your equipment and pet are level 1 because you either don't realise that upgrading is critically important
- You don't know how to hide a public game or make a private game and have steam friends join you. You also name your game something like ""DO NOT JOIN OR KICK""
- You consistantly whinge about how hard nightmare is
- You play on Open and think it is somehow more legit than Ranked
- You think that DefendersStore is updated in real-time or a great way to quickly aquire items in its current state of deployment.

And a bonus:

- You don't understand how the loot dropping system works nor realise how much mana you are losing because you don't understand it. Extra points if you kick people for taking generic loot early on in waves with several thousand mobs. (I estimate that collecting loot and maxing your inventory each wave is between 8 and 10 times more profitable than waiting for loot to 'improve' as 'poor' drops are removed and replaced when the drop cap is reached.)

---
Edit: [Since I've already been called a cunt:](http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/okudy/ten_signs_you_are_a_noob_at_dd_or_how_to_not_look/c3i1z5t)

Fast transitions is in the main game options (turn off Camera Shake while you are there too :/ ). Push-to-talk is in the voice preferences, host a private match and press Hide Match. Nightmare mode was only released early - as a bonus to those with the complete DLC set preordered - because it was aimed at experienced players who were finding insane too easy and who wanted a challenge. It was originally aimed for release with the 4th eternia shard DLC when we were all running around with level 80 characters, more powerful weapons armor and pets, and with significantly higher (&lt;1000) stats.

The bonus tip refers to how the game manages dropped loot when there are many hundreds or thousands of mobs per wave. There is a limit to the quantity of loot that is on the map floor at any point in time. You can even see loot dissapearing if you watch carefully during combat or

A lot of people are under the impression that the map holds infinite loot which is all perfectly converted into mana at the beginning of each round. This is not true for larger waves (more than a few hundred mobs). Older crappier loot is removed as 'better' (what the game considers better, it is still far more profitable to pick up ALL the things at any stage of the wave rather than just leaving it sitting there. You tend to make more if you pick up later in the waves than earlier, as I mentioned this is because of item values. Many hosts are fine with looting, but often will tell players to stop looting when a certain number of mobs remain. I often see this number being the last 500-1000 mobs but in some modes (mix mode for example) even a few hundred remaining mobs might be sufficient to replenish ALL the loot on the map so that each player still gets some instant mana when the next round begins. The downside of this is that you'll tire of pressing E to collect page upon page of inventory loot, I rebound my E key to a mouse thumb button for comfort.

So the clear winner is Fireball towers now (even more so than before). It's also really hard to justify a Deadly Striker now unless you really need the range.

Slowly, and it goes without saying that they all warrant their own critiques. 


Enter: **Dungeon Defenders**, and I followed Trendy across their sparse, but informative development updates, and even purchased the version for mobile devices. The premise of ""tower defense"" games was new to me, and relatively speaking, is still now. I like the mix of strategy and positioning. What towers work best where, and which locations make for the best 'chokes'. 

So, what did you actually *think* about the game?""

Needless to say

In a world that rewards purchase over progress, does remarkably well providing incentives to continue playing. Merely reaching max level, or completing the game's main story does not even come close to the total one can achieve. All main missions and challenges have four difficulty levels, each rewarding on a different scale, with different weapons that vary in size, and attributes. Just leveling up your character to max will not provide a similar character as the rest of the community, as each individual piece of gear worn by the hero has its' own level, can me raised to further buff your statistics. There are many unique pets that offer abilities from attacking, and gloves for exactly the right fit. 


But for me

You could dedicate an entire article to the art style, I'll just let you know: Truly, amazing job.

And the Tavern? Wow. Awesome.


* ** As an avid player

*Disclaimer: I understand that not all these are easily implemented, hopefully long, life.* 

1. Personal stat tracking

2. Non-buffing titles given out to those that have achieved tough goals. Things like ""50k Monster Kills"" and ""All Missions completed on hard"".

3. Staying away from DLC that gives the player anything. Offering DLC like the Halloween event was brilliant. Reward for play

4. Raise the level cap higher

5. Implement more achievements that could customize the tavern with completion. There wouldn't be anything more amazing than to join someone's server and see post cards from completed levels

6. I know it's coming

7. Allow players to dump mana into structures to upgrade them the same when you can armor and weapons. And have a casting system similar to World of Warcraft and other MMORPGs, or gets thrown back an increment. 



Thank you so much for making this game Trendy! I look forward to future patches!

1319861484.0,lsy33,Volo's guide to farming hard Glitterhelm with a Tower Squire.,volothebard,17,1,9,"This is a guide for people starting out farming this monster of a map. Pro's will already have their own ways and I'm not pretending to teach them anything. Also I'd like to apologize for my skills with Paint

First we start with the [map](http://imgur.com/ekZjq) 

A B C D are the crystals

[A.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969339/?tab=public) You also might want to place another crossbow facing the one I have here. Your main danger on this map is not wyverns but Assassins. They like to come up from behind and rape your crossbows. With dual crossbows at this point you can pretty much leave this entire area alone.

[B.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509970592/?tab=public) The Slice N dice is optional. Many times you will do this map and a creature will never come down those stairs. Every once in a while a goblin or assasin might make his way there so I place the SnD so I can ignore this area. Feel free to pile on more crossbows as well as this will be where the heaviest concentration of Wyverns will harrass you. 

[C.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509970191/?tab=public) Crystal C is your chill place. Not much should get to this crystal and it's a nice place to sit while holding shift to observe your towers health. I stay here unless a lane gets dual Ogres or an assassin slips through somewhere. Try to keep full mana so you can pop rage and run to any area that might need help. Also

[D.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509968616/?tab=public) D is an easy crystal to guard especially if, this crystal will never be harassed by wyverns.

[1.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509966597/?tab=public) This is your main problem area for the map. Feel free to put 3 or 4 crossbows here but usually 2 is enough. If you get double ogres here and you are on the other side of the map

[2.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969782/?tab=public) Often the single Cannon is enough but I like putting the bow there since it is an ""outskirt"" area and I may be elsewhere when it gets hit by double ogres. I have never lost this position though so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

[3.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967458/?tab=public) Pretty easy area to defend made doubly so by my tendency to camp C. if your tower range is large feel free to place one of those bows on the top right rail so it can get any summoners that tend to hide behind the corner.

[4.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969007/?tab=public) Another trouble area. Lots of ogres tend to spawn here so keep an eye out. Also

[5.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967842/?tab=public) Not a hard area to defend

[6.] No picture to add here

[7.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967030/?tab=public) Again

So doing just what I have pictured here you will only use 125 of 165 DUs. That gives you 40 to play around with. Also you will notice I do not use cannons that much

My Squire stats are

Tower Health: 110

Tower Attack: 168

Tower Speed: 125

Tower Range: 48

Squire Casting speed: 70

Squire Walk Speed: 40

As for weapons I use a High Five to help me deal with Ogres and I use a Djinn pet to fuel rage. I started doing hard Glitter at around level 45 or so

Few other things, on glitter it is rare that I get less than 400k, I've hit 600k on lucky runs. XP as well is a lot better, until the 60's I was gaining almost a level a wave. Also, I try to grab as many chests as possible, not for the mana (my djinn takes care of those needs) but the chests on Hard Glitter can drop godly's. I usually get 1 every four runs or so.

Edit: One small thing I want to add about the wyverns. When placing your harpoons at A and B be sure to place the Harpoons behind the crystal from the direction the wyverns fly from. If you place the harpoons in the path of the wyverns, but it makes running hard a lot easier since the crystals heal at the end of the round. ",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,True,apprentice-steam,

Like a fireball tower with about 1/4 the damage, 1/2 the attack rate (twice as long), 1/2 to 3/4 the range, scary green magic and a slow. Such a tower would nicely round out the apprentice's arsenal

There are two distinct problems I'm seeing here. 

1) Each gear level seems like it requires THAT gear level to obtain. I need good myths to have the stats to farm myths reliably. I need good trans to have the stats to farm trans reliably.

To me this seems absolutely counter productive

2) The status quo gets absolutely fucked with. I understand the desire to make new challenges and harder things to overcome, old things I used to be able to do to earn mana or farm x or y are no longer fiesable, and now progressing just got harder so it's more difficult for me to progress my own stats to just keep up with the status quo.

I think it's perfectly acceptible to have all the new nightmare mobs in the later content (you know

Yes you can alter your stragegies to counter this but sometimes the new strats you need to counter new elite mobs require better stats which is already hard as shit to do

This is a serious detractor to the enjoyment of the game for me. When i want new challenges i want to buy the new maps and move forward into new maps. As it stands i have no incentive to buy new content because the existing things just become even more and more impossible and the barrier to entry for the newer stuff becomes higher and higher.

It seems absolutely counter productive to me and only serves to drive people away I think.

1) There should be an intermediate difficulty between Insane and Nightmare.

Here's one potential solution:
In NM

This would do at least three things to game playability:

1) It would allow there to be a nightmare mode without any of the crazy new mobs. This would be the intermediate difficulty many have asked for.

2) It would allow old strategies used prior to different shards DLC being released to still be used and perfected.

... most people play ranked and so if you can't play these maps in ranked then most people won't play them. (or make them) If we get maps into the ranked then people might make more and people will also play them. And it also allows for us to have more variety in maps.

1319860125.0,lsxiv,Dungeon Defenders has restored my faith in humanity.,Zephyrion,19,4,8,"This is gonna be long

Back in December of 2010, why not look up random cool words? One of these words was Dungeon, and that brought me to Dungeon Defender's Steam page. After reading everything I could and watching every video, every screenshot I could find, I added it to my wishlist hoping it'd be released in early 2011 so I could play it with all my group of friends.

The next part of the story most of you are familiar with: The game gets finished but Microsoft and other various approval processes slow down the actual release date for months upon months. I start to lose patience, Rift, and TF2 to pass the time.

Finally a release date is announced after waiting far too long, of course, that day it gets patched and fixed. Awesome.

Play for a few more days, and I am again happy. I've cleared the game 4 times in 4 days from start to finish, and I've got a squire and apprentice already at half the level cap.

Today, poor sportsmanship. I play more Dungeon Defenders and forget about TF2 for a while.

Things go well when I decide to start characters on Ranked just to earn steam achievements and participate there instead, this time in my own tavern, picking it up on the 2nd level where I dropped out. I solo it completely, and then go to Magus Quarters.

In Magus Quarters, and I've made a new friend where I normally wouldn't have. I show him the first boss and don't skip any of the cutscenes I've already seen half a dozen times. He goes to bed, and I finish up Servant Quarters, and DD crashes shortly afterwards... no big deal, not even mad.

1325983565.0,o7cj9,[TIP] Collection of UDKENGINE.INI tweaks that might substantially improve your DD performance,Wax_Paper,14,3,10,"I wrote most of this up for a buddy the other day

The Dungeon Defenders config file is called **UDKEngine.ini**. It can be found in the following folder (with the letter ""X"" representing the drive that DD is installed on):

X:\Steam\steamapps\common\dungeon defenders\UDKGame\Config\

First off, while leaving the rest of the ""High"" graphics settings intact (which means you can still take advantage of cool things like postprocessing, bloom, etc.). These values just change a few custom settings that can make a big difference in performance, while still keeping the game looking good.

Open the .ini file in Notepad and search for the following settings. The easiest way to find them is to hit CTRL-F and type the setting's name (everything before the ""="" sign). Change each setting to the values listed below:

* DetailMode=0
* GraphicsQualityMode=0

These are two settings that can potentially have the most substantial effect on performance

* DynamicShadows=False
* AmbientOcclusion=False
* UseHighQualityBloom=False
* SkeletalMeshLODBias=1
* ParticleLODBias=2
* MaxAnisotropy=1
* MaxMultisamples=1

Depending on your GPU

If you try any of this

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention that your .ini file could be reset back to default every time there's a new update to the game installed via Steam (and sometimes it resets itself for seemingly no apparent reason). I change my .ini file to ""Read Only"" most of the time, because there could always be new, intended changes to the .ini with each new patch.

With the launch of this game on the PC platform, gear inflation, casual vs. hardcore players. The only MMO I've played for a significant amount of time is WoW, so I'll be drawing my examples from it.


In the beginning, then some quick nerfs led to Apprentice towers being best, and now with tougher and tougher monsters, people are giving up towers for traps and DPS heroes instead. If someone currently wants to play a Tower Squire, there's no place for them outside of a few blockades. It took Blizzard 2 or 3 expansions, but now anyone can play any spec and have a place in raids.


We're seeing the number of upgrades on gear inflate way too fast. Just last month we were working towards stuff with 20-30 upgrades. Now we're seeing stuff with 141 upgrades: http://forums.trendyent.com/showthread.php?31870-7.12e-loot-o.O
Maybe they need to introduce daily map lockouts or something
""Heroic-mode"" Ramparts each day will reward a random super-loot item and a few bits of special currency.


That kind of system would allow casual players who might play an hour a day to complete a few maps and get a few super-loot items, nor do I have the gear to even beat UberMonsterFest.

1344731895.0,y2lce,Class Concept: The Engineer,ThomasOrth,18,8,28,"Just something I thought up while killing time at work. For the theme

The Engineer is pretty exclusively a builder class. He can place towers normally, much like the EV's beams. Towers built on tracks can be moved baack and fourth along the tracks, allowing defenses to be shifted to where they're needed most depending on the situation.

Towers:

Gatling Gun: A 'magic missle' sort of tower. The gatling gun does low damage at an extremely high rate of fire

Mortar: Extremely long range with splash damage

Barbed Wire: Placed like a beam. Stops weaker enemies

Flechette Turret: Hits a wide range for low damage at a moderate rate of fire. Used to provide cover over larger cover areas that would usually require multiple turrets.

Mustard Gas: Not too sure about this one. Imagine the Huntress's Gas Traps

Abilities: 

These are super rough. I had trouble thinking of anything fitting my theme

Air Strike: Used when you need a bit of fast defense over a small area. Swaps into an overhead view where the Engineer can call down an explosion with a moderate splash. Not as much range as the Summoner's Overlord ability (ie the whole map)

Battlefield Maintainence: By expending extra mana

Escort mission sucks: it sucks because most of the time, spawn them at different points of the map (north and south maybe), and make the enemies attack them. Don't spawn them in the middle of enemies right from the start...

1338618890.0,ugw1e,First impressions: Summoner,bulletr0k,10,0,9,"The Summoner has been out for about a week now

**Pros**

Great solo class

The MU points instead of DU makes him a welcome addition to a team

Beautiful animations for the summon glyphs and runes

Each minion has it's ups and downs and useability

Flies! (Hold down Jump)

**Cons**

Harder to get off the ground with a level 0 new player

Stats/gear is needed badly before even trying to solo some of the earlier stages

You feel really useless with no weapon and no dps pets

The overlord interface takes some getting used to.

Lots of buttons and clicks to get out your minions



**Overlord Mode (2)**
A neat spin on hero abilities, upgrade, and repair defenses across the map without being interrupted (I also think the casting speed is a little faster).

**Phase Shift (3)**
Similar to the Overlord Mode

**Flash heal (0)**
At low ranks/few points, and heals for a set percent. I'm curious how good it would be with more points placed into it.

**Minions**

*Archers* are awfully slow early on, however.

*Spiders* are pretty awful I think. They can slow and take away abilities from creeps

*Orcs* are wonderful in the middle stages

*Mages* are the cream of the crop. High damage, and they can *heal* players and minions (NOT TOWERS). Well worth the 180 mana and subsequent upgrades, you will most likely build a LOT of these bad boys.

*Warriors* are nearly exactly like the enemy, wasting 300 mana. Putting them in a choke point can make them circle slice, however.

*Ogres* are everything you'd want and more in an ogre summon. Tough, ugly, and costly (600 mana, unlocks at level 30), this monstrosity will be plentiful in your stages and will bring a pounding worth the mana.

The traditional ""best weapons"" for the Huntress in the popular view

Retribution: Classical ""shotgun blast"" weapon. No pierce

Bone Bow: Classical ""rail gun"" weapon. Single line of fire

Disk Thrower: A slower bone bow that fires along two lines. 

--------------------------

I'd like to argue, constant-use weapons. Wondering what other people think on this:

#1 - **Attenuator** model. Aka Lava Beetle Exterminator

The problem here is that you're only going to get a high quality one if you're very, though - max fire rate of 8, standard damage upgrade curve, and it shoots through infinite numbers of small enemies and WALLS. Walls, folks - obstructions aren't. Given its longer-than-average range, can we not see the potential for power here? Strangely, though - perhaps because it's harder to get

#2 **Chicken Gun model** - Also known as Coop Protector

Now hear me out. Grenade launchers, to be sure, (your piercing shot says ""hi!"") but on maps where bowlers work, this gun can also work. Standard damage curve (which is unusual for AOE weapons), AOE damage, and the ability to bounce and drop down to places that might be awkward to shoot otherwise. What makes the Chicken gun truly significant, though, *its damage is not fire-based.* No fire immunity protection from the dread cluck. Get the RoF up on this

#3 **Shaitan of the Thousand Winds** - the demon-faced flamethrower.

Much like the reason the Chicken Gun is potent - it's a flamethrower with a neutral damage base. Flamethrowers are either flame or poison based as their chief damage type (never seen an electric one) and this limits their otherwise considerable effectiveness. With a ROF 15, obviously, is both the element issue (which the Shaitan avoids) and their range. If you were to stand behind an inverted barricade, though, I'd argue that these things make one heck of a case for an ogre-flambe tool.

You will need:

Tower Monk

Tower Apprentice

Some DPS class(I used Huntress and you might not even need a DPS depending on your tower stats)

Here are screens of my own stats(Mediocre Gear)

[Huntress+Blasticus](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034864783/F0F07599B0B589375F873C84E75B191FC8619F94/)

This setup is not perfect but works wonders if you dont have amazing gear and is almost AFKable.

**FIRST WAVE**

Start off as your apprentice and grab all the mana. Try to cover each chokepoint with at least one tower(excluding the air paths if you have a DPS character). It should look something like [this.](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034859957/9226B7AFB428AA3A4B40CA8FCEDD43BE588D81F4/) Change to your DPS class if you have one. You will want to fend off any loose ends

**SECOND WAVE**

During the second wave switch back to Apprentice if you changed to DPS earlier and then begin adding more turrets where they are needed. If you do not want to read the tower placements please refer to image at bottom(Final Setup).



*Northern Crystal;*
 At the north crystal I have 2 MM and 2 FB towers facing west; 1 MM facing the crystal for wyverns; 2 MM and 2 FB facing the northern spawn. 

*Southern Crystal;*At the south crystal place 2 FB towers facing the pumpkin spawn/itembox that is north of the crystal. Place an additional 2 FB towers facing the west roof(place them on the wall next to the stairs). 2 MM towers on the stairs also facing west towards the roof.
Place 3 MM towers on each Air path and then put 1 FB tower on either of them(not both).

*Middle Crystal;* Have 2 MM and 2 FB towers facing west towards the pumpkin spawner. Place 1 MM behind the crystal to protect from wyverns. At the southmost bridge place 2 MM and 2 FB towers at the end of it.

After placing these switch to monk and place Slow+Electric auras at each chokepoint.

[Final Setup](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034856380/6396EAFFE482FF1F09E1346C3D1A53CA2DD0079F/)

**THIRD WAVE AND ONWARD**

From here you should be able to relax a little and pick off stragglers. Make sure to upgrade and repair in between rounds, it is safest to dispose of them yourself. Because of this I usually stay on the north crystal and wait [there.](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034860967/48C8F127A939601231552D285684147F2B1AEE31/)

I completed ES NM HC and I found a Laser Robot in my shop. Since I play on Open, and it has 97 upgrade levels.

It's damage is just over 3000, and 5345 Projectile speed.

It's damage in tavern was 6.8k per shot. I loaded up ES again and it was doing ~~14.2~~K PER SHOT. I can post some pictures later for verification.

I loaded up No Towers Allowed on NM to see how far I could get solo. Made it all the way to Wave 6 with just this guy, but it was rather hilarious. I imagine that CtA will also buff the pet's damage, but I don't really feel like leveling a countess.

I'm having trouble NOT using my Genie after the first 2-3 waves. I feel he's just too good, greatly out weight even having a Tower at 3 Stars. But I just can't pry my hands off the Genie knowing it'll only hit a few towers when I could just Upgrade ALL my tower quicker with a Genie.

I love this game. For some reason I love the grind. Everything I've done

I feel the one thing lacking with this game is the lack of info around.. That's a bold statement to make, stuff is so spread out and buried, it would take hours (maybe) to find what I'm looking for. 

[The Wiki](http://dungeondefenders.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Defenders_Wiki) is GREAT, I'm not, I love it. But so much stuff on there is out of date. Maybe it's because patches change things so dramatically? I haven't been around long enough to know or understand that. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is: There needs to be something to help out people like me. Not a, now you know everything."" But an easier way to find what, again, people like me are looking for. 

As another example, MAN! So, I did. On stuff that makes sense, of course. Tower stats, things like that. I Up'd the logical things, I think, but someone else might not be so clear on what to upgrade on some great gear they may have found/bought from a AFK shop. If they don't make money often

I'm sorry this is so long winded... I didn't mean any of this to sound disrespectful or rude. I love the community. I love the game. I feel bad because I always come to Reddit and ask questions about what seem like obvious things. I feel like I spam the board with such simple questions that it makes people gain a dislike for people like me.

Last thought. I'm ok with SOME amount of timeplayed=power, there is a point at which it creats a chasm between the players that treat the game like an 80 hour-a-week job and those that are just looking for a diversion.

50-60 hours to get your character at least near high-end power? Its a lot of time but even a casual with moderate playtime per week could probably do that in 2-3 months. 500+ hours to get your character at least near high-end power?

This was on local single player. After beating a level I exited to the main menu because I decided I wanted to go play online. When I went to play online I made a character with the same name as my local character

So

1. Do you have to quit to the tavern before quitting to the main menu for it to save?

2. Did making a character online with the same name as my local character screw something up?

3. Is there any small chance that maybe I can boost myself back to where I just was? I mean

4. How do I stop this happening again? Because there is *no save button*

Every couple levels I throw a point in area of effect and defense attack speed. Once in a while I put points in move speed and my health to try and not get too far behind. And I focus my gear on defense related stats. On to my questions.


1. Am I wasting points by putting them anywhere other than defense stats? Are there specific defense points for the squire that are significantly more valuable than others? When I level up my equipment should I only put points into my defense stats or should I also buff up weapon damage

2. Can anyone help me with an ELI5 version of the different challenge modes. How should I progress through them. Should I jump to hard first

3. What are the most efficient uses for my mana? Level all my equipment? Purchase items from the tavern? Should I just farm and save for things or drop all my mana back into my gear?

4. Is there any DLC that I really should not pass on the opportunity to buy? If there was 1 or 2 DLC that I should really have. Recommendations?

A little backstory: I logged on hoping to get a level or two of the main campaign done on NMHC, normally through the main menu by just looking through a filtered list of nightmare games.

So I was looking through the menu and the only game that wasn't in a tavern

Upon getting in, whose game I'd been in just before this. My character is level 76.

A description of what was going on during the chat log in the picture:
He asked me if I had a pet, since I had a genie. Before I asked him if he was ready, I went around and opened chests and gathered mana from the last round so I could use it to upgrade a thing or two, which I did. (Edit: I said ""G when you are [ready]"" to let him know that I wouldn't press G until he did, and that he didn't have to tell me he was ready, all he had to do was press G to let me know.) Then the last part of the chat log happened, after which he immediately kicked me.

What the fuck?

It's like every time I join the game of someone who is nightmare-ready

I bought Dungeon Defenders for my PC a few weeks ago and played it for a while now. The archievement you have to get for the steam holiday sale might be quite difficult for new players that just started today and try it alone

Fair warning though: I'm from Germany

But hey

---

**WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THE ARCHIEVEMENT**

You have to complete the holiday map ""Etherian Holiday Extravaganza"". You can download it for free on steam.
On this map you have to pick up presents (always at the same place) and deliver them to christmas trees on the map. It's always a different tree and you have to deliver a couple of presents to a tree (more presents if you play with more players)
You have to deliver the presents to more than one tree later one (last wave = 4 trees). You have only a few defense units
You can only pick up a present when nobody else has a present in his hands. It takes 10 seconds to lay down a present on a tree. If you get hit while carrying a present

I'm awake and ready guys! My steam ID is ""di_L3r"". Just add me or write me a pm

So

The first Tower (Harpoone) was at a Attack Rate of 0.5sec. So it should attack 2 twice a second

Afterwards, but the DPS only went up to 2.5 times the Attack Damage. (Should be more than 3 times it...)

So, allthough i did not find any values for the harpoone. The wiki seems to not have them (atleast i did not find any info on that matter in it).

But the second point is, why the damage in is lower in both cases than it should be. Anyone has an explanation for it?

Some frame of reference. My highest character is a 72 adept. I have a 70 barbarian

1. Do Accessories drop in Nightmare only or just more ""often"". I've played dozens of.Medium Glitters lately to level up as well as finally completing a 25 waves of HC Insane Deeper well and have seen nothing yet. I understand they are rare but I've seen multiple people claim this rareness being ""one drop per game"".

2. Speaking of Glitter

3. I've got my characters all specced for tower building. 

My adept is spread out over damage

My countess has health and damage maxed. The spiked blockade is all I use her for ATM

EV is damage and attack speed focused. I mainly use it for the Buff Beam on my Adepts towers but occasionally her proton beams as well.

My Monk is specced for aura lifespan and damage/effect. I only use his ensnare aura in my defenses.

So finally the question. Is there any way I can better spec these characters for the roles I've given them? Or should I change what towers I use them for?

4. Any advice for Pure Strategy runs? I found the only way i could beat deeper well on Insane was to leave some blockades at rank 3/4 then upgrade mid battle. Is this a common tactic or a sign that I should rethink my defenses/try again at a higher level?

I got an app and a monk both to 78 and both with pretty good but not fully upgraded mythical gear. My monk is DPS oriented while my app is tower oriented. I enjoy the idea of ""soloing"" this game by swapping well-geared heroes out myself and getting through levels on my own with a strong tower character or two, and a really good DPS character.   

I tried the nightmare on TDW with a couple snare towers from my monk and a solid set up from my apprentice, I also wanted to ask if transcendent gear was actually feasible - and where you even obtain it?

 Now I'm not trying to go on a rant or anything but I think if I can bring some of this to light more it will help the game and the community; even if just a tiny bit it will be worth it to me.

**The Biggest Issue: Balancing**


**UMF:**
Now I know this has been said over and over again and the developers have an uphill battle against this sort of thing. UMF is a disaster and will continue to be since it is supposed to be for the best of the best, or form. Obviously veterans are going to have better gear but this is a little insane to be nowhere close to their level and worse yet you need to rely on them to get anywhere or be forced to grind your hands off to be able to afford anything decent by their standards.


**TL;DR:** UMF has done more harm than good because the gear and the divide is just too distant from people that play the other maps and challenges. You need the strong geared people to get you set up or prepare your hands to be in casts after grinding for ages to get decent gear to UMF hoarder standards.


**Classes**
I don't believe I need to explain myself here since this is a fairly common thing to hear that there needs to be more balancing. Squire for example: ""why you useless for anything except Group Hug since my level 70 Countess doesn't count?""


**The Next Biggest Issue: The Players:**
I recently joined a pubic survival map on insane where the round had just ended and there was this fellow soloing it all. Now being any normal person I saw a green item and I picked it up and equipped it and then the host saw me and came unglued. He asked me ""who I was ""(Note: He was swearing and using much cruder language than what I'm going to put here in this post as him saying) and ""what I was doing taking items."" I replied to him saying I thought it was acceptable to equip dropped items that were green for your character. Then I was booted within seconds without any further comment. I tried to come up with a logical explanation for why he chose to do this since he could not have used that item on his character he was playing as. I came to the conclusion he was most likely soloing and he hosted a public game. Then I thought about how other people and myself have been treated in other games since people are too narrow-minded or they're focusing too much on trying to grind for that decent gear possibly. I've come across plenty of people like this that boot without disregard that make the community and the game a tiny bit more unappealing. 


**TL;DR:** Can we please be a little more friendly on publicly hosted games instead of automatically booting? This will make the game and the community look better if you put more thought in for others.


The more I think back about things like this the more I am thankful I had friends to play with early on or I doubt I could have lasted as long as I have now with the game. So please Trendy

My suggestions for the balancing is really do more testing and absorb as much input as possible like any other game. Though this is much easier said than done but in the long run it will be worth it if you take your lumps now.

You really can't change people but you can make the atmosphere a little more friendly

Thanks for your time reading this and I hope you all share your feelings about this or other issues you've come across.

I've searched through the forums a bit, etc. However, these all seem to assume stats that are a bit higher than what I have. For instance, they suggest running Insane Glitter for exp, however, when I left I don't think I was quite able to solo it. Same with a lot of the other exp suggestions. Most of them assume 3/400 stats, however I think only maybe one or two of my characters break 200. 

Therefore, but I don't want to spend the next week leveling to 74 in Glitter Hard.

I hit my last straw last night. I was playing online with my best friend, I'm setting up towers on my Countess (I DPS my Huntress) while said friend is placing some traps with the Ranger. We always switch over before the wave is done because these characters are NOT built for DPS at all on our games. This guy sees we have an entire side of our map unguarded, hits the crystal, then leaves. He comes back in to watch after the wave starts. 

I kicked him so he couldn't do it again after the wave was over (since we were scrambling to guard the other two crystals during). Next, either.

After that, and this kid flips out and tells us to shut up, blah blah blah. 

We didn't get one decent player in, I hate that this community is just as muddled with trolls as DOTA and games of similar popularity.

Try the Shards map on Hard or Insane. There is already Mythical Loot and the pets on wave 15 survival can be Transcendend.

The Heroes you should focus on equiping for building are:

**Huntress** - mainly for gas traps but also for inferno traps

**EV** - buff beams and physical beams

**Monk** - a Nightmare build will have Ensnare

**Summoner** - summoned Minions will provide singel target dps.

Recomended are also:

**Huntress** or **EV** with dps/resi gear and a genie to provide mana for upgrades

**Monk** in dps/resi/ability focused gear for the time when everything is upped to max. pick a dps pet to provide additional dps together with your Tower/Hero Boost

As I understand it

So, are other pets even worth consideration?

I mean

Guardians - for Tower Hugging Ranged
Genie - For early wave mana upgrading. Not to be used later - monster mana is sufficient. I question its use with the cube around
Fairy - For multiple melee if part of your setup involves a ""melee pit"" so that you can devote more defenses elsewhere. Better used in pairs. See above
Dragon - the premiere AOE damage pet if you've got huntress traps around. Better for ranged damage than Robot/Animus because AOEs tend to hit more clustered around a character in combat.
Laser Robot/Animus - the premiere ranged damage pet if you DON'T have huntress traps around, fire.
Steam Robot - the ""bodyguard"" pet with huge knockback
Giraffe - Pure builder who is logged off only.

I dunno. Those seem like the only pets worth anything, but why not just use a dragon for AOE? Same with the Chinese Dragons. All the other melee pets don't really seem to have a candle to hold to the Steam Robot.

So anyhow. Seeking thoughts. Seems like these days, Cupid, or maaaaybe Steam Robot. I question the use of anything else.
