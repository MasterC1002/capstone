However

* Rich kids: We're starting to pick up on this one thanks to a recent /r/frugal post. This offender has lived a blessed life, utilities, cell phone, and their luxury car payment. They extoll the virtues of their ascetic lifestyle which is completely subsidized by their parents. If untreated, they risk growing up into.

* Wi-Fi Stealing Millionaire, yet most untouched. I think because it's difficult character to play. A rich person who is convinced they're poor. It's also hard to call them out since we don't know all of their situation, but they show up if you know where to look. Scroll to the bottom of any thread on cutting utility costs and there they are. From a lead engineer who turns off his fridge at night (saves about a dollar a year), to the renter in a 400 sq ft studio who roasts in his 90F deg apartment so they can save $20 a month despite potential health risks. These are people who clearly have means, but prefer to suffer in exchange for very very little.

* The Craftsman: Akin to the WiFi Stealing Millionaire, but still trash. The milk jug turned into a lousy watering can comes to mind. Not understanding efficiency, they don't realize that most products are made for us so we can worry about other things, like spending time with friends or family. 

* The Fraudster: This one shows up once in a while, they are obstinate in their defense of it. These show up in uncomfortable threads about ""worst thing you've ever done for frugality"" or the like. A great example is the meat packaging thread we had a week or two ago. These people bring in coupons from other stores, and then throw a fit when policy doesn't let them return the hammer they bought at Lowes at Home Depot. They put hair on their food to avoid paying the bill. A thousand little sins to avoid paying, and then blame the establishment for trying to take their money for a service or product.

* Captain No Friends: This one's easy. They offer sweeping, they have no idea about you or your values, but are only happy to tell you about how they're ruining your life. Granted many people have bad habits, but often the advice is made regardless of the individual's specific circumstances.

I'm open to other ideas

Let's step up our game.

1360007012.0,17vsty,The Frugalist's Guide to Becoming a Fat Cat,lentil_king,55,5,9,"I’m going to get right into it. The path to becoming a fat cat starts with growing lentils. 


**Starting a Lentil Farm**

The first thing you’re going to want to do is steal a handful of lentils. Bulk Barn is my store of choice. They’re usually understaffed and have no cameras. Choose brown or red lentils
 
Since true frugalists don’t own anything, preferably right over the graves for maximum plant food.

When the time comes, commit a petty crime that lands you in jail for the next six months. 


**Lentils as Currency**

When you get out of prison
 
As you can already see


**The Help**

Split your crew into two groups: the first group will be construction. Get them to build you a shelter for the winter. The second group will be focused on growing more lentils.  

While the cemetery provides enough lentils for a small group, tell them these are special herbs that keep pests away. Now you’ve got a lentil crop hiding in plain sight and real money! 

Now that you’ve got a shelter and an upcoming lentil crop, who provide body heat in the winter, free labor in the growing season, and meat when they perish.

To lure the homeless, until they’re afraid to leave.

It’s now time to hunker down for the harsh winter. Get the homeless people to sleep in the inner perimeter of your shelter, until balance is restored.


**Expanding Your Operation**

You should now be entering your third growing season. You’re living with a group of frugalites and homeless people

Land can be acquired in one of three ways:

1.	The Fat Cat Method – contact a local real estate agency

2.	The Frugal Method – get to know local growers

3.	The Frugal_Jerk Method – find a suitable piece of land

Next, and the meat of their fallen comrades since the previous growing season, meaning they’re fit and ready for action. Have your DIY crew build a plow and use your homeless crew in place of oxen. 

At this point

Your homeless crew will now be eating the weeds picked from your lentil fields. Depending on how clean the field has been kept in the past, and foraged roots.
 

**Reaching Fat Cat Status**

You’re now selling into the global lentil market. Lentil prices don’t matter, and seed is free. With a 100% profit margin, you can now watch your fiscal rewards pile up. As long as the colony is fed a steady diet of lentils, rainwater, and fear of the outside world, you will continue to reap the benefits of your hard work and innovation.

At this point

Of course

However

The last time I changed my motor oil

Well anyways what I end up doing is just skimming a bit of the oil off the top with a used coffee filter and then wiping it all over the insides of my four new exterior trash cans.  This allows the trash to slide right out into the curbside bin on trash day.  Now if this is where I had stopped

I take the trash out on Wednesday nights, go outside and see that nature, or in this case, gravity, has done its thing.  I remove the plug and let that corner oil trickle into an old glass mayonnaise jar can I inherited from my grandfather (the king of frugal btw).  Back into the barrel it goes and now I've been able to sustain on just the original deposit since I began harvesting about 8 months ago.^(3)

1. I don't like cold sandwich meat

2. My thighs rub together.

If any of you guys/gals feel like I do, leave your meat separate.  I recommend ham as it smells good and is not costly.

Now, I'll slip the ham slices down the front of my pants, placing them between my thighs.  I'll make sure they aren't bunched, as that can lead to further chafing.  Next, I'll squirt a bit of mayonnaise or honey mustard through a split in my zipper for flavor.  Much like Shake-n-Bake, I'll go for a brisk walk through the building, mushing up all the lunchables in my crotch basket.  Sandy, loves ""my cologne""- her father is a retired deli owner.

Since I stumbled upon r/frugal, with my boyfriend. We liked the area, and the price was right. As well as we were taking over the lease for his elderly father so it worked out well.

We bought a couch with our tax return instead of dumpster diving for a half broken one with two cushions and covered in blood and semen stains after being used as a dumping ground in a crack whore's squat house. Mistake mistake. But... We do love the couch and have since smartened up.

We both work minimum wage, but a quick YouTube video taught my boyfriend. Toilet paper is dirt cheap now that we make our own, and fresh fruit is awesome now that I've learned to just take it from someone's private orchard and be lucky enough to be in a place where fruit just grows everywhere. Obviously everywhere has this!

Then I realize the apartment needed a good clean. You guys suggested vinegar and bleach. Well damn. I was concerned about all those *chemicals* so I just used water I saved in a rain bucket out back. Clean apartment for nothing :)

I then started getting in the frugal mood. Finding ways to cut out dollars at a time. Laundry was our big change eater. $1.75 for a wash and $1.75x2 for a dry (the dryer is half the size and needs two runs). So I made a drying rack out of twine and used car parts I found in the alleyway. $1 and has saved us that within just one day! I don't have a living room anymore because the room is taken up by string and metal

I started unplugging everything we didn't need plugged in 24/7. Unsure how much it saves. But it makes us think twice before using the microwave or lights or the A/C. I don't think I've used any of them in months. It gets a bit dark at night

Cut the cord! No more Bell Aliant! Found an old Windows 95 desktop on sale for $10 at Goodwill and hooked it up to our living room tv. We play solitaire, and barely used it. Now we have shows we follow, and more gaming power! 

We got a kitten. Called around and found the cheapest vet, they pay for food and litter, and this way we didn't have to buy a second cat as a companion for our terribly hyper kitten. Win win. Pretty soon we'll have enough to make a delicious stew! We reuse their feces and urine as fertilizer for our organic garden with seeds we found in the forest.

Next up was to issue the flow of money. We were poor every week after paycheck and couldn't figure out why. I built a spread sheet (on that awesome new desktop!) and now we have $500 a month to pay off debt. Meaning come the new year,000 each, helpfully getting us to our minimum wage jobs. We will be using the snow ball effect though, so hopefully it won't take 12 years to pay off my student loan (as the government predicted).

I was paying $260 a month in cabs, that clearly costs money and was out of the question. Instead we found bicycles and plan on strapping baby seats to them when the time arises. 

I'm so grateful r/frugal. You have truly changed our lifestyles, and stopped buying daily ""treats"" and started thinking long term. No more coffees and fast food! And snacks... My boyfriend was the worst for buying daily snacks at work.

Now I make snacks that fit it a 1 cup mason jar. Rice, ramen, and all the free fruit that just drops off trees! Rice &amp; beans in jars. Whatever. It's easy for him to grab and it lasts in his bag all day (works security).",,False,self,t5_2vdcr,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal_Jerk/comments/1213ra/what_rfrugal_has_taught_me_and_done_for_me/

------
###Shelter / Housing
------

Mortgage and rent is an expense that many fatcats unnecessarily pay. You can easily create your own shelter instead of paying extortionate amounts to have one built for you.

LAND - Run to your nearest park or land area that has the least rangers and very little people around. This is vital in not getting caught.

GATHERING MATERIALS - Most department stores have axes

Next


BUILDING - Build a tall cube or rectangular prism to a size of your liking. A rectangle can be cut through the wood for your door. A pile of hay will suffice as a bed.

----
###Food
----
You have 2 options when it comes to food.

###Farming

TOOLS - hoe and lentil seeds which can be found at nearest department store. Borrow them from the store. 

PROCESS - Till area. Plant seeds. Wait for FREE lentils to grow.

FOODS - Lentil soup

###Persistence Hunting

TOOLS - Stick with rock at the end

PROCESS - Search the area for animals like deer. Once you have found one


FOODS - Serve fresh / after killed

----
###Entertainment
----

Your entertainment and joy should come from knowing that you beat the fatcat lifestyle and are now frugal. Conventional methods like kicking a rock around result in too much calorie expenditure

----
###Staying Cool
----

Stay at the local library during daylight hours. It will be extremely cool and you won't be releasing so much energy through sweat. Many calories are saved through this.

----
###Internet
----

Local library.

----
###Clothing
----

Hide from animals works very well as clothing. Be sure to wash it in a lake or river beforehand.
