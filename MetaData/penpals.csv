I would prefer to do all of this via email rather than snail mail. 

My students are: age 19-22, 90% are female, 10% male, they are very interested in Western culture, movies, TV, etc.

You should be 20 - 40 years old (Outside this range is not a huge problem but it is better if the students can relate to you), pics of family, your home, car, pets, workplace etc. NOT YOUR DICK. 

Please note, or if you cannot maintain this commitment for less than 5 months (the duration of the semester). 

All mail both ways will go through me and I will edit anything I think is uncouth, not to create an international incident, or a dispute between me and my employers. If this is something you would be interested in, please contact me through this thread or via PM. I look forward to hearing from you!  
EDIT: Amazing response so far! Thanks so much! So I will let you all know what I am doing. I have sent PMs to those who have expressed an interest. I can accommodate about 12 now for my 2 writing classes, and possibly more before October. That would enable me to put the students into groups of 5. If there is much more interest I could make it groups of 4, or even 3 (though that would see me doing a lot of work). Anyway, we shall see...  
RE-EDIT: Wow! Awesome response. I have no received interest from about 15 people, asking for a fairly quick response - I want a 100 or so word introduction letter. The first 12 I receive will be distributed to students next week. The next 6 (possibly more), I will distribute in a few weeks when my freshman class begins (they are doing their military training now, poor things). Any further responses, I will do my best to find a correspondent for you. Maybe I can set you up with some of the more gifted students, or see if one of my colleagues would be interested in setting up a similar program. Cheers!  
3rd edit: Wow, I will look at dividing the class into pairs or trios and giving a letter to each. I have already received 6 or 7 letters and I think the students will have a lot of fun and learn a lot about western culture. I am sure they have never heard of disc golf!
4th Edit: I have assigned 10 of you to one of my classes. The next class is advanced so I will make the groups smaller. I think I can find penpals for 14 or 15 of you. I have another writing class starting next week which I can assign 10 more people to. The bad news is that I have received more than 50 letters so some will miss out. I will however, thank you all so much for your submissions.

**The most popular country was the United States (surprise, know that we received many responses from people in other countries. Just to list a few: France, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Venezuela, Portugal, and Australia. 

**The most popular method of communicating with penpals was snail mail (letters)

As I said above

* One of the biggest complaints was that there is a gender gap here and that submissions by women receive far more attention than submissions by men. While it is true that there are more men than women, but I think that most people would prefer a comment. It's really nice to read that someone is interested, even if it's a short comment, and it helps a lot to improve morale.

* In the future, but I would really appreciate it if you all did. 

* Another common complaint is that people seem to have really poor follow through. You'll correspond once or twice, make a post, and then don't take it seriously at all. I don't mean to be the ""fun police"", but it's quite rude to start being someone's penpal and then suddenly stop. 

* Please make sure to direct all submissions that have to do with sex or seeking relationships to the proper subreddit. We're here strictly for *platonic* penpals. If you want to find someone to date

And finally, so don't fear reporting/PMing the mods. 

I hope you all enjoyed taking the survey as much as I did writing it and reading your responses.

**Edit 2: I've had a few pm's suggesting a subreddit for this sort of penpal exchange. Therefore I've created /r/anonymouspals. However I'm not sure how it would exactly work

This is quite a specific request as it would most likely only work with someone like minded.

The idea would be to e-mail each other anonymously maybe once a week/fortnight. The catch will be that the e-mails we send will be our own

Why this sort of penpal specifically? Well I think in normal circumstances you can often speak your mind or tell your story to family/friends/strangers. However I think naturally people perceive this as something that needs to be reciprocated, your feelings, anything; essentially be able to tell your story without fear of prejudice, judgement or simply having the comfort of knowing you're being listened to without fear of reply. Your reasons are your own.

If you answered ´yes´ to any of the above questions

Firstly, because you, my friend are worth it.) 

I´m pleased to inform you of this very special one of a lifetime risk-free opportunity, expect for than one time when... Anyway, think of it as ´The Breakfast Club´ with the exception of meeting in the detention on Saturday morning and we´re three people short from five. But we are total strangers, getting acquainted for the first time and hopefully becoming friends. 

If I happened to pique your curiosity, I´m not made of sugar and spice and everything nice.  I am from Estonia, it´s a state in the Baltic region. I was born during the year when my country regained independence in 1991. This means I´m 21-year-old young adult. During the daytime I´m your ordinary university student and when night-time rolls around I´m your sleep deprived grave-yard shift worker.

Anyway, then leave a comment or PM me. There are not many things in life I can promise, but I can guarantee you my friendship and letters to be found in your mailbox until you are interested. If you like literature (genre doesn´t matter), find history fascinating, aren´t embarrassed to let yourself loose, talk about total nonsense or like to divulge into the matters of life and death then we are the perfect match.

From ~~your~~ your future friend

**NB:** I dare you to write me! I dare you. 

**EDIT:** 
When I was all smiles and dimples, why do you have to be such a sweetie pie. “* Only once did she tower above me in all her five feet ten inch glory, red-faced from anger, screeching like a banshee, making me quiver like a leaf, demanding me why I had to have a magpie syndrome. I remember this childhood event like it had happened yesterday. It was the first and last time she ever screamed at me. Freddy Krueger himself would have probably quivered under my mother’s wrath and wept like a newborn baby.

You are probably wondering why I am telling you this.  You see, perhaps one or three response. I had low expectations. That´s why I only a couple of hours ago decided to check my Reddit´s account. It´s understatement to say that I was overwhelmed by the warm welcoming I received from all of you. 

Everything I wrote came from bottom of my heart. The truth is that even thou I would love to keep up correspondence with every one of you I don´t have the financial means to buy so many stamps and pay for all the overseas mail. I have watched for the last hour my computer screen

Right now I need to go to school, you all seem lovely people and I wish that in some alternative universe I would get to know you all. As a magpie, I hate saying no, especially to people.

You are all lovely!
I wish you all good luck!

And so

My tale begins in Idaho,b,g,b,g,B &lt;-- me!). There is a 6 year gap between me and my next sibling, so I grew up mostly entertaining myself. I was always a curious kid. I spent almost every day outside catching bugs or breaking open rocks. That curiosity extended into my school years

The problem was I was also a nerd. I parted my hair sideways untill the 8th grade and never really had many friends. Actually when I say ""not many"" thats just a euphemism for zero, I enjoyed the last 3 years of high school and my freshman year of college. 

Now, so this was something I always planned to do, and I did in fact do it. I served in the Washington DC area, and became fluent in Spanish.

 This is where things get complicated though. As I was out there, kind, and interesting people. Many of these people were in all honesty happier with life than I think I ever will be. I saw that rather than me being the one with something to offer the world, I had so much more to learn from everyone around me. I saw that no matter what ethnic or religious background a person had, they seemed to have equal potential to be awesome. I'm sure that's probably very obvious to you, but for me growing up, I was always taught that happines was directly related to one's faith and obedience to the principles of religion. Intrigued by this

Fast forward again, neuroscience, and any and all studies relating to the impact of religion on human behavior. After about a year. I started to feel that when people judge others based on religious differences, its sort of like two people hating each other because they couldn't agree if Wolverine wears boxers or briefs. It's ultimately irrelavant to a person's character, and can't be proven either way. These views led me to give up religion entirely. 

Now it all ties together. Deciding to abandon my faith caused a huge backlash in my life. It basically destroyed almost every significant relationship I had, trying to evade capture by blending into the background and keeping a pebble in my shoe to remind me to fake a limp. I felt like if anybody knew that I didn't believe what the vast majority of those around me did, that I would be completely rejected. As a defense mechanism, I just started to withdraw from people. I buried myself in my studies and became almost robotic in my relationships with others. I was all business. If I was with students, I talked about assignments, grades, projects, I just put in my headphones and worked. No chit-chat

Now here I am. Having lived like this for about a year. I have successfully isolated myself, but I desperately need to find a way to connect with people again. To those of you who read this, I've actually never told my story start to finish to anybody, so whether you've met me or not, you know me better than my own family, and I consider you my friends.

The point: Prove to me that the world is still full of awesome people. Tell me your stories

I was a little worried that if I were to write my little introduction like this that it would end up as just a list of likes (I like ice cream) and then I would get a response from someone saying 'I like ice cream too' and then I would say 'oh' and they would say 'do you like vanilla' and I would say 'kinda' and they would say 'oh' and I would say 'oh'

What I will say is that I like lots of things. I like to read, I love to write. It's a powerful way to beam yourself inside someone's mind and hopefully find a comfortable home there. I like movies, although I have this awful problem where I stop watching a movie partway, even if I'm enjoying it, just because I can't really share it with others. So I haven't seen as many movies as I would like, but I'd love to take recommendations from others and talk about them. 

I love music, Foals, The Postal Service and various post-rocky things I really like. I enjoy acting and video games (Ace Attorney, Persona, Kingdom Hearts, Sam and Max) too. Although if you don't know or don't like any of those things, that's fine. Above all I'm looking for long, possibly-strange conversations

* Yes, movies and all the rest of it. I'm beginning to realise that this post is becoming pretty long so I won't elaborate on them until asked. Avid PC gamer too. I'm horrible at art.

Maybe another Filipino has the same hopes for their Lolo/Lola...,SocialSoundSystem,22,1,3,"My Lola is 88 years old. She's been going through some stuff and I gave her a call tonight. I had a 45 minute call with her today and she really opened up when we started talking about the Philippines. My mom says that her doctor says that she needs a friend to communicate with and perhaps a Filipino friend would help. 

I think she grew up in Laguna province but also spent a great deal of time in Manila where her father was a lawyer with his practice above his hardware store. During WWII and the Japanese occupation she worked with the guerillas &amp; other subversive forces delivering messages. After the war she went back to university to become a teacher &amp; professor. During Marcos' rule they began to move the family to the US where she became a teacher in Los Angeles eventually moving the whole family here with the hopes of a better life.

She now lives in San Diego (Oceanside), who she can talk with or relate too. I talked with her on the phone for 45 minutes tonight... At first she wasn't really coherent but as we started talking about the big family reunion she had yesterday, her brothers &amp; sisters, and about life in the Philippines she really started to open up. 

Apparently she has already written her entire life story but she can't remember it now. But as soon as I started talking about her past

Maybe another Filipino grandchild has the same hopes for their Lolo/Lola... Worth a shot. In other news

I'm on the other end of the phone when you yell and cry that I ruined your Christmas and all I can ever think of when I hear you bitch and moan is telling you ""I WISH I could fucking see my family for just one holiday.""

Hi there
First, just in case you didn't know). I'm in college, second year studying naval electronic engineering (i hope that's how it's called in english). I enjoy listening to old rock bands (there's no need to name them, if you're into it you allready know what i'm talking about) but i'm not against new ones either. As for movies, horror and sci-fi ar my favourites but that doesn't stop me from enjoying any other good movies. I even started to watch Korean and other Asian dramas. It's crazy, i know, but that's me. Well

I'm looking for 2 maybe 3 penpals. I prefer them to be female (no offence dudes) because even if i understand ''male language'' (few words, creepy or any other stuff that we both don't agree. I just want someone to talk to, find out more about them, their culture, the country they live in and things like that. I wish i could find someone from Asia, someone from America (not just the country) and Africa (in fact, from any country that ain't mine, ok

I know this is a fresh account but please don't find it as an obstacle on the road our future pen-friendship. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Please leave a comment with a few words.

This sounds a little unreal

I've been bipolar since I was 10. I deal with it really well, it is a huge part of my identity, because I experience it and 
deal with it (mostly in positive ways!) everyday. I resist heavy medication and am a pretty 
huge advocate for bipolar self awareness and alternative therapys as a compliment to medication and traditional talk therapy. 

I love movies and comic books

I use various substances recreationally. I believe I'm not addicted to any one of them because I'm pretty honest with my therapists about my usage, to see things differently and to experience things. 

My other guilty pleasure is mysterious things -- especially those rooted in antiquity or that are just truly bizarre. I like weird things because they stimulate my brain and that's not something that I get to experience very often these days. 

I currently live with my boyfriend and his family. I have a three year old daughter I lost in a custody thing when I was homeless, I'm a house-girlfriend. I kind of hate it but, again, wicked bad PTSD.
  

I'm looking for people who are a little unique as well; people who feel misunderstood and have minds full of -stuff- they just want to share and delight in having stuff shared with them. I'm looking for someone who is interested in sharing and caring about one another -- I'm looking for someone who knows what its like to be judged, we'll be great friends.

I've tried a couple of these in the past. Two never responded at all and one did for a while but hasn't for several months.

A little about me; I have written as a Freelance Writer for PC Gamer Magazine, Chemistry, Physics and Computing at College with hopes to join a start-up as a programmer and I live in Oxford, UK.  

In my spare time I play Magic: The Gathering, cycle around the countryside and plan dream trips around the world. I am extrememly geeky but that is no bad thing as I struggle to find something I have zero interest in at all. 

I should mention that I am looking to write to a female. As my Penpal
and I struggle to be this open around guys. I'm more than happy to do International post! 

What you should expect from me:

* Several-thousand word letters
* Quick responses
* Will always email/message to let you know I have sent or received. 
* Lots of interesting trinkets
* A custom-CD every few letters with what I currently listen to. 
* I will be completely honest with you and will not hide any of my flaws.

What I expect from you:

* Reasonably long letters (not several-thousand but not something super short)
* Commitment and Effort into producing something lovely (I don't mind if it's not quite as bulky as mine as long as it isn't rushed)
* Emails / messages to let me know when you've sent and received. I don't expect super-swift replies but as long as you let me know if there will be a major delay.
* A long lasting correspondance.
 
I know this seems way more formal than most posts on here but because of the amount of effort I've put into producing letters in the past

1339060723.0,upjhd,Seeking fellow wordsmith; there is no TL;DR.,FountainPenFrederick,18,5,9,"My name is not Frederick.

.

Many years ago, polished from some dark majestic tree the world no longer has enough of and finished with a sterling finger clasp. My name had been pyrographed into the top and I remember tracing my fingers from the first letter into the last before peering inside.

.

""Picked out a name for him already?"" she said

.

At the time, listening to the click-clack of the rails as we skated past mountain after mountain, watching this pen dance across page after page, I discovered a personality between my fingertips. A personality with impatient wisdom and the young ability to paint emotion onto a greyscale canvas. A personality deserving of a name.

.

In hours turned to minutes, others were a playground of signatures, markedly improving down the paper as the pen said ""no, do it this way"" with increasing earnest.

.

Out of paper and unwilling to wake my friend from her much needed rest, not even stopping for lunch as the train rolled through Austria and into Italy. Soon after crossing the border, my friend woke up, stretching through a smile as she watched my hands help the pen fill his reservoir from its nearly empty starter bottle.

.

""What are these?"" she said

.

Despite my pleas of ""it's not finished"", stopping every so often to laugh or to ask for a word where the pen and I had fought over how to write the letter ""G"". Or to wipe away soggy eyes and kiss me. Her reaction was not a testament to the writing's quality but perhaps a reaction to the writing having been written for her, to her, with her.

.

She had not finished when the train steward came by to announce our arrival into Verona. During our conversation

.

My friend and I spent the next summer months travelling through Italy

.

Our relationship began in spring on a train ride to London, having pushed through the grief to find a writing career, a university degree, and a woman I love as fiercely as she does me.

.

I've had many fountain pens since Frederick, and I carry a half dozen disposable buddies all named Pip to give to friends not yet introduced to the society of fountain ink.

.

Frederick and I never finished the first novel, satisfied with the task of scribbling lecture notes, but we both miss the patience and care afforded by letter craft. 

.

If you've a passion for the English language and telling stories from your life, past or desired travel, and philosophy from experience come to mind. We can swap stories; between travel, a frustrating-but-often-fantastic/hilarious sleep disorder, and a proclivity for trouble and risk, I've plenty to share. Really, anything you like!

As I won’t be relieving those people’s usernames who only responded via PM then I named them with the term “anonymous” in my list.

I was recently blown away by the generosity of the people of Reddit when I put out a call for birthday cards for my fiance on a few subreddits ... and the number of people who immediately put their hands up and were happy to help was amazing (and it made her cry - in a good way - that so many people she never met would take the time to wish her a happy birthday)

The reaction to both of these : My post on /r/PenPals and My post on /r/RandomKindness was beyond what I could have dreamed ...

But now I come to the hard bit .... Recently one of my good friends found out that his brother has cancer of the liver and has spread to three different parts of his spine. One of his vertebrae collapsed due to this and now on top of it all he has a fractured spine.

All his life my friend has devoted his time to being there for his brother as he has been in and out of hospital since he was born with ongoing heart issues.

My friend Doug explains the situation much better than me ... http://youtu.be/gZbgdh9iTOQ

and if you do feel like donating something the website is http://www.mycause.com.au/page/friendinneed

I am asking if people can send ""Thinking of You"" or ""Get Well"" cards ... that kind of thing ... something to surprise them with ... something to make his family smile ....

1336927200.0,tl403,Posting again with a likely TL;DR inside..,,16,2,3,"Basic facts first I suppose. I'm 20 and female and I'm from Colorado/US. I'll tell you my name later if you decide to message me. 

* I'm currently a sophomore in college going for an Associates of Applied Science in Cosmetology. So yes, and skin. I graduate next Spring. I'm currently an honors student with a 3.7 GPA and yes I have had to take English, Math, Science and Humanities classes for my degree. After I graduate I actually plan on working somewhere like a convenience store for awhile before pursuing my career.  For my career I would love to work in theater doing hair and makeup, specifically fancy fantasy and scifi stuff and I would love to do nails on the side. Two dreams of mine are either being able to work on Broadway or opening up an 'alternative' fashion boutique and maybe offering some salon services there. 

* I live at home with my mom and my dad. I have one older brother who is married and has a 2 year old son. They live on the East Coast. I have other family

* So here's some other shit now. 
I love music and I basically listen to just about everything or I will at least listen to it once and decide if I like it or not. I've grown out of the whole bashing music thing but there are still some things that I cannot stand. I do mostly listen to rock and the bazillion subgenres within. 

* I am a damn movie buff. I have see well over 300 movies in my life and there are so many more that I need and want to see. I watch b/w classics on TCM, but I've still seen quite a few. I also love Tim Burton, Disney, Hayao Miyazaki and so many others. 

* I read a lot, scifi, and romance and usually I read books that have all three. I currently own over 30 books and most of them I still need to read. Hopefully I'll have time when I'm done with my summer semester. 

* And of course TV. I watch a lot of stuff on Science, History, National Geographic, I basically love learning about stuff. I LOVE paranormal shows, but the only ghost hunting show I watch is Ghosthunters. Other shows I watch are The Walking Dead, Family Guy, American Dad, Grimm, Top Gear, and probably a few others. 
I love art and tattoos and piercings. I love vintage things as well. Most anything Japanese I like. I'm also really into Gothic everything pretty much but I won't call myself Gothic because I will get yelled at for a variety of reasons. I love animals and have both cats and dogs. I like to collect things, take photos, blog and all that good stuff. 

* And something else you should know about me. 
I'm lonely and alone. I suffer from depression and I am medicated for it, intelligent, funny, attractive..anything. I feel worthless quite often and yes, I've had suicidal thoughts before. I had GoneWild and GoneWildPlus posts, but I took them down because I feel like they weren't doing any good, probably more so damaging. 
But I care about others...a lot. I listen and learn and try to be there and help as much as I can. But sometimes I can't. Sometimes its too much for me and I get sad that I cant be a better friend. 

* So this is me. If you're still here and somehow still interested let me know. I love talking to people. I'd like to start with either talking here or through email/IM before moving to texting or something because I feel like you cant really get to know someone a lot through texting.

I'm not 'a writer' or even much of a storyteller, nice acoustics...but it gets a little lonely. Anyways, just today, I thought to myself, ""Hey. I should share what I have to say with other people. I should start writing!"" And I replied, ""Hell yeah, man! That's an f-ing great idea. All you've gotta do is just get off your ass and actually do something for once."" Good point

Right. So, I would like to work on a different piece of writing every week: a short story, essay, poem, whatever. This piece of writing will be based on a word or theme suggested by one of you guys. When I am done, I will send the person who gave me the theme a handwritten copy of my work in the mail all pretty and old-fashioned-like for you to keep! In exchange, I ask just one thing: send me a reply! It can be anything from your thoughts, critiques

I don't care how many people sign up for this. I promise to write every single one of these stories. It might sound crazy, help me out and be the final push and inspiration I need!

Here's a more well-organized version of how I'm imagining this will work out:

**Step 1:** You think to yourself

**Step 2:** Comment with a word or phrase you want me to write about.

**Step 3:** I gather all the comments and people and arrange them into a to-do list with a different person every week.

**Step 4:** When I get to your suggestion (which may be a few weeks down the line)

**Step 5:** Pester me. PM me things like ""Hey

**Step 6:** Receive letter from me. Read it while relaxing in your favorite armchair

**Step 7:** Write a response to me and send it my way (snail mail or virtually

**Step 8:** Bask in my radiant gratitude!

I'm looking for someone who wants to **share secrets and inner thoughts**, or some people, who want to **trade doodles, snippets of writing, books... whatever!** in addition to letters. I'd love to hear about your day-to-day life, wherever you're from!

I can kind of **speak French** but it's been a while since I've had any practice.

**Interests

I love reading

I got through high school by analyzing literature (need Shakespeare help?) and doing AP Physics practice problems. 

I graduated early from high school so I've been out of high school for a year- thank GAWD. I was a Virginia Tech but now I'm going to my local community college. 

I'm planning on transferring

I love music. I play **trumpet, and now banjo** as well as composing (not very well). My favorite bands are all over the place but I truly love **the Pixies and Leonard Cohen. And Acid Mothers Temple.** Pretty much, ask me a genre and I'll tell you who or what I like. 

And back to art... I really enjoy drawing though I'm not particularly skilled. I can send you some pictures of my more recent work if you want

I'm also working on creative writing so if you want papers covered in lines that aren't quite write or napkins with a couple of words on it

I like science-fiction a lot! I'm a massive **Doctor Who fan** (I love the old stuff and the new) and might fan girl out on you. I also love Star Wars and I'm recently getting into Star Trek. 

I'll send a letter to anyone who wants one and we'll see how it goes from there! **I don't care how old or young you are** but I should warn you that I've been told **I have the soul of a sixty-year-old man.** Jewish too but I'm not sure where that came from. Really

If you want

Hopefully I've told you enough so you can decide if you want to talk or not. There's a lot more to me than just this!

**TL;DR** Just check what's bolded. Although

I'm an extremely extroverted person. What that means is not that I'm an overtly obnoxious idiot who talks about bullshit, but I also **love** listening to people.

I talk Finnish

I'm a movie-geek! I watch movies almost every day. Classics, everything! I love Kubrick, Coen brothers, Nolan, you know the cliché movie geek's favourites. Favourite movie has to be Dr. Strangelove. I've seen it over ten times and I could talk about it for days!

I listen to a *lot* of music. And I listen to everything. House, punk, some rap, some country, some jazz, blues...

Sadly I can't enjoy reading a book. I **can't** concentrate on reading a book. I've read the Hobbit but that took a month of about ten-twenty minute-sprees of reading. So sorry. Maybe you could help me with this?

I love traveling. My biggest dream, I cycle, go to the gym, swim in a nearby lake and so on. I love the nature and am a bit of a hippie.

Sometimes I dance with Lady Lucy

I also like doodling and drawing portraits!

I'd like to share anything and everything with my penpal. Secrets, music, doodles, whatever! Whatever you want to share go ahead and share.

My humour is a bit dark and/or dry. If you know Finnish humour you know my humour.

I hope that's enough info to get you interested. If I seem to be a prick or something it might be because I'm tired (it's one in the am) So yeah

I want you to do this with me.

Are you like me? Ever look at something and go ""Wow that sounds amazing but it's not something I think I could ever do?"" LET'S STOP DOING THIS WITH EACH OTHER.

I want to make a list of all the things I see that I think sound fun but I'm too nervous, or insecure to try, and I want you to do the same. I want to mail these lists to each other, and then I want us to start doing the things on these lists, sending pictures to each other as we accomplish them. You don't have to do them by yourself: bring a friend! A family member! Let's not set out on this venture by ourselves!

It can be big things like bungee jumping or white water rafting, or finally making use of the photo booth at your mall. The list can be long or short, and yeah there probably will be things that neither of us accomplish -- that's totally fine. No shame! We're not superheros, you guys. Just people working to broaden their worldviews a little. And we only try them at our own pace; I'm not going to say you MUST try something at least once a week or even once a month... that's not fair.

We can write each other about our fears, and just listen to each other ramble about what we did. I will never judge you for backing out of an attempt, and never judge you for what you want to do. I expect the same level of respect! You can do these scary things, knowing that even if you embarrass yourself in front of people, you can always come back to me and I will not like you any less.

So, gender, location, it doesn't matter here. We're all equally capable of being socially awkward and we're also all capable of overcoming this (I hope! haha).

First of all, though both my parents are from a different country. As many people who share multiple cultural roots, I've grown up with a slight distance to my adoptive country's culture and am pretty sure that gives me the ability today to act as some kind of bridge between French culture and other ones, and that is something I would like to share with anyone who would be interested in ""discussing"" France without facing too much unconstructive chauvinism. 
Also, so, fire away!)

The second one is, to discuss some important matters with people who don't share my culture. I've been recently sensing that my life history, where I grew up, who I met, everything which makes me ""me"" in general, act as restrictions about how I see things (seems obvious, right?).

I've learned to hide my true self from those around me so I can blend in and function in my job and school and ""social life"", but it leaves the real me being lonely. But I'd like to share my true self with someone... someone who doesn't know me in reality and can't hold things against me, of course!

If you've gotten this far and you're still willing to talk, but it was before...), and you can tell me anything without disturbing me. Not that any conversation has to be centered around that. I'm open to anything... story telling, recaps of your daily experiences, even straight-up bullshitting if it's interesting. I don't know if anything will come of this or what the experience will be like, but if you're willing to talk, so am I.

I'm a very introverted and whimsical person who has absolutely no idea what he wants to do with his life and spends more time analyzing whether or not his every action will be meaningful/worthwhile to him in the longterm than he does actually acting on those actions.

I don't want to ramble too much about myself here since there's plenty of time for that later on, fiction and writing are my primary interests. Escapism of most any kind - senses of being in particular places and times, whether it's through the painted backgrounds of old cartoons or fiction, there's this powerfully compelling sense of ""presence"" and desire for that sense of a world as it has been and would always be that garners my most emotive appreciations. If you catch me in the right mood, I love long, meandering conversations with people about philosophy, ramblings about inconsequential observations

I'm also a country kind of a person, woodworking and other miscellaneous things like that - although I sadly rarely have the time/resources to do them often. I love reading and learning things hands-on rather than idly in the classroom. I love oldies and indie rock, as well as some random genres like celtic music. I don't understand why it's so hard to find jazz-rock these days.

As a person who's always interested in adventure, culture and anquity, I feel disillusioned with what I perceive to be the cold and culturally bland time period we live in. I love the physicality of writing letters, cobbling together journals and scrapbooks, the like - and would love to make some pen pals in the hopes of making some genuinely substantive conversations and connections with people.

Germany and Austria are planned for summer '13.

* Art

* Architecture - Detroit has *beautiful* architecture. I'd like to learn more about the history of the buildings; I'll include my findings in my letters too! (If you're interested)

Plenty more

* I'm at a bit of a crossroads with what I'd like to do with myself. Nursing?

* As time passes

* Music is a constant in my life. My spare time is often spent messing about with various acoustic stringed instruments.

* Most days

* Give me English comedians like Ricky Gervais

* I'm toying around with learning a bit of Bulgarian.

* Ask me about anything else. I'm fairly open.

Let us delve deep into one another's mind, conscience, and touch at that deep yearning for human contact. Let us uncover the human condition.",Mythodiir,13,3, or well, which is coming right around the corner. 

I'm deeply infatuated with history and I make a thing out of contextualizing. Personally, and I try not to seem as such, but for a Canadian I am peculiarly knowledgeable of that dingy Island to the east. Now, I know that now you're thinking I'm some sort of pseudo-intellectual teenager who thinks they know what they're talking about. A large part of my contextualizing is in part mixed with my pessimism and lack of confidence. I could pour my soul into something and believe it, in my eyes, to have been one of the greatest works that I have ever accomplished, and I would still assume that some one other than myself looking at it would simply scoff and tell me it's trash. 

See, or confidence. I am incredibly smug, and I know my own standards, but I honestly assume that others always assume the worst of me. Now this likely ties in to my childhood. When I was in elementary I was fairly confident, I always knew what to say, and I'd say it loud, and proud. I believed in myself, I was a bit of a smart-ass back then but that went to scar my character. I regressed back into my shell of self loathing. Now

Now, I am responsible for myself. The past is behind me, I'm not a child anymore. This is a time where I come to understand my psychology and I become who I want to be, not the same awkward child who couldn't handle some school yard bullying. I'm just glad I'm seventeen and I know who I want to be rather than finding out too late. Now, of course, tying back to my earlier note, looking at this must be awfully cringeworthy. Strangers on the internet divulging their introverted self-analysis in a pseudo-intellectual manner, or anything. 

I think I might know some things well. Who's it to which I'm comparing myself when I look to see how well I know the things that I do? I don't think I'm that great

&gt;""A wonderful fact to reflect upon

I actually memorized that quote word for word, it's an amazing ability. 

Of course the thing about quotes is that they're almost always as if you're invoking a higher intellect to support your very own statement, but if you know the quote then by proxy you should grasp the knowledge which the quote offers. 

Either way, as nice as they sound, are simply assumptions. Now, if you happen to become my pen-pal, the ideas that I send you will vary in their organizational level. 

This is probably the very base of my writing style. The uninterrupted train of thought. If you like doing the same, or not me, but my ideas, or not even my ideas, but something of the prospect of being my pen-pal, then go ahead and send a message.

I am a 26 year old guy that studies in Stockholm and in Enköping

A bit about me: 
I like being outside in nature and enjoy going on hikes. I have been hiking in the north of Sweden and once slept in a cloud at quite some altitude. Protip: Nothing dries in a cloud.

 I like cooking

I like watching movies and reading. I kind of like to watch and read almost anything but something about sci-fi and fantasy is more intriguing to me. I also am a big fan of documentaries and a Discovery-addict.

I like playing videogames and I am abit worried about my backlog of games I have to play through. I've been saving Arkham City for this summer since I really liked Arkham Asylum for instance. I am worried about Bioshock: Infinite going to take up a huge amount of my time as well. 

I am just looking for some nice people to talk to about whatever. Tell me how your day has been or maybe some cool recipes or share some photos or talk about whatever. I'd prefer to use email or something along those lines since my handwriting is horrible.

Wow

I think every person has an interesting story from which I can learn and experience the world in a different way than my own

I'm 20 years old and live in Hamburg, reading, outdoors, music, movies, games and of course in law, because that's what I study at uni. I think a lot about life, about other people and myself. But I am no introvert but like to meet new people and try to find out what differs them from the others. My love-life is almost always complicated

My greatest wish is simply to write the best book that has ever been written and read

Anyway, married, no children, and typically test as an INTP or INTJ. I've recently tested as an INFP, so I'm not sure how much stock I really put in these personality tests. Regardless, I think I'm more like a caramel-swirl ice cream, with these different personality types all mixed, one of them gets to be caramel; that's exciting.

I can't stress this enough: I'm *introverted*

I enjoy astronomy (specifically), with the acceptance that my speculations are probably wrong. I don't care for sports, but sports don't bother me.

When in the mood

I don't always listen to music. Sometimes silence is nice.

I've never been very wild

I feel like I missed most of my childhood

I was raised by two manipulative and emotionally abusive women

Despite the above, so it unfortunately doesn't happen.

I work way too much. I've heard that I should be glad to have a job

I've been permanently taken out of work due to severe chronic back pain with nerve damage so after I lost my fiancé, crapped on, Lexus/BMW/Jaguar/even a Ferrari

I have a wide variety of interests: I like computers, movies, learning new things, trying new experiences, traveling, going to Broadway shows, playing the piano, going on long drives, Breaking Bad, Fringe
30 Rock

I like all kinds of movies and try to see a new one once or twice a week. Dark Knight Rises is going to be awesome!!!!
I love going to the movies...even though certain ones remind me of my fiancé. Sigh...it's been hard but nothing that can't be overcome.

If I were to list everything I listen to here...it would be a very long list. 

Writing is a passion of mine as I do wish to be published one day. I made a promise to someone to get his life story published but his ended before the ending I had anticipated so it remains unwritten. He was one of the greatest people I used to know and I miss him greatly. He is lost forever and the world has lost what light he could have given us all. It's funny how unpredictable life is sometimes...I would have freely taken his place if the fates let me

I LOVE to read and I do so everyday. I read a lot of crime novels both true and fictional. I like science and medicine based fiction or factual books. I also am extremely interested in psychology and how certain events influence a person's thoughts/emotions. I'd like to go back to school to study computers in order to become a computer crime analyst for the FBI/CIA/NSA or whichever. I do not believe in law but I do believe in justice and doing the right thing even when the right thing means you will be standing alone as well as accepting responsibility for your actions. Laws are broken and manipulated by the very people who put them in action. 

I like meeting new people and learning about their lives. I just want to be a nice person to all even when people are not so nice to me. There isn't enough kindness spread in this world; it's become a dead quality to some since  nowadays it is viewed as weakness...or at least in my area of NJ...especially guys my age. It's been hard to cope with what I've had to this year but I'm getting through it as best I can.

I guess I'm looking for someone to connect with. Not in a romantic sense really, but fits in awkwardly. I know I'm probably describing everybody or nobody at all, but if that description means something to you, then, I guess, read on...

I like watching movies, but I like some indiefolk and some jazz. Some classical piano is good too. I mean, anything would be okay really, as long as it sounds good and gives me a good daydream. I usually like songs that have a bit of deeper meaning maybe, or possibly no meaning at all but it has to sound like it's got some deep shit going on, you know? I guess I like poetry too. Walt Whitman is a favorite.

I like doodling on my phone and just sending it on e-mail. Maybe write a few words that don't make sense and then sending that on e-mail. Some pseudo-haikus. Some random pictures of stuff here and there. I'd throw in a little bit of Instagram shit too. Hey, but I use it, okay? Also, I like getting to know people and people getting to know me too.

I used to be an avid roleplayer, and often a combination of the two. I've been on a hiatus from roleplaying for the last several months, but I wouldn't be against roleplaying if presented with something that interests me.

I don't care about the age of my penpals so long as minors aren't inappropriate [that really makes me uncomfortable] and whoever I'm chatting with doesn't use brightly colored hard to read fonts and loads of chtspk.

I'd prefer penpals to be literate

I'm a gamer. I game on a 360, but I don't play on that as much as the others.

I keep very strange hours

Talking to people and gaming with people really helps me keep my anxiety attacks under control

Sometimes I take a while to respond [sometimes several days if by email because I forget to check it] and those with more exciting lives may consider me a bit boring.

  My name is Braden and I'm a Junior who lives in North Carolina, I was in a USA-Denmark Exchange program last year and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Some of my greatest enjoyment in life comes from being active; physically, socially, I just love being in stimulating environments with stimulating people. I'm a Pole-Vaulter and a Cross-Country runner, in the past I dabbled in Wrestling but who can take two sweaty guys man handling each other seriously? If you're an outdoor hammocker then I would like to officially invite you to the cool club, you're one of us and we're going to be friends.

But I can be an indoorsy person too. I love Doctor Who, then I'll probably lose. Anything electronic is appealing to my ears as far as music goes. My favorite book series are  Ender's Game and Eragon, and I truly think the Universe is the most beautiful thing ever.
