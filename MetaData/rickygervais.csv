So far the script has worked out pretty well. Check out the parsed transcripts:

Sorry for delay in choosing the winnners. Part of the reason was being swamped by work but the main reason I took so long was because it's almost impossible. So many good quotes to pick from. A few commenters even mentieoned how impossible this task was!

In the end I went with two that surprised me or made me laugh thinking about them. Some classics were posted which I love but because I've heard them so many times they made me smile instead of actually laugh really hard so I'm going with a couple that might not be the ones others would instantly think of but absolutely classic pilkoid bollocks!

Winner #1 is TheRunawayState with ""When you're a kid

For some reason the mental image of Karl laughing in bed is hilarious but laughing because he ""couldn't believe my luck"" is just ridiculous. I'm still laughing thinking about it!

Winner #2 jonesey46 with the Christmas Blockbusters [[link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuKAgOhPUpo)]

Perhaps jonesey had an advantage because I'd somehow managed to miss this clip in the past so it was totally fresh but I think it's a totally deserving winner because... well because it just combines classic rockbusters bollocks with the christmas asburdity. All the swearing on air near the end cracks me up too.

Well done to both winners

Cheers to everybody for taking part. There were tons of amazing choices and it was really hard to pick just two but there we go. It's done! Monkey backing out of the bank

**EDIT 2: COMPETITION NOW OVER. NO MORE QUOTES PLEASE. I shall be announcing winners today or tomorrow on this page. Winners will also be notified via private message :)**

Hey Pilko fans!

For reasons that I don't need to go into I have two spare copies of [this product](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/KARL-PILKINGTON-SIGNED-PHOTO-PRINT-AUTOGRAPH-POSTER-GIFT-STEPHEN-MERCHANT-/320894554076?pt=UK_DVD_Film_TV_Autographs_CV&amp;hash=item4ab6ce4fdc#ht_1423wt_1396) which sells on eBay for £5.99. It's basically a glossy 12x8"" professionally printed photograph of the round headed twonk with a replica of his autograph on it. They actually look really cool

I will send them out at my own expense so I'm guessing more than 2 people will want to take me up on this offer. Therefore I thought it would be fun to create a little competition.

We all have our favourite Pilkington quotes but the winners of this competition are going to be the two people who post the quotes that make me laugh the most when I read them! If two people post the same quote then it'll be the person who posted first who will win. I will edit this post tomorrow announcing the winners and will send a private message to the two users for address details.

So who wants a head like a fucking orange in the post for free? AWAY YOU GO! MAKE ME LAUGH :)

Edit: Feel free to also include a link to the youtube video (if avilable) of him actually saying your chosen quote. Especially if you feel like most of the comedy is in the delivery.

&gt;Oh
&gt;
&gt;They will do an absolutely fantastic job and don't need my help
&gt;
&gt;  	(Drum roll) 
&gt;
&gt;V.O.
&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen.
&gt;Please welcome your hosts for this evening...
&gt;James Franco and Anne Hathaway
&gt;
&gt;(Music and applause)
&gt;(James and Anne walk out looking absolutely perfect)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Hello and welcome to The 83rd Academy Awards
&gt;Live from Los Angeles.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;That's foreign for City of Angels.
&gt;And this room is certainly filled will those angels.
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Thank you. I'm James Franco.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;...and I'm Anne Hathaway.
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;You probably know me from 127 Hours where I play a man trapped in an enclosed space who decides he would rather cut his own arm off than stay where he was. Now that sounds ""way out"" but wait till half way through this fucking ceremony and you'll start to identify with him. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;And I'm the new Catwoman. The first white woman to play that role since Michelle Pfeiffer. I want it to be an inspiration to all white people everywhere. Your dreams can come true in Hollywood too. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;It's a daunting task hosting The Oscars but we're not alone. Presenting awards tonight will be a string of Hollywood legends and some other actors who have a film out in March or April. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Usually they hire comedians to host The Oscars, you get us! 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;No comedians tonight. And do you know why? Because comics are ugly. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Especially that rude obnoxious one who played the Steve Carell part in the English remake of The Office. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;But you can all relax because Ricky Gervais is in London...
&gt;
&gt;(Nervous laughter) 
&gt;
&gt;He's doing some charity work.
&gt;Yeah
&gt;He's telling them what bald little losers they are... 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Yeah
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;Thank you.
&gt;No rudeness tonight.
&gt;It's going to be a night of the most privileged people in the world being told how brilliant they are and thanking God for loving them more than ugly poor foreigners.
&gt;
&gt;(Applause)
&gt;
&gt;That's not to say that we don't care. No
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Yeah and Yoko Ono said. ""What's wrong with that?""
&gt;
&gt;(Laughter)
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Oh Anne you are naughty. In a respectful
&gt;
&gt;(Nodding and smiling)
&gt;
&gt;That Ricky Gervais should do more for charity.
&gt;
&gt;(Murmurs of agreement)
&gt;
&gt;Ricky Gervais is now worth $80, adding,""Yes and my dentist hasn't seen a penny."" 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Yeah
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;It's a good question Anne. For the same reason he doesn't have botox or suck up to important producers - there's something wrong with him. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;There must be. Why isn't the stocky, right? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;That ugly dude needs to get a Hollywood makeover
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Quite. And even though most of the actresses here have eating disorders
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;You bet it is gorgeous. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;You are so handsome. 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Exactly.
&gt;You know Ricky Gervais used to be bulimic. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Really?
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Yes. He'd often gorge himself for hours with cheese and cakes.
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;And then vomit right? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;No he left that bit out...
&gt;
&gt;(Mild laughter) 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;That's because he couldn't get his fat fucking fingers in his stupid mouth.
&gt;
&gt;(Big laugh) 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Anyway let's get this show on the road.
&gt;There were some great kids' movies this year.
&gt;I took a five year old to see Toy Story 3 last week. 
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Did you enjoy it? 
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;No it was ruined for me because the little brat was screaming and crying all the way through the film saying
&gt;
&gt;(Laughter)
&gt;
&gt;AH
&gt;Oh James
&gt;
&gt;JF
&gt;Absolutely.
&gt;So let's get this show on the road.
&gt;Our first presenter is a Hollywood legend whose boots Ricky Gervais would not be fit to kiss...
&gt;The wonderful...
&gt;Mel Gibson...
&gt;
&gt;(Standing ovation)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And so on...

1. Ain't No Pleasing You	(Chas and Dave)

1. In The Ghetto	(Elvis Presley)

1. Babooshka	(Kate Bush)

1. Just Can't Get Enough	(Depeche Mode)

1. Dreaming of You	(The Coral)

1. Stranger on the Shore	(Acker Bilk)

1. Mack The Knife	(Bobby Darin)

1. Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa	(Gene Pitney)

1. Distractions	(Zero 7)

1. We Used To Be Friends	(The Dandy Warhols)

1. Informer	(Snow)

1. Pinball Wizard	(The Who)

1. The Killing Of Georgie	(Rod Stewart)

1. Wonderful Tonight	(Eric Clapton)

1. Living for the City	(Stevie Wonder)

1. The Purple People Eater	(Sheb Wooley)

I thought this could be a good chance to go a little bit deeper into the K-Man's world. I've just listened to it and I think it was totally worth it.

Can you give me some feedback on how to improve this subreddit please? 

In my experience, posts and comments. Then, after a certain stage, it kind of takes on a life of its own and doesn't need as much attention or promotion from the moderators.

So my question is: how can I best do that here? 

Does anyone want to be a mod here and help us grow this subreddit more?

We can do lots of nice css stuff, but again I don't think that would work without a strong sense of community based around it. Same with the circlejerk ""shenanigans"" - not much point without a big community behind it.

Maybe it's just a matter of time. I made a subreddit 5 months ago called [checkthisout](http://www.reddit.com/r/checkthisout/new/). 

It seems like a bit of a silly idea becuase it's a subreddit for ""content worth sharing"" but r/reddit.com does that already
