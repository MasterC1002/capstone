Sorry since this seems to be another question/advice thread while there are 2 already

I graduated undergrad about a year ago I am interested in a career dealing with conservation/ecology.  After graduating, nothing concerning ecology/env-sci except from some local volunteer work for a local nature preserve) and I am thinking about going back for a masters degree.  It seems like the only choice to really start a career for me at this point.  

One of the programs that caught my eye is environmental studies MA and MS programs.  So my questions are:

1.  For environmental studies

2.  I am interested in the MS, or something similar.  After this year of crappy job outlooks, I want to make sure that there is a job market out there for this field: is there?  I know it's good to follow your dreams and stuff but I also need a job that offers better health insurance and the ability to pay off my student loans.  I know a degree doesn't automatically equal a career, but I'd like to know if there is a healthy amount of opportunities out there before I commit to 2-3 years of more schooling.

3.  What are some other career paths with someone with an MS in environmental studies?  Most of the college websites I visit have very vague descriptions of what you can do after getting your degree (“you can work for the government, I have read about GIS, water testing, and environmental consulting, I'd like to know about these and some other paths as well.

4.  My college background actually has a mix of social and natural science (poli-sci and biology) which is why when I looked at the Environmental Studies programs, I would also be interested.

I was hired for a pretty basic position but I've far exceeded the duties and levels of effort for pretty much everything and I have definitely evolved my position into a much more advanced one.  The problem is I am still paid like a beginner/entry level employee.

I recently came into some financial trouble and I spoke to my supervisor because I needed to have an idea of where my salary would be adjusted to in order to stay with this company (that I really like).  He was totally okay with giving me at least the raise I wanted to expect (from 36, but because we work for a big company, there are hoops to jump through.

He said the best way for me to get what I want is to help him prepare data. I've collected average salaries for the work I actually do (Biologist II and GIS Analyst II on salary.com and Biologist with 4 years experience on payscale.com) but I want as much information as I can to secure a fair raise.

Can anyone in a similar position share their salaries and region so I can maybe have a little more data?

My job duties include:
-field work
     -wetland delineations
     -habitat assessments
     -species specific surveys (primarily bats)
     -invasive species surveys (bats
-reporting
     -concurrence requests to USFWS

i dont' want to go over the whole thing here

her basic conclusion was this:   planting one crop is un-acceptable. the way we're farming, which as you may know supplies 80 percent of the worlds supplies in almonds, a plant that requires pollination, and does not self pollinate) 

there are some simple steps landowners can employ to help the population of wild pollinators thrive

Due to the profile (and confidentiality agreements) of the companies involved I can’t give out too many details but I’ll try give as much detail as I can. It’s being built in the high arctic. Think Barrow AK if you’re looking on a map. The town has 3 phase power but I don’t know if we can feed back into the grid (I doubt we can generate enough power anyways). We intend on using heat reclaim and 25 watt T8 or LED lighting where applicable already. The insulation will be beefed up as well. It’s being built on a triodetic because the land is pretty much a swamp. Water is trucked in. This store will have a lot of refrigeration but that’s going to be top of the line and as efficient as possible already so I don’t think we can improve there unless there’s been some breakthrough in the field in the past month.


I'm scared of geothermal because if it breaks there’s no one remotely close to fix it and it’s often -40 up there so we need to make whatever we do nearly bulletproof. There are some minor rebates for wind and solar and this place has months of 24 hr sunlight that we might be able to take advantage of. If anyone knows of a calculator I could use to break that down I’d love to have a look.

SO I come to the minds of greenit for ideas. What can we do to reduce the carbon footprint and energy consumption of this store? Nothing is too big or too small. If you can show an example of something that has worked elsewhere I’d love to see it! If this makes me look like a champ to my boss

First post on reddit. I'm not sure if its taboo to ask for advice on your first post

I have recently quit my job where I worked in remote aboriginal communities in environmental health (I live in Australia). In this role I worked with traditional leaders, design water supply and management systems and a range of other projects. I conducted a human and environmental health risk assessment, sat on state wide steering committees and wrote state strategy etc. Having recently come back to the city I am not sure where to go with these skills. I don’t have a specialist area which seems to be a problem as big companies hire for a specialise area while my experience has been with identifying issues and figuring out how to fix them. I have been considering going back to university to do a masters course. 

My question is what areas have people specialised in and what was the reality of working in that area? 

I am looking at Environmental Impact Assessment and Management however from talking to people it looks like I’ll be doing 15min billable blocks (which doesn’t sound fun) and helping companies get away with doing as little as possible. Then in 10 years I’ll be getting lots of money.

I am a current community college student in the process of transferring to a large in-state university that is well-known for its environmental department. My primary interests lie in renewable energy (including design &amp; repair) and sustainable development (planning for food &amp; energy).

I think at this point a four-year engineering degree is out of the question

1) Pursue a ""hard"" B.S. in Enviro Science degree with a focus and/or minor in the more theoretical side of things.
2) Pursue a ""soft"" B.S. in Enviro Policy &amp; Planing or Enviro Econ. Management (both of these exist in B.S. form).
3) Pursue a two-year associates in electromech engineering technology with a focus in renewable energy.

Can anyone offer advice? My primary concern is that I will pursue one of these paths too hard and box myself in, unless we are talking about actually installing/repairing wind &amp; solar systems.

My advisor has proposed that I can choose to not graduate in May. That way, but I don't have any better ideas right now.


Any advice would be appreciated!


Edit: I should also mention that I did two full years of full-time internships in resource management at a national park between undergrad and grad school. I figured that would be decent experience that would help land a job (including one year of GIS experience),False,self,t5_2s90l,1364003317.0,,,t3_1au3xl

I'm quite interested in the planet and how it functions, but my general interest in education earlier in my life stopped me from following it

Thankfully

I'm quite interested in minerals

I'm quite inspired by my surroundings (I live in Wales, but hey, we can try and get some solar in here given the right technology). 

I just wanted to share my story and make myself known here.

I wanted to know some of your experiences and achievements and how you got where you are today

I'd appreciate anything you'd give me and it'd be good to get to know you.

Topic 1: Research and argue one way that has been proposed to help slow down climate change by cutting down on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Argue that it will (or will not help) slow down climate change significantly. The solution should be 3/4 of your essay.

Topic 2: Research and argue for one way to help solve a problem created by interaction of human beings and either animals (in the larger sense; you could write on a bird such as the spotted own or on fish) or plants. At least half your essay on the solution.
