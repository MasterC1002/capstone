Just wanted to thank you Notch. when you announced this game i was drifting from game to game looking for something to excite me. a new world to explore. a new game mechanic to amaze me. just generally bored. My friend pointed me toward this game and i got really excited and decided it would be worth the time spent to learn this dcpu-16 ASM. 

well a month or so later and i've picked up some python

I wake up excited every day to work on my project. i'm a happy guy. i smile. for YEARS i've been looking for something to stimulate my brain and make it work in new and interesting ways. the process of figuring out HOW to accomplish something (that bit of work between having an idea and actually writing code to make it happen) is MY ZONE!!!! my brain feels alive and engaged now.

For the past little while

All content is user-submitted and can be voted on (ala Reddit)

Check out the homepage/About section to get the full rundown

* Program previews
* Message boards: [see here](http://0x10c-cloud.com/Forums)
* Emulation and rendering is *streamed* and
* CodePad for quick prototyping
* ""Loadouts"" concept: XML-based hardware definition

This is honestly the first 'real' public community site I've put together and I'd call it a beta for now - who knows what I might have missed in terms of bugs or gotchas.  There's plenty missing and plenty left to do - more language conversions

The DevKit version powering it has been updated with the latest vector specs ([see here for a cool tag-based search](http://0x10c-cloud.com/Programs/AllPrograms/List/Hot/vector/-/5)) and disk drive specs - I just wanted to prioritise getting the *first version* of the site out of the door

Anyway, post some comments or content if you like - and enjoy the rest of your weekend.

I'm not too familiar with assembly, I've decided to write a simple overview of the system, so that even YOU* can try your hand at ""self-sufficiency"". For the purpose of this tutorial, I’ll be looking at [Mappum’s awesome emulator](http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16/) for any and all examples. To use it, put any assembly code you write in the left box, hit reset, hit compile, as things might move too quickly.

*YOU: Someone with little to no programming experience

**Anyway

Essentially, don’t tell the experienced coders I said this). Each “word” of RAM (of which there are 65,536) is four characters of hex. Hex is a number system that’s base-16 (unlike ours which is base-10) and always starts with “0x” (seen that anywhere else?). I’m not going to explain hex here, so you can Google that if you want (though, Google is really cool, and will translate hex to decimal if you enter “0x#### to decimal” and replace #s with the actual characters). Anyway, four characters of hex is 16 digits of binary,535 for each word. Cool

What’s in a word though? Well, because that’s just how it is. Still, even though it’s considered “code” it’s really just a number. But, you don’t have to worry about that, since assemblers take care of translating your code into the numbers for you. Instead, just understand that different places in the RAM might contain information that tells the CPU how to run.

Other places could just contain values. Maybe you need to store the number 42 so you always know what the ultimate answer is, b, c, x, y, z, i, because instead of having to remember to call up [0x1A32] for a value each time you need it, instead of just talking about the location (if we’re setting it to a value) or a number (if we want to set something else to 0x1A32). But

If you’ve played around with Mappum’s emulator, instead of just going up and up and up), but it’s important I explain the basic commands first.

Commands (or opcodes, because we get to just type the actual command and have everything handled for us. The first, and probably most important, example is this:

    SET a

This, and it can pretty much be anything. It can be a register (like “A” or “X”), a spot in memory (like [0x1000]), the PC, or a couple other things that I’m not going to get into for the purpose of presenting the absolute basics. “b” can really be any of these things as well. For instance, if you want to set register B to 1, you could type “SET B, if you wanted to set register A to the value of register B

    ADD a

This one works very similarly to SET, adds “b” to whatever “a” is. The same is for SUB (subtract), MUL (multiple), DIV (divide), and a few others. These will also modify O (overflow) if they, well, overflow

    IFE a

There are a couple IF statements built in, I’ll dissect a really simple FOR loop, which uses IFN (runs if “a” doesn’t equal “b”) which should help explain how this works in more detail. Before that, however, there’s one last important basic to show you.

    :a

This is how we label subroutines in this kind of assembly. Essentially, if I use one line of my program to type “:testsub”, and on the next line I type “SET PC, testsub” it will set PC to the location in RAM that I entered “:testsub” sending the execution of code back to wherever that happened to be. To really wrap together this, and everything else I explained here, I’ll outline a really simple loop:

    SET I
    :loop
        SUB I
        IFN I
            SET PC
        SET A

The first line of this sets register I to 0x000A, using “IFN” it checks I, and if I doesn’t equal 0, it sets PC to loop, causing the execution of code to return to that point. This subtracts another 1 from I, and checks again to see if I is 0. Once I is 0, it will stop setting PC back to loop,535).

I hope this overview has been helpful to you. I have to go now, if any actual professionals would like to make a correction, just leave me a message (or a comment) and I’ll check it when I get the chance. Thanks!

EDIT: Typed this in Google Docs so I wouldn't lose anything

**EDIT 2**: As per user request, PUSH, PEEK). I don't know how correct I am, because I'm not too familiar with the idea (I only know similar concepts), but you can find what I wrote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rvs5g/overview_of_the_dcpu16_for_newbies_to_end_the/c495cjw)

What bothers me is pretty simple and easily over looked.  0x10c starts off in the year 281,712,644 AD.  That's 281.4 ***trillion*** years into the future.  Now lets look at the Unix time stamp (which is a 64-bit integer, btw).  [At 15:30:08 UTC on 4 December 292,277,026,596 AD, there is still an excess of 281,048 years left over.

Now, *we would never wake up from it even if we used a 64-bit int*.

So that would mean we would have to use a 128-bit integer.  That would remedy the issue of never ending cryostasis and the clocks rolling over hundreds of times.  But there in lies a problem.  In order for that to work

To reiterate

But I've been developing it thoroughly for the past two days

The OS design is as follows:

* A monolithic kernel with an integrated bootloader and some standard functions mostly following the ABI (like memcpy

* A simple operating system with a basic prompt and a few built-in commands and an application loader (see the load_cleanf, because the applications include a jump table so they can use the functions exposed by the kernel and the OS.
* A collection of ""demo"" applications to showcase how programs should behave and interact with the OS and kernel.

The compile.sh generates a binary kernel.bin that can be loaded in most EMUs. I use DCPU16-Studio and all the functions work there.

Currently, when Notch releases IO specs (*please!*), the OS and programs will be theoretically loaded from whatever storage. With the current system architecture, this is very easy to implement.

** Build process **

You'll need noname22's assembler to assemble the whole thing. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/noname22/dtools/). Copy the ""dasm"" binary to the 0x42c folder and run ./compile.sh

** Features **

* Command prompt
* Backspace works!
* Loadable applications
* Very fast
* Easter egg(s)!

I'm writing a compiler that targets DCPU assembly. I will be releasing the source as soon as I finish some most of the basic features of the language. In the meantime, variables, and branching. You can try it out too. http://jemgine.omnisu.com/projects/DCPUC.zip I haven't written a spec on the language yet but here are the basics -

var a; //declare a variable.
a = 4; //assignment.
a = 5 * 2 + 3; //Math!
if (a == 13) //Branching
{
   a = 4; 
}


Edit - Alright. It has 'pointers' now
    var a;
    a = 0x8000;
    *a = 72;
will write an 'H' to memory location 0x8000

It also has functions. 
    
    function fib(n) 
    {
       if (n == 0) return 0;
       if (n == 1) return 1;
       return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }

    var a;
    a = fib(6);

Compile this and paste the output into your emulator of choice (I've been testing with http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16/ so I recommend that one) and let it run. It needs some optimization (it took 1065 cycles to run) but when it's done you should see '8' at memory address 0xFFFE!

I never played Minecraft. I watched about ten minutes of it and thought it was just not my kind of game. I did make a token attempt at writing a client for it

I have never been in the Cult of Notch. I watched about four minutes of his Ludum Dare live stream

I was a child of the 80s. I learned to program on a TI-99/4A. I've been a professional programmer for pushing 20 years now. I have done a little bit of embedded stuff (Parallax chips and Lego NXT

This project has the potential for over-the-top awesomeness. I spent time in Corewars, and I *love* this kind of game. It appeals to me *way* more than mining big blocks. I could actually see myself never actually playing 0x10c at all; just making software for it.

I have been blown away by some of the talent in this (and /r/dcpu16) reddit. There are some pretty good coders in here. I wrote my own assembler, given some of the other tools that are out already.

I have been dismayed by some of the fan-boy-ism as well. I guess that goes with the territory. Notch has such *amazing* community capital

I don't know what to expect in the future. I made some language tools

So the last week has been a mixed bag. I'll wait and see what the next few weeks bring before I render any kind of solid verdict.

If Notch does backtrack to fix some of the game's engine

 * Instead of placing shapes to design your ship, or control panels we can adjust the placement of buttons on.

 * Stop trying too hard to stick to accurate science. Frankly

 * Once you have a basic way of creating the ship and moving around (and of course, weapons, shields, etc. At the point where we have functioning engines, shields, and weapons, and then have I/O locations for the DCPU to control those things, and you can actually release it to be played.

* ***Serenity*** / ***Firefly***

* ***Alien***

The Nostomo traveled 37 lightyears (11.35 parsecs) in 10 months giving it a speed of *44.4 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Star Trek: The Next Generation***

The warp scale has been adjusted since the original series. Warp 1 is still the speed of light

---

* ***Star Wars***

Exact speeds aren't discussed much - probably because of the whole Kessler Run thing. But if a star ship can cross the galaxy in around 4 days

* ***Futurama***

The Planet Express Ship can travel at 97% the speed of the *new* speed of light. (Scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.) Farnsworth states it can travel between galaxies in hours.

 \- *9

 \- *2,000 times the speed of old light speed* (would be possible if it could travel to Andromeda II in 8 hours)

* ***0x10^c***

How fast should players be able to travel in 0x10c? What is a fun speed? The longest flight path in World of Warcraft takes about 30 minutes.[[1](http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-the-longest-flight-path-in-world-of-warcraft)] In Minecraft it takes about 40 minutes to travel 10

If we could travel a lightyear per minute (*526

In the future,000 ly away from the galaactic center of Milky Way. If we ca Milky Way is between 100k and 120k ly in diameter.

If we could travel at 1,000 times the speed of light*) we could travel between earth and the galactic core in half an hour, or if we travel in the opposite direction, we could reach the fringe in about 30 minutes as well.

This would be within the realm of Futurama-type speeds. 

Here's a possible explanation - Maybe our ships can't travel faster than light, our ships only have a speed of around 5 times the speed of light.

This would explain why we would need hypersleep on ships that can travel across the galaxy in hours

**Edit:** Increasing the speed of light by a *trillion* times would allow light-based messages and network packets to reach any ship or planet anywhere in the galaxy in less than 4 seconds. This would be very useful for communications. Meanwhile,False,self,t5_2tu92,True,,,t3_sx1l4

Well I was a little bored in the last few days
So here I present to you my humble attempts to write an interactive commandline or OS if you want to call it that for the DCPU.

**Commands**

* help - prints help
* inc v- increases value and prints the result
* add v1 v2 - adds both values together and prints result
* sub v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and prints result
* sadd var v1 v2 - adds v1 and v2 and stores result in var
* ssub var v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and stores result in var

* dev dn A B C - sends an HWI interrupt to the device dn with A B and C * set according to parameters
* devicelist - prints a list of all recognized devices with their device numbers
* rdd sec - attempts to read the sector sec from a Harold Media Drive (Seems to be broken in the emulator)
* memset adr val - sets the memory at address adr to the value val
* newline - prints a new line (only useful for scripts)
* exec addr - starts interpreting a string starting at addr as console commands
* jne rel val1 val2 - jumps rel characters in the string if val1 and val 2 are not equal (unsigned so to jump backwards use 65536-rel as value for rel)
* asm cadr dadr - compiles assembly from cadr into machine code and stores the result at dadr (dadr must be bigger or equal to hb000)
* jsr adr - jumps to adr with a jsr instruction

**Values**

You can prefix values with h to have them interpreted as hex or v to read the value from a variable.
So h0010 would be 16 in dec and v10 would be the value of the variable with index 10



**Assembly**

* Labels can only have numeric values and need to be prefixed with a capital L
* Parameters are separated by spaces not by a comma
* You can only use capital letters for opcodes and registers
* Literal Values work the same as with the console commands (So write hfedc instead of 0xfedc)

* A lot of browser additions made for Reddit, visually jarring and, well, generally bad. Yes, those who use RES (for example) can just turn off the style, ultimately leaving a out-of-place black logo (itself critique-able, but perhaps another time) against the familiar baby blues of Reddit.

* We know very little about 0x10c currently - Heck, five screenshots, maximum? Hence, very little of the game's artistic, visual direction and design is known. With such little direction, do we really need a huge-wizz-bang custom CSS at the moment?

I can understand the want for a custom theme - Done right it can look darn impressive, perhaps even hurts the community by making the subreddit less visually attractive.

**The Bastion**

Rather than building an agile ship or a mining ship, and as many generators as viable (assuming more than one is even allowed).

* Main communications DCPU to handle inbound messages from nearby ships and salvage messages from viruses.
* Main radar DCPU to detect nearby ships and pass them to the viral DCPUs.
* Power management DCPU to handle generator wattage to necessary systems.
* Viral DCPUs

**Cyber Warfare**

Lacking outright weaponry

* Straightforward known-vulnerability viruses
* Simple irritant viruses
* ""Matilda""-style viruses
* ""Smart"" viruses

All viruses have at the end of their operation a victory check, etc. to discern if the virus has successfully disabled the ship's onboard systems.

Once any virus manages to disable an attacking ship, suspended when new ships are detected (to ensure that the virus always has the latest version).

**Looting**

Whenever the station comms gets that salvage message

* If the ship is marked for scrap
* If the ship is marked for drone, attached to the radar system, and reduces the communications systems to an occasional transmission of the Bastion legend. No communication is accepted once this virus takes hold, drone ships are autistic and do not maintain life support, attacking any ship that they don't recognise as the station itself.

All other messages received by the station comms system are rendered as text to screens, in effect a space station focusing on network warfare will itself be an autistic system. ",,False,self,t5_2tu92,True,,

Imagine this, and a startup/shutdown/options menu. A default, simple but limited interface would also be optionally available to serve as something to get started with, from both a gameplay and development standpoint.

Now, we gain a wild array of options for how to play the game, and those are plenty creative on their own. Here are some possibilities:

1.   One ship would be owned by a player with no programming chops, until a week later when a zero-day vulnerability is discovered and he finds his shields dropping in combat *Wrath of Khan* style. (That'd only be possible with an in-game communication network, I know, but why shouldn't there be one?)
2.   Another ship could be a guy who built his own command-line interface for his ship in his spare time as a Ruby script - just to see if you could run a ship that way. 
3.   One person has a couple servers driving a fleet of several dozen ships powered by a custom bot that he wrote
4.   A group of friends is playing using an [Artemis](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/)-style web application that allows six people to control various systems on the ship, and a communications officer [insulting everyone's mothers](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/10/27/all-hands-on-desk-pcg-plays-the-best-star-trek-game-youve-never-heard-of-artemis-spaceship-bridge-simulator/).
5.   Some ships are run from mobile devices - the requests from those apps are forwarded to processes running in the cloud.
6.   Several dozen players are part of an alliance; this alliance has its own proprietary application for fleet coordination that connects with the standard ship interface the alliance has decided upon. This allows the alliance director to command his fleet in large engagements. Or

Notch has said he was interested in releasing 0x10c with the same billing structure as Minecraft by charging x for alpha, but Minecraft had an early release free version called Minecraft Classic.  It's fair to say that Minecraft Classic and the full release bare little resemblance to each other, but as a public free pre-alpha it did help build the very basic physics of player movement and placing blocks, as well as build excitement for the game through screenshots and videos of amazing creations.

My idea would be to release a free version that has nothing but the DCPU powered ship in a arbitrary environment with one planet and star to navigate around.  It doesn't need to be a random or infinite environment. It could be the same small universe repeating as u reach the edge.  It wouldn't even need multiplayer.  The point of it would be to provide an official DCPU emulator in an environment that makes sense.  A place to let people play with the ships controls and create cool software that would be functional in the real game.  The fact that so may DCPU emulators and software are starting to pop up is great, and displays.  Maybe make it posible to spawn multiple ships so we can experiment with inter-ship communications and networking.  Getting a fully featured emulator in the hands of as many people as possible is a good way to insure a large and functional software library when the paid release comes out.  By releasing a free version that is little more than an emulator so the programming gurus can play with it, you would ensure that the paid version is a more fun experience for the non-programmatically inclined.

Hello guys!

So

There are a few important points to consider:

 · We all come from all around the world. While the majority of people here is probably from the US

 · Reddit is a good place for news and discussion

 · We have a lot of people with very different interesting ideas

Here is my proposal:

 1. We decide a codename for our project, but we shouldn't abandon this place as it will always be a good place to get other people involved.

 2. Most of us would like to talk about the game in a more immediate fashion. There's already an IRC channel on freenode for that

 3. After we have a forum set up, and then continue organization there.

 4. Once we start building the team, make sure to get noticed! 

On safety precautions:

 · We should get some safety precautions in case something goes wrong

First of
This limitation would be in place to prevent players from simply switching their ship around according to the situation or to quickly gain advantage trough numbers without actual player cooperation.

--- **Building the ship** ---

So now you have your one
I don't think we can go the Minecraft route, Notch has already started that he has something else based around plain-colored polygons in mind.

So
First


*  Bulkheads: 
The majority of your ships structure would consist of them. They are three-dimensional convex rooms of arbitrary integer size. For example, but also increasing build freedom:

   
  *  'square':    only 90° angles allowed. Combined with the convex-restriction pretty much means 'cuboid'
  *  'octagonal': 45° angles allowed.
  *  'hexadecagonal': 22.5° angles allowed.
  

  The reason for this is, while on the other hand still allowing for a reasonable amount of freedom. 16 different angles are enough to build something that looks like a circle, and the visible polygon-i-nes would fit into Notchs targeted style. Also, It's a lot easier to get different parts of your ship to align if you only have to worry about a finite number of possible combinations.
  
  You can freely mix and match different complexities, can be oriented in the direction of any wall at build time.
So beginners could have a planar

*   Bulkhead connectors: 
   Basically everywhere where two different bulkhead walls run parallel and touch each other, you would need an octagonal connector. They conduct energy and the ships control systems, and can also be sealed/closed.

*   Ship engine(s):
   To set the ships main thrust vector. It's location would basically determine where the front side and backside of your ship is

*   Windows: 
The Ability to add windows to bulkheads. Should work like connectors

*   Docking port: 
 A standardized port to physically connect two ships together. Both sides can sever the connection anytime

*  Devices that interact with the outside
  Every device that explicit interacts with the ships outside would be placed on a wall (or floor/ceiling)


Imagine the bulkhead-building like the wall-placing from The Sims

The Next step would be to fill your modules with every object that's necessary for your ship.

*   the Computers/DCPUs
*   the Reactor
*   Standalone Devices/Sensors
*   stairs, decorations etc

Everything that needs energy is tied to the bulkhead it's placed in. Turn off the bulkheads energy

Again

Finally, basically give your ship a skin. That could be cheap, decorative plastic panels, or actual armor plating that would increase your ships defenses. The Game would take care to prevent you from blocking windows/engines with hull plates, and things like sensors or antennas could be automatically or manually be moved to be on the hull instead of being covered by it.

Imagine the Spore vehicle/spaceship editor

--- **Building superstructures** ---

Another reason for the fixed-angle-restriction is that you can easily build ships that can reliably connect to other ships at multiple points at once, form a big space station, or a big spaceship. Every player would remain in full control over his individual ship, especially in regard to things like its engines/tractor beams/computer etc. Every player could control on a per docking-port basis whether to share energy, their computers, or other devices. Two Examples:

*   3 Players combine their ships into one. 
 
  * One of them assumes the role of the navigator/captain
  * The second one would be in control of weapons
  * The third one would be in charge of most computers, monitor space etc.


*  Around 20 players form a space station.
 * They could provide a place for other players to park their ships
  * Or they could serve as a bank/warehouse for other players.
  * All station systems would have to be centrally connected. Special care would have to be taken to match up every ships thrust vectors for navigation.
  * The high amount of DCPUS would allow for some fancy calculations.
  * Likewise
  * The players would have to build with redundancy in mind
  * Rouge ships
  * The station would have enormous offensive/Defensive capabilities

Edit: Let me build a scenario or two

Simply imagine a carrier, there could be two players functioning as the roles of engineers. These players can tweak, overclock, repair and even upgrade parts of the ships very efficiently and fast compared to other players. These tweaks could go for everything from the engine(s) to the weapons. All these tweaks and upgrades could be done to the larger carrier ship too. Even though all the ships would be the same stock fighter, they have all been customized by their pilots, so they can easily identify eachother.

Sci-fi would have you believe that in order to take over another space ship all you need to do is obtain their (pretty simple) command codes and boom their ship is in your control. I don't think it will quite be as simple as running the 'hack' command from afar and sending an enemy's ship flying into a sun. This is why I think that.

Modern day hacking typically involves finding some sort of vulnerability in a computer system. This is pretty easy as the base operating systems are pretty much all standard. Instead of a bank writing their own, so they can test vulnerabilities on their own machines, then use what they find against a target. Heck, the manufactures of these even tell people what the vulnerabilities are (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760) to try to get them to install patches to fix them!

Viruses are similar, typically they are installed by an action performed by the user of a target system. Given modern day general purpose computers, running all sorts software from different vendors, it is pretty common to have various security holes in your computer. Most people who get viruses (e.g. your parents :rolleyes:) aren't really that tech savy and don't know that you shouldn't click links offering you £1,000,000, open files from unknown sources, etc.

The DCPU will be different though. It won't be running a standardised operating system (you'll probably end up writing it yourself), hacking won't be anywhere as easy like it is with computer systems today. Oh and I didn't even talk about the networking (or lack thereof) side of things...

So, but I don't really think they are that feasible:

Maybe in terface where we could write a code, or memory position, to a certain statem depending on the state of a toggle, or we could use a code to tell the controller to light up a lamp on the virtual dash under certain conditions (e.g. the engines stop responding to commands, or if certain doors open). Some degree of customisation would  be nice, so everyone could have a different dash, and one of the perils of hacking someones ship would be working out how to fly the damn thing.

The last idea, that would functions a a touchscreen version of your dash, or a portion of your dash, so you could set up your iphone or ipad next to your keyboard, and be able to set thrusters to 95% drive (or whatever) with a touch of a finger...

Tenc is a Java (so cross-platform) compiler that compiles a kinda-c-looking language to assembly that can be assembled and run in an emulator.

For example

    int main(){
    	int i = 1;
    	return a(1) + i;
    }
    
    int a(int a) {
    	return a * 4;
    }

compiles to 

    SET PUSH
    SET PUSH
    SET PC
    :exit SET PC
    :func_main
    SET Z
    SET Y
    SET X
    SET I
    SET [I]
    SET PUSH
    SET I
    SET Z
    SET Y
    SET Z

as you can see, both of which are coming soon (loops can already be kind of done with recursion, just watch out for overflowing the tiny stack). It's also open-source, so you can hack on it!

;Alright
;Please note that I don't consider this finished- I still need to write up the last part

DCPU-16 Specification Copyright 2012 Mojang Version 1.1 (Check 0x10c.com for updated versions)

""* 16 bit unsigned words"" A word (two bytes) is the smallest unit of memory that can be accessed in this system and collectively have an assigned memory address. Unsigned means that the bit usually reserved for parity (negative or positive) is used instead to double the total amount of positive integers it can potentially hold. 

""* 0x10000 words of ram"" This is the amount of memory your programs can occupy and use for storage. The floppy drives will be slow, so this will be relatively concrete cap on your programs and their data.

""* 8 registers (A, X, Y, Z, I, J)"" A register is a special word, used by the opcodes for input and output. They reside at a very specific and never changing place in RAM. EDIT: Most of what I thought before is wrong- it appears that there is no preference between any of the registers

""* program counter (PC)"" All of the computer's memory is made up of 16 bit words, and as execution of your program advances, the address of the current instruction will have to be remembered by the computer in order to be able to consistently perform the next line of your program, and advance it after. (This is easier understood than explained, and I won't insult your inteligence.) PC is essential for complex or branching programs, because it can be written directly to and this will make your program 'jump' in its execution to a spot other than it otherwise would have, meaning that you can perform some semblance of boolean logic using the four variants of if which are at the end of the opcode list.

""* stack pointer (SP)"" The concept of a stack was way foreign to me when I first learned. This was because it has a very specific structure, with the stipulation that only the last one added can be accessed. Many people relate this to those plate stacks you might see at buffets (dunno if they have these outside the US) that sink down under the weight of all the plates until only the top one shows, and which, upon removal of the top plate, rise to bare the next plate which was, of course, placed on directly before the first one. It's the same with stacks, the register specified (I'm not clear if this is required to be A or not) will be copied to the word after the last word on the stack

""* overflow (O)"" This is what is called a flag- it is set to 0x0001 within the operation of the called function if and when the result of a calculation passes than 65536. Keep in mind that a subtraction underflow will also trigger this, (depending on whether you are adding or subtracting) sequentially from right to left, and when it gets to the end of the number and has more to 'roll', it triggers the overflow flag(regardless of whether or not it was actually an underflow). It will be possible to write routines for the support of larger numbers, though these are unlikely to be neccesary.

""In this document, but [SP] means the value of the RAM at the location the stack pointer is pointing at."" What Notch is on about is that there is a big difference between a words address in memory, and the value that that word is storing. If the code says SP, for example, then the address that the stack is currently 'stacked to', for lack of a better word, is going to be referenced. However, then the value of the word whose address is stored by SP is referenced.

""Whenever the CPU needs to read a word, the CPU will modify a value before reading it, in this case the shorthand is [++PC]."" This just means that the address of the current instruction is increased every time an instruction is completed, simple stuff really. Sorry to be using line of code and instruction as interchangeble terms- guess that might be confusing to beginners.

""Instructions are 1-3 words long and are fully defined by the first word. In a basic instruction, called a and b. a is always handled by the processor before b, and is the lower six bits. In bits (with the least significant being last), a basic instruction has the format: bbbbbbaaaaaaoooo"" Note that what I said about PC being incremented by one is a little flexible, as some (few) instructions are longer than others. That's what this says.

If interpersonal combat works this way there are a couple scenarios that I would love to play through.

Like being a space ninja and sneak onto a giant ship using a cloaked pod and sneak the life and valuables out of everyone on board using a space shank leaving the entire structure a ghost ship drifting through space.

Or be a pirate and do forceful invasions of victim ships and just slaughter everyone on board with lasers and space swords then take their loot.

Or Land on a desert planet and set up a large base or fort like structure and have pew pew laser gun wars over the unobtanium mines (although someone might just shove a battle cruiser up the entire base's ass and render pew pew wars useless in comparison).

So anyways what are your speculations on out of ship person vs person combat?

EDIT: OH AND KILLER ROBOTS!!! DON'T FORGET DCPU POWERED KILLER FUCKING ROBOTS!!! And speaking of robots what about mechas? I think some kind of walker might level the playing field if players start attacking each other with ships near the ground.

* I learned DCPU assembly.  This part isn't very hard, it just requires a little bit of discipline and organization skills.
* I wrote some basic routines [putc getc readline print newline cls itoa etc] BY MY SELF (aka without just copying someone else's implementation).  If you don't understand how simple functions like that work and are chained together to form larger programs
* I read about basic programming structures like null-terminated vs. fixed-length strings and arrays/lists.
* I wrapped those basic routines up into a rudimentary shell.

Try it.  That alone gives you the basics to make an 'OS' for the DCPU.  Try creating a file system and a directory structure to use with the MFD floppy device.  Or create an object format for the SPED display and a routine to display it

Also, if I'm building a small vessel like X-Wing, one reactor and maybe 1 DCPU-16 should be fine. If I'm building Enterprise, capable of holding more than 400 crew members, maybe 3 DCPU-16 wouldn't be enough.

What are everyones thoughts on having an opcode reserved especially for debuggers to recognize as break points in a program.

When executing without a debugger, and pause execution.

The reason it's important that an opcode for this is reserved in the official DCPU spec is to ensure a couple of things:

* All Debuggers have a standard to follow
* Ensuring that the opcode isn't later used in the DCPU spec.

A real world counter-part to this opcode would be INT 3. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)#INT_3)

INT 3 has it's own opcode, such that debug information can also be passed from the running program to the debugger through the single argument that special opcodes receive.

A group of 5 to 20 players could move their power supplies to a mobile gun platform with fighter bays and a large stock of rechargeable batteries. 

One captain could maintain the carrier while the fighters go off and run hit-and-run fire until the burn out a battery, and get back into battle. 

This could mean for a pretty good excuse to have boarding battles. On modern naval battles

So basically you never die and neither does your ship. I really dislike this. The respawning of the player is fine

Edit: Also I'm talking about your physical ship, similar to how EVE retains your skill points and such, but your ship is ultimately destroyed.

What my approach would be since this is a hard scifi approach to the game:

You have a ship that you own, lets say skill points for hypothetical sake. These are 'bound' to your character, you don't lose them when your ship is destroyed. Ships should be destroyed, it makes sense with the hard scifi theme and hell, even the looting feature that is planned. You can salvage and loot ships and so on. However, when you die, your character respawns with all your software and whatever else. You'd perhaps have a pod somewhere where you respawn in with your stored consciousness and stored backup of your software, but your physical ship is destroyed. This fits in with the hard scifi approach to the game

What's your opinion? Perhaps this is something that can be reconsidered

I'm thinking about how we want to shape the overall in game culture. I like EVE Online in that players can be mean nasty pirates

I think part of this is that the important civilized side of the game is hard coded and not created by the players. They have no vested interested in protecting their gate system or the large market stations because they are hardcoded to never be destroyed. Anything players create only benefit the player or their corp/alliance.  There is no global utility. There are some exceptions (ISS and CVA back in the day)

so we know we got here through statis sleep. but are we sitting aboard a fully kitted ship ready to arrive at whatever destination was planned at departure? this implies the computers were installed and programmed to do something BEFORE you left earth which means software already on your computer. or have we been intercepted and woken before the timer ran out? that could leave us waking up with nothing and in the custody of some npc. maybe we wake up during the destruction of our ship as it pulled into some blackhole or plunges into a star and we find ourselves in sort of a tutorial where we make a dash for the escape pod.. leaving us with nothing..

That doesn't, I propose we invent a new type of packet. Basically, this packet is going to have a header containing four things. The first will be a couple bits just to allow other ships to recognize it is a packet, the second and third will be standard destination and source address, and the last will be a random value between 0 and 255 (half of a word, so we can have some kind of identifier in the next 8 bits that let the machine know the data is starting). In the footer, we *might* add a simple checksum because everything is wireless

As far as routing goes, you would need a daemon on one of your CPUs that functions as a router (though this could probably be integrated into another program; that's why it's so simple). Any messages received with the starting bits identifying it as a packet will be re-transmitted in all directions, very little thinking involved. If the ship is the receiving end, the daemon won't forward the packet. Afterwards, it'll check for data integrity (if we have some way to check that in the footer), de-capsulate the packet to remove the identifier (saying it's a packet) and the footer, and pass it to any CPUs/programs on board the ship that have signaled they are looking for packets.

The more technologically advanced of you will probably notice the huge flaw in this idea. Taking into consideration everything I explained, and store the information about each packet into a temporary table along with a timer. These values will decay over a certain amount of time, but while they are in the table, and packet with identical characteristics (including random value) will be thrown out to enable a kind of split horizon system. 

Security, so that should be able to be encrypted easily. At the same time, while standards for addressing could probably be very useful (and maybe it'd be nice to implement a kind of MAC address to use as an IP for completely unique identifiers if Notch adds that functionality to the ships) at the moment addressing is very relaxed to allow for manipulation based on what a particular program needs. Maybe it's a chat service, and rather than sending a message to each individual participant, the chat room designates a random broadcast address that's sent out to chatters and kept track of by the clients to ensure only one transmission has to be sent out for each message.

1334870554.0,sih6t,Scientific Explanations,Mavvik,29,9,30,"I got bored so I figured I would make a list of possible scientific explanations for the various pieces of technology in 0x10^c:

Let's start with propellantless

**Alcubierre drive (Warp Drive)** Warp drive is a theoretical concept that would be physically possible. It working contracting space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it. The cool thing about this is the rules of special relativity do not apply since the ship would be stationary within a ""warp bubble"" between the warped space-time. Scientists have theorized that it could be accomplished by expanding the 11th dimension in front of the ship and shrinking it behind the ship creating dark energy. http://news.discovery.com/space/warp-drive-spaceship-engine.html This is a fairly decent explanation of how warp drive would work.

**Field Drives** Field drives are another cool type of ""engine"". These are not dissimilar to the warp drive except instead of contracting and expanding space-time it folds space time to create a sort o artificial gravity field. This can be done in a few ways

Now let's look at energy sources

**Zero-Point Energy** Zero-point energy is a controversial subject that borders on pseudo science but recently there have been promising breakthroughs. Zero-point energy is the idea of harnessing the background energy fluctuation that exists everywhere. if you were to remove everything from the universe there would still be resonant energy known as ""quantum vacuum energy"" that would still exist. The amount of energy that exists in this ""quantum vacuum"" is huge (10^36 to 10^70 J/m^3) and if we can tap into even a fraction of it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy
http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050170447_2005172301.pdf (pg 65)

This sort of energy source could be used to explain just about any piece of technology that require much more energy than achievable today.

**TL;DR** Much of the technology that would need scientific explanation can be easily explained through warp drive

If I'm counting correctly, IMHO. You can't do all that much with a screen that small.

For comparison

The Commodore 64 / 128 (which obviously inspired the computer screens in 0x10c) allowed 40 x 25 characters on the screen

I was hoping to be able to make some sort of communication software similar to 1980's style BBSes. If you don't know what a BBS was,r:3,s:0,i:71&amp;tx=22&amp;ty=44).

1333708795.0,rw420,My plans and why I am excited for 0x10c,FracOMac,25,8,24,"Just to give a background

Being a huge fan of both space MMOs and low level programming I'm extremely excited at the thought of 0x10^c and the possibility of programming a fleet of ships with a ""swarm"" behavior.  We of course do not know many of the smaller details of the game as it is likely that Notch has not even thought that far ahead


Assumptions (Notch has not explicitly stated any of this but based on what he seems to be going for I'm thinking):

* The DCPU will be able to control most/all ship systems
* There will be some form of networking possible between DCPUs on the same ship
* DCPUs will be able to access some sort of comm system
* Comm systems will be inherently insecure
* There will be DCPU accessible telemetry data (probably just ships/other large objects but if we're lucky we'll be able to get data on projectiles)
* Power will be a very limiting factor on ships

If all these hold true then I believe a swarm strategy is the best way to go.

**Fleet Design**

Drone - Ideally I will come up with a nice balanced ship hardware design that I can mass produce that will be capable of both combat and economic roles to support fleet expansion. If such a ship build is not practical then they will be solely combat ready with a separate subfleet for economic purposes.  They will be capable of basic automation that can be overridden by the command ship which will designate targets.

Command Ship - This is where I will be

**Communications**
Secure comms are vital for this to work

**Upgrades**
My fleet will be constantly evolving

**Ship Damage**
This

**Drone Design**

* As I said before drones will be as cheap as possible
* Assuming 3 DCPUs per ship I will have the main computer
* 3d movement and targeting calculations require a lot of heavy math
* The 3rd DCPU will be the machine responsible for things outside the ship, and raising defenses if an immanent threat is detected.  Additionally, the other 2 DCPUs will be setup to trigger a self destruct if access to the comms DCPU is lost for more than a small preset time.  This is because access to my source would be a major security risk as a big part of my security will be through the uniqueness of it and the source being unavailable.

**Command Ship Design**

* This is where I will reside in my fleet
* The following dcpu/terminals are listed in the order of importance
* Main computer
* Comms/telemetry
* Math DCPU
* My workstation
* ""Cyber Warfare"" station
*Database

* A chat network. I'm pretty sure Notch won't be putting any ship-to-ship chat in the game, there needs to be ONE kind of chat software, so everyone who's read up on the game can communicate right when they install the OS on their first ship's computer. An evolution of this would be an email client and server.

* An economy. Sure, and all the materials could have a value in the currency, so conversion can happen. I suggest Trillek for the name of the currency if thats not how it turns out you pronounce 0x10c.

Just wanted to add that I hadn't been clear enough that:

1. Yes

2. Yes, very gradual, so not a core thing you would use all the time

---

Based on Eld's mockup here: http://i.imgur.com/akByX.jpg I wanted to make the following observation. This is not necessarily crticism (it's too early)

**Acceleration:**

The ship out the window has its engines lit

Any spaceship designed for intersteller travel where by the passengers would be necessitated to go into suspended animation would not be any kind of 'agile' space fighter. Technology wise, but continuously, such that the ship can eventually reach the incredible speeds needed to cover the distance. Burning a ton of a fuel for a short time simply isn't going to get you fast enough.

Therefore, but instead use orbital mechanics to slow down and enter the orbit of the destination, then use the local star as a slingshot to speed up again on the exit. Efficient long-haul flight would therefore not provide the flexibility needed to ""dog fight"" in space. These ships are big, designed for maximum efficiency of travel and have a turning circle measured in AUs.

Therefore

1. Long range lasers and a small stash of missles for sea-style battles where the large ships position each other parallel to the other and hope for the best outcome

2. Docked to the ship would be one or more small combat fighter ships that the player could jump into and use to dogfight in space (this could be a DCPU of its own). These ships would be tiny (like a WWII fighter plane), but loaded with the best weapons. (this is also how you would land on a planet, or board other ships)

(The spaceship outside the window in Eld's mockup image could of course be construed to be just such a fighter ship

So, but at the same time, can turn on a dime in a combat situation; it lacks the risk and excitement of knowing that your ship is large, travelling incredibly quick and cannot just loop-de-loop and escape at the drop of a hat. Every encounter with an enemy is potential death and there will almost never, ever be a time where you come away unscathed by any combat situation.

It is a game of survival and in any combat, Ace Rimmer style.

 * PK crypto system for communicating over Notch's proposed Hyperverse implimentation of UDP to comm with BBSs.

 * *fast* symmetrical system would be fun.

 * A fast steam cipher

I was thinking DES originally but now that I think about it


What I know of the DCPU-16 is it has 1 Megabit of ram and will be somewhere around 100-200Khz. So if we do this we have to make it *tight*. 

The symmetrical cipher I propose is Blowfish. It is the fastest cipher I know of that is still recommended for use without hardware acceleration. The number of rounds I propose for Blowfish is 5-7 rounds and a 64bit key. A 32bit key is way to easy to be bruteforced by a home computer. I do not know what block mode to use


The stream cipher could be the same as above but using CFB(Cipher Feedback)


I think doing PK crypto on this will be balls to the walls. We definitely can't use RSA. I would like to keep the keys under 100 bits yet a 100bit RSA key is factorable in hours. In addition whatever PK crypto we choose will also have to do double duty to sign messages. 


In addition to the normal crypto concerns we would have to do significant memory management. I haven't found anything on if there will be external storage emulated or if everything has to fit in 1MB, or cause power management to degrade, etc. 


Does anyone want to chime in on their thoughts about the crypto choices I have made? There are still many choices to make but I think it would be very fun to do this! What about additional information on the emulated computer?

Will engines be powered by the generator (one per account) or by ""fuel""?

I ask because

-Will we actually be able to land
-Are the engines powered by the generator?
-How big can your ship be before it's too big to land? (How much mass can 1 generator lift?)
-What happens if you get ""stuck"" on a planet?

Or

Anybody have any clue?

1361815913.0,197c6k,How in depth is the design of systems ?,pablo1990,24,6,4,"Hi guys

I have been interested in this game ever since i heard about if but have been a bit too busy to follow it so forgive me if i'm asking a question that i should already know.

I was interested in how the ships system we are in will link up and how effective they will be.

To my understanding we are using 16 bit computers to program the systems of our ship. But will this just mean creating functions for connecting systems together

Let me try and give an example of what I mean.

Case 1 : (The idea that I think we have currently 

We have many systems such as weapons

In the long run the basic idea is to write effective code that has no bugs in and is memory efficient. ( again if that's wrong i would love a more detailed idea )


Case 2: ( The idea which I would think is cool and would make ships so variable In my belief . I also feel it would make it less of a coding exercise and more of a free for all of creativity in design.)

Ships systems can have a default settings so they work effectively to a sense and you can just leave it as a programming challenge to connect them. ( That would be there mainly for the people that don't want to mess around with their ships at the beginning)

But lets say its not entirely efficient 
So you can change the dynamics of the systems by say improving the sensors or maybe a more efficient actuator ( Obviously all these systems have different complexities and difficulties to get )

But not only that you can create algorithms to control the output of your systems . Maybe create feedback loops for your programs or PID controllers to make your systems react quicker .

I think what I'm basically asking is will systems on this ship just work like perfect systems which you will have no control over. Or will they be more ""life like "" and have certain dynamics that can be fiddled with using basic design methods.

As the latter i think would be cool !

Anyway tell me what you think or if you don't understand what I'm trying to ask tell me and ill try and explain it in a more effective way.

I just don't think you can have Space flight without control theory.",self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/197c6k/how_in_depth_is_the_design_of_systems/

It also ties into the ""hard sci-fi level 4"" rating of just a single concept being fictional while allowing the rest of the universe to operate on normal principals and allows for some interesting dynamics as well.

The basic idea is to have a device which can emit a field which alters the cost of inertia relative to a maximum speed.  The basic operation allows ships to have a standard propulsion drive

If you allow the field size to vary up to some game tested maximum (say 1/100000th of an AU or approx 150 mile radius) and make it so slow fields overwrite fast fields then you have the following dynamics:

- Ships not proximate to other ships can go faster than light up to their rated field maximum based on their propulsion systems.

- Ships proximate to other ships can be slowed to the proximate ship's rated field minimum based on the propulsion systems.

- Planets/stations can employ ""blockade"" drones surrounding them to prevent FTL missile barrages/dropped rocks.

- Space combat can occur at speeds where human reflexes are relevant if one of the ships dueling wishes to switch to ""combat speed"".

- Proximity sensors can auto-trigger low inertia mode to prevent collisions at high speed.  The bigger the object (like a star) the farther away you can detect and trigger low inertia mode.

Some other thoughts:

- Perhaps have the effects of a gravity well negate the effects of the fields within a certain proximity?

- Have the field power costs tie into a sliding scale based on how slow/fast you go.  If you want to slow down you and your opponent really slow, but not so slow that it's like watching a turtle fight.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,

The world is initially populated with resources, thus creating a cycle of resource consumption.

Someone finds metal that metal is used on a ship, that lost metal is then put back into the world on a distant planet given other players a chance to collect it and gain from its sale or use. In a more advanced version of this model, some resources can actually degrade into simpler components instead. Wood turns to coal, which turns into energy, which after being used can be reintroduced into the world as light to help trees grow, thus creating more wood, and closing the cycle.

This eliminates inflation from the game, very similar to real life, that no other game can currently provide.

I had huge troubles fitting a small subset of the characters I wanted into it. So I had an idea. Different display modes. Basically, but this actually plays well with my proposal. The more characters you allow

When the DCPU receives an HWI, and switches modes accordingly. Switching modes takes one cycle (except for High-Character Mode) While switching modes, the screen stays on the previous image. 

If it is 0x0000, coloured mode (which I call Blink Mode or Mode 0).

If it is 0x0001, then it remains blinking in Colour Mode. This allows for blinking text to be displayed by quickly switching to blink mode, cetting a cell, and then switching back to Colour Mode and printing the desired character.

If it is 0x0002, or Mode 2. It takes 10,000 cycles to switch. In HCM, 12 bits of the word are used to encode the character, and 4 bits for foreground colour. This allows for a maximum of 2^12 (4096) characters. This allows characters to be swapped into the font as needed. In HCM, neither blinking nor background colour can be controlled. If one wanted to do this, they would have to switch to Blink Mode, switch back to HCM,000 cycle switch time makes it nearly impossible to do graphics this way. This is intentional. Notch said that he wanted to present a challenge with the monitor, as it takes 1/10 of a second. Not a noticeable delay for the user

If it is 0x0003 or above, and then then it will return to Blink Mode.

* The boot device does not need to be the first valid boot device in the HWQ listings. I would rather be shown a screen on the DCPU to choose which device to boot (if there are multiple choices)
* It makes hardware bootable or non-bootable

Q: What is the purpose of I and J?

A: I figure that rarely, you're executing an operating system from a remote server? Well, sure, I have the communication device I used, and the boot code for the operating system, but where does the communication device need to call to get more data? What is the data transfer standard for the remote server? Do I need to log in as a user? I and J can hold data, or point to a data structure with that information.

Suppose that I came up with a really awesome program.  I really want to keep the source code myself

...except I'd developed it in singleplayer.

What I'd like to see is a sort of ""quantum floppy"" - one whose contents are saved on an official Mojang server or something

Storing these ""quantum floppies"" wouldn't be too costly for Mojang - [1 GiB of HDD space could hold up to 728 users' 1440 KiB QF's](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+GiB+%2F+1440+KiB)

And if you're asking for data out of the QF sector-by-sector, that's roughly [1.71 milliseconds per sector](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1024+bytes+%2F+4.8mbps)... which, according to the [M35FD specs](http://dcpu.com/floppy-drive/), quoting a read/write speed of 30.7 kilowords per second, or 61.4 kilobytes per second, or [0.4912 megabits per second](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=61.4+kilobytes+per+second+in+Mbps), there's plenty of time for this data to come through a halfway-decent Internet connection of 2013.

Calculations (and Wolfram|Alpha) aside, information could be transferred between saves / servers / dimensions / whatever we're gonna call it, but I can definitely see that there could be a number of servers popping up, with the sole purpose of trading code between players.  There could be a whole economy (and a potentially huge pirating community) based around code trade.  Alternatively, it could be used to allow players to go on various servers with their favorite programs in tow.

6. Every option based on a drop down menu of either saintly

These are things in every MMORPG

You start out on a random planet, at which point you can see that every planet has x forest, x gas, x mineral, and you can mine them from 3-4 key areas shown by  little dots on the planet to show you where exactly to go. You the fly around from planet to planet, leveling skills pre-defined by that one class you chose at the beginning, buying from the ""Intergalactic Shop"" to be able to kill even better, who might as well be your ship for all you know, all the while actions and what you do in the game are based off of three options to every action

That would be a cookie cutter MMORPG. Raking in millions, and then coming out with a new and improved sequel to the game making an improvement on graphics as a selling point. This, again, is NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECT TO SEE. I would lose all faith in Mojang/humanity. What Mojang and Notch need to do is reinvent the genre. The game isn't even Alpha and it has over 10,000 followers, and I believe notch can do a lot more at this point creatively than many other companies out there only for the money with their cookie cutter design. It doesn’t need better graphics, a unique story, I believe, or dialogue that binds you to either good or evil. This is advertised all over, and I believe that someone can

Starting out, but not bind you to a path. The first planet could either be a home for weeks, or instantly a launch pad into space exploration from the random factors of if your injured, nearness of a ship, if you are in space and need to pilot into an orbit, how close a ship is to you, enemies, you start your adventure. No features left out

I am sorry for the EXTREMELY long post, even it starting with the words MMORPG making many people possibly having a bit too much premise, or to little about what the game will actually be like because of this one acronym, and what it will mean for how good or bad the game, in the end turns out to be. I am as excited as the next guy to see this game develop all the way through, and am ready for a as many changes and variation as there needs to be. It would be interesting to see what opinions anyone has, and want to know if what the things that I am thinking about are actual things should be tossed around as ideas for a game at such an early stage of development.

BEQ is stricly more useful than IFE since it lets you jump to an arbitrary instruction instead of only two ahead. You could accomplish the same thing as a single BEQ instruction, though, since instructions in DCPU-16 aren't word-aligned, as they are in MIPS.)

To take this a step nerdier: There's a pretty high hardware cost in implementing IF_ in a processor architecture relative to B__ due to having to fetch and decode the next instruction (to know how much to increment the PC by) in the middle of the writeback.

Lots and lots of gadgets: I would like to find and place small in-ship sensors as well. Motion detectors, light bulbs (dcpu16 controlled), robots (with dcpu16 chips in them), tools to mount on the robots, and so on. Lots of stuff! Simple stuff. Stuff one can hook into a dcpu16 and make them dance.

I had an idea for an unmanned cargo stowage ship that I'll leave floating in some seldom traveled location.  All systems will be off (including life support) except for a cloaking shield.  When a friendly vessel approaches its coordinates (which will be change periodically) they can send a signal to the cloaked depot (a simple password that changes frequently) and it will decloak and all systems will turn on.

Basically, empowering the player, and also putting some constraints, making the whole system a little more interesting, injecting in a little challenge, by trying to make sure theres no one route, better than any other.

In the beginning, with all the basics, power, computer etc, not too big, not too fast, but simple, the way you design ships, you manually build the systems form scratch. 

Before i get onto the topic, theres a multitude of ways of working around this, prebuilt modules, construction companies (player or npc), expanding the first ship, etc, take your pick.

Rather than some bastardisation of QTEs and minigames, is a testament to how well you built it. An example of of why i think this could be REALLY fun: Imagine that you've taken damage to your rear engine, and it goes offline, so you pop out of the ship for a minute, wearing your spacesuit, propel yourself to the back of the ship, and take a look at the engine. What could be the problem? Glance in, and its destroyed some covers, and go start placing down some new support, your engine would have dropped right off.

I should mention, at least for this kind of task, so i tried to avoid them as much as physically possible.

Anyway, you'd need to try it to see which is a better system), and then you start placing down pipes to connect the storage container to a machine, or a dispenser, or even the engines, if you're desperate for some fuel.

The website mentions in the hopeful feature section ""Space battles against the AI or other players. "" Which I guess doesn't necessarily mean ship to ship combat, neutralize it, then board it and let the fun begin.

I would like to first preface this post by saying I am in no means trying to discourage the community or smacktalk the game. I am here trying to promote an open honest discussion on the topic.


So, it will require a subscription.


Now, to whom this will not effect. I think there is a fairly large core of gamers who enjoy the single player experience. I can understand that. However, with Minecraft, my interest has been and always will be in the multiplayer. I get lonely in single player, it's not the type of game I have fun playing alone.


I am not trying to directly relate 0x10c to Minecraft. but I pose the question: do you really feel a subscription fee will be worth it? and furthermore


is that in any way fair or reasonable? I was an early adopter for Minecraft


I'm not saying this is going to be the same scenario, or let alone on the game. which is part of my issue with this.


why is Notch so sure on subscriptions? is it because he feels this will allow him to pool more resources and provide smoother updates more frequently? or is it because of the insane amount of revenue that could be generated in a few months alone because he already has his target market?


Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to call Notch out and say he is 'going in it for the money'

So far

On the other hand

Yet, I'm a little sketchy on the science of this, so feel free to correct me if this is impossible or anything, but what about something like this: 

Every player has a ""connection box"" of sorts, with, say, 1000 receiving pairs (all linked to everyone else's pairs). These pairs would be set up in a way that data is transferred in binary back to each computer through the pairs, with a sort of integrated circuit like system that makes that transfer. Somehow (internally to this device - this is something I'm a little sketchy on but I imagine is possible - feel free to expand here (or anywhere else for that matter)), when you send a code, you will connect to that specific, your ""connection box"" will modify your ""communication box""'s entangled pair(s) to only be connected to anyone else's entangled pairs that sent the same bit code in their connection box. Then, possibly the communication box could have a little bit pattern at the start that specified how many people were connected, which would be fun for

Would some system like this be possible? What would the limits on a system like this be? Is 32 bits of identification too little - or too much? And, maybe just in some specific ways?

The DCPU and the group of people surrounding it is amazing

We have a DCPU specification which is what the majority of it is based around

My hopes for change in the coming days in regards to the DCPU are as thus.

**What I hope for**
*Revision of the specification*
I hope to see notch tap into the overwhelming ability of all those long time designers and writers of assembly out there

**Why this may not happen**
*Public outcry*
We have people that have designed the foundations of Operating Systems already
*Complexity*
Revising the specification requires some complex choices
*Lack of resource*
notch may not know whos advice to follow or trust in. There are so many voices in a crowd. This may be the biggest issue.

**What I hope for**
*Revision in the display system.*
I hope to see the glyph limitation of being 4 by 8 lifted. I would hope to see at least 6 by 12
The number of tiles is an interesting issue, which is 4 words. However, However that is not really an issue. Each OS can define its own memory location with tiles for graphics useage. Thus allowing the graphics system to just pull the data from a pointer.
But this cuts into the limited memory we are allowed

Additionally, 5 bit 6 bit 5 bit color codes.

On a final note here
However this would require interrupts

**Why this may not happen**
*Public outcry*
People are set in their ways and resist change. But for a game so early in its development

That way if this project gets off the ground there is a central resource where the team can review and discuss ideas.

There are a couple of strong arguments for using an existing engine instead of coding one from scratch. First is that the game gets into a playable state faster. Coding an engine takes a long time. Just ask the people working on the [spout voxel engine](https://www.spout.org/). They have been doing almost pure engine work for over a year and they still are not done.

The second is the argument that coding an engine from scratch is some how more robust than existing solutions.

I am not so much the combat type
I am going to try to find a good asteroid belt and a nearby space station

My idea:

 • Drone 'Fleet'

 
 -These drones will be small
 
-I will have an even amount of them.

 -Since they are small

 -They will be cheap
 
-They will be given a small cargo container and a small engine

 -There will be a Drop off point on my ship near the cargo-bay.
 
  • Command Ship

  
 -This will house me
 
(Option 2: If there are mining lasers

 -The ship will be at best nog bigger than 800 Meters/1 KM.
 
(Note: My crew will exist of 4; 3 Friends and Me.
 
 It will feature 4 Stations:
 
 -Basic Things: Engines, etc.

 -Drone Controll: This will controll the drones
 
-Captain's Station: This console will be offline mostly, etc.

 -Electronic Warfare: In the case we are attacked
 
 • Plans


 -Me and my friends gather in our basic ship.

 -We fuse our ships together (Assuming this is possible)

 -We mine untill we have the required resources.

 -We build the ship

 -We sell our goods
 
 • Crew

 
 -As i said
 
 Me; The captain of the ship.

 Miguel; Best friend

 Mirko; This guy is your average WoW player

 Mike; This guy is your typical 'engineer'
  
 I know this is all based on ideas and toughts, along with my friends.

The green

When the buzzing stopped the table housing the human began to hum gently.  The dim blue lights on the interior of the glass casing slowly shifted to purple then to red.  They slowly grew in intensity matched by the humming that emanated from the bowels of the machinery underneath the table.  By the time the luminosity of the lights had reached its peak nearly an hour had passed.  Each of the human's limbs twitched rhythmically.  Another hour passed as the frequency and the strength of the twitches increased.

The twitching stopped.  The humming stopped.  The lights on the table turned off.

After ten seconds of complete silence gears within the table began to turn.  A quiet cranking sound echoed off the steel walls of the small

The table stopped at a 67.5 degree angle in relation to the floor.  For several uneventful minutes it stayed motionless.

The main monitor on the console flashed solid green then went black.  A thin

After the heart rate stabilized the screen returned to blackness and the glass cover on the table slid open with a hiss.

""Well

Harvey stood in awe of the miracle of modern science that stood before him.  In less than 24 hours he had gone from sweating nervously at the interview to being prepped for spaceflight.  They said they needed him.  That they could not compete with the Russians without him.  While all of this was indeed flattering

None of that mattered though

Harvey stuck his hand into his pocket and retrieved his wallet.  He opened it and pulled out a small photograph of his wife and three year old son

He stuck the photograph back into his wallet and his wallet back into his pocket.  He couldn't afford to think about his family right now.  He would see them tomorrow before leaving.  There were more important things at stake here.  The Soviets could not succeed.  They could not unlock the secrets of gravity manipulation

But, and had been for many years.  It seems that behind the Iron Curtain the good doctor had his fair share of success.  He had been able to demonstrate, on a small level, that infinite energy was not a myth.  It was very much a reality.

His eyes snapped open and his body tensed.  He looked around frantically but his body did not move.  After a brief moment his mouth slowly opened to nearly its full extent and he sharply inhaled until his lungs were full.  He held his breath for a moment before releasing the air trapped within his lungs slowly and steadily.  His body relaxed.

The naked man pressed his arms against the table behind him and pushed himself forward.  He was struggling.  He managed to lift his upper torso forward enough so that he was completely upright.  He breathed heavily again and looked around.  Save for his breath it was completely silent.  He leaned farther forward and extended his left leg.  He pressed his foot onto the white

This will be based on the classic battle ship game.  It will be played across radio communication.  Each side will need a Client program.


**Design Issues involved:**

*Communications have not been specified yet.
*There is no central trusted server to run the game on.
*Each side will likely have the ability to modify their client to their advantage where possible.



**Game rules:**

Setup-One player will run the battleship client and invite another player to join.  The player doing the inviting gets first move as motivation to offer.  The exact way that the inviting will work will depend on how radio communications are implemented.  Ther other player will run the game client and receive the offer and (presumably) accept.  The players will then be presented with a tile based grid that will likely fill the screen.  Using the arrow keys to move and space bar to turn


When finished each client will send a checksum code to the other side to the other client.  This checksum will be used at the end to verify that ship locations were not moved mid battle.  The checksum also verifies that the other side is ready to begin.


Players take turns selecting squares on the grid to shoot.  The client will send the coordinate

1350074612.0,11dts2,Does anyone else see 0x10c as more of a platform than a game?,runvnc,14,14,10,"The reason I say that is because A) it is extremely flexible since you can actually program the computers and B) it has a HUGE fanbase even before any release

What I keep thinking is

And then add maybe one other difficult thing: an open modding system that you could use to add new devices to the DCPU or to modify the planet rendering or whatever.  Then you would have a small set of approved mods that have been carefully tested and selected and would be allowed on official Mojang servers.

The way you would control the gameplay for Mojang servers would be by selecting and creating mods.  So that way you can have control and create a polished game while at the same time allowing all of these geniuses to have maximum flexibility.  Also that way, rather than being based on some decompiled bytecode and not based on an actual understanding of the game engine.

Mostly separate optional idea: why not add a store where people can pay $.99 or $5 or whatever for a mod if they think it is really good?  That gives Mojang a way to have a constant source of fresh content/features and new revenue opportunities (Mojang takes a percentage of each mod sale) and a way for all of the enthusiastic developers to be rewarded for their efforts.

The store is just an extra idea I am throwing out there.  Maybe it would be better to just have an easy way to list and install free mods

  .

  I'm sad about 0x10c

  .

  By day, restaurants and bars.  I use open source technology to teach business owners how to build things like digital signage and small scale inventory systems.  I do 'movies in the park' for local communities.  I've been around a computer once or twice, I guess.

  .

  I stopped playing video games.  During the day

  .

  So out of nowhere, first the standard mining/farming gameplay then the redstone.  I make a handful of automated chicken farms, some elevators.  My greatest redstone achievement: a small ALU.  You're poking at the inner parts now, expanding my mind on not only WHAT circuit does, but WHY it does it and how it can be a smaller part of a larger process.  So I download Redpower and ComputerCraft and spoiled myself and essentially walked away from the logic.  After all, why not program a general purpose device like ComputerCraft running Lua instead of trying to build all the circuits I need by hand?  Well, it separates you from the actual nuts and bolts of the process you're running.

  .

  ZOMG 0x10c ZOMG announcement, moving from statically mapped hardware in memory (Anybody remember 0x8000 and how nobody had really used enough memory yet for that arbitrary address to become a problem? ['64k is enough for anybody!']) to an interrupt mechanism, where every device has full access to RAM and registers.  Different groups release a bunch of compilers, emulators, assemblers, linkers.  /u/xNotch releases a few puzzles to keep us occupied.  That damn pulsar thing drove me nuts, but /r/0x10c cracked it.  DCPU machine code is mildly stable

  .

  At this point, putc, print, newline, atoi/itoa really give you a perspective of the scale of an operating system.  Just try to implement a software memory mapper from scratch in assembly...it's a challenge.  So now I've got this kernel that supports everything I can think of and nothing to use it for.  The only officially released gameplay-related device is the Sleep Chamber.  So my userland has a killer spc-control program but not much else besides standard administrivia related to a running workstation. 

  .

  Sadly, not worth your time.  Months ago, you'd stay up late into the night to implement the drivers for your filesystem specification, but you know you couldn't justify wasting any time on it now.

  .

  I'm sad because I'm worried that I won't learn about trajectories, virus engineering and all the other stuff that would come with me being able to connect my DCPU to other peoples' DCPUs.  I guess I could read about all of that stuff but it's just so much more FUN learning it this way.

  .

  It is a great idea.  Hopefully it hasn't burnt out yet.  I miss you
