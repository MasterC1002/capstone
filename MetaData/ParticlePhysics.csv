I'm just a lowly pop science enthusiast with very little formal education in the physics arena

This

My understanding is that this diagram represents the creation of light?  Or at least the creation of a photon after annihilation.  Can anyone elaborate on if this?

But my real questions come after.  

-What is the cause of the photon's decay?
-Once the photon has decayed into two quarks
-The biggest mystery to me
-Finally

Any answers are very much appreciated.  My apologies for lack of understanding what are probably grade school concepts for most of you.

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are professional scientists or amateurs/enthousiasts with at least a graduate-level familiarity with the field of their choice. The purpose of the panel is to add a certain level of authority to AskReddit answers. Anybody can answer any question, we hope it'll be regarded as more reliable or trustworthy than the average post by an arbitrary redditor. 

You may want to join the panel if you:

* Are a research scientist professionally, are working on a science-related MS, or have gathered a large amount of science-related experience through work or in your free time.
* Are willing to subscribe to /r/AskScience.
* Are happy to answer questions that the ignorant masses may pose about your field.

1366757394.0,1cyw7v,Need help from RooFit!,manlara,10,4,7,"Hi all
I've neer posted here before but hopefully someone can help.
I am using RooFit to do a simultaneous fit to 3 histograms.
The pdf I am using is a Gaussian+1st order polynomial
There is an example macro at $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit/rf501_simultaneouspdf.C

The three histograms share the same and CONSTANT mean and width.
Each gaussian also shares the same and FLOATING parameter multiplying the gaussian.
The 1st order polynomials constant and linear terms are different

To achieve this in RooFit I am doing

  RooGenericPdf*   model_1   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_1"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_1, *b_1 )) ;
  RooGenericPdf*   model_2   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_2"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_2, *b_2 )) ;
  RooGenericPdf*   model_3   = new RooGenericPdf(""model_3"",    RooArgList(*unknownbf, *x,*a_3, *b_3 )) ;

I then make a category link it to RooDataHist objects

  RooCategory tagCat(""tagCat""
  
  map&lt;string
tagCat.defineType(""Mode1"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode1 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_1"", htot_1)  ;
modemap[""Mode1""]  = hmode1  ;
  tagCat.defineType(""Mode2"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode2 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_2"", htot_2)  ;
modemap[""Mode2""]  = hmode2  ;
  tagCat.defineType(""Mode3"")  ; 
RooDataHist* hmode3 = new RooDataHist( ""HMode_3"", htot_3)  ;
modemap[""Mode3""]  = hmode3  ;
  
  RooDataHist* combData = new RooDataHist(""combData"",Index(tagCat),Import(""Mode_1"",*hmode1),Import(modemap)) ;


RooSimultaneous* simPdf = new RooSimultaneous(""simPdf""

  // Associate model with the mode 1 and mode 2
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_1
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_2
  simPdf-&gt;addPdf(*model_3

I then

RooFitResult* r_gauss = simPdf-&gt;fitTo(*combData

And plot

TCanvas* cgauss1 = new TCanvas(""Gauss 1"",400) ;
    cgauss1-&gt;Divide(3) ;

RooPlot* frame1  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100), Slice(tagCat,""Mode1""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(1) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame1-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame1-&gt;Draw() ;
    RooPlot* frame2  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100), Slice(tagCat,""Mode2""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(2) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame2-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame2-&gt;Draw() ;
    RooPlot* frame3  = x-&gt;frame(Bins(100), Slice(tagCat,""Mode3""), ProjWData(tagCat,*combData)) ;  cgauss1-&gt;cd(3) ; gPad-&gt;SetLeftMargin(0.15) ; frame3-&gt;GetYaxis()-&gt;SetTitleOffset(1.4) ; frame3-&gt;Draw() ;
    cgauss1-&gt;Print(filename+""_gauss_1.jpg"") ; 

Nothing crashes and it seems fine but the giveaway that something is not being plotted correctly is that the size of the gaussians of the 3 fits are not the same. A big problem

I'm currently a junior physics major at a university in the USA.  I'm here to see what advice you may have to give me regarding what I do this summer and what I do in the future.  First let me explain.  

I don't know any scientists really and we've never had one in the family.  In fact, but rather I might prefer going into academia, getting the Ph.D., the whole shebang.  I really fell in love with high energy particle and I'm trying to plan out the next few years right.  

I've forgone internships for the past two summers (after freshman year I worked manual labor and after sophomore year I studied abroad in China)

The options:  
1) (the one I've pretty much decided on) Stay in the city my university is in
2) Take an REU somewhere near where I live and make a little more money
3) Do something else.  

Other factors:  
•Money is not an issue for me.  I don't have a lot of it at all but my schooling is paid for mostly by scholarships, and then by loans I don't plan to worry about until I can.    
•My research advisor and I get along extremely well.  In fact
•My grades are good.  I have above a 3.85 GPA right now.  
•My housemate might stay in the city as well over the summer

I think that's everything.  Any and all advice (including grad school stuff or cool stories) is greatly appreciated.  Mainly I'd like to know how actual physicists do things and how you guys would have decided if you were me.  I'll try to come back through the day and give more details if you want to know them.  You guys rock.

There are probably many answers to this because it is inherently a subjective question, in information theory it is characterized as uncertainty. I've also heard it characterized as disorder. Anarchists would say chaos.

So what is the practicable characterization of entropy to physicists? Would this differ between an experimentalist versus a theorist? And would it differ across quantum versus classical?

I say that we do not have sufficient resolution in our detection equipment to tell one electron from another and all we are noticing is that they can move inter-dimensionally. I think we shot one at a target and on the way there it may have gone somewhere else and another one very near it (in some dimension or universe for that matter) had taken its place but was not exactly on the same trajectory because at a subatomic level when dealing with something that can move inter-dimensionally you still have the possibility that another electron from somewhere else was pulled into your observation area only because something flew past it with similar mass and gravity pulled on it for that split second which sent it along a very near trajectory to the electron you shot (jumping dimensions on the way). If we had high speed film on the order of 33 million frames per second and a lens that could actually see a single electron very precisely (that time will come) we could somehow mark that electron and then shoot it at a target and track its path the make sure it did not ""leave"" and hit the exact same place we aimed it,self,

Yesterday while doing some fiddling about I stumbled upon an interesting property that I'm sure is well-known and very intuitive to someone who has a better knowledge of group theory than I do
The space spanned by the Pauli Matrices is closed under SU(2) transformations. That is, given by UMU^-1 , will also be a linear combination of Pauli Matrices. I'm wondering why exactly this is from a group theory perspective.  
I stumbled upon this while proving the SU(2) invariance of the nucleon-pion Lagrangian in search of the conserved current
1) Maybe it's connected to the Pauli Matrices being the generators of the SU(2) group  
2) Maybe it's because the SU(2) transformation works sort of like a rotation of coordinates would, and z axes, they're the Pauli Matrices.  
I hope my question isn't too ignorant and I apologize for any errors or misunderstanding on my part. I'm a student
