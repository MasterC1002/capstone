This subreddit is under new management. The previous mods had not signed in for 9+ months

**Who Am I**

I've been in the online advertising industry since my mid-teens, and done paid advertising (4 years).

**What do I want for this subreddit?**

I'm leaving the direction mostly open to the community. I see my role here mostly as making sure that this subreddit becomes articles about advertising instead of advertisements targeted at advertisers. I'm keeping an eye out

Until we get cleaned up, ""give us your e-mail for content"", etc. I will also be ruthless about anything related to MLM or the ""make money online"" niche. This should be a place to read about advertising, not a place to profit off the users.

**So what would you guys like to see moving forward?**

We have a fair number of users

*Our Immediate Options Appear to Be:*

* Self Posts/Analysis of Interesting Ads and Trends

* Examples of successful or interesting advertisements.

* Articles about the advertising industry

* Question/Answer Threads(I've seen these become relatively popular)

* Innovative new tools and services(this will require a bit of editorial control on my part to keep the spam to a dull roar)

* Content geared towards beginners

* Content geared towards agencies

* Anything else under the sun.

**Who are you guys?**

If you'd like please leave a comment saying a little about yourself and what you do so I can get an idea of what type of person inhabits this subreddit. I'm also interested in any other active advertising subreddits that you may be subscribed to.

-----------------------------

Thanks a bunch everyone. I look forward to trying to build this community up with you.

1359657471.0,17n5a4,How to tell if your ad concept sucks,hathawayshirtman,138,16,37,"One of the best skills you can have is to learn how to recognize a good idea. But before you can recognize a good idea

When you make your concept


- **SOUNDS LIKE A PITCH-MAN**

Obvious salesman-speak:

*""Our company provides the greatest service for you""*

*""He's been using Brand X. Introducing the all-new Brand Y!""*

*""Consumer Reports gives it a five-star rating!""*

*""Act now and get this absolutely free!""*

It can also take forms in other ways:

Asking a question — *""Have too many zits? Then try all-new Zit Creme 1000!""*

Gratuitous displays of scantily-clad women.

Offering money-back guarantees


- **BORING**

This happens when the ad is too straight. There's no ""wink

*""Use Mobile Checking with First Financial Trust.""*


- **TOO EASY**

Miracle Grow made your houseplants push through the roof? You're the 50


- **OVERLY CUTE**

Babies. Talking animals. I know they do this crap on the Superbowl


- **BORROWED INTEREST**

Superheros. Aliens. Sasquatch. Celebrities. They have too much of their own thing going on, at worst, it causes brand confusion (HUGE no-no). This category is repeatedly offended with large agencies—especially with celebrities. You may have to work on a project with one. But don't put it in your book; it shows recklessness with budget, and distracts from the concept. Just because others do it, doesn't mean it's good.


- **FAKE SCENARIO**

These are situations that are either impossible, people are already wary of advertising as it is.

*""Because you're on your fourth latte.""* This is not true; I hate milk and drink only espresso.

*""George kissed his wife and went to work.""* George doesn't exist!

*""Women will notice you.""* Yeah right. (Note that Axe deodorant does this, it would fail.)


- **CONFUSING**

If you have to explain your ad for more than five seconds to the person you're presenting to, or if you're trying to shoehorn a lot of messages into one.


- **TOO WEIRD**

This is a combination of various levels of ""borrowed interest


- **BEEN DONE BEFORE**

It could be the best ad in the world. But if someone else did it (even if you never saw the other ad before)

1369400942.0,1eyvaj,Real advice for newbies (and some oldies) in the industry,startinggl0ry,71,6,23,"First off

Stay passionate. We all have worked long and hard

Dig deep. Learn about your company, your clients' industry. You'd be surprised how little tidbits of information can change an entire strategy and highlight you as an asset in the company. The ones that do this can move quickly-- very quickly. Advertising is probably the only space where you can go from ""assistant"" in your title to ""senior"" in your title within 2 years. 

Take criticism professionally. A rock that has been smoothed by the weathering tends to be more appealing to the eye than one with rough edges. The scrutiny is just helping you smooth out your rough edges. NEVER take it personally

Respect everyone. Juniors, smarties, idiots. Everyone. We all move around a lot in the industry and at the end of the day it's a small community. That guy you just told off? Could be working client side in a couple of years and decide to pass you over or make your life a living hell. (Seen that happen a couple of times now.) Your name is your brand, and it better have a strong positive sentiment behind it if you expect to move high up the ladder. 

Read. Read everything you can get your hands on, the better. In order to be creative, on the creative side, strategy side, media side, etc., you have to be able to draw on a wide base of knowledge. 

Learn (some of) the analytics. It's important to know what your clients and others are judging a campaign on at the end of the day, ""branding"" is a cop out. There is always a more specific goal for every campaign. 

Learn the media. Not just what each media generally works well for, driving your costs up? Is your creative built properly for the inventory you're accessing? Ask these questions, even if it's not necessarily ""your job"". 

Respect the differences between the media team and the creative team. Advertising is art and science, dinner, or go to an upfront,""  OR ""siloed creatives who only care about their pet project even though it doesn't fit anywhere in the actual campaign."" It goes both ways, and all it does is show how naive someone truly is when they make statements like this. 

Appreciate your agency. They invested a lot of time and money in you. It's easy to get a big head in this industry and chase dollars. Let me save you the suspense-- it's much easier to get underpaid to work with people you love than take home big paycheck and hate where you spend 40-70 hours of your life each week. 

I could probably write a lot more

Background: I'm 42. Been in and around agencies of different sizes for... 16 years? I'm old/young enough to be of the first ad generation to be exposed to the web as an ad medium. My first job as a junior copywriter was to be 'digital'. At the time that was banners and text-links.

**How to look for an entry level creative job**: Find out who the CREATIVE SERVICES MANAGER is, unless they're nice people, will kick your stuff to them anyway. They can be a great ally and the best ones are genuinely interested in cultivating talent, especially in 'ad towns'.

**PRINT and TV, very ill.**: Don't worry, there's still plenty of opportunity to go on shoots and eat craft services. The media models are crumbling into the sea. Magazines and TV are still part of the pool, but their share will get smaller and smaller, thus their ROI for clients will get smaller and smaller. The networks are starting to get that, and are just now taking online content development seriously.
If you really want to make yourself useful

**NOT ALL AD SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME:** Creative Circus, are usually a rip-off. (Have you noticed how crappy their ads are? QED, mfer.) If you're interested in design, go to a four college - Rhode Island, Cal Poly SLO, Cranbrook. Note that design and art direction are complimentary disciplines, but a lot of great conceptual art directors can't design their way out of a paper bag.

One thing about ad schools is graduates' books tend to look the same: great headline

Art Directors: learn how to deal with words.

Copywriter: Lean how to write longer chunks of copy. And become familiar how journalism works. Advertising copy is a highly corrupt form of journalism.

**IS AD SCHOOL ESSENTIAL?**: Handy, find out what sort of interaction they have with the local ad community - portfolio reviews, speaker series, whatever.
Personally
If your program offers MFAs in copywriting or art direction 

**KNOW HOW BUSINESS WORKS**: Take a few courses at your local college if you're out of school. You're actually aiming to be a type of business consultant, and their company history - if for no other reason than to not confuse their rival's CEO with their CEO, and then blather on loudly and self-importantly in a meeting with said client, like I have done.

Have a rudimentary understanding of merchandizing, packaging, etc.

**DOES BEING AN MBA HELP?** Helps if you're on the account side

**IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN BEING STUCK IN A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALITY, events, pharmaceutical -- OOF. If you want to do general advertising, hold out until you can get a job at a general agency. It can be tough to get good, universally relatable work out of a speciality shop, so your ambitions are different, avoid these places. It can be difficult to switch out.

**CAN I BE FAMILY ORIENTED?** Some agencies are better than others hours wise. I worked every day for about five month straight at one point, it can be financially annoying when you're loaning money to the agency so you can go on a trip just to do your job, it doesn't care about kids' bdays and wedding anniversary. It's not a universal truth, and different agencies have different cultures, but anyone who has been in the ad business for a while has a horror stories.

**WHAT SORT OF PERSON THRIVES IN ADVERTISING?** Curious people. People who spend a lot of time reading

**ONE MORE THING: THE CONTENT SPECIALIST MAY BE GOING AWAY:** I mean like in ten years or something. Brand agencies will start to evolve more toward branded content studios

That's all I can think of for now. Please don't hesitate to ask questions.

I'm 24 - I want to date, be able to eat dinner before 10pm for once, just live a normal and healthy life - is this unrealistic?  

Yeah

How does anyone raise a family with these hours?

This year has gone by very very quickly, and miserable with a slight substance abuse problem - I'm terrified that I'm going to blink and be 30 sitting in the same studio apartment alone and the only thing to show for it being a better job title and a few more grand in the bank.

***Strategic***


**[Everything is Obvious (Once You Know The Answer)](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B004T4N672)

Watts explains why most planning is bullshit and most of our explanations for results are just post hoc rationalizations.

**[Connected

Book is about network science and explains how almost all of our actions are unwittingly affected by people we know and people we dont know

**[Linked](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V57UX2)

The OG book on Network Theory. It's a bit dated

**[Bursts](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B003KWH13O)

An update to Linked. It seems like part 2 of a 3 part series. It starts to connect a lot of dots

**[Subliminal](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B007NKZ1RW)

A great book on how our emotional brain is responsible for almost all of our decisions. 

**[Predictably Irrational](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V0GCE0)

More on the nuncios/emotional brain. A lot of good research that adds to the theory that our emotional brain is at the core of our decisions and our rational brain is just good at rationalizing those decisions.

**[You're Not So Smart](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B006K4GN56)

Really easy/quick/consumable read. Each chapter is a new common misconception (e.g. The Misconception: We think when we lean something new we remember that we were once wrong about it. The truth: Due to the Hindsight bias we often look back on what we just learned and assumed we knew it the whole time)

**[Grouped](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_10?asin=B006C258Z2&amp;qid=1361979247&amp;sr=1-10)

Very consumable, but the book is more of a synthesis of other peoples research (not that that is a bad thing).

**[The Righteous Mind](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B008O8964Q&amp;qid=1361980538&amp;sr=1-1
)

Haidt opens with the idea that moral intuition is the basis of our decisions and rational thought is just justification of that intuition. He then goes on to describe his moral foundation theory - the idea that our ethics come from 6 basic pillars. 

**[Strategic Truth Lies and Advertising

First off

**[Mythologies by Roland Barthes From 1957](http://www.amazon.com/Mythologies-Roland-Barthes/dp/0374521506)** is a collection of essays around myth creation in modern society through semiotics. Some of it gets a little abstract but I really enjoyed the chapter on soap powder and detergent packaging.

**[Propaganda by Edward Bernays](http://www.amazon.com/Propaganda-Edward-Bernays/dp/0970312598)** If you've seen the Adam Curtis documentary Century Of The Self you'll know all about this guy\book (If you haven't it is a MUST for anyone in media). From today's perspective Propaganda very much on the dark side of mass media\mass persuasion but the dark side is always useful in defining the entirety of a subject. Goebbels loved this book! (OP Comment: Awesome book. Really amazing stuff)

**[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B003C20SZU&amp;qid=1362448046&amp;sr=1-1)** First published in 1841 this book is surprisingly relevant if you're at all interested in the social psychology behind viral campaigns


***Creative***

**[Hey Mr. Whipple
Pretty much an industry standard that will stand the test of time. A must read for any new creative.

**[Made To Stick
From Amazon: In this indispensable guide

**[A Smile In The Mind by Beryl McAlhone and David Stuart One](http://www.amazon.com/Smile-Mind-Beryl-McAlhone/dp/0714838128)** of the best treatises on humour in the communication arts I've ever picked up. More of a design book but the core insights are just as relevant to copywriters. It's also beautifully designed. 

***Client/Business***

First

There seems to be a lot of energy and interest in building this community up, today I'd like to approach 2 things:

**Building a Better Sidebar**

*Similar Subreddits*

We got a few recommendations for similar subreddits yesterday. We will be adding those(r/AdPorn, r/Media) to the sidebar. If there's any others, please leave a comment for those. 

*Blogs

There seems to be demand for a lot of different types of content here. If you guys have any websites that put out exceptional articles on advertising

I'm going to be reviewing each of these by hand before they go up. Please resist the urge to submit blogs that are run by the company you work for or clients


**User Flair/Specialties**

We had some people who were kind enough to share their job titles yesterday, please post here with the information.

We're looking for things like ""Graphics Design"", and optionally the company you work for. Allowing the company name is kind of an experiment; hopefully by giving people a way to comment with that added we can help make posting here something that is actually constructive for business we can avoid spammy and self-serving submissions. If you're like me and would prefer not to have the company listed, that's also fine.

Thanks a bunch everyone!

I'm a strategic planner at one of the largest ad agencies...been thinking about the likes/dislikes of working in an agency. **What are yours?** 

Mine

**What do I like about it?**

I love talking to people and getting new insights and behaviors from them. Things that might be painstakingly obvious that I brushed over

I love brainstorming. Getting to hear ideas from other people and building on top of each other. I love the teamwork aspect. I love the respect that comes out of a good brainstorm. (On the dislike part

I like the excitement when you see a good creative work from an idea. 

I like the pitch process (I know

I like understanding business issues and how to answer to that. I like the reminder that we are in this not only for creative purposes

**What do I dislike about it?**

I dislike the bullshit factor. I knew that when I was going into this industry

I dislike the egos. We’re in an industry that straddles art and commerce

I dislike the judgment. We’re also in the business of judging. Not simply judging ads and creative work

The heartbreaking de-motivation when an idea becomes scratched and re-written to its skeletal core. What was something beautiful with great potential is unappreciated. While I understand that ad people sometimes are too “creative” and become dis-engaged with general public

I can't help but roll my eyes whenever I hear/see one on the radio or on TV. They all seem extremely obvious and the context of how they make the segue into their product makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all. The commercials all seem confused too. Theyre all shot cinematically

 Here's your typical McDonalds commercial: Random un-related dilemma between main character and other character. ""I just bought (item) for a buck on the McDonalds Dollar Menu. So I must be smart! DERP DERP"". Main character then solves said problem.

....Wow, its the fact that youre thinking about it"".  Bullshit. I rarely eat fast food but I must say, McDonalds makes some tasty shit, THAT is the selling point for me not some quirky little bullshit scenario that makes absolutely no sense. McDonalds should be emphasizing more on describing the taste and quality of their product, NOT coming up with a shitty [""Oh You!""](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/oh-you-show.jpg) exchange between two nimrods.

The thing that really made me realize they've hit rock bottom, okay theyre capitalizing on mainstream America's recent asphyxiation with british accents (seriously wtf is up with that). But further analyzing I realized the irony of using the cockney accent because I'm pretty sure that a cockney accent is the british equivalent of an american southern accent or heavy new york accent (working class) which doesnt really coincide with the stereotypical ""smart"" accent. Not only that but they are stereotyping the british accent as a sign of intelligence. Not to say that british citizens arent intelligent, but it would be like him using a New York accent and saying ""im trying to sound like I'm in the mob"". All this commercial has done is ruin my fuckin day, I dont want mcdonalds at all, I just want these awful commercials to stop.

* It's long hard work for little pay - where is the dream job I thought I would have?

* People don't like my ideas or respect me!

* How long until I get a promotion?

* Are all agencies full of meanies?

So here is a bit of advice. Now it might sound cruel

Advertising is fucking tough. You either have it or you don't. Time and tenure doesn't earn you respect

The point it

Now

What I'm saying is that if you watched Mad Men and thought ""I want to be DON!"" or ""I want to be Peggy"" well here's a reality check. These are the 5%ers. And people can tell pretty damn quickly whether you are in this category or not. 

As for respect, there's the fucking door."" Seriously. If you're feelings get hurt because someone didn't like your idea / headline / layout / brief / strategy - perhaps you aren't cut out for this gig. 

I once had an ECD say to me, yeah - it stung a bit. But I pulled my shit together, nodded my head and said ""Yup - she was pretty bad."" And I moved the fuck on. 

Honestly

The number of people who were in my year at Ad School and are still working in the industry is 3. 3 Out of 30.

&gt;Making an ad requires constant trashing and editing. When you're starting out, you're trying too hard."" ""No, I don't get it."" ""No, that's a long way around."" ""No, that's not surprising enough."" ""No, you're not thinking of the business problem.""
That feedback (the instruction) is

I think it would be cool if we put together a list of the questions we ask ourselves while doing creative advertising work. Here are mine with DatLe_ArtDirector's included:

Edit: Updates 8-9-2012

* Has it been done before?
* Are you trying too hard?
* Is it easy to ""get it""?
* Is it the shortest ""route""?
* Does it ""pop""
* Does it solve the business problem?
* Does the viewer have something to take away
* Is it cool or interesting enough to share?
* Is the product synonymous with the activity?
* Is there relationship or identity with product depicted in ad for others to recognize?
* Do ideas match copy (vice versa)
* Is the ad ambiguous? It shouldn't be!
* Does it work without brand familiarity?
* Does it make people think too much?
* Does it quickly communicate the idea?
* Is it obvious what to do/buy?
* Do I like it? (kittnzNrainbowz)
* Creative Directors look at hundreds of campaigns each week. Will this stand out? (leemfg)
* Is it aligned with the brand tone/philosophy? (cleverkid)
* Is it on Strategy? (theirisnetwork)
* If it's a spec ad
* After seeing the ad can you understand it in less than five seconds? Remember that we aren't creating art
* When making billboard copy
* When making a banner ad
* When doing a guerrilla ad
* When making anything interactive
* ""So what?"" You mocked up an ad
* If it is a tactic

So I'm offering up some rambling advice based on my experience* in interviewing a lot of people. I hope this is helpful and others can add more in the comments.

-

**THE WORK**

What I'm looking to see in your work:

**1** - You can come up with ideas that exist in the intersection between 4 spaces: the brand

**2** - You can bring these ideas to life

**3** - You can sell these ideas to me.

I guess some CDs are only looking for #2 in juniors. For me

#3 is big. Don't leave me to flip through your portfolio in silence

Work out in advance the best way to sell each piece very quickly. Some work is best presented as ""ta-dah!""

Don't bring too much work. Bring 5-6 ideas and only present enough so I get the idea

Invent fake work! If you feel your work does not show ideas as described #1 above

If I offer constructive criticism

Don't limit it to print ads and TV/radio scripts. I want to see you understand modern advertising - ideas that go where the audience is and engages them.

Include other things that are not ads but show you understand engagement and/or cutting edge technology. I interviewed a guy (through this subreddit) who was a world-ranked gamer. He wouldn't have told me if I hadn't asked. It should have been in his book! Made a minecraft level that 100

Don't be negative - about your work, other agencies. Again, an alarm bell goes off.

-

**THE PERSON**

I don't care what you wear or look like. I don't care if you're shy or confident. 

I DO care that:

- You are a stable, downer or asshat. I gotta work with you every day.
- You listen, but you must be able to communicate intelligently.
- You are really keen. Show me you've done your homework about me

Don't bullshit. Don't present ideas that aren't yours

Please add more or ask questions...

* I've been confusing the forrest for the trees. In cases like the Energy Porn and Fifa (both) they would probably work as *part* of a bigger concept
* I need to integrate the design from the get-go. Someone noted it needs work and I believe this came from a convoluted process where design was an afterthought. It takes me longer
* I should start using known brands. This will probably help me create cleaner copy since I will be working with a previously established mythology of sorts (culture, but it will be a better exercise at the moment.

So I got this summer job at a local museum, and 18), the town does this big thing called Jamboree Days, we are on the outskirts of town and do our own thing that coincides with that called Harvest Days (we're a hick town, this used to be a tractor club and was converted into a museum).

**For Background:** This museum is a non-profit thing run by old people who used to be farmers and love tractors. There are plenty of buildings on site (old school, etc.), and many antiques of all kinds. 

**What I do:** I'm one of their first ever hired employees, there would be a place for someone to go to see what was done, and how it was done. Part of this job, which my boss asked me to do because I'm ""young and probably more savvy with all this news and computer stuff"" was to advertise for any events, the main one being Harvest Days.

**What I've already done:**

* Contacted the two local news stations about getting on the news to promote it, longer one, after the weather where local, small-time people can speak about events and things that they're doing (ex. new band playing at a local bar). I've only e-mailed today, and I have 9 weeks, so I figure that's a start at least. 

* Talked to the guy who does our posters, so I guess I can't contradict him if he knows what he's talking about. 

**What more I plan on doing:**

* distrubuting all our posters all over town and to any tourist places in the area
* contacting the local newspapers to place ads
* There's another town nearby that has a newsletter instead of a paper
* Some how on the internet

**My main questions for you:** 

* Is there anywhere on Reddit where I can advertise for this thing? Like I said, it would really help out a lot.

* Are my ideas so far on the right track? Is there anything more I should be doing

* What kind of timeline should I be using for this? I have 9 weeks right now

* Are there other ways I could be promoting this event that is low-cost?

* I'm seriously open to any advice you guys have

I need to move. I’d be willing to put up with the perennial late nights


As the sole planner of the agency (I have around a year’s experience and was promised a mentor, but they are anything but – any quantitative and qualitative research I use consists of stuff I can scrounge off the internet; whatever strategic direction I suggest is brought into a group meeting of creative directors, executives, VPs, you name it, to be ignored and replaced by a one-word strategy made up on the fly to justify the consensual creative direction. The latest “strategy” was “we care”. My job has essentially become making the creative executions backwards-compatible with said “strategy”, then sugarcoating the entire thing for client consumption.


I love my job when I’m allowed to do it well, is demeaning and frustrating. I’ve brought the issue up with the head of the agency, who just told me to work “less by the book”.


Rant over. 


I’ve decided I want to move away from Italy (where I am currently) and look for opportunities elsewhere, the UK, etc. (I’m pretty open as to where to go) to look for a job – I have to hunt from here. 


Any advice on how to best go about it? Any countries/cities/agencies you think would be forthcoming?

I have been working in national and local ad sales in a smaller market (around 100 DMA Rank) and have always had the ambition to go to a bigger market. Circumstances have changed here with acquisitions and I feel that this is my opportunity to get out of this small town where advertising doesn't ""flourish"". For example

I didn't go to Miami Ad School. I studied advertising and have a passion for it. I adapt very quickly and really want to succeed in this business. I am currently updating my resume to include all of the national agencies (McCann, etc.) that I work with in broadcast television daily, projects I have started/completed, etc. in the past 2 years I have been working in ad sales here. 

I just wanted to get some feedback from people who are either in larger cities (Chicago is my first choice) or have come from smaller DMAs and got into the advertising scene. I have the confidence that I can do anything the big city has to offer and just thinking about the opportunities is putting a smile on my face. 

Let me know your experiences and what you all have been through in order to break into the big city agencies. 

Thanks in advance!
