It was tragic watching Adams fall this episode, and I can just relate to the character so easily.  All season we've seen him since the cops were called, he's been putting a shirt on, both physically and metaphorically.  He's been putting on a show of his life being put together, or as best as someone as broken as he is see's put.  There is so much in the world that everyone else ignore's that he notices, and so much they care about that he doesn't but he's trying to understand the way everything works.  Sometimes, he fails (like the Dog) and sometimes

But the thing is, and completely unnecessary in every utilitarian sense except warmth.  I'm sure the only reason he wears pants is for pockets and legality.  He was bound to snap back into shirtless Adam mode, and it all started with Hannah.  All season long he'd been trying to act as normal as possible, and that was even reflected in his shirts, like the Dog episode he's wearing a cut off tshirt, like... the bare minimum of shirtness.  Around Natalia, he had even started wearing... *collars*.  He was becoming normal, and he went *way* to far.


Lets go back to him and Natalia having sex the first time.  He says ""I love how clear you are with me"" but what I heard was ""I hate that you have these tiny rules, humiliating, and satisfying sexual relationship of my past... where every weird desire was explored.  And you don't like soft touching?  What the fuck am I supposed to do?""  

But he saw Hannah, to be raw, to that *weirdo* that he's always wanted to be.  I promise you, when he was getting off on Hannah pretending to be a preteen streetwalker, that was more about just seeing what that would be like... with Hannah, because he trusted her to not get weirded out by that.  And all those emotions and feelings came back.  He wanted to be weird.  He wanted to be honest and raw.  He wanted to be *shirtless*.

So he drinks, and he does his raw weird thing.  He was hoping Natalia would open up, and get weird to.  He was hoping that she would expose some totally embarrassing, thought or desire or want... or at least connect and play along with his debasing because hey... she didn't care if he is that weird kid.  He was hoping to have an emotional connection with her and it went just about as awfully as it could of gone (hopeful rape roleplay ending up more just rape and all)

I feel really bad, and no one understood.

**TL;DR:  Adam has been putting on a shirt (metaphor) all season, like not wanting to wear a shirt.  Hannah was the last to validate his sexual eccentricities, and Natalia couldn't (understandably so).  Adam is just a weird kid who doesn't like weird shirts, has some hangups, and just wants someone to understand him**

**TL;DRer: Adam knows he's weird

The theory goes that parts of the show are 'real' and parts of the show are what Hannah is writing.  That there are two separate worlds, Ray, Hannah, Adam and Charlie are real but Charlie and Adam are just ex-boyfriends that Hannah is now writing about.

Anyways

The rest of the stuff - Marnie and Charlie getting together

I don't think the women are just spinless idiots with no self worth, I feel like they make poor choices and want validation.  The guys aren't great characters, the most likable of them (Charlie) is probably my least favorite and the least likable (Adam) is my favorite.  But that's because it's a comedy, and I watch it to laugh.  Why do people have to analyze it like this show has said ""This is how all adults act, this is where society is going, choose your side""?

The thing about Girls that I love is it acknowledges the crazy in all of us. Hannah tries so hard to find a balance between loving herself as a person, that quest, to strike balance. It is such a beautiful scene because it is truly so raw and vulnerable. To be held in that moment of pure ugliness, self hate and questioning that Hannah is experiencing when Adam runs to her, is so comforting that it reminds us of the moments we have wanted and needed that. 

Lena is such a genius. She pulls out what is complexly beautiful in the female (and human in general) soul and shows that there are so many angles at which to see it

That relates to what I'm talking about. As Season 2 goes on I more and more feel the hand of Dunham, just a show, in my opinion I'm starting to feel her bleed into the material too much. Given that she also acts in the show which I do not object to, it might be difficult for me to articulate this, but I'm starting to become self-aware too often, to the point where Dunham herself may be overshadowing her character.

However, and Ray was made to blow up so Hannah could have an excuse to go over to apologize (I very much doubt she would've gone over if Ray handled that calmly). But we still have the rest of the season to see how this all turns out.

Evidence: 

(1) She puts up a front.  In S1 she tried to convince that dude that she's not the type to get attached


(2) She is insecure.  I feel like that point is obvious.  She tries pretty hard to get people to really like her.  She tries hard to fit in.  Very accommodating to others.


(3) No one is actually close to her.  People prone to suicide tend to be driven there by loneliness.  She tries hard to make it seem like she is not lonely but her true nature is that she gets overly attached very fast


(4) Ray.  He has the potential to make her do crazy shit.  The emojis demonstrate that she has these overly attached girlfriend tendencies that drive men away


(5) Passive cries for help.  Although she is putting up this front, and the pain driving you to suicide.  I consider it clear because it more or less is Shoshanna in a nutshell.  No one really paid attention to her in the midst of the party, and people just think of her as this comic relief.  Her passive, vague message alluding to suicide was ignored by everyone.


**So I predict that Season 2 will be some quasi-romance between her and Ray that means way more to her than it does to him, giving the show a serious punctuation and the characters feel guilty about not being truly attentive to her.  She might even deny that it was deliberate (if she survives) and probably the reason that the suicide attempt fails will be because of something kind of funny**",,False,self,t5_2qj0h,False,,

1364015935.0,1augcb,Girls: why I love it (and hate it) and why you should too,toyfulskerl,11,5,2,"This is going to be long

One of the reasons why I love Girls so much, I hear a lot of people say ""I had an experience kind of like that"" when they talk about Girls. To watch so much of my previous relationships played out on the TV screen is painful; my understanding of myself, and my own 'Hannah', informs my understanding of so much of the inner life of the characters on the show. For example, where so many people on the net had trouble understanding why Joshua would accept Hannah into his home and life the way he did, I had no such difficulty. I have **been** Joshua, I know exactly what he saw in Hannah, I also am intimately familiar with the feelings of loss Joshua felt when he came home from work that day to find his house immaculate and empty. I feel like I know these characters

Let's talk about the entire series first, that situation is only there to allow the characters to explore their relationships with one another. To understand the characters, we need to understand their relationships.

Let's start with Shoshanna and Ray. Shoshanna is young and inexperienced, and is unhappy with the place that he's found in the world (and just the world in general).  To really understand Shoshanna you must realize that her mental life has her wanting to take the role of one of the characters from ""Sex and the City""; to Shoshanna SatC is everything that is cool about being a woman in NYC, she wants her life to be that cool, ergo, the more like SatC her life is, the cooler she is. Shoshanna can easily imagine Marnie and Jessa being characters from the show and repeatedly bores them with those rambling fantasies. When it comes to Ray, however, Ray does (for some inexplicable reason to her) seem to like her and want to be around her. He seems to find something in her that she doesn't see herself and that is a powerful attractant.

At least

Ray is bitter, with a shitty job and no aspirations. I can easily understand Ray because I've been him. He's attracted to Shoshanna because she's the exact opposite of him and her effervescence and drive are charming, even as they are somewhat annoying. Shoshanna still has the enthusiasm that has been beaten out of Ray by life and, by being around her, he can borrow some of that enthusiasm. He finds drive within himself, not because he wants to make himself better, but because he wants to be better *for* Shosh. He finds renewed hope through her. And this is exactly the right time, for Shoshanna to go chasing after her dreams of being a character from SatC; Ray might actually be good for her (as she is for him)

Now we have Jessa. Through the course of the show we've come to know Jessa pretty well and understand why she is the way she is. I've known a few people like Jessa in my life; the most I've ever been able to achieve with them is 'cordial disdain', Marnie says ""Every time she comes into town, you go on some week-long bender, and then she leaves to go off to her next country and I'm left to pick up the pieces."" What does Hanna see in Jessa? ""I just think she's fun,"" say Hanna. It's not that Hannah doesn't see how self-centered, abusive or self-serving Jessa is, it's that Hannah envies all of the life experiences that Jessa's character faults have brought her. But we'll get back to Hannah in a bit. Jessa's story arc ends early in this season with her devolving back to her normal pattern: when things become too difficult for her (or just not to her liking), abandoning anyone (Hannah in this case) who might have been there helping her. I don't think anyone can deny that Jessa is in a bad place

That brings us to Marnie and Charlie. When we first meet them, doing his best to be the nicest boyfriend ever, has become a smothering blanket. In Charlie's viewpoint however, he's just doing what he's always done, been there for Marnie when she needs him, and done his best to support her emotionally. You can immediately see why Marnie would hate that and she does….at least she does up until she sees that Charlie, after she's dumped him, neither of which she can say for herself. As her professional life plans unravel and she finds that she is neither ""the good friend"" nor considered worthy of being the girlfriend of the guy she's sleeping with, in spite of their Hollywood bullshit ending

And that leaves us with Hannah and Adam, but certainly something to that effect.) But the point of the show isn't that Hannah is 'trying to find her place in the world', Hannah knows what her place should be (she is a writer, ""the voice of her generation""); the conflict comes from the world not recognizing what she holds to be truth and Hannah deciding that the best way of fixing that discrepancy is to 'experience the truth of the world' (which somehow translates as ""Do All The Drugs And Sex!"") The show has been about showing Hannah's skydive into destruction, a destruction that, in so many ways, she really *wants* for herself. While she might not have wanted to be cut off by her parents, ""One Man's Trash"", the things that would allow her to become a good writer, worse

Why would Adam want any part of that? Why did Adam want to be a part of that in the beginning? Hannah was just a hookup. She didn't ask him about his life, that she was unhappy just being a hookup, it must have confused the fuck out of him. And then, once he starts opening up and making her a part of his life, she gets flighty and runs away. The beginning of season two showed just how badly things can get fucked up between the two of them, with Adam not backing off until he is literally arrested for being the 'psycho stalker ex-boyfriend'. Understandably, we can see in S2E4 and S2E9 that Adam still has unresolved feelings about her. So, the craziness of the half-dressed girl walking down the NY streets at night coming back from the ER?

Because she needs some sort of emotional stability in her life and he **sees** that. He **sees** that there is no one else in her life who is helping her, a part that wants to fix things, that wants to do something that feels like it matters. He's already been burned badly by her before, and even knows that she's probably going to burn him badly again in the future, but he just can't *not* try to help. I know what it's like to be the person who can see all the emotional turmoil that another person is going through and find himself unable to resist reaching out to try and help that person.

Hannah **is** going to burn him badly in the end, there is such a thing as a happy writer, but unhappy writers who are driven by their unhappiness are a trope for a reason); given the choice between happiness with Adam or the ability to 'be a voice of a generation' she will choose the latter, just as she did with Joshua. Hannah is narcissistic and a shit-stirrer. She is someone who has to process things several times through her head before she decides on how she feels about it. When she reacts immediately, those reactions tend to be purely emotional, not a reaction with thought behind it, and this is why she seems to throw herself at situations. When she *does* think things through, but that lack of guile doesn't keep her from setting up the people who are in her life for failure. It seems inevitable that

And here's why I hate the ending of this season. It's because, a co-worker, even a random bar hookup), and decides to keep moving forward, focuses on leaving all the craziness of Adam behind, and continues without him. In real life Hannah and Adam never get their Hollywood bullshit reunion.

And it's why I love this ending of the season. Its Hollywood bullshit and I love it because I know, as we put away our soggy tissues and embrace the warm and fuzzy feelings this season finale engendered, that we know Hannah and Adam are in an incredibly bad place and they aren't going to get to enjoy their 'rom-com ending' for long.",,False,self,t5_2qj0h,,http://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/1augcb/girls_why_i_love_it_and_hate_it_and_why_you/

I just finished watching the series last night. I watched it in two blocks: from episode one to episode six


After finishing the sixth episode

**Hannah** has finally committing to being finacially independant

**Marnie** had finally broken free of her long-term relationship

**Jessa** was still working as a nanny



However

**Hannah** is shown to be uncommited to her writing and increasingly unreasonable in her relationships. Even though I felt she was the most likeable out of the three

Even though **Marnie** begins to look more and more desperate in the later episodes, and her thing with Jessa seemed unlikely.

**Jessa's** marriage makes her character seem completely shallow and materialistic. We know that Thomas is an asshole


If the point of the series was to show how unlikeable many 20-something girls are, because I couldn't relate to the characters in the last half of the series, it ceased to be entertaining, and bits that I should have found funny just seemed contrived and unrealistic. 

I'm interested to hear if anyone else had this experience

Thanks.

This season is very different from the version of Girls that we were presented with in season 1. That ""pitch"" was all sex, and 'real' drama. This season was pretty different. Hannah has sex with Laird and that weirdo teenager, then gets OCD and tries to make herself deaf for attention. Marnie tries out something new, then when it fails she freaks and runs back to safe waters. Shoshana and Ray break up. Jessa tries to face down her daddy issues, then just runs away. Etc. It's a downer, but it's all pretty realistic stuff. Life isn't always partying and experimentation all the time, because eventually things settle down and when you reflect back you're not always proud of the things you've done. This is especially true of people in their early 20s, and is forcing us to deal with all of the shitty aspects of life along with the exciting ones.

My thoughts.. 

- Loved the hilarious story around the rabbit 

- Loved how at first Frank looked hipster and edgy and maybe cute

- Jessa's blow up with her dad was really powerful to me. I am in my early twenties and I feel like inside I am freaking out all the time and the inner me is screaming I'm a child, why do I have to pay for my sick dog, why do I have to work until it's dark, don't they all know I'm just a kid?! I thought it was evident that all of us, no matter the age, have a part of us screaming that we're the child and want to be taken care of. You could tell her dad wanted to yell the same thing back at her. 

- Hannah's conversation with her parents

- Purely speculative but towards the end all I could think was WOW Hannah definitely has an STD and then gave it to that weird man baby and something insane is going to happen. But then I remembered he finished on her leg crease. I died laughing

I think that the first couple of episodes Lena paints a really ugly portrait of Adam


Most of the time we don't see real Adam


I tried to be vanilla and normal, got a good PhD in a hot subject, so I really fit in.

The truth is most if the time I just really wanted to do bad things to my partners. When single, multiples, I wanted to subdue them, make them make dirty things and carry around displaying them. When in a relationship I would go back to ""normal"", plain, simple. I would get frustrated at times, sometimes the kinky would leak

And then I met my current bf. A few weeks after we started hanging out I caught him masturbating while stuffing his face in dirty panties, I had found a partner in crime.

Outside all the twisted shit we do in bed and a bit of crassness on bf side (he is a bit crude

The scene when Adam pees on Hannah? I did that to my bf

In the end I just wish I could see more of him.

Hannah is interesting, but her inner monologue is great humor. I am beginning to think the point of the show is not to like her--she reminds me of a watered down version of Louie of Louis CK on FX

The other two characters are my favorites

And the other one (forgot her name with the british accent) is really cool because she doesnt hold anything back. She has convictions and while i dont endorse most of her actions

Adam revealed quite a few things this latest episode and I suspect there will be some potential for him to be cool. I really liked what he had to say to Hannah before the taxi showed up.
