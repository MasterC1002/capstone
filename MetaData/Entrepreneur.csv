We both have had a lot of experience with using Alibaba for getting products manufactured. See Our success with Alibaba [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/18ctrk/how_i_made_my_first_20_with_alibaba_and_a_cotton/). We are thinking about making a course (free for Reddit of course) on the topic. We now distribute our product to large retailers and no longer do the hand to hand online. 

Would you guys be interested? **Yes=Up Vote  No=Down Vote**

Also let me know why you would or would not want the course. Cheers

**[Edit] it would be a full course that walks you through the process form a-z. Brainstorm, prototypes, price negotiation, website build, to first sale**

[Update] A lot of you have said yes to this. I will be Setting up a site around this. I will create a list and update you as I progress with the course. I am in contact with the PR rep from Alibaba out of Hong Kong that interviewed me after my Alibaba Article got a bunch of attention. [Proof I am not B.s.ing](http://i.imgur.com/wZQ0I5N.png)

**This  was a fucking good validation! Didn't know so many people wanted to learn how to use Alibaba**

**[Update] Over 450 redditors signed up so far. Awesome. I am outlining the course now. And will update you all. All those that signed up will get access to course for free. This is going to be awesome.

I'll get right to it:

In October last year I was reading an article about a guy that started a cleaning company in his city and is now doing $150

I work full-time, if he can pull that off, why can't I? 

I got to working in this order:

1) I drew up a quick marketing plan-literally one page in bullet form  
2) Had a website built that featured some of the ideas that I thought was most appealing about his site.  
3) Asked my home cleaner if she would take the jobs if I got any and she basically said ""hells yeah""  (I now have a total of 8 cleaners)  
4) I brushed up on my adwords (I had already owned an Adwords guide and had dabbled in adwords before for another local company)  
5) Started Twitter and Facebook page.  

All of this took like 3 weeks.

I launched the site on November 3rd and had the first job on the first day.  

By the end of November I made my first $1,000 profit per week ($4,000 per month), which exceeds the take home pay from my full time job.

This post is two-fold.  To say

1) This is not brain surgery and 
2) Don't overthink shit

I'm just getting started with this and feel I could hit $10

ASK ME ANYTHING!

Also

If you guys want to tag along for the ride I plan to document everything here and you can follow along.  I'll make everything super transparent

**Tl/dr I started a cleaning company that replaced my take home salary from my full time job in 4 months.  Now I'm going to try again with a lawn care company and I'll make the entire process super transparent if you guys are interested.**

Edit: I figured I would share the site: http://www.maidsinblack.com/

**Final Edit: ** Thanks to all of you that asked such great questions.  I tried to answer as many of them as I could
Thanks to the kind Redditor who runs an awesome company with 200 employees that offered to meet me for lunch next weekend to give me some ideas and just to shoot the breeze.
Thanks to the kind UK redditor that gave me tips about the site by email.
Thanks to the nice Chinese redditor that pm'd me.

Everyone, no products to push, no nothing.  It would just be a chance to see me try to do this again real time in detail.  Hopefully it will help some folks to get going to try something.  Life is short!  Thanks :-)

* Patents

People (especially on r/entrepreneur) stress out about patents all the goddamn time. I sure did. No matter how great your idea is

The corporations interested in stealing products have pretty much the same criteria as the ones interested in legitimately buying products: they want to invest as little risk and effort as possible and likely won't begin to consider anything that isn't already on the market with retail packaging and a track record of sales.

The best part for them is that if they just wait you'll do all the hard work for them: you'll keep developing and improving your idea, developing packaging, finding manufacturers and distributors, and so on. The person acquiring your idea wants to be able to leave all of your manufacturing/distribution/etc systems in place -- ideally they'd just sign some papers and start taking your revenue with no further work required.

Once you've got all these pieces in place **then** you can worry about theft/think about selling your product

But even then, it won't do anything unless you have the strength to do something with it. Intellectual property cases are incredibly expensive and laborious, and the ""thief"" will likely have attorneys who specialize in ""patent trolling"", meaning you might cough up an awful lot of money to defend your idea only to have it ""legally"" stolen.

Clearly the patent system is a crappy one. It was intended to favor the little guy

(Un)fortunately patents are basically essential for the seal of approval they provide. Any corporation interested in buying or licensing your idea will likely require you to have one (because they can actually front the cash to defend a patent in court). Additionally

All-in-all

* Branding

However

If enough people come to see you as being someone who's honest, and committed to an idea, you'll be better-protected in many ways than if you had an iron-clad patent. This isn't idealism; it's solid, pragmatic, empirical advice. If a corporation steals your idea and you have a patent, then the best-case scenario is that you'll get a pile of damages fees in return for putting your business on hold for the several years you spend in court. If a corporation steals your idea and you have a strong emotional connection with your customers, then the best-case scenario is that your customers will do everything they can to build up your business and tear down the reputation of your competitor

* Customer service

For this reason, and then just respond when you're able. My e-mail signature is, ""P.S. If you've been waiting for a response from me for more than 24 hours, please don't hesitate to contact me again. You're important!""

**In general

* DIY-ish-ness

Running with the underdog idea, if it's some kind of electronic device, get bulk orders of all the components, put enough in a Ziploc bag to make one, type up some instructions and toss them in the bag, and sell it that way. You might be surprised by how many people really like ""some assembly required"" products, and this is a great way to emphasize your underdoggishness while facilitating the creation of a community around your product as its users share tips for building and modifying it. People probably won't steal your idea — I made a point of making DIY instructions for Noteboards as widely-available as possible and it seemed to have the opposite effect.

* So there.

Bear in mind that I'm a 24 year-old with no business experience aside from this, so by all means take this with a grain of salt. That said I experienced a great amount of success with Noteboards, which may be luck but might also not.

$25 - 50 pack of tri-color 24"" glow necklaces.
2x$12.99 - 40 pack of dual color bendable glow bracelets (80 total)
3x$10.60 - 6 pack of 14"" led color changing hair barrettes.

Spent another $6 on a pair of LED flashing nerd glasses for myself and $12 on pvc pipe and cap to hold the necklaces. 

Selling necklaces and bracelets got $3 or 2 for $5. If i sell all of them one at a time I would gross $390. Selling them all 2 at a time will gross $245. 

Led barrettes will be $6 or 2 for $10. Gross will be between $90 - $108. 

I'll update on my success tonight as well as after tomorrow night if I don't sell out tonight. I plan to adjust the pricing as needed but plan to stand firm tonight. If all goes well I plan on importing direct from the manufacturer for the next event and increasing my profit margin.

- **Sole Proprietor**:  The most basic of businesses.  Not incorporated

- **LLC**:  Limited Liability Company.  A newer type of entity that came into existence in the 1980s in the US based on the GmbH in Germany.  These offer the simplicity of a sole proprietorship or partnership when it comes to paperwork, which are outlined in the operating agreement.  LLCs can also elect to be taxed as S-corporations or C-corporations if they so choose.  Classified as ""self-employed"" typically for small businesses.  LLCs are often used by larger companies as liability shields as well.  See Walmart for example.  Walmart Inc. has a wholly owned subsidiary, ""Walmart Transportation"" which is their trucking and shipping of goods.  This shields the parent company without incurring additional tax issues.  Members are not required to be US citizens.  May be owned by a corporation.

- **S-Corporation**: A ""small business"" corporation.  Pre-dates the LLC, minutes, share issuance etc).  Must have a board of directors, even if one person acts as the entire board.  Requires even the owners be on payroll.  Shares are issued rather than membership.  These are beneficial for tax reasons often as small businesses can avoid higher FICA taxation by paying themselves a lower salary and taking the rest as a profit.  Can have up to 99 shareholders, and shareholders *must* be US citizens.  Corporate shareholders and partnerships are generally excluded. However, certain trusts, estates, notably 501(c)(3) corporations

- **C-Corporation**:  The big boys or people seeking VC/Angel investment typically.  The most paperwork requirements

- **LLP**:  Typically used by law firms, Limited Liability Partnerships shield partners from the negligence or civil issues of the other partners.  Similar to an LLC in a way, but the entire LLC would be held liable whereas a specific partner can be liable in an LLP.

- **PLLC**:  Professional LLC.  Specifically for doctors, and other professionally licensed firms.  This is like a normal LLC, but allows professional licensure to be granted to the LLC itself.  Many states will require a PLLC be used if a company is formed for these purposes.  There are also PLLPs in some states which basically combine LLP/PLLC.

--------------------------------

**What are the benefits to specific states?**

A lot of people love to puppet Delaware around because they know major corporations use it for a reason

- **Delaware**:  Good for C-corps.  Has the chancery court and no state-level income tax is leveed on companies.  There are high fees for compliance, or seek VC serves no purpose to form in Delaware and you are wasting your money.

- **Nevada**:  Relatively cheap.  Easy to file in, so take that as you will.

- **Wyoming**: Up and coming!  All the same as Nevada

- **Alaska**:  Are you a high credit business for whatever reason?  Alaska may be your best bet.  Alaska companies receive extra protection from creditors.  Companies may not be dissolved in state courts due to unpaid debts like they can in other states.  Companies that finance their receivables may find this useful if shit hits the fan.

- **Your Home State**: 9 times out of 10 for the small business

--------------------------------

**Should I go offshore?**

99% of the time I will say no.  There are plenty of benefits to offshoring however that don't involve dodging your taxes.  Here's an example:

- Bob owns a very successful business, her attempt to sue him for funds will most likely fail.  If set up properly, the judge can demand Bob get money out of his offshore accounts.  Bob can agree to try, but *his own trust* can deny him access for this reason if set up correctly, making it impossible for the now ex-wife to claim any of his assets.

Think about this. You are in college, or services?

Here are 7 things you can do now to start formulating those ideas:

1. Learn how to turn $0 into $10
For example, and create your own ad offering that service for a lower price. If you start getting customers, you can raise the price.

2. Survey the campus
Go to the student group meetups on campus. There are groups for EVERYTHING. For example
Survey these organizations and find a problem area within the organization. What do they need? What are they lacking? Photography? Website? T-shirts? Find it

3. Take risks
Do not be a wantrepreneur. You need to take some risks. Don’t spend 3 years pretending to be an entrepreneur. Start small, you will probably gain the confidence to start expanding off-campus, and making more connections and deals.
Stop writing business plans. Stop making business cards. Start focusing on the needs of the potential customers around you.

4. Grab a beer with your business professor
Well
Ask them to be your mentor

5. Use school resources
Become friendly with the marketing
Try to land a part-time gig in the publications office. You will have free access to all their equipment

6. Interview people
This doesn’t just apply to college students. Everyone can do this.
Think about it like this…You want to do something that you have never done before. What is the fastest way to learn and avoid mistakes? Ask the people that have done it before you. You are not the first person to have a business in college and you certainly won’t be the last.
The interviews can be in any medium – email, or written message (this works very well!). Make sure you listen more than you speak. The following are some questions you could ask:

* How did you start?
* What obstacles did you overcome?
* How did you use your network?
* What ideas did you consider but reject
* Who is your target market?
* What were some of the main tipping points (if any) or “A-ha!” moments? How did they come about?
* What is your most memorable moment
* What resources or tools did you find most helpful when you were getting started?
* What were your biggest mistakes
* Any key PR wins? Media, etc.? How did they happen?
* Do you outsource any parts of your business? If so
* If you were to do it all over again

Seven. Have fun
Don’t forget you are in college. Have fun and make money. Your college years are some of the best years of your life.

1372376263.0,1h7oti,My experience with blogging as a business and micro-enterprise -- 6 months in.,spacerocks_,173,20,134,"Hi everyone

My day job is helping to run a company that provides transcription services for Deaf people ([Link](http://intellitext-nv.com/)). The company is doing fine and the work is gratifying

None of this is conclusive, but this is my first experience with trying to make money from the internet alone. I am going to write a story about my experiences, create a rough roadmap of how to generate a little bit of income from blogging, and hopefully help or inspire some Redditors. 

**The challenge: How can I make money on the internet?** 

In trying to make some cash

* I considered trying to make instructional YouTube videos (how to tie a figure eight knot for climbing, this might have been a good choice. I may one day pursue this avenue. 

* I thought about making an ecommerce store. I researched this heavily but the barriers to entry were pretty high and competition is fierce. I was intimidated by trying to have to form relationships with Chinese wholesalers and distributors. For this to work, find a good dropshipper, and various other hurdles. This didn’t seem like a viable project for someone with my level of web design knowledge (read: none to speak of beyond basic HTML text formatting). 

* I applied to Scripted.com and passed their qualifying exams for Business and Sports writing. I have only ever received one offer from them

* I even considered doing EBay resale; buying things at yard sales and thrift stores and reselling them

So what could I do? Every post about making money on the internet says “generate high quality content first.” How does one do that when the internet is a big pile of voices all screaming over each other (“creating high quality content”)? I went to college for economics so my first thought was about value. How could I create value for other people?

**Leveraging my existing knowledge**

In my personal life, and high quality. My first reviews were pretty overwrought but I was still experimenting with tone, interest, level of depth, SEO, etc. It probably took me 3 hours to write a good review with pictures and appropriate links. Now I can write one in about 1.5 hours. It’s pretty time-consuming, but I enjoy reading about rock climbing products and I am fairly knowledgeable about them

I eventually registered the domain http://www.ruggedinnovations.com through Blogger.com. It cost $10 for the year, so the website hasn't really changed much since I first made it. 

**Revenue and monetization**

My traffic was very low at first; 1-4 page views per day. I applied for Google Adsense and was eventually accepted. I would look at Adsense dashboard every day and get depressed. I was probably making 5 cents a week off of this method. I also started trying to put affiliate links to the products I reviewed through Google Affiliates

I think I recently got an email that Google Affiliates is closing down -- I am not sure if that’s true, was pathetic. I never made a cent from Google Affiliate links.

At some point I switched to Amazon Associates, their browser downloads a cookie that attributes all sales within 24 hours to your account and gives you a percentage of the sales.  The percentage of the sales is 4% for the first 10 products your account sells, and then the percentage increases afterwards. This is the same business model that websites like This Is Why I’m Broke use except they do it on such a large scale that I wouldn’t be surprised if they make a few hundred dollars per day. I am just a small fish compared to them but they are a good proof of concept that the business model is successful and scalable.

The really powerful thing about Amazon Associates is that people often click the rock climbing product links then browse around and end up buying something else! I would say probably 50% of my sales proceeds come from rock climbing-related products. It’s not a lot of money; but it has repaid my $10.00 investment so far. Just today I sold a pair of prAna women’s pants. Here’s a screenshot of what a daily report looks like: http://i.imgur.com/J5utzDL.jpg. 

Here is a screenshot of my Q1 2013 revenue from Amazon Associates and the various products I sold: http://i.imgur.com/aZQi30S.jpg 

And here's a screenshot of the month of June's affiliate sales and some conversion data: http://i.imgur.com/b8jYkOp.jpg

**Getting traffic** 

I made Facebook, but eventually realized that since very few of my friends are into rock climbing relative to my total friends count, all I was doing by linking the reviews was spamming their feed. Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter have not really ended up being worthwhile sources of page views -- at least not the way I was doing it. I think most of Rugged Innovations’ Twitter and Pinterest followers are bots. I’ve noticed that lots of people on Twitter will follow you just long enough for you to follow them back then they will unfollow you. 

A great source of traffic has been Reddit. I started creating posts and replying to people in the /r/climbing subreddit and have gotten a lot of traffic from that. My strategy with that isn’t to spam links to my blog at every opportunity but rather to attempt to answer people’s questions and start discussions in earnest. Blogger.com allows you to see “Traffic sources” under stats, if someone posts about post-workout recovery techniques for rock climbing, I would respond to the question and then add that I’ve written a blog post that addresses that question in detail and then link to it.  The main problem is that the informational posts I make on Reddit very rarely have affiliate links on them, so they are not great sources of revenue. One of my most successful posts on Reddit has [only one affiliate link](http://www.ruggedinnovations.com/2013/02/recovery-for-rock-climbers-live-to.html). My limited understanding of SEO is that having more page views makes you more “relevant” to search engine spiders, so even though I am not getting revenue for these posts, the increased traffic makes my other content more likely to show up in searches. Here’s a screenshot of my web traffic: http://i.imgur.com/rFLKNnW.jpg 

Another big source of traffic is Google searches. A lot of people find my site from typing “[product name] review” into Google.  I make sure to include lots of competing products on my review pages -- this has the added advantage of letting me put more affiliate links on my page. There is a surprising amount of traffic from sources outside the US, I found ways to improve my rankings in searches. Now I show up in the top 5 results if you search for ""[product name] review"". 

Amazon Associates and Google Adsense both have rules against asking people to click your links deliberately or trying to trick people into click your links (for example, I would break the terms of service if I asked you to click an Amazon link on my page. I am not sure about grey areas here. For example, if a friend of mine asked me what my favorite videogame is, would it be breaking the terms of service for me to reply with an associate’s referral link to the game in question?  Feel free to chime in if you are familiar with this stuff. 

**What have I learned from all this?** 

First of all, so it did not really feel like work. However, if I had dedicated myself to something else in that time, I could have made a lot more money. That said, my old blog posts are still getting page views from Google searches and generating advertising and affiliate sales revenue. This means that as I write more articles I will generate revenue non-linearly.  I started making about 5-20 cents a month, and now I am making about $20 per month.  As of writing, I have received one Amazon Payments disbursement for $11.23. It’s not easy, or particularly lucrative. It has been fairly fun to write about something I love and generate a small amount of revenue from it. As I continue to write

**What’s the next step?**

I’ve started being contacted by outdoor PR companies and have started talking to them. Their business model involves forming relationships with equipment manufacturers who send them trial products. The PR companies then distribute these trials to reviewers and bloggers who talk about the products and try to generate grassroots sales. I’ll update this post if any of those relationships with PR companies work out. I am not sure if my having a relationship with a PR company creates a conflict of interest as far as my neutrality towards products

While we’re on the topic of full disclosure: by writing this post I will probably get a few hundred page views on my website and probably generate a small amount of advertising revenue; in any event

So there you have it

I am happy to answer any questions or provide specific instruction if there’s anything I can help you guys with!

It hurts to know things like this when you do nothing but treat them kindly. 


We never had a manager and to be honest we don't invest properly. We were paying three figures for a woman who was doing virtually nothing but laughing her ass off about how dumb we are.

How do you manage employees properly? Should we invest in a manager?

Should we inform them that we're monitoring them closely and even install a camera on the room to see what they do?

1356918539.0,15p8sh,Entrepreneur's list for 2013,,202,45,42,"This is just my personal collection from various websites. Made it all into one list

- Wake up early. Do something you love.- Eat a healthy breakfast. 

- Be positive and keep a positive attitude. Just try to stay focused on the positive and be optimistic about what the future has in store for you.

- Exercise. Get in shape. 

- Simplify. Minimize the material distractions of your life so you have more time to focus on what you really value.

- Turn off the TV. And the computer. And your cell phone. Disconnect from the imaginary world of pixels and binary. Disconnect and reconnect.

- Surround Yourself with Successful People. You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

- Don't procrastinate. You'll never know if there is a tomorrow. Get it done now!

- Expose yourself daily to visual pictures of your goals. Every night before you sleep

- Achieve your goals by keeping your mouth shut. Psychology tests have proven that when you tell someone your goal

- Smile to improve your mood. Try this the next time you are in a bad mood: Instead of frowning, you are likely to experience a more positive mood.

- Be Worldly. The successful man makes the effort to know what's happening in the world around him. He has informed opinions about current events and can engage intelligent people in friendly discussions.

- Know About Life's Finer Things. Your knowledge of the finer things shows class and culture. It shows that you can be a peer among statesmen and business leaders. I recommend that you familiarize yourself with food, art, and literature.

- Have good manners. People do notice these little things and will give you the props you deserve.

- Make public speeches. A good speaker is rare

- Keep a network of contacts. The more people you know

- Travel. This is about broadening your horizons by going someplace different. When you travel

- Dress well. Here are the basics: Dress sharply in contemporary styles. Groom yourself well and have a clean shave. Smell nice

- Reality spin. When habitually put a negative emotional spin on objective facts, you'll be freer to see opportunities and possibilities that others might miss.

- Get your priorities right. Its all about making intelligent choices

- Use your resources wisely. While shopping

- Examine life

- Worry only about the things that are in your control. The things that can be influenced and changed by your actions

- Be a responsible human being. Approach yourself with honesty and thoroughness; maintain a kind of spiritual hygiene; stop the blame-shifting for your errors and shortcomings.

- Go for it. There will never be a better time in your life to live your dream of entrepreneurship.  Swing for the fences with a goal to add your name to the prestigious list above. If you fail

- Dream big, so why allow anyone to ever stop you from anything you believe you can do? Your dreams are only as good as the actions you are going to take to make them a reality. Remember to dream big no matter what others have to say or believe, and ensure you work each and every day to live the life you want, not the one you have to.

**Prequel**

I was in between student jobs in April this year, learn how to build iOS applications. I'm not going go to into to much technical depth here, but when starting, I knew some PHP (and of course the usual HMTL/CSS stuff), and had a general idea of how programming worked - but no idea about Objective-C whatsoever. And it looked extremely hard. I was always fascinated with apps and decided that if other people can build them, why shouldn't I. Also, I had already paid some money for others to built an app for me, I already had an idea what (real) problem my app should solve: Making Instagram fashion-content shoppable easily. I always find it way easier to work on a project when learning something

**Coding the app**

I first started my journey by watching some free tutorials on YouTube, or outdated versions of XCode. So that did not help. At all. I had heard about Treehouse before and checked out some of their free stuff, so I decided to sign up for a paid account, which turned out to be a great decision. Luckily for me, they have a tutorial which teaches you to build a blog reader, an (very very simple) app which pretty much has the same core functionality than what I tried to build. I don't want to turn this into an advertorial for them, but I found their videos to be extremely helpful and well structured. 

So there I was, reading solutions on StackOverflow, or stopping myself from punching my screen after my build crashed in the simulator once again (it always happened for no reason obviously). After about 15 days, I had built what I considered my MVP. From a technical standpoint, it included the Instagram API, my own - simply structured - MySQL database + JSON-representation of it, a PHP backend for adding content manually, I did all the coding and designing work myself. I knew some features were missing

[Here are some early screenshots of the app](http://imgur.com/a/jaGpQ#0). Not sure if this is version 1.0 or 1.1

**First days in the app store**

I had previously launched an app in the app store (the one I paid someone else to build it), and only received a couple of downloads, maybe about 30-50 a month. I just checked iTunes Connect - fashion.gram got 881 downloads in its first month. 881. With no marketing efforts whatsoever. I had a couple of reporting metrics built in, and they were showing real numbers. People were clicking on products. People were actually using what I had built. Sure, it wasn't the greatest app ever, but it did what it was designed to. I was super excited. On top of that, a week after, anytime I see something on IG that I want, but then again

In the next couple of weeks, double-tap to shop (I don't think anyone uses this, but since Instagram is ""double tap to like"", I wanted to make my app ""double tap to shop"" - it's actually my favourite feature), added some more metrics (stream-views, CTR to shops), and optimized some things here and there. I was still looking not to add to much stuff


**Marketing &amp; PR**

Up to this point, Mail), but I rarely see one of my pre-set tweets on Twitter. I actually got lucky and found an Android developer through a friend of a friend who is currently coding a version for Android phones and tablets (simply because he liked me, and he liked the product). After he finishes his work - which should be some time next week - I will start spending money on advertisement, and I think I have figured out a channel where this is money spent well. Sorry reader, I will keep this secret for now.

In terms of PR. Well. I got a great review from thehighlow.com, and then contacted them with my product/story. While I still think this is somewhat of a clever hack, the reality of limited media coverage tells me it isn't. But maybe this will work for you. I will try this again in the near future though. 

**TechCrunch Frontpage**

Speaking of hacks, since I'm really not the type of guy who needs ego boosts like that. So a couple of nights ago, I was about to go to sleep and decided to send out a tweet to Alexia Tsotsis. I knew she was the one writing articles on Instagram and apps for TC, and I kind of remembered she used to be a fashion blogger. So before turning off the lights (and my phone), I typed a tweet that goes ""@alexia as an ex fashion blogger, you should check out our app."", but clearly decided it needs to be a (tad) bit more edgy. Here's what I ended up tweeting: ""@alexia you might be a tad bit older than our regular users, you should check out our app."". Edgy yes, after @alexia responded to my tweet saying "".@fashiongram Worst pitch ever"". FYI, ""who tweets for fashiongram? #clueless"". I was amused

I had gotten the attention I was looking for, I saw that @alexia had written an article named [Startups, I Give Up On You For Today""](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/17/startups-i-give-up-on-you-for-today/) on TechCrunch. I clicked it on my phone - boom - a screenshot of my tweet made the TC frontpage. Please tell me again how I'm doing PR wrong, pretty girl on Twitter. As a sidenote, the article is in fact pretty horrible and should have never been published.

Of course (unfortunately) the article did not link to my app at all, how people would consider it bad press. I had my personal triumph. I set out to having my logo on the TechCrunch front-page, and achieved that within a couple of days. I set a goal and achieved it. This is the way I am looking at it. ""Bad press"" - funny. As if someone is going to remember about this the next day, or even 10 minutes later. Maybe putting it into the headline baited you into reading this article, maybe I can use the story somewhere else. Who knows? Additionally, a start-up from the valley contacted me and wants to work with me after seeing my app, I might fly out to SF to meet with them in September. #socialmediawin!

In terms of numbers, since the download numbers for the actual app were not affected. I got like 5 more that day, yay me! So that's that.

**Status Quo**

I'm going to talk some numbers now. Since we started (as in ""since the tracking was added""), this is a mindblowing number. It means, we have referred more than 2500 potential customers to online stores. Until now, we have not used any affiliate links, so besides not having made a dime in revenue, we also don't know about the conversion rate, or how many leads/signups we generated for those shops. We are going to change this soon. Until yesterday morning,800 downloads, I shall call this whole thing a ""Start-Up"" now - and the Android version is expected to be ready soon. It should have been ready a week ago

**Learnings (no particular order and somewhat unrelated)**

1. It's super hard to actually get your app onto your phone to test it. Provisioning profiles and code-signing are terrible things.
2. Go do. Seriously. I see a lot of posts in this sub-reddit saying ""I got this idea""
3. App Store marketing: Use plain screenshots of your app
4. Everybody will tell you this: Get something out quickly and reiterate after.

**Is a long post (you may want to save it for later). You can TLDR at the end.** 


**Disclosure:** I have no affiliation with any of the tools I mention. I use them and I like them. Thats it. Read on:

This first post deals with **how to reach your market**.

If you're interested in a post about how to obtain basic market numbers (**S**ize of **T**otal **M**arket

First: IMHO **the questions you want to answer are about 3 main subjects:**

- Your target market

- Your competitors

- The ""influencers"" of that market

And the questions are the same for all of them:

- Who

- What

- Where

(You can add How and When

**The best place to start are your competitors.** Why? *Because they already did the grunt work for you.*  

They are reaching the target market and they are already been discussed (knowingly or not) by the influencers of that market. 

**So

- **Who: Exactly who your biggest competitor are, features (free shipping? one day delivery? your own designs? etc.)

- **What exactly are they doing to get that traffic:** Paid advertising? SEO? Social Media? Content Marketing? Is not the same for every industry. Ideally you want to do everything

&gt;The most important lesson we learned early on was to be very focused on the tactics that we decided to execute. In other words

- **Exactly Where are they doing that:**

       **Paid Advertising:** Text ads in google search results? Banners? where? which Adnetworks? Are they paying affiliates? How much? In which affiliate networks? Paid post? where? You get the idea. 

      
  **SEO:** Where the backlinks are coming from? Which keywords bring the traffic?

 **Social Media:** Which Social Network works better for them? Facebook? Twitter? Youtube? Pinterest? Niche forums? 
      
      
 **Content Marketing**: They have a blog? Are they guest blogging? Where? Are they doing videos?  

So

Sign up here for my email list... Come on! You can't take a joke  eh? **Here is how:**

**Who your main competitors are:** 

Search in google for your main keywords. In this example we can search for ""Funny T Shirts""

If you do 3 searches

Put in a spreadsheet every url. Paid and Organic. (Tip: Do not click the ads

If you see a lot of paid ads is a good signal

Eliminate the duplicates. 

**Now order them by traffic volume.** I used to manually go to Quantcast

[Follow.net](http://follow.net/) Not only gives you the traffic data

You use that

If you installed this app

**The good thing is that here you start to answer questions about your market too: because you start to see nice demographic data for every site (age

Put the data on the spreadsheet and order them by traffic volume. 

Now you can work with your main ones (depends on the market

**Now, [SpyFu](http://www.spyfu.com/), [MixRank](http://mixrank.com/), [OpenSiteExplorer](http://www.opensiteexplorer.org), and search in every affiliate network manually. You can use Follow or those (I think you have free trials on all of them).  
 
This will give you data on Paid Advertising (Search, and SEO. 

**You still need data on social media.** This is easy. Every site in you list have buttons that show in which Social Networks they are present. Visit them and note down how many fans

While you're looking at the facebook page of one competitor click in the tab displaying the number of fans. **More demographic data!** This will give you age groups and geographical influence. 

You want to study what are they publishing, Videos, etc.) use [FanPageKarma.com](http://www.fanpagekarma.com).


**And last

Search in google for ""mycompetitorname"" and ""mycompetitorname.com"" and you get a nice list of media oulets

The assumption is that if somebody mentions them is because they think that kind of content is valuable for their readership. **So they have an inclination to mention you too.** 


**TLDR;** 

**Google your main keywords and list every url in the results, Affiliates, Social Media, etc.), use [Fanpagekarma](http://www.fanpagekarma.com/) for more social media info, and do searchs for your competitors name to see wich blogs/media outlets mention them.** 

I hope this was useful. It took longer that I thought. I left out some things because I wanted to keep it short (and failed miserably). English is not my first language so apologies for any mistake.

Hello /r/Entrepreneur

I've really enjoyed this community since finding it a couple months ago.  I just completed the sale of my business last week

Since leaving school 6 years ago, to wholesaling and distributing various products.

At times I've marketed through knocking on doors, SEO, PPC, Affiliate programs, and mail.

I've gone into boardrooms face to face with executives at Fortune 500 companies.  I've also started online companies

I've created brands, and negotiated partnerships with major companies.

I've had 80 hour work weeks

I've had some successes such as growing a company from zero to $1 million in sales within 11 months.  I've grown 3 other companies into the 6 figure sales range.  I've sold two companies.  

I've also failed numerous times.  In the beginning, and almost quit (ie got a job) on a couple occasions.

Due to some NDA's and general respect for those that are now running my companies

We’ve finalized the product, we’ve launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the mold need for mass production. I’m not asking you to pledge/donate, I just want to show you what is achievable with a year of work with the backing of this subreddit:

**Validate Your Skill Level**

Are you currently a web programmer? If no, etc. Not saying you can't learn it, just saying it takes a lot of work and time that most entrepreneurs don't have to use and in some cases waste.

Focus on content instead of all the code. You will get a better product in the end.

You can learn how to do html and css within a few months but using a CMS system is much cleaner and easier and if you need something dynamic

You generally need to know at least php and mysql for dynamic websites unless you want to get into the confusing worlds of joomla and drupal. I hear decent things about Ruby on Rails though on par with php and mysql learning curve I think.

**Want to Learn Web Programming Anyway?**

Try [CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com) for interactive programming learning.

**No Coding Skills Start Here**

Get / Use the following:

* **Hosting:** [Bluehost.com](https://www.bluehost.com/)
* **Domain name:** Buy through Bluehost and get a privacy option on it
* **Web Platform to one click install:** WordPress a CMS platform
* **Find an appropriate responsive wordpress theme here:** [Themeforest.net](http://themeforest.net/)
* **Install and configure these free plugins in order:** [Better WP Security](http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/), [Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), [Broken Link Checker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/), [Growmap Anti Spambot Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/growmap-anti-spambot-plugin/), [Date/Time Now Button](http://wordpress.org/plugins/datetime-now-button/), and [Advanced Responsive Video Embedder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/)
* **Buy other plugins you need here:** [CodeCanyon.net](http://codecanyon.net/)
* **Need an affiliate manager?:** Use [Linksert.net](https://www.linksert.net/) and it's free [WordPress plugin](https://www.linksert.net/plugin).

**Need Something More Dynamic?**

You have a few options. This list goes from least expensive to most expensive. Just know that most things you want to do already have a plugin or theme designed for them for WordPress. There are however a lot of exceptions to that guideline and that is why you look at the following options.

* Least Expensive end
* Hire someone to develop a WordPress plugin to do that dynamic stuff (cheaper than second option)
* Hire someone to build you a custom WordPress theme that has the functionality you need. 
* Hire someone to develop the site from the ground up. 
* Most expensive end

The reason why WordPress is mentioned a lot is because it is a CMS aka Content Management System which allows you to manage a ton of the pages and posts and various other aspects of the website. If a developer really needs to

Some developers can be found here: [Elance](https://www.elance.com/) (freelancers)

**Things to remember with website development**

* Try to use a responsive website themes and plugins so that it can fit any screen size including tablets and phones.
* Get familiar with what they call ""sticky footer"" so that your footers don't end up halfway up the screen on low content pages. [Example and info.](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html)
* Get familiar with the concept of having a fixed header as it will promote a lot of use of your website. [Example and info.](http://lifeinthegrid.com/simple-css-fixed-header/)
* Design is important. You have ~2.6 seconds to capture their attention before they bounce. Read this book to learn about it: ""[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)""

1359983427.0,17v514,What many of you have wrong about outsourcing,itchyouch,145,41,54,"Off and on

**To be as clear as possible:**

**Outsourcing is currency arbitrage &amp; currency arbitrage only.**

This has many ramifications for what out sourcing is NOT and what is does NOT accomplish.

* **Outsourcing does not decrease the amount of work that needs to be done.**  A worker in India, then with similar tools, it should also take 10 hours in Chile.  
   * If the market rate for designers of roughly equal quality is $120/hr in the US and $20/hour elsewhere, either the equivalent amount of work has not been done (quality suffers), or you're getting work with shortcuts that were made that may or may not be acceptable to you (forgery, copy/paste).
* **Design competitions are not outsourcing.**  Competitions are competitions.  Design competitions abroad with USD as the prize is just putting out a sufficiently large enough carrot to attract participants.  If Martians outsourced work to the earth and put out a $5k prize for a winning design for their needs

* **Outsourcing does not replace proper &amp; good process.**  This is perhaps the most important for any build project.  Things like work quotes, sign offs, project management don't go away with outsourcing.  The way you work with someone abroad is EXACTLY the same as how you should be working with someone local.  The only difference is that you're using different methods of collaboration (in-person vs remote) to follow those practices.

* **All quality work HAS value.** As the saying goes

* **Outsourcing is not cheap labor.**  A similar point to the prior point.  Paradoxically

* **Outsourcing does not necessarily come with the same value added customer services as local firms.**  This is a similar point to following good process.  Things like being in the same time zone, cultural similarity &amp; tastes, cultural compatibility,  proper/accepted U.S. English grammar and many others are value add-ons that we almost never think about.  Currency arbitrage is purely currency arbitrage and the pros/cons of the value-added services need to be weighed.  This is the wisdom behind having a good project manager, to let someone else alleviate the communication overhead and be a task master to achieve the desired results.

* **Outsourcing only for currency arbitration is a short-sighted recipe for failure** The reality is that most people are looking for lower-cost employees that work remotely or they are looking for a freelance/consulting firm to provide deliverables at a lower cost.  It always makes sense to also consider outsourcing projects locally, etc.  This is also redundant advice on following good process.

So in summary, India's best programmers now command pretty close to U.S counterparts anyway)  As far as outsourcing goes, Google recognizes the value-adds that are given up to take advantage of the arbitrage.  I remember reading about how they outsource to India for programmers, but since Goog realizes that programming is an art, they built out their own facilities to train programmers to be the best at a lower price point.

Anyway

***EDIT***
Some have pointed out some discrepancies of which I whole heartedly agree with.

So, lots of graphic designers hated it (which it's basically in their best interest to do having worked with it).

What I didn't find was anyone who said that using it was a mistake.  Hopefully the next person who looks will find this to give them more context.

My budget for a design was about $300 each.  Not too cheap (IMO)

""Okay, they just aren't working for me"".  

DesignCrowd and 99 designs both suggested guaranteeing my prize

So I increased my award amount to $400 and added three participation awards of $20 each in DesignCrowd and did something similar for 99 designs.  Add that to the fees and we're at around $800 for both.  

We all know that I could have hired a decent graphic designer for this amount of money;  I could have posted it here on reddit and had some designs by the end of the day.  But I was a victim of sunk cost and I didn't want to give up on the hours I spent giving feedback and eliminating designs.  

Now

As I finish the process
-More choice don't equate to better choices
-Good designers generally only work for good money
-99designs and designcrowd require very active participation
-You will almost certainly spend more than you expect

TL;DR
I wasted a ton of time and probably didn't save any money.  I got some decent designs but may have done better with a talented freelancer from Craigslist or Reddit.  When my budget was low

**TL:DR I got the idea to import hair extensions from Asia via this subreddit in August

**BACK STORY**
Back in August 2011 when I was still unemployed and down to my last $300 I see a post on here asking about importing products someone post an article about an Australian Kid who imported MP3 players from China and over time made $100

I stayed up all night thinking what could I import and sell. I came to the idea of importing hair extensions which in my city has hundreds of retails stores near salons but the retail stores never work B2B with the salons. I ordered a sample and received my first order paid in advance and made a nice $30 profit.

**CURRENTLY**

* I work 8 to 5
* Ordering about $2000 at a time.
* I am working directly with 3 salons.
* Turning over my inventory about every 2 weeks.
* I secured a line of credit with my banks for $600 I pay off the card in full about twice a month.
* Moved all my personal money
* Still live at home with parents so no Life overhead to eat at profits.
* Outside a few hundred from my initial orders all the money being used is the profits.
* I got charged my first customs bill because my last order $3200 had to come in a box the looked like it went through middle earth to get here.

On a typical sale I am making $40 - $95 profit, and Saturday when clients get their hair styled for the weekend. I am paid as soon as they sell product I get the call to pick up my money. This works now but I would like to grow this hustle into a business.

My #1 HIGH VOLUME customer wants me only to sell to her salon

**Operating Equipment**

*  My Android cell phone with a Google Voice # I only give to clients and put on my business card.
*  My 2009 MacBook Pro
*  My 1993 Camry

**Closing**
I am nothing more than a middle man and I humble in the fact that if any of my salons decided to actually do their own research they could import on their own. I am not allowing myself to get *comfortable* with my new stream of entrepreneurial income. Hopefully I can grind this into a business or make enough to start a new business.

1349897541.0,119ned,Why do so many employers shit on employees?,yourjoboffersucks,97,13,102,"I've been a consultant for a little over a year.  

When I left my last job

I applied for a management position.  That job went to my boss’s friend.  A week later I told my manager that I was resigning; but that I'd stay for $100

Since that time I've billed them, the year is not over.  They have hired two people to replace me, both making mid-70’s.  Neither of the two people can do the actual job that I did, and so we are working on another contract for me to do more work. 
  
I’ve consulted for about 15 other clients and my finding is this:  Companies don’t want to hire and pay people.  The good people they do have tend to get burned out after a year or two because they’re overworking.  They get dumped on.  

There is an attitude at the top about the employees they have.   Employees are essentially disposable and not valued assets.  The top also believes their success is a direct credit to how deserving and wonderful they are.   Of course they are wrong.  In fact

But what amazes me is how they are willing to pay me $250/hour to do a job as a consultant instead of hiring me as a fulltime employee for $50/hour.  It’s the same job.  It’s a job that never ends.  It’s a job where they’ll still need more of me.  They could get me or someone like me for 1/5 the price.  

Why?

I think it’s because they are lazy and have no fucking clue.  They just make the shit up as they go.  

Several times I’ve said

Then I discovered an internet marketing thread on a bodybuilding forum I frequented. I dove in. Tried it all. First I was going to design free websites for journalism students and get paid by bluehost commissions. Then I was going to start a SEO business. Then I was going to rank up for dentist and doctor keywords and sell ad space.

Can you see where I went wrong? I was focusing on the MONEY and not on the VALUE generation.

The idea that finally worked for me was when I sat down and thought ""what is unique about myself that is rare and valuable?"" And the answer: I'm a 200lb Asian bodybuilder who was a World of Warcraft addict for 5 years. There's a real need for health

It's now been over a year. I have 11, and improving every day. But I am convinced that it was my change in philosophy of ""how do I make money"" to ""how can I best provide value to people"" that then lead to my content being successful.

I released a paid member's section on June 13th and released T-Shirts two days ago. Between those two products I've managed to make over $1

And really my take-away from this whole last year is to just keep going. Focus on making small incremental improvements every day. Don't expect perfection and you won't be disappointed. Failures are nothing but signs that you need to make course corrections. I had high hopes of capping out my paid member's section in a week. Well that hasn't happened at all. So I see I have two choices - give up

So don't look at your venture as something that will make or break you. Look at your venture for all of the skills you're gaining - becoming a better writer, thinker.

You must have a way to monetize or you are esentially running a charity.

If you are a blogger you probably have in mind some ways you want to make money or you have ways you are making money. If you don't have the plan

Figure out how to charge people.

Here is more detail about it:

The course covers how to develop an iOS app through outsourcing. It's geared towards beginners who have no idea where to begin when it comes to developing an app and hiring someone overseas to do it. I was once there and have learned a lot in two years. I've developed four apps and have hired teams all overseas. The course will take beginners from how to get an idea, and all the steps when it comes to hiring a team to work on it. It also covers what you'll need to prepare to upload it to the App store. Will admit it's light on the marketing cause it's not my strong point. But it covers everything before. 

I've developed four apps like I said and never had any one run off with my money

Hope it can help you get that idea you've had in your mind become a reality

So how come I'll (very) often see someone visiting r/entrepreneur asking for advice on how to get their idea off the ground only to be bombarded by comments like ""that will never work"" or "" it seems like you know nothing about your idea

1363796154.0,1ao4du,I made an iPhone app that's I'm somewhat proud of.  It's called Fridge Pal and is a shopping list / home inventory / recipe tool.  Looking for advice on how to promote it and build a larger customer base.  Sales data and history inside for those making apps and who are interested.,nazbot,108,33,84,"Hey all

Posted this on /r/cooking and someone messaged me to say I should post the app here.

Basically I made an iPhone app in my spare time.  The impetus for making the app was that I had some code to scan barcodes and wanted to find an interesting use for it.  I often had the problem that I'd put food in my fridge and sometimes forget to use it before it went bad or just forget how old it was (sauces and long term items like that).

I figured I could make an app that would let you scan barcodes when you put stuff in the fridge and then have it remind you to use items when they might be going bad.

When I got that working I realized it would be great to also add in a shopping list component.  As well

In addition

I went with a paid upgrade approach to monetization - I made the app free to download and then put in an in app purchase of $2.99 to unlock features.

I average bout 70-100 downloads a day and from that get around 3-4 paid upgrades.  In total I've made about $3000 from about 6 month's of sales.  I split the profits with the designer (another redditor).  I didn't do any advertising or send the app in to review sites to promote it.  It was not really at the point where I could feel comfortable with it until very recently.  I think I have a conversion rate of about 5% which seems decent from what I've heard.

I upgraded the app yesterday and got about 3

It sits about 800 in the US productivity app store and just recently I changed it to Food and Drink where it debuted at around 300 in the US app store.

One comment on this approach that other app developers may find interesting - I'm not sure if doing the in app purchase  is the best way to drive sales.  Free apps need a LO of downloads in order to rise in the ranks and if you're making an app that's limited I'm not sure it provides enough value to become a hit.  If I had made a purely paid option (with the lite version opening the link to the paid version) I wonder if I would have had much better visibility in the app store itself.

I'm asking you guys if you could review the app and let me know whether there's anything in it that you think is poorly made.  Likewise

Star Ratings and reviews all seem pretty good - mostly 4 and 5 star reviews with people saying that it's well designed and easy to use.  No major bugs or crashes.

Just as some feature bullet points which separate this from other shopping list apps:

- Dropbox support so the app can add text files of your shopping list / home inventory / recipe lists
- Syncing and push notifications when you have multiple devices or people in your home using the app
- Notifications to remind you to use food when it goes bad without needing to open the app
- Shopping Lists are GPS aware so when you leave a store without buying everything it will remind you
- Some fairly nice art and design compared to other shopping list apps

As well, and would love feedback in that regard.

The website (WIP) is www.fridgepalapp.com and you can grab the app on itunes at: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fridge-pal-shopping-list-expiry/id496451091?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4.

The shipping for each was 23$.

I was excited and I was really motivated to sell on different site like Ebay in my country. So I took nice picture and I did put the product on theses different site.

I calculated and my profit margin was 40%. But my mistake was to really not test the product extensively. Because when I did

1370973695.0,1g4wml,Who's up for a little Entrepreneurial competition?,noneo,93,20,202,"Would anyone be game to play a little... game...

**Apparently yes!!**

**Now that we have an awesome amount of people to form teams lets hear some ideas! Please post any ideas you want a team to tackle and post them as a top level comment to this thread or in the new startup subreddit /r/startupcompetition**

**Keep it going strong!!**

**Also


The idea is this: 

1. We form X teams (maybe 2 to start out), sales, etc. Both teams would have similar total skills to make things more interesting.

1. Start a new post asking the community for any and all ideas for an entrepreneurial startup. These ideas would be limited to low-cost startups. i.e. dropshipping via online store, whatever as long as it does not need any angels/venture capitals.

1. The top X ideas (respective of the # of teams) are then each given to a team and the clock starts!

1. The first team to earn $1

This is all for fun, those that are on the edge about starting something themselves and hesitant to take the first step. It can show that success can be made with little capital, and the entrepreneurial game is loads of fun!

Here are some quick Points:

Dozens of cities with 10's of thousands of full time out of state employees living in man camps making 6 figures per year.

All cities are usually 30 to 60 minute drive from each-other.

Most current restaurants/fast food chains have lines that go around the block.

Employees are almost impossible to come by.

Logistics related to supplies is tough


Land is tough to get (and very very expensive) but there are buildings for rent and lease usually (but also expensive).




My question is

I would really like to walk in with a ""new food thing""... not another McDonalds

*Edit- I completely mixed up my vocab when I wrote this. I am not going for craft beer

I just quit my factory job to start my first business. I decided that the best time to follow my dreams is now. I'm 19 living with my parents for a couple more months before I move out. I am going to be applying for college in the fall of 2013. The thing is, because I want to learn, to do, and to create, to follow my passions. I don't know if my ideas are good, and I know they are going to be horribly executed because I just don't know enough yet. But I have to start. So I’m diving in, for better or for worse. 

So about my startup, when I starting thinking about this I googled craft beer labels and found a bunch of sites that allowed people to design labels themselves. I think there is a bit of a hole in the market though. I want to offer people premium labels. Something classy, these labels would not be something that you would buy for every batch you brew, these are for special occasions. Your buddy’s birthday, a wedding gift, or just to show off to your friends when you brew that perfect batch. 
 
The site is called stagglabels.com. 

So Reddit, help a fellow redditor out. And follow me on /r/stagglabels . This is going to be awesome.

P.s. feel free to ask me questions in the comments and give any advice you want. Thank you so much for reading this!

*Edit- I wanted to talk more about what I want the site to look like. I am inspired by sites like jackthreads.com and fab.com. I like the layout of these sites. I like how they cycle products and have sales. They give you a sense of urgency because you know that everything is limited time offers. Eventually I could see the site moving to a what I call a ""collection"" format. Instead of having 15 to 20 labels on the homepage to buy I would have maybe ten cycling ""collections"" with 15 to 20 labels each.

Then, stopped eating carbs. I've lost 30 pounds in a few months. 

And I started working on my company again. It was all-in. I've had a ""business partner"" who scammed me in the past. I've severed the ties but he reappeared and maybe he gave me the motivation to fight. To show that I am better.

I've had no income yet I hired my brother full-time (burning on my money)

After a few months my income started reappearing, then $10k per month and then it peaked at $30k per month. I was MANIC. It was really a great turnaround.

Then

The scammer, hiring people(while he still works part-time in a SEO agency) and doing better he acted like he is better and I am not able to do anything. He reads into this whole NLP/PUA bullshit and is pretty delusional but this meeting affected me somehow. He copied my business model inch-by-inch, tried to steal my customers and yet acted like he was better. After it, I felt helpless. Like if all my achievements were for nothing.

Background:I have commented about this story a lot, I could have moved from making 10k a summer to at least 20k pretty easily.  Do this year round with multiple teachers in the summer, I could have made 100k a year with the knowledge of a teenager.  After 3 years I had hired 3 extra teachers, filled a 30hr a week schedule and increased my prices 100%.  I made this in response to the post about how long you entrepreneurs work so it might focus on helping you relax a bit.  Also, if you are looking to expand by hiring professionals you may have to tweak this advice so it applies to your scenario.  This is a bit of what I learned.

* Minimize financial overhead.  I spent maybe $20 a year on a clock, but not if you put your mind to it.
* If you need help, or writing.  Talk to AP(advanced placement) teachers at your local high school if possible.
* Pay them well and include them in your operations.  Kids have great ideas before they get to college and are told they will not work.  They will be eager to help and will cost nothing compared to an experienced professional
* If you need a college degree to do the job, they will work hard for you.  If you have no idea, find a cheap professional
* If it is repetitive, first serve, somebody showing up at the wrong time was never my fault after the first couple years.
* Make everything as flexible as possible for the customers.  I could have clients pay for every lesson up front
* I cannot stress this enough
* Word of mouth will be your best advertiser and it is free.  A family from Korea contacted me 2 weeks before moving to America because of word of mouth.
* Treat your customers like your parents.  Free repairs, whatever make them remember you and come back for more.  If it doesn't cost you too much and it isn't your main product/service, it should be free.
* If you have public space
* You might have a product
* Do something unique and helpful and do not expect anything in return.  Articles in the newspaper got me business willing to drive 30 minutes for lessons

**TL:DR** Don't spend a lot on one thing. Hire very young, be genuinely happy about what you do.  If possible, donate your service on weekends to those in need.

Also, yes, I did spend my money very quickly on what many of you may consider stupid things.  However, spreading the wealth to my less fortunate friends so they could partake in the adventures of childhood with me continues to bring me a lot of pleasure.  I now understand that this is a subreddit for adult entrepreneurs that does not seem to welcome the money making opportunities utilized by young entrepreneurs.

12

All along, super paranoid about the legality of everything -- especially now that I've started to try to do international shipping and that tax season is coming up. My business experience is pretty much zero, so I've been learning all this stuff on the fly.

It's fun on the one hand

* I'm forgetting to file (or am incorrectly filing) some tax form

* I'm using the US Postal Service to mail things internationally since it's the least expensive service

*That said*

But when you're living by the seat of your pants and spend all day thinking about your business and sole source of income, but is still worrisome).

So here are my big questions:

* How can I be positive of what taxes I need to file? As a tiny-ass single-person wholesale/retail business I'm a ""disregarded entity""
  * **Annually:**
  * 1040 (Fed Tax Return)
  * 1040
  * 1040
  * 940 (Federal Unemployment Tax Return)
  * **Less-than-annually:**
  * 1040-ES (Estimated Income Tax)
  * 941 (Social Security &amp; Medicare Deposits)

* Are there any inexpensive alternatives to the USPS for international shipping? I *love* the Postal Service

* I'm having a lot of fun doing this in spite of my complaining, and customer base so they can help Noteboards reach their potential better than I ever could. Who should I contact and how?

Thanks!

So that leads me to what my idea was. Would /r/entrepreneur be interested in a regular webcast/google+ group hang/conference call where one person presented a topic and their insight and then had a Q&amp;A session. 

I just like the idea of keeping it fairly informal

So what does everyone think

**Edit 1** Okay, their business.

So with that all in mind

1. The discussion will be a panel type presentation. I think three people would be perfect to be the panel. The reason for this is fairly simple. I want there to be enough content to get people to be involved, there will be multiple sources for the answer, alternative view points and possibly multiple insights. 

2. The presentation will be scheduled out. I'm not sure how frequently to do this. If I manage it

3. I like the idea of video chat. I want there to be face to face discussion. The way people talk about things when they aren't casually typing it out in a chat room is so much more natural. Sorry

4. The format I see is this. I think we can give control to the panel members and the moderator for who has video. I would hope there is a chat function also, or via video. They have the opportunity for a follow up question, but it must be related to the first question directly. In other words, one topic at a time so you can't hog the discussion. Then we will offer breakout sessions with the presenters after say 30 minutes of Q&amp;A. Those can be conducted however, even in IRC (IRC for the WIN). 

5. As a side, SEO bonuses are always nice. Maybe we can also supliment it with a company bio as well. That way they can get the word out. 

That's my thoughts so far. I'll flesh it out more as I work on it. ",self,t5_2qldo,1348166385.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/106lcf/i_had_an_idea_for_improving_the_rentrepreneur/

___________________________

I have been well and truly addicted to the internet for years. My willpower to resist it is a sad joke. I waste way too much time online as it is, with reddit as the very worst bottomless pit offender. 

I knew I could edit the hosts file to block a site, because let's not get crazy here, we need breaks, but would cut it off for the rest of the day after a set threshold was reached. Found it!

Not new, say whether you want to block them during certain time periods or after a certain threshold is reached in a period you select (hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, week, etc.) or both, pick the days of the week you want the rule applied, of course). 

If you go to visit a culprit site while it's on lockdown, as I'm typing, my four open reddit tabs all reload to show the above image and I can't reddit anymore until this time tomorrow. It really was just what I needed. I had chosen an hourlong time limit for a group of my favorite sites and hadn't realized it had been anywhere near that long. But that's how it works, doesn't it? You wake up and get on reddit and before you know it it's 4pm and the day is gone and you've done nothing but fuck off on the internet. And your deadline jumps closer and the job isn't any closer to being done. So this is perfect. I can't wait to see what this does for my productivity and for stuff like making time to exercise and cook proper meals and all instead of obsessively clicking around for new content on reddit.

Note that you can have different sites or groups of sites that have different limits and rules. I put all of my worst sites in one basket together and figured out the hard way that my hourlong visit to reddit used up all the time I was allowed to spend on any of those sites in this 24 hour period.

###General Entrepreneurship Focus

* [Ever have trouble making business decisions?](http://blog.asmartbear.com/business-tiebreaker.html?) Jason Cohen writes a fantastic article focusing on a metric that he says (and I agree) should get much more attention than it does. 
* [It's Income Report time for May](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com/roundup-income-reports-for-may-from-around-the-web/). I love the tradition that Pat Flynn started and several other entrepreneurs now do too - breaking down *exactly* how much money they earned each month and through what channels. Really useful hard data.

* [Are you using Twitter Chats yet?](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-chat-guide/) - if you're in an  appropriate market

###Making Sales

* [Want to make more money out of the same customers?](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/boost-average-order-value/?) - A great piece on increasing Average Order Value per customer - goes a fair way beyond ""upsell something!"". 
* [An excellent practical example of benefit-focused sales copy](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/11/build-blog-products-that-sell-6-tell-the-world/?) - This one is pretty introduction-level in many ways

The best kept secret about start-ups (especially for first time entrepreneurs) is that you don't have to re-invent the wheel to be successful.

It's a secret because

2 Quick Examples:
1) Website - every start-up wants a super flashy website (even if they're not a web company) and so they invest tens or hundreds of hours into making the ""perfect"" website (which they typically don't have the in house skills to make). The end result is that they have a mediocre website and wasted tens/hundreds  of hours instead of doing customer development. Time and money would have been better spent on a $50 Wordpress theme (that doesn't even look like Wordpress) and 2 hours to setup the site. You can

2) Fundraising - same tune here. Every start-up's dream is to raise money. Why? Primarily, not another cool sticker for their MacBook Air!

I hear this all the time: ""How will I know if my customers will like it until I've built it?"" The answer is ""rapid-prototyping"" (aka ""just fake it""). Do you really want to invest all the time and effort it takes to make a product only to find out no one wants it? Well you may want to

Examples include:
Man Behind the Machine (aka artificial artificial intelligence): You hypothesize that you can grow your customer base by give existing users rewards for tweeting at your Twitter account when they achieve the next level? (or whatever, cron jobs...etc). Sure, it's hard work, but it's smarter than building a feature based on your gut.

Fake Landing Pages: You want to test your price point, names. Make a quick and dirty page with the info you're testing and then force the user to click a well-defined call to action (""Buy now"", ""Subscribe""). Collect their info and then send them to a ""product not available"" or ""out of stock"" page.

Mock-ups (aka looks-like, imagining what his life would be like if he actually built one. Cost: A BLOCK OF WOOD.

Focus on high ROI experiments. 
Hypothesize, analyze, repeat.

**Bottom Line:** The best generic piece of advice I can give to the founders of a start-up is to focus on adding value to their customers in such a way that the start-up can capture a piece of that value (aka monetize). 
If you spend your time and energy seeking out something customers will pay for (instead of on your website, over-engineering your product, etc), then I can guarantee that you'll learn a hell of a lot and be much more likely to be successful.

1353606149.0,13mmbc,We should consolidate 101 marketing tips into a reddit-worthy guide for FAQ+basics,leanstartup,77,23,6,"We should crowdsource a Reddit-worthy 101 guide to consolidate our small business marketing knowledge and reduce redundant posts. [Here](http://www.smalltownmarketing.com/101_marketing_ideas.html) is a good template. I have created the subreddit /r/marketing101 as a place to contribute content and suggestions to the guide on a continuous basis after this announcement post fades. Everything is open for editing/adding/replacing so the guide will never stop improving.

Categories: Basics, Sales, Analysis, Other

1. Branding - Develop a crisp, website, colors, tone and other marketing materials. Defining your USP is crucial to this process. Important graphics such as the logo should be vectorized. Research and pay attention to discover if your industry's customers want a fun, professional image or something else. Create letterheads, business cards, uniforms, you should have streamlined materials to give your clients at different stages throughout the relationship. 

2. Online Presence - List your website and contact information across free locations and register useful free products. These include: Yelp, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter (at least register name), Facebook (at least register name), Bing, Google Analytics, Flickr

3. Physical Presence - List your information in the local service or business directory. Join networks or clubs related to your customers and begin contributing genuinely valuable content.

4. Referrals - Plan/execute a referral strategy for your customers. This may include business cards, thank you notes, gifts, gift cards, a ""referral program"", continuous contact drips, birthday cards etc. Develop a relationship with important customers. High-quality work performance is obviously necessary. Be sure to repeat and emphasize that ""we rely on referrals for our new clients"".

5. SEO - Follow technical procedures

6. Farmers Markets - A good stepping stone during the early development phase. Cheap (especially with DIY-labor), repeated exposure to regular visitors, acts as an early feedback mechanism and is useful for developing a record of sales receipts or general traction. Generally requires a tent, table, chair, tablecloth and presentation/sales display. Ask customers to fill out questionnaires with valuable information such as grocery store shopping habits, email addresses and packaging or pricing preferences. Use this information for product development and to convince distributors.

7. Direct Mail -

8. Email Marketing - Constant contact

9. Adwords -

        * Use Google Keyword tool and target keywords with traffic
        * If you use broad match
        * Use the search query report to find out what people actually typed to trigger your keyword
        * Make negative keyword lists based on all the bad keywords from the step above
        * If budget is less than $1000/month it might be a good idea to use phrase match targeting 
        * See which keywords get good CTR's or conversions and change those to phrase match
        * Use tightly grouped ad groups tied to landing pages with matching features
        * Try to match title, bold/italics/underline when possible (do not overkill)
        * Find load speed on Google's Page Speed tool; it affects Quality Score and thus price for positions
        * Use Google Analytics and link it to your Adwords account without delay
        * Use Analytics goal tracking to track signups or sales or any goal
        * Use Adwords Conversion tracking
        * Click through rate affects Quality Score so periodically remove ads that don't convert
        * Don't make the mistake of making a small campaign. Make a ton of variations on an ad 
        * Tweak and test headlines
        * In the beginning you may not get conversions
        * Optimize Ad CTR
        * If a keyword does not bring enough traffic
        * Act on numbers
        * For small budgets
        * Find out keywords used by competitors and consider bidding on their brand or trademark names


10. Competitive Analysis - 

11. Media Coverage - 

12. Selling/Conversion Practices - Call to action

1350401896.0,11kocy,Another AdSense account suspended without reason (just a warning),adsense_throwaway,61,10,65,"I've been using Google AdSense since it was founded essentially.  Over the years I've noticed a lot of scary stories about accounts being suspended without much reason but have come to the conclusion that most of these stories end with the site having legitimate breaches of ToS (it's still kind of shitty of Google to give them no prior notice and not tell them why they're suspended).

I've since been VERY meticulously reading terms of service and have always been sure to follow them 100% but last week my account was suspended without reason and today my appeal was denied without reason and Google has stated they will not communicate with me any further on this issue.

I've made thousands of dollars with Google AdSense and have been very loyal to them and it's just pretty shitty that they would do this to me with no explanation.  I'm truly baffled as to why my account was suspended.

I run a couple community forums and the only guess I have is that one of our angry users purposely clicked a bunch of our ads to get our account suspended (we recently had a bunch of drama where a few users very angrily left and wanted our forum shut down).  I mentioned that in the appeal but Google ignored it and wouldn't even tell me if that was the reason.

I understand they have to look out for their advertisers, and has made them tens of thousands of dollars is honestly just very hurtful and insulting :(

I was about to relaunch our site too and run a $1000 AdWords campaign but I'm too upset with Google to use their Ad services ever again I think.

Anyway this is just a warning.  Even if you think you're following the ToS and even if you're a well above average user

The best thing you can do

Know what you need to pay, call their help line.  They are surprisingly helpful.  

If you find yourself in a bind and can't pay what you owe

If you make a mistake

If you are politically inclined to not pay taxes, then the IRS can be a scary thing. If you are a small business owner trying to do right, the IRS is just another bureaucracy.  Their agents are people like you and me doing a job.  Make their job easy by keeping good records and showing intent to follow the rules, and they will be easy to work with.

Source: Personally was audited twice because of making mistakes in my business return (and then got smart and started using an accountant).  Went on a 2 year payment plan in the 5-digits.  Survived.


**Edit:** I would just like to emphasize that this advice is for new businesses.  If you can afford an accountant (or if you have a complex situation), as the audit rate for people making under $100K annually is less than 1%, I stand by the idea that you, as a beginning businessperson, can put forward a reasonable amount of effort and do your own taxes.  **Rather, don't let the fear of taxes or the inability to hire an accountant paralyze you from action.** It's not rocket science.

My company launched to the public in December in the midst of a lawsuit - check it out online here: [Inklyo.com](http://www.inklyo.com) (would love to hear any feedback!). I won't get into details since the case is ongoing

At this point, I can't finance any direct marketing campaigns to get the ball rolling and to start building market share. I'm also a 27 year old Canadian female... I have little to no klout in the online marketing world and no real reputable contacts to leverage. As such, I'm looking for any advice, lead, or ideas as to how I can either connect with some notable folks in my target market (more on that below) or get some much needed coverage from some reputable blogs. I need some serious uplift, and I need it asap.

I'm hoping that's where you guys can help me out.

About Inklyo: My company is designed to provide content development and copywriting outsourcing support specifically to marketing agencies and consultants - English only at this point. We are NOT a content farm - I've developed a system that enables me to employ and manage top notch writers

We produce high quality content, and we have some pretty stringent quality assurance measures in place.

About me: I'm a 27 year old female entrepreneur in Canada. I've bootstrapped this puppy from the ground up and am quite proud of the results. Without the lawsuit, and since I don't have a lot of sales, seeking investment is impossible - unless you considering giving the company away a fair trade.

I'm stuck, and even when we win, I'm worried that I'll be left with a pile of debt and a company that missed its window.

Anyone out there have any thoughts on ways to get some uplift?",self,t5_2qldo,1362524967.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/19pyg0/so_my_startup_is_getting_sued_need_to_scale_and/

There was a dollar pizza place that opened up right by my work. If you're not familiar with the model they rent very small spaces
 
It was an excellent area for it. No other low cost competitors. Very high foot traffic. I started going there for the cheap pizza. The owner was friendly and he had some of his family working there with him. I kept going back over the next two weeks even though it was pretty busy (lines 10+ deep out the door) because it was a) cheap
 
The place was doing really well. 
 
Unfortunately
 
So what did he do? 
 
Reasonable response: Get one of those markers that detects counterfeits. Check all large currency bills and continue with business as usual.  
 
Completely unreasonable response: Get one of those markers that detects counterfeits. Put up multiple signs stating that if you were caught passing a counterfeit bill you would be physically detained until the cops arrived. Stop being friendly and start treating all your customers with suspicion
 
Now
 
I never went there again because I didn't like being treated like a criminal when I had done nothing wrong. And apparently other people felt the same day because within three days of this they went from having a line out the door every single day at lunch time to being a ghost town. Every time I walked past there was maybe 1-2 people inside.  
 
I have rarely been happy to see a place shut down

1331565234.0,qsz4z,Finally taking the plunge... the beginning of something fun,redbenn,52,6,8,"I am taking the first steps to opening a brewery. Like many of the posters in this subreddit, and rewriting it hundreds of times (which I need to update again this week)


We are [Oval Brewing Company](http://ovalbrewing.com), yet only has a handful of breweries with very little output.

I started my obsession with beer when I started homebrewing 2 years ago. From the beginning I started researching what it would take to start a brewery... which is not easy, I have been educating myself on all aspects I can from the business side to the brewing side. I have partnered with a friend of mine who is an extremely talented graphic designer and have been building our branding as we work towards building the rest of the business. I am taking classes on the technical aspects of brewing from the Siebel Institute, which is one of the top brewing schools in the world.

We started a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the) at the beginning of February, and have some traditional investors as well... but we have gotten some great exposure because of the campaign, and it will help us with a lot of the up front costs during the first few months.

If any of you are interested in backing

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers. You will get to vote on the label design, style, strength, and name! And regardless of your pledge level, your Reddit username will be displayed on the can*!

I just launched my first startup yesterday called [Chatalyst](http://chatalyst.co).

**What I'm doing:** Chatalyst gives you the functionality of Omegle/Chatroulette by matching you up with other users to chat with but goes one step further. We allow users to save each other to private message later

The eventual goal is to monetize users by using the main site as a conversion funnel to a subscription based dating site with similar functionality. I'll probably have ads and some purchasable add-ons as well.

**How it was done**
Chatalyst was built in 3 months time with no funding other than my own savings. I did all the development work myself which I had to learn as I went. I had a designer friend craft the logo for me. Chatalyst was pretty extensively user tested and QA'ed prior to launch which I'm pretty thankful for since the market I'm targeting (18-26

**What I would have done better**

* I should have thought about press and presence months in advance. I originally spent 100% of my time on building the site

* I should have had a splash page to capture user signups/emails months before the site went live. The idea came way too late

* I should have user tested consistently throughout the development process. Since I was confident in the assumptions I made off some early testing prior to development

After graduating three years ago with a degree in digital video and cinema studies I obtained a job as a video producer for a marketing company. After twelve months my company was purchased and I got a pink slip. I freelanced my video work for 3 months and made a good bit of money. I loved the freedom and the pay wasn't half bad. Fast forward and I landed a job (I don't know why I stopped freelancing in the first place) at one of the greatest companies in the US. It didn't pay a lot but I thought I'd love it forever. Six months in I realized it wasn't where I should be. Today I am proud to say I handed in my two weeks notice and will be freelancing full-time. I'm looking to do a lot of video production and video marketing work through my connections I have built up.

But I've also dabbled in making money online and could really use some guidance. I have a background in WordPress, Graphic Design and Photography. I really want to create some nice sources of passive income. I've blogged here and there and tried to make money on the adsense clicks but I can't figure out how to get tons of traffic. One blog I started was collegegraduateguide.com and it's still up, I've just been lazy with posting to it.

How can I secure my financial future now that I've taken the huge leap? How can I make money online and what are some good tips for doing so?

edit: I was lazy with the blog because honestly I didn't know how to do it. I learned from scratch and from reading up online. I'm not expecting to become a millionaire on it overnight nor am I expecting to make money for doing nothing. I'm willing to put in all of the work up from (if I know exactly what I need to do).

Feedback good or bad would be amazing. Looking to know what we are doing right as well as wrong.    



Our old site was put together by a ""web guy"" with a good reputation and an amazing portfolio. He set up the shopping cart system and ""designed"" the frame of the website for us to go in and place all the products on our own. We ended up paying him $6

We hated waiting for him to update the site and it costs money every time we needed something changed or added. We decided to leave him and redo the site with Shopify. It is by far the smartest decision we have made as a business so far. If you are looking for a simple eCommerce solution that offers great support I would highly recommend Shopify.    
- Shopify template = $150    
- Shopify Monthly Plan = $59    

If you know how to use a site like facebook or have edited a myspace profile

We later found out that Magento was free and our ""web guy"" just purchased a template. Costs for him was probably around $300 and he turned around and charged us $6

A friend and myself live in a highly populated suburb in the U.K. There is a crazy amount of dirty takeaways on the main street however it is extremely hard to get a good burger after 4 PM. We are just finishing university so we are strapped for cash. 

**Our Idea**

Create a burger company that delivers a high quality/gourmet burger to your door within 45 mins with fries for five pound.

* We will be doing this from home.

* There are two of us.

* Open from 4/5-12ish

* Prep everything before opening

* If it works and we start making money apply for grants and open a shop.

* Prices will increase to cover additional overheads of opening a shop.

* Business is registered.

* We know our kitchen at home needs to be inspected etc.

We are having problems figuring out what certificates or licenses we may need to begin trading. We'd also like to hear of any ideas or setbacks you can think of that we may encounter. We hope to post our progress through this month as we are hoping to have our first opening on the 7th of June. 

Edit: More detail

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback so far guys!! A number of people have commented on the bun going soggy and the burger losing heat through transit. I'm actually going to test now how effective it is at keeping heat by wrapping it in tin foil after cooking and letting it sit for twenty minutes.

So my partner and I decided to make a map (first in print and later [web/phone app](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/phone-app.jpg)) that could show these places. 


This is the result. We’ve made a beautiful (if I may say so about my own creation) [map that shows bars, theaters, music and strange curiosities of Lyon](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/plie002.jpg). 
We’ve been inspired by [Situationist maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) where we don’t show everything in the city


We believe this concept can take off


As for the business part of all this; we’re [selling our maps](http://www.lavillenue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-04-16.52.05.jpg) in several stores throughout Lyon right now
We also try to participate as much as we can in student reunions- this night for example we’re going to a polyglot club (language club) with around 70 people and we’ll have a stand in a corner showing off our maps. 


We have a facebook page and blog in which we post (not very often I should admit) but that has given us some traffic and we’ve got around 70 likes on our page. I’m not sure if that a lot or not


The launch week
At this moment we’re planning to make a video to market the brand a bit and post it on facebook. We had a [good experience with videos on facebook before](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=393440587359447)

My idea:

Have a haunted house where individuals go in one at a time, are given a baseball bat. Once in the room, a rubber dummy on wheels with it's head made of a laxex zombie mask on a watermelon, ""attacks"" the participant and they have to kill it by smashing its deliciously refreshing head in. The carnage is filmed for later purchase. A cleanup crew squeegees the mess up and glues the mask on a new watermelon and sets it up for the next guy. Admission would be about 29.99. Have at it.

",TEKSTartist,48,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/lswv6/hey_rentrepreneur_im_less_than_a_month_away_from/

I'm sure many of you know right where I am at. Past efforts have brought both epic failure and a few reasonable successes. This time though things are very different and I wanted to share the things that REALLY mattered (to me) when starting a business:

* **Find/Build A Team You Can Trust**- This has been one of the hardest things for me to accomplish as an entrepreneur. Finding people that have true drive

* **There is NOTHING more important that Passion and Persistence** - Doing what you love both pushes you through the tough times and improves the quality of your (business) life like nothing else. If you don't love it you will either fail

* **ASK And Ye Shall Receive** - Perhaps the most recent lesson learned is once you know what you want don't be afraid to ASK. Ask for help, ask for things you don't think are possible.

* **Aim Higher** - One thing past successes have taught me is to aim higher. I'm sure you have been there- you set a goal

I know a lot of this is common sense

I have been pouring every ounce of my energy and nearly every second of free time since March into the biggest business venture I have ever embarked on.

Numerous sources have said I should use Shopify. I have heard it is much easier to use and there is no need to worry about servers and code customisation. There is also no additional costs for hosting on Shopify and you can get your domain name through them as well. With regards to Magento on this
Plans I'm looking at are similar in price

So basically I am a website ""Noob"" who is looking for any information at all on comparison between these two platforms. Are there any readers who did not know much about web design but were successful is designing one? One question I do have though is whether or not I am able to select a Theme on Magento and then incorporate it onto Shopify's platform? I ask this because I think there is not many decent themes in the Shopify store for what I want to sell and I am willing to pay a little more for a decent design.

But one book I read recently stands out: [*From Predators to Icons*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080147566X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=froseaboo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=080147566X) (Amazon). I came across it in this [*New Yorker article*](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/18/100118fa_fact_gladwell) by Malcom Gladwell. 

A few of my favorite quotes from the book:

**On vision...**
""The entrepreneur is often presented as a visionary, the strategy that will lead to his success.  Our careful study of career biographies suggests rather a process of improvement through trial and error, depending on opportunities, a sequence of improvised adaptations gradually assembled into a coherent course of conduct: the celebrated ""strategy"" was often only the rationalization after the fact of the conditions of success.""  Cites Sam Walton and Ingvar Kamprad as examples.

**On innovation...**
""It is often said that success in business is the reward for those who have been able to innovate, when we consider closely the careers of the thirty-two businessmen in our sample, it becomes clear that innovation is not chronologically the first cause of their success.  Innovation is an expensive and risky process that is difficult to protect and takes a long time to produce profits; it requires first of all the means to pay for it and control it.  We propose to consider innovation as a means of consolidating and ensuring the duration of wealth, which, unless it is inherited, first has to be acquired by other means, in particular by what might be provocatively called ""predation""."" Cites LVHM as example--owner of Dior, Louis Vutton

**On risk-taking...**
""In fact

**Info about their sample set of 32 entrepreneurs who increased their wealth by a factor of 100 within 20 years**

    - 56% of the businessmen came from families that were among the 10% of the most wealthy in the country in which they were raised.
    - 62% are Europeans
    - 91% enjoyed favorable conditions for the financing of their first companies
    - 72% had parents in an independent
    - 56% already knew their future customers or suppliers before going into business for themselves
    - 72% indicate that obtaining or holding onto exclusive information was a decisive factor at some stages of their career
    - 69% have made threats in the course of negotiations, competitors (34%)
    - 63% indicate that at some point in his career, government, customers, or suppliers
    - 22% -- invented their own technical innovations
    - 44% -- the innovation came from a close associate
    - 22% -- the innovation was stolen
    - 22% -- the innovation was acquired in advantageous conditions (weak negotiating position)

I'm 23, since my hobbies include politics, both local and national, science, business, and of course the internet and it's ceaseless debate over the oxford comma, I can at least get across that I'm well informed.  I work as a cell phone salesman for a major company.  I wasn't getting enough hours, I realized I was going to have to find a source of income elsewhere.  

I put an ad up on craigslist (link by request) advertising myself and my friends as local ""under employed 20 somethings ready to work for you.""  The response was surprising.  Within a couple days I had more job requests than myself and my one friend who was in on it could handle.  I accepted all the jobs I could and put up an ad on craigslist looking for people who could be movers.  The next morning I was hiring at a nearby starbucks before an afternoon moving job.  At the interviews I stressed the business model that I believe in: do an amazing job

I hired 3 guys that morning.  They were the first three I interviewed, I work 20 hours a week as a wage slave, and as I don't think I mentioned, another 20 hours a week as a volunteer for a local environmental conservation group.  I had to get at least three guys to a job site at a time when I was scheduled to work my day job.  I made it clear the all the interviewees that I have a lot going on and I'm going to rely on them to be kick ass.  They seemed to appreciate the trust.  I explained that I would be charging 12 an hour and paying them 10, but I wouldn't be making a profit on new customers.  With the profit margin from any first job for a client, I spend it on a gift for them.  Because of the time of year, we're getting a lot of moving gigs.  I bring moving clients a vase and flowers to welcome them to their new home.  I explained how the only way I make any money is if I'm either working along side them, the more they care about the mission and want to do their best for me.  I've worked in management before

I pulled a favor with a co worker at my cell phone sales job to let me escape for an hour off the record.  I made it to the job site right as the client was scheduled to arrive.  She was late.  I took the opportunity to hand out a welcome letter I had written between the interviews and my day job.  It went over most of the basics.  What we do, the client was under the impression I would be doing the move along side my men.  When I explained that I would soon have to leave, she seemed distraught and I felt a negative feeling come over her.  Luckily I hadn't yet deployed the secret weapon.  I grabbed the bouquet and vase I'd gotten for her -about $18.00 after tax- and placed it on her kitchen counter near one of our fliers. I helped grab a few things out of the truck, and then ran to the store to grab some water and sun screen for the guys.  When I got back I helped unload at hyperspeed for about 30 minutes, talked to the client a bit about whether there was anything else I could get going for her to make her life easier.  She explained that she had more to move than she had anticipated and that she would need us again tomorrow.  I happily agreed.  When I left to get back to work, she now seemed understanding and at peace about my leaving.  I think I was able to communicate to her that I would be there if I could, but my life is crazy just like hers.  She seemed to sympathize. 
For reasons you'll realize are important in about one line, and I wasn't able to reach one of them to confirm the second day's work.  I had 1 confirmed for what was at least a 3 man job, and I realized I would need to hire again.  The response for my ""Movers Needed 8/1"" was so dramatic I'd taken it down, but i'd sifted through the emails and voice mails and only scheduled interviews with those that weren't clearly incompetent.  I reposted the ad, changing only the date to 8/2.  By morning I had several emails and a couple of voice mails, even though I'd noted clearly in the ad that I wouldn't be taking calls before 9 am.  Using the responses as a rough filter, I scheduled two more interviews and hired two more guys
I worked my day job at 1:00 and the gig was at 3:00.  I pulled a different co worker aside and asked them to repay a favor.  I was going to need to leave twice today.  At 2:00 I got a call from the worker I was unable to touch base with the previous night or this morning.  He told me that he was at the site but the client wasn't.  ""No shit."" I told him.  The job wasn't until 3:00, and told him he would have to wait. 
I left work to join the crew at the gig at 2:50.  While I was on the way I received a call from the client telling me she was just now departing with the uhaul
I got to the site, went over a couple basics, and then broke the news.  After telling them she wasn't going to be on time, I broke down the situation.  I explained that it wouldn't be sustainable for me to pay for work that I'm not getting paid for, and that at the same time it's not fair to have them be here when they aren't getting paid.  I explained that on the ride over, the best idea I'd come up with to keep this from happening agian was to remember to confirm with clients the time we're starting, and make it clear the clock starts then.  I opened the floor to the guys, but no one complained about the situation either.  I think they genuinely understood the dilemma and agreed I was doing all I could fairly do.
I got a hold of the client at 3:30, but I would have to start billing her for this time.  She agreed.  I informed the guys that they were now on the clock, to enjoy the sun and I headed back to work.  I'd put my 19 year old with a great attitiude in the team lead position.  The team lead makes 11 an hour, while regular crew makes 10.  I mix up who's team lead with every job and give everyone a chance to perform.  I'll narrow down on the superstars as they prove themselves.  I always have the team lead text me when they think they're about 20-30 minutes from finished so I can try to get out there.  I pulled yet another favor and left work once I heard they were almost done.  I got there just in time to help finish taking the last few things out of the truck.  We finished up and the client asked me to help her get the uhaul back to the station.  I thought about how we should do it for a minute and asked her if she'd be willing to drop me off back at my work which happened to be right next to the uhaul place.  She agreed.  I paid the guys out of cash I'd picked up from an ATM earlier in the day.  I realized that my estimate was about 20 bucks off, and that because of the pizza I was short.  I politely and carefully asked the client if I could snag $20 of her bill right now to help pay the guys, and she promptly agreed. 
I got the guys all paid up, me driving her van and her in the uhaul.  We got to the uhaul station, I moved over to the passenger seat and took the quick trip to my work.  We parked as she started to write out a check.  I calculated the hours, putting down only a single one for myself.  As she was writing out the check, she shared her concerns about the state of her garden, the condition of the house, and how she would have to call the Geek Squad to get her electronics set up.  I quickly assured her that those are all things I would be thrilled to help her with for way less than others would charge and with our level of customer service and she seemed relieved.

The details: I run a lifestyle magazine, we've decided to go into printing. The costs are big, but the profits are bigger (better advertisement and of course revenue from sales).

**What I did at first:** Put together a list of what specifications we needed to print, these guys came down a lot in price and became the cheapest on the list too! They said we'd get an extra 10% discount if we paid up front, and cause cash flow is always a problem in small businesses, I said yes.

**What happened:** They never delivered

**What I did wrong:** 

- Didn't check for any reviews of the printer

- Paid everything up front to a NEW supplier. (Seriously

- Did not do any sort of credit check on them. Even something simple such as seeing their past history would have shown that they were a mere 6 months old

- Happily went along without being suspicious of their cheap prices yet good service.


**Lessons learned

- Do a credit check on them. Go to Companies House (or wherever their company was registered) and see that they're a legitimate business that files returns on time and pays taxes.

- Check for reviews. In fact the best way to do this is using keywords on google such as ""company name + fraud"" 

- Agree to better payment terms! Never give everything up front unless you are an exceptionally small fish in the pond, which they are happy to comply with.

I tried a company where I taught langues one-on-one over the Internet (people signed up for free trials, but realized pressuring friends sucks), I started a stand up comedy club that made some money ($3000) but never really had growth potential, I tried an importing business since I speak Chinese - had one order from a hotel that went wrong and I ended up losing around $6000. I tried a web design company with a friend where I would do the sales and we didn't find one person interested. And I'm currently working on an idea that seemed to be going well (no orders, but lots of interest) but now I'm getting burnt out because I'm not getting any actual orders.

My website has been a side project for the last three months or so

Website is in the literature niche. It provides curated public-domain literature snippets with critical commentary.

My process for starting the site looked like this:

1) Niche research with the free version of Market Samurai. Looked around niches I was interested in

2) Bought an exact match domain for the keyphrase. This was a HUGE mistake, much better for linkbuilding / guest blogging

3) Designed the site (edited a free WP theme to do what I wanted it to do: minimal php and JS/html/css knowledge required).

4) Made the content: found all the primary content in old books and wrote all the analysis myself.

5) building links: 100% guest blogging. Approached high-authority blogs with personalized pitches. Scored some great links in exchange for well-tailored content

6) Did lots of A/B testing with ad copy

So I'm presently burning through savings to keep the lights on.  With top talent comes a very costly payroll and I just can't do it for much longer.

How you could help:

- Web-based software development work. As much as I'd like to take on any work available

The idea of 48 Hour Websites is to take the hassle and cost out of setting up a website. My target customers are small business owners who generally don’t have the time to organize a website, pubs, and small local shops.

Each website starts off with 3 pages (home, domain registration and the construction of the site. To order a website, the customer simply completes a questionnaire, with the answers being used to create the site content.

I construct the websites using one of 3 basic HTML templates I created. Even though they are a little plain

I also decided to make website updates and changes free (for example

Things have actually been going very well, rather than waste their time on the phone explaining everything. 

I also feel the ‘small business owner to small business owner’ approach works really well when cold calling

Majority of the customers I have found so far have come from Facebook, etc email address). With the businesses from Facebook, I will use their logo to create a draft website with one of my templates, then send a link to it along with my email. So far I have signed up 100% of the customers I have done this with.

Does this sound like an idea that could be expanded on? My short-term success has been very encouraging, I’d love to be able to expand and start contacting small businesses around the country.

More on the Problem - Over the years we've tried various incentive structures, mastery, purpose applies directly, but that's been my issue - taking money off the table (paying well to start) hasn't helped (much) and I want more ownership of everyone's tasks/projects.

Well, whose business life would flourish that much better with the perfect software solution. The best idea(s) will get their software built free, and own a 50/50 share of the intellectual property rights. Yes, you heard right: I'm going to build it for you, and give you half of the rights to it. The only rights I'll reserve are the right to sell the software myself (my real ulterior motive!), the right to name the software as I please, and of course the right to modify and customize the software as I see fit. There may be some other rights in there, is that you should also have the same rights too!

My name is Jim

You can either list your ideas for the perfect software for your business below, but I do want to put some ground rules in-place:

1) You should either have, but would be better off with that software. This rule essentially keeps the ""I have a great idea, just build my entire business for me"" folks, at bay.

2) The software will be built on my own time, I can't unfortunately also deliver free AND fast at the same time. If I could do that, I wouldn't be browsing reddit before work. Does that make sense? No? You're right, I should browse reddit all the time - oh me!

2a) Although I can assure you of quality workmanship, bugs, errors, omissions, or losses to you, your business, your neighbor, nor am I going to build the next facebook for you. Chances are pretty slim that the software that I build for you will cause you a loss. In the event that it does, either).

3) I'd like anyone who wishes to work with me to put some real thought into this, not mine. I'm just writing the software for you. No one knows your business like you do, and that's why I need you as much as you might need me.

4) I will ultimately be in charge of what platform(s) and language(s) the software is written in. If this software ends up requiring an expensive platform to run on, for whatever reason (hypothetical here), an Oracle DB, and SAP integration, then I will not be providing Oracle, nor SAP components for your business. I, of course, but cannot be held liable to provide any hardware or software for your business. That part is on you

5) I really dislike rules. They limit us, there are probably some other rules that I'm not thinking of, but what you can be sure of, is that you will always get an equal say in how these rules are implemented from here-on. IOW: the rules I've stated are probably the only ones that I will lay down, but there may be some others that we can agree upon later!

That's all folks

Of course, of course, we know very little of business - only what we've picked up along the way from our families, random textbooks and various business subreddits. I tend to be the one who comes up with ideas in regards to expansion. 

Projects we currently have on the table:

3 Chic Geeks Magazine - published via MagCloud and aim to sell print copies to local cafes and bookstores in the hipster areas of NYC. Quarterly publication

Self-hosting and adding ads + sponsored posts - while we are currently running the wordpress.com version of AdSense

&gt;Our current stats:

&gt;Total views: roughly 217k

&gt;Monthly average views: ~40k 

&gt;Subscribers: 575 (we gained 75 since April 2nd)

&gt;FB likes: 457

&gt;Twitter followers: 270

&gt;Founded: November 5th

Please note

Our goal is, and we are open to expanding beyond blogging with the 3 Chic Geeks brand. I am hoping to get feedback from the people who have more experience with growing a business than I do.

1348531195.0,10f5vm,Just lost what would have been the largest sale for my company,whollyhemp,39,9,33,"I guess this is less of a question and more of a light rant. 

I just got out of class and checked my phone to see an email from [wholesale company I submitted my products to when I first opened and subsequently forgot about] with an abnormally large number of units. I put my stuff down and double checked to make sure. Yeah. HUGE. 

I rushed home and checked the wholesaler's vendor page. That's when I remembered something: they made me sell all my products AT COST.

While this wouldn't necessarily be an issue

I started doing the math

I would have to wait on raw materials which would delay shipment by one week. Not too bad

I contacted the wholesaler to see what the shipping time frame was. They wouldn't answer. I called

So I waited a few hours hoping they would get back to me. Nothing.

I finally did the one thing they said I could not do- I contacted the company which purchased my products. When they answered

They were very responsive

OUCH. 

I told them that I was unfortunately unable to fulfill the order and they said if there is another similar need they will come back to me. 

They always say the greatest danger of owning a small business is growing too fast. 

Sending inferior product/late orders is unacceptable. I would rather begrudgingly turn down an order than lower my standards. I also could not keep that much inventory on hand 'in the hopes of receiving another hail mary order'. 

But it does pang me to think 'what if...'

Thank you everyone whom responded to my original post - I would love to do all the ideas with you guys
  

As the [top up voted idea from my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/xz5o5/choose_and_ride_along_with_a_reddit_startup/) was the Microphone Ball

1) I've spent the weekend going through around 4000 patents to see if I'm infringing on anyone. So far so good! Am meeting with an attorney friend of mine a bit later this week to discuss what I need to do in terms of patents etc to protect myself. *Would you like me to film the conversation?*  

2) Based on input from Xenos345 &amp; sigmaecho

I also made a quick [intro video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtWhSyyUbLU) to the first prototype

1373211841.0,1ht0ah,Should I allow two technical cofounders to have 50% of their equity (30% each) unvested 4 months in?,vestingissues,35,6,27,"The background:

I'm a non technical guy &amp; came up with an idea, validated it with customer feedback and made business plan, entered another entrepreneurial competition (15 min presentation) won ($5000). Met two iOS developers, we got along well and they liked the idea so they joined the team. We agreed on an equity split of (40/30/30).


We got into an incubator and have been working here full-time since after exams since may. The app is nearly done and we're planning to launch in august.


I have applied for multiple accelerators - we were even shortlisted for the best one in our country. The one developer was 100% in to join us while the other was going to go back to school. Then the one that was game for the acceleration had lots of influence from his parents and family and he decided he is going to go back to school. This makes us unable to get into that accelerator. We apply to another one that isn't as prestigious but they more likely to have us come in with just one full time founder. 


I can deal with them developing while at school. The issue is that after the one came back from a family vacation


We agreed we will have this conversation at another point in time (before we release the app) but they seem pretty keen on getting 50% of equity unvested.


Two reasons I can think they want the 50%:

* 1. they truly believe they're work is worth 50% of their equity

* 2. they are worried two of the cofounders will for whatever reason kick the other one out.


Notes on reason 1: They haven't thought out all the other features we are going to include in the app (there's a lot). They haven't realized all the other work dealing with the startup (I don't know what to expect because it's my first tech startup). Haven't taken into account that we might have a major pivot.


Notes on reason 2: With 50% equity already unvested, but get $50,000 of that after 4 months of work and we can keep that even if we walk off - it's likely we would walk off before the 3 years end."" So if one us doesn't care so much about our work it's likely that the other two would want to do something about it. 

Not only will it effect our individual motivation but if one cofounder leaves with half their equity and isn't working - it will effect the motivation of the team. 

It will also effect us when trying to raise VC funds. 


At the incubator I told of the the directors (who also happens to be a partner at an Angel Network) about this issue and he said he would help have a talk with us and explain to them the issues about their request.


Also how much (if any) extra equity should I ask for because I'm going to the accelerator and not going back to school while the others are? Keep in mind I have put in about $5000 into this startup (from the winnings) which has been paying for the developers rent

Edit:wow
when i was 14 i became my own third party supplier and retailer for a trading card game called duelmasters.

(this was during the japanese revival of the game after the decline and subsequent discontinuation of the english series by wizards of the coast

Made only 20% of the total cost of goods available for sale(total revenue was actually 180% of COGAS) due to a large amount of drawings by me to buy cards for my personal use

i guess it taught me that my business should not interfere with my hobby and not to pass up a good opportunity.
It has also taught me that the Internet isn't everything when it comes to retail

I love this sub and have learned a lot.  However

In an effort to build a little more community

Here is the question set

1. Do you currently own a business?

2a.  If yes

2b.  If no

3. What are your top 3 skillsets

**My Answers**

1. Yes

2. I run an online marketing agency that primarily focuses on technical search engine optimization (site architecture, etc) and what I call ""real online marketing"" (content planning/promotion, outreach, build marketing systems for clients).  I used to call this SEO, but I've grown to hate that acronym and no longer use it at all.

3. I'm pretty good at:

A. Going from idea -&gt; revenue.  I've started a bunch of mini businesses: growing and selling produce to restaurants, etc.

B. Rapidly figuring out what sucks about a marketing strategy and how to improve it.  After being in this game for so long

C. Systems and process. This is what took me from basically creating a job for myself (consultant) to an agency where all of the work doesn't rely 100% on my being behind a computer working away.

D. (oops a 4th).  Strategy.  I played online poker professionally

TLDR: If you don't want to read the entire story

Backstory:

I started business with my partner about a year ago. We both went to school for the same thing

We started a Web &amp; Graphic Design company and started off well. We branded ourselves

About 3 months in, he had as much experience as I did but apparently I was wrong. It was fine, because he was alright at logos and other small graphic projects.

I made a point to say hey

A month later, he didn't even know how to get the site set up through FTP.

I offered to pay for an online course, and get the most out of it that he could.

He had it for 3 months

This resulted in a serious email stating that something needed to change, where it's constantly changing and you need to be up to date. He said he'd change, and work really hard.

This is where we're at now

Part of it is me needing to grow some balls and tell him to take a hike

So my question is has anyone had an experience where they needed to can their business partner

In a nutshell I have a meeting with a millionaire who will give me insane amounts of money for a new business if I can convince him that it will be profitable.

Have to work now until tomorrow. If you need additional information I will try and provide it while at work

EDIT: Hey, if anything it is the other way around :) I wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented with great ideas and gave me enough links and ideas. I will use them to the best of my ability. I will make a rough business frame, based on our club in London, which is very profitable and will add a couple of my own ideas that I know will work. After some research I have decided that it is safer to buy an existing strip club with existing licence, otherwise it can take a year just to get it, and if I don't have any other business's running that will generate me money, it is not  worth it.

My idea is to help budding entrepreneurs with the right idea to execute it fast. The way it works is, I help you setup your own large office with the team that has been working for you and provide you assistance setting an offshore development team.

The way I would distinguish from other outsourcing companies is that I am not after the monthly payments but my main source of revenue will be the successful startups. Therefore

My question is:

1. Would you pay for such a service

2. Would you mind giving away your equity and rather pay extra to keep 100% of it? 

3. If you went this way

4. What would you like me to have that would qualify me to be able to pull this through? I currently have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from a decently ranked school in USA.

I am looking to substantiate a new startup idea I have worked on over the past few weeks. Any advice

In my experiences, I believe the process can be improved. My idea will create a cloud-based platform where college students can share, rate and collaborate on one another’s notes. This differs from current note taking applications (Evernote, Google Drive, etc.) by forcing the user to write his/her notes in an outline format. The system can then take their notes and generate summaries, study guides, etc. per lecture/semester. 

 

Ultimately

Can you see value in this platform?

How would you see yourself using the Application?

I thought i'd share the progress so far, and if anyone still had some good advice to give me as I continue onwards.

**Backstory //**

A long time now, others with Android, And I just enjoy the fact that they come to me for this advice.

Long story short, the first thing I did was look up the tv on Amazon to see the price difference. To no surprise, the television was cheaper on Amazon, by a couple hundred dollars.

It occurred to me that my grandparents didn't even think to price check online. My grandpa is 100% offline and my grandmother has only managed to master email

There's an entire generation out there that just doesn't know you can buy things online.
And it just so happens that Amazon doesn't have a physical showroom

My answer to this problem is to open a physical showroom at the mall in my town (I live in the U.S.)

I would display and allow people to demo everything, Mobile Devices, Laptops, and Cameras.

Go on and find a place where you can physically demo the Apple tv, So they continue paying for overpriced cable subscriptions just because it's all they know.

___________________________________________________________________________

**My progress so far //**

My initial post about this on Reddit got a lot of really good advice and opinions. 
And I went on to make a [Business Plan] (https://plus.google.com/photos/104043119146057910218/albums/5800311728482256353?authkey=CMf5gI-JgNKAfA)

I had to edit the personal information. You understand. I also had trouble making a PDF pretty to look at online. Not the Nerd I thought I was.
Also I'd like to note I personally designed everything about this plan. (I'm a self proclaimed artist

I talked with the Local SBA representative in my area
After I had my plan together
My first stop was at Chase Bank, obviously I wouldn't qualify, So i went to a couple of other banks, and they all said the same thing. 

&gt;You need better credit son

Alright
The SBA rep advised me to find an investor or a cosigner for a bank loan.

I found an investor and for privacy reasons I can't tell you who they are, and after explaining my idea and letting them mull it over, I got the OK, and was now $15,000 richer.

In order to open a business checking account you need a DBA.
So
So, and applied for a DBA.
Literally took less than 10 minutes

So I opened my business checking

Now to get leasing in order.
Went to the Mall, right in the center of everything, unbelievable.)

Paperwork for that has been completed.

Well after reading around and asking more questions for clarity

Here are the [Participation Requirements](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/operating/participation/)

Up until then
I figured I might have a little trouble with using the same computers around my showroom to ""check"" people out

This obviously threw me off my streak. I had that terrible sinking feeling in my stomach.

I went into problem solving mode
I called customer support

So I try the email routine. It takes 24 hours for a response. So I send
I couldn't eat. Or move.

I had finally gotten over my fear of talking with people, it's much worse meeting professional strangers and asking about my business.

Anyways, and They won't send you to the Business Development department unless you ask for someone by name. That department only does contact by snail mail or email. And I wasn't given an email. So I contact the Affiliate Customer Support via Email, and they respond with a physical mailing address and what to send.

So I mail a copy of my business plan along with a cover letter explaining my situation.
I did this a week and half ago on priority shipping.
I contact everyone again trying to get some kind of faster contact

The only way I can talk to someone with Amazon is for them to Contact me.
The waiting is killing me. And as big and as busy as Amazon is

So
And I'm hoping this is just the part of the movie where everything bad that can happen does

That's my progress so far on my venture.
Take it as you well. Thank you for reading this ungodly long post. My goodness I went way overboard.

First off

Here is my current situation.
-I am in St. Louis Missouri.
- I have $20
- I own my own house.
- I am 24
- I am making $40
- My car is paid off.

Now, and I want to invest in a 3-4 family townhome. I figure if I find one for $170,000 (which is reasonable around here) I can rent the other three units for $700/mo. That is $2,100 per month minus the mortgage which will be about $1,200 monthly. This leaves me with $900 profit barring any repairs or emergencies that come up.

My question to you guys is:

What are the caveats I should be aware of with this plan? 

I'm sure there are many factors I am overlooking as I have never done this before. 
My 3 year goal would be to stash most if not all of the profit from the units

What specifics do I need to be weary/aware of?

Anyways I have an idea that I have been mulling over for many many months and I just need a ""nudge"" to go from a thinker to a do-er. 

Background: I work full time as a service technician. I am in customers homes all day and routinely engage into conversations about employment/business. 

I was servicing a customer about 6-8 months ago who runs a very successful ebay business. After speaking in great length with her I realized that she is making incredible money, using 9% as a benchmark I calculated she made gross roughly 430,000 last year. 

She has it set up like so... She pays .06/.15 cents per unit via china manufacturing, but it's very constant. 

My thought is this- She uses NO technology.. IE- someone purchases 5 auctions at 1.00/piece. she then manually logs into paypal

I've already done some test runs automating both paypal invoice printing as well as shipping labels completely automatic. From speaking with her she spends 6-7 hours a day just doing paperwork and tasks in which could be automated.

I'm forced with both fear and moral dilemmas. First the fear of failure

Secondly is the aspect that I am ""stealing"" someones business in order to make it more streamline and efficient. Should this be crossing my mind? While I was there I gave this lady multiple ideas for automation/time saving

Now we're consistently getting clients for $2500 and up and the trend is that we'll continually be able to increase these costs as we work with larger companies. We complete about 4-6 videos per month. We've done work for Intuit, and a few other *somewhat* notable companies. We currently have 16 projects in the works and get requests through our website for videos every day.

1345650930.0,yn59f,Some website hints for entrepreneurs,guaboy05,33,8,13,"Some time ago I engaged in a discussion about web stuff
All things here are written from my own experience. I don't promote any business, as always, there is more to it, be aware people.
So we start with hosting...

1.	Hosting type – you must do it yourself, you can check which other domains are your neighbors: http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-sites-on-web-server/ (it is called “reverse IP domain check""). There are also semi-dedicated and dedicated servers (hosting types). It means that server works only for you, or for a small number of other sites. Further step is to have your own server. But that costs. Those steps would be a must-do only if your web has extensive traffic and lot of web shop activities.
2.	Most of the hosting companies deceive you by mentioning irrelevant facts, you can cheaply get, let’s say 20 GB, and then discover that your bandwidth – traffic – is some 30 GB, and most likely, if you run your site well, somewhere during the month your visitors will get “bandwidth exceeded” message. So, try to estimate amount of disk space you need on server
3.	Next,99% uptime, but don’t be deceived. Sometimes it is just sweet promises, and servers do crash, perform maintenance and so on. Also, there are server firewall settings that prevent access to some IP's, be careful here. You can check your uptime if you have some paid service to do it. They will monitor for you. Which brings us to
4.	24 hrs support. That means simply that there are some real people taking care of your possible problems: someone will hack you, you are back. That is crucial for any business on the net – some very famous and big hosting companies simply don’t care about your site. Hey, they are busy making money. Or supporting SOPA and PIPA (whatever those are called). So, you have to pay attention: if those guys are doing your backup and respond to your needs – you are a happy person.
5.	Yep, hacked, site full of viruses, whatever, and you don’t want your site in which you put time or money or both to simply vanish. And data, especially if you have incoming data on a daily basis. That thing has to be handled with care.
6.	And can be done using magical thing like cpanel. Now, believe me, some poor soul that you pay for it will be delighted finding out that you do have cpanel. He will fall in love with you for that.
7.	Because cpanel not only handles all files on the server like it is a part of your computer, based on your hosting). Then, it handles all your site databases, and give you powerful tools to repair them, rewrite, all. Then, there is security area that will keep your site safe as possible (keep in mind – every site can be hacked). There is also backup engine. Next, amount on info you can get thru awstats is enormous. You don’t need google to do it for you. But from SEO reasons it is good to be connected with google and their webmaster tools. Also, portals
8.	Your final choice of hosting will consist of the info you collect on several parameters like – server disk space, location, support, cpanel, and after all – price. Don’t be cheap here, especially if you expect your business to be dependent of the internet presence. I have my sites running on some 40-50 $ yearly, and you can find it if you try. Be suspicious and demanding. Don’t fall for the trick that it is important to put a lot of money into the design; best design on lousy server is a waste of money. Best design with lousy product/service – also. I mean, is that a design? But millions of happy people are here every day. Content rocks
9.	I didn’t mention domain picking process: whatever you do guys – be short, but also your niche. Combine that in 7-12 letters (or less) and you are good. Also, com, org, net and other discussions last as long as the internet – basically they are all the same.
10.	My last point will be this: trust the experts, SEO (search engine optimization) or web design. Usually, big promises and chosen words (keywords, hehe) lead nowhere; you don't want to spend huge amounts of that green stuff (they call it money) in vain. Best cure for that is: YOU know your company, your venture, therefore you must know your target market, and you are supposed to ask yourself a million questions about your business strategies. Know that internet is not a magic wand – things are far more complicated than you think. At the core of all designs, marketing tricks
11.	One more – website has to be frequently updated. Never lose control of it, and pay endlessly for each change. You know, guys that cover things with their fancy professional slang. If you solve this one, after you managed to set up other things mentioned here – then you are on the net. That is the day you start, really...

I was looking to get some input from those who have worked with them or started their own business in this industry.  Since I don't have much money I'm going to get [DIY Prusa Mendel Kit](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel) and work off one and see how the market works out.  I plan on documenting the process and making internet videos on the process so other entrepreneurs in other parts of the country can learn how to do this.

Update: 

I live in Alaska which make internet shopping a way of life but if I can print for local crafters they will be able to order more items while cutting down on shipping costs.  Tourism is big up here and a lot of local crafters make items on the side to sell off and make some money.  So I'm not expecting to have bulk orders for stuff but will be getting orders of like 3 to 10 items at a time.  This can save local crafters time as they don't have to carve the stuff themselves and they will be able to focus on the finishing touches.

For those of who are wondering on the legalities of printing firearms stuff my state has very lax gun manufacturing laws and the main laws that are of concern are the federal ones.  I plan on printing firearms accessories like custom pistol grips.  For those who would be interested in actually printing federally regulated stuff you can lease the machine time to the person and sell them the material to make the part.  You will need a class 3 firearms license in order to manufacture firearms for sell.  There is also multiple types of licenses once you get to class 3 so you will need to do your research in order to go this route.  I don't plan on doing this unless I get a very strong interest after the initial set-up.  It cost a couple thousands of dollars just to apply and more to insure your location complies with the requirements to have the license.
