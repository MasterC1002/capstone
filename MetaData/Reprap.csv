Ok, no big deal.  The next message from the user is quite troubling though: 

&gt; I received an email in which the owner said he was going to speak 
&gt; with a lawyer about a ""a potential defamation case"".  As a 
&gt; reasonable person
&gt; but I honestly don't feel I said or did anything slanderous or 
&gt; contrary to the truth.  I simply posted pictures of the parts I 
&gt; received.  I even mentioned positives such as the universal y-axis 
&gt; table quality. The thread was simply started to ask whether or not
&gt; I received printed parts that were
&gt; DIY 3D printer enthusiasts
&gt; would disagree with that.   I'm just a newbie trying to build my first 
&gt; 3D printer.  That said
&gt; removed all images in haste.  In the age of review websites such 
&gt; as Yelp and Amazon
&gt; a suit case like this would even get filed
&gt;
&gt;That said
&gt; thread as to avoid any potential legal actions taken against me.

There is a post on the [Terawatt Blog](http://blog.terawattindustries.com/2013/03/19/mendelmax-1-5-parts-quality/) which tries to explain that the quality of reprap parts is hard to obtain using cheap repraps. Somehow the parts I bought from a commercial seller were of excellent quality (nothing warped

The complete thread is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mendelmax/Yrox64RHdSQ).  Unfortunately some of the posts have been removed because of the scare tactics from Terawatt.

I've been teaching myself Blender 3D for the past couple of years and understand the basics of building 3D models.  I was looking at the Makerbot for a while

I was hoping I could get some advice about the pitfalls to avoid and any insights about the build process from people who have already built their own reprap.

I just started www.MakerJuice.com to produce awesome resin at a more affordable price. Right now I am selling on my site for $45/Liter for my first resin. That's a 40% savings over the next closest guys

My hope is with lower cost resin, and you can find me in #reprap if you want to talk!

I had a play around using Dichloromethane to smooth out the PLA post print.

The print was OK to begin with - took a while to clean up as it was covered in support and my retract settings were not perfect - which lead me to have a play with dipping the model in Dichlo.

Hopefully the results speak for themselves! He has lost his brightness

Bear in mind that the Dichlo is crazy bad for you and everyone around you - and all H&amp;S precautions should be taken if using the chemical! :)

I recently decided to tackle building my own machine and started browsing the various RepRap versions. I was watching a video of a 3D printer in action when this moment of inspiration hit me!

See - I work for a copier dealer. We sell big commercial equipment that runs at high speed with heavy paper stock and is designed to run for well over a million pages. It occured to me that the system that moves the light bar in our copiers is VERY similar to the parts needed for the X/Y axis on a 3D printer like the cartesio. These light bars have to move with the same kind of accuracy as a 3D print head in order to scan at high resolution. I feel like there's a possibility to build a pretty large machine as some of our scanning beds are as large as 12""x18"". And that's just the axis drive! These machines are packed with stepper motors, thermistors, timing controllers, miles of wiring, lots of fancy little connectors, bearings/rollers and of course a big touch screen display wouldn't be a bad thing right?

My boss gave me the ok to pull a couple of our old machines off to a corner in the warehouse and use them for scavenging purposes so I'm starting to work on figuring out what will actually be usable and planning my build. I'm curious if anyone has any experience with this type of scenario. Have you ever pulled parts from a copier? Any recommendations on firmware/controller hardware?

1. There's a ton of 3d printers out there.
2. There's a ton of technologies out there.

So, or wants a 3d printer.  And I want to know:
1. Why?
2. Who are you?

Why -- I guess this is, ' I really want something made in America'; Other factors -- e.g. 'You haven't thought of X.  I want X.')

Who are you -- Age, interests -- my blog stats and make faire experience shows me some of this.  Male, either near college aged or middle aged, with above average intelligence and a strong desire to be on the cutting edge of tech seems to be the norm of who I meet.  I'd love to hear from people who don't normally talk to me.  When I worked a booth at Maker Faire, I noticed that few women stopped by, but lots of machinists and engineering students.  MakerBot had a larger demographic -- so I'm really interested in understanding why.

I guess other questions I have are, when, how often"".  For example, where -- 'I run my printer in the Garage, since the Wife thinks it's too big for the house.'

How/when-'I use it on a Mac overnight

How often -- 'I print every day!'.

I could use a survey monkey and provide radio button options -- but I really want to hear, please upvote them.  This gives me some sense of how many people feel the same way.

I am considering getting a 3d printer for making small prototype parts at work.  I have been digging around the reprap wiki and talking to some folks on the irc channel and they recommend that a Kit is best for the first foray into the field.

I am currently looking at:

Makerbot Replicator
Ultimaker

I was completely blown away by how easy the Sketchup process was. I'm running Ubuntu, and finding / install the STL converter took longer than the modelling itself. 

I'm very pleased to finally have used the printer for the purpose I wanted it - to make parts for various electro / software projects I'm working on. It really feels like I've turned a corner this weekend. I've pulled various models off thingverse to augment my printer / make ""something"". But this is a step change for me. Its not beautiful

I've been experimenting a bit with large heated print beds.  So far, and around 12""x12"" in size.  This stuff is probably about .3mm in flatness, +-.

I've looked at Borosilicate glass -- it's about $50 for a 1/8"" thick 12""x12"" plate.  It's also got an error of +- 0.2mm ( so 0.4mm from peak to valley ).  

+-0.2mm is too much error -- I use a really thin nozzle

It makes keeping good bonds a pain in the ass right now.

I'm looking for a good way to get a good printing bond for less than $50.  I've also thought about creating electronics -- a proximity sonar sensor, I haven't solved the problem.  A touch probe is out -- too expensive as far as I can tell.

Anyone got any thoughts on how to solve this problem?  I'd really like ""fire and forget"" prints working.  Maybe something that's not too hard to remove when done?

I have a few things I need help with though:

a) I need a program or app with which I can use PHP to talk to the RAMPS controller. I know quite a bit of PHP so this is the easiest for me.

also


b) what controls should I add to the interface

however i did think of something else: this might be better suited for an RP programmer but I might use somthing like the following:

pin 1 = A

pin 2 = B

pin 3 = C

pin 4 = D

pin 1&amp;2 = E

pin 1&amp;3 = F

pin 1&amp;4 = G

pin 2&amp;3 = H .. etcetera.

Im thinking of having at least 5 buttons: +, back and reset.

The headless part of this would be programmed like this: Every setting is diplayed on the top line with the value on the bottom line so:

    Extruder *C
    230 *C

pressing + or - will set the higher or lower temp and pressing next or back will change which settings are changed.

the different options I want to be able to be changed are:

X speed (+ makes the axis move gradually faster to the right

Y speed

Z speed

Extruder speed

Extruder temp

bed temp

gcode file select (+ changes

Home (+ &amp; - do home)

Power (+ = reset


any suggestions for other functions?

The main thing I want to know is if there is a REALLY simple console program just to connect to the reprap and send/receive gcode.

I will keep you guys posted with more info about my progress.

1346171163.0,yyumu,Which Reprap to build for best print quality?,Dax420,13,1,35,"So I've been following the reprap stuff for a while and finally decided to build one of my own. I'd like to get the best quality prints possible so I'm going to skip the Prusa

I've narrowed it down to 3 repraps that I'm interested in:     

**Mendel90:** This is a good option in terms of a strong rigid frame that is easy enough to build. Not bad looking. I'd expect to produce some good quality prints with such a rigid frame.     

**Rostock Delta:** I just love the way this thing looks. Delta geometry is simply a whole new world of Cartesian location that I'm very interested in seeing developed. However I have some serious concerns about print quality. It's going to be very hard to eliminate backlash on those long spindly arms. This design is also too new for there to be enough first hand usage data for me. I'm not seriously considering building this reprap

**Tantillus:** I'm seriously considering going with a Tantillus. The guy who designed it and is producing kits lives about 10 minutes from my house, really brilliant, however I'm concerned that the monofilament  drive ""belt"" that he uses is going to eat itself apart being wrapped 5 times around the shaft like that. Replacing those monofilament lines is going to be a pain in the ass. I am also concerned about slippage since the grip on the shaft is ""friction"" and not a toothed belt. This is what gives them such high resolution and low back-lash, but I'm concerned it could also be problematic as the belt wears. Secondly the design is so new there is not a lot of real-world usage. People have gotten their kits in the mail by this point and are building away, but it's going to be some time before we see printers that have printed a few pounds of plastic and users who can give it a fair assessment.     

So I don't know if I should go with the tried and tested Mendel90, effort and money on building a printer.

* Is the lower bound of printing size limited by the print head or by the software? What is this lower bound typically found to be?
* With a novice level of understanding electronics but a high level of understanding of software and programming
* How fragile are the constructed pieces? Is it directly related to the stock material used or is it weakened by the means of creation?
* Say you were printing a 1 inch solid cube
* How easy is it to repair if the device malfunctions or breaks?
* And what are the minimum specifications to have for the computer that the device is hooked up to? Could an old desktop be used to run the software

Basically, but would it be better to buy a kit just so I don't have to worry about my own stupidity and shipping costs from multiple different places?

I've walked myself through the assembly page twice now, I'm not much of a stranger to programming either, and I've been vastly improving my 3D design skills to actually make my own schemas, I've been reading up everywhere, learning everything I can, and I think I'm confident enough to actually start this.

So

* Does $600 sound about right for the total costs of a Prusa Mendel Bill of Material?

2) Flipping the bed so that the warning text is facing down - Seemed to make a slight difference in that things stuck a little longer

3) Blue painter's tape - This was the solution for me.  As noted by peepsalot this completely changed my problem so that now my issue is getting things off the bed, also dirt cheap to implement.

I am currently trying to decide between printrbot+, I do not currently have a 3d printer, otherwise I would likely print out the mendelmax parts which are currently unavailable to buy from what I gather. I previously decided against the original printrbot because of the smaller build area. I don't think I would have any trouble putting any of these machines together. For me, it's more a matter of having to source all of the parts, making sure they're all compatible / I don't get the wrong thing, etc. The floating y-axis on the printrbot+ sort of scares me a bit. Will that contribute to lower quality prints? Quality is of high priority for me.

A little bit about my machine:
Prusa i2 with ABS parts
Ramps 1.4
Marlin Firmware
SAE
3 mm PLA Filament
.35 mm J head hot end
printing onto an 8*10 picture frame I had lol

And my slic3r settings:
Temp: 200 with 210 first layer
Print speed of 30 with +- 10 for small perimeters and infill
Layer height: .2 mm and a .5 ratio for first layer height


Problems:

* Tools - I'm not a handy man... and calling my tool selection thin is generous.  I had to buy calipers, using a wrench for crimpers... which I then had to go back and just solder after it broke.

* Building -  Cracked a linear bearing holder but it managed to stay so far

* Calibration.  I'm using a mechanical end stops and I swear it never is in the exact same place twice for the z axis.  I have to scrap about 2 out of 3 of my first prints because that all important first layer doesn't get put down correctly. When I finally do get it situated right

* Smooth Rods - my smooth rods are already developing some gouges in them where I guess the linear bearings are tearing into them.  I think I'm gonna have to replace both the rods and the linear bearings with some higher quality ones.

* ~~Y endstop~~ **Fixed**-  all my other endstops work fine

* The top layers would kind of drift off the base of my print

* The small Gear  -**4/11 biggest problem, due to before mentioned calibration issues, it turned out deformed. The nut inside this deformed gear just spun instead of tightening on the stepper motor shaft, so I tried turning the large gear by hand trying to print a new one with predictable results. Desperate, I took a lighter and essentially melted the bolt in place. This worked just long enough to print a very good looking small gear. However, now the stepper motor shaft just spins inside the new gear once it gets hot... (The grub screw is in place... had that problem before already too :-P) I'm thinking about taking off this gear and squirting some glue in it. Any reason not to do that?

It's been really interesting to work on, or encouragement are more than appreciated!

Pics of the first two cubes here, then things seem to get a little squirrelly.

I'm going to keep digging through the forums but I'm open to advice.

EDIT: also I was printing white ultimaker PLA at 190º

UPDATE: after the helpful comments and some more internet reading it looks like I'm just having a problem with heat because the layers don't have time to cool and the thin walls can be finicky too.  I did the same cube with infill as the next test in the calibration and it came out great.  Maybe just a tiny bit of wobble in my z axis which is strange since I'm using the metal couplings and precision lead screws

Still going to tune my extruder steps and make sure my filament size is correct to see if that gets me even better prints.

about 45 minutes into a 90 minute print the machine stops acking and stops sending temperature updates.  Attempts to send commands to the RAMPS board are not ack'd in any way.  I can disconnect and reconnect to the machine but then I have to start the print from the beginning.

Edit: it doesn't stop at the same place every time.  Sometimes it makes it successfully through a whole print.  It's the randomness that makes this especially weird.

What am I doing wrong?  Is there a way to resume mid print?

I've noticed the number of folks just about to start building Prusa's

I designed this after getting frustrated with the complexity of my Prusa.    All axes of motion have been built at this time

Here are some of the features that I think people will like:

Tool head changes are super easy -- just change a screw ow two

It's very flexible a design -- you can add Z stages

It's also a very fast build.  Alpha-1 build started @ 3:00 on Saturday

Current print area matches a Prusa

I currently believe Alpha-1 of the bot will be complete soon -- probably in a week or two, and I'd love to get backers a that time.

This is a part bloggy thing

I've been getting OK results in PLA testing (cubes and couple of simple shapes)

Having completely messed up the filament change (resulting in a small blob snapping off the thread

Stripped down

* Hex head bolts, so now I can just hold the hex head bolt with needle nose pliers and spin the wingnut off. When she's fully up and running (ha!) I'll super glue the threads to fix the wings nuts in place. 

* remove the excess main bolt in the extruder. Its fixed on with a nyloc nut

* Address the 2 retaining screws between the hotend and the extruder. This is a really weak link in my build, so every time there is a block / issue, the whole gear has to come off. I've re-cut the driver slot for now, and flatten off a couple of sides. The idea is that I can grip the heads behind the main cog and get the off without having to remove the extruder main bolt. I drove all over town looking for M3 35mm hex head bolts with no joy. I have another store I can try tomorrow, but essentially I hit every hardware store in a 40km radius from me, and found nothing suitable. This design should have a captive hole for the retaining bolts. There is plenty of plastic here, and it would make removal of the hotead much much easier. 

* Still on the hotend/extruder coupling. I filed out the holes in the extruder and filed off the groove in the hotend, the bolts slide in place, and rely on the bolt pinching to hold in place, not the pseudo thread being tapped by the snug-fit bolt.  

OK - on the main question. 

I assembled the extruder off the printer and wanted to observe the extrusion of any filament. Having hooked the idler back up to the main body

I have tried to make a hobbed bolt - but I can see its not ideal. I basically cut out slots in the smooth shaft of the bolt - I don't access to a proper shop

As you can see form the pictures

So my main question is. what should i do about this? I'm very reluctant to start filing off the idler block - without it

Pictures (apols for cellphone quality):

I started building my own 3D printer about 2 weeks ago. Well

The first thing I noticed is that there is a general lack of really concise information out there in regards to designing and building your own printer. Maybe this is just because it is not that common? I don't know really.

I currently own a whole f-ton of domains, just somewhere for me to get information on a page and not have it look like a piece of garbage.

That basically brings me here
What I'm wondering is if anyone on here would be willing to trade some of the expertise I have


Things I'm looking for:

Someone who has a thorough (See: better than my) understanding of electronic circuit design.

Someone who has web-dev experience.


Things I can offer:

CAD work. I use Solidworks.

Mechanical design/engineering.

Non-stamped fabrication drawings.

Printed parts at cost. (Either 16 micron polyjet parts

Manufactured parts. (Lathed



What got me going down this road was I recently had a fellow redditor offer up some electronics help with a SLS laser setup in exchange for help with his mechanical design.

1361883050.0,1998pa,Missed steps...,jwarp,4,1,12,"So i finished assembly on my prusa (kit from makerfarm) over the weekend and have been able to successfully print a number of calibration objects.  I followed a calibration guide and got it printing very nicely for a newb IMO.

I am having an issue now when trying to print a larger print (an arduino mega mount).  Twice now it has missed steps on the X axis and shifted over about 35mm when it was 25% of the way through.  Axis feels smooth/no binding. Just for fun on the 3rd try I rotated the part 90 degrees in slic3r and interestingly after it made it to 75% it then shifted on the Y axis.  

I was thinking it was a heat issue... My motors seem to be fairly hot (I can hold my hand on them for about 3 seconds before I remove it)

When I get home I am going to recheck everything and try again.  Could it be a slicing problem since the shift switched axis when I rotated the part?  The graph display in pronterface doesn't show any shifted layers though.  Let me know if you guys have any ideas.  

****EDIT: Thanks guys... got it to print successfully. Slightly turned down the driver pots and slightly reduced both accel and max speed.  Now have a nice mount for the board and can finish assembly! ",self,t5_2qq91,1361926424.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/1998pa/missed_steps/

I want the printer to produce extremely fine prints, 0.2mm and 0.3mm. Can I configure that via the controller myself or should i request that from the controller people?

ABS, there are companies that use HDPE and they have a lot of waste left over - why not extrude that myself and keep my machine running longer :)

My setup:

1) RepRap Prusa Mendal from makerfarm
2) Printrboard revD
3) PronterFace
4) Slic3r 0.9.9

The problem seems to have started happening when I switched to another PLA filament because I ran out of my first roll of PLA. They were both bought from http://www.onlinefilament.com/

I noticed one thing

So the issue here is that, the heat seems to be travelling too fast up the filament and causing the rigidity of the filament to fall, therefore when it gets pushed, the filament just bends and jams. 

So I set my solid infill speeds higher, my stream of filament turns into dribbles intermittently after a couple layers, or after a couple dozen layers. So here are the things I've tried:

1) I thought maybe the retraction was too fast therefore causing the extruder to lose grip of the filament
2) Change the layer heights from 0.15 to 0.2
3) I thought maybe the tightness of the screws that push the filament on the hobbed bolt was the issue

I've used quite a bit of the filament trying to print out one part

1. Using ethernet cables to drive the stepper motors.
2. Underestanding print quality variances.

For 1:
I used these these ethernet breakout boards from simplehomenet.com and wired up some connectors for RAMPS to these breakout boards.  I'm testing a hypothesis that Ethernet will work just fine for motors.
It worked!  But after 2 minutes, everything just worked -- no crashes.  What could be causing this?  I did this only on the Extruder, not the other motors.  So, I left the Hot end wired into the ethernet cable, and wired the stepper motor separately.  This worked fine.  How can I fix this -- and why does the stepper motor cause a failure after running a few minutes?

For 2:
I print using a J-Head hot end, the results change.  I think my filament is absorbing water.  The prints become cloudy, and these strange, ""hard peaks"" appear on the surface of whatever I've printed.  I Live in Seattle, and our humidity is 100% every day, pretty much.  It really does rain every day here.  But I don't expect this much change in print quality from water.  Is this really just water, or is there something else that can cause this?  Also -- How does ABS print quality hold up over time vs PLA?  I use PLA only right now

The reprap wiki seems to be lacking anything that specifically goes part per part down a list of what I need to build one. Things like how to build an extruder seem to be missing

How do people generally power their printers? It seems like a pc power supply is complete overkill but I've seen somewhere that people were using those.

Thanks you guys.

The base perimeter prints fine

I've tried adjusting # of perimeters, filament extrusion speed/size, speed settings for infill and perimeters... everything.. I just can't print a .1 object

what settings are the best?

I'm getting near the end of the mechanical assembly portion, especially with the diagram on reprap.org, but I've seen so many different versions of programs and firmware and stuff that I'm not so well versed in, so I was looking for some help.

So, at least)? What do I need to install? How can I test that everything works before I try a real print?
