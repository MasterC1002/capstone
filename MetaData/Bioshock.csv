1364407200.0,1b4fmx,My detailed ending explanation. My attempt at the most accurate ending explanation/discussion. [Ultimate Spoilers],Jusicarchon,1434,230,957,"1. A young Booker participates in the massacre at Wounded Knee and is tramautized by the experience.

2. Booker considers baptism as a means of escaping his sin. In one universe (b) Booker refuses
The crucial split occurs here. Comstock and Booker both reflect on their actions at Wounded Knee (though nobody remembers Comstock being there since he assumed a new identity

3b. Without Christianity to ""absolve"" him

4b. Despite his ugly state, drinking, and gambling. The debt piles up quickly and the collectors demand payment. Booker is unable to pay and likely to be killed.

5b. Only one man is willing to settle Booker's debt.  It is the male Lutece. He seeks an opportunity to join the female version of himself in Columbia and assisting Comstock in obtaining a genetic daughter (to fulfill the prophecy) appears to be the only way to do so. He conspires with his quantum ""twin"" and Comstock to obtain Booker's daughter

6b. ""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt."" In a moment of weakness

7b. Booker carves his daughter's initials into his hand as penance for his latest sin. He spends many years riddled by guilt

~~~

3c. As a born-again Christian

4c. Columbia is created and Comstock leads Columbia as American's ""finest city"". However

5c. Now in a heated tension with the US

6c. Lutece has been using  her quantum discoveries to open keep the city afloat and to open rifts to other universes. These experiments have rendered Comstock sterile and he is unable to conceive the ""prophecy child"" with Lady Comstock. He turns to Lutece to find a solution. Female Lutece has been opening rifts and believes she has a solution. Perhaps as a form of ""wish fulfillment""

7c. Comstock and male Lutece bring Anna to Columbia. Lady Comstock suspects adultery. Comstock declares this a ""miracle"" child that was conceived in just one week and christen the child ""Elizabeth"". Comstock has his wife and the Lutece's killed at some later point in order to secure the secret of his child. Anna is gifted with tremendous power and sealed away until she can be bent to her father's will. 

8c. Nealy 20 years pass. The Lutece ""twins"", or fearing for the future that will occur as a result of Elizabeth remaining in Comstock's custody (burning of New York, presumed end of the world), or maybe simply recognizing that Elizabeth's rifts are the universe's way of expressing that Elizabeth doesn't belong in this universe (due to the severed finger remaining in Booker's universe) - the male Lutece has demanded that Elizabeth be returned home. 

9c. Elizabeth is sealed away however and her powers are siphoned. The ""twins"" decide that the only way to bring Elizabeth home is to close the ""infinite loop"" that has been created by Comstock taking Booker's daughter. Only Elizabeth has the power to reach the place where the loop was created and Booker will ultimately be needed for the closure. So, and new ones are created to make sense of the world and his new mission. Booker draws on the traumatic memory of losing his daughter to create these new memories whereby the Pinkertons have tasked him to return Elizabeth to New York. ""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.""

10c. Booker comes to Columbia and ultimately rescues Elizabeth from her fate as the ""next Comstock"" that will bring about the end of the world. However, the city, and Songbird. The only way to close the loop is to stop the Booker/Comstock divergence from occurring. Elizabeth figures this out and some of her ""infinite"" copies join her to emphasize the problem and they join to drown Booker during the baptism to ensure that the infinite loop is closed. 

11b/c. Booker dies in the water at his baptism. Therefore he never has a child and Comstock never rises. The infinite cities all cease to exist. The post-credit scene implies that with the infinite loop closed, something that clearly cannot happen now. The best explanation for this scene is that up until the baptism all the Comstock and Booker universes always existed and were completely identical until the relevant choice that defines them. This fits were the ""always existing"" theme of alternate universes that allows us to explore the alternate realities of Chen Lin and is reinforced by comments from the Luteces. This speculative theory suggests that Booker was killed in the universe where he accepts the baptism (which in turn hosts an infinite number of other universes following that city, all with the theme of one man-one city-girl-song bord) and thus by closing that universe, all Comstocks cease to exist. The ""non baptism"" universe and all its derivatives remain intact and hence we see Booker back in his office after the credits. Now there can be no interference from the ""Comstock universes"" and thus at least in one universe he will be with his daughter. 


Remaining big questions:

1- The prophecy was actually correct. Comstock said it was delivered by an archangel. What really happened? Who actually tipped off Comstock that someone with ""AD"" on their hand would be coming to retrieve Elizabeth? The only possibility is that female Lutece never wanted to leave her twin (they would be seperated for eternity if the loop was closed) and therefore she arranged for ""visions"" and ""prophecies"" to appear for Comstock in order to ensure that their universe remain intact and uninterupted - no matter how bad it got for anyone else. Since her brother wanted the loop closed

2- The Bioshock link. The story makes it clear that Bioshock/Rapture/Ryan/Little Sisters/Big Daddies were just another ""infinite variable"" of Columbia/Comstock/Elizabeth/Song Bird. This is troubling since it implies that the entire Bioshock story was just another derivative of the current story

Edit: Made a few slight changes and expanded on #11 to explain the ending. I'm also adding this tantalizing tidbit from Bioshock indicating that Andrew Ryan is related to Comstock in a universe that plays out with different ""variables"":

    The following points are simply my thoughts on the ending. If other people have alternate explanations
    please post them and I will link to them here.

**What are Constants and Variables?**

    ""Happen
        Robert Lutece

This is honestly a hard thing to describe as we are not privy to the entire set of time/dimension traveling rules in this game. However

The Lutece twins speak of constants and variables. In short, or certain events will always play out in a certain way. They experimented this with the [coin toss experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTAXzCByaVs), where Booker will always flip the coin heads, as he has done 122 times previously. They also demonstrated the inevitability of certain events. In the beginning of the game, [Booker receives a telegram to not choose #77](http://youtu.be/t33NMoZeXO4?t=1m40s). However, during the raffle, Booker will always pick #77

So, who grows in power and creates Columbia thanks to the efforts of Lutece. However, his repeated experiments with tears has rendered him infertile and caused other debilitating side effects. Thus, Comstock planned to steal Anna, Booker DeWitt's daughter from the other world, in order to continue his dream to create the Lamb. However, once this occurs, in one of their tear experiments, they seemed to have been [scattered across the possibility space](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/A_Theory_On_Our_%22Death%22). However

Thus, prompting curiosity from the Lutece twins. They continued this over and over, observing each Booker that they encounter, noting of certain constants and variables that occur whether or not Booker actually succeeds in saving Elizabeth in that timeline. [One constant they realize is that there will be an infinite number of timelines with Comstock in it, thus Booker will always lose his child in every timeline.](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/What%27s_Done_is_Done) Even if Booker does succeed in one timeline, in another he is unable to stop Comstock. This is the universal Constant, that no matter how many times they repeat this, happened

The only way to do that is to find the Booker who would realize the existence of this Constant and end it before it all begins. And

**Why does Booker have to die?**

    ""Booker
        Elizabeth

The idea behind the multiverse is the idea that for every decision that is made, Booker decides to either refuse the baptism, upon which he remains Booker DeWitt, or accepts it, upon which he becomes Zachary Hale Comstock. Now, while it is clear that there are two distinct characters that emerge from this event, what about the Booker right before the choice is made? This Booker can be considered to be simultaneously Booker and Comstock until his decision is made. This idea stems from the principle of the [Shrodinger's Cat thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).

Booker, and there are two possible outcomes: one in which he refuses the baptism and remains Booker DeWitt, and the other in which he accepts the baptism and becomes Zachary Hale Comstock.

*KILLING THE BOOKER WHO ACCEPTS THE BAPTISM WILL NOT END THE PROBLEM*. As soon as a decision is made, and [this is where the mutliverse Elizabeths drown him](http://youtu.be/F-VJ3j2bPJk?t=14m41s). This can only be possible when Booker realizes the existence of this loop and accepts his death.

**But the Booker we played was the one that was drowned...right?**

    ""The mind of the subject will desperately struggle to create memories where none exist...""
        Rosalind Lutece

So, as well as some other people. Whenever this happens, it is indicated by dizziness and bleeding from the nose. It's hard to draw a conclusion when only Booker, Chen Lin, and the guards having been affected, but I'll do my best. 

Whenever Elizabeth opens a tear, bringing with her people around her in a small radius. We can see this shown when [Fink's Head of Security is unaffected](http://youtu.be/IDx35AtYWUQ?t=29s), despite being dead in the first timeline. Whenever a tear is opened and the people step through, the mind will attempt to settle paradoxes by rewriting memories.

The first paradox we see is the state of being alive or dead, Lady Comstock, and two guards. What happens here is that the memories of the dead and the living are in conflict with each other, so the mind will attempt to combine memories of death with life. The effects of this seem to vary in intensity and results. A common ailment is that people will end up feeling traumatized and deeply disoriented, often seen struggling with their deaths. A possibly more intense reaction is the formation of new abilities, although Lady Comstock's situation is a bit special as [1) Elizabeth's powers were forced by the Siphon and 2) the Lady Comstock brought over is the one that encompasses the traits that Elizabeth imagined her to have](http://youtu.be/hB8tUKDbYd8?t=3m32s). 

Booker's situation is a special case as he is actually stepping into another universe. Thus the memories that merge will collect in his mind, the mind does not have to rewrite his memories. *This idea is tenuous at best, and could simply be the result of an oversight by the developers unless someone can explain this better.*

The second paradox is the state of existing or not existing in the timeline, muddling his memories to fit within this new universe. [Robert Lutece also experiences this as well](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/One_and_the_Same) when he crosses over to meet his sister. This is a type of paradox where the memories of the same people will *not* merge.

Why is it the second paradox people will merge, so their memories will merge. However, Booker, Comstock, Rosalind, and Robert are largely unaffected by the paradox of being in two places at once, with some minor hemorrhaging on the side of Booker and Robert. This may be due to the fact that there is enough of a difference between them that the universe allows them to exist simultaneously. In the case of the Lutece twins, where combining them would probably induce another paradox of being both male and female. For Booker and Comstock

So, as the origin of Elizabeth's powers is simply explained with a hand wave of [being in two places at once](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/The_Source_of_her_Power), and the game doesn't delve deeply into this.

So, Elizabeth has the ability to open any tear she wants and can access the infinite doors that lead to different timelines. So, when Booker steps through, he is essentially going back and time, his own self is reverted to that time period's Booker. This can be seen when you accept Preacher Witting's hand for baptism, [Booker's own hand is young and has no AD or bandage wrapping around it](http://youtu.be/F-VJ3j2bPJk?t=7m41s). This signifies that Booker has merged with his younger self, starting again at the baptism scene. This points to the fact that the Booker that we play through and the Booker that is drowned by the Elizabeths are one and the same person.

**What does the scene post-credits mean?**

**Why did they end up in Rapture?**

Elizabeth needed a place to destroy Songbird, seen the first time he attacks you when you and Elizabeth crash into Battleship Bay.^[Venndicator](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bk21y/bioshock_infinite_the_ultimate_spoiler_faq/c97fsv9)

Another reason is to tie Columbia and Rapture thematically. Rapture, and the game *Bioshock* holds many similarities with *Bioshock Infinite*. This suggests that Rapture is an alternate dimension of Columbia. This is further exemplified when Elizabeth mentions ""There's always a lighthouse, there's always a city, there's always a man"", pointing to the main thematic similarities between both cities, and the overarching themes of the series and possible future iterations of the series.

An interesting tidbit is that Booker is able to operate the Bathysphere. In *Bioshock*

As well as reaction gifs we no longer want memes to be posted unless they are in a self post. We feel like there are a lot of nonquality memes being upvoted that contain no discussion in the comments. Some people are very blatantly using these types of posts as a way to get summa dat sweet sweet karma. **Meme posts that will be accepted in a link post and not a self post are ones in which the main picture comes directly from one of the bioshock games. For example, but I'm trying to outline a point)**

**Exhibit A:** Booker speaks Sioux (so we are told by Preston Downs

&gt;""Turns out, I'll let him hold the knife."" —Voxophone 53, Preston Downs

An unusual skill for a white, given Exhibit C, it's extremely unlikely.

**Exhibit B**: Booker/Comstock was particularly vicious at Wounded Knee. Not a big deal by itself

&gt;""DeWitt...we called him the White Injun of Wounded Knee

**Exhibit C:** The reason for his viciousness is that Booker was alienated by persistant rumors that he was partially of Native-American descent. As Comstock he would continue to be a racist asshole.

&gt;""In front of all the men, doesn't it, son?'* This lie, this calumny, had followed me all my life. From that day, no man truly called me comrade. It was only when I burnt the teepees with the squaws inside, did they take me as one of their own."" —Voxophone 61

So

Plagued by rumors that he was secretly an Indian, the young soldier, would never have tried to *learn* Sioux, to become a translator. That would only make the rumors worse. He didn't learn it in the army. 

Booker probably didn't go back to the Midwest to learn the language following the massacre (the Lakota, and was living in New York, riddled with guilt, addiction and debt.

Plus, if it even still existed (Comstock was baptized because of guilt over it, but would later celebrate it in the Hall of Heroes...) He didn't learn it in the army. He already spoke it well enough to interpret by the time he got to Columbia. So, he must have known it since he was a child.

What white man learns Sioux as a child

So, filling your city with white-supremacist/racial purity propaganda and being anti-miscegenation, you and your Lamb are both 'impure.' Fuck you, Booker.",,False,self,1365221671.0,t3_1brp1m

1364618170.0,1bacog,"ENDGAME SPOILERS: The ""good"" part about the ending of Bioshock Infinite",nabaker,376,41,375,"From what I've read in this sub

1. We all know about the two main universes: Universe A, Anna.

2. Both Comstock and B-Universe Booker are the bad guys. B-Booker

3. Lutece (both of them) regret their decision and want to give Booker another chance. When Lutece(s) take B-Booker and transplant him (several times, and is now what I like to call ""C-Booker"".

4. So here's how the ending is a ""good"" ending, he must also kill B-Booker (which he thinks is himself). He agrees with this. So when they drown Booker, it is not C-Booker that the Elizabeth's/Anna's drown, but Comstock/B-Booker.

5. The C-Booker is the one who chose neither to commit the actions of Comstock or B-Booker. This is why he is able to (presumably) ""return"" to his daughter in the after-credits scene. He has redeemed himself

_________________________________

This is the result of me racking my brain for the past day, and allows me to feel good about the ending. It is the only way I can rationalize the existence of the after-credits scene, which, in my mind, is all-important - everything that happened in the game must line up with the fact that Booker is alive at the end of the game, back in his office.

**EDIT:** Here's one reason why I think this is true: the Bioshock 1 connection. The first Bioshock was the story of a man who has been dealt a bad hand. Throughout the game, and acting on it in a way that there is a ""happy"" ending. In Bioshock 1, the happy ending is that the little sisters are rescued by and live with Jack until he dies peacefully. In Bioshock Infinite, the happy ending results from C-Booker choosing to neither be Comstock or the man who sold his daughter (B-Booker), and he drowns them both sacrificially. He is then ""re-born"" through the Elizabeths' baptism, to a point where he is both with his daughter and remembers the events of the game.",,self,,

I think in a lot of FPS games you're not supposed to think about the weight behind the act of shooting people. They try to give you justifiable reasons, Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War). I think the reason people feel uncomfortable with the incredible violence in BI is it's not supposed to be morally easy.

For instance the first cop you kill. Everything up to that point is idyllic (after you enter the city, he was threatened, but he drew first blood, like a natural killer. It symbolizes the fact that Booker is the monster. It's a shocking display of brutality. It forces you to see what a horrible and stark thing violence, and the sight of blood is, in a genre of game where it is so often trivialized. And Booker settles into the flow like it's an old friend, although with some reluctance. Like he tells Elizabeth later when she asks if he ever gets used to the killing, just like how Jack's lack of agency is a comment on our role as gamers in an authored experience.

When Elizabeth starts following you around and you're ambushed, and the game is really not trying to make you feel comfortable with the killing. We kill so many people in games, but rarely does a game challenge us to really think about what we are doing.

One of the most poignant scenes (MAJOR SPOILER) for me was the death of Comstock. It's the equivalent of Bioshock's Andrew Ryan encounter. That little space looks so idyllic, and the game never tries to make you feel justified about it.

So in short, on so many levels, the sinner beyond redemption, the source of all the evils in the game in one way or another. It's just not as simple as being the good guy with a just cause. We're just so used to not having to face what it means to fire guns at people.

Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have been playing games for so long, I have gotten to a point of ennui with games lately. I enjoy them, sure, and multiplayer is a lot of fun - but that's where I get my enjoyment. Storylines don't *mean* anything anymore. They're just tacked on explanation for the multiplayer. I'm not invested in the characters. I don't care whether they live or die, I just care that I blaze through the game so I can understand the setting. 

But this game - **this fucking game.** Oh no. It's not like the others. This one is special. Sure, I owe it to myself to play a Bioshock game finally, right? So I spent the $60. I installed the game. I started it up... and was caught off guard immediately. But nothing really amazing - sure it was beautiful and the writing was great, but it's still *just another game.*

Then, big blue eyes, delicate features, petite build. Just physically, from the moment you first see her, she catches your eye. And then she looks at you, and she says... ""Are you real?"" Are. You. Real. Just a simple question, so much so that when she sees another human

And it just goes on from there. The interplay between Booker and Elizabeth makes the game, so she could flip it to me with a ""Catch!"" and then I could hear Booker's ""Thanks!"" in return.

But to me, in gameplay, or in immersing the player - that if she was not absolutely flawless, the game would be just average. But she isn't. She's perfect. Irrational, you've done it. I fell in love with a character. *Finally.* I'm not one to get easily attached, and maybe that's part of the boredom I felt with games. But you did such an amazing job with Elizabeth, that I fell in love with her. The interaction between the player and Liz is so seamlessly put together that you really do genuinely care for her. I fell in love with her fidgets, and, like plot points. I couldn't change what happened, I needed her. When she finally changed her appearance

In the end, and maybe will ever see. This game, this story, this... utter masterpiece will go down in history, mark my words.

So thank you

He was not a nice dude. I don't think he himself would argue with you. But I wanted to point out some numbers based on the timeline.

This is based largely around the timeline found in the Hall of Heroes. Screenshots [here](http://i.imgur.com/5JtiNTw) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/Vask26B).


1874:

* **Booker is born**. We know the date is accurate and not edited by Comstock because it also appears on Booker's Pinkerton ID that shows up on the loading screens.

1890:

* **Battle of Wounded Knee. Booker is 15/16.** This is certainly not uncommon in this point in history

Somewhere between 1890-1893 (Booker/Comstock are 16-19):

* **Baptism.** Comstock takes the baptism, even given the circumstances. Comstock, on the other hand, wants to be absolved of responsibility—which is pretty in line with a lot of 16-19-year-olds I've known.

* **Comstock meets Rosalind, IIRC. So he's been looking 60+ since he was pre-20. 

* **Booker meets an unknown lady, you're, say, 17, just back from a war that's left you emotionally scarred. Religion isn't helping. You shack up with a woman, she gets knocked up, gives birth, and now you're a single dad at 18. 

* **Booker drinks and gambles.** A.k.a. ""The College Years.""

1893 (Booker/Comstock are 19/20):

* **Comstock launches Columbia.** Quite the overachiever. In modern times he'd be on the cover of Times or featured on one of those ""Top 25 Under 25"" lists. Unfortunately he looks like an old man

* **Comstock finds out he's sterile, completely broke, and generally unprepared to raise a child on his own, accepts.

* **Booker tries to back out of the deal, because it remains preserved enough for 20 years to give her powers of mastery over time and space.

Somewhere between 1893-1912 (Booker is 19-38):

* **Booker becomes a Pinkerton

Meanwhile

* **Comstock kills his wife to ensure the secret of Anna/Elizabeth's origin.**

Meanwhile

* **Comstock claims responsibility for squashing the Boxer Rebellion in China.** Slate claims Comstock wasn't there at all. Possibly Comstock used news of the rebellion and did some posturing for his own people

1909 (Booker/Comstock are 35). (Thanks to rallion for these dates!)

* **Sept 3 1909** The Luteces find out what Elizabeth eventually becomes and does. Robert feels guilty.

* **Oct 16 1909** Robert convinces Rosalind to help undo what they've done. She doesn't see the point

* **Nov 1 1909** The Luteces are ""dead

1912 pre-game (Booker/Comstock are 38):

* **The Luteces enact their plan.** They call up a Booker who has spent 20 years wallowing in guilt over the decision to give up his daughter. Remember

1912-on: 

* **Events of Bioshock: Infinite.**

Maybe it's just me, then spent a long time agonizing over these choices. Ultimately, when he had the opportunity to set things right, he took it.

1365792918.0,1c81qk,Why Songbird Really Matters (WARNING: SPOILERS),DoctorSteve03,251,33,116,"Expanding on a post /u/Appleseed_ made yesterday

Appleseed_ pointed out an interesting symbolic parallel between Booker

&gt; • Comstock: Died because he was drowned by Booker.

&gt; • Booker: Died because he was drowned by Elizabeth(s).

&gt; • Songbird: Died because he was ""drowned"" by Elizabeth.

Thinking more on the suspicion that Songbird might be another iteration of Booker

&gt; We know Booker is distraught about selling his daughter to Comstock, into joining him in Columbia as his daughter's ward. He'd have to make the sacrifice of becoming the Songbird, but he'd be guaranteed the opportunity to watch her grow up. Extend that a bit further, and there are three other possibilities: 1) Songbird Booker would inherently view protagonist Booker as a threat to his care-taking and redemption, so he'd automatically be inclined to stop protagonist Booker from stealing her away; 2) Comstock is able to sell his warped ideology to Songbird Booker to seal the deal, ensuring his unwavering defense of Elizabeth; or 3) Songbird Booker sees it as his sole responsibility to care for and/or save Elizabeth since he's the one who got her imprisoned in the first place.

There's a description somewhere around Finkton (I can't remember if it's on a chalkboard or a Voxophone) that describes how Fink had a damned hard time getting the bonding between Songbird/Elizabeth to work as effectively as it did for the Big Daddies/Little Sisters. He couldn't force the Songbird to care about Elizabeth unless there was an already-present connection between the two. Assuming Booker's aforementioned guilt after selling Anna (which seems reasonable considering he carved her initials into his hand), and so keen on giving her information about the outside world--perhaps knowingly, hoping that she'd eventually ""grow up"" and escape on her own, or unknowingly, thinking that giving her all kinds of books and gifts would make up for what a crappy father he'd been.

During the scene where Fink has Booker 'audition' for head of security, there's no bigger security job in Columbia than taking care of Elizabeth, right? What if one of the ""failed"" Bookers was convinced that Fink's proposal (i.e., to become the head of security/Songbird) was a wise decision? We don't find out what happens in that particular universe because we find Chen Lin dead in the basement, and Elizabeth moves us to an alternate reality where Chen Lin is still alive. Could the reality we left be the one where an earlier protagonist Booker stayed on and became the Songbird?

I can envision DLC or a sequel where we play through as Booker No. 3 or 4 and eventually become the Songbird

**TL;DR: [Songbird could be an alternate version of Booker convinced to protect Elizabeth from his other selves. Definitely leaves room for an awesome sequel or DLC.](/spoiler)**",self,t5_2shl2,1365793120.0,,robert,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1c81qk/why_songbird_really_matters_warning_spoilers/

While the choice bears no consequence on gameplay

Things get weird in the epilogue, her pendant reverts to your choice.

Last but not least

**Your Elizabeth does not follow you through the final door to the Baptism.** Perhaps even after all you've done, and thus survives the epilogue.

So it strikes me there hasn't been more speculation on why the 123rd try was ""the one.""

Here's my take. Feel free to expand or destruct in the comments section.

Okay, it reads."" Ring the book/scroll bell once; then the key twice; then the sword twice as well. 

(Others have pointed out

On my first play through, the note demonstrates a worldview (likely Levine's) that has formed the basis of the Bioshock universe:

One Scroll (One Book, as I will explain, one's self.)

+

Two Keys (Two ""Answers"" -- i.e.

EQUALS

Two Swords (War -- the two keys are irreconcilable. The people wielding them will fight to  affirm their ""answer"" or interpretation as the correct one).

We see this with Comstock and Fitzroy

We see this in the original game with Fontaine and Ryan

Essentially, among other things, condemnations of fundamentalism and radicalism -- both in society and in ourselves. Only by by having a ""third"" force or ""sword"" can we meet somewhere in the middle. Only then can society thrive, and only then can we be comfortable and content as individuals. That sword must take what it learns from both ""keys"" -- both ends of the spectrum -- to fight for and eventually become what is right and rational.

So how does this fit into the 123rd try?

1-2-3. One book. Two keys. Three swords.

Booker is that third ""sword."" 

Booker's quest is a story of a man getting caught in the middle of two radical viewpoints, murderous, scheming ""Prophet."" There is the Booker universe where he sells his own daughter to settle a debt. There are the Founders, with their top-down, oppressive caste system, and the Vox Populi, a fiendish bunch just as violent and horrible.

See where I'm going with this? The only way Booker can succeed -- the only way his story can end 'happily' -- is by fighting to find the middle, pour every bit of his existence into trying to fix what has gone wrong. Trying to do too much right or too much wrong will always end up in the latter.

None of it will work.

Unless...he is able to fight hard enough and use what he has learned from two different realities and perspectives to make a third, yet turns neither to the bible or the bottle, but inward instead. 

There's always a man. Always a lighthouse. Always a city. The conflict of Bioshock Infinite is the same battle we all fight, to make the right choice -- even when faced with an Infinite sea of possibilities.

The end of Bioshock: Infinite plays out in a series of rapid fire truths both justifying and negating the events of the game. As players, two sides to the same coin, one the player circles endlessly as they traverse the universes around Columbia. Near the end, the game seems to paint Booker as the hero of the story. It’s a natural jump that doesn’t take too much to conclude. He’s saved the girl from her cage, killed the two monsters that sought to trap her there, and brought her full circle from frightened little bookworm to wormhole creating omniscient god. In the ending, Booker accepts that he is both men (Booker DeWitt and Zachary Comstock) and chooses to let the omniscient Elizabeth(s) to drown him in all the universes where he chose to be baptized and create the new persona of Comstock. The poignant final scene shows us, the Elizabeth(s) blinking out of existence as, specifically Robert Lutece. As we come to learn in the ending

Rosalind Lutece describes her “brother” as someone who believes time can be shaped and molded: “… where he sees an empty page, Rosalind Lutece from another side universe. He and his counterpart work tirelessly to finally pull themselves together in Rosalind’s universe. Although it has some negative effects on Robert as Rosalind surmises: “You have been transfused brother, into a new reality, but your body rejects the cognitive dissonance through confusion and hemorrhage.” He helps Rosalind build Columbia with Comstock and, eventually, open a tear into another side dimension to assist Comstock in kidnapping his child from another world. Somewhere along the line, however, this does not kill them entirely – it turns them into beings able to traverse the multiverse. Little explanation is given to how this change occurred in the Lutece’s, they set about righting their wrong by entrapping Booker DeWitt into their universe.

It is unclear the true path of the Lutece’s through the multiple universes around Columbia or how many times they dragged a drunken Booker through a tear. During the ending sequence, that the Lutece’s have been acting out their plan in a variety of different ways and universes for a long time. That might explain why they speak in riddles and only appear to guide Booker along the path they want him to take, or perhaps the monumental task of fixing the wrongs in what Rosalind calls “more an ocean than a river” just made them exceptionally batty. What is clear throughout the games subtext is the fact that Robert and Rosalind Lutece would cease to exist after Columbia was wiped from the universe. The event that transpired to create them would never happen, as Comstock would never fund Rosalind in the first place. Robert still chooses to force his sister into fixing the error of their past with the full knowledge that he would lose his omniscience and her company. Rosalind states in one of her voxophone recordings: “My brother has presented me with an ultimatum: if we do not send the girl back from where we brought her, he and I must part.” It is the revelation of this self-sacrifice that turns Bioshock: Infinite on its head. While the player must stub their toes around the plot-lines and machinations of the game, Robert Lutece already knows the beginning, middle, the man he was always meant to be. He does this knowing he will cease to exist. Yet

Without Robert Lutece, himself, and his sister. He did so in full knowledge of his own destruction, yet selflessly sacrificed his own abilities for the greater good. Robert Lutece was the true hero in Bioshock: Infinite; a man behind, below, around, and on every side of the curtain willing to save the girl and wipe away his debt to the universe.",True,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bvfkn/the_hero_of_infinite_spoilers/

Not the ending itself, the moment I saw the city through that window and heard ""Hallelujah"", I had tears in my eyes. My friend sitting next to me had to ask me if I was okay. This game from start to finish hit me so hard emotionally, especially at the very end that I was left gasping and crying as my brain put together the pieces, and then I sat there for an hour on my couch in stunned silence.
 
Upon my hours of reeling over the story I realized that this game is really not just a game, and to know that Columbia is always waiting for me, fills my heart with a joy I hadn't in my life known. It sounds overdramatic, sure, but in all honesty there has been no emotional response greater than the one to this game for me. It still has me thinking and examining every aspect of it to this very moment, almost a full 24 hours after beating it.

1364917903.0,1biriv,*spoilers* A Small Compilation of all the little things I noticed * do not come until you beat the game*,howester,193,33,227,"***SPOILERS***** DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU BEAT THE GAME*** ill try to update but I'm only human ;~;

Obvious ones

* The girl at the turntill to the Lady Airship asks if Elizabeth is Annabelle, and Belle which is princess, which was what Elizabeth's character is modelled after a disney princess.

* please tell me everyone saw the guitar scene.

* When Elizabeth revives you (yes 1999 mode is a bitch) she uses an Adam Syringe from bioshock

* bioshock and bioshock infinite are parallels and inverses of each other
and you take a boat to the lighthouse and a rocket up.

* the songbird and vigors AND MUSIC were technology stolen from rapture

* the song sung by the church Unbroken circle... the lyrics.. god damnit ;( (also it's the first song you hear entering Columbia

* the song bird's eye glass will crack when you first drop into battleship bay.

* A Big Daddy is to the Little Sister as the Songbird is to the Lamb.

Less Obvious

* When going to take the shuttle to the Lady Airship, the guy selling the hotdog doesn't know the price for the hotdog etc etc.

* you can shoot the Lucete twins when they give you the shield potion and your bullets do something funky  try it out!

* at the final scene, and booker comments saying you arent... who are you?
... for some reason the one we all traveled with did not show at the scene...

* whenever you go into a booker memory relapse (the gray scenes)

* the lucete twins when you first talk to them on the boat comment on how booker doesn't row

* the lucete twins when they ask you to flip heads or tails are taking tabs on how many times booker has looped through this part of the story and if the coin is heads or tails

* when you're at the beach
""Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world. ""

* when at soldier's front or hall of heroes or somewhere

* whenever you go through a tear, but the death of slate (if you kill him) is constant.

* the preacher is the same god damn bastard everywhere

* oh and im not 100% sure about this but whenever you get to a place in the story where memories overlap (baptism 

* the singing slave you meeting during the vox populi revolution is singing 'fortunate son ' which you hear in the locker room area (?) through a red tear in the Fink's square

* when Elizabeth and Booker discuss about Columbia

* Audiphones made by Comstock allude to the ending plot twist


Stuff I missed/forgot :P

(chance4e)

* cameos of the bioshock 1 and 2 wrench

* Tear to paris had the original unpolished working title of Return of the Jedi

* barbershop quartet sings a beachboy songs 50 years before it became a hit.

(tightestofbuttholess)

* Lucete is the old french name for the Roman City of the city where Paris stands today.

(allthejacobs)

* Music was all stolen through tears by Albert

(Lillionaire)

&gt;On the subject on names, ""I am God’s daughter."" Anna means ""favour"", ""grace"", ""prayer"", ""God has favoured me.""
Zachary means ""remembered by God""
Comstock might refer to Anthony Comstock


A weird Hypothesis I made

* I think when at the end you see Booker back in the gray room, so before Booker made the deal.  

Misc.

* Bioshock Infinite was supposed to be the original Bioshock but Kevin Levine was unable to push the idea

(BrianChiou9)

* infinite takes place before bioshock 1 (by year)

Feel free to add more below or to argue with me ^:)

Idea came from this post : http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bi6th/i_love_imagining_how_annoyed_liz_must_have_been/


~~Some facts:~~

~~* It uses the same keyword as the cipher from Elizabeth's room.~~ 

~~* It's a Vigenere type of cipher.~~

~~* The keyword is still not identified. Easily doable I think.~~ 


Very good explanation: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1bjc8y/spoilers_i_solved_a_ciphertext_handed_to_you_in/c97hrzn

* I'm pretty sure : is used both as h

And here's the symbol to letter key I did. It only works for every cipher that has the keyword Elizabeth was using. Also some letters are missing:
