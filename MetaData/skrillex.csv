But I also get a lot of people telling me that ""Don't you hate 'Skrillex fans' who only know 1 or 2 songs by him?"".

The answer is no. I would not, some of them are out of arrogance, but the majority of people are new to the genre and the aggressiveness, the pointless aggressiveness towards newcomers of the genre is disgusting and in complete opposite movement of what Skrillex is trying to do by unifying people and bringing us together through music. 

If a person only likes or knows a song or two by Skrillex, and to go around saying that they like Skrillex because…… surprise! They do. 

It's not like being a fan of Skrillex is a particularly unique thing to be… the man himself has nearly 7 million likes on FaceBook. 

You don't have to have an 'ILL' tattoo or have the logo painted in your room; or wear Skrillex apparel; hell you don't even have to go to a Skrillex show. It's not a secret club

Is skrillex Leaving behind his old sound

This wasn’t what I was expecting from skrillex’s new EP I won’t lie, and was, confused as to what I was hearing. After SM&amp;NS I was hooked on skrillex’s signature sound, Bangarang was somewhat of a evolution of that sound, into a cleaner sexier form of his old style. The leaving EP feels to me like a sidestep from releases such as summit and goin’in (going down) and I mean that in the best possible way, now for a track by track.

The Reason:

Starting with a soft synth and voice sample, conjuring very similar feelings too going down in my mind, the song builds again, and at the second drop, you get such a down and hard beat it’s astounding. Although this song might not be at a typical skrill tempo, its one of my favourite songs he has made now.

Scary Dolly Dub:

Since this is a “dj tool” as proclaimed by the great man himself, so pretty much the drop. It is no secret that this track was made some time ago, probally at the SM&amp;NS time, and you get that feeling from this track which is great in my opinion. I’ve had the pleasure of hearing this live, and it’s a great track to just rock the fuck out too, classic skrill, start to finish.

Leaving:

This track is very interesting, but once you listen too it, you can pickout his tried and tested techniques. If I had to compare it to any other artist it would be koan sound, something similar to their remix of A Team. With the smooth bass, and creative drums loops, this song is so chill its amazing. This song goes so well with the album art in my opinion, as I could 100% see myself listening to this, with some not so great stuff on my mind


This EP feels like a more grown up skrillex, but with 100% commitment, it drives forward, at a relaxed tempo. SBD, feels like a reflection too the past, letting us fans know that although we are experiencing an altogether more grown up sound, that old

I like this new progression skrillex has taken, i want more of this, mixed with the occasional banger

I have noticed a lot of hate towards him, him leaving an older band, etc. I love what he does, gets me pumped, who gives a shit if its some dubstep, mixed with other generes of dance music, but not 'pure'. People are so eager to label something and make it an exact way and put it in a little neat box, art is subjective. Anyways

As an aside, artists with similar attributes, I'd love to take a listen. thanks!

* SBD is a kick ass track. Although it has recycled components from Fucking Die and Scarry Monsters
* The Reason is more sex mixed with sex. This song is done in a similar style to those he did in the early days of Skrillex. It's a song you hear and think nothing other than ""Fuck yeah it's going to be a good day"". Listen to this shit and you'll be in nothing other than a good mood. You can't be in anything other than a good mood. I don't like the vocals too much though. At least at the beginning. I think it would of sounded a bit better if Sonny did the vocals himself
* Leaving is amazing as well. On the youtube video, he does it fucking well. Summit is an example of this. I really hate brosteppers. DROP BRO WHERE'S THE DROP? SHUT THE FUCK UP PLEASE. I love Skrill's ambient type music. He did it well during the Sonny Moore project and he's doing it well under the name of Skrillex",,False,self,t5_2s7cz,False,,

about paying for something they're giving away for free to another.
That takes away the point of subscribing in the first place.""

""... it's clear piracy I'd probably remove it for the sake of keeping everything on /r/skrillex kosher.""

I would have to agree with all these points. I think the main difference here, and promoting piracy which kinda goes against the logical point of Nest.

First of all

 

Here are some songs that I put together for an EP that came together last minute.  Scary Bolly Dub is a song I've been playing in my sets for a while.  I use it more as a DJ tool

 

The Reason and Leaving came together last minute.  I made Leaving in my hotel room in Mexico and just finished The Reason an hour ago in my hotel room in Miami.  I guess it's just kind of a reflection of how I'm feeling right now.  Hope you guys enjoy these quality WAVS.  

 

Sincerely

Sonny Moore

Back then I had little interest in harder electro


But Kill Everybody was different. It was not like other hard electro songs I heard before. More like a mix between orchestral electro
Somehow I didn't think it was good enough to put in my music library


After a while I just downloaded it with Rock 'n Roll (which turned out to be pretty good after listening a bit longer :D)


After discovering the rest of the SM&amp;NS EP I also got myself All I ask of You and SM&amp;NS (Zedd Remix).
