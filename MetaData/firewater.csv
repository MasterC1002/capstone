1337855363.0,u2k9x,Let's brew: Rum,considerspiders,35,3,16,"**Rum**

Hi, It’s drawn together from lots of different sources, mostly cited at the end in further reading. Split into two parts to fit into self post limits. 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••

**Recipe for the ferment:**   

Rather than just giving out a list of ingredients that someone can repeat



*Sugar source:*    

A roughly 1:1 ratio of feed molasses and white or raw sugar (raw is better, and bacteria are your friends for this, so keep the potential ABV low. It's best to calculate this on the fermentable sugar content of your molasses rather than using a hydrometer, the unfermentables will throw the hydro reading off (for the same reason, expect it to finish dry at 1.02ish). Don't go above 8% ABV (calculated off finishing @ 1.02) or you'll kill the bacteria. If you don't care about that then still, keep it low for a clean ferment, 10% is ok
 Normally feed molasses has around about 50% fermentable sugars, unless you can find a friendly farmer buying in bulk. 


*Liquid:* 

Well aerated water and dunder (spent wash from the still) from the previous batch (a note about aging dunder at the end). Oxygen is essential for yeast multiplication, it's easy to let it get too low over several generations. The ideal pH for the yeast and bacterial combination that we want in a rum is about 5.5-5.6 – you can use calcium carbonate or citric acid to correct, and vary your dunder addition. You can also *carefully* use baking soda, but if you do this with lots or often the sodium will start to slow the yeast down.  

If it's the first batch, but try not to boil the molasses, we want the bacteria living in it to survive if possible.   

The dunder is a critical component for flavour and complexity. It keeps getting better as you go through generations.  

**Additional nutrients:**  

Molasses is normally short on magnesium and nitrogen, you'll probably want to pitch onto about half of it). You can search around the various forums for “Yeast bomb” recipes if you want specific instructions on this. If I recall there are instructions in “Pugirum” and “Pint’s Fast Fermenting Molasses Wash” (links at the bottom). I suggest experimenting to see what works for you – your molasses and water profile is likely different to mine.  

**Yeast:**   

If possible, with a lot of people just using bakers yeast for everything.    

I have some EDV493, so maybe not a great choice if you’re planning on pot stilling and drinking white – it’s better for aged pot stilled stuff or lightly refluxed white. Danstill A is ok. A lot of people use the EC1118 (champagne) strain, and a lot of people do ok with bakers yeast, which in my opinion is only really good as a starting point. I’ve used Belgian beer yeasts with ok results. I would advise you to avoid turbo yeasts. Pitch plenty of whatever you go with. 

 

**Sanitation:**   

This is not as critical as it is in other brewing activities. We don’t need the stuff to “keep” any longer than it takes to get it to the still so don’t worry about anything other than a rinse out. 

**Ferment:**  

Ferment hot

**Speed:**  

Expect a fast ferment. Leave plenty of headroom in the fermenter.

**Clarification:**            
I like to rack and clear my rum - some people like the taste of the boiled yeast in the distillate, chuck in a litre or 3 of water to keep the yeast happy til the next ferment, and leave for another few days in another vessel to settle a bit more. I don't use finings, I'm afraid of what they'll do to the next ferment when I reuse dunder or lees.   

Nowdays I ferment in my brewing fridges with temperature control

Posting White House petitions seems like a iffy issue, considering the downvotes the x-posters have gotten in other threads. It's annoying but whatever. That said, glad to see the petition did well here. 

So the thing with the White House petitions is that there is a 150 signature threshold that you need to bypass in order to get the petition public and to have any real chance of exceeding the 25000 signature goal. If we want to give this petition a chance of getting a reply (no matter which way the reply goes), if you happen to have a facebook act, or other social networking act. please share on there. Craiglist is another possibility unless they have rules against posting petitions. If not, I would say we should work together in posting in as many sub cities as possible, in the right sections of course.

This is what 25 pounds of bananas looks like from the store, when they're disgusting, then they're good to go. 

Every endeavour needs a plan of action. My plan is to buzzed from bananas. First we need a recipe
25 pounds of very ripe bananas, and brown
12 pounds sugar
1 tbs yeast nutrient
1 tbs citric acid or equivalent
pinch of Epsom salt
EC1118 Lavin yeast packet

While heating four gallons of water, and citric acid to boiling, cut ends off bananas and chunk up in inch sized pieces. Place pieces in large tub or fermentor (I use a 16 gallon tub), pour hot water over bananas and blend with drill powered paddle. Add balance (2 gallons) of water to help cool wash to about 95 degrees, then pitch yeast and blend in. After cap forms, punch down daily for the next couple days and keep covered in warm area about 75 degrees to ferment. 
From there we'll just have to see what happens and how fast the ferment goes.

While money's not tight for me at all, taste my mediocre product, and then sell the still for scrap. I tried some moonshine made by one of my dad's students (he's a college prof), and it was terrible, tasted like mildew. I figured that's what my product would taste like.

This is where the story turns around. I really wanted to distill something, and less than an hour later, my collection container was full of a clear white liquid. I poured it into a jar, and let it cool. I tasted it and was very happy with the outcome. 

This experience has given me new motivation to continue in this endeavor. The one thing I wish I had was a local mentor. I do know of a guy who is a friend of a friend that makes grappa in his basement

I'm new to home distillation. So new, I many large pots, propane burners, and fermentation vessels, and experience. 

Rather than try out distillation with a makeshift still, on [this site.](http://moonshine-still.com/) 

First of all

I've ordered ""All"" (I expect I will need more) the parts I will need and will update this post with my progress and first few batches as time progresses. As of writing this

The first step is the tools necessary to finish the job (Bolded I purchased at home depot):

* Drills and Bits
* Center punch
* **Mapp Gas Torch
* steel wool
* bench vice
* **Round file**

Fittings (Purchassed at Home Depot

* 2""x 2""x 1.5"" Reducing Tee
* 2: 1.5""x 1.5""x 0.5"" Reducing Tee
* 1.5""x 1"" Reducing Elbow
* 1""x 1/2"" Reducer
* 2: 1.5"" Caps
* 2"" Cap
* 2"" Threaded copper adapter
* 2"" Stainless Steel Flange  

Copper Pipe (Purchased by the foot at PlumbingSupply.com):

* 2"" x 36"" (Column)
* 1.5"" x 24"" (Condenser shell and cross pipe)
* 1"" x 24"" (Condenser Core)
* 1/2"" x 24"" (Condenser Input / Output flow)

Plans for assembly:
I'm going to follow the reflux-still plans on the website linked above. I've begun to plan my first round of distillations.

Vodka / Moonshine:
I plan on doing a basic cane sugar boil followed by the addition of nutrients and PH stabilizers. I'm going to use campaign yeast and produce roughly 15 gallons of total wash at roughly 10%. I will distill this to the maximum potential of my still (95%)

Whiskey:
I plan on taking 48lbs Marris Otter, for a total of 20 gallons wash at roughly 7-8% fermented by Irish Ale yeast. From there, I will distill it to 75% and cut it to 62.5%. I'm too cheap to opt for the wooden barrels (and I like to see my product), so a 2.5 gallon glass fermentor with french oak chips will have to do (has done well for me in the past with wine and beer).
 
I will update with pictures and progress as I have pictures and progress.

**EDIT 1:**

Based on the Bokakob love in the comments

I will have a secondary condenser which will use the output from the coil to cool the liquid.

This design should cut about $20 off the material cost. It eliminates the need for the following:

* 2""x 2""x 1.5"" Reducing Tee - $20
* 2: 1.5""x 1.5""x 0.5"" Reducing Tee - $28
* 1.5""x 1"" Reducing Elbow - $10
* 1""x 1/2"" Reducer - $7
* 2"" Cap - $7
* 1.5 x 12"" copper tube - $13 (The other 12 inches will be used for my condenser)

It should add the need for the following:

* The 2"" pipe should be 12"" longer (I'm compensating by using my half my 1.5"" tube)
* 1/4 Coil - $10
* 2: 1"" Caps - $8 (Secondary Condenser)
* 1/2"" Elbow - $2 (Secondary Condenser)
* 3"" x 3"" copper plate - Collection Plate
* 1/2"" - Copper Valve and fittings -$10

**EDIT 2:**
The Mash will begin tonight for the single malt whiskey using the very simple recipe:

* 95% Base Marris Otter Malt
* 5% Peat Smoked Malt
* Mashed at 148F (Dry Finish) for 90 Minutes
* Boil for 60-90 minutes to break down protein chains
* Crash cooled with immersion chiller
* Low Ester Ale Yeast fermented slightly below recommended temperatures (65F) 
* High Oxygenation of wort to facilitate yeast reproduction and decrease ester production
* Primary fermentation for 4-7 days followed by racking to a secondary vessel for clarification for 3-4 days (I won't need longer to ""improve"" flavor so long as fermentation is complete). In actuality
* At this point

The wash for my vodka / moonshine will be a bit simpler. I'll take hot water and add sugar until its starting gravity is roughly 1.075. This will be heated to sterilize. I will cool the mixture. I will add nutrient and PH stabilizers. It will be fermented with champagne yeast until its final gravity is below 1.00 (roughly 10% abv). Sugar leads to high fusel alcohol production

For tonight

**Edit 3:**

I've got the supplies

However the wine is treated with sulfite and I understand that can be a problem.  
1) Can the sulfite be removed via the copper in the still itself?  
2) Does the entire still including boiler need to be copper or can just the still head itself?
3) If a copper still won't solve the problem what about carbon filtration?  Or treating the wine with ascorbic acid to oxidize all the sulfur?

1356018030.0,1565wo,Let's talk about freeze distillation,4merpunk,16,5,50,"It's kinda that time of year to talk about freeze distillation (I live in a northern state that hasn't seen a proper winter in about a decade so that's where the 'kinda' comes in).  

Freeze distillation is a simple process of where you take your wash or wort and place it in a suitable container (either in two liters for your home freeze or leave it in a bucket and place it outside during a heavy cold) and remove chunks of ice to increase your abv.  It's a very passive type of distillation that almost any homebrewer or distiller can do and requires no purchasing of equipment, propane).

Freeze distillation is the primary way to create such beauties as applejack (which is taking a hard cider, are going back and forth in creating the strongest beer in the world and I hypothesize they use freeze distillation to create that, but I am not sure).

We've had only a few posts in the past about freeze distillation and different mods that people use ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/firewater/comments/kc1kt/use_a_salad_spinner_for_efficient/) was a fun one about a salad spinner) so take heart and tell us about what you do or might plan to do this year.",self,t5_2rcpo,False,,a,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/firewater/comments/1565wo/lets_talk_about_freeze_distillation/

*Kahlua

1.75l of vodka (neutral flavored spirit is the idea)
1l of coffee (full standard pot of coffee
     When making the coffee you want it to be super strong. Much
32 oz of sugar

Honestly its super super simple make your coffee, put in a dark place and shake every so often. The longer it sits the better. I lost a bottle for about 4 years, found it and had to fight my mother for it. For a bit of a bonus add a bit of root beer extract. I dont know why but that really worked out. If not that try a almond extract. 

*Neutral into something that tastes like Peach brandy (apparently

1 large-ish jar of peaches (people say to use fresh
1 lb of brown sugar turned into simple syrup
A few squeezes (probably 2-3 oz) of agave nectar
Top off w/ a neutral liquor (mine was about 85-90 proof)

Add the simple syrup to a pint mason jar, shake, store in a dark place, profit. I gave a jar away after 3-4 days and the test subjects said it tasted like brandy.

*Untested/tasted Fireball (this one is still aging so ymmv

Fill a pint mason jar with dried chilies in alternating layers with marschino cherries, shake every so often. Like I said in the title I havent tried this one yet, so Ill update this post when I man up enough to give it a taste. 

So all of that being said I want to see what other people do with their shine when they're not drinking it straight. The holidays are coming up and these are super easy (and cheap) gift ideas.

1 gallon of Rum Liqueur... The recipe was found in Benjamin Franklin's papers and dates to 1750.

**The original Recipe:**
To a Gallon of Rum two Quarts of Orange Juice and two pound of
Sugar-dissolve the Sugar in the Juice before you mix it with the Rum
-put all together in a Cask &amp; shake it well-let it stand 3- or 4-Weeks &amp;
it will be very fine &amp; fit for Bottlingwhen you have Bottled off the
fine pass the thick thro' a Philtring paper put into a Funnell-that not
a drop may be lost. To obtain the flavour of the Orange Peel paire a few Oranges &amp; put it in Rum for twelve hours-&amp; put that Rum into the Cask with the other-For Punch thought better without the Peel.

**My Version:**

* 5 litres white spirit @ 40%vol

* Navy dark rum essence (for 2.25 litres according to the pack) - so I got a light coloured liquid in the end with nice rummy notes

* Juice of 8 seville oranges

* Zest of 3 seville oranges

* 32 grams vanilla bean paste (I find it gives a subtle vanillin note that normally comes with oak aging)

* 500 grams golden syrup

* 100 grams Tennessee Bourbon Oak chips.

Leave to develop for 3 months, and bottle...

Even without a gasket around the pot lid, but is it necessary? I was planning on doubling the binder clip count up to 20 also.

Now

All seemed to be working well except for the brass union at the start of the liebeg condensor that I installed for easy disassembly. The union kind of looks like [this one](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/fitting-copper-union-1-2-inch/959996?oldLookup=Burlington#) except it's brass. I wasn't a huge fan of having brass in my vapor stream so I foolishly tinned the face of the union, or is it better to desolder it and toss it for a new union (which will hopefully be copper as pictured)? If I can't use a union like this, is there any way I can make my condensor arm able to come apart from my column. Are NPT fittings any better?

(7.5# sugar 6# corn 18.5 Litres water) I boiled about half the water to dissolve the sugar and added that first. Then added the rest of the water to top the buckets up. At the time the water was still a bit hot to add yeast. As I waited for it to cool to 90F I left the lids resting on with a quarter of the liquid exposed to air. When it was cool enough I added one pack of ec1118 yeast to  each bucket. The next morning there were little to no signs of fermentation happening. So I sprinkled in some bread yeast on top and both buckets started going as normal. Now one bucket looks like it always does [bucket #1](http://i.imgur.com/BZokBAK.jpg) and the other has a yeast cap going on [Bucket #2](http://i.imgur.com/nHDbqUh.jpg) I'm wondering if I caught some wild yeast somehow or if this sort of thing has happened to anyone else.,t5_2rcpo,True

2 - Kept the cider at 10° F for two days and took about 2.5 of water ice out of the solution over that time.

3 - I now have 1.5 gallons of strong tasting solution resting to get the strange yeast cloud to settle to the bottom.  By my math - .6 of a gallon of alcohol is still in the 1.5 liquid

The column I've bought has no valve between the reflux column and the condenser column

The column I have is designed so that I can plumb water to run through the condenser and then into the reflux coil in a contiguous loop

So, boiled 2 gallons of water, and let it steep in the mix for 20min.  Ended up with half a brewing bucket of freaking MUSH.   Added more warm water and stirrred the best I could until I got to 6gal.

Added EC1118

Bubbles for a few days, so I added a bit more water.   

I racked after it seemed to slow fermenting....got 5gallon paint strainer sacks (or all-grain brew-in-bag sack), I put a few small jars on the bottom, to keep the sack off the bottom.  This allows SOME to drain into the bucket.

That is not fun, I took the rest of the bag over to my neighbor and gave it to him to feed his chickens.

SO, then cold crashed it.
Also, but I also don't know the standard for animal feed....it might help (roughage)....

SO
Went quick.  I don't knot he SG or FG due to it being a weird set of fermenting liquids/solids.   I got 1/2 gallon of spirit down to tails or 40%. I gave up since the taste was very....umm....sick tasting.  Mixed together was 50%.   I didn't get more than 60% off the run

Will let open for a few days, I'm also a rum-boy, so I don't know what whiskey/shine is supposed to taste like.

In short, as others have mentioned.   If you find out your bag is pellets, take it back.   

Next up for me.  cracked corn.  Can't screw that up

**TLDR:** Producer's Pride All Stock Sweet Feed is pellets, and produces very little.  Don't even bother thinking you can do it :)

So I did just that - hydrated 1.5 lb of a 2 lb brick of red star

I was pleased at the vigor of the fermentation.  It had pretty much completed after 5 days, but was pretty much dry.  (If you were a high-school student looking for 20 gallons of cheap wine, this would be just the ticket at a little over $1/gallon of 15% alcohol).

Then I did a stripping run.  Seemed like there were more heads than usual, I started tasting tails.  Ay-yi-yi.  I ended up keeping the middle part of the run, despite the heads and tails flaws in it, and rested these fake hearts on active carbon for a week, hoping for luck.  They improved some, but not enough, so today I did another spirit run to try and get a better separation.  No dice.  So now I've got a couple gallons of vile-tasting not-so-neutral ethanol that'll just have to be made into windshield-washer fluid or something.

I guess the moral of the story is - there's just no substitute for good yeast nutrient.  When I consider the time and materials wasted

Limoncello is very easy if you can get yourself some, soak a few weeks, strain, then dilute with a simple syrup to say 35%. Add a touch of food grade glycerin for an amazing mouthfeel.

Would one want to conduct a sour mash across multiple generations or just create a fresh ingredient ferment each time? I'm a little unsure on when a sour mash is recommended or what even the benefit is.

Is doing multiple stripping runs followed by a single spirit run always needed for a recipe like this? Just a personal preference? For a first time ever attempt at distilling

I've been putting it off for a while for fear of not fully understanding how to build one or what all is involved. I figured you guys might be able to help me put off some of them and answer specific questions I couldn't find much information.

*Please note again

So here are a few of my concerns and questions:

I plan on building [this](http://homedistiller.org/image/mini_explained.jpg) type of still. As I understand it the cooling element is at the top and the slanted plates catch the condensed vapors as they rise

* Is there a minimum length I should consider when building this type of still? 
* How close should the slanted plates be to the condenser? 
* Everyone seems to have a fancy valve to control flow of spirits leaving the still
* Temperature control

I'm having trouble understanding some of the process of distilling. I understand there is a point at with your *mixture* must boil in order to produce. 

* When heating mash do you simply blast the heat until the mixture boils or bring it up to a boil slowly?
* Do you measure this mixture temperature directly? Basically do you have a thermometer in the mixture itself?

Last question:
I read for one recipe of mash that for a 20L run you throw out the first 50-100ml. 

* If I made a smaller run

I understand that a lot of the stigma about methanol in the distilling world isn't as bad as folks say it is

Right now I basically want to make sure that I know how the still posted in the link above works. I think that's a reasonable first still to create and I would enjoy making it. Any advice,,False,self,t5_2rcpo,1355703902.0,,True

Oak infusions (~70% in a 1 gallon jar with 2 cups of oak chips for a month or two) introduce more dissolved materials which fall out of solution when diluted as well; so I have learned to remove large particles (ss mesh) then dilute and allow things to settle BEFORE filtering. 

Not sufficiently filtering these out has resulted in post consumption morning urine which smells strongly of a campfire

Will an aluminum bain marie  that is inside of a traditional copper alembic kettle likely cause any problems with the quality of the distillate? I do know that there are aluminum pressure cookers available which are rated to withstand temperatures much higher than 100 Deg C and are rated as food safe so there shouldn't be an issue with aluminum toxicity. 

The vapors will be primarily in contact with the copper interior of the kettle, and worm.... should be all good right?

Thanks!

Three questions:
Is there a such thing as a stripping run on a reflux? Do you just run it balls to the wall with the packing out of it and valve opened? Or just no strip and run it like regular? 

And is it uncommon to use a worm condenser with a boka or what? Issues? Everyone seems to go liebig but I've got access to a shit load of 1/4 inch so was planning on just using that into a bucket with water and ice (also have access to a commercial ice machine so figure why not).

I'd ideally like to work out a design that won't overwhelm my small apartment kitchen, and I like the cold-finger double helix condenser style for a reflux setup since its so compact and effective. I'm planning to use a fountain pump and bucket setup for condenser water, I'm just not sure whether I want to go with a design with a minimal length permanent column that can be unpacked to switch to pot still operation, or a section of column that is only installed for reflux operation and removed for pot-still mode. My concern is that a removable column increases cost since I'd need unions or tri-clamps to connect it in an airtight manner, and a short permanent column may impair reflux operation.

So given that I want to keep size and cost as low as I can without sacrificing too much on reflux operation,False,self,t5_2rcpo,False,,,t3_1f7jvl
