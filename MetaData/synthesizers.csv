There's a lot of mention of VCOs and DCOs, both here on r/synthesizers and elsewhere as well. But it's rarely discussed in detail what those terms really mean or what the differences are (except in how they might sound). As an electronics and computer geek, these different oscillator designs interested me when I started looking into synths myself, and I started to read up on them. As I went on, I felt that I got quite a few misconceptions cleared up, and when I read various forum threads I got the impression that there were some common misconceptions others had as well about how VCOs and DCOs work, the whole analog vs digital thing, it appears to be few dealing with this particular subject. 

Anyways, and also to share what I've found with others, so I decided to write a short ""guide"" (which became a bit longer than I planned). I have tried to make this as basic as possible, but I also feel that going a bit into the details is important. I am not an electronics engineer or anything like that, so I can't guarantee that the details are 100% correct, and maybe I'll leave out stuff that is important. English also isn't my native language so there's probably quite a few spelling errors or grammatical errors. In any case, please leave a comment if you find something that's wrong!


**A quick recap of what an audio signal is**

An audio signal is basically a voltage that varies with time. When run through an amplifier and through a speaker, and what we get is basically what we call a sound wave. 

As most probably know, and the further our ear drums get pushed and pulled. Our brain perceives this as the sound being louder. How far out the audio signal swings is called the signal's *amplitude*. In a typical synth, this is what we control with the amplifier section (the VCA or attenuator in many analogs). 

As we also know

A pitch is what the brain perceives when the sound has a repetitious pattern. If there is no recognizable pattern repeating (or not repeating often enough), and conversely, an audio signal that repeats 20 times a second has a frequency of 20 Hz. 

The timbre is determined by how the signal 'acts' during each repetition. For instance, and actually how we perceive the sound (this probably sounds very fuzzy and strange, so if you need a better explanation, please read [here](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may99/articles/synthsec.htm)).


**The oscillator**

As most probably know, a set of harmonics. This then gets sent through one or several filters, where the signal is altered by removing harmonics from the signal. When we bypass the filter(s) completly (usually by turning low pass cutoff all the way up, or high pass cutoff all the way down), we get the raw signal from the oscillator. 

As mentioned above, if ever, controlled by the oscillator (it is usually done by the amplifier / attenuator), so we can drop that. That leaves the pitch and timbre. The pitch is the only thing that is completely controlled by the oscillator. The timbre results from what wave shape the oscillator produces (remember that the wave shape is a result of the harmonics present), and the filter that it's run through (the filter removes harmonics).

An oscillator, and produces the initial audio signal with the desired pitch. This signal can be something like a pulse wave or a saw wave. The job of the wave shaping circuit is to take in the initial signal and derive other kinds of wave forms, such as pulse, square and triangle waves *from* this initial wave form.

Now we are ready to start looking at VCOs and DCOs and how they work

* **VCO** (voltage controlled oscillator)
* **DCO** (digitally controlled oscillator): Oscillators that are digitally controlled
* **DDS** (direct digital synthesizer): Oscillators that are both digitally controlled and produce wave shapes digitally

(A DDS is also digitally controlled, mostly because that's what it has historically been called, and it is the name that has been used on most DCO synths.)

Synths which use VCOs or DCOs are called analog, is analog. Synths that use DDSs but otherwise have analog circuitry are often called ""hybrid synths"" or ""analog/digital synths"". If we employ these three definitions, we can classify some of the popular vintage synths as follows:

* **VCO**: Nearly all 70s synths and high-end 80s synths (Moogs, Oberheims, ...)
* **DCO**: Roland's Juno and JX series, Oberheim Matrix series
* **DDS**: All samplers such as the Ensoniq ESQ-1 or SQ-80, PPG Wave

**EDIT**: An explanation of each of these three follows in the comments.
**EDIT2*: Changed DWG to DDS which is a more used term.",self,t5_2rdyc,1359681694.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/17lkoq/the_long_and_boring_vco_and_dco_explanation/

Each synth has its own quirks and personality, fuck him.  

I don't know why I make these posts.  I assume that many of you synth junkies feel the same way.  I just find it interesting how unique I feel this quality is to synths.  Other instruments, but that sound doesn't vary much without external gear.  A poor analogy would be something along the lines of a guitar being like a color, but a synth is like a palette of colors.  A synth doesn't have access to every color, but rather a limited set of complimentary colors and tones.

MS-20 Mini. I just wanted to see if there was any interest in possibly purchasing either a kit version or an assembled version. The board will be created using Eagle and sent off to a professional board-house. I plan on using both through-hole and surface mount parts. 
Below is a list of features I intend on using and a few things I haven't decided yet. Please feel free to throw in suggestions:

Clocking will be controlled in a few ways: 
External clock
External gates or triggers
Internal clock
External MIDI sync


A microcontroller will control 3 channels with 8 steps. These channels can be shortened to less then 8 steps, or at their own speeds in relation to the clock (clock*2, clock/2,  ect.). 

Each step will include a switch to turn off the gate at the step, and a fine tuning knob(not sure if I should include it). There will also be a switch to choose whether or not portamento will be on for that step (thing 303 slide). Each of the 8 steps will output it's own CV and gate/trigger. Each step's CV will also be converted to digital, converted to MIDI, and sent out the MIDI along with the MIDI sync. Each of the channels will output on it's own MIDI channel.

Controls for each channel include timing, up/down, down/up, random), portamento, duty cycle, and a switch to choose between 0-5V, and +/-5.

General controls will include a speed knob (disabled when receiving external clock or MIDI sync) and a shuffle knob.

* Bi-Weekly Collaboration/feedback thread: There's a lot of excellent musicians on here and sometimes when people post tracks on their own they get buried. If there was a specific thread for original music

* Monthly Gear trading/selling thread. Pretty much speaks for itself.

Other subs seem to have these kind of threads posted by a bot. I have no idea how that might be set up but if even they weren't posted every day/week like clockwork it could still work.

I can't wait for Elektron to implement poly (or even unison) mode and don't want to resort to hacks like using a MIDIPal to split MIDI commands.

In order to do this without a huge amount of hassle I need a nice polyphonic synth like a Roland Juno/Jupiter

However

I'm not sure if a VA synth will do what I need, but because *the user interface on most of them seems terrible*. Reading [reviews of the Jupiter 80](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug11/articles/roland-jupiter-80.htm) was confusing - parts? layers? registration? What the hell?

My wishlist:

* Polysynth - capability for lush pads is mandatory

* Fully analog or well-done VA synth engine

* Lots of knobs for direct control of parameters

* No touchscreens, or similar BS

* Patch memory would be nice

* Arpeggiator

* Basic sequencer (or programmable arpeggiator phrases)

* MIDI capable or possible to retrofit with a kit of firmware upgrade

How do I get all these features in one package without spending [~$8

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR:

* Are there any cheaper lesser-known analog synths that can achieve that classic 80s polysynth sound?

* Are there any budget VA synths that don't suck and have lots of knobs for direct control?

* If not

* An okay price to spend is around $2,000 is the hard limit, for sure.",,False,self,t5_2rdyc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/1i6m54/the_80s_sound_on_a_budget/

I've dicked around with Massive for about a year and a half, but with only 16 encoders, it wasn't quite cutting it for sound design or ""fun-ness"".

So i decided i should buy a hardware synth right before i even heard of the NAMM in January. 

A week and a half of heavy research later

It [arrived at work](http://i.imgur.com/tRPlY11.jpg) yesterday

This box was actually inside a larger box with some bubble wrap for shipping. It came through unscathed

The Sub was in there [pretty snug](http://i.imgur.com/ZdYvI5c.jpg). The cardboard thing is basically a diagram of the front panel with some comments on the various sections that briefly describe each of the sections and parameters (parameters? knobs? Is there a specific term for these that i can't remember?).

Underneath the synth were a number of [other items](http://i.imgur.com/uAOKeoL.jpg). Registration card, ""A Brief History of the Minimoog Voyager"" (the brown item on the bottom), a product catalog (green, middle), a printed manual (which is also available in .pdf and i believe has already superseded the printed version), and a Flying Lotus puzzle. I'm not a fan of puzzles, but it's a nice touch anyway

Mine is number [408](http://i.imgur.com/dnh9cv9.jpg). I've seen #22 here on reddit a while back

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/k8qNQn9.jpg) a shot to catch the entire front panel. Basically nothing new to say here, so no last minute changes were put through on the panel.

As you can see

I messed around with it a bit after work last night

I gotta say

The knobs feel so great. They're smooth

Yeah, at least when it comes to non-rare synths, which makes that explanation kind of dubious), and/or maybe they only have need for a bass instrument, having all other instruments already covered. But that leads me to my main question:

Does it really save a manufacturer money to make a synth that only produces tones in a few (4-5?) octaves versus the whole spectrum? How is it even possible for an oscillator to not produce the whole frequency range without being artificially limited? All an oscillator does is convert the direct current from the power supply into an alternating, oscillating current signal. According to wikipedia, an audio oscillator by definition produces frequencies in the full audio range, from about 16 Hz to 20 kHz.

So, that's about the only thing I can come up with to explain their existence, since I see no reason why a Moog Voyager wouldn't be just as capable at producing bass tones as a Minitaur (therefore removing the need for some kind of dedicated bass synth), or why a Minitaur shouldn't be just as capable as the Voyager at producing tones from across the entire audible frequency spectrum.

I've never used a bass synth before, I would love to hear what you guys (and gals) have to say about all this. What do you think? Am I completely missing the point, here?

The main goal is that the setup be simple and straightforward enough that I loose nothing while attempting to translate my ideas into music when I need it(and not spend an hour setting up a single patch... already have stuff for that), God forbid, show my face in public somewhere) to jam. I just want to be able to try a different approach and setting that's different than working in a studio.

So with all these goals, sampling, a handful of effects, and a 4 track recorder... it almost sounds too good to be true, so of course I have a few fears. First and foremost, are the sounds varied and mutable enough? My biggest passion is sound design. When I have a good sound I like, that's what I usually build upon for a track. Will I feel like I've exhausted all the sonic possibilities in the course of a matter of months? Does everything coming out of the instrument end up sounding repetitious after awhile? There's a lot of stuff I could get instead for that kind of money

Many other setups are possible, along with a Monotribe (but that wouldn't have quite the immediacy I'm hoping for). I could get a little netbook, load it with Reaper and maybe some VSTs, get a few buildable syth kits (like a Mee Blip, the Mutable Instruments stuff, or any other small interesting boxes), and play with a small MIDI controller (or a Korg Nanokey for extra added smallness).

* Get yourself a oscilloscope and a regulated power supply. Without oscilloscope its impossible to debug the circuit. Regulate the current to 200 mA or whatever is the expected maximum current. It will save your components in case of a short circuit.
* Never give up
* Try to understand the circuit. Even if you don't understand the details
* Troubleshooting: first check the power supply and related components. What voltage is on the output of the voltage regulators? Check the voltage on the ICs
* Though I didn't do it

I've been considering getting an Elektron Machinedrum. I'm not sure if it's the right drum machine for me

We do something like electro. Sort of like Cybotron (even with the guitar! only run through a mooger fooger freqbox). Broken beat and groovy. The intent is a ""live"" band with this (hardware only

Examples of the bands we're looking up to are: [Blastromen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxm6Q19WKmM), [Diplomat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQlwrv7lfF0), [Dopplereffekt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnZJihkgnk0). We're not quite doing this style, but, it's our jumping off point.

For the most part, for that to happen, I need a drum machine to replace it.

The drum machines I'm considering are the Tempest and Machinedrum (either the UW model or the non-UW model).

**Tempest**: When this was announced, the workflow didn't seem to be what I was looking for. I love the sound, but, I don't know if I could make friends with the interface. That and it's twice the price of the Machinedrum non-UW model.

**Machinedrum (non-UW model)**: The sequencer would be like second nature at this point. I don't care that it's not analog. The FM and PI machines intrigue me the most. But, I spend the most amount of time of the hats. I know no one can tell me if my subjective wants will be met, but, is the range of metallic and useful sounds pretty wide?

**Machinedrum (UW model)**: I have an Octatrack and am not sure the extra $500 is necessary? I rather like the idea that I can resample itself and build up ""layered drums"" that way. One of my problems with the Octatrack is that I like to make drums specific for songs, samples are kinda needed for what we're doing, so, it's either get this one, or, keep using some tracks on the Octatrack for drums.

I have an Electribe ER-1. I really like it the synth voices, so I can p-lock the hell out of it with the Octatrack ... with code that probably works ... if I ever get around to finishing it).

I have a bunch of mid-late 80s drum machines (RX5, R50e, HR16, DDD1, DR550), but, none are synth based. Nor would I want to take them out to play live. They are strictly studio pieces. And, I feel vaguely uncomfortable shaking a stick at them. :D

I have all three Volcas on order, lol! I think they'll be fun jam boxes.

My bandmate just picked up a drumstation

The Jomox boxes and the Miami are all a little too niche for me. I'm not overly concerned with x0x sounds.

I'm not interested in VSTs; I plan to play live, however, look at the Korg Electribe SX-1 and the Nord Drum. I like the electribe for the sequencer and all of those extra features, but the drum synthesis sounds pretty limited, if nonexistent. I like the Nord Drum because of its pure barebones analog modeled synth engine. I'm also into DIY synth stuff and could build some sequencers to trigger the drums, so the sequencer isn't a necessity, but quite convenient.

Sorry if that was a bit of a rant

Oh, I'm trying drum synthesis to get those kind of abstract, indescribable percussive sounds Aphex Twin uses a lot. I don't really know much of the theory behind it, so I don't even know if that's possible. I know RDJ tampers with his stuff a lot.

So I thought wouldn't it be great if I could use these admittedly sometimes poor imitations I make with my voice as instructions for my synths? So for example when I say swoooosh, the vst would also try its best at making a swoooosh using its own sound generators and following the envelope of my voice.

In general, then a lead. This leads to some cool stuff but I end up limited to the one chord.

[Take a listen to Giorgio by Morodor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpsBeaVrkE). So there's a nice little arpeggio that cycles through a sequence of a bunch of chords

So my question is

Is there a function or a device that would let me input a sequence and turn it into an arpeggio that I could play with any combination of notes? Like say I input 1-2-1-3-1-4

This may be in my arsenal somewhere already.. I have in my collection: Fantom G6, Gaia, MG-1, Korg N5, Korg M1, Korg Electribe EMX-1.

I know that the Fantom has _some_ sort of ability to import a MIDI file as an arp but every example I've seen of it on youtube seems to indicate that it has no dynamic nature to it except it will shift pitches depending on the single note you start it on.

Thanks!

Quick edit: For a workflow example, for example how the Roland Gaia has a phrase recorder) and run through my sequence of 4 or 8 bars once. Then I hit loop and it works on its own from then on and I can move on to my other synths.

What I _don't_ want to do is simply input the entire sequence beforehand.

At this point, because I love almost everything about the DSI PEK-PE: It's 4-osc per voice, it's nearly knob per function, it has both analog and digital/wavetable synthesis, and personally I think it sounds great. But it only has 4 voices.

I've owned monosynths before, piano-player mindset. The thing is, as far as polysynths go, I've never owned anything with less than 8 voices before, which is as low as I'm certain that I'll be comfortable with. 

I know the obvious advice is to play a PolyEvolver in person to see how I feel about the polyphony, but when I went back to try it out a week or so later, it was already sold.

So, but I'm looking for something with more bite in the sound and a bigger keyboard than the JP and more onboard controls than the Q rack. I've only got 10 fingers, so I don't expect much more than that from any instrument, but I like knowing I can drop all 10 of them on the keyboard and have the Q make sound for every note.

I have a 1990's Kurzweil K2600x I bought at an excellent deal -- only $150!  It came with a sustain pedal and a midi sampling board and a huge road case.   It's an older synth but according to the internet it's an excellent one.

I don't know anything about synths and I am no performer...I like to make noise and attempt music.   However when I was looking for a digital piano I knew I wanted something with 88-keys and excellent fit and finish with detail given to the keyboard.  I was looking at a Yamaha P-95 but they were too expensive.  After a year of looking I found this beautiful machine

It has a ton of features and a massive manual.  It uses a software architecture called VAST.  It seems a little dated but still comprehensive and once you figure out how to layer recordings it actually becomes easy to use.  I've read that some serious musicians used this synth back in the day like Trent Reznor and Pink Floyd.

Also, given that Moog really has kind of maxed out their current formula of monophonic oscillators, down to the cheapest Minitaur.

So what do you guys think?  does anyone have any insider info?

$2000 budget (give or take a few hundred)
1. Modular synth
2. Prophet '08
3. Grab bag

I'm looking to expand in my music hardware and I'm having a hard time deciding on which route to go. I figured I would get some good advice from you guys! 

The type of music that I take part in is varied. Some dance, etc... For the most part, software and midi controllers have been the backbone of how I have been producing. I really want to break out of relying on software for my sounds, so I am looking in investing in some hardware.  I have a few synths such as the Novation Ultranova that I have been working with recently, but I would like to expand a bit further. 

I've been looking into modular synths for a while now and would really enjoy learning to use this type of instrument. They have a very steep price to say the least

The DSI Prophet '08 seems like an amazing synthesizer. I've been listening to clips, it's used by some musicians that I really respect (Radiohead, for example), and it seems that the sound would be really fun to manipulate. The main con I have with this purchase would be that it will take my entire budget. This isn't a make-or-break con, but it would be nice to be able to have some budget left over for other items.

The third is full of recommendations. Moog Slim Phatty rack, Roland SH-201, etc... And whatever you could think to recommend. It would be a mix and match depending on what I could fit into the budget.  I don't have many strict guidelines that I'm trying to meet. I prefer polyphony, but that obviously isn't a strict choice. 

If you guys could give me your opinion or advice I would greatly appreciate it. Also

TL;DR - I have $2000 to spend on a setup! Should I go for the modular moneypit

I bought a vintage Korg Mono/Poly that's having a very specific problem and I'm trying to pinpoint the cause. I know the basics and theory of electronics/circuit design/components having taken a heavy course as part of my Physics education

When I power it on, and I can tweak the frequency and waveform of both LFOs and watch the flashing LEDs respond correctly. The trouble is, I get no sound when I play the keys or try to trigger it via CV, and I believe I know why: none of the KEY ASSIGN MODE buttons light up or respond when I press them (here's a picture for reference: http://www.sequencer.de/pix/korg/monopoly_lfo.jpg). These buttons select which mode the synth plays in (i.e. mono unison, chord memory, poly, etc) and at least one should be selected at all times. The synth should default to unision when powered on

You can check out the circuit schematics on the service manual (http://synthdiy.com/files/2007/KorgMonoPoly-ServiceManual.pdf). In particular, SW UNISON, SW CHORD, SW HOLD). I'm not an expert with circuit schematics so I'm having trouble making sense of it all, but I know that at least one of these switches should be active at all times, and it's as though none of them are getting power. Can any of you see on the schematic where the fault might be? I've already tried reseating their connections on the mainboard, which is easily accessible by popping the hood

I asked the place if I could trade (not the same place I bought my synth) and they said the value of it is almost half of what I paid for my brand new Little Phatty.

I also just found out theres a VST for the little phatty, but still i'm able to see where the parameters are.  But i still want that freedom to mess around with knobs.

It would also need to be strong enough to hold some older analog synths.  

I was considering building my own A-Frame stand from wood until I came across this A-Frame stand from On-Stage Stands http://onstagestands.com/products/view/116973 which looks like it could fit the bill.



Edit: I would like to place 2 (or more) of my smaller synths one a single tier.

Edit 2: I came across this picture of Chromeo's studio

Hello!

Over at EDM they are having great success with their feedback threads

With a feedback thread it might be more encouraging for people to post. I have thought about posting ""listen"" posts

While this reddit focus more on gear than production, and people rarely share their *process* for production. Maybe when you post music in this thread you'd have to preface it with [genre] and what gear you used? Of course, 100% hardware made music isn't required, but as long as some aspect of it is hardware, it  would be a welcome addition to the thread.

What do you guys think?",self,t5_2rdyc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/18nxx0/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_weekly_feedback/
