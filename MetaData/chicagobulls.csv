I've been working on this little side project of mine for the past month or so since I thought I could make a good contribution to this subreddit so here it is.

I'm currently setting up the new flair icons so you guys will have to go ahead and re-assign yours once I'm done implementing all of them. I've done quite a lot of them and there will be some surprises in the future with those which I think you guys might enjoy.

One important thing to note

I guess that's about it from me

GO BULLS!

**EDIT**: I forgot to mention one of the new feature of the subreddit which is a little bar at the top for links to official ""game threads"" for people to discuss the game as it progresses as well as a themed boxscore

#### Example

TEAM|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|FINAL
:-|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
[](#BULLS) Chicago Bulls|19|17|29|27|**92**
[](#HEAT) @Miami Heat|12|22|21|32|87

**Derrick Rose Era**

With only a 1.7% chance of winning the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery the Chicago Bulls won and selected Derrick Rose first overall. The Bulls made the playoffs the next two seasons led by a core of Rose, the hiring of Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau made the team what it is today. Thibodeau agreed to a three-year contract in late June. Carlos Boozer, the Bulls big name free agent acquisition, was signed to a five-year $80 million contract that summer. Led by MVP Derrick Rose, a core of Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Boozer and a bench affectionately called the [Bench Mob](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcROFZX6arMWz4JHEAKky0yGyC9nAGhNfQgiM1yRJAO8rthJ4EgW) finished with an NBA best record of  62-20 in the 2010-2011 season. After making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1998 the Bulls lost in 5 games to the Miami Heat. The 2011-2012 season was injury plagued for the Bulls. Newly signed Richard Hamilton and Derrick Rose faced nagging injuries all season. Key contributor C.J. Watson and Luol Deng also missed several games. The Bulls still managed to finish with a 50-16 record good for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs. Although the Bulls won the first game 103-91 the game ended in [tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o). With Derrick Rose out and Joakim Noah spraining his ankle in Game 3, and signed Nate Robinson

**2012-13 Regular Season Summary**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysLfnIWF0r8)

*Bullets of key instances of the 2012-13 season. 1-4 sentences

* Expectations were mixed for this season. Some fans thought this season was a lost cause and that we had no chance due to Rose’s injury. Others expected a solid playoff team.

* We ended 3 big streaks this year. The Knicks’ 13 game winning streak

* Derrick Rose's injury was a constant source of drama all season. The media and fans were constantly wondering will he or won't he. Fans had a split opinion over the issue

* The emergence of Jimmy Butler and the Joakim Noah becoming an All-star give Bulls fans a reason to be excited for the future.

* Nagging injuries for Luol Deng and Noah were a constant worry during the season. Some feel that their injuries were only made worse by the amount of minutes Coach Thibs played them as both were in the top 15 in [MPG](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/assists/sort/avgMinutes).
 Some fans also speculate that Noah's [shoes](http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/outside-shot/Chicago-Bulls-Joakim-Noah-Le-Coq-Sportif-199856811.html) are the reason for his troubles.

* Overall the team missed 113 games due to injuries. In addition to Deng and Noah

* Nate Robinson proved to be one biggest steals of the off season. He put up 13.1 PPG and 4.4 APG on a vet minimum contract. He also performed phenomenally in the playoffs

* In my opinion it was a great season to be a Bulls fan. Although we didn't get too far in the postseason

* We ended the season with a 45-37 record good enough for the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. 


**Playoffs**

*[Recap of playoffs

* *1st Round: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (4) Brooklyn Nets* 
 The Bulls faced the 4th seeded Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs. They lost the first game of the series but won the next three. Game 4 took 3 over times to complete. Nate Robinson went off for 34, with Joakim Noah and Marco Belinelli both dropping 24 points. 

* *ECSF: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (1) Miami Heat* 
 The Bulls were ready to play when they met the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena. The Bulls beat the out of sync Heat (they had eight days off)
__________


**2013-2014**


2013 Draft | Position | Pick(From) |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Tony Snell | SF | 20th (New Mexico) |

Tony Snell often draws comparisons to his former high school teammate Kawhi Leonard. I think I would be speaking for all Bulls fans but we would be ecstatic if Snell came close to being that good. Snell will not be the rebounder that Kawhi is but he is the epitome of a 3 and D player. He shot 39% from three in his junior year and he performed well in the summer league as can be seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSU-NY52o4) His defense was very good in college, defense, and most importantly shooting to the Bulls. I was not a very big fan of this pick when it was made (I wanted a backup C for Jo) but the more I see the more I like Tony Snell. 

2013 Draft | Position | Pick(From) |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Erik Murphy | PF | 49th (Florida) |

Every team needs one. That tall guy that shoots threes. If he makes the team (he probably will due to our money situation and he isn’t that bad) he will fill that role. A phenomenal shooter in college (shot 45.3% as a senior) Murphy could be a decent role player. He does lack athleticism and length which will hinder his defence in the NBA. His shooting is all that matters though as the Bulls are in desperate need of it.


2013-14 FA Additions | Position | Acquired From|
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Mike Dunleavy | SF | Milwaukee Bucks |
[Player] | [Pos] | [2012-13 Team] |
[Player] | [Pos] | [2012-13 Team]  |
[Player] | [Pos] | [2012-13 Team]  |

**Expectations**  

/u/awesomeoisawe45 : Expectations for the Bulls are high, Dunleavy, Snell, and Gibson all being able to play multiple roles. With 3 players who have made All-Star teams in addition to Rose, role players like Hinrich, Dunleavy, and Gibson
If injuries become a problem the Bulls may struggle. The bottom half of the bench is not as deep as it has been in past years. Hopefully young players like Marquis Teague

/u/wjbc :  The Bulls have great potential this year, Butler, Deng, Boozer, Noah, Hinrich, Dunleavy, particularly if Noah has foot problems again
So if everyone stays healthy, the Bulls could contend for the best record in the league. But if not everyone stays healthy, Rose is hobbled, or Butler regresses, well, that's another matter.
Most Bulls fans want to focus on the upside, it could be 60, or 50. If the starters are healthy anything less seems unlikely. But make no mistake about it, the Bulls want to contend this year, they wouldn't be over the salary cap otherwise. There are going to be some changes next summer, so this may be the last chance for this group of players, particularly Boozer and Deng.

**Anyone else have expectations to add?**

**Should I do more players?**

**Any Changes?**

2nd 0:45 - Nate update! He has a laceration on his upper lip.

2nd 0:00 - Time is up! Bulls are hustling for every play. Hope it continues through the next 24 minutes. Few things

4th :45.5 - Need i say more about what i just said? Nate is the man in the quarter.

(we may have liked Jordan

this season.  amazing win streak of Bulls victories over my Pistons.  the Pistons play good enough to win a couple of the last few, n8--you think you're such a badass).  

first game i get to take my son to this season (he's a rabid basketball fan--not necessarily just Pistons...to my chagrin, and were heading into an off-season filled with uncertainty.  beating the Bulls was the best thing that could have happened to a Pistons fan at the time given the circumstances.

anyway, and we see the Bulls, vastly undermanned, facing the Miami Heat.

i like LeBron James.  i don't see his moving to Miami as a 'strength' in his lore.  but i understand it.  and i feel it doesn't put him in the villain column by default.

but, the team deserves it more.  the Bulls can win this if they bring that swagger and physicality that defines them.  this team needs to emulate Nate Robinson's mentality and simply exert their will.

I know this is going to get down voted. I really don't care. But just know this: next year, just remember that when he was at his lowest point, he couldn't count on you to give him a break. You called him a ""selfish superstar"" questioning his hear and integrity. Remember that you, his hometown fan, don't have really have his back. You just like to say you do.

Derrick in practice Monday or Tuesday is going against Jimmy and Deng like they're Wade and lebron because thibs is trying to emulate how the Heat might guard point guards, exploding off his left foot for the vicious slam over Boozer, and then he realizes he wasn't thinking about anything (what knee?) but beating the heat the whole time. then tells the team ""I'm ready."" Thibs lets him know after practice ""I'll let you make the announcement."" D tweets ""i'm back"" comes back better than mvp form (ssj2) and now is ssj3. Noah also comes back (all-star, ssj1). They win out the rest of the year and grab the third seed ([Fuck the Knicks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZZUMjoxfZA)). Bulls breeze through the first two rounds of the playoffs ([pacers who?](http://i.minus.com/ipursZ5hkYOc7.gif)) then play the Heat in round 3. Rose and Noah do the fusion dance, becoming Derrickim Roah, a 6'11'' point forward all-around machine, posting the playoffs' first ever quadruple double and a series average of 40-12-11-5-2.

What should you do if you're Minnesota? If you're smart, the Jazz shrewdly dealt Deron Williams 17 months before he could bolt Utah for a high lottery pick (Derrick Favors) and a future lottery pick (that became no. 3 overall: Enes Kanter), maximizing any and all leverage they had. I don't see how the T-Wolves make it through this summer without doing the same. The likeliest suitor? Chicago. The Bulls have big contracts to make the trade work (Luol Deng on the enticing side, Carlos Boozer on the less enticing side); they're loaded with assets like Jimmy Butler (no. 49 on this year's list), the rights to Mirotic (a high lottery pick if he entered this year's draft), and the rights to Charlotte's future no. 1 pick (top-10 protected in 2014, top-eight protected in 2015

Let's say Chicago calls Minnesota in June and offers them Boozer's contract with Butler, and (b) upend a potential Miami dynasty with a nucleus of Rose, Noah, Love, Deng, Taj Gibson and Tom Thibodeau these next few years? You know, unless your owner was too cheap to make a real run at the Heat? (Cut to every Chicago fan grimacing.) Anyway,,False,t3_1d0fhw

1374295253.0,1ioghx,The myth of Coach Thibs not wanting to play rookies.,TLCplLogan,48,10,27,"So

Since Coach Thibs took over the team in the 2010-11 season

Omer Asik in 2010-11

During his rookie season, so he was a little more prepared than your average NBA rookie.

During his rookie season

1. As a result of the NBA lockout

2. Jimmy had four guys ahead of him on the depth chart this year. He had Luol Deng and Kyle Korver ahead of him at the SF position

In his rookie season

From all this information, Coach Thibs will not play them. 

I believe that Tom Thibodeau is a lot better at playing rookie talent than we give him credit for, Tony Snell should get a good amount of backup minutes at both SG and SF, and Erik Murphy should probably get the same amount of minutes that Jimmy and Marquis did during their rookie years, due to his lack of readiness and the talent ahead of him on the depth chart.

TL;DR Coach Thibs plays rookies when he can,False,self,t5_2s3uz,False,,drose-red,t3_1ioghx

Seeing how we've drafted and developed players these past few years makes me really optimistic to see how our team develops in the future and I think we can become a ""system team"" like the Spurs are now.

How do you want to see the Bulls develop in the future?  To be honest I don't want to trade for superstars and I would rather see us develop players and follow the Spurs model of team building.  If we can land a good backup center in the draft (Dieng, and we have Mirotic coming over who has superstar potential coupled with a possible #1 pick from the bobcats in 2016.

 But since that little incident, and being motivated by the benching. But it takes some serious cajones for Thibs to do that with confidence. That shows a coach who truly knows his personnel. That shows a coach who values the team more than his superstar. It's the difference between him and Spolstera, and it's the difference between The Bulls and most other teams.

&gt;**Q: In the words of the great philosopher Moses Malone

&gt;If Brooklyn beats Chicago in Game 7, it's DEFINITELY in play. But I think the Bulls will beat Brooklyn in Game 7, which means Miami isn't going Fo' Fo' Fo' Fo' — that's not happening on Tom Thibodeau's watch.

&gt;(Tangent: In general, I did it after watching Noah hobble around in Game 1 against the Nets. Every time I cross them off, I get burned. They're exceptionally well coached, they're as tough as anyone, they know exactly who they are — a crucial wrinkle, because you absolutely have to have an identity by May and June — they care about one another and they have immense pride. They carry themselves like former champs even though they haven't won a title yet. That's the highest praise you can give a team. And that's why I think they'll win Game 7 in Brooklyn.)

And sympathy for Rose in [part 2 of Bill Simmons' latest article](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9239387/thirty-questions-part-2):

&gt;**Q: Can you hold it against Derrick Rose for not coming back?**

&gt;Absolutely not. See

&gt;1. He's the first NBA star who tapped into the potential of connecting with fans on the Internet (with his groundbreaking Agent Zero blog). Then Twitter happened, and now we're at a point where Kobe could run for president because he's so good at social media. In fact, I think I'd vote for him in 2016. As long as he wasn't running with Dwight Howard.

&gt;2. After he bolted Golden State for the Wizards

&gt;3. They also named three unwritten rules after him: ""Don't bet large sums of money with teammates during poker games on chartered flights

&gt;4. He's the all-time ""came back too soon"" cautionary tale for anyone who suffered a major knee injury. Gilbert tore a meniscus near the tail end of the 2006-07 season, missed much of the season, came back too soon a second time, reinjured his knee in the playoffs, came back too soon the following fall, had a third surgery, and ended up playing 15 games total in two years. Make no mistake — he was NEVER the same.

&gt;Now? He's a cautionary tale, but as Magic tells it, you start feeling that pressure from every direction. Fans, teammates, coaches, the owner, you name it. And it's not even intentional. Might even be something as simple as someone saying,"" only they make eye contact for an extra second and you start thinking

&gt;As Magic put it, and fortunately, GILBERT ARENAS keeps flashing through his head in all caps. Over everything else, that's Arenas's real legacy. Nobody wants to be The Next Guy Who Came Back Too Soon.",,False,self,False,t3_1dqpyj

I LOVE the '10-'12 bench mob, I understand that it may be unfair, for the mental impact of losing your MVP in the very 1st game may be too overwhelming.

The reason why I loved the '12-'13 team is that they lost two of their leaders in Hinrich and Deng mid-series

I'm bummed that we will never test the team out and see if they can actually make a push for a title

Rose on the floor with either Marco or Nate. Maybe either of those two can be the 2nd shot creator that we need to ""take the load off"" of Rose.
