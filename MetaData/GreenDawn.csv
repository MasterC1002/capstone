Alright


Operation: LepreDawn


This operation's goal is to get a massive troop deployment out to as many bars as possible on March 16th. They've earned it. 

For those of you participating: get some nice shots of your troops placed strategically around local bars

*Please note the bars you visit and place troops at must be marked on the map.*


This comes also with a badge for participating in the operation 
(pending on if our CSS guys are able/willing to get this done since it might end up being a lot of work). Who wants a little shamrock badge next to their call sign?

So this Sunday

*Drink responsibly.*

I've noticed a lot of you slacking off around here lately


Welcome to Operation: Pickle Vs. Banana.


Pick your side. Do you prefer the crisp


Perhaps you like both? 

Too bad. For this operation


**Mission:** 

*  Invade local supply distributors (read: supermarkets


*  Place troops detaining/attacking the enemy in the same supermarket.


*  Do you keep a safe HQ? I know I do. Make sure there is a troop next to your pickle jar/banana hanger at home base.


Provide photographic evidence of these things in a post to comm base 001 Mike Delta ^^^/r/GreenDawn Charlie one-two


Our operations in the past have been swift deployments


**To The Victor Go The Spoils:** At the end of the battle


When posting recon photos


[Pickle] Bananas detained in Sector 1:541. VIVA LA PICKLE!!


or


[Banana] Pickle scum destroyed in S1:503. Better dead than a pickle lover!


Officers who have posted in favor of *both* sides in some sort of lame attempt to weasle into a promotion will be disqualified and recieve a **demerit


Also, blue soldiers out there (I even saw a pink one the other day. I'm...not really sure what kind of terrain he was camoflauged for, but that's not the point) they are just camoflauged for their mission. They're all green underneath, to the depths of their bones. They still sweat and bleed green, and just like those soldiers, all Bananas were green once, too


There are high ranking officers on both sides as well. I can assure you there has been no small amount of shit talking in the ~~mod mail~~ War Room while planning this operation.

Remember our **main objective* here: 

*  Strategically place soldiers **in the public**. Posts of an army man skewering a banana on your kitchen counter will **not** be counted for the competition. We are looking to hit the commisaries.


*  Have fun. If you're not enjoying destroying your enemy

**Note:** Admittedly, or [Vice Admiral Echo_Bravo](/u/euphoric_barley), he *loves* giving out ~~flair~~ rank promotions.


We may post updates here in case there is anything I've forgotten


Questions? Post them here. 


**Claim your side. Place your troops. Bring glory and victory to your team.**

**Ranking Promotion:** Updated 02/02/2013 0900 hrs.

If you are not posting, had a meeting at the war table last night and decided how exactly you may be promoted through the ranks of the Green Dawn Army. This is for initial promotions. Please note: Promotions to higher ranks will increase significantly in difficulty.

**CWO RANK PROMOTIONS:**

*Chief Warrant Officer 1:** Submit your first post to /r/GreenDawn. Must be of a troop in the public. Repost someone else's picture

*Chief Warrant Officer 2:* Post and document one full squadron (42 troops

*Chief Warrant Officer 3:* Targeting. We need to make sure we are securing key points of interest in our home towns. If we're not protecting our civilians

*  Post Office

*  Cour House/City Hall

*  Library

These must be in the same album and the three locations must be marked on the map.

*Chief Warrant Officer 4:* Before you reach the last level of CWO4 and get ready to achieve the respected rank of Ensign

*  *1:* Mark at least 20 of your troops on the map in the sidebar. You should be doing this for every troop you post

*  *2:* Document that a troop in the field has lasted 30 days. We need you to show us that you have learned the skills for placing troops stealthily. Throwing troops about all willy nilly is not recommended behaviour in our soldiers. 

**Please note:** These tasks can be combined. You can include the Targeting task force map placements in your 20 for CWO4. Your first troop placed in your initial squadron could be the one that lasts 30 days. That way, you cannot jump ranks. If you hit the Primary Targers for CWO3 but haven't deployed a whole squadron yet, you will not be jumped up.

Godspeed.

AFTER ACTION REPORT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING:

On the morning of January 18th, soldiers reported that one man (Pvt. Green) was MIA from the recon patrol. His partner *name withheld* was spotted in an overwatch position, but attempts to raise him on the radio were fruitless.

Command wasted no time in organizing a search and rescue operation. Before laying out a search pattern

*Name withheld* reported that at approximately 1400 hours on January the 25th, Pvt. Green was forced to surrender. *Name withheld* continued to observe as his partner was captured and transported to a holding facility kept under constant guard by the enemy.

Now knowing the location at which Pvt. Green was being held, with the goal of liberating Pvt. Green from his captors. At this time it was not known if Pvt. Green was still alive.

At 1502 hours, Pvt. Green was located, unconscious, and moved to the extraction point. He, along with the rescue squad, were safely extracted to a nearby field hospital where Pvt. Green was examined and found to bear signs of torture and malnourishment. He underwent immediate surgery, and, informed command that he had been tortured in an attempt to learn information about Operation Invisible Shield. He informed a relieved panel of officers that he had not compromised any information

In the face of extreme danger

*Name withheld* remains deployed and in cover. A reinforcement unit is scheduled to strengthen his grid sector tomorrow. Without the intelligence he gathered or the guidance he relayed to the rescue team

It's time for another mass deployment to commence. Thank you everyone who participated in our last one

April Fool's Day is in three days. What bether day to confound the world than to rain green army men upon them?

The main goal here is numbers. Those of you who get a full squadron out (42 troops) *on April 1st* and update the map with their location will recieve a rank promotion. You will also recieve a ribbon for your uniform that will signify participation in the op. If you put two squadrons out (and update the mapping center) we will bump you up two ranks. 

*Please note these rank promotions are only available to thouse still in CWO status. You cannot reach Ensign with these this op.*

The idea for Operation: Fool's Errand is to keep soldiers on you at all times as you go about your day

Getting some fuel? Leave some troops at the gas station. 

Grocery shopping? Army men gotta eat too.

Stopping by the liqour store? Our troops are known for their thirst

You get the idea. Carry as many on your person as you can

If you have any questions or thoughts

Some of the posts I've seen lately would be much better off if they were done on a street corner or at the shopping mall and left there rather than setup on the kitchen table and dismantled. 

Keep some army men in your car so they're always ready when the opportunity presents itself. Don't have a car? How about a bag or purse or backpack? The easiest way to place your troops is to always have some at your disposal and if they're always with you then there's no excuses.

November Oscar Golf reporting from Sector 1-512. My troops have been in reserve until a recent rash of hostile activity on our immediate borders. The trouble began when enemy spies dressed as carpenters were working on the roof and severed our comm link to Green Dawn. As a result I mustered the troops in order to secure our perimeter. Our base lies on a busy road, and have reported sighting enemy armor, which explains all the noise. My primary objective as of now is to fully secure the bridge, and if possible to have my scouts reach the enemy armor units South of the bridge.

1358099655.0,16hznh,Tips on Troop Placement,,24,5,7,"Okay

**1: SCOUT YOUR LOCATION**

This is the mot important tip, and think about it. Does it offer a good view of the enemy? Is it concealed well? Do people pass by it a lot? Can you access it easily? These are all questions you should ask before placing a troop.

**2: USE CAMOUFLAGE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE**

This is another important rule that is easily ignored. Choose your men wisely. Greens do well in forest or jungle conditions. Yellows do well in the desert or beach environment. Greys do well in urban locations. This isn't all to consider. Camouflage can be attributed to location as well. Placing a troop against a wall means it has a better chance of survival compared to open ground. Corners help, it's harder to see things in in the dark.

**3: SPREAD YOUR TROOPS OUT REASONABLY**

This is one of the least common mistakes, the enemy will be suspicious at first, and may look around for a short while. This can cause the enemy to notice things they normally wouldn't, and search vigorously in places they normally wouldn't. Normally, searches will be conducted around the immediate area where the troop is found. Troops far away from the action probably won't be spotted by the enemy. But if they are too far away, your forces can be spread thin, and it becomes impossible to track their statuses.

**4: MARK YOUR TROOPS**

Tisis one more closely followed rule, god forbid, fellow allies to identify killed troops. At the very least, you should put /r/greendawn on the base of your men. Personally, I prefer to carve mine in with knives, because the sharpie marks can wash/rub off sometimes. Besides, chicks dig scars. The carving will toughen your men up

Soldiers of the Green Dawn, there could be a total global war. Think of the possibilities! Custodial staff would only be a minor nuisance compared to hunting down enemy posts in your sector, using intel gathered through espionage on the opposing subreddit. Say you find an enemy, you capture him, and replace him with your own. Prisoner exchanges could be arranged. Battles could be fought! 

Really just curious about feedback on this idea. I'd go ahead and do it

P.S. A rule came to me as I was writing this; so we don't have a fight of 'I take yours then you take mine'

I found one of my men gravely injured on a desktop. Upon examination, external help came, and the injured troop was evacuated via call sign dustoff.

The medics did their best, he was rushed to surgery.

Quickly, and the open wound closed via causation. The surgery left him looking worse for wear, but it looks like he may walk again, at least.
The causation left large scars and marks across his body, once the all clear is given.

But onto more pressing matters. The soldiers, but only one large body fragment was found, and his body was strewn apart in an unnatural position. His legs were flung halfway across the room.

It appears we are dealing with a ruthless and savage enemy, as a war crime. Swift and immediate justice will be conducted. We will find those responsible, and we will kill him.

In the meantime, and deploy the commandos to find this monster and kill him? If we want justice, we have to take this risk. The men are all for it, fearless as ever, but I still am reps oils for them, and must make a rational and level headed desicions.

**DECRYPT START**

**PROCESSING...**

**DECRYPT SUCCESS!**

**TRANSMISSION START**

Apologies from CWO Charlie Sierra. The encryption of the report was necessary as a top level of secrecy is needed to conceal the sensitive information from prying eyes. After the transmission is finished

Also, (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta) To recap, the previous teams, Alpha and Bravo, set up a FOB and secured the foward perimeter.

At 1000 hours this morning, establish a rear guard for FOB Alpha, Provide intel on the whereabouts of the three MIA soldiers (An increase from just the one last report), and station a fireteam at waypoint Alpha (the main road outside).

At 1000 hours, the men had orders to notify me.

At 1240 hours

By 1630 hours, a fireteam had established a recon link on the main road. Hopefully, this new development will prevent father soldiers from going MIA.

Tomorrow, they will spread out in the most secure areas, and provide any intel on the enemy, and the whereabouts of the three MIA soldiers.

List of casualties:

Codename Gunslier

Codename Coyote

Codename Lincon

Codename Wolfenstein

Men deployed: 48

This is Charlie ""Haggard"" Sierra singing off. Over and out.

**TRANSMISSION START**

At 0830 hours the mission officially started, the first part of the plan was put into action. Team alpha was strategically inserted into position, and constructed a small foward operating base.

At 1500 hours, and attempted to tap into the server network connection via cable. However, one soldier fell down on the cable, knocking out any hope of inter and intra net surveillance. An immediate and risky extraction was conducted, and the scout was retrieved minus injuries. Although electronically IT surveillance was now put of the question. I reassigned the scouts to a more concealed, low-down position and requested that they provide any IT related visuals to me. In the future, more rigarous risk assessments will have to be made.

At 1530 hours, and the soldiers may only engage in fire only if fired upon, as we don't have enough intel on the enemy yet. Currently, it is unknown if they are aware of our presence even.

Due to unforeseen circumstances

In summary, and visual IT intel is being relayed back to me in real time. As of current, the 12 men deployed are active.

For my next target

Charlie Sierra

Alright soldiers. You may or may not have heard that reddit's Best Of 2012 is a little bit different this year. I can tell you this much: we will be having categories for Best Of specifically in this sub. Winners will **most likely** receive reddit gold. I can't tell you what all of the categories are, you will be assigned a medal in your flair, a badge you will wear to show the honor in your dedication to the cause.

You might be thinking

As you all know, but there is still almost a whole month left to get posts in. This is going to make our Best Of a bit different than other subs. So get out there and keep up the good work. Most importantly, have fun. That's what this revolution is all about.

**TRANSMISSION START**

At 0800 hours a member of the Charlie team took up posts on the local bus stop. His mission is to relay any incoming enemy transport activity

At 0830 hours

From 0830 hours to 1050 hours, four of the five members of Charlie team were posted outside the design block. Their mission is to provide overwatch and intel for the upcoming invasion tomorrow.

At 1100 hours, but not well defendable. Because he was only conducting recon, this was thought not to be a problem.

At 1145 hours, and the information that Gunslinger has gone MIA was posted to the four squads that consisted of the newly designated alpha company. Due to the nature of the mission, a search and rescue can only be conducted tomorrow at 0730 hours from the earliest.

It is unlikely, then he is most certainly a POW, with no chance of him being retrieved in the foreseeable future. However, if capture by a teacher, then he may be treated well, assuming that they don't bin him.

It saddens me that I chose such a poor position for Gunslinger, and his family in fort freedom will be notified.

If any of you see Gunslinger in your local place of study, he green colour, his crouching stance and his sniper rifle. He is most likely indoors somewhere in a design and technology block, and if not, immediately outside the block. 

If he isn't found within 72 hours, lent only a friend and family member. I can only imagine what his friends and family are going through at this point, all due to my poor desicions. In war, there will always be causalities, but everything must be done to ensure tha they are kept to a minimum.
