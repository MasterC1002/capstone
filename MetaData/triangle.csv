For the past couple years I've been working on starting [The Brothers Vilgalys Spirits Company](http://brothersvilgalys.com/) in my hometown of Durham. Now after lots of red tape and losing a lot of money

I'm making something called Krupnikas, and a neutral spirit (basically vodka) base. The final product is a smooth sipping liqueur that's great on its own, or goes very well in all sorts of cocktails. I wish I could've made it out in time for Christmas, but New Years isn't a bad occasion either, right?

Today is our first day on shelves, NC Code 66256, it couldn't hurt our chances :)

News and other stuff always goes on my [facebook thing](http://www.facebook.com/BrothersVilgalysSpirits). We have a twitter (@brosvilgalys) but I still don't understand what twitter does

Happy to answer any questions here

-Rim Vilgalys

(* assuming you're a responsible adult over the legal drinking age).

**Edit: Looks like we sold out on the first day! Thanks to everyone who bought some and I will try to get it back on the shelves over there soon!**

We are starting our second week in business and really want to get people knowing about us since we're a little off the beaten path. It's a contemporary coffee shop with a bamboo garden, koy pond and live entertainment stage. We sell fair-trade coffee, pastries from a local bakery, wine from NC and Italy and beer. It's a great and beautiful place to come spend an afternoon, study or go on a date. There really isn't any place like it in the area. Our current hours are Tues.-Sat. 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sun. &amp; Mon. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. We plan on extending our hours from 7 a.m. through 11 p.m. once we get more of a following. You can find us on facebook or follow us on twitter (username StrawValleyCafe).

So, if you come in any time from today (10/10) through Friday (10/15) and tell the barista you are from reddit, you get free drip coffee. Also, on Nov. 4th, we are hosting a free wine tasting at 6 pm.

Thanks all for reading my long-winded post

**Edit** Wow guys! This has only been posted for a day and the number of redditors who've come in along with all the positive feedback and support has really exceeded my expectations! We all really appreciate it over here at the cafe and I hope you grow to love this place as much as we do. Also, and I will make an official post about that shortly.

The NC GOP has taken every opportunity to introduce bills this session that are about as right-wing as you can get. They have introduced several bills that made national headlines, to [reduce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/H451) the [voting](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S428) [rights](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S666) [of](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S721) [our](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S668) [citizens](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S667), and to [impose a 2-year waiting period for divorce](http://legiscan.com/NC/bill/S518). They have [arrested peaceful protesters protesting these exact issues](http://www.wral.com/49-arrested-at-moral-monday-protest-at-state-legislature-/12441971). 

This will not do. We need to do something about this. Whether you are republican, something needs to change. 


So

**Run for office. Run as a democrat. Run as a republican. Just run.**


As of 5-13-13,432,830 registered voters in North Carolina. Breakdown is as follows: 2,764,896 Democrats, 1,982, 20,494 Unaffiliated. Only taking into account the two major parties

**People didn’t vote.**

* Not in the numbers they should. 
Of the 7.5 million people old enough to vote, with only 2.7 Million voting. --[Numbers come from NC BoE](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?ID=70)--

**People didn’t run.**




* There were at least [24 seats in the state house](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012). (It is entirely possible that I missed a few)

**Senate seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 6 	– (Jones

District 10    – (Duplin

District 29 	– (Moore

District 33 	– (Davidson

District 34 	– (Davie

District 35 	– (Union) – Tommy Tucker (R)

District 36 	– (Cabarrus

District 41 	– (Mecklenburg) – Jeff Tarte (R)

District 43 	– (Gaston) – Kathy Harrington (R)

District 48 	– (Henderson) – Tom Apodaca (R)

**House seats where Republicans ran unopposed in the general election of 2012:**

District 14	– (Onslow) - George Cleveland (R)

District 15 	– (Onslow) - Phillip Shepard (R)

District 111	 – (Cleveland) - Tim Moore (R) 

District 117	 – (Henderson) - Chuck McGrady (R) 

District 120	 – (Cherokee, Macon) - Roger West (R)	

There are 50 state senate seats and 120 state representative seats available. Yes, you are not guaranteed a win, but **you can be part of a show of force.** Let the NCGA know that we, the people of North Carolina will not stand for this.

You don't have to run for the General Assembly, or County Commissioner. As long as you run. [Filing for municipal elections begins July 5th, and ends July 19th](http://www.ncsbe.gov/content.aspx?id=61&amp;s=4)

**People aren’t involved enough.**

* I recently went to the Democratic Party Convention for my county. There were, I do live in a county that leans Republican, but that seems like little excuse for only 15 people. 

We need more people to get involved. Find a chapter of [Young Democrats](http://www.ydnc.org/) or [Young Republicans](http://www.ncfypr.com/associations.shtml) (If you are under 35 or 40, and ask them what you can do. Let them know that you plan on running.

-------

We have an opportunity coming up. We have a chance to tell the right-wing crazies that their legislation is not welcome here. We need to get them out of office. We need to get involved now. A good

2014 is right around the corner.

I found this girl today on Falls Lake Trail

I was walking with my dog up there and she ran up to us. Lots of off-leash dogs on the trails so I assumed the owners were nearby. She came right up to me and was rubbing on me and a bit jumpy but friendly. I walked her down the trail in the direction she came from for about 15 minutes

As I got a better look at her, and her ears were in rough shape. Pretty obvious she'd been outdoors for a few days.

She has a red collar with no tags. She was taken to a local vet who could not find a microchip. 

I've given her a bath

I'll be crossposting to craigslist

She's an absolute sweetheart


Edit: UPDATE Monday 6/17 11:30am

She's at a vet right now getting the ticks removed and cleaned up. My plan is to take her to the Wake Co shelter late this afternoon

Warning: Wall of Text",pinkmanbitch,45,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/1i3glt/noticed_lots_of_questions_about_moving_to_area/

1. Don't ever ask a Southern how they are doing if you don't have a good 20 minutes to spare. You will get their whole life story. We like to talk and we talk slow.

2. Coleslaw is a condiment here it goes on top of your pulled pork and BBQ is a noun not a verb. We never have BBQs we have cook outs or pig pickins'.

3. When you drive through older neighborhoods people will wave at you. People you don't even know. I'm not sure why this happens. My suggestion is to wave back with all 5 fingers.

4. Always hold doors for other people. This is a must in the South not only because it's polite but because we are all armed.

5. The use of the word ""fixin"" means preparing to do

6. It is hot as fuck here in the summer. Like liquid fucking heat. If you have problem with hair frizzies like I do

7. When driving around our beautiful rural areas and in need of directions choose your establishment wisely. Ask yourself these questions: How many cars in the parking lot have the following things? 1. Confederate Flags 2. Deer carcasses in the flatbed 3. Harleys with ""The Bitch Fell Off"" stickers If you answered one or more to any of these questions keep driving and consider purchasing a GPS.

8. Tea comes in Sweet or Sweeter here and it's just called Tea if you want an Unsweetened Ice Tea then you are going to need to order it just like that. Be prepared for the perplexed looks when you do request it. Don't even bother asking for hot tea; the waiter's head will explode

9. There is nothing more terrifying or awe inspiring to us Southerners as the occasional snow fall. Your whole town will come to a complete stand still until every single flake has completely melted. It is like a surprise holiday for us.If there is talk of snow go immediately to the grocery store and purchase all the eggs. milk and bread you can lay your hands on. I don't know why. No one has explained this phenomenon to me. But as a Southerner I am duty bound to clear the aisles of Harris Teeter just in case I'm stuck in the house and need to make french toast for everyone in the neighborhood.  Southerners also have a special treat called snow cream that Grandpops like to make. I have never had any but I do know the recipe and will share it with you.
-Take some snow that your dog hasn't peed in
-Put snow in bowl mix with milk and sugar
-Enjoy
Or you could just pour yourself a vodka drink instead which is usually what I opt for when forced to spend the whole day trapped in the house with my family.

10. Southerners pride themselves on being polite. We are a friendly people but just like anywhere there are exceptions to the rule. So it's good to keep a few 4 letter bombs up your sleeve for a rainy day. There is nothing like running into a grumpy redneck and laying him out with a few eff bombs and C U next Tuesdays
So in closing Welcome to the South y'all! Have Fun!

Two and a half years ago, and he quickly found a home with us. We called him Opie.

We didn't know who Opie's parents were. There are too many feral dogs roaming in our rural county

Then, and toward the end of Opie's first summer, he succeeded. This effort was made in the belief that this dog was Opie's father, a pretty fair assessment given some similarities between them.

We dubbed Opie's dad Zeke. Zeke became a fixture around the yard

He was

And she was pregnant.

And lo, who doesn't love a cute puppy.

But, and four siblings: Fatty, BoBo, Princess, and Lyddie. Six dogs. That number has grown to eight as unscrupulous neighbors have dumped not one, but TWO bedraggled pit bulls in our yard. I suppose we got a reputation for actually taking care of the animals. 

Herein lies our current situation. My brother, and my brother will be able to take Opie and Sneakers with him when he moves. I have personally adopted one of the siblings, Lyddie. She's a great dog. Very sweet disposition, loves the cuddle, just like her brothers. 

I have tried, but we're running out of options. This is not a case of adopting puppies without understanding the work entailed in raising them. It is a case of trying to do the right thing by them and find them homes.

I am appealing to you, please consider one of these happy boys: BoBo and Fatty. 

They are two years old, used to being on a leash, and very playful. They are not aggressive, and are house trained. All they want is a good home. We wish they could stay with us, but we just can't keep them anymore.

For months now my Internet will randomly drop and come back up, they schedule a technician for me today who refused to come out because it's an ""area wide outage"". I've heard that excuse a thousand times now and these higher level technicians are telling me I have a specific problem while the local office refuses to fix it. At this point I'm even looking to just drop them entirely. I've looked into Frontier

tl;dr TWC refuses to fix my problem. Anyone with experience know who to call to get things done or have suggestions for other ISPs?



Edit: Well it is a relief to see I'm not the only one that's having this issue. I'm on the phone with their sales team asking for credit back for this month and a price of only cable if they can't fix this Internet or I'm dropping their service.

Edit 2: well Uverse isn't available at my house so not sure what I'm going to do. I'm am getting ready right now to go down to the local time Warner office and complain. I ask all of you who are also customers to find some time in this next week to go down and complain. They will only solve this if we show that we will not stand for it. The third technician (2 have cancelled on me when I've stayed home waiting) just left and I've already had 3 drops in my Internet. This is just unacceptable.  I've contacted WRAL to let them know and if anyone has any contacts within the company or other news agencies

Edit 3: Complaining has gotten me a month of my bill back at least. Call the sales team 1 (877) 566-4892 or go to the customer service building and push that you want that. Got about 3 supervisors on the issue to try and get someone to fix this.

I'm 30, I went through a period of depression (for no particular reason - I kind of suspect it was [SAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder)) and basically let my apartment go to crap. I'd like to find someone willing to help^* get it back in order, and also keep an eye on me to make sure I get back in the right habits again (which I haven't even though I'm feeling better now - I'm not good at making or keeping habits in any case). I'd also like some help getting into the habit of going out and doing things on a regular basis, which I think might help my brain in general - my overall level of functionality has pretty much taken a nosedive since I started working from home three years ago and basically stopped leaving the house except when it's necessary (without an enforced deadline the effort of getting ready makes 'eh, I'll do it later' the more attractive option, even for fun stuff). I think one person could handle both of those - spend one day a week with me, spend the first couple weeks just cleaning, but if it has to be split up

I don't like crowds or very loud places, but I haven't actually made it to an open house yet so I don't actually know if it will work at all. I also very much like animals, and have a cat. I don't drive but do live on a bus line and don't object to paying for the occasional taxi.

I am willing to pay for this, and I'd rather not have someone who's primarily in it for the money anyway... eh. PM me if it sounds interesting, or if you know someone who would be interested, and we'll work something out.

For those of you that missed last time, and since the Armory is being nice enough to host these meetups for us, I'd like to see if we can't patronize them by buying some stuff! They're really awesome people and deserve to have their store become super successful (also consider purchasing any TCG cards or board games or miniatures from them as well).

This time around, let me know. We'd need to set some rules of course, but nobody I met last time was particularly weird or creepy so I don't think I'd have a problem with it (now to convince my four roommates it's okay).

The bike looks like this:

* Older steel Red Koga Miyata Terra Liner (58cm)
* Black (steel) fork
* Old, B17 brooks saddle
* Campagnolo Record 9s shifters (carbon fiber/black)
* Black
* An aluminium rear rack
* A ""Randunneur USA"" top tube sticker
* Speedplay Frogs pedal system
* A B+M light
* A custom made, but rather a useful identifier)
* A steel
* The seatpost is funny/unique

* The first ever official brevet of China.
* And all over NC.

While he rode it for a number of years (he picked it up circa 2001)

Here are pics of the famous Yo Adrian! (my Dad) riding the red Miyata:

When you turn us on today

How did we come up with the music mix on Radio 96.1? 

Well, what they wanted to hear on their favorite radio station. The result was a much wider variety of rock music than we ever imagined playing on one radio station. 

You told us you wanted to hear a greater diversity of songs with music spanning from the 80s with artists such as Guns N Roses, to Classic Rock from Led Zeppelin, Steve Miller Band and Aerosmith and even some newer music by artists like Nickelback and Linkin Park.

You also said you wanted to hear A LOT more music

So ... give us a listen and tell us how we're doing.  You can call 919-860-9600 or post your thoughts on Facebook.

Thanks again for helping us build a better Radio 96.1.

So the plan is Saturday we're going bowling. In order to have reservations at Sparians, food will be about $9-12, assuming you get soda. If we eat and play, it'd probably be 3 hours and $30 minimum.

Hopefully some kind souls around here might can help!,Mekeri,20,4,3,"I have been fostering a puppy named Tiger Lily for the past month or so. She is an absolute sweetheart who is looking for her forever home. She is having a harder time than most puppies we rescue due to her disability. 

The only the background on her we have is that she was thrown over a fence into someone's backyard. When she was found she had little to no control over her back legs. The doctor thinks it was probably some type of birth defect but it could have been a injury when she was very young. She seems to have no pain associated with this injury.

We have had her for a little over a month now and to our amazement she has been getting better and better. She now can stand and even walk a bit on slick hardwood floors. She is still pretty wobbly but we have been amazed at her progress. She will still drag her little butt around when she is in a hurry somewhere but she is very mobile and has tons of puppy energy and love!

The rescue group I work with is based in Rougemont which is a bit north of Durham. Here is a link to the rescue and also a link to Tiger Lily's adoption page.

[WSJ Article about Barcraft](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904070604576516462736084234.html) 

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, and there's still plenty of rough spots

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,t5_2qht2,True

I'm a Raleigh native so I don't know too much about Durham and CH. I need your help filling out the list. The goal is to make a sticky post for people who are visiting or curious about our towns. Here's what we have so far

**RALEIGH**

**Bars**

* **The Big Venue: The Lincoln Theatre** The biggest music bar in Raleigh, it's hard to say what will be at the Lincoln one night to the next. That said, they are the most consistant at booking bands everyone has heard of.
* **The Little Venue: Kings/Neptunes/The Pour House** Kings and Neptunes is split level bar that caters to the indie scene. Not a huge space, you can bet your ass it's hipster gold. The Pour House is a bit more... hippie? It's got a great scene and works very hard to bring good bands to the triangle.
* **The Townies: Slims/Dive Bar** Both are the hole in the wall bars where you'll get a new best fried and/or stabbed. Slims caters to the local music scene while Dive Bar caters to the heavy metal crowd. Both seem kind of scary from the outside
* **The Gay Bars: The Borough/Legends/Flex** The borough offers LGBT friendly dining. I've never seen that place get crazy nor have I ever felt uncomfortable there for being straight, queens, and much crotch grabbing. Maybe that was just the night I was there, but from what I understand, that's what it's generally like (correct me if I'm wrong)
* **The Beer Garden: Flying Sucer/The Raleigh Times** Both are water holes. The Flying Saucer has hundreds of beers on tap and in bottles
* **I JUST WANT TO DANCE: Mirage/Architecture/Solas/Red Room/The Hive** These are the bars where you go to get down. Loud music and expensive drinks are on order for the evening. If you go to these bars
* **Pubs: Tir Na Nog/Landmark Tavern/Mitch's Tavern** Really chill places to get a pint and chill with friends.
* **See and be Scene: Glennwood South/Fayetteville Street** Put on your best outfit
* **Billiards/Pool Hall: Buck's Billiards/Snooker's/Pantana Bob's/Sharky's** Although Buck's is technically in Cary it's one of the best place that's close to downtown to play pool, granted you tend to get more of the college crowd there prob due to it being on hillsborough st. Oh and there's Sharky's, they just recently came under new ownership and i believe they also have new tables. Talk about great food and drink specials.
* **Munchies: Snoopy's/Char-Grill/Mecca/Most Bars** Bars close at 2 am. at 2:01, most delicious drunk food you'll be able to get your hands on. Mecca closes when it runs out of food or the cooks feel like cleaning up, but it's worth it to get there early. Great diner food. Most places on this list will serve food (especially the pubs) and most of the food is great.

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, and there's still plenty of rough spots

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.

So I'll be moving to the Triangle in a few weeks after having spent most of my life in Central California. I also spent 2.5 years in San Antonio, and I'd still take that any day over the 110° it was here in the Valley last weekend.

I'll be living with friends in Durham to begin with, so I'd like to end up living somewhere around there. 

I've been told that things tend to work a lot slower than they do in California. I'm used to things working at a very fast pace

Central California is what I refer to as the Bible Belt of California, so I doubt either of those things will bother me either.

I'm a big sports fan

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Our goal is to make stops in Asheville, and a little stop here and there (dates soon) but we will definitely be in the Research Triangle. 

If you are interested in being our next breakfast please email us at: breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Triangle' in the subject line. 


**More details about our project**

On July 18, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027


**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute).

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, and there's still plenty of rough spots

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,t5_2qht2,True

Hello fellow North Carolinians

My company, Oct 29** at the [Aviator Brewery](http://www.aviatorbrew.com/brewery) in Fuquay-Varina, NC. The brewery opens at **3pm** and we'll be getting started shortly thereafter; if you want to plan on being there by 3:30 we'll be kicking things into gear around then and going til late into the evening. Everyone will be enjoying fine handcrafted Savinelli Nicaraguan cigars from a local cigar company paired with the excellent (usually hoppy) craft-brewed Aviator brews. There is no cover charge, just the cost of any beer or cigars you choose to enjoy. Also there will also be at least one sort of little contest going on involving free boxes of cigars or growlers of beer, or both! 

 The event has been severely underpublicized and I'm trying to spread the word now. Gonna go hit /cigars and /beer next. 

Cheers! (especially to those of you lighting up our sticks tonight!)

It's a late night Barcraft, that means we'll be Barcrafting it up pretty late - it depends on how well the players cooperate, but we could easily be going into the wee hours of the morning with this thing ;) This is looking to be one of the last events of the year we'll be able to Barcraft, so make sure to make it out if you can!


The GSL Finals themselves are shaping up to be quite the event, finally making it (almost) all the way, and MVP_Sniper, a solid Zerg player who simply has never managed to shine, until now. And we have two Terrans - STX_INnoVation, a solid Terran player from the KESPA teams, one of TL's elephants in the room, another absolutely rock solid Terran who's also never managed to make it this far into the GSL tournament

 All four of these players could take the Code S trophy, but we've got a semi-finals and potentially a grand finals harking back to the original days of the GSL and the many great battles between Terran and Zerg opponents in their finals.


The schedule for the Barcraft should be:
9:30PM - Initial set up and streaming.
10PM - Start watching some of the GSL World All-Stars tournament from 10PM-11PM as a warmup.
11PM - The GSL Code S Finals begin!

**Introduction to Barcraft**

So what is a Barcraft? A Barcraft is an event where you watch StarCraft II competitions in a bar, where professional gamers battle it out in the virtual arena of a video game. 

Now, and I still find it somewhat unreal), but there are people that are, in fact, 'professional' gamers. Their main source of income is from competing as a pro-gamer, and it is their job - they practice 8-10 hours a day with other pro-gamers and with the aid of their coaches. These gamers almost always belong to a team , which is an organization with all of the same structure you'd expect from any other sports organization, and there's still plenty of rough spots

StarCraft II itself is a 'real-time strategy game', while the real-time aspect forces high speed and precision (known as APM, or Actions Per Minute). Unlike other games, the player plays a dual-role of both managing their army in battle, as well as building up the army and choosing its composition back at base.",,False,t5_2qht2,True

2. If anyone uses a tailor

3. I want to know what streets and bars are worth hitting. For the record I prefer the price of ""$2 domestic"" bars, many more here.

4. What are some fun things to do during the weekend that don't involve shopping? I'll do enough of that

5. What areas should I avoid entirely? 

6. Where is the best place other than bars or church for a single 22.5 year old guy to meet friends and girls?

* That's probably enough for now. I'm sure I'll think of more later.

In any case, worked a lame job for a lot of that, finally got a break and got several interviews and offers, and took one for a large insurance company here in Raleigh.

Faith is the youngest and boy does she have an attitude. She also responds to every other name then her own. She will snuggle and play around, but she does like to start trouble. She also can't have any doors closed on her, unless they've always been closed for boundaries, or she'll scratch the rug until you let her in. She can be a little trouble, but boy is she sweet. She also jumps up on light switches until they are in the ""off"" position.

Wingnut is shy and fluffy. She will sit in the hallway like a Buddha statue and just purr. She sleeps with her paws in the air and be the laziest thing in the world

All three of them enjoy an open window and a place to lay by that open window. They don't dig-up furniture, but they all do about the same together or alone. I love them so much and I just want them to find a good home or homes. Thank you.",,False,,t5_2qht2,False,,

Looking for thoughts/reviews/etc of the local strip clubs. My only experience is with 2 trips to ~~Thee Dollhouse~~ The Men's Club about 5 years ago. I was relatively happy with it.

I'll (hopefully) be celebrating something in about 6 months. I'd like to hear some suggestions about the local establishments. Here's a few things on my list:

* Cover fee doesn't really won't bother me
* I probably will only buy a drink or three
* I'm not trying to ""pull"" a girl from the joint. Just there for an hour or two's worth of fun.

I recently moved to Oakland from the southeast and can't afford a round-trip flight to pick her up and don't want to send her cargo


If you know of any flight attendants or any people flying RDU to any airport within two or three hours drive of Oakland (SFO, SAC, and beyond), any help would be greatly appreciated. Her owner would meet you at RDU with Trinity in a soft-side carrier, and you would only need to take her through security and on the flight. I would meet you at the airport to pick her up, and could drive you wherever you needed to go within a reasonable distance (better than a cab, I suppose).


I can pay the fee to fly her in-cabin as well as $100 to compensate her courier for their troubles.

&gt;Everyone chill the fuck out. We got this. Saturday the 18th of December, drunk go-karting...drunk...and...and so...I dunno never been there but sounds awesome and it's all ages. Google it. Let's do this.


[This](http://www.frankiesfunpark.com/raleigh/) is that Frankie's place where the meet up could potentially be. It's in the Brier Creek area, so that should be kept in mind. **EDIT: They have an in-house restaurant, I'm not sure what the hours are. I'm assuming it's the same as the entire, um, fun park? Still no alcohol there though for the 21+ crowd**

Use this thread to discuss times

**Edit 2: It now appears that the general consensus is no on the Frankie front. There seems to be a lot of interest in seeing Philthy42 perform at Comedyworx though! So,,False,,t5_2qht2,True,,True

Ask your dorky college friends if they need to move out of their parents' house. Or your recently-separated buddy that's been crashing on your couch. Or just ask yourself

Oh, you'll have to bring one, and you'll need your own bed, naturally. I also have a long table we've been using as our computer desk, so if you don't have one and you show enough interest by the 18th, I can arrange to keep the table, too.

I may or may not be able to make it (still working out vacation plans) but if anyone can't attend, I'm happy to loan out my little alien sign if anyone is willing to feed &amp; clean up after him)

I had originally planned to host it at [Lone Rider Brewery](http://www.loneriderbeer.com/) but after thinking about it, otherwise still a very cool spot though.

So my proposal is this;  
1) Post your favorite Raleigh venue (maybe with a brief description on why it is awesome!)

2) Whichever venue has the most upvotes one week from today (7/26) will be the chosen spot and we can start another thread to talk specifics.  

Sound like a plan?  Btw
