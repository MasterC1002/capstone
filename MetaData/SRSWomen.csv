Then he starts talking to me, and its blatantly obvious that he got all of his ""how to talk to random women"" ideas from PUAs. I'm trying to ignore him, but he won't shut up.

I perk up, but with a little ""No no, who do you think everyone hates there? Really hates"" he finally answers SRS.

I didn't report him to management because this guy is smart

On a lunch break a week or so later, ""Do you believe that on a fundamental level, I'm as capable of doing this job as you?"".. He says yes. So I go on and ask, ""Do you think our pay should hinge on what we do, or should our genders be factored in?""... What we do of course, he said. ""Should men be treated one way, and women another?"" And he said no

""You're a feminist

He was shocked and a little angry at me, I have a husband and son, both whom I adore, both are men. Feminism is not the hatred of men, nor will it ever be.

This afternoon as our shift ended he asked if I'd talk with him over lunch. We went to lunch and had a long discussion about feminism, ""We've really made feminist into a bad word, haven't we?""

He was lamenting about how he can't get a woman who isn't ""nuts"" or immature blah blah and I told him that no mature woman is gonna go for a dude who lives in moms basement with no direction in life. Harsh? Sure. True? Absolutely. I mean, knocked me out (I was shocked, I played hockey my whole life and that is the only time I knocked out from a punch) and raped me.](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Boy-That-Escalated-Quickly-Anchorman.gif) I eventually fought him off and left. He was a very meek, very introverted dude. Not the ""type"" to rape. Yeah right. 

It went unreported. Of course. The problem was that I was having a shitty time at home, right? 

So

I grew up in Chicago. The bars and clubs were plentiful and so were fake IDs. I was 20, enjoying a blunt, when all of a sudden, I see Mr. Rapey. 

I tried to ignore him. I really did. I got this feeling of rage in my gut and I tried to turn away. He talked to me. I tried to pretend like I didn't know who he was. Then he crosses the line. You see, heels, hair did, the works. So this fuck face says to me ""Ugh look at your face. Did your pimp over there beat the shit out of you?""

I had enough. I was already pumped full of adrenaline. I punched him in the jaw so hard it knocked him over. I kicked him. I spit on him. I really let the fucker have it. I was wearing my favorite Louboutins, I'm being pulled off of him by cops but he looked pretty bad. I thought ""Well, this is it. My first assault charge. Worth it."" 

So a few minutes later, the police are talking to him, my buddies, and all the people around us. My friends have ZERO idea why I snapped like that. If they knew, I know the dude would have ended him. He's like my big brother. But I wanted this asshole to myself. There was no way I could make him feel as violated as he made me, but at least I know he had some new scars to show off. 

Some time passes and I'm told by an officer that he won't be pressing charges. The officer, that I regretfully didn't report it, and that I tried to ignore him that night but he just wouldn't stop provoking me. I also let her know that I KNOW kicking someones ass doesn't solve anything but it made me feel better so the charge would have been worth it. I swear she held back a laugh. 

She asks me if I want to go home. I do. I'm covered in blood and my make up is smeared from crying and screaming and general freaking out. She uncuffs me and I ride backseat

I get home and it's still early. Midnight on a Friday is early in Chicago. I shower off,,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,True

The post is a response to [this picture](/http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0g0aqlXVt1r9inq9o1_500.jpg) and the many reblogs and likes it received.



&gt;    Testing. 1
&gt;
&gt;    I was taking a break from writing a post about introducing D/s to a vanilla relationship when I came across this image. I sat and looked at it for a moment trying to sort out exactly what it evoked within me. Then I looked at the notes.
&gt;
&gt;    At the time of this post 13
&gt;
&gt;    So, a bit of righteous indignation and the like. Nope. Like, after like. Reblog after reblog. I gave up after scrolling through four pages of notes and not finding even one comment saying “What the fuck is this?”
&gt;
&gt;    I am not easily offended. I get off on the weirdest and kinkiest shit. I really don’t care what two consenting people do to each other
&gt;
&gt;    However
&gt;
&gt;    This week here in Melbourne, disappeared from the street, only to be found a few days later buried in a shallow grave on a dirt road outside of the city. She had been raped and then murdered. 
&gt;
&gt;    What could she have done to have kept her assault simply a rape instead of her murder as well? Did she fail to remain calm? 
&gt;
&gt;    In 2008, as he’d been physically abusive in the past and I chose to meet him at a neutral location (a friend’s apartment). I knew better, but there were drugs involved, and at the time, I was in a bad place and risked common sense for a need. Bad choice? yes. Consent to horror? No.
&gt;
&gt;    He brought a friend to ‘teach me a lesson.’ My boyfriend sat on the sofa, tried to keep breathing, focused on surviving, looked into my ex-boyfriend’s eyes and plead for help.
&gt;
&gt;    When M., Colin took his turn.  He was high on coke and more violent than I’d ever seen him. I was barely conscious when the police kicked down the door. The two men went to jail, I was taken by ambulance to the hospital with a number of significant injuries. 
&gt;
&gt;    Colin had the audacity to say aloud to me as the gurney was being taken from the apartment
&gt;
&gt;    His message was perfectly clear
&gt;
&gt;    I know that had a tactical team of cops with rifles and shotguns not broken down that door and stopped what was happening that my rape would have turned into a murder no matter how calm I had or hadn’t remained.
&gt;
&gt;    Oh
&gt;
&gt;    Nah, at times I have a chuckle when I really really shouldn’t. I’m not really that much of a buzz kill.
&gt;
&gt;    So why am I getting torqued over a stupid t-shirt that isn’t really supposed to literally be taken as about real rape
&gt;
&gt;    Well
&gt;
&gt;    Rape isn’t a joke. Murder even less so. There have been times when I think I would have been better served to have died on the living room floor of a friend’s apartment with my face bashed in and my ribs bashed
&gt;
&gt;    I hadn’t even gotten to the place in my life at that time that would turn out to be the worst
&gt;
&gt;    Yeah
&gt;
&gt;    What gets me about this post is the likes and reblogs. The number of them that appear to be women who are reblogging this. I am gobsmacked.
&gt;
&gt;    It is sexist, but a fair number who have no earthly idea about the experience of abject fear and terror, of hanging on to every moment not knowing if it is soon to be your last. Of that secret hope that it would just end, be over with, that the murder would free you of your fear and your pain and the horror of what was happening.
&gt;
&gt;    But women? I really don’t understand that in the least. Someone kindly explain what is ‘likeable’ about his image. Seriously. Please do.
&gt;
&gt;    If anyone thinks that in addition to it being a woman’s responsibility to not get herself raped in the first place, here’s a thought for you - go fuck yourself.
&gt;
&gt;    And no, I won’t fucking take a joke.
&gt;
&gt;    I will speak up for myself, begged, plead their way through a rape, hoping against all odds that it wouldn’t turn into a murder or possibly that they wished the murder would come quickly to save them from the awful reality of what they were enduring.

I am sure you could ask any woman on the street if they have experienced sexual harassment while going about their business in New York and hear a similar story. And my story, while using sexually aggressive language that was neither asked for nor welcome.


**""Fuck off""**

  
This was my response. Concise, but I have always liked the rain. I had no issue waiting outside for my friend. I have every right to spend time in the public sphere without fear of harassment or violence. But this is not reality.

*""B-tch

In an instant, every single word I have ever read by Selma James, Judith Butler, Wendy Brown, Simone de Beauvoir, Catherine MacKinnon and so many others came over me in a rush. But the one question that blared in my mind was the words of oft-vilified Catherine MacKinnon: **""When will women be human? When?""**

**""There is a police officer in this station

I turned on my heel, but did nothing. We searched for you, but you were gone. And then I let myself cry. In the middle of the crowded street outside Union Station, I silently felt hot tears run down my cheeks. I only nodded when the police officer said he wished he could find the guy. My mouth pursed in a hard line when he said that you were *""just an idiot""*. That you *""probably just had [your] ego bruised"".*

And in the back of my mind

I still met up with my friend. I still got dinner with her, under whose authority I at times genuinely believed I would die. I have survived so much and you will not break me. You will not rob me of my identity or autonomy. You do not have that power over me.

I am strong, with your drunk, slurred speech, with your dismissive attitude towards my identity as a human being.

Although I was already put off and a bit alarmed by someone honking at me-- generally such behavior is followed by some form of harrassment-- I figure, couldn't hurt to help someone out if I can.

I pointed him in the right direction,' 'not sure where I'm actually staying,' 'my living situation is in flux,' etc.) He gestured to a house up the street (the house at which I'm staying for the next month or so), told me he saw me walk out of there, and asked me if that's the place I'm staying in now. I shrugged uncomfortably and told him no. At this point, he started to idle his car and moved over to the passenger's seat. He started pestering me with increasingly specific questions about where I live and work, telling me that ""he could help me get to work on time if I could help him get off."" I started to seriously panic, huh?"" I replied that I did, and I wrested myself away

I'm really shaken up over this. First of all, even if I didn't have a boyfriend, why would that make this shitlord any more appealing to me? It's not as if I would want to be forced into a stranger's car if I was single! Third, and worst, the power dynamic between the two of us was really scary and intense, since he was in a vehicle-- he could have easily used his body to pull me in, or chase me down, but it made me feel weak and really vulnerable.

This would be a rant but I'm so tired and angry I just want to cry. I didn't experience hardcore racism till I came to the US. And then I discovered that my culture is not respected as a culture. Chinese people aren't real people. They're Communists, or poets, or teachers, or leaders--silly doryfishie, what were you thinking? 
So for five years I've been fighting the system and it feels like I'm fighting everything every minute of my life. I'm fighting for the right to walk alone unharassed. I'm defending my ability to speak English. I had to work twice as hard--at a WORLD RENOWNED UNIVERSITY--to be considered half as good as the white kids. White kids were late to class all the time, how dare you speak to me like a child.  
And then the cultural appropriation--I had LITERALLY never seen this. EVER. It was beyond shocking to me that people were so casually consuming other cultures without care, or slutty Pocahontas? Who used chopsticks to hold up their hair? I saw a girl using chopsticks once stick them both vertically into her rice while she put her hair up--with TWO MORE CHOPSTICKS. I was like...that's like me putting my hair up with a fork. Seriously, you look silly. And placing your chopsticks vertically down into your food is extremely rude and bad luck--it's how Chinese traditionally made offerings to the dead, it looks like incense sticks.  
This would be a longer rant but I'm so tired and so angry and so sad that I just want to cry. It feels like this country hates me some days. And the fact that I chose a black man for my life partner--we are SCREWED. There are people who have physically threatened us for walking on the street together, or hop on the Internet and make sure you don't get a Maori tattoo that is sacred to that culture. Or put chopsticks vertically in your food. And please, please don't reduce minority people to the goods of their culture. I am far more than dumplings, chopsticks, qipaos and Communism. I am far more than the outward markings of my culture. Please don't over simplify me and PLEASE don't hypersexualize me and other minority women. There are real problems to it.  (and also please don't demand that I educate you or else your racism is justified. It's not my job to enlighten you.)

I have found: an awesome video of an Asian spoken word artist speaking out against unfair casting practices by La Jolla playhouse; numerous examples of people using racial slurs being called out; examples of minorities being whitewashed in the media; hypocrisy among liberal activists being called out. I get why OP didn't like that blog now. Who likes having examples of their mistakes being shoved in their face? Who among us actually has the guts to confess that they have been doing bigoted/ableist/supremacist (and so on) things?

This year, and my pores are not happy about it and 2) I like spending money on beer more than I like spending it on cosmetics. I thought I'd share my procedure &amp; commentary below, for those here in SRSWomen who are interested. 

1. Gather your supplies. You'll need 1 tbsp of unflavored gelatin (like Knox), 1 spoon, and 1 large blunt instrument of your choice.

 2. Mix the unflavored gelatin and the milk thoroughly together in the bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds

 3. Spread that shit all over your nose, on your lips, or the soft skin right under your eyes. It's gonna smell funky, a bit like burnt marshmallows; just roll with it.

 4. Go do something else for 20-30 minutes. If your roommate/significant other/obnoxious family member sees you &amp; makes any comments about the color and consistency of the substance currently all over your face, as it may disrupt the drying process. 

 5. When you feel the edges of your strip/mask/etc starting to peel away

 6. Cry. 

 7. Keep ripping.

 8. Cry some more.

 9. Did you put any on the soft skin right under your eyes? Cry EXTRA HARD. 

 10. Marvel at all the shit, oh my god it's EVERYWHERE, that will be sticking to the underside of your strip/mask/etc. If you don't see any gunk, look closer; all those tiny things that look like small whitish brown hairs are, in fact, tiny little dirt columns. That used to live on your face. Yup. 

 11. Scrub off all the last little bits you couldn't peel away with a damp washcloth. Marvel at your newly clean

He was a fantastically douche-y hipster guy

Anyway, and S). We were sitting at a table, enjoying our drinks and telling each other what we did over winter break, when Douchenozzle and his sidekicks sat at our table completely uninvited. Immediately I'm like ""Oh god, what now?"". This particular bar is pretty decent, but there are some characters in there, and I've had some weird experiences. But I don't think anything tops this.

As soon as he sat down

My friends and I were completely taken aback. I mean

I told Douchenozzle that, and how would she like if we tried to guess all their penis sizes? At this, Turd #1 sat next to her and tried to put his arm around her. I couldn't believe that. R looked at him like he had about five heads and he sort of backed down. I got the feeling he and Turd #2 weren't entirely comfortable with the situation but were going along with Douchenozzle.

C asked Douchenozzle what exactly made him think that was a good line. He told her it ""wasn't a line"". What the fuck does he mean it's not a line? What

So we told them to leave again, and that he really wanted to guess, and he figured S for a B-cup. I can't believe he had the audacity to say that! Of course we were offended! I mean, we were kind of laughing because he was so pathetic, but we were laughing *at* him, not with him. So we all started yelling at him, and people started standing around and watching, so I sort of pushed him away from me with my foot, but it was kind of expensive

And they LEFT. Not just our table

The first red flag came when I received the textbook. It's clearly self-published, pocketing most of the money from each sale. It's riddled with grammatical and typographic errors, and it's so disorganized and jumbled that reading it gave me a headache.

I could deal with that

Then I started doing the assignments. For this class, then wrote a summary on it. There was no grading scale, just an arbitrary ""I liked it, A/B"" or ""I didn't like it, D/F"". Again, I thought this was a little weird, but I was getting good grades in the first half of the class

Then we start getting into the subject matter for real

* females dress sexually in order to attract males
* misandry is real
* ""[Female students] are so innocent of the politics behind the gender monologue in this country! A very few are canny enough to know that victimhood is a political resource, are adamant that it is too soon for these truths to be revealed.""

(There are more examples that I can post if anyone's interested.)

Combine that with the fact that this guy gave me a C in the class for not toeing his line and eating up his /r/mr bullshit while giving a football player (a star football player at a D-1 institution

I was lucky enough to stand up because I got a call on my cell phone. I turned around. we made eye-contact. He looked furious and slinked away. 

I've learned since then. I've learned that I'm not safe. I've learned that men can do whatever they want because they want to. I've learned I'm not pretty enough

**Him**: Lol wow so many up tight people on here and i was just joking

**Me**: Alrighty then. I guess I get to break out the big guns here. Awesome. :D 

First off, inappropriate message. Color me not surprised. 

You're following a really obvious (and super shitty) pattern. I've dealt with creatures like you for years and years. So your reactions are fully expected. And super boring. Yawn. They literally do nothing but highlight how shitty you are as a person. 

Secondly, it suddenly wouldn't be a joke. It would have ""worked"" and you would be happy that your dick-comment got a positive reaction. Surprise, surprise. You're just annoyed (and hopefully, if you have any shame left, you'll also be embarrassed) that I called you out for being a socially backwards, weird-ass shithead. 

Thirdly, you're attempting to put the blame back on me for my understandable reaction of dislike, as if my reaction is somehow out of place and that I should just accept your commentary on your genitals as an awesome occurrence. As if I should be *happy* that you chose to be a weird-ass fuckhead and tell me things about your genitals I had no interest knowing about. There's a definition for that kind of shitty social behavior: gaslighting. 

It's not weird for a person to be put off by what you said. It does not make me ""up tight""

Hilariously, however, expect to be treated like a human being and not a barely cognizant fuck hole. Which you also would have known that if you read anything on my profile since I state quite clearly that I'm a fucking feminist. You obviously aren't one, but with how you chose to contact me, I could have guessed that immediately. 

So, for the sake of the other women on this site, you should just leave OkCupid entirely. Your presence is most likely not welcome and if we have one less gaslighting shitlord in the world as a whole, that would be great, too. 

In summary: I'm not interested in utterly clueless fuckwads like you.

I had to post this because I saw an anti-false rape accusation poster (written as a snarky parody of an anti-rape poster) on r/mensrights

I was raped about two years ago by my best friend's boyfriend's friend. We were at my bff's bf's house, and he left while I spent the next four hours crying. To add insult to injury, he later accused me of ""leading him on."" Sorry, but my exact words that night were ""NO"" and ""STOP.""

Anyway, ""You just regret doing it. I know how girls are."" Even though he was an abusive lowlife, it still hurt. And my best friend said things like, ""Well I'm sure he didn't mean to."" A few months later, when I broke down crying about it, she admitted that she hadn't really believed me. Because of these kinds of reactions, I didn't tell anyone else. I felt like nobody would believe me.

I know that false rape accusations may happen on rare occasion. I had a friend who was falsely accused of rape when he was caught in his girlfriend's house late at night

A little background. My ex and I married right out of college. It was sort of what I thought you were supposed to do, and I put off law school to support him. The work became too much for him (when his natural intelligence wasn’t enough to let him sail through), and he dropped out. We moved so I could go to law school, and he never got a job to support me. He chose instead to smoke pot he’d bought using my loan money, while letting the apartment fall into disrepair. So I started working to support us while I went through school. At the same time, he started lashing out at me. He felt I was making him look bad by taking so much onto myself. He fell into a kind of funk (though not what I would call close to depression). 

Then… he raped me. He will never admit that was what happened. But I had gotten into the habit of hiding my emotions, I just gave in. This one time, I didn’t. He asked and asked, and I kept saying no. And at some point I went quiet. I didn’t want to keep saying no, since it felt mean at this point. But I still didn’t want to. So I froze. And he did it anyway, as though I’d said yes. I cried silently while he did it, but I was face down and assumed he hadn’t seen. I just wanted him to be happy. I assumed it was a misunderstanding.

A month later, my emotional support, my verbal support, and he even had unwilling access to my body. What else could he POSSIBLY bleed out of me? I demanded a separation on the spot.

Over the course of the separation/divorce process, but I was always a terrible liar. He knew something was up), distancing myself from him. He knew it. So when he penetrated me, and he knew I was upset, and I didn’t say anything, he got angry. The anger caused him to choose to lash out and play chicken with me. How long could he keep going before I said something? And if I didn’t say something, then he was justified in doing it

When he told me, for the first time: **rape.** As soon as I said the word, he flipped out. He had what I can only call a psychotic break. He collapsed on the floor, rolled around, cried and screamed. He demanded to know why I would torture him like this. Why I would hurt him by saying that. At the end of it, *I* was comforting *him*. My rapist. 

Things degenerated from there. As unbelievable as it may sound, he never recovered. When we talked about it, he was in denial. If ever I brought it up, he dismissed what I felt. Told me I was being overly sensitive and unreasonable (while at the same time saying I was being an emotionless robot for refusing to talk to him). I was grasping at straws for reasons to break up. He told all of our friends what he had done (in his own, non-predatory words), spreading my humiliation. My being used as little more than an ATM with a vagina. A sex doll. A mutual friend supported his view, because she had been violently and repeatedly raped by her father as a child. Of COURSE she wouldn’t see what had happened with me as rape. It wasn’t even in the same ballpark. And I was incensed on her behalf. He used her horrific abuse to justify his own manipulation and abuse of me. 

I cut him off. I filed for divorce, had some fun silly experiences, and then started dating my boyfriend, and he is amazing. He respects me like my husband never did. I love him, he loves me, and he does those little things that people do when they genuinely care. He brings me flowers when he senses I’m stressed or blue, or just because. If he’s at the store and sees that they have my favorite wine, he’ll pick it up for me without a second thought. He took me out to dinner last night just because he realized he hadn’t done so for about a month (which I hadn’t even noticed). For the first time in my life

Then two days ago my ex emailed me. He is literally DYING inside (his words, and he lost his apartment. His lack of adulthood is my fault. I went through a year of couple’s therapy with him, but evidently that was not enough. 

In a few minutes, stifling her sobs because she knows they will upset him. Keeping quiet when she is upset because he said she was crazy when she expressed her feelings. The girl who, in the shower after, treated bleeding wounds on her lips and vagina while suppressing sobs in order to spare his feelings. That same girl who kept quiet because whenever she said anything, he would throw a tantrum and make it all about him. I was back to being that girl who has a panic attack anytime a man touched her.  I went from badass ball-busting SRSter right back to the insecure, man-pleasing shell of a human that he tried to turn me into permanently. 

That night, scheming to use my vagina for his own needs without regards to how I felt.  I went numb. I started to go to my happy place (corgis and kittens, mostly).

Luckily it took VERY little for him to realize something was wrong. A single unenthusiastic expression. One head-turn away from the customary evening greeting kiss. He’s a good person. As soon as he caught wind, at least). Immediately things went from sexual to intimate and comforting. He was physically affectionate without pressure. Just comfort. He made dinner, snuggled me, placed my kitten on my other side, put a glass of my favorite wine in my hand, and put on my favorite show. He never pushed to know what was happening, he was content to just wait. It was an eye-opener. 

You see, he put it aside. Some small part of me had been thinking I was a bad wife. That I owed my ex some explanation, some compassion. That I was the villain, and I was hurting him by not giving him what he wanted. But my new boyfriend showed me, without even meaning to, that a good partner doesn’t make you feel that way. That a relationship is about compromise, not about giving and giving until you have nothing left to give. You’re with someone because you love them and want them to be happy, and the man I am head over heels for. For what my boyfriend has shown me. For what I learned from my ex

So why am I posting this? Mostly I just wanted to get this out to people who might understand. My boyfriend tries, and also an effort to reach out. If anyone reading this finds themself in a similar situation, I hope you will know you are not alone (being with a man who is “emotionally unstable” and uses his weakness to make you look overly harsh when you come down on him). You may not be in as outwardly a dire a situation as others, but you deserve respect like anyone else, and there is support out there for you. There is always a way out, and things can get better. Life can go on. If you need someone to talk to, please do not hesitate to contact me or a counselor

I joined /r/short because I'm a short person myself. A short woman. I was interested in seeing funny stories from fellow short people

I also figured there'd be some good discussions about heightism

Instead, short-women-have-it-so-much-better, ""women won't date me!1"" crying. The few times I've tried to jump in with my perspective on heightism, I get told I can't possibly understand because I'm a woman. Basically, because I get hit on, heightism in my professional, academic

This morning

Maybe I am being too sensitive but I want to throw my fucking laptop out the fucking window. 

If a woman admits anywhere on Reddit that when she wakes up in the morning she doesn't look like Zooey fucking Deschanel and she's considering having some cosmetic surgery done, and any other number of slurs and put downs. Hell, without any prompting, our bodies as woman are subjected to and inundated with blatant judgment and condemnation. Your boobs are too big; they aren't big enough. Your thighs are too large; Not large enough. Your tummy's too toned, it looks like a man's; It's not toned enough, you're fat! Your feet are too large, your arms aren't thin enough, your butt is too flat

I get that I'm overreacting and being hypocritical, reddit would figuratively tie her to a stake and start a fire. Fuck everything about that. I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed and this thread in particular really made me feel pissy about the gender inequality on this website and in the wider world. I know I should be happy and supportive for someone doing what they want to their body to feel better about it. It just bothers me that women are demonized for it and men are praised for it, that when women do it ""for men"" they're demonized doubly hard (and when they say it isn't for men, they're called liars and ignored)... but when a man does it ""for women"", women are still demonized as the bad guys who pushed him to such extremes, meanwhile men are never held as culpable for the effect they collectively and socially have on women and their body image.

Despite this, every time I go downstairs people are demanding that I come be social with them, which I really don't want to do. I understand their thinking and guess I appreciate the thought, but I am the type of girl who appreciates being alone. So I go downstairs to cook some dinner, I'm heating up some pasta sauce at the stove, and I'm fucking hungry

I turn around I he's smirking at me, and start crying a little bit because I feel awful about wasting food my mother bought for me. Now instead of having sympathy for something HE caused, or, fuck I dunno, actually helping, he just says ""don't forget the bit that fell on the floor, clumsy girl!"". I do what he says, then continue cooking with the small amount of pasta sauce I have left.

He then starts telling me that I had no reason to be so nervous. He says ""After all

I'm feeling nervous that I'm alone with him, and that he was only trying to get me to 'loosen up'.

As if to rub in how 'okay' it is for him to touch me, he leaves, and I finish cooking, and I can hear him and the other housemates laughing about that lonely girl in room 3 who just needs to open up. I head upstairs, feeling like crap, and I also find that my sauce was burnt while talking to him, so after eating it in my room I start to feel sick.

So now I'm not only fucking pissed off that he was grabbing me, I'm going to be forcibly outed to my whole school, and likely be the target of a shitload of transphobia again. And he would think it is completely okay to grab at me in this manner, because he isn't 'into' us women.

The fact that this is supposed to go un called out is the reason why women do not report rape or sexual abuse. Because it's not a REAL crime, it's a joke. It's the reason why it's not taken seriously. WE, as people in society, have the power to say ""NO, that is not funny. That is disgusting. What is wrong with you?"" But no. People who call themselves feminists fucking DECRY those complaints, and back the oppressor. It's about power. He has the power to make a ""free speech"" or ""comedy"" appeal, that's fucked up. Maybe there are bigger implications then just one jackass doing a comedy bit here. We should look into this"". ONE OF THESE IS CONSISTENTLY CHAMPIONED. GUESS WHICH IT IS. The more these jokes fly around
I would say that it is a MORE important issue then equal pay. You just think equal pay is more important because it's something that can be litigated and measured easily with laws. I would rather have rape and the degredation of womens' bodies be the forefront of the feminist effort over fucking equal pay any day. Oh

&gt;There is a huge difference between saying ""we should JAIL tosh for what he says"" and bringing valid criticisms to the table about what he says. You are part of the oppressive system which promotes sexual violence when you say ""oh

&gt;And whats going to happen now is you're going to get all mansplainy


One of his friends went and liked all of my posts on the thread. No response yet. And frankly, it's just an emotional vomit upon his timeline. But I've done little else today besides feel bad, smoke cigarettes and have really upsetting phone conversations. So this is sort of like putting a paper on the fridge. My A for effort. 

EDIT: I was right. Some of the greatest and most egregious mansplaining possible. He even mansplained about mansplaining! It's so meta. 

Him:
&gt;You want to ignore inconvenient facts because they undermine your broader goal. Your refusal to consider the individual fact pattern

Me:
&gt;what facts? Not that I actually give a fuck

Him:
&gt; Furthermore, is sexist on its face. It reveals a demon that the next wave must confront - the idea that any one sex or gender or orientation OWNS feminism. 

Second

&gt;‎""mansplaining"" is a horrible, and YOU should be ashamed for it.

Me:
&gt;""mansplaining"" is when a man tries to explain away misogyny to women. It's not sexist to call it out (Link to article ""Look

Him:
&gt;Beating up on the wrong person undermines the cause. We have a limited amount of political capital, someone who actually fucking MATTERS. You use up all your ammunition on Tosh, and you'll have less for Romney. You could have actually ACCoMPlISHED something in dinging the GOP for opposing equal pay, or, ya know, any of the other things that they've done on their ACTUAL war on women's rights that would ACTUALLy effect an election. But no, a comedian said something offensive, greennoodlesoup. 

Me: 
&gt;Did you read the article? and here, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being. An example would be a female rape victim being blamed for her being raped because of how she dressed or acted. In rape culture, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.[23]""

&gt;LOL @ me being ""sexist""

EDIT #2. After leaving the computer to go have a nice dinner at a nice greek restaurant with my nice nonshitlord SO
Him: 
&gt;What you are doing is judging my arguments not by their own merit, youre not calling shit out, youre just being a jerk who can't properly formulate an argument without resorting to ad homonyms.

So I respond: 

Me: 
&gt;**You're right. If you were a woman I would have been much harsher. Lets be clear about this. I judged what you said because it was a horrible, who also calls himself a feminist, took it to another level. You got feminism WRONG. You got gender politics WRONG. Rule #1 in working in advocacy for marginalized people in which you are not a member: Shut your damn mouth and listen. Marginalized people are marginalized enough without the dominant culture (which is varying depending on where you are. I would be the one shutting the fuck right up in a trans space, or even in people of color spaces *because I am mistaken for white most of the time and enjoy white privilege even though I am technically a POC*) coming on in with your intro to feminist studies know-how and tell them how to handle their own oppression. If you don't, when you get shown the door, DO NOT PRESUME to say that you are being oppressed by them, if you do, no oppression is legit unless some asshole at UCLA or Stanford or whereeverthefuck does a study on it. *EYEROLLFOREVER* http://oforganon.tumblr.com/post/11150747104/to-all-those-men-who-dont-think-the-rape-jokes-are-a**

We would have long discussions on our differing body types, the differences in our period schedules, and the fact that we both have a slightly tilted uterus. When she got a prolapsed bladder a few years ago (my brother and I were both pushing 10lbs when we were born), she discussed the frequency and symptoms of it so I would know in the future (the majority of women have no idea what's going on because no one ever talks about it). Before I went to college she suggested I get on birth control and took me to see her OBGYN, explaining exactly what would happen on the drive over. Just last night I walked into her bedroom and announced ""Mom, my vagina's uncomfortably itchy, use that and if it doesn't clear up we'll make an appointment to check if you have BV or anything.""

If you look around Reddit you'll instantly be able to glean one thing from any conversation where a bunch of assholes are dogging on women and minorities and lgbtqia people. That theme is that holding [white] men accountable for anything is bigotry. I put the white in brackets because every other man of every other race can obviously be held accountable. LGBTQIA men/male-identified people are also always held accountable.

But straight white cis-men? Nope. And it's not just something they do and a nice display of comically absurd hubris

Sounds so obvious

[Take the core of this thread for instance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/149er4/rant_why_do_some_men_have_to_whine_so_hard_about/) A lot of straight white dudes have a bad habit of blaming *everybody else* for their problems (while hypocritically claiming that's what everybody but straight white dudes do). They can't get a date because *feeeemalez*

Suddenly

*Most people don't even know that the biggest terrorist threat to the first world right now comes from extreme right wing fringe groups and white supremacists.* Yet who is the fingered pointed at? Whoever they are...they're brown.

Someone got raped? Maybe he just...

A creep? Maybe he just...

""There's more to this story""

""He's just socially awkward""

""Maybe he has a brain tumor or a concussion""

""He can't help his urges to rape children.""

""Maybe he misunderstood the situation""

""Rape hysteria"" (Only because the rock solid rape statistics implicate men as 98% of all rapists


....Let's all keep in mind how a MoC doesn't get any of these kneejerk excuses.

Let's not forget all the white men who have committed crimes only to have suspect sketch artists draw a black man *even if a white man has been plainly described to them.*

First off

Today I woke up to find that a man who sexually harassed me while in a fursuit costume (he made comments like ""I'm gonna lift your skirt and look at your pantsu!"" and grabbed my boob at a photo-op) AND cornered me / hit on me multiple times has found out my furry identity at large (the costume is not of my main furry character). Since I'm not a well-known fursuiter I didn't think it would happen

How should I respond? ""You're a creep"" or a *silent block* or ""don't ever try to lift my skirt again?""

This guy is also a really horrible person, racist, the works. And the worst part is that he's a convention ""frequent flier"" and goes to every single one I attend. 

Uff. I feel in a bad spot and even more sick to my stomach.

EDIT:

I'm writing a letter to con ops of the convention I am going to go to in a few days about the incident. I have seen him there before and I believe he will be there again. 

EDIT 2:

Con ops can't do anything unless something happens at the con. I'll be extra vigilant (sux) especially since it turns out he grabbed a friend's ass. I can't get a restraining order right now. 

EDIT 3:

He will be at the convention. I told him on a website comment page that I did not appreciate his remarks about my skirt and that I would not like to have contact with him. He messaged me saying that I shouldn't call him out in public...I messaged him saying that I do not want any contact with him and that I am keeping records for precedent.

So, but I thought it was just a wacky side effect of my script lapsing and the resulting being off birth control for a while.  Only, it lasted way longer than cramps had any right to.  Finally, two weeks in or so, I went to the doctor.

Turns out, I had spent the week between when the doctor found a mass in my side and when they could finally get me in for an ultrasound (transvaginal; if you've never had one, they're awkward and uncomfortable as hell) convincing myself I was dying of ovarian cancer like my grandmother had.  After I was diagnosed, though, I started hearing stories of acquaintances and family members who had one.  I was astounded that there was this thing that could happen that never, ever got mentioned to me in my life.  And I can't help but feel like that's a little fucked up.

Now, ""Yeah, I have a cyst on my ovary that's giving me a lot of issues,"" but they were grossed out.  So, even though I know it's the last thing I should do, I'm leaving out the word ovary in my conversations about it.  It's just ""a cyst in my lower abdomen.""  And I'm perpetuating our sucky reactions to conditions of the ladybits.

I can't help but feel guilty, maybe I could have caught this before surgery was necessary.  And now I can't talk about it because it's ""icky.""  Is there anything women can do about this?  Am I a terrible person for not standing up?  Proverbially, at least; my ovaries hurt to much to stand.

Then he started harping on some mutual friends of ours who are very popular in our social circle. ""Girls are falling all over themselves to be with them. What makes them so special? I try to be like them and no one even spares me a passing glance.""

Why are THEY so popular? Because they're LEGIT nice guys. Because I can go with them when I'm feeling exposed and vulnerable, easy to talk to, and don't see the women in their life as potential fuck buddies. They see them as FRIENDS. They don't have ""girls falling over themselves to be with them."" They have a tight-knit group of friends that they care for and who care about them.

And he isn't actually like them. Our mutual friends like nerdy things and do martial arts, as near as I can tell. He's still a jack ass on the inside.

My hosting student didn't seem too interested in talking to me or the other (female) pre-frosh, and got her sorority sister to take us out instead (who I will call SS). I recall SS calling up some fraternity guys and I distinctly remember her saying that ""[they were] going to love [her]"" because she had two pre-frosh with her.

She took us to a fraternity. I had been tipsy before but never super drunk. We played beer pong with the frat boys. I kept thinking I should stop but they kept telling me to play again and again and again. I had never been that drunk before. I wanted the college students to think I was cool. So I kept drinking and drinking. I was so drunk that I could barely stand up. I had never been that drunk in my life and I only remember pieces of the night.

SS called me over and said that I was going to go up to FG's room (FG = fraternity guy

I woke up the next morning, all over her neck. She was upset because she didn't know how she was going to hide them from her boyfriend. I had drank so much that I was still drunk when I went to an engineering lecture, and didn't feel comfortable talking to the professor as a result.

I panicked later in the day when I realized I had a huge, on my thigh. I was already freaked out because I didn't remember enough about my hook up with FG to know if we had had unprotected sex. I facebook messaged him asking if we had had sex and also did he know how I got this huge bruise.

He responded that we hadn't had sex

I was so disturbed by this experience that I decided to apply to **** University instead. I didn't think that something like this would happen at **** at the time. I blamed myself the next day for drinking too much and for going up to FG's room. I refused to tell my parents why I changed schools I was applying to and the full story of how I got the bruise. But in my time at **** University (I graduated in May) I learned about rape culture and how the behavior of students on a campus can make rape more acceptable.

I still don't call what happened to me rape, or how drunk FG was when he had an underage girl performing oral sex on him. I do know that dozens of people were present as two high school girls were encouraged to drink more and more and more.

Thanks for reading, that I didn't have to go up to FG's room with him. I wish FG had realized I was too drunk to be able to consent to what happened, and that I remembered the night better to know how I really got that bruise.

Thanks

He let me cook on line without hovering over everything I was doing and criticising the way I hold pans or taking over stuff I was supposed to do.

I'm not really even sure where to start with this

A bit of backstory: my boyfriend is involved with tech theater at our college. He gets paid to do cool carpentry things, though, I decided to search my university's tag on tumblr (I just set up my tumblr last week to keep in touch with some non-facebook friends) and, lo and behold, she had posted something about the play! I clicked on her name, scrolled through some gifs, and then came to a text-post she'd made Saturday night: ""Had a good time tonight. But then he left with his whore. Ugh. Gross.""

I immediately just kind of had this sickening feeling that she was talking about me. And, she definitely was. Apparently since discovering that the guy she likes is in a relationship, she's posted on tumblr at least once a day about what a whore I am, or speculating about what STD's I'm giving him, implying that I'm not good enough for him, etc. Now, all that I might be able to deal with. It's the support she's getting from people who I can only assume are her friends who like these posts and comment in agreement with her. These are people I've never even met! I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

There's just all sorts of stuff that she's written there, there's no way she understands that.' WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN. She talks about how high maintenance I might be, and how she can't wait for the day that he realizes he's so much better than me et fucking cetera.  

It's just like...is this the mystical Nice Girl? The boyf and I were both under the impression that she took the rejection pretty well - she's been friendly to him since. But on her tumblr (which I understand is a personal blog but...still! Anyone can see what she's writing!) it's just so much...hate for me and lamentation about how guys always choose beauty over brain and his girlfriend is a horrid bitch and all that bullshit

Sorry this got really long, and supported and encouraged by other people who don't even know me! I kind of want to call her out on it. Even more, I kind of want to show it to my boyfriend and see if *he* calls her out on it. Because he will. Because I *know* homie don't play that. But is it even worth it? Should I just ignore it? *Can* I just ignore it?

I'm 21 and have been (on and off, considerate and kind toward me and others around him. We have never what you'd call a ""proper"" fight, we usually sit and talk very openly about our feelings.

Until I started getting heavily into feminism and social justice (it's probably only been about 6 months). I've been noticing more and more that he derails or dismisses me every time I bring up a feminist topic. He knows I was raped and that I am so passionate about social justice and feminism and that it basically defines who I am these days

Case in point: He works as a security guard. I get that it is a really masculine, ""Oh he's a good bloke but he tells lots of sexist jokes"". To which I said, ""And you laugh at those?"".

It turned not into a fight but a heated discussion because his line of reasoning was, I can't do anything to change other people"". I was so fed up by that stage and in tears, I said, ""Don't worry about it.""

He says, and I quote that I'm a ""mouse with a trumpet"" implying what I'm saying has no substance. He doesn't want to hear about what I learned in my gender studies subject. He refuses to acknowledge his male privilege because he grew up poor and has had to deal with a lot of shit in his life (which I absolutely don't want to take away from him).

The final straw was today - I sent him an SMS asking if he'd thought any more about the feminist stuff I was talking about the other day (implying the conversation we had about his work). He said

I don't know what to do. I am considering breaking up with him. After all this time together and planning our lives and thinking he was the one good thing the world had offered me after all the shit I have had to endure in my life, but I feel like his attitudes are not something I want in my life...

Edit: He even had an experience on X-Box Live where someone had verbally abused him - and he was really quite hurt and shocked by that. He said, why would someone say such hurtful things?""

Ok

Since then we've been texting occasionally. He acts really familiar and keeps saying that I'm his ""inspiration"" and ""motivation"". He sends me compliments but they don't make me feel good (he kept doing it even after I told him to stop saying those things). The other day he asked for my home address because he thinks my family looks nice in my fb pictures and wants to meet them. And he says he wants me to go with him to his home country to meet his parents because he's told them all about me. He clarified that we could go to his country in 2 years because he thinks we'll be in a relationship by then. Then today I mentioned in passing a guy I used to date and he started questioning me ""who is this guy? Did you love him?"" and that crossed a line. 

I told him flat out

To make things worse, so it took courage to tell him how he was making me feel (it doesn’t help that the last guy I said no to understood it to mean “keep trying” until I physically pushed him off me). He just seems so socially unaware and completely lacks a sense of what’s appropriate when talking to someone.

I'm sure he means well and he wouldn't hurt me


**tl;dr**: Told a guy he was making me uncomfortable

**Edit**: Thank you for all the kind words and support! I messaged him one last time and took him off my friends list. He said that the only reason he was doing that job was to see me (he has 2 jobs) but now he's only sticking with his first job so I won't be seeing him in person again. He said in the future I'd look back and regret rejecting him because he might not be around any more (I think he was trying to imply that he'd be dead??). But he has left me alone since then.

I am not Muslim myself but I do come from a country where a large majority of the population is. So I do feel like yelling at people when Islamophobia is thrown around.

And it honestly fucking hurts when Western feminists do this. People have been talking about the whole Lady Gaga burqa thing and white people are all like ""oh, it was in some sort of carnivale thing). And Femen running around naked in a Muslim neighborhood, possibly to tell women that they shouldn't cover themselves up. I'm probably projecting on that last point, but still.

CAN YOU STOP. JFC.

Again

The Lady Gaga thing was obviously cultural appropriation, I will help them lower their fucking gaze). Obviously, there are women who are forced to do it, but let's just focus on them, rather than the majority of women who choose to wear the hijab or abaya and see it as a form of empowerment. Ugh, this argument reminds me of an article by Uma Narayan that spoke about how Western feminists focused on the practice of sati (where a widow would burn herself up on her husband's funeral pyre) rather than the more prevalent case of child brides in India.

I just can't fucking deal with all this cultural appropriation and xenophobia any more. There is a difference between appreciating a culture or being invited to participate in someone else's culture and cultural appropriation. And in Gaga's case, other religions or society itself). SAWCASMs are the most vocal about this but when I hear Western feminists do this, a group who I thought that I could trust and look up to, it fucking hurts.

I'm not asking for a cookie or anything, people would dismiss me just because I come from a ""third world country"" (ick, hate that phrase). Shit like this makes me real fucking uncomfortable when I'm around Western feminists because I feel like I'm not included in any way.

""The Second Shift"" recounts Arlie Hochschild's studies on how housework and childcare is shared by couples all across America

According to her

**The Problem Is...**

...that for a variety of reasons, family, marriage, and work. There are literally not enough hours in the day to do everything, even though many women sure do try. Hochschild's research found that women work a full extra month compared to men every year, on average, in such homes. Equally important is the leisure gap between men and women: in the hundreds of couples she interviewed she found that most men take time for themselves and their hobbies, as a result, stress, since the entire weight of traditional gender roles allows them to balance work

WHY and HOW this happens within the microcosm of the home is what the book is about. Hochschild analyzes this under the lens of four core concepts - 

**1. Gender Ideology**

Gender ideology is what a person believes about what is ""proper"" for a given gender to do, that women belong at home and with kids, that men are providers);""egalitarian"" (the belief that both men's and women's career ambitions are equally important, and deserve equal support by men sharing in unpaid domestic and childcare work equally); and ""transitional"" (a blend of the above two, typically manifested in women as the desire to have a great career while also being responsible for home and family, and in men as being ""all for"" their wives working, and willing to ""help out"" a little but she remains in charge of home and family).  

Take the example of Nancy and Evan Holt, a man who shares in domestic work and supports her career as a social worker equally to his. Nancy is egalitarian. Evan on the other hand ""thinks it's *fine* for Nancy to have a career, and he can see it's very important to her, but can't understand why *her* choice should change or affect *his* life."" His gender ideology is classic transitional. 

Another example: Frank and Carmen Delacorte, though, is that when it comes to household chores (though not childcare) they are almost egalitarian. Frank, even while maintaining that Carmen does everything, actually pitches in and does *way* more domestic work than Evan Holt. Frank and Carmen are traditional ""on top"" but nearly egalitarian ""on the bottom"". 

It's not at all uncommon for 'top' and 'bottom' gender ideologies of a person to be in direct conflict. For example, revealed that they were in fact traditional when it came right down to it. Many women who *claimed* to be egalitarian often suffered from guilt when they confronted their husbands about not doing enough around the house, and did a lot more around the house just as a gift to their husbands because they somehow didn't feel good about ""making"" him cook and clean, revealing that they were 'transitional' underneath.

What is your gender ideology? What is your partner's?

Yeah, 2X!!! I have noticed over the last year or so that you've become a haven for ""fat=unhealthy"" concern trolls and I'm so fucking over it.

Holy fucking crap, thin-privledged bullshit. I DON'T OWE YOU THINNESS.

For two months my co-organizer and I promoted the trans -inclusiveness of our space.

Last week, from multiple people, that trans could not, would not be added to the banner because:

* it would imply that ""a man in a dress"" was welcome in the space 

* it would imply that trans men were welcome

* the wording and terms of who's welcome to the space are changed almost every year and people are tired of doing so

* the community that had originally created the space years ago didn't want the wording there


The second point is the most frustrating

My co-organizer and I both resigned. We have since exchanged long, they're women aren't they?) to maintain a certain normativity. 

Flying the trans* inclusive kite was great when we were using it to acquire sponsorships and set up fundraisers, on the space itself, suddenly we were going against the whim of the community. It makes me ill to think of it.

Since stepping down my confidence has felt wholly demolished. I have received no small amount of criticism (in the form of passive aggressive facebook statuses and emails telling me that ""if I really cared

I gave the president of the organization my word that I wouldn't plaster this incident all over the interwebz and sour an already flimsy professional relationship

I don't know if I'll ever recover from this and return to organizing within the community again. Unless its to create a more inclusive, I could raise the money to rent out a private, accessible space for such a party/festival. I'm sure, with time and some positive interactions with the community, I could get back on my feet and make it happen. Revenge may not be the most friendly and communal way of resolving differences, but damn it feels good to be a trans* lady (for me, at least) and I'm not going to waste any time in a space where I can't proclaim that and encourage others to do so.

I think for me it was very similar to why many women like to victim blame with regard to clothing choice. I felt as though if I could separate myself from the ""bad"" women

Additionally I think a lot of it was wanting to feel better than other people, on the fact that I am a woman successful in math and science.

I also see that I am certainly not unique for this characteristic - especially now that I'm working and surrounded by women that are vastly more talented and experienced than I am!

I have tried to not start problems despite conversations like this popping up all of the time because I'm stuck in this class for another two months and am supposed to be networking. I had enough today though and snapped. I brought up that it is primarily a social construct that women be empathetic and that we are not hardwired by birth to be that way.

I'm not sure if you know the premise of this new one, egotistical, greedy nightmare (not to mention extreme womanizer, which ends up causing him to get to Oz in the first place when he is chased away by an angry boyfriend of one of the meaningless women he chases), is the hero of the story.  

He gets to Oz and seduces the first woman he sees - the witch of the west (played by Mila Kunis).  She informs him that he is what Oz has been waiting for - he is here to save all of Oz's people from the Wicked Witch.  He makes her fall in love with him, helps her realize this (by lying to her and making her jealous, since that's what we catty women do), thus turning her against him and his quest to be the savior of Oz.  The two of them collaborate to destroy him, while the Good Witch, Glenda (Michelle Williams) depends on him to defeat them and restore Oz to how it was when her father ran the place.  For some reason, she is unable to do this herself despite her magic wand.  I guess without a man Oz is just a shit show?

1374182998.0,1il6fc,Hilarious anti-feminist rants in a survey I ran for a gender studies project last semester,WhoThrewPoo,72,15,12,"Background: I did a project on how technical recruiting for software companies is affected by the fact that most companies are run by a majority men. Short answer: most think that recruiting is biased towards men (women especially think this). I got some really hilarious freeform answers from people who disagreed.

""I wish there were fewer women [at hackathons], but most of the ones I've seen have been open to the public or to any interested students from certain schools. The ones I have seen don't have an application process so there is no gender balancing or anything of that nature. Yet you insist on turning this into a feminist issue. The last response is ""Wish there were fewer women""... seriously? Could you have made it sound more chauvinist and unappealing to survey responders? This survey is feminist propaganda and I'm sick and tired of it. There are plenty of really nice guys in the world, certainly in North America, who treat women nicely the way they deserve, but women who don't treat those men as if they're wife-beating murderous animals frothing at the mouth are few and far between. If you mention in your class that there are still people who wish there are fewer women and therefore America is still sexist, it'll be another victory for feminism and a loss for truth and equality""
-22 y/o male

""...when feminists complain that women need to make on average the same as men, etc., without ever considering the actual level of interest among females as a whole, it really offends me and worries me about the future of this country. It's such an overwhelming majority of women in America who act like this now too. Everything from breast cancer to technology or television to car insurance in today's America is centered around giving women way more than they deserve because there are probably still a lot of women out there who just don't care enough to earn what they want themselves. I understand that history may have put women down, but almost nobody does today. It just takes time for things to smooth out. Women won't be equally represented the day after they gain equality because laws and social attitudes may have changed, but people haven't, and it will take a few generations for women to start achieving the same levels of success as men. I don't see how that's unfair, feminists are only antagonizing men and dragging all the progress of human history back to a standstill just to let some feminists catch up. Please reconsider this class

So I've had my GORGEOUS baby daughter; she's 6 months old now and I'm finishing up my maternity leave soon. I had/caught/came down with post-natal depression when she was about 2 months old. It was SHIT; but thanks to some amazing support and also the fact that I was really, and from there into real life, I got fantastic help and totally recovered within a few months. There isn't a day that goes by now that I don't feel grateful for being able to be happy and anxiety-free. 

I'm still really active in pro-choice campaigning. I'm in Ireland where things couldn't be shitter for pregnant women. Since the horrific death of Savita Halappanavar here in November of last year

Anyway what I'm really back here is to say that back when I first came to Reddit, I was a TOTAL shithead. Like, TOTAL. I was the definition of a special snowflake. I'd been a feminist from when I was very young; but a combination of a super shitty first boyfriend and an inability to properly analyse the control patriarchy and capitalism had on my self-expression and self-image turned me into a total spanner. 

Finding SRS and all the amazing people that make up this incredible place helped me to find myself again. SRS turned me into an outspoken and vocal feminist, what made me the loud, proud and aggressively targeted abortion rights activist in an Ireland which prizes not speaking up and CERTAINLY not speaking up about your illegal abortion that's potentially punishable by life in prison, least of all while you're heavily pregnant with another wanted pregnancy, or more recently while a new mother to a baby daughter.


Anyway. Thanks

A little more than a month ago I went out with a man I'd been talking to online for about a month or so. He seemed a bit pushy, to which I laughed and said ""What? No. I barely know you"").

Long story short he didn't call for 3 weeks, but my best friend who I am madly in love with did ask to come over and stuff happened but I figured ""Fuck it, dude never called me back, and I like this guy way better"".

Next thing I know my ex from one year ago is calling me asking why this dude I went out with once is sending him messages on Facebook asking how he knows me, asking if I want him to tell my ex he fucked me the first time we met in person, saying I'm ""surprisingly pretty tight for such a fucking whore"" and comments about my body.

I told him I knew what he was doing, even if I don't realize it. I blocked the account they were being sent from, but I'm a bit worried this guy is a loony toon and will try to harass me in some sort of other way. :/

[A brief overview of the affect of environment on the brain

And then for some non-wiki articles:

**Regarding environmental expectations

[Empirical evidence that teacher expectations influence actual student outcomes (people tend to meet the expectations)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1001620): teachers were told that some group of children was intellectually gifted relative to the others. In fact the children were chosen randomly. At the end of the experiment the students teachers expected to be intellectually gifted actually scored higher on IQ tests than should have been expected and than the other randomly selected group. This was especially true in the first and second grades

[Evidence of stereotype threat affecting women's math performance](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/fr/GDP1/papers/spencer99.pdf): ""Characterizing the test as insensitive to gender differences was enough to totally eliminate women’s underperformance in this experiment. Yet when the same test was characterized as sensitive to gender differences

[More on stereotype threat](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/10/1/80): ""We found that Asian-American women performed better on a mathematics test when their ethnic identity was activated, and not the identity per se, that influenced performance.""

[Evidence that women aren't unique in being able to be affected by stereotype threat](http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Math/When%20White%20Men%20Can%E2%80%99t%20Do%20Math, higher achieving women will be more affected by stereotype threat than low achieving women [if you don't like that extrapolation there is also empirical evidence that this holds true specifically for women as well] -- which of course means that the women most qualified for fields like computer science and engineering will be the most likely to underperform relative to ability due to stereotype threat).

[Evidence that experimenter expectation affects scientific reporting of behavior](http://cranepsych.edublogs.org/files/2009/06/Dull_rats_bright_rats.pdf) (and so should skew to favor men where experimenters expect men are more gifted, engineering, etc): students were told that they had either been given rats bred for intelligence or rats that were dull. In fact, all rats were randomly assigned. Those believed to be bred for intelligence were reported to have more correct responses in maze experiments.

**Regarding evidence for discrimination in hiring and measures of competence:**

[Yale demonstrates that professors of chemistry, and also offered her a smaller starting salary and less career mentoring. Although the differences in ratings may be perceived as modest, the effect sizes were all moderate to large (d = 0.60–0.75). Thus, the current results suggest that subtle gender bias is important to address because it could translate into large real-world disadvantages in the judgment and treatment of female science students (39). Moreover, our mediation findings shed light on the processes responsible for this bias, suggesting that the female student was less likely to be hired than the male student because she was perceived as less competent.""

[Yale demonstrates that gender discrimination in hiring exists but that discriminatory hiring decisions are explained away with other criteria](http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/Uhlmann%20and%20Cohen%202005.pdf). More specifically, popular with other officers, but poorly educated. By contrast, the educated applicant was well schooled, media savvy, and family oriented, but lacked street experience and was less popular with the other officers. The undergraduate participants judged the job applicant on various streetwise and education criteria, media-savvy family man when these were qualities Michael possessed, participants may have ‘felt that they had chosen the right man for the job

[More evidence of discriminatory hiring practices](http://advance.cornell.edu/documents/ImpactofGender.pdf): Again a summary from elsewhere, apart from the name. Yet strangely, the male Dr. Miller was perceived (by both male and female reviewers) to have better research, teaching and service experience than the luckless female Dr. Miller. Overall, about three-quarters of the psychologists thought that Dr. Brian was hireable, while only just under half had the same confidence in Dr. Karen. The same researchers also sent out applications for the position of tenured professor, again identical but for the male and female name at the top. This time, regardless of sex. However

**And just because I like this study...**

[Evidence that gender differences in empathetic accuracy can be explained by differences in motivation](http://pages.uoregon.edu/hodgeslab/files/Download/Klein%20Hodges_2001.pdf): ""Two studies of college students investigated the conditions under which women perform better than men on an empathic accuracy task (inferring the thoughts and feelings of a target person). The first study demonstrated that women’s advantage held only when women were given a task assessing their feelings of sympathy toward the target prior to performing the empathic accuracy task. The second study demonstrated that payments in exchange for accuracy improved the performance of both men and women and wiped out any difference between men’s and women’s performances. Together

I really need help with this because I'm starting to feel like the only way I can live is hiding in the basement and never talking to anyone again. :(

So, and I love table top RPGS and video games. I also have the misfortune to be the only woman in most of these activities.

This is extra unfortunate because it's not uncommon for me to run into shitlords in real life. The overt shitlord to not shitlord ratio is about 1:10

An example is back when I was in college, but I'd get comments from some dudes about how these guys were only wanting to be my friend to ""get in my pants."" Other times, I'd hear people claim one of the other women in the class got a bad grade because ""she's a girl."" (I was fortunate to always be near the top of the class, but comments like this still impacted me because I knew everyone was judging me based on my sex first.)

A moment that particularly stands out in my memory is one time when we were all sitting in class and the professor announced that there was a local conference for women in computing going on in a couple of weeks; everyone was invited to go. Champion Shitlord of the class vocally announces after this, but I regret everyday not yelling at him in the middle of class. (I was the only woman in this class and I kept quiet.)

Transitioning more to my hobbies, I'm one of the few women and there are always sexists somewhere. 

I remember one game that I went to during one of these events. The DM was a man and he gave out bonus points anytime anyone made a joke about ""boobies."" This was awful because I was the only woman in the group, ""I fight in this bikini and sleep with the innkeeper"") I normally always try to play a male character to avoid any of these guys being lewd towards me/the character I'm playing as. 

This doesn't happen every time, when it does happen, it gets harder and harder to deal with.

Furthermore, but it's all I can focus on. I feel like I can't leave my own home and engage in my hobbies and profession without swimming against the current of sexism.

I've kept quiet through all of these experiences and I'm considering calling people out on it next time I see it

He recently told a number of his students during class time that white men have the hardest time finding employment today.  As an illustrative example during an unrelated discussion he said one of his female students would not be able to kill a tiger alone, he asked students to decide by show of hand if they would rather be a boy or a girl.  When everyone looked disgusted and shocked and said it was irrelevant and inappropriate he said he'd rather be a boy.  Countless other things in addition to stroking girls' hair and giving back massages without asking.

When students tell him what he says was sexist he insists that *they* are the sexist one because *their* mind immediately went there.  Then he says he has 3 sisters so he can't be sexist.  Then he dismisses anything anyone says and shifts the conversation elsewhere.

I want to rip this dude to shreds.  I've increasingly become more disgusted by him over the years and now that I'm graduating I want to publicly humiliate him in front of his students.

So my question (for those who want to get right down to it) is.. 

How do you date men when you KNOW that a huge chunk of them are shitlords? 

Here's the long story if you want to read it: 

Over the past few years I've had 2 horrible relationships, and a night where he coerced me into sex and it was basically rape but I don't like to call it ""rape"" because when you say that word people flip out. The others involving being called fat, and unattractive for my weight. 

My current ""relationship"" (the 3rd one) is also not going well. I say ""relationship"" because its barely a relationship. We're just roommates who never have sex despite my desire to. We both work, laundry, etc) with no help from him. We also never go anywhere, or do anything together because he doesn't want to. I'm always putting the effort into everything, its always on my shoulders. Just like it has been in the other relationships.. I'm always the one doing MORE, a lot more. Whenever I try to talk about things and discuss my feelings it never goes anywhere, and things never get fixed. Anyway, and I don't have much family or friends that I can count on. 

A very old friend, and he's a good person. He told me a few months ago he wants to get back together, and I told him we'd have to think about it, and that I'm still working through my current relationship and I don't know. 

But then he slowly started subtly pressuring me. He sent me an email with a bunch of almost-naked pictures of himself. I told him to chill out, just talking like we normally do.

I don't appreciate what he's doing to me. How can he think its ok after the bad relationships I've been in? How can he think its ok while I'm still in a relationship? After all the dumb decisions I've made to date assholes because apparently I can't pick the ""good ones""? 

After all I've experienced with bad relationships, it happens to me and almost all other women. It started to affect my life and everything I did and saw and said. I felt enlightened but at the same time I constantly feel outrageous anger at the world because of all the horrible shit women have to deal with. 

I think.. I think I hate men SRSWomen. 

I can't trust them anymore, and I'm still unsure about it. I do get annoyed when I see sexism towards men, and all the stupid stereotypes aimed at men. But its not nearly as powerful.

When I'm walking around, but I can't. On my real account, I subscribed to TwoX, and then I found this place and I like it more because things feel more ""real"" here. I can really discuss how I HATE what happens to women without guys coming into threads and getting massively upvoted. This subreddit is a true women's opinion. 

My two closest friends are bi, I like cock, yes I want to fuck/get fucked by men. Hell, I even identify as a ""submissive"" so I want a guy who can get kinky with me. 

I just don't know how I can ever date a guy again without ruining it by assuming the worst. How can I develop trust? Whenever I think I don't see any red flags

I know I'm making a big generalization about men, fat, ol' me finding them are quite low. Yes, I have self-esteem and self-worth issues, and dating has made them worse instead of better. When I read things, or hear things, or see things from people everywhere that are sexist

How can I be heterosexual

Is it just about finding someone that I like for who they are, it's with sexist men. But I think that most men are internally sexist and they're unaware of it.

I know it's really messed up and that by hating men I'm doing what men do to me. I'm being sexist. Sometimes I wish I hadn't realized sexism towards women

Sorry this has become so long. I love this subreddit

**TL;DR: I basically hate men.. how can I continue dating and having sex with them when I don't trust them and make too many generalizations about them? How can I stop focusing on gender and sexism so much? How can I not let it affect my dating/sex life for the future?**",,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zw0n9/i_think_i_have_a_problem_with_men/

I made a throwaway for this because my brothers know my other account

I have no idea what to do with my life and how to cope.

The context of my life:

I have been brought up in a very oppressive religious culture

The amount of abuse I got for being with someone outside of this little cultural bubble is something that I could never have imagined. I've heard about 50 different versions of ""you have to convert him or dump him"" from *every single person who has found out I have a boyfriend.* They probe and they guilt trip and say awful things and gaslight me. Surprise surprise

I also have a shitty relationship with my mother. To put it short (it would take many effort posts to explain why she is inherently a terrible human being

I've realised how sexist and harmful my culture is, coddled into not even beginning to know how to become independent because I've been brought up to be a housewife - passed on from my family into the possession of whichever man can take my shit. The only two outcomes of me doing the things that would make me happy (remaining with my boyfriend and distancing myself from the religion) would be my family forcing me to continue church attendance and keeping me under constant surveillance and questioning, or ostracizing me from them and my friends. I don't know what I could possibly do in that situation.

Furthermore, which I could never do. It seems like my only option is to live a lie and hate myself for the rest of my life, or hurt literally everybody I know. There is also no way I'll ever be able to stay with my boyfriend in the long run, because I know he doesn't want to convert, and I don't *want* him to convert.

I'm not sure if I've said anything apart from rambling. There's so much I need to get off my chest. I feel terribly depressed and have zero self-esteem due to living with my mother over the summer (feeling depressed is selfish and depression don't real according to her, he'd hate the church and never join, and I guess in the back of my head I almost want him to join to make life easy, but I'm also screaming for him not to on the inside.

So basically

Also, I still wont be free to not go anymore, because, and this sounds weird, my parents have connections all over the country and they'd know within two weeks if I wasn't going.

I am so sorry for the ramble. If you have any questions I'll answer

**EDIT:** I told my boyfriend everything. He's being incredibly supportive and it's lifted a huge weight off my chest.

Thank you so much for your support. Long live the Fempire!

**EDIT 2:** Thank you again. You've really been able to help me clear my head and I feel better and determined.

But I want you to know. I want this to be raw and I want you to feel less alone. I want that so bad. So

After I graduated from college with a degree in history I landed a lovely little

After months of soul crushing searching and rejection I landed a job as a CSR at a local startup company. It didn't thrill me that I wasn't utilizing my degree but I went at with my best face forward determined to make the most of the situation. I worked really hard and proved my dedication and initiative. Within 6 months I was made supervisor. I only had 2 direct reports but that's pretty awesome for 23! Both of them were older than me. One, usually for no reason. I made no big decisions without the approval of my boss (also a man and mostly awesome) but when I presented that to my team he would act like my ideas were clearly inferior to anything he could come up with. When I told some of my guy friends at work (most friends there were guys, there weren't many women) they told me I was just being paranoid and I felt guilty and bad about taking things ""too seriously"".

That is until

Less than a year from my promotion to supervisor I was again promoted to manager of the department.  I was managing a department at the age of 24. Now I had more people, which I did not, I would never reveal any hint of it due to the inappropriateness that would be inherent in that situation. Oh god, I wish I was making this shit up so, so badly. Well, about 3 weeks into my promotion he sent me an email to my personal address. The email basically asked me if I had any feelings for him and it's okay both if I do and I do not. Either way, we'd be cool but he just wanted to know. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I was completely, like assuming he didn't want to know because if I said ""Yes, I do"" he would then be like ""Ok, great, me too!"" rather, he was just genuinely curious for completely innocent reasons. So I IM'd him like ""Hey, sorry, no. Please don't worry. There's no feelings here for you. I'm sorry if at any time I acted in a way that would indicate otherwise but yeah. No need for you to worry!"" I FUCKING ACTED LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT. FUCK. He didn't even respond. He just shut his computer off

Important update, cc's me. It blatantly says that he is feeling extremely unwell and will not be in work tomorrow. Not only that but he had a vacation coming up at the end of the month and he thinks he will get an early start on it so he'll be out for the next two weeks. Um, come again? Then I knew for certain. He was throwing a huge hissy fit. He had developed feelings for me, asked me how I felt, I said no, now he's throwing a huge fit because I don't return those feelings so he's not coming into work for 2 weeks. Again, this guy is married!!! What the fucking fuck. And emailing *my boss* I know he did on purpose specifically to get at me. To try and make me look bad to him.

So

Finally, I didn't want to punish him, I just wanted him long, long gone and far away from me forever. I spent 4 more months in uncomfortable awkwardness having this employee around until there were cutbacks demanded and he went on his way. LinkedIn tells me that he still looks at my profile at least once a month. Can you block people on LinkedIn???!?

I feel like the sentiment is less ""let's bash women who wear sexy costumes"" and more ""let's look at the reason that sexy costumes are THE prevalent type of costume for women on halloween: patriarchal norms of beauty + pleasing the penis"". I am a third wave feminist and I support people's right to wear what ever the hell they please. I also am a VERY strong believer in critically analysing the REASON behind wearing certain things and feeling certain ways about certain types of clothing. For example, OR whether they are aware of the influence of patriarchal norms of beauty and in awareness of/despite these norms they still feel confident in their make-up. 

Similarly

I don't see anything incoherent in being a feminist and wanting to dress sexily. I DO see something incoherent in being a feminist and refusing to or not wanting to analyse why you want to dress sexily. If you are aware of the role that dressing sexily has typically played in the patriarchy (aka pleasing the penis

I hope I'm getting my point across. I don't want to come off as sl*t-shamey - that's TOTALLY not my point - I just want to advocate for awareness of patriarchal norms whilst participating in events/etc that CAN be problematic.

I wanted to see just how the label creep affected the male counterparts to our societies but what I got was comments aimed at the fact women shouldn't be so judgmental towards men. That we have to unlearn the fact that men are capable of raping us and that not all men will. I was appalled. 

Woman from infancy to adulthood are told that men have the power to rape and harm us physically, it just blew me away that their mindset was like that.

I am a woman and I know every single decision I make can potentially hurt those around me. I can make the decision to take advantage of a drunk male friend and molest him. I can get behind the wheel of a car drunk and kill someone but I cannot believe that these men are not willing to sit down and *think* that maybe they could ruin someone's life just because they are bigger and they wanted to get laid. It blew me away. I am still unbelieving about what I read.

For them to tell us it is a stupid lesson that needs to be unlearned. This isn't like peeing sitting down. This is an intense social conditioning woman have had since *birth*. It would be like telling us to stop listening to what our instincts are telling us. It would be like telling us to stop a function of our body. This wasn't taught to us

I don't care that you hate it that you make me uncomfortable when you approach me in a bar. I don't care that you think it makes me an unreasonable bitch because my safety comes before your feelings. I don't care because until you man up and realize that you have the ability to rape someone with what is between your legs, it is part of my psyche.

But the thing that pissed me off the most about that entire conversation was despite them saying 1 in 10 men have raped someone

To start

My issue is more that these are a group of guys that I really like, throw money at them and say awful things. And treat it like it's some sort of rite of passage, to go and objectify women (at a really shady club). That's completely unacceptable to me. I tried explaining this to him, and he's always very open to my thoughts on these things and he seemed to feel bad but I still don't feel ok. I don't know if I feel comfortable hanging out with all of those guys. I know I have my own hang-ups that are probably making this a bigger deal in my head than it should be, but I just feel completely unsettled, my blood pressure is really high right now (my coworkers belittling someone's OCD is not helping). I don't know what to do or how to better vocalize this. 

That was so poorly worded. Ugh.

EDIT: We spoke about this for awhile this afternoon. My issue was not so much with him going (he got dragged along as part of the birthday celebration, wanting to celebrate by going to a strip club that is known to be a bad environment for the people working there, and also for wanting to celebrate by using women as entertainment. He agreed with me and offered to talk to them about it, knowing that I would probably get written off. He reassured me that he felt the same way about the club, didn't like it or want to be there, and can understand, or at least empathize

About a month ago, he was ok, but I wasn't particularly interested. Afterwards I told him I had a great time but I didn't really want to go on another date with him.

About a week after this, said no I wasn't interested again, and left it at that when he didn't respond. A few days later, I got another message asking for another date, this time, I was pissed and just ignored it. Then a week later, guess what another message from Wally asking for a date, I have already said no twice. I not interested now

Nice guy, yes yes that's exactly what every woman wants!

I blocked him, low and behold, NiceGuys^tm descended in a blaze of bitterness and went on and on about how I was such a b[slur] for blowing off that ""guy who obviously had strong feelings for you"" and how I had ""just embarrassed him in front of everyone"". Basically, there was an argument of some kind, though it was mostly just them replying: ""umad"" to most things or coming up with really skewed and terrible logic. Aha, they also decided to insult me and my friends and said: ""no wonder she hasn't got a boyfriend"" ahah. They were torn down and silenced eventually with the help of my online friends... but...

it revealed just how much of a NiceGuy^tm mentality there was with the people from my highschool (now becoming Uni students at the end of Feb). My IRL friends, Wally, no, and for telling these guys that they were sounding like a jerks. Coupled with this, is the fact that none of them accepted my aro/ace side as an acceptable reason for saying no or said I was making it up! Now I'm the dreaded feminazi or better yet, the W[slur] or B[slur] for basically standing up for myself against shitlord NiceGuys^tm among my IRL circle of friends and the people I used to go to school with.

I just feel so frustrated and angry with both myself and them. Frustrated that I had to be so confusing with this whole coming to terms with my sexuality, ""i'm such a nice guy"", ""i deserve a relationship because reasons"" thing is so prevalent among people my age!

About a week after this, and avoid all contact with him after that. He still would try to talk to me and come up to me when he saw me, but I kept it brief. He also IMed me a bunch, but I either ignored him or tried to end the conversation as soon as possible.

Still, I know. I luckily went to college far away so I only saw him if I walked past the store he worked at when I came home to visit, where he would inevitably RUN OUT to come talk to me/try to hug me. He'd send me flirtatious messages, but I would remind him that I was in a relationship and he had better respect that. Still, I was never very firm with him, because he wasn't being threatening, I suppose.

When I was little my Dad and I were two peas in a pod. We did everything together, he introduced me to old records by Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Tom Waits and about a million other artists that I love to this day. He worked 60 hours weeks to keep our family afloat, and allowing my mom to stay home so my sister and I always had a parent here when we got home from school, and I simply can't remember EVER taking a family meal when he didn't thank my mom for cooking for us, and compliment the food. He beat alcoholism and heroin addiction so we could really be a family.

Fast forward to the early 00's. Stuffing feelings to be our rock caught up with him, and he is not missed.) I took some time off school to come home and care for him, which was very hard at 19. He never really recovered from that. He got a head-shrinker that just loaded him up on meds, and allowed him to continue to stuff his issues, and allowed him to think that it was ok to deal with your feelings with drugs, because they were drugs from a doctor. Our relationship got complicated.

He would talk and talk, and never ask me how I was doing. If I got a word in edgewise, he would just respond in a way that made me feel that he had only been waiting for his turn to talk. He got diagnosed with some serious liver problems, and couldn't work any more, but wouldn't even help my mom with dusting, despite being fully able to go fishing with his friends and go to concerts. He'd tell me how proud he was of me, but it felt hollow, because it seemed like they were all into this *idea* of me that had little to do with the reality

Fast forward to now. A month ago he got diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He's dying. God, really dying as we speak. It almost makes it hard for me to breathe, just thinking about it.

I had since moved from our little farm to a major city, fuck my social circle, fuck my busy and engaging urban life. I'm on FMLA, and I've been here, helping my mom care for him, listening to him, talking to him, reading him the stories he read me when I was little, that I'm going placing in) to make sure that I'm by his side, I WILL make sure that he goes to his grave KNOWING that his family and friends adore him

And all the resentment that I carried round for the past ten years? Fucking GONE. Gone, like I was pint-size smart-ass with the blonde flat-top and stick-on tattoos all over again. He busted ass for us, and did the best that he could. So what if in the end he fell back on drugs; it never made him love me any less. I'm just trying not to beat myself up too badly for resenting him. I didn't want to let him be human, I guess.

So, and I hope it's later for all over you, you will be staring into the reality that you'll never hear those lame-ass stories again, and it will crush you.

I've been depressed. School tends to get me like this; I didn't want to go to college in the first place but was kind of forced into it by family. I love learning, and setup of colleges just sort of bums me out, just like it did in high school. I've been here for five and a half years now trying to get my degree, and every single semester the same thing happens. A little less than halfway through, I start spiraling down into a pit of self-hatred, and then I skip a class or two, then I feel guilty, it's not like I even did anything besides lay around eating nutella toast and feeling useless and drinking tea snuggled in a blanket for no reason

[breath]

SO.

I noticed it happening too late last semester. I did fail a class. I started this semester with the goal that I would do better

I was doing so, missed some assignments, got the guilt feeling again... and then, when I went to the school's RN one day for a sinus infection, said, ""Hey, can I get an appointment for counseling with [counselor I've had in the past]?"" Not even thinking about it. Was just there, and did it. No hassle, but in the moment

And so I had a couple sessions. And duh, fixed, or anything. But this morning I woke up late, saw that I only had one pair of pants not in the wash, and realized they weren't appropriate for the weather (they're super cute slashed-up criss-crossy jeans and I love them, but it's COLD) so I threw on some sparkly gold-and-black tights on under them. Then I realized, that's pretty fucking cute. So why not go the whole mile? I grabbed a plain purple scoop-neck and put a cute black button-up on over it, and my purple faux-wool faux-peacoat, *depressed*, and took one look at my ridiculously sparkly tights

Not great

And that's a lot more than I've been able to say for weeks now.

So, and if you can't be anything else, just be... okay.

*bonus:* I didn't even deal with any shitlords today. I must have looked too intimidatingly awesome.

*edit*: do any of you know of a brand that makes cute, but rolling tights' waistbands down always seems to be a recipe for disaster (descending crotch syndrome, anyone?)

Then this:

I had told her one night that occasionally i enjoy being submissive during sex, she was ignoring me all night, so we had a fight and i somehow made it back to Brooklyn by myself in the middle of the night on the subway. 

I then woke up that night to her entire hand in my vagina. I didn't know how to react at first, and because it hurt so much. She kept pushing me down and ended up fisting me. My vagina was bleeding and i was crying, she just told me to shut up, and that i liked it, i'd brought it on myself because i had told her i liked to have sex like that. 

She continued to take that approach and i eventually convinced myself that she was right, and i often have great resentment toward women who treat rape as a male thing.

A few years ago, and he had a lot of interests that I sort of struggled with, one of which was transvestitism.  I decided to be game and give them a shot, so he put on my make-up and lingerie and we tried it.  It did not go well.  We stopped half way through and had a long talk about it, but it didn't really come up again.  He could tell that I didn't like it and that made him feel terrible.

So a few months ago, sexualities and the importance of being empathetic.  Those couple of years ago... I don't think I was a shitlord ever, but I was very ignorant.  I've always always been supportive of LGBT rights, but my eyes have been opened a lot.  I brought up the transvestitism fetish and told him that I was open to trying it again.  I didn't want him to feel like he couldn't express himself and that I felt differently about it now.  That might have been a little premature.  

He ended up opening up to me about how it wasn't just a fetish; that he's felt bi-gendered since he went through puberty.  I understood from a few years ago that he dressed in his mothers clothes sometimes, because he loves his penis etc., and he wouldn't find a joy or completion in taking hormones and having an operation the way that a lot of trans people do, because he doesn't identify in the same way.  He's done a lot of research and I think he understands himself as trans, but he has a hard time finding exactly where in that spectrum he fits, which I think is causing him more anxiety.  He has continuously told me that he would find a therapist to talk to, but as is his way, when really I probably should be talking to someone about my own issues with it

I'm struggling with it.  On one hand, and I can see it.  He is a brilliant man that constantly self-sabotages himself and hasn't been able to find a career that he enjoys making any kind of money.  He's always lacked motivation to do pretty much anything.  He says this makes him feel more whole, and he thinks that now that he's dealing with it, he can start his life.  I agree with that, and I am extremely happy for him.  In the end, all I want is for him to be a happy person.  His lack of motivation has always been a sore spot in our relationship, as I have already started my career and am definitely the breadwinner.  It's not that I want him to make more than I do, I just want a partner.  One that doesn't get upset when I ask him to help me clean the house

So on the other hand, sorry if it is problematic... - is just really a turn-off to me.  I don't find it sexually attractive.  It's not good for either of us, because he knows on a level that I feel that way.  I've communicated it the best I can without hurting him, which is hard.  It sucks because he's basically having to compartmentalize it like he was before, where he does it on the day I work and he has off and at night after I go to bed.  When I get home from work on that day and I can see traces of eyeliner, it makes me moody.  I almost don't want to be around him.  I am struggling because I FEEL SO GUILTY FOR FEELING THIS WAY.  I AM BEING A SHITLORD.  It must feel so horrible for him to see me react that way.  I mean, to be perfectly honest I'm okay with it being an abstract thing that I don't really have to see in action.  We can talk about it, but I'd really rather not see him dressed

I'm really really sorry if this is upsetting to any transperson reading.  I know that I am being an asshole and I don't know what to do about it.  I am not transphobic - am I ?!?! :( -  Is it okay for me to not find it attractive in my relationship?  I know this is long so I'll just leave it here and I can clarify anything in the discussion.

please help me ladies. :(  I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub for this

Hard hitting. I've articulated this myself a couple of times

Couple this with the fact that study after study has come out proving that pop culture/Western society trains people almost from birth to see women as objects. That's for everybody

To better capitalize on it, body type, hair length and other aesthetic features.

That's one thing about internet anti-Feminists that cracks me up. The first word out of their mouths in ire is how unsightly we are.

My brother and I are very close. I'm 25 and he's 21. We have really similar personalities and sense of humour, and he's always been fairly receptive, and understanding, but apathetic enough on the whole... he basically agreed with me and my positions, but by all appearances didn't give it much thought, and also didn't really understand why I spend so much of my time talking about it and caring about it, 'working myself up' so to speak, and I knew he understood where I was coming from

Then something wonderful happened.

I was on IM to her, I couldn't resist', and saw that *he* had made a comment on the thread himself (he must have seen it come up on his little side feed thingy). And [this](http://imgur.com/fR8Kn) is what he posted. I read it and literally cried with happiness. I have *never* seen him arguing on the internet before, **ever**. This was totally unprecedented, and not only that, but I had *no* idea that he had given enough thought to the things we talked about to be able to put together a comment like that. I messaged him to thank him and he said he just couldn't resist after seeing those guys talk down to my friend as if *she* was in the wrong when they were clearly complete dopes.

It was so white we called it vanilla valley. There were maybe five black students and a some hispanic students at my high school. I recently move to Washington DC which has a large black population. Now

I went to CVS (drugstore) to buy some makeup this weekend. I noticed that there was a separate section of makeup for black women. It was filled with dark foundations and richly colored eyeshadows and lipsticks. I walked to the checkout and noticed they had a separate section for black hair products and for the first time I was struck by the privilege I have as a white woman. By placing this products in sections separate from the other ones it was implied that black women are ""other"" or a special interest group. Instead of having the foundation go from lightest to darkest on the shelves it went from lightest to the darkest that could still be considered white and the dark ones were in their own section. I honestly don't understand why foundations and eyeshadows that work the best for darker skin pigments need to be segregated from the rest. I use the word segregated on purpose because that is how it felt. There is no reason for the black hair products and dark makeup to be in different aisles from the ""normal hair"" products and the lighter makeup. I feel like doing this just enforces the idea of white=ideal and black=lesser.

So in this class each student had to give a presentation about some aspect of french culture compared and contrasted with that of their home country.

Both of them mentioned a lot of important dates, abortion care, contraceptive care, the right to divorce your husband and also the right to prosecute your husband for rape. The woman giving the presentation on Feminism was Irish, and gave a very impassioned speech about how shocking it is in Ireland that rape within marriage was legal until 1995. Then Shitlord raises his hand. Now, this kid has a history of asking hands-down the dumbest fucking questions in existence, but this one took the cake- he said in broken French something along the lines of ""I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out of that law, isn't a thing.

1.) I think a lot of this is going to be triggery, fat shaming, body shaming, and other assorted fuckeries.**

1 1/2.) Slurs get you benned, I think they're necessary - not because we need to use slurs against chucklefucks when ""chucklefuck"" is a perfectly good non-slur way to go about it, but because many of us will be quoting others when recalling experiences, and the unfortunate reality is that much of the language used against us in these situations is chock full o' the slurs. Avoiding them entirely means you won't be able to tell your story as it happened, but replacing letters with asterisks borks the hell out of the formatting if you need to do more than one, and I think it's important that those of us comfortable doing so display the full impact of just how horrible some of this shit can get.

I decided to start with street harassment because there's been some discussion about it lately &amp; this is one most of us can likely participate in. I'm using ""street harassment"" as a catchall term for the various things strangers say/do to us when we're out in public - slurs screamed out of cars, being propositioned, insulted, spit at, threatened, etc, etc

I am 16, drags me bodily out of the car I am sitting in, making a concerted effort to stuff me into his van. I escape by suddenly dropping my weight, falling on him like the proverbial ton of bricks as he hits the asphalt. Then I scramble up, kick him as hard as I can, and run into the store across the parking lot. I have never moved faster in my life, but all around me, in the parking lot of a store on a busy intersection in a highly urban area

I am in my late teens, I must leave long before the sun rises to walk miles to the main bus station in the dark, because the bus line by my place doesn't start until after my shift starts. One morning, a car rolls up alongside me. A man inside asks if I want a ride. I decline, because yeah right, but he keeps asking. I'm not sure what to do, because the street is deserted like it always is at this time, so I just ignore him and walk faster. Nearly every morning for over a month afterward, but he always seems to find me again after a day or two. Eventually

I know they are not to be trusted, so I'm pretty much screwed here. 

I approach the car and ask if there's a problem. He says no, threatening. It makes me nervous. It pisses me off, too, but I know I can't tell him exactly what I think of him, because that won't end well.

I whirl on him, I am categorically NOT going to get into your fucking rape-mobile, so just leave. Me. The. FUCK. *ALONE*."" He recoils from the window a bit, then calls me a cunt and stops the car. 

The street is so quiet, ""He's gonna get out of the car now. Get ready, here we go, let's fuckin' do this."" I face him full-on, squaring my shoulders, but he just sits there for a moment, doing nothing, that makes me even *more* furious - like, I get three hours of sleep a night (if I'm lucky) because I've got two babies to take care of in addition to working, drag me in there with you? You just fucking TRY it. See what happens. TRY IT."" 

I don't know if he somehow intuited that I was pissed off enough at that point to make him wear his ass for an attractive and fashion-forward hat using naught but my superior bitch fu mind tricks or who knows what, because he noped right on out of there instead. Smart man.

And then I am in my late 20s, ""Lookin' good, bitch."" 

I can't help but picture him inside his house, and I desperately want to turn around and tell him exactly how he can go fuck himself, but I can't. 

I have to ignore him, so I can't risk it. I feel my mouth compressing into a thin line and my eyes narrowing, and I wonder how long it will be before it's my daughter's turn suddenly, *viscerally* understand why.

I have been approached by men who have asked for my phone number, my smile, my body, etc. I have been asked when my birthday is, so that a male customer can return and buy me expensive things from my department. 

I have talked to other female employees at my job about whether this has happened to them, has been told that she has ""beautiful breasts,"" and in another instance, asked to ""spin around so that I can see your ass."" Another female employee has flat out been groped by a male customer.

I shouldn't have to explain the insanity of these stories, we are there to sell things and buy things. That's all. My sexuality and appearance have no bearing.

The issue that I find is that my store's sexual harassment policy is woefully negligent of this reality, and it has been entirely unhelpful. Managers have suggested we wear baggier clothes, that we appreciate the compliments instead of rejecting them, or that we find other ways to avoid further advances without correcting the male customer's behavior. I ultimately feel that if I chose to react to a male customer's advances rather than smile and accept them, I may face some pretty serious consequences or safety risks. 

Edit: I should note too

Now we got this new woman, offered him a job working in the plant with all of us.

 Everyone was okay with this until B tells us something. Her boyfriend has a criminal record, back to it.) So we learn this and all we can think of is, perhaps it is a bad idea to bring this man into a work place full of women.

 We send up one of my coworkers to bring up the issue to C. She told him that we were all concerned about the safety of the workplace if the man was hired. That we would be uncomfortable if he was. (He was going to be hired to work in very close proximity to us.) He asked her why we would be concerned and she asked him if he was aware that B's boyfriend was a convicted rapist.

This us what blows me away. He said he was fully aware and that it was none of our business. He brought her down to the work floor and laid into us about how this was the reason he wasn't going to tell us because we would overreact and get emotional. That we would cause trouble about it and we really needed to grow up and get over ourselves. 

I could not believe it. I still can't believe it. We told him that if he hired the man we would not be comfortable and could very well quit. Well that sent him off on a tangent again and we were forced to listen to this man practically defend this vile human being and slam us because we were worried and concerned about our safety if we were to be forced to work next to a violent rapist.

Its been two days since this incident and C has decided not to hired B's boyfriend because he can't replace us all but he's still pissy and we are all horrified about it. I just can't understand C's reasoning. This man was a violent rapist. He left his victim in a hospital for months and I don't care if he 'did his time'. This is not information you withhold from your work force and this is not an issue in which you defend the man rather than listening to your clearly scared and worried employees. I mean fuck. It wasn't an overreaction on our parts

I was so pissed off I was shaking. I have never encountered this before and I was horrified. Needless to say I will be looking for a new job at the earliest possible moment but all I can think about is that poor woman he did that to and the fact that this monster is now living in my town.

I had an early-pregnancy abortion when I was young and got pregnant while I had an IUD. I was with the guy I am now married to

We've never regretted the choice, if that makes sense.

We're at a place in our lives where we want to have children, but it's an unspoken but relatively hard line rule that the parents and parents to be in those areas experienced a loss that was spontaneous and not an abortion or deliberate medical choice. Going into vent threads or feelings-sharing threads can be land minds of rage towards people who've had abortions. Not really good when you're dealing with peculiar feelings on your own journey from pangs of sadness to pangs of relief to then pangs of guilt about your own past and going from pregnant to not pregnant without birth or a baby to show for it. 

I don't know WHY I didn't expect this to bubble up when I started purposefully trying to become a mother, but it's hard to keep the shield up from how inundated women who get abortions are with the certainty from so many people that what they did was objectively wrong no matter what (and from both sides.. pro-choice people who say ""I could never do that to my baby, myself"" are many times just as psychologically damaging as pro-lifers). These aren't regrets, but more intrusive thoughts that really are things only other people who've chosen to terminate a pregnancy and are now pursuing or are in parenthood will likely understand fully. 

The thing that also sucks is that because of the fact that there's pretty much no dedicated forums for it, especially as it relates to becoming a parent later on down the road. Instead you either get people getting huffy or angry with you, or directing you to religious websites to ""purify"" yourself or tell you to take it up with a therapist, when all you really want is to talk to some other people who can be like ""Oh god yeah, I worried the same stuff, you're not alone!"" and maybe an assurance or two of ""But it all turned out okay for me!"" and maybe a place to commiserate with other people how the anti-abortion propaganda out there has psychologically affected you.

How do I get her to realise the harm she's causing?,UndercoverShitlord,79,33,28,"I posed this question to /r/girlgamers and (su-fucking-prise) half of the comments were men telling me just to deal with the fact gamers are always going to be terrible human beings

I'm part of Reddit's Eve Online spaceship alliance. It's a very large alliance (over 2k people at a guess) and, and super-complicated economy the playerbase is somehow even more dominated by male MMO nerd types than most other MMOs. The playerbase seems to be a bit older because of the complexity of the game scaring away the 14 year olds, this doesn't seem to make it any more mature though.

I know of quite a few other women in the alliance who also keep quiet, plays up to their lewd and suggestive behaviors to the point of fake-orgasming for their entertainment, and even when she isn't being actively hounded by her ""fans"" she seems to go out of her way to sexualize every conversation she's in. Obviously this makes her very popular, which isn't in itself a bad thing, but she also badmouths girl gamers for being oversensitive or not being able to ""take a joke"" when being told to get back into the kitchen for the 10,000th time. From a forum thread:

&gt;As a female

&gt;Feminists always get fucking butthurt that they are treated differently, it's just that feminists always run and make posts about how mean everyone is to them. Whoopie-fucking-do, someone said get back to the kitchen. SO THE FUCK WHAT? If this offends you so much, maybe you should get back to the kitchen because the internet and life in general is not for you.

I've had private discussions with her about this and she believes that by being a loud female voice she makes it easier for other women to join in but doesn't see that portraying herself as a controller licking attention seeker who enjoys misogyny and rape jokes actually reinforces the attitudes in the alliance that keep so many women from participating. I think she's actively hurting the girl gaming ""cause"" but she thinks she's being liberating.

Also, etc). He would make me feel horrid about my body and would always laugh at me and say that I didn't turn him on. Once he had me lay down on my bed (my parents were home and thought we had just gone upstairs to get my iPod) and was about to penetrate me, but I said, ""Is this a good idea....?"" And he stopped. I don't want to go into that, though. That was the scariest time in my life.


Couple weeks ago me and a guy I've had interest in for a long time (That situation is complicated, too. It was all good, all consensual. though I know that the line can be fuzzy when drugs/alcohol are a factor.) and after a while (I was extremely wet, so I know that wasn't the problem) he started to insert, but couldn't even get the head in. I cringed and grabbed at his arm, so he stopped and looked at me incredulously (concerned type of surprised, though, then he couldn't do it. I told him to try with his fingers for a second, when suddenly I felt my pelvic muscles twitch (It was already hurting) and felt this horrible shooting pain and a burning sensation. I audibly cringed and he stopped immediately
So I've been reading around about what could have caused this, no BAWLING. This explains why it took me years after starting to masturbate to be able to insert even one of my skinny fingers (and my fingers are seriously slim) into myself. And why I couldn't even insert the tiniest of tiny tampons for the longest time. And why the jumbo sized ones hurt me so badly.


I feel so alone and scared. I absolutely positively can't tell my mom about this. I don't have any aunts or grandmothers I could talk to. My school counselors/nurses are utter shit. I literally have no one. I don't want to be this way. I want to be able to have sex. What do I do? I feel utterly helpless.. I've looked up some of the exercises for it


Someone please guide me in the right direction :( I hope I'm not overreacting, when I went to the doctor at 13 thinking I had a septated hymen, wondering why the fuck I couldn't get a tampon in, DID NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT VAGINISMUS? Why am I JUST NOW figuring out my body is messed up?! I just want to fix this. I want to be normal.. I feel betrayed and just..so sad.

I get there, when in comes the vet. Grayish guy, mid-50s. Before I get into the conversation I should point out that I'm in my 30s but look like I'm in my early-mid 20s. 

He sees what I'm buying and starts off with:

""If you haven't spayed or neutered your cat, which should tell him several things - I've had this cat for a while, at least long enough to have him neutered, and I probably know what I'm doing as a cat owner since I had it done.  

""What food are you feeding him"" - he continues, I don't specify which type of food.

""You should really give him food for sterilized cats"" - and here I start to get pissed off. I tell him that I do

He continues mansplaining cats to me - ""Do you feed him grass?"" - to which I answer that I do and that I've had cats all my life

The next question totally floors me - ""Are you married?"" - WTH??? Before I get the chance to tell him it's none of his business he starts telling me how I should have the cat checked out for toxoplasmosis

""I meant nothing wrong

Why the hell would he feel that it's OK to talk to me, and my desire, or not to have children? Maybe I don't want to have kids, maybe I can't and that's a painful subject, maybe I'm gay, maybe I'm asexual etc etc. Because I'm perceived as a young woman of course, and that must mean that I don't know anything about anything (cats included) and that I'm planning a family.

[background](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/129u9e/i_know_twox_isnt_for_everyone_but_is_there/) if you don't.

I just... ugh. I wouldn't say that it triggered me

From the time I was 11 or 12, but it was never physical. It started one time when my brother and I were visiting, but my brother and my grandma were outside, so my grandpa and I were alone in the living room, and he turned on a porno. He didn't say anything, or look at me. I was sitting on the couch reading a book, and I just froze. Partly, because then I might have to talk about it, though, and I would avoid using the bathroom at their house so that I wouldn't have to walk through the living room to get to it.

Then there were the phone calls. My family lives in the midwest, they would call to say hi and the phone would get passed around so that each grandkid would get the chance to say hi. Sometimes, he would maneuver it so that my grandma was out of the room when he would get me on the phone, and he would tell me that he'd ""found some videos for us to watch,"" or he would ask whether or not I had a boyfriend yet and try to talk to me about ""taking care"" of a man. This was on Christmas Day, when I was in the middle of the living room surrounded by my family, and I was all of 13 years old. I had to figure out how to let him know that I DID NOT WANT THIS without letting any of my family know about this whole horrible, ""no thank you"" and try to pass the phone off to my brother or my cousin as quickly as possible.

Also, but I (once again) froze, and after a couple minutes he walked away.

And I just... the OP of that thread thinks that I'm just supposed to shrug all this off? That it's no big deal because I was never physically harmed? That I should have calmly told him to stop being an asshole and then extricated myself from the situation? That would have meant explaining everything to my entire family, even just typing it out here is making me slightly sick to my stomach, and I'm doing it on a throwaway. Or she thinks that the fact that this affects me, that it's kind of a Big Thing in my life, rather than just something I can roll my eyes at, is me being whiny and ""acting like a victim""?

And don't get me wrong, that should be every woman's GODDAMN RIGHT. And it was that realization that led me to feminism, that led me to working to dismantle rape culture. The idea that I should just shrug off the harassment that reinforces that rape culture (the same rape culture that enables abusers like mine every day)? Or the idea that I'm at fault for my own abuse because I ""allowed"" it, or that shouting back even always works (it did, eventually, for me, but in many cases it only makes things worse)? It's just absurd and enraging.

When my ex was drunk, and he'd tell me off for being so sensitive when it was just the truth and I must have thought about this before because it's such an obvious flaw.

I think he went over most of my body. My eyes are too small, my breasts too saggy, my hipbones not pointy enough, my butt too small in relation to my huge thighs, my vagina too loose, etcpp4ever.

I broke up with him two years ago and I'm still far from comfortable with myself. But with most of these traits, realise that I'm in fact not some gross monstrosity. I look pretty normal.

But... you can't really do that with a vagina.

Sure, that the guy after him needed several tries to fit in at all with lots of lubrication, that I've just gone through months of training to get my mooncup in and out without feeling too much like I'm gonna tear something, and that it doesn't really matter either way. But it just doesn't change anything.

I haven't had sex without tightening my muscles throughout the act to the point where it's not pleasurable for me since, but this thought ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU'RE MAKING IT EVEN HUGER AND GROSSER"" was prominent the whole time and it's still there every time I use it even though I know it's bullshit.

Last week I got some toys in the hopes that actually doing something with that body part will help me like it more and subdue the huge-and-gross thoughts a little. The first try didn't go very well

1343325330.0,x78eh,Am I overreacting to my boyfriend's treatment of our cats?,honestynet,57,15,72,"I don't know if this is the best place for this post

I'm 28, are not at home. We were curious if we were cut out for being cat owners, as well, so this seemed like a good idea.

Both cats came to us well-socialized, scratching furniture, etc, I took to the internet to find out why they did these things and how to avoid them/minimize the damage.

My boyfriend, but he'll react impulsively when a cat ""acts out"" and put it in its crate rather rashly.

Last night, so I thought it was time to let her go and we'd try again later. Right as I made this decision in my mind, the cat swatted at my face and I took a huge step back. I was fine and I yelled out, but my boyfriend pushed the cat aside and then, even though I told him I was fine, he started yelling at the cat and tossed it across the room.

I had a strong reaction to this and we ended up fighting. I told him that I'd pointed out his poor reaction to the cats in the past,"" and failed to understand when I tried to explain to him that mistreatment of animals is supposed to be a warning sign of abuse and it really made me scared that he would ignore repeat statements by me that I was uncomfortable.

He kept accusing me of being ridiculous or making overblown claims, and ended up in tears. I've been in an abusive relationship before, so maybe I am just being oversensitive? Regardless, the argument hit a lot of triggers and I ended up calling the suicide hotline.

Thankfully, the cats aren't actually hurt, but I was really uncomfortable with the situation and felt I wasn't being heard. I threatened moving out in the heat of the moment, but if I actually do it, I'll probably lose my job and will also no longer have a car (I live in L.A. and that's kinda necessary), in addition to breaking the lease and fucking up my rental history.

The two of us have a couples counseling session this afternoon and I'm afraid of what will happen. Should I stick to my guns on principle

Setup: I work in an educational environment where students come to get aid on coursework from various educators. Educators and students work one on one. I have a newish coworker whose approach and content has raised many alarms


1. He told a student that ""angry feminists"" have made ""she"" the default pronoun in academic writing instead of ""he."" [Which is is just completely false academic advice on top of being totally against our rules towards discussing sexism and politics outsides of assignments explicitly on the topics of sexism and/or politics.]

2. He waxes on and on about how lazy he believes children of immigrants are

3. He ignores students' names on the board while hanging out in the staff office (board is visible from there)

4. He puts his bare feet on the chairs that both educators and students sit on despite the many campus-wide warnings about the dangers of staph. Not rhetoric related

4. He asked for geography lessons on where Bangladesh is in comparison to India from an educator from Bangladesh who was just trying to walk to the staff room

5. He openly expresses contempt for all forms of welfare and dehumanizes those who receive welfare as lazy and/or addicts. On top of these comments just being unneeded

He's relatively new

He doesn't seem 100% malicious, that really makes me wonder if I should speak to the managers. My attendance record at work isn't the squeakiest, so I fear that I would get terminated or laid-off for airing my concerns with this educator's methods.

Back when I was a teenager growing up, but we all got along. 

Anyway, I'm now a huge liberal, live in a really liberal state with really liberal friends and have started dating really liberal guys. And the thing that really bothers me? I can't even say this out loud, because it seriously twists up the britches of almost every liberal guy who thinks he's above this (but I'm in a unique position most people don't ever understand, I think, of having a very varied and broad range of life experience with different politics/dudes) - but I need to get this off my chest.

LIBERAL DUDES ARE SOMETIMES WAY MORE MISOGYNISTIC AND AWFUL THAN CONSERVATIVE DUDES. WTFFFFF??????????

It's like they're more offended when you're hurt by them because ""LOL no way I'm totally the most enlightened guy ever."" and they lack this deeply ingrained chivalry and respect for women that a lot of southern christian boys have- and I know, srswomen, sometimes I actually miss it! Sometimes I actually think the ""always respect a lady, never hit a lady, never pressure a lady for sex, never ask a lady about her sex life, be a gentleman"" stuff is actually, most conservative ladies are ""tough southern belles"" and DO have careers and jobs and are allowed to be sassy and whatever else. The difference? Men find it charming and have a hands off attitude of respect for women.

And liberal dudes often have this brainwashed attitude that sexism against men is a thing or we live in a ""post-everything"" society, most conservative men I've known would seriously LAUGH IN THE FACE of ever claiming that. They wouldn't even dream of it. 

Not to mention, whereas, do I even need to say it? Most more conservative guys wouldn't dare to bring that shit up, or at least would realize that it's not ""lol totally ridiculous for women to ever have reservations about sex and lol we live in a post-slur world lol.""

Why is this so fucked up? Am I alone in this? I will say, but he's a freaking needle in a haystack. If the thought of living with a guy who insists we go to church every Sunday and doesn't believe in taxes and might be a secret racist wasn't so terrible, I think I'd go straight back to the South tomorrow.

* My dad throws everything I say back in my face mocks me when I get upset by flailing his arms in the air and repeating what I say in a childish voice. It's disgusting and insulting
* My dad will try to publicly shame me about my performance at school by telling family member who do nothing but gossip (His defense is that they're family and ""deserve to know"") and tell others how my job is for ""people who drop out of college"" in front of me
* My mom always laughs at me when I'm angry
* My mom told everyone I was ""dieting"" when in reality I was struggling to maintain my weight due to anorexia. This is something I had to work on on my own
* After all this time I still go to therapy in secret
* If my parents ever found out about the above they would label me as a crazy pill-popping zombie
* My parents consider people who take antidepressants as crazy pill-popping zombies
* Telling me that I'm acting like this on purpose and that I should stop hurting them
* My social life is limited. I can't stay out past 10 and I can't drive....parents decided they wanted to teach me themselves and this never happened. My friends have been teaching me when they can.

I told her that was none of her business, she proceeded to take that as a ""yes, I'm a lesbian,"" blocked me from her Facebook (hence my posting this publicly since I can't tell it to her directly), and then proceeded to tell my brother that she thinks I'm a belligerent lesbian. Said gossip then made its way to my mom, subsequently driving a wedge between my family and me based on nothing more than a rumor.

Basically

&gt;I've noticed that a lot of women talk to their boyfriends with total and utter disrespect in public. If a man was talking to his girlfriend in such a manner

AWESOME

&gt;As an example, with her boyfriend, buying some books. She was so mean, condescending, and controlling I was embarrassed for this guy! The conversation went something like this:

[](/goodnews)

&gt;""Hi

&gt;""Yes, she sounded very annoyed and as if she was talking to her 6-year-old son who has issues with listening skills.

&gt;John placed the books on the counter for me to ring through.

&gt;""That will be $23.55"" Me again.

&gt;""John

OH NO WATCH OUT HERE COMES ANOTHER SYLLABLE (literally Hitler)

&gt;John hands me $25. She took the change and put it in her pocket.

&gt;""Put those books in your backpack."" Her again

&gt;He didn't say a word. Not one word. His eyes were downcast. I felt so horrible for him! Now this isn't an isolated case. I hear women talking to their partners like this quite often. They are mostly women in their early 20s. I often think to myself ""if you hate him that much

Note how the above paragraph is all about how horrible early 20's wimminz can be to the poor menz

&gt;So I guess what I'm saying is, and to be honest, no one likes to hear you speak that way to someone else. If he annoys you so badly that you can't control yourself, then maybe it's time to find someone else.

I've been lurking the various SRS subreddits for a week or so now and holy crap

I'm recovering from thirteen or so years of diagnosed social anxiety with a delicious topping of depression icing but I'm still not out of the woods yet. I've only recently been calm (and medicated) enough to leave the house by myself and go places alone. 

I'm a 23 year old woman and holy fuck the amount of misogyny, really. This doesn't bother me however, because I can work on myself and get rid of all my shitty thoughts. Stop using slurs and offensive phrases and better myself.

What's really bothering me is the amount of misogyny I'm coming across and seeing for the first time. It's not only that but I can't tell if I'm just overreacting and becoming too sensitive to anything I might vaguely construe as sexist or if my instincts are right when they scream ""THAT WAS OFFENSIVE!"" at me.

For example today I was out to find some ducting for the extractor fan over the cooker. I want the rigid kind not the accordion-y kind. I tied my dogs up outside the place and went in. After waiting for a little bit the man behind the counter asked me if I needed anything. Now, 'whatchamacallit' etc.

I say I need some of the subduct for the thing over the cooker, (Jif is a brand of cleaning spray in Ireland). I get pissed, make up some excuse and leave. 

Cause the only reason a woman would DARE leave the kitchen is to buy cleaning products, I'd only buy the wrong thing anyway and a man would have to swoop down and fix my silly mistake!

Am I seeing something that isn't there and overreacting to a silly joke a man said in a hardware shop? Or a man claiming women have it 'so easy' while I'm in the pub? What about when I'm also in the pub and a man knows I'm good at computers and technical stuff but insists on relaying what his daughter's boyfriend knows about some problem he's having while asking me my opinions?

It's starting to really depress me if it's only after lurking in SRS for the past week or so that I'm starting to see these things. And if I'm not just overreacting why did I put myself through hell and back in therapy to walk out, GET 2 THRE KITCHIN ND MAEK ME SAMMICH, THE ADULTZ R TALKIN RITE NOW BITCH! LOLOLOL.

You heard it here first:

Fuck Sexy

This Halloween I’m going as a sad zombie clown, but you must! You can’t be serious. Sexy is sex and sex is back in style. The dark days of disease are fading into memories of bad dreams, evaporating like night sweats in the morning light. Repression lost its last stand, the long march of freedom is at back again. Hallelujah the leather-lace BDSM promise land!’

But tell me, guys blessed with smooth skin and lightning fast metabolisms, men who spend half their lives in the gym. Sexy is just barely of age skinny little women bearing curves, women who look nothing like me. Sexy is an exclusive club and chances are you’re not a member, and if you are you won’t be for long.

Sexy has stolen the joy of going out on the town and turned it into a battle of my body and mind and society, sing little sub-cultural songs of inner-beauty and bodies being like flavors, ‘there’s something there for everyone,’ to counter the collective story of never good enough spoken over the endless pulsing beat of inequality, of winners and losers. Which side are you on? I can’t be the only one for whom sexy makes looking in the mirror like staring down the barrel of a gun.

Sexy almost ruined Halloween; turned the one day of freedom to break out of our cells

In SRSHome I made a big long post about how this community helped me with my sexuality issues -- something that had been bugging me for a long time. It was great to realize my pansexuality

Well at the beginning of June, out of the blue, for the very first time ever, I asked myself, ""Am I a woman?""

I stopped in my tracks. Like, dating, sex, etc., and all of the instances where I truly felt secure in my identity as a man. 

I couldn't think of one. That's when I decided that this was a serious thing that should be given a lot of thought. 

So I've been thinking about it a lot. That's good! Ever since I have been, wear clean, ironed clothes every day, match my colors, etc. I used to have crappy self-confidence, but now I am so self-assured that I annoy myself. Seriously! 

I guess it seems silly that I'm improving myself externally as a male when in reality, none of them have had anything but good things to say. The only hurdle I have to overcome now is informing the family. That's going to be hard -- they do not have a history of being accepting. But that'll come later. Other parts of my life are also improving. Even the romantic part of it -- despite letting potential partners know about it! Things are going great.

That's not to say it doesn't get hard sometimes. I still run into many people who don't consider me a woman upon me telling them, then realized it didn't fit, that meant I had to re-imagine *everything*. Partners, parenting, sex, etc. That's **hard**. I'm still re-imagining things every day. That's stressful.

But the fulfillment I've gotten from this journey so far has been worth the stress. I plan to continue it! I don't know if I'm fully ready to identify as a ""woman"" yet. I feel very

I have lived with him all this time but have never gotten to know him. My dad doesn't know 2% of what my mom knows about my life, even though we have lived together since I was born. 


Right now my mom is out of town for 3 days to visit my grandmother. It was 2AM, otherwise people from 2 tables across could literally hear him. So even in his soft voice I could hear him clearly from across the room. He was talking to a woman. Who has a boyfriend. She is a maid, and she borrowed money from my dad. They were whispering sweet nothings to each other. He was very sweet with her, which was very shocking. You see, me and my family, we're not sweet to each other at all. We have a very good relationship, but we never tell each other ""i love you"", or even things like ""you're a wonderful dad"". Even my extended family. So it was so surprising to hear my dad saying things like, you're beautiful. Heck


For a few minutes I just stood there, on record, saying, among other things: ""I love you. I love you forever and ever. Believe that.""

I know this is very naiive of me
My family prides istelf on the values of honesty and integrity. That's what I have always admired about my family. Now I'm hearing my dad sweet talk a maid with a boyfriend who borrowed money from him.
So yeah, naiive, naiive). 
 

Then there was also the fact that my dad revealed misogynistic tendencies I've never known before. In the conversation he's said stuff like, like how you're with me."" Why did he ever marry my mom if that's what he believed? My mom has been a modern, take-no-guff lady since the beginning! 

I think my brain is still too fried to think. I don't think I can ever tell my mom. Hell, anyone from my family? Or not? I don't even know what I WANT to happen. I don't even think I can tell my dad.

Brother

Mom is mom. Told my brother that if he can stay here if he won't smoke weed.

Yesterday:

Had a talk with my mom about my brother. I told her that I find him a massive douchebag because he told me directly to my face that women are dumber than men

I told my mom that she's not helping him by letting him stay here and doing drugs

The thing is, didn't give my mom a penny], he doesn't do anything at all. The worst thing is that he used to smoke in his car, away from my mom, but now he smokes in the balcony of the apartment. Thing is I live in Romania. Anyone can call the cops and if he's found out he'll get at least 4 years of prison here.

Disclaimer so I don't get menned/a little bit about me:
I'm male-bodied, that feels so good to say. Back when this happened, like 4 or 5-ish years ago, I still more or less happily identified as male and had just come out as bisexual and was a sophomore in high school. That's ... actually still what I identify as to my friends and family. I should probably change that. Go me. I'm awesome.

ANYWAY, this is at a debate camp. Important detail? Maybe. Moving right along, he asks me to have sex with him. I decline. This is at about midnight. He spends the next three hours trying to convince me to fuck him. We end up making out and he gives me a back massage. I felt a little icky, but it wasn't that bad. I thought that was the end of it. No, no, not even close. He spends the next three days or so trying to convince me to go further. I tell him to fuck off. He is having none of it. Eventually I feel kinda guilty for leading him on and getting his hopes up, since sometimes I would be friendly and flirt kind of. So I masturbated with him if he agreed never to bother me again. That jackass actually kept his word. He didn't talk to me. Sometimes he'd do little stupid things like throw pennies at me in my sleep

I didn't report this asshole because I didn't want him to get in trouble. I didn't stand up to him because I was afraid and I just admitted to the world that I like men and felt like I was lying if I didn't prove it. I felt like I led him on and that I fucking owed him.

Right so... I'm not sure what I want with this. Maybe just a listening ear? It's all so weird. I guess I'll explain from the beginning. This is going to be long.

I met the guy in 2006 when I had just started my first study along with his group of friends. They were all nice and we hit it off - it was great. We were a close pack of friends that went everywhere and suffered through exams and enjoyed good parties. Sadly I failed the study as it turned out I wasn't very good in the subjects. After 2 years (2008) I stopped and decided to follow a new one. It was in the second year (2010) of my second study that he did express interest in me via email. I remember very clearly that it was autumn and he suggested that maybe I could give him a sexy massage for his birthday a couple of weeks later. I thought he was cute so I thought sure

A week later my mother suddenly landed in a coma at 1 AM. I found out because the ambulance stopped at our house. I was completely distraught and it didn't help that the doctors told me that she could die. I forgot everything at that point, etc. All that mattered was my family. A couple of weeks later she woke up but it was clear she had a hemorrage (my English is secondary so I hope I translated that well) in her brain and she had lost some body functions. Doctors said she could recover but it could take forever and maybe even never happen at all. All in all, that time of my life was pure hell. I was always crying at night, I was always angry when I wasn't busy, I constantly forgot things, etc. I was depressed but too proud to show it.

My friends were nice, I was too worried that I'd use them. As such I ended up not seeing any of them for a long long time. My second study just completely went to shit during this time. My school didn't seem it necessary to give me extra time to prepare for my exams and of course I couldn't focus on it.

Fast forward another 3 years (2013). I had decided to work for a full year (odd jobs and such) just so I could refocus my life and earn the money I needed to pay for my third study (because I really did want to finish it, got a good job, I'm able to pay off my loan monthly and my mom is still recovering but she had made amazing progress and I'm doing so much better.

During the 3 years I got a boyfriend. He was a volunteer at the hospital. My SO helped me constantly through my rough moments even though he could've just as easily left and I don't think I could love him more. When I felt utterly broken he told me that I still had everything. I don't think I've cried more than with him but I always felt so comfortable and warm.

It was at a party where all my friends and their SOs were invited that said guy told me that he remembered a promise I made for him a long time ago. I thought it was a joke so I laughed it off, so any sparks we had were dead for me. And I honestly thought that because he never brought up the topic of 'us' again during our emails and telephone calls, he felt the same. Turns out I was wrong.

He just completely dropped me. He proceeded to ignore me in every way possible. My friends contacted me because they were wondering why the hell said guy was suddenly calling me a 'horrible slur who lied to him'. My SO think this guy is a shit, but they don't need to get involved in this mess if they don't want to. And that's where we are right now. Is this a Nice Guy? It sure sounds like it. But I always thought they gave up after a few months.

I'm not really worried about losing my friends. Most of them are intelligent and sensible and from what I heard they're on my side. I think I'm just going to throw my hands up in the air and flail about in the sun because this all sure don't make sense and I'm not planning to let this mess up my life. I've had enough of that. I just think it's so so weird.

Apologies if anywhere in this rant stuff doesn't make sense.

1348851531.0,10mjqy,I need advice about arguing the cause.,rocketsaurus,57,14,23,"So this morning

So then my hackles are raised. I start talking about heteronormativity and how it affects our views and perceptions of each other and how this particular joke would be just as effective with the use of ""Big spoon/Little Spoon"" instead of ""Guy/Girl"" and he goes on about how I'm digging too far in to everything all the time and that I'm acting like it was made maliciously etc etc. So we fight all morning and now I'm seething and hurt and angry. I feel like we can never have a conversation about actual feminist issues even though he claims to agree with the cause. It's like he's ok with me having the label ""Feminist"" but not the actual activities. 

Could I have kept my thoughts to myself and waited until we weren't fresh from dreamland? Yes. Should I censor myself around the person I am most intimate with? I hope not. 

How do you approach these things so that it doesn't get combative? He asked at one point ""Why do you have to get on your soapbox so early in the morning?"" and I just responded ""Because I never stop caring about this."" 

He's not a shitlord. We have non-traditional gender roles at our house and I have never once heard him make or laugh at a woman/rape/gay joke. It's just a case of someone not thinking that all the little things add up to big things. That photo and joke are symptoms of a larger problem. Not to mention it makes it seem like men hate cuddling and women just demand it over their partners comfort. As the predominating big spoon in my partnership I can tell you that it ain't hard to do it right and it's wicked comfy for both people. And what the fuck awkward boner? Right

This text got away from me. I understand that it was early and he's a laid back guy who just wants a joke to be a joke. But I also don't want to have to hold back from commenting on shit that isn't ok because he's got a chill vibe going on. It's ok if he disagrees and calls me out when I am going too far (it happens) but the way we go about arguing it is mean and hostile. 

**TL:DR** Boyfriend tends to think I get soapboxy too often and shuts down arguments

It goes like this, and usually with someone who seems to be fairly down with the idea of social justice/feminism/etc. I'll say something like ""when Mutual Male Friend makes these jokes, I feel disrespected/uncomfortable,"" or ""sometimes I think Completely Different Male Person really crosses the line with the way they talk about Third Friend Who Is A Lesbian."" It can even be more generic &amp; less personally charged than that, such as ""American conservatives are tacitly endorsing racist language by not calling it out and this is ruining political discourse."" 

At which point this someone aaaaaaalways feels the need to say ""Well, or you called something 'lame' the other day, and your knitting group calls itself 'stitching bitches' and that's very sexist, and you're uncomfortable around the homeless man who hangs out at your bus stop, etc, etc. You're discriminating against people all the time, so how can you judge someone else?"" 

Sometimes it doesn't even get that far; sometimes it just devolves into a long list of 'times when Kasdayeh has behaved shittily' and doesn't even get into the 'and that's why Kasdayeh can't ever judge shitlords' part.

I *know* I have privilege. I *know* that I will fuck up, and b) I am also lucky enough to have kind, smart progressive friends who will point out my fuckups in a way that encourages me not to do that shit again. Those dear people are not the same as the person who likes to list my sins.
