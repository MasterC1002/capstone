1. I use a pint of heavy cream and a small can of sweetened condensed milk. It makes quite a bit, and use a mixer or whisk to form stiff peaks. 

2. Then add in your toppings. Today I made chocolate banana. I used 3 over-ripe bananas (usually can be found heavily discounted at the store), but I like chocolate chunks. Yesterday, I made vanilla blueberry (homegrown blueberries, but I think they're on sale at Kroger this week, as well). 

3. Stick it in some tupperware, stir it up with a rubber spatula or spoon (this helps make it creamier). I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to get to full-fledged ice cream status...I never remember to pay attention...but it's not too long! 

It's cheaper even than buying store-brand

**Recipe**:

2 cups bisquick

1 egg

1/2 cup vegetable oil

1 1/3 cup club soda

""generous"" dash of vanilla extract

Also remember to preheat your waffle iron and spray with pam or crisco

Add ons:

chocolate chips! (I place them 30 seconds to 1 minute after I close the waffle iron so the chocolate doesn't burn the skillet)

Blueberries

My family has been using this recipe for years

Those who aren't familiar with it

Please let me know if you try the recipe and/or if other users know about the club soda trick and if they have any modifications to the recipe. Hope y'all enjoy your waffles.

Some personal tips:

I personally enjoy my waffles a little bit thinner so I add club soda until the batter is almost runny. Then I add vanilla extract till it passes the ""runny"" threshold

**Also**, but those who don't prefer milk may like this even more because you don't need it in the recipe.

(Recipe included.),DjJukebox206,179,49,14,"It has now been nearly 10 years since I inherited all the family recipes. I've started compiling all the old family recipes with some of my own into a new cook book. 

Below is one of my own. (Inspired by Grandma's pot roast) 
 
Sloppy Fat man French Dips

Prep Time: 30 mins. 
Cook Time: 3-4 hours

You will need:
1x Dutch oven
1x Lg. plate to let roast rest
2x Big Forks
1x Colander or Wire mesh strainer
1x Lg Bowl or high sided pan for the juice

For the Beef:
1 2-4lb roast. Doesn't matter what kind
2 tbsp Olive Oil
2 tbsp Minced Garlic
1 Med White or Yellow Onion (I avoid reds and sweets as a personal preference
Approx. 4 Cups Beef broth (+Water to cover roast) 
1 Cup cheap red wine (optional but any 2 buck chuck will work.)
Red pepper flakes
Italian Seasoning (any brand will work)
Kosher or Sea Salt
Black pepper (I use crushed tellecherry)  

 For the Sandwiches:
Hoagie or outdoor rolls (Bread works too)
Cheese (Swiss and Provalone are my favorites)
Anything else you want on the sandwich (peppers, go wild)

Prep: 

Set out roast 30-60 minutes before cooking. Lightly salt and pepper. 

Rough chop medium onion.

Preheat oven to 300'F 

Add 2-3 tbsp olive oil to dutch oven. (Let pan heat up before adding roast.)

Brown roast on all sides.  Approx 2 minutes per side. 
(If the oil starts to smoke it's too hot. Turn it down slightly.)

Roast should have a medium brown crisp

Remove roast and set aside for now. 

In the dutch oven

Combine leftover juice/olive oil and onions. 

Saute until opaque (becoming transparent.) 

Add Minced garlic

Add 2 tbsp Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp Crushed red pepper or red pepper flake. 
Add a dash dash of salt and pepper. Maybe 1 tsp each. 

Cook for another 1-2 minutes until your whole damn house smells like a pizzeria. 
Deglaze with cheap red wine.
If not using wine just deglaze with 1 cup of beef broth.
This will turn to a simmer fairly quick. When it does
Stir.

Carefully add roast. (if broth does not completely cover

Cover with lid and put in oven. 

Cook 3-4 hours

Approx 3 hrs for 2lbs / 4 hrs for 4-lbs

Check it at 3 hours with a fork. If it is beginning to fall apart

Remove roast from juice and set on plate. Shred with two big forks. 

Pour juice/onions/cooked bits into colander over large bowl. 

*Save strained juice for dipping. 

For the rolls: (I prefer toasted.)

*Toast open faced with cheese under the broiler or in a toaster oven.  

*Add beef+chosen sandwich toppings to your roll and dip the whole thing in the juice. 

This is called “Dragging it through the river.” -Sloppy as can be

Or dip it on the side. If you prefer to be civilized about it. 

Enjoy! 

Feeds 4-8  (Or just you with awesome lunches for the rest of the week.)
Goes great with just about any side. 

I've even added my homemade barbecue sauce to the leftovers and made great bbq beef. Delicious with Hawaiian rolls and pineapple slices!

First

Open the canned biscuits.  Separate the biscuits.  Flatten them slightly with your hands.  Using a shot glass

Carefully put the disk in the oil.  After 1 or 2 mins (or when it is golden brown) flip it!  Drain on paper towels.

Fry the holes as well!

8. Enjoy a burger whenever you want a quick meal
